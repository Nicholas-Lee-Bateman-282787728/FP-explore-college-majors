2452078,5,B000C1VB0A,"This anime definitely is one of the best out there for your money. I've seen many animes over my time (Fist of the North Star, Blue Gender etc) but Gantz is really unique, A cross between ""Brainstorm"", ""Aliens"" and ""Matrix: has stunning visuals, good character development, lots of action , violence and sex to satisfy anime fans.

The plot is pretty simple but explaining the rest of the series isn't. Kurono and Kato try to save a homeless man on the subway. They are apparently killed and decapitated or are they? They are transpored to a strange world that looks like their own with the exception that they have strange new powers and must kill aliens around them if they don't kill each other first. They meet ""Gantz"" a computer like being who makes them play this game of kill or be killed. We are introduced to other characters in this world like Nishi whose basically a villain watching his own back likes seeing people die.

Gantz is a great anime and you will definitely want to rewatch the episodes to pick up new things and enjoy it's development.  Keichan is a pretty decent reluctant hero, Kishimoto is sweet and kind. Kato while initially a coward becomes brave. The DVD doesn't have any great special features but if you haven't seen the anime you have to pick it up.",1151625600,4,1283,4.593886462882096
2452079,5,B000C1VB0A,"When I was thinking that a great part of the animes were looking similar, I watched this one with no great expectations. I got surprised with the realism of the characters' actions. OK the history is NOT the most incredible that I've seen in my life but that's not the point. I love the strong language, bloody violence, thats the way the characters show their feelings in the worst situations.",1150502400,2,394,4.642857142857143
2452080,5,B000C1VB0A,"GANTZ is a strange mix of an anime. It's probably the bloodiest, most disturbing anime out outside of some unmentionable hentai titles. It presents itself as something that will gross you out if it needs to and never goes away from its unflinching look at violence in today's world. Yet on the opposing end, it has a touching story of learning how to band together as a group, and of how one boy must find himself again if he wants to save those dear to him.

In this season, it follows a young, irresponsible, pervert of a kid named Kei as he faces death and then GANTZ, the robotic ball that takes charge of the lives of anyone who just so happens to die in its watch. Kei, along with his childhood friend Kato and a somewhat confused young girl named Kishimoto, now finds himself the agent of GANTZ, who charges them, along with any other victim that finds his or her way into the room where GANTZ resides, to hunt down and kill aliens in the city. What follows is a short series of shockingly violent deaths and intense battles for survival. None of the survivors come away normal because of this; yet normal is what they must become, as when GANTZ is through with them the survivors are sent back to live their lives again in wait of the next call from the black ball. Kei must face all the same things, such as school life and basic, everyday tasks, while also finding himself obscenely attached to his fellow GANTZ gamer, Kishimoto. Kato finds himself struggling with the violence of GANTZ. And Kishimoto finds herself alone in a world that has forgotten her. The stark contrast between the violent games of GANTZ and the emotional new lives the characters must live is what makes this series as brilliant as it is.

This box set contains volumes one through six of the series, and includes thirteen episodes. Below is a rundown of the volumes:

Vol. 1 Game of Death

Vol. 2 Kill or Be Killed

Vol. 3 Aftershocks

Vol. 4 Terminal Dispatch

Vol. 5 Process of Elimination

Vol. 6 Sudden Death

The reason for the number of discs is because GANTZ's original release was at a two episode per disc ratio. It left a lot of people angry at the time, but if you were interested in GANTZ yet didn't buy it because of the episode count, then now is the perfect time to get this disturbingly brilliant anime series. If you're a fan of darker anime such as, say, Ninja Scroll, which is the only normal anime I can think of that comes close to the shock-fest that is GANTZ, then GANTZ is definitely for you.",1149379200,8,2501,4.443231441048035
2452081,5,B000C1VB0A,"From the opening title song of GANTZ,u know u are getting into something different from the other mangas,wonderfuly dark and full with (not for small kids),violence. The relations between the main 3 characters is very well developed,making u care for these poor souls as the plot progresses and gets more and more complicated,it might feel a bit strange at the begining ,since as the main character itself , one also doesn't grasp what's really going on. The last two battles (or better said tasks)just go on on a frenzy of well orchestrated violence and rage,like someone here previously said,if u liked the very short but excellent Elfen Lied, well then GANTZ is definetively for you.",1149379200,,686,4.973913043478261
2452082,5,B000C1VB0A,"...But I love it. It's an odd story that grew on me. It's definitely one of the kinds of anime that you either love or hate. The ideas behind it is that Gantz has 'saved' people from the second before death to hunt aliens. Gantz is a large black orb that has a man inside of it. The main people are a bunch of teenagers. One guy thinks almost solely about females. The other guy doesn't want to kill anyone and tries to save the 1st alien they come across. The last is a girl who hides a lot behind the 2nd guy. Even in the first season there is some growth in the characters. They think about what's important and what they are willing to do to save it. I even like 'dog', a mutt that has been 'saved' by Gantz as well. The dog has zero points, but they need 100 points to be 'free'. What they mean by free, is yet to be seen. It could be a cruel joke and free means that Gantz let you finally die... I'm going to pick up the next season :)",1149120000,,941,3.931937172774869
2452083,5,B000C1VB0A,"Great stuff, kinda slow in places and doesn't exactly follow a realistic timeline (I mean two guys are shouting at each other for five minutes and the third guy isn't dead yet?) And the big chested girl? yeah, blood, guts, nudity, swearing, sex, definitely adults only!",1146009600,,269,4.869565217391305
2452084,4,B000C1VB0A,"Gantz is a lot of fun, despite being shockingly rude and gruesome in places. One day on his way back home from school, Kei, our anti-hero sees a tramp fall onto the rail tracks in the Underground station. Despite not wanting to get involved he is pressured into helping a former friend of his to rescue the tramp. Unfortunately it does not go well as he and his friend are torn to shreds by a train. However, instead of dying, they find themselves transported to a strange sealed room filled with people and a black round ball named Gantz. It turns out that each person in the room was in the process of dying when they were all transported to this room, including a suicidal girl, gangster, and school teacher. They have been given a second chance to live provided that they follow the orders given by Gantz.

Although it is the thoughts of the main character Kei who we hear it is difficult to call him a ""hero"" as he is so self-absorbed. His thoughts are filled with apathy at the world around him and the people in it. He does not want to get involved with anything or anybody and only helps others when he is forced to by others, by his own guilt, or if he thinks he has something to gain from the situation. His main motivations always seem to be lust-filled and he is constantly mentally undressing his female companions. However, by equal turns he is a very likable character and has refreshingly honest feelings. He friend on the other hand is our moral compass - he goes out of his way to help others and empathizes with the people around him.

These two contradicting old friends find themselves forced together again when the strange Gantz machine supplies them with weapons and orders them to kill an alien. And just when you thought the series could not get any stranger, we are greeted with a green onion loving (and looking) alien. What follows is a tension ridden series, full of action, bloody scenes with limbs torn apart, and some graphic nude sequences. It is by turns unpredictable, mysterious, emotionally disturbing, and exciting. The series forces you to ask yourself what you would do in their situation and recalls the feeling of Neon Genesis Evangelion in that we are faced with teenagers who are forced into battles and have to risk their lives unwillingly.

The graphics are excellent and are supplied by Gonzo.  The music and dubbing are also very good, with a cast that includes Chris Patton (from Full Metal Panic) and Spike Spencer (from NGE fame). If you enjoyed Paranoia Agent, Neon Genesis, or just want to see a compulsive character-driven action series that does not include robots, you will enjoy this. Due to the content it is recommended for those over 18 years. This complete box set contains the first 13 episodes in a thin-pack set.

This may sound silly but this is an anime series that makes you feel ""alive"" and I guarantee that by the end of the series you will not be able to stop yourself singing to the main opening credits song. Totally addictive.",1141862400,26,3000,4.6
2452085,5,B000C1VB0A,"i have to say that this is a great anime for someone who loves to follow trippy story lines and teen problems ranging from suicide to  drama at home. and there is some nudity, almost to much in some parts haha",1140393600,,209,4.097560975609756
2452086,4,B000C1VB0A,Gantz is a good anima for a mature audience hence the tv ma rating i would not recomend this for a child under the age of 13 unless the parent has watched the first two. But as i said it is a good anima .. it has alot of blood and gore and breaf nudity,1137283200,,252,3.6
2452087,5,B000C1VB0A,"This is a good series and heres why

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) One day in after school Kei Kurono was at the train platform waiting for it to come he looks around in discust at all the people and gives his true oppion on them. When he sudden sees an old friend named Masaru Kato that he hasn't seen in years, when a drunk hobo falls onto the tracks, Kato goes onto the tracks to help out the hobo, Kato calls out for Kei to help him and Kei reluctently agrees to help, as they get the hobo off the tracks they try to out run the train thats comming, but then an announcement comes that its an express train so it won't stop. As the train approaces both of them look back and then Kei says why is everyone taking a picture of us, only not knowing that Kei and Kato both got hit by the train and are beheaded with the heads rolling around spurting blood everywhere while their bodies obliterated by the train they both lay there dieing. Suddenly they both wake up in a room completely fine like nothing has happened, as they look around other people who have recently died with no one knowing whats going on they are told by a giant black ball (aka Gantz) that they are dead and to  get back to life on they must fight agents aliens to get to 100 points.

Pros: Blood, gore, violence, swearing and thoughts of sex is filled in this series. All the characters swear, characters die in horrible bloody ways all completely UNCUT so you see them die in every way you can think possible with vivid details. The Characters are in depth so you feel like you know them very well. Because of how each disk except for disk 6 on here, disks 1 to 5 on here have 2 episodes per disk so it makes you feel like you are flying threw the series quickly.

Cons: If you are a person who HATES blood, gore, violence and sex then NEVER watch this series because that is pretty much all this series is. In one of the episodes it shows a 15 second hentai (aka sex) scene between the main character and a girl, tho their privet parts are not shown the motions of sex and the screaming and touching are uncut so its a minor hentai with covered up privet parts.

Cons part 2: Most of the characters in this show are really mean and huge jerks. Except for a few everyone else is filled with hate for everyone else in the series, all they talk about is ""as long as I'm fine and not hurt everyone else around me can go to hell and I'll be happy"". Some of the charaters kill eachother before hunting the aliens just because one person said they didn't like something about another person. The Main female character  Kei Kishimoto is pretty much a freeloading complainer, by saying that all that Kishimoto does in the first season here is whine, conplain, hide behind Kato when the action gets too much, also she uses Kei (the main male character)  for a rent free house and free food then she acts like shes doing alot but her actions show that she does NOTHING but be a hinderance to the whole show.

DVD Con: As I said the most disks only hold 2 episodes, by saying that I feel like I need to get up every 40 minutes and switch disks to continue the show I feel a bit annoyed at that.

DVD Box: I love the box it comes in! it is a super thick box where the disks and dvd covers are super safe inside!

Audio: The sound is perfect through out the entire show, not one part fades or gets too loud or too soft to hear whats going on. The theme song gituar part is just awesome to listen to!

Side Note: if your a blood and guts fan then come here, if your the oppsit and hate blood and guts then stay away because all this is, is bloody. For instance if you ever seen the show Eflin Lied, think about it like except different.

Overall: I like the series so far, getting past the cons I put down its enjoyable!",1406073600,,3794,4.182191780821918

2452090,3,B000C1VB0A,"Shipping was fast and the DVD's where in good condition, the only problem was that it had DVD's 1-5 and instead of DVD 6 there was DVD 7 from Box Set 2.",1361318400,,152,3.78125
2452091,1,B000C1VB0A,"A couple of hot sex scenes, no matter how sexy, in one episode cannot make up for one of the worst time wasters of any kind I have ever seen. All the characters in this show are profoundly unbelievable.

It is understandable that one would would have major problems when first being confronted with the situation in which we find them. But to have been there more than once and still just constantly behaving in a way that goes against all sanity, common sense, and rational survival responses makes no sense to any remotely sane person.

Just having endless, pointless, ridiculous discussions while death is imminent and the necessary course of action is often agonizingly obvious. And then dying as a result?. How can this be considered worth watching?

I fast forwarded through most all of it once it became painfully apparent what it was like. IT WAS A SERIOUS WASTE OF MONEY and TIME.

I have made a few mistakes like this in my quest to find some decent anime that might not just have kiddies but older characters with more mature and thus engaging plots such as, Ghost In The Shell, Urasawas MONSTER, and Death Note, just to name a few. These jewels are far too few.

Give me all of season one of BTOOOM over this any day. At least in BTOOOM the characters do learn and apply what they learn as they go along. Looking forward to a second season of BTOOOM actually.

I guess that if nothing else it provides a lesson as to some examples of utter stupidity. Or perhaps it was meant to be funny as the viewer(s) laugh at how foolishly the characters behave. Actually there was a bit of that with the egocentric narcissistic ""horny"" boy. BUT how can anyone laugh through the whole series? No that isn't it.

All I can think of is that all the money spent on the making of this anime series was to try and keep mentally impaired viewers from making any progress and insuring that they become even more impaired. It just makes no sense. Unbelievably awful.

The mystery as to how or why anyone would spend time and money making something like this is confounding.

I whole hardheartedly agree with others reviewers her at Amazon and elsewhere who have a similar take about this incredibly bad show.",1360800000,,2199,4.560913705583756
2452092,3,B000C1VB0A,"I watched every episode of gantz, waiting for that moment where it took off and developed. Instead, it's just gratuitous violence and nudity, and then it simply ends. No explanation of any part of the story at all, the main character has hardly moved past his selfish narcissism from the start of the series, just...nothing.",1359849600,,324,4.909090909090909
2452093,4,B000C1VB0A,"Short summary of Gantz Season 1:
When a pair of high school boys (Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato) commit a selfless act of saving a homeless bum from being hit by a subway. They are killed violently and end up in a blank apartment with a huge black ball named Gantz. Also in the room is a beautiful young and suicidal women and a school teacher, a dog, a politician, a long-haired blond man, two Yakuza gang members and a mysterious young 8th-Grader named Nishi. The people quickly figure out there lives are controlled by the black globe. The only way for them to survive is to kill Suzuki aliens. The gantz ball tells them which ones to kill and gives them a hour to do so.

Dvd Specs:
The 13 episodes are compiled over 6 discs with English and Japanese voice track. The whole series has a estimated running time of 325 mins. The DVD carries a stern TV-MA rating for Intense Violence,Blatant Sexual Situations,Intense Coarse Language. The DVDS are in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen. The English track has 5.1 surround and the Japanese is in 2.1 stereo. This is a great box set but you shouldn't spend more than 25 bucks for it. This show is pretty fast at the beginning then kinda slows down in the middle then at the end leaves you wanting season 2. This is a staple for people who love violent and provocative animes. If you like this I reccomend Elfen Lied which is similar in many ways. Other than that there is nothing like Gantz. But like most adv box sets it is a very hard box and the discs fall out easily. The main story is very entertaining and the little back stories are good i found that Kishimoto's is very interesting. Overall awesome anime worth checking out.

2452094,5,B000C1VB0A,"So I love Berserk and was looking for something similar and dark (since dark, graphic and cynical anime is more of my style). I was recommended Gantz and it was right on the money. This anime shows just how diverse human society is and the way people think. Some characters are good, some scumbags, and others fight within themselves between doing what is right or just looking out for themselves. Very realistic. The story is bugged out but in a good way. Finally, the ending is strange but really cool, as opposed to many animes that have strange supposedly ""philosophical"" endings that really are just so ridiculous that the ending ends up killing the series.

Must have for dark/cynical anime fans.",1284163200,2,702,4.801652892561983
2452095,1,B000C1VB0A,"From the episodes that I saw, the series goes as such;  the main character dies, he meets up with a few other dead people and a dead dog, they fight for their life and die again including the dog.  The End.

I felt the series was a waste.",1282953600,,238,3.9166666666666665
2452096,2,B000C1VB0A,"Gantz is a highly unusual anime (and manga), with a unique combination of dark subject matter, graphic violence and sexuality, flawed characters, and science fiction. The elements are all there for a fascinating and action-packed anime season, but the season is ruined by a combination of terrible pacing and poor execution.

""Gantz"" centers around the character Kei Kurono, a deeply flawed and sexually frustrated teenage boy who, in the process of helping old friend Kato save someone's life, is killed in a train accident - or so he thinks. Instead of death, Kurono and Kato find themselves in a room with a strange being known as Gantz, who has summoned them (along with others who have died) to carry out missions to hunt aliens.

This is a brutal series to watch. The anime is not hesitant to kill characters who we come to understand and appreciate at the drop of a hat, in an absolutely gut-wrenching manner. The horror and confusion of the main characters is shockingly realistic much of the time, and the show does a good job of capturing the chaos of the situation that is its premise. It's much too easy to insert yourself for comfort.

Unfortunately, this series is bedeviled with two problems: Pacing, and a ""Filler"" ending. ""Gantz"" has downright HORRIBLE pacing, particularly after the first four episodes; it frequently slows to an absolute crawl for uninteresting and usually irrelevant dialogue. This subverts much of the shock value in the earlier part of the series, and made it very difficult to finish the series.

The ""filler"" ending (an ending made up specifically for the anime, since the series overtook the manga) is horrible as well (although mercifully limited to the last two episodes). It comes out of nowhere, irrelevant and unrelated to what came before in the story, and even ends on an uncertain note (plagiarizing the vague ending of Cowboy Bebop, with the main character's fate uncertain).

I regretfully urge you to avoid this anime (although not the manga series, which stays interesting in spite of some bizarre twists and turns in the story).",1276128000,2,2083,4.94

What it has going for it: Very original, good animation, gory, gritty story line, a lot of nudity(if that's your thing)

what's NOT going for it: Crappy action scenes, infuriatingly stupid characters, unlikable characters, really dumb unfulfilling ending.

I gave it 2 stars for good animation, original story line, and (largely failed) potential.  I'm sure if they kept the general story, but cut out damn near everything else they would have had decent show.",1268006400,2,482,5.141025641025641
2452098,1,B000C1VB0A,"I'm gonna have to give this the lowest rating.
Maybe because I read Gantz comicbook first, maybe because it stretched what's worth 2 comicbooks into a 6-DVD series.

Excuse my English, I'll try to do my best.
Story line is 99% same as the book. nothing new or indepth story line. Some of the still shots are exactly the same as the manga.
But it contains so much empty stares and still moments (reminds me of Dragon Ball series) it is really annoying. Even the characters movement sometimes is unrealistically slow (ie, standing up from a chair or reaching for something)
When it ""finally"" gets to action sequences, movements gets little better, but not much. And again, empty stares while groaning and yelling, (charaters just stands there and groans and  makes mean faces when they should move on to the next sequence) It really cuts the flow of the movie and makes me yell ""What the fvck are they doing!!!!!""
Like I said before, 2 books worth of storyline stretched into freaking SIX DVDs..

Next complaint is the Illustration Quality.  It just SUCKS. Not much effort went into the drawing of this animation.
Characters sometimes appear cross-eyed and out of proportion. Their shapes constantly change.  Eventhough some CG's were used for background, they aren't that good. This animation reminds me of poorly funded TV anime series from 90's.

Oh, by the way, Comicbook Season 1 (which is known as Phase 1) does not correspond with Animation Season 1.  Animation Season 1 and 2 contains about 2/3 of the Phase 1 storyline.  Again, not much effot went into this anime.  or the producer decided not to spent much effort on this project.  I guess they figured that the name ""Gantz"" was enough to return the revenue.

For such an amazingly original manga, this anime was a huge disapointment.  If Evangelion scored 8/10 in my book, Gantz would score 3/10.",1253577600,4,1855,4.79874213836478
2452099,1,B000C1VB0A,"This is the first time I have ever written a review about an anime. That is because I've never hated an anime as much as this one. This was the biggest waste of time ever, and this is coming from a 19 year old who has enjoyed almost every anime. I have seen almost all animes including unheard of ones, like Generator Gawl and 3x3 Eyes, to more popular ones like Bleach or Naruto.

This pretty much sums it up
The Bad:
1. takes a whole episode (literally) to decide whether to shoot an alien who is killing everyone by tearing them limb to limb
2. the only reason the main character does anything is because he just wants to do this other girl
3. the storyline details are never revealed (you are trying to figure out what the whole point of the whole story is from beginning to end) Whatever details you do get are from people trying to figure it out, but they never actually tell you what is going on.
4. (Spoiler) Everyone who goes into the room dies.
5. absolutely no point of the story since it's not even people who go there when they die, they are just copies (WTF right?)
6. Same story repeats throughout the series: 1) people die, 2) they get transported to the room, 3) they are confused, 4) they get told what is going on by the other people who have been there before and don't believe them, 5) almost all of them get killed

The Good:
1. decent animation

3. if you like wasting money",1253232000,6,1448,4.205035971223022

2452101,5,B000C1VB0A,"Ever since I first heard about Ganz, I was intrigued by the concept--the survival/contest/violence elements made me wonder if it was anything like one of my all-time favorite mangas, Battle Royale.  I watched the first episode on youtube and was so appalled by one particular scene that I decided not to watch the series at that time.

This paragraph contains spoilers for the first episode.  The scene that horrified me was the attempted rape of the main female character.  Now let me just say that I watch a lot of horror and exploitation film and I have a pretty strong stomach.  I actually love rape/revenge films like ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""Ms. 45.""  It's the *revenge* I love!  Anyway, the Yakuza thug trying to rape this girl isn't what bothered me.  The fact that no one tried to help her isn't what bothered me (well, it bothers me, but I actually thought it was fascinatingly realistic).  What bothered me is that 1) she didn't fight back at all (nor does she ever fight back when an annoying dog tries to lick her naked crotch) and 2) when the ""moralistic"" character *finally* screws his balls on and saves her, he tosses her his jacket and says ""put this on so *I* don't rape you."" For some reason this just pissed me off to no end, and I decided not to watch the show.

...But something about it stuck with me.  I really found myself wondering what happened.  The premise of the show is just so good... and I was actually interested in how utterly despicable all the characters seemed.  To make a long story short (I know, too late), when I saw seasons 1 and 2 packaged together at Best Buy for a mere $30, I caved and bought it.

I am so glad I did.  Although I'm still really bothered by that episode 1 rape scene, this is one of the most compelling animes I've ever seen.  The reason it's so good is, perversely, the same reason why I was so bothered by it in the first place: it's a disturbing show.  It's one of the most cynical and pessimistic views of humanity I've encountered outside of a Bret Easton Ellis novel.  But it constantly made me think and kept me on the edge of my couch (I literally kept jumping so high that my cat would fall off my lap).

Two suggestions if you're thinking about watching this 1) don't judge the series by the first episode (especially if you're a female viewer like me), and 2) watch it in Japanese.  I switched to English in episode 4 just to see how the voice acting was, and Kei's (the main male character) voice was so awful and I switched back immediately.  There is no way I could have gotten through the series with that voice!

More good things: The opening song is really great.  There are some seriously scary moments, especially in the last two episodes (of season 1, all I've watched so far) and some outstanding gore!  The characters kept me guessing--I don't want to give away any major plot points, but I was really surprised by some of the developments.  It's great to see a show where there are no heroes and no villains.  There are only people who are utter and total cowards, who are just trying to get by, get laid, and live one more day.  The utterly bizarre alien/machine Gantz they're up against is an apt symbolic representation of the utterly inexplicable, chaotic, and probably malevolent forces that rule our lives; in this regard, it was, like the manga of Junji Ito, very similar to the universe described by H.P. Lovecraft.  This does remind me of Battle Royale in its violent and clever ""reality show"" premise.  However, it lacks the ""moral center"" provided by Shuya and Noriko in BR--and, for me, that was actually what made this such a fascinating show.

A couple of bad things: Closing credits music sucks (and doesn't fit the tone of the show).  The ultra-weak, giant-breasted female lead was pretty annoying.  But--and again I'm talking mostly to fellow female otaku--just stick with it.  Stuff happens at the end that makes it worth the wait!

I can't wait to see what season 2 has in store... and then I'll no doubt move on to the manga.",1247356800,3,4035,4.497252747252747
2452102,5,B000C1VB0A,THIS WAS AN SATISFACTORY AND VERY THRILLING MOVIE. I DIDN'T EXPECT MANY THINGS TO HAPPEN. IT HAD ME OFF THE EDGE OF MY SEAT EVERY SINGLE MOMENT. MUSIC AND ART WERE REALLY GOOD. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOX SET TO ANYONE WHO LOVES THRILLING ANIME'S WITH VIOLENCE AND GORE. FIGHTING AND THE STORYLINE WERE OUTSTANDING. THE ONLY FAULT WAS THE RUN TIME.

2452103,5,B000C1VB0A,"I ordered this expecting something along the lines of another sci-fi alien fight story.  Instead, I got a hilarious mix of action and foul-mouthed attitude.  Some sex and lots of language, but you can find that in a lot of modern anime.  Both this and the sequel volume 2 are highly recommended.",1221091200,,295,4.634615384615385
2452104,5,B000C1VB0A,"I'm the kind of guy who loves to see action animes. But some action animes don't cut it for me *Trigun, hellsing, and so on* But then you have a action + story + characters. You don't get all three usually, most times two and since 2004 it seeems even more so your lucky to get even one of those traits. BUT this anime, gantz, In my honest opinion is one of the best action animes with a great story and very interesting characters.

First let's start off with the story. It's like a game but a bigger penalty then a ""Game over... Continue?"" screen. Best part is to actually begin playing this ""Game"" you'll have to die first. Yes you read right ""DIE FIRST"" and only THEN you'll be able to enter the game runned by a black ball. It's very interesting and sadly while the anime does get the first three arcs it only gets better so you'll have to begin to read the manga after.

Next is the characters. The main character, Kei, is the biggest P***y ever. Seriously he'll let you die as long as he'll be ok even though he could of saved you. He's also a loser and even gets caught in class with a boner. Yes this is the definition of a true loser. But as you watch this anime you'll see him change and not to mention the side characters are all good and very convincing.

Action is ace. blood? Check. Guns? Check. Swords? Check. Head explodes/chopped off? Check. A realistic take if you were put into the situation and it's done very well.

After watching over 200 animes i can still say I love this one and it's on my top 10.",1218240000,,1523,4.223367697594502
2452105,4,B000C1VB0A,"So the first season of Gantz holds the first 13 episodes, and while very captivating, brutal, and exciting, it can be offensive to some. Besides that fact many people have complained about the pacing of the show, stating that it is very slow. I do agree that it takes multiple episodes to get one thing accomplished, but I don't think it hurts the series severely. I think the best aspect of the show is its premise, the overall idea is pretty cool, but not executed totally efficiently. Instead of sexually driven cursing maniacs, the show could have implemented more emotionally driven characters we actaully would care about. While the main character's sexual fantasies can get annoying, there are more how should I say ""noble"" characters in the show. While not one of the best shows I've ever seen it is worth a watch, but not if your one to take offense to nudity, violence, and profanity. I'd say this show is for hardcore anime fans only or if your into series of the violent type.",1209859200,,988,4.651428571428571
2452106,1,B000C1VB0A,"Let me start by saying I have not even finished this anime, nor will I.  I stopped around episode 16, with the giant statues.  I also won't go into further detail on plot because I do not want to give anything away to those poor souls who are actually looking forward to this garbage.
I heard great things about this series in my scouting of new shows to watch so I decided to give this one a shot.  Boy was I wrong to even consider this.  It's not the asinine plot that goes nowhere episode after episode that disappoints me.  Or the ""state of the art"" animation which blends CG and hand drawn about as well as scat and ice cream.  Its the ridiculously slow pacing.
In some cases, the character spend half the episode (no joke) debating whether or not to shoot an alien that is threating their lives.  In the show, the characters are granted these amazing weapons that appear to have unlimited ammo, no recoil, really no faults.  So what do our awesome heroes do?  Nothing.  Thats right, nothing!  The creators are obviously trying to build suspense, but ultimately fail and, instead, create a very boring and uninteresting cartoon.
Despite what most say, the animation is horrible.  The CG is primarily used for scrolling backgrounds when the characters run.  Its more of a lazy trick than an actual attempt to do something worthwhile.
If you have morals or a weak stomach (both of which I lack) than steer clear of this train wreck regardless.  It has everything from rape, to gory deaths, to very questionable ethics.  If these things disturb you, don't say I did not warn you.  It doesn't bother more so than infuriate me with the way they use these shock tools.  An example is the main character.  All he thinks about is getting laid.  Its entertaining once or twice to throw that in there.  Its funny!  But the protagonist literally eats sleeps and breaths this obsession.  Its sad to watch.  No one, I mean no one acts like that.  Nice try to spice it up team Gantz.  I'm not buying it.
Speaking of which, neither should you.  I give this the lowest rating I have ever given anything.  At least the opening song is catchy...",1208217600,14,2132,4.52755905511811
2452107,2,B000C1VB0A,"When I first found this boxed set at the store I was intrigued.  I went out and did a lot of research, including using this site, to decide whether it was worth my time and money.  Sadly, it was not worth either.

As stories go, Gantz has a good one.  People being 'saved' from death by a mysterious orb and then being forced to fight to live one more day is a compelling plot.  The initial characters even have great backgrounds that run from self-absorbed loner to do-gooder.

The problems with Gantz start to come out once the characters have all been killed.  The main character becomes a horny, whiner who's only motivation is to sleep with the girl with a larger then life chest.  The girl spends all her time worrying about the do-gooder and the do-gooder is too obsessed with keeping everyone alive, and he gets people killed by doing nothing.

You've now been told bascially all of the character development you will find in this series.  What you're really after is the fight sequences.  Unfortunately, these boil down to the characters spending half their time arguing and the other half whining about not wanting to die.  In the end you have a gun fight lasting multiple episodes, helped by the fact that the first 2 minutes of every episode is a rehash of the end of the previous one.  Characters die in mere seconds and then the survivors spend up to 5 minutes staring in shock and saying 'this can't be happening!'

The English voices of the characters are passable, except the main one.  His whiny attitude is enhanced by a squeaky, childish voice.  The art is very well done, the computer generated sequences aren't overbearing, and the music is unobtrusive.

Overall, the show is quite beautiful to watch except that the story falls very short.  This entire series(season 1 and 2) could've easily been compressed into a 2 hour film, and it would've been much easier to stomach.

Lastly, there are some major warnings here to anyone considering letting kids watch this with them.  There are multiple sex scenes, all involving the underage(he is 16) main character and other underage characters.  There is also quite a bit of very graphic violence, including decapitations, dismemberment and the like.  If you're into this type of thing and don't mind blowing money on a weak storyline that drags on and on, then by all means, please buy this today.",1200441600,4,2365,4.717073170731707
2452108,3,B000C1VB0A,"After hearing a lot of good things about this anime I decided to give it a shot. I must say after watching all the episodes, I was mildly impressed. Animation is top notch, pretty darn good if say so myself, but that script..man...horrible. It almost seems as if a little kid wrote the script and gave to some adults...not impressed there, voice acting was bearable in Japanese, but in English! Do yourself a favor and watch it in Japanese with subs...you'd enjoy it more that way...Not raggin' on the voice actors (love Chris Patton btw) but it seems the script they had to work with wasn't that much better than the Japanese ones..in fact it's worse! Story line was ok until the end...kind of disappointed they couldn't keep it more faithful to the manga...but since it was done way to early in the stages of the manga that's what I'd expect. Frankly I thought they should have waited and let it be a 50 something episode series, IMO it would have been a better series that way...BTW, this show is definitely not for kids..there is LOTS of gore, violence, an act of rape (that was thwarted of course), and softcore sex scenes...so yeah.. not for those faint of heart or younger than 16, I'd say...in all it was an ok anime, the violence really stuck out...but other than that...eh 3.5",1195171200,,1286,4.595652173913043
2452109,2,B000C1VB0A,"I must say that I do admire the premise behind the story, and what I believe the writer and director were trying to create here, but the first 13 episodes (which is all you get in this box set, by the way) were very difficult to watch.  I say this because the idea behind showing the true nature and thoughts of an emotionally corrupt society is interesting, but the show has too many flaws to be enjoyable.

Even though the visuals and voice acting are pretty good, the actual product is lacking any kind of structure and suffers from horrid pacing.  Add on top of that the schizophrenic jumping between very mature themes of the non-sexual kind, with the constant immature ramblings of the ""main"" character's sexual desires and self centered whining, and you end up with a story that goes no-where very slowly.  This actually touches on the main problem with the first season, you simply have no desire to see any of the characters survive.

This is not a series I will ever watch again.  Even though I have read that the second box set actually gets better, this first season is a waste of money and time.",1179273600,4,1108,4.515
2452110,3,B000C1VB0A,"Well, I have to say, this definately had it's good points and definately bad points.

First of all, the first season came without the first volume, which upset me very much. But when I started watching the second I could tell that I didn't miss much anyway. They started off very slow and there was nothing but screaming and confusion. No one knew what to do except Nishi, a sixth grader who committed suicide and ended up in the room with Gantz and other dead people.

The story. Gantz is a black sphere with a comatose guy in it who picks certain people who have died and copies them and brings them into an invisible world where they have to play a deadly game and defeat various alien foes. When they are in the game they have an hour to accomplish this. Kurono and his friend Kato were taken after they tried to save a bum from an oncoming train and paid with their lives. Kishimoto is a vuluptuous virgin vixen who tries to commit suicide because her mother has no faith in her abilities to go to school. There are others but, well, you'll see.

There is a lot of dialog and indecisiveness amongst the characters when they first start the game and most of the time they just stand there with their mouths open and wondering what to do. The thing that igged me was how slow they caught on. There is not much of a fight going on until the end of the season.

I purchased both seasons and in the second season...well I won't spoil it too much, but, I can tell you there is more action (sexual included) and more surprises.

One thing though make sure when you purchase anything from here check it and makesure you're not missing any disks or get repeated disks, as in my case. I got two volume threes and no volume one, I was really mad. Enjoy!",1175990400,,1747,4.314024390243903
2452111,4,B000C1VB0A,"Gantz is probably one of the best anime I've watched this year, not the best but it's up there. I don't know where to start but I think I'll try to explain what Gantz is all about first. Gantz is a sphere located in an apartment. The only thing people recognize is Tokyo tower right outside the window. Gantz has a mind of its own but no conscience or feelings. The sphere has a huge arsenal of futuristic weapons that pop out of it including special suits. It also holds a man who looks like he's on life support inside of it; he resembles the crazy old man in the film Saw 3. It's not said if the man is of any importance in the first season cause he never moves or talks but maybe some info will be given in the second season.

Gantz collects people right after they've died on earth but only a select few. When the people get to the room Gantz informs them that their lives have ended with the words written on the black surface of the sphere. Gantz also writes ""what you do with your new lives is entirely up to me"". And they begin to play a game for their lives but who knows if it ever ends. The objective is to kill a bunch of insane aliens that Gantz finds or picks out, who knows how it finds them but it does.

The story's main character is Kei Kurono but he is far from anyone's hero and really only cares about himself. As a matter of fact Kei spends a lot of time in the series trying to lose something, ""If you know what I mean""? Kei runs into his old friend Kato in the subway but their conversation is cut short when a man falls on the tracks. Kato immediately wants to help the man and asks for Kei's help, it takes a few minutes for Kei to stop being selfish and help the man. The two help get the man off the tracks but end up putting themselves into danger and well let's just say that's when the anime starts to get a little messy.

Not every anime is perfect and I had some problems this first season. I think Gantz is amazing but it does have some problems that maybe could have been avoided. For one like a lot of people said it does have bad pacing. Gantz will spend unneeded minutes on conversations and even battles. A character could be getting ready to shoot the alien but takes 5 minutes to think about things like the past. Another problem is that for some reason the weapons are too complicated for these guys and it takes a number of episodes before anyone gets trigger-happy. The story also takes a little too long to develop for every episode. It's hard to realize in the middle the series if it's still one that has puzzle pieces in each episode that add up at the end or if the other episodes meant nothing at all. The main reason for those problems can most likely be chalked up to this anime being made while the Manga was still in its early stages.

No matter what even through the bad pacing something about Gantz is addicting and I think it's mostly the unique and edgy style it has. Kei is a great main character because he actually grows up with the series and even looks like he'll turn into one of the best players. Plus it has an ability to intrigue you; you want to know what's going to happen to Kei and Kato. You want to know what happens to the other characters that actually made it through Gantz's firsts stages. The voice acting is great and so is the music, which fits perfect for the Gantz style. The animation is very cool and is actually one of the things that attracted me to the series most. I think the first season is a perfect 4 stars because no matter the flaws it still holds you and makes you hunger for season 2.",1172966400,2,3580,4.1765557163531115
2452112,5,B000C1VB0A,"I can see why critics call this the series that shocked Japan. It's intense. Definitely not for people who don't like graphic violence, strong language or nudity.

I highly recommend this to anime lovers everywhere.",1172620800,,355,4.741935483870968
2452113,4,B000C1VB0A,"Not top rated but fun to watch.  The plot is a bit weak.  The art is excellent.  Dubbing is well done.

Just what you would expect with the 16 year old school boy, hero who seems to be a bit preoccupied with the wrong problem; he is dead!  But that doesn't seem to faze him one bit.  I'm going to have to buy season 2.  It's that funny.

The only problem is that there are only two episodes per disk and it seemed I was always getting up to put the next disk in.  I ended up watching the whole thing in one sitting.

This is a very heart wrenching experince that will keep you on your toes with anticipation of the things to come. There is some nudity, but the nudity wasn't there just for kicks, it was there for charcter development. This is a very interesting anime worthy of checking out.

2452115,3,B000C1VB0A,"First the good-

1) Action. Lots of it.

2) It keeps your attention and can be unpredictable at times. A good story, good voice acting and did I mention action?

3) There is some nice animation here. You can tell the production values were pretty high for this series.

4) What's it about? Well, that's a tough one. There is this big black metal ball in this empty room that teleports the recently dead to it. They are ""alive"" and have to kill aliens or be killed. The ball provides a protective costume and a gun to each, if they can figure it out and don't kill each other, they get to go back and live again for a while. Until the next time Gantz (the ball) calls them

  Oh, also there is someone inside Gantz. Which leads to....

The Bad

1) Lots of unanswered questions. WAY too many. I mean, sure, I like a good mystery and I don't want Everything neat and answered, but questions keep popping up and are just left there. Where did Gantz come from?Why is it doing this?

Anyway, it is worth watching. The gore content is a bit high, btw. So it is not for those who are squemish. Perhaps there will be an OVA follow up in thwe future?",1167523200,,1140,4.211981566820277
2452116,2,B000C1VB0A,"The most frustrating aspect of this series is when you're yelling at the screen for the fools to get on with their task... and you will do this for EVERY episode.  The characters do a lot of standing around talking and, depending on whether the plot requires it or not, the villains will either patiently wait for them to finish, or take advantage of the inaction and kill someone.

While on missions, none of the characters react to their particular situations in a manner that is even imaginably believable.  Yet, when they are returned to their normal lives, the story shifts to an endearingly humanistic spectrum.  It is during these times that the writing is the best.  Still, the mystery of Gantz is suppose to be the most compelling, but sadly, the writing in these areas just falls apart.

Aside from all that, the artwork is top-notch and the action, as rare as it may be, is pretty good.",1167091200,2,897,4.610062893081761
2452117,4,B000C1VB0A,"Gantz is a real surprising gem.  There are some pacing problems and maybe a bit slow for many viewers.  There's long philosophical debates that elongate fight scenes.  However, if you can make it to the end it's an amazing story that is well thought out (even though the ending of the series leaves much to be desired - apparently the manga has not ended so I'm curious if the anime will be extended).

The animation is extremely graphic in violence and has nudity so it's definitely designed for adults (18+) though the main charaacters are in high school.  Which is a little weird because there's a bit of perverse/immature scenarios that would be more intended for a younger audience - so the tone doesn't quite match.  However, that's not the main core of the series.  It deals with some powerful and important themes - standing up for yourself, fighting for what you believe in, and self discovery.

If you want something that is a non-stop ride, do not get this.  If you want something deeper, meditative and can wait for a longer resolution, this may interest you.  If you liked Blood the Last Vampire anime - you'll dig this.  The action is pretty cool and the character design is awesome.",1164326400,,1197,4.652380952380953
2452118,5,B000C1VB0A,"Gantz is a tense, emotion wringing story with a lot of blood and a side portion of sex.  Unless you are very tolerant of hardship, blood and sex this isn't for young children.  Parents won't want their children to watch these episodes until they are 18, teenagers will love watching the show when they are 15 and perhaps even a bit younger and will miraculously be totally unharmed except being exposed to a couple of interesting ideas.

Ideas (certainly not comprehensive):

1) What happens after you die could be Heaven or Hell, could be nothing, or it could be something else entirely that no one has considered before

2) Young men tend to be more horny than have sense.  (Amazing how for some reason this just isn't projected most times there are teenagers around)

3) Materialist idea of 'you' or 'I'.  It appears that almost all of the characters in the show are 'captured' at the time of their death and recorded and transported to Gantz.  This either implies that the soul is recordable and recreatable or that the soul is unnecessary in the recreation of a person.

4) The weaponry appears to be fairly original.

Kei Kurono is certainly the most interesting character in the series.  He can be annoying and is certainly obsessed with sex, but I think that merely makes him a relatively accurrate depiction of a teenage male.

One of the key points in this very violent series is that violence is real and although the activities in the Gantz games are certainly violent, you can't get away from violence even in a place that should be safe like home.  This is demonstrated by Kato's little brother being beaten by their Aunt that is taking care of them because their parents are dead.

The effects of violence at home, rather than violence in the Gantz activities are what appear to motivate Kato to incredible rages.  Kato, who is the most reasoning character in the series.  Kato, who is unable to kill in order to survive or even protect his friends - is driven by the violence at home and school to beat people insensible.

The series is neat.  Not all questions are answered in the first series.  Nor, I suspect are they answered completely in the second season.  Some questions perhaps we do not have the answers.  Some answers are held in the Manga and possibly Japanese Anime versions of the show.

I hope they continue to produce Gantz Anime, and perhaps some of those answers will be revealed.  Perhaps it will be like the original Guyver series.  One of the best Anime I've watched and I was horrified that the end, was in fact the end.  Clearly a show (just as Gantz) that there is plently of material to continue the story.

While I'd love to continue reading the story in the Manga, it appears to currently not be available in English.

I will hope that people will be able to watch this show and not be put off by the sex and violence contained within it - just as they are contained in real life.  It certainly provided me with a nice diversion.

Oh, and yes, I hate the fact that there are only 2 episodes per disk.  Who makes that kind of decision?  I have anime with 5 episodes per disk, 2 episodes per disk but most commonly 4 episodes per disk.

Don't waste resources people!  13 episodes could have easily fit on 3 disks compared to 6!  The extra disks, cost to the manufacturer, extra materials for disk holders and the large box - man - it just makes sense to shave some cents off the cost of the series and sell it for the same amount and make more money than waste all those disks with 2 episodes each.

Blech.  Good thing I really like the series.

Atheists, agnostics and secular humanists will probably enjoy this series as well as people who are fairly moderate in temperance.

Folks that take their religion too seriously, don't like anime, don't like sex or feel that there is too much violence on TV - need not apply.

Funny how this is a Japanese animation, with so much blood, guts and sex and they have lower incidences of violence in their country than in the USA.  Must not be the violence and sex on TV that causes the problems, folks!  If blood, guts and sex on TV causes it in reality then Japan must be overrun with roving gangs, rapes and thousands of murders, but we know this is not true.",1162425600,15,4244,4.486945169712794
2452119,2,B000C1VB0A,"This program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.

The art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn't look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak.

The worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the ""action"" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don't feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I.

Transported to a strange post-death limbo, the pair find themselves in a barren room overlooking Tokyo with a motley group of strangers--including two hotheaded gangsters and a naked young girl, whom they immediately try to rape--as well as a mysterious black sphere known as Gantz.

I asked her what it was about and she replied only with a smile.  I can tell you one thing.  I sat through the entire series with my jaw on the floor.  I was in awe of the story line and characters at every turn.  At first it seemed to resemble a few other animes that I have seen but after the first few episodes it veres sharply to the right and starts carving a new path through the mountain.  Its characters are an odd assortment to say the least.  They are definatly not your typical anything.  They are way out in left field on all terms.  One minute your sitting there thinking, ""no way they're going to.....oh holy s**t they did.""  or your sitting there thinking ""this could be even better if.....wow this DVD just read my mind"".  Tha animation in the series is well done.  There are a few instances where it seems rushed and missing a few inbetweens but over all it holds up fairly solid and consistant.  All in all I highly recomend for any horror/scifi fan.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you wondering, what the h*ll just happened.  And not to worry the ending is acctually good!! it doesnt have a cop out ""evangelion/razephon"" ending.

Unlike the supernatural supposition that is posed in the Haibane Renmei series, Gantz is a high tech machine sphere that assigns the group of the near- or newly dead on nasty alien extermination missions. The central characters of season one are of high school age and all manner of dysfunction are seen in their interactions with their classmates, family & relatives, and everyone else around them. What is different about this is the viewer gets an insight into what everyone in the room is thinking as though they were thinking aloud. The character, Kei, who has the best chance of beating whatever game Gantz is playing had been obliterated in a mostly graphic, gory way by an express train after helping a homeless drunk get off the rail tracks.

In the missions, characters can still die a most horrible death (again), but if they manage to be even barely alive, Gantz will stitch them back as a whole person when it transports them from the mission area. So even if Kei were to gain the 100 mission points to salvation, it might just be all for nothing and perhaps that'll be explained in season 2. There story gives glimpses into character personalities of those who have attempted suicide and failed, attempted suicide and succeeded, those who didn't make much of their lives and didn't expect to die so soon, etc., and how these characters react to other people after the fact that they're pretty much dead and stuck in some alternate universe that no one really understands or cares to understand. The series poses interesting What if? scenarios. Overall, the art was decent and the first person character perspective reminded me a lot of the Ghost Master pc game.

2452123,5,B000C1VB0A,This is one of the best anime series out now bar none. It is rare for a work loaded with so much sex and violence to tell such a compelling story. Can't wait for the 2nd half.,1154995200,,175,3.7567567567567566
2452124,5,B000C1VB0A,"I have to admit first off that I am not an anime fanatic, but I have seen a few. This particular series, however, I watched in 3 days...yes, the whole series. From the beginning I was hooked with the graphic violence and the humorous and often true to life thoughts of the main character. Upon getting through the first 6 or so episodes, I could not stop watching! It was almost painful to stop watching it. I related so much with the characters and their struggles (even though mine are not so adventurous) that I could not help identifying and truly being there with them until the end... Without saying much about the story itself, I would advise anyone who is into anime, even a little, to get this series. I bought the box sets, but I am sure that after the first volume you will be hooked.",1154476800,,795,4.378378378378378
2452125,2,B000C1VB0A,"Really people, 5 stars? While the plot of Gantz seems like it would make a great series, what was achieved in two seasons could have been done in two DVDs. I kept wanting to yell at the TV, ""GET ON WITH IT!"" I wanted to know more about the characters and I wanted to see how they would overcome this strange situation they were thrust into and I wanted to see more monsters. But alas, all I got was DBZ feeling fights going on for many episodes and endlessly whining characters.

The art in Gantz is beautiful. The concept is so cool. The characters are rich and feeling. It just takes too long to get to the point and then leaves you empty with a confusing ending and bad plot holes.

Definatly NOT 5 stars.",1152230400,5,708,4.237037037037037

8095208,5,B000C1VB0A,"Gantz is an anime that was adapated from the mmanga of the same name, which was written and illustrated by Hiroya Oku.  The story follows a teenager named Kei Kurono, who dies in a train accident with Masaru Kato, in an attempt to save a homeless man from dying on the tracks.  They soon find themmselves placed in a semi-posthumous ""game,"" where the recently deceased are forced to hunt and kill aliens hiding in Japan.

Rather than review this, since reviews are entirely subjective, I've decided to try something new.  Below, you will find simple points that will help you determine whether to watch this series or not.

Fun Factor
Dark humor and tragic.

Harem Factor
Low.  Only 2 women desire the lead.  The 2nd one, less so.

Sex Factor
Medium.  There are 2 pretty explicit sex scenes, the 2nd of which is shown several times.  However, no genitals are shown.

Nudity Factor
Medium.  There are plenty of bare boob shots.  But nowhere near as many as you would find in High School DxD.

Oddity Factor
High.  There is no explanation about the different types of aliens, or why they need to be killed, who Gantz is and why he's doing this, or how anyone is being cloned.

Gore Factor
High.

Language Factor
High.

Violence Factor
High.

Verdict
This is a very adult anime, filled with nudity, graphic violence, graphic language, and a fantastic soundtrack.  However, there is no resolution to the series.  In the end, you know just about as much about the situation as you did going in.",1447545600,3,1489,4.6461538461538465
