2924644,5,B000UR9TJG,"I was one of the fortunate few that got tickets to see this taping live.  I've seen Jimmy perform on numerous occasions, but this was by far his finest hour.  If you're looking for a great example of his work, look no further.",1188432000,10,226,4.232558139534884
2924645,5,B000UR9TJG,"Jim Norton is fantastic, if it's your style. I really enjoy being able to step back, not be offended at the off-the-wall comedy style he brings to the table.  I've always liked his material -- from Opie and Anthony, to Lucky Louie, to his stand up spots on various late night shows and Comedy Central.

However, here's my warning to the parents -- do NOT watch this with young children. Jim Norton is incredibly vulgar and touches on subjects best left until they're old enough to know right from wrong, and words to not say. Trust me -- you do NOT want your kids repeating his stuff around town.

That said -- he touches on subjects that people just don't normally talk about. His comedy goes from sexual, to social issues, to politics. He's not afraid to offend every single group out there, and make you laugh while he does it. If you can take his comments as comedy and leave your sensibilities home for a bit and not take yourself and everything around you seriously, he's going to make you roll around in your chair in hysterics. Otherwise, you'd do better with a lighter comic.",1351814400,,1084,4.520408163265306
2924646,5,B000UR9TJG,"years from now, jim norton will be listed as one of the greatest comedians to ever step foot on a stage & pick up a microphone.  he is simply brilliant, and should be known to everyone with a pulse.  i've read his books, bought his cd's & dvds, listened to him on O&A, & seen him live numerous times; every time i see/hear him, i prepare to be highly entertained.  he is truly one of the greatest.",1262649600,,397,4.12987012987013
2924647,5,B000UR9TJG,"Even my often offended girlfriend gave in and laughed through this show. She even has asked to watch it again and wants others to see it. I have heard Jim before and love his comedy, but to win over my girl... that's pretty good. She was only mildly amused when she watched Eddie Murphy's 'Delirious'. I love that in the company of others, during a boring conversation, she'll look over at me and whisper, ""Monster Rain!"" and then imitate Jim's oral technique.",1248048000,2,460,4.621951219512195
2924648,1,B000UR9TJG,"After you listen to this guys act you may never want to have sex again.  At least I just hope I never run into any of is former girlfriends.  He won't date a woman unless she will perform ""analingus"" on him, and spends half hs act talking about this very thing.  It seems he'd rather do that than have normal sex with a woman.  And if this doesn't make you want to throw up maybe his story of how he gave oral sex to his best buddy in 2nd grade...multiple times under the front proch.  Norton says he likes women but too mch of his act has a homosexual slant to it.  The rest of his act is basically low-brow humor-- cussing in place of creative humor, like something a little kid would put together.  I saw Norton on Leno and made the mistake of taking him as an intellectual comedian.  What a mistake, Jim Norton's humor could only appeal to pure trailer trash.",1237420800,3,863,4.219512195121951
2924649,5,B000UR9TJG,"I love this sick twisted LIL man he's honest and doesn't hold back anything you will go where most of you wouldn't dare you've been warned
I saw this taping live great stuff  this is a must buy SO BUY IT NOW !~",1221436800,,210,3.883720930232558
2924650,5,B000UR9TJG,Yeah so this is one of the best dark comics around... I dig'em. This DVD does not disappoint!!,1217203200,,94,4.277777777777778
2924651,5,B000UR9TJG,"Jim Norton has two DVDs on the market: This one and ""One Night Stand"". While tha latter is really pretty weak compared to Nortons two CDs (Yellow Discipline & Trickets I Own Made from Gorilla Hands) this DVD has Norton back with his special ""crindge""-edge. His humor is no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners, and there will be plenty of people for whom his humor is way too extreme, but his is a very funny guy. If you like dirty comedy (Stanhope, Atell, Carlin and the like) you will enjoy this one tremendously. Still, a word of caution: i would still start with the CDs. Compared to those days, Norton has lost weight and is slimmer now. As glad as I am for him, some of his self-hating jokes are not possible anymore.",1215648000,,718,4.573643410852713
2924652,5,B000UR9TJG,"Mr. Norton is the funniest comic out there hands down.  All of his content is original and is equally offensive to all races, sexual orientations, and Genders. Great HBO special!",1210291200,,178,4.933333333333334
2924653,5,B000UR9TJG,"This was James Nordens last work before dying of a terrible disease. actually the picture (lead umbrella) was from the hospital during X-rays to try to find a cure. He stayed funny till the end. there is a comic that does a tribute act and goes by ""Jimmy Norton"" who carries on the Norden tradition everyday on The Opie & Anthony Show on XM 202. linger laskladjnKLDJ

2924654,5,B000UR9TJG,"This is a must have...I love you Jimmy.....

I was at the live taping of this exact show! Get this if you have any funny bone in your body (don't confuse a body with what Jimmy calls his).  I will be also seeing his live show in Chicago at the Lakeshore April 25th.  Take a look and see for yourself.",1207699200,,300,3.966666666666667
2924655,5,B000UR9TJG,"The absolute funniest DVD I have ever watched.  Put this in shopping cart, Jimmy needs the money for a whole new closet full of raincoats in case he gets stuck in a another one of those monster rain storms.",1201392000,,206,4.282051282051282
2924656,5,B000UR9TJG,"Simply the best. My Idol James Padington Norton has out done himself with this fine slice of heaven, it is not only hysterical from beginning to end, but also teaches lessons about life and love through out. MONSTER RAIN will have you gasping for air. (because of the fact that your enjoying such a good natured chuckle.) tee hee hee.
if for some strange reason you don't buy this dvd, maybe consider investing in a desert eagle, and blowing your brains out.",1201132800,,458,4.597560975609756
2924657,5,B000UR9TJG,"What can be said about Jim Norton?  That he's a funny, talented, and sometimes brutal comedian.  His set is constantly evolving, I saw him perform just a couple of weeks before this was taped and had seen him a few months before that, and this DVD has great material that was not at either previous performance or his earlier recordings.  Both of his CD's and his previous HBO DVD are great as well, check them out. --Travis from Kansas",1197331200,,436,4.493670886075949
2924658,5,B000UR9TJG,I've heard him on the radio but this is just too funny.  Jim Norton just nails this performance.  60 minutes of tear enducing laughter.,1197331200,,135,4.583333333333333
2924659,5,B000UR9TJG,"Even though he insulted my grandmother, I have to give credit where credit is due. Jim Norton is a funny man, from any prospective.",1196467200,,131,4.5
2924660,5,B000UR9TJG,"This was the funniest standup I've seen in years!  I recommend this to any Jim Norton fan.  Aspect ratio is in widescreen, which is a plus.  Just as funny as his HBO One Night Stand, but longer!  Get this now!",1196294400,,209,4.15
2924661,5,B000UR9TJG,One of the funniest stand up comedians of all time...Jim Norton is hilARIOUS and in his finest form in Monster Rain.  From his simple ordinary childhood antics to his fondness for the female anatomy you will not stop laughing!  A must for a fan of a meaty breasted zilch and O&A!

2924662,4,B000UR9TJG,"I was at the 2nd show of Lil Jimmy's at the Lincoln Theater. I've seen our boy before in Virginia and I love the hell out of his style. I liked the live show so much better than seeing him on tape however.
I'm glad Norton has a girlfriend now and is happy- I think he's funnier though when he can relate to  us as a horny loser instead of an established STABLE NY/LA semi-star. He's great on the radio with his little asides and inappropriate inferences and I loved him on ""Tough Crowd"". I truly see his future as a panelist or columnist. Could you imagine Norton on a format ""Match Game"" or ""Hollywood Squares""??
I'm not saying Jim's not strong enough to carry a show by himself. I loved his material on Ann Coulter,John Edwards,Imus..I will never look at a Basset Hound again without imagining a miners hat on it. I think he is the perfect third man on the team and he should avoid overexposure.
Sadly, the ""extras"" on the video are limited to two scenes cut from the show. There are no behind the scenes, no outside crowd scenes with the signings with Opie and Anthony(which was very lively).
(BTW Jimmy, still love you man, but the Lincoln Theater is not a ""bad"" neighborhood, it's a pussified, yupped-out urban area with typical coffee houses and galleries...)",1193616000,,1265,4.5

Well, l did like the part where Jimmy disrobes to his diapers and recites Homer's ''The 0dyssey''.",1192492800,,312,5.285714285714286

It's pretty dirty so you aren't going to want to play it around the kids if they are under 18 or whatever. Otherwise, I can't recommend it highly enough!!!",1516579200,,286,4.415094339622642

8214474,5,B000UR9TJG,"A typically vulgar show from Norton, a well rounded comic, who touches on various topics like std's and the adult video awards. Jim Norton gets extremely close and very personal. A must see for fans of down and dirty comedy that would probably make Carlin blush in his grave.",1482364800,,275,4.63265306122449
8214475,4,B000UR9TJG,"Jim Norton in 2016 has a well established stand up act  composed of self depreciation, shock, and brutal honesty. You know, the type of honesty that you cant admit in public. In a time where it seems everyone is offended by everything Jim Norton is solidified as one of the few voices inthe comedy world that responds to modern sensitivity with a resounding ""tough s***.""  To call him rough around the edges is an understatement but his act has been well polished. Jim Norton in 2007 on the other hand had  an act that was aching to break through and keep alive that gritty pessimistic view of American culture that had been glorified previously by the likes of George Carlin. This act that has such potential and promise was still blossoming however. His timing is good but not perfect. His inflection and animation is solid but not spectacular. By no means is Monster Rain lacking in funny and quality content but was essentially a rough draft to what would become ""A"" material. Norton's improvement in his material and performance over the past decade is noticeable and his ""rookie"" outing in Monster Rain is a high quality start to whats become a successful career born and bred on the fringe of decency.",1481673600,,1208,4.7156398104265405
