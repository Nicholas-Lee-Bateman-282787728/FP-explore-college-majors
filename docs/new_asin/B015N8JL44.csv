Sound design was one of the best I have heard from an anime from this era besides Angels Egg.

Visuals were stunning and vibrant although still is overshadowed by Angels Egg.

Also something that you could watch with your kids unlike Angels Egg",1515024000,,373,4.707692307692308

8734002,4,B015N8JL44,"Based on the 1927 short story of the same name by Kenji Miyazawa, this Group TAC animated feature is one of the best Anime film's of the 1980's. Reminding any viewer of a certain age of a mix between Fantasia and Galaxy Express 999 (the latter of which was heavily influenced by the original short story). This film balances a somewhat dark tale with beautiful uplifting set piece moments and a truly peaceful ambient soundtrack that offers viewers a journey that is both captivating and relaxing. The film is about as charming as can be. As for Discotek's new Blu Ray release overall it's a solid package.

The Video presentation is staggeringly detailed but at times does show the age of the print which while it has clearly been well cared for does on occasion show a significant amount of dust and a few scratches, most notably in darker scenes. It doesn't deter from the viewing experience though and is never a problem even at it's worst. In comparison to the Old Central Park Media DVD releases it's simply a no contest, this Blu Ray is one of the best looking for a Classic Anime film that I've seen.

The Audio options offered are English 2.0, Japanese 2.0 and Japanese 5.1, I don't have the setup to really offer a great opinion on the quality of the audio but having checked out all 3 options I found nothing at fault.

The English Dub offers decent performances and while some casting choices are considered debatable by fans (Crispin Freeman as Campanella sounding slightly too old for his role, but I personally enjoy his performance) and a few voices being perhaps too similar to other roles. Specifically Veronica Taylor who was the original voice for Ash Ketchum in Pokemon and does little to change her voice for this performance so big fans of Pokemon may find her performance distracting. The Voice actor for Professor Oak from Pokemon also appears as the Light House keeper and again does little to differentiate his voice for this role. But despite all this I believe this to be a perfectly adequate English adaptation that stays remarkedly true to the Japanese script.

The Extras include a good commentary by Anime Network's and all around Anime super fan Mike Toole who once again offers great insight and history on those who made the film. He is joined by Justin Sevakis who worked at Central Park Media when they made the English Dub back when and he also authored the Discotek release, he is clearly a big fan of the original story and offers some interesting insight to the original creation of the English version as well as lot's of information on Kenji Miyazawa and once again the film itself. It's a good listen and is paced just well enough that despite the long running time of the film both are seldom silent for long. It's a laidback commentary but it matches the film in that regard and is certainly a worthwhile listen.

The rest of the Extras are 3 trailers, two of Japanese origin (in HD) and the original Central Park Media Trailer for their English version (in SD). Unfortunately there are a couple of Extra's missing from the original Central Park Media release including an Art Gallery (which was mostly screenshots) and History (which in this case is mostly covered in the commentary) so neither are a big loss but a shame that perhaps the History extra was ported over in some form.

Overall this is a great release from Discotek of a true Classic of Japanese cinema and animation. Those interested in classic Anime would be foolish not to add this to their collection and those who own the old Central Park Media release should immediately upgrade as the quality of this Blu Ray against the old DVD (which I wouldn't be surprised if it were a VHS transfer) is simply a no contest. Definitely a worthwhile purchase for all Anime fans.",1461283200,10,3782,4.671171171171171
8734003,4,B015N8JL44,"for me not as moving as Galaxy Express 999, but explores similar themes and is a great watch.",1458259200,,93,4.222222222222222
8734004,3,B015N8JL44,"Received within two days, didn't even click two day shipping.  Very cool.  That said, I bought this movie after remembering a friend had recommended it to me long ago.  I felt it might be a good movie to feed my awakening spiritual self.  Well...I'll be honest. The concept is good...and at some points it's really well executed.  The ending was sad, but I kind of expected it.  And for the majority of it, I was quite restless.  At least a half of the film was Giovanni either sighing, or running from his house, to the milkman, to the square, and back to his house..etc  I was really hoping there would be more characters/situations that feed the underlying message, I was hoping to 'feel' more from this movie than I did.",1458086400,6,724,4.515384615384615
8734005,3,B015N8JL44,"has  finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""Night On The Galactic Railroad"" released by Eastern Star.
Based on the children's novel written by Kenji Miyazawa, ""Night On The Galactic Railroad"" is one of those rarity of animes - a Christian allegory similiar to ""Pilgrim's Progress.""
Giovanni is a young kitten[boy] who is struggling with life.  His father has yet to return from a fishing expedition, and he must work as a pritner's devil after school in order to earn money to buy his sick mother food.  He must also deal with bullying classmates who take every opportunity to mock him.
Late for attending the Festival of Stars, Giovanni hopes to be able to spend time with Campanella - his only friend.
Yet Giovanni flees the festival when mocked about his missing father.  He races away from the town square where the festival is being held; and up a hill where he sees the full glory of the Milky Way unfolding above him.  A train then arrives and he climbs aboard; finding much to his delighted surprise, Campanella is on the train that is taking them to various destinations throughout time and space.
""Night On The Galactic Railroad"" deals with how the loss of a family member and the loss of a freind can impact a young child's life.  It is interesting to note the ""Night On The Galactic Railroad"" delves into multiple universes and multiple concepts of what Heaven is.
Yet, it is not an easy movie to watch.  Jeff H., who is Lutheran, did not like the different types of Heaven that was potrayed in ""Night On The Galactic Railroad.""  If you're going to be offened by a non-traditional idea of Heaven, do not watch this anime.  Jeff H. soldiered through it because he had me [the Conservative Jew] to explain the Christian Symbolism that he didn't understand.  The Christianity in this anime is almost similiar to that of Mormonism - which some Christians might not understand having not taking the time to learn about Mormonism.  [Thanks Elder Dalahanse and Elder Butler.]
Giovanni is forced by his journey to grow up and to begin to make adult choices.  He does get to do the one thing that so many of us never really get the chance to.  He gets to say goodbye.
Still, ""Night On The Galactic Railroad"" isn't easy to watch.  It's a bit unnerving and unsettling.  It looses its mystery and sense of wonder once you figure out what the train really is.
Three Stars.
Recommended Only If You're Intrigued By The Concept of A Christian Anime Allegory.",1456617600,2,2455,4.663573085846868
8734006,4,B015N8JL44,"I am glad to have gotten a hold of the Blu Ray remaster of this movie!  I had a copy of an older VHS copy, and the video quality of the remastered Blu Ray is great!  I left off 1-star, as the commentary did not really add any value to the package. . .",1455753600,2,251,3.6296296296296298
8734007,1,B015N8JL44,"Did I get to watch the same movie as these other people? YIKES! I've suffered through my share of psychological / philosophical / existential anime, including Evangelion and Rah-Xephon, but this one tips the scales as totally un-explainable. I could probably understand it if I had 30+ years to research theology, imagery, and a few other ancient tomes, but who has the time? This is anime and shouldn't be so complex that only the creator understands what's going on. If you really have to see it, borrow, rent, or use PayPerView. This one definitely will NOT stay in my vast collection of anime.",1455148800,2,597,4.805825242718447
8734008,5,B015N8JL44,"Growing up in the 1980's Night in the Galactic Railroad was one of those Japanese animated films that would pop up in Comics Scnene magazine or fan discussions but I never had the chance to see. When it was released on DVD in the 2000s by Central Park Media I again missed my opportunity to catch this film. Finally, I made it a priority when Discotek Media released this to pick up this film.

The movie is based in the Book by Kenji Miyazawa which follows the nighttime journey of two friends Giovanni and Campanella who travel on the aptly titled Galactic Railroad. The film may seem similar to other fans to Galaxy Express 999 with the setting of the galactic train and the various stops along the way. This film however is not a space opera but more a metaphor for life, experiences and explores religious ideas. The film is never preachy but instead quietly builds its thoughts on the human experience - beauty, pain, and loss.

Night on the galactic railroad is not a feel good movie but it's not a downer either. It is dreamlike and should be appreciated as such.",1449964800,19,1071,4.515463917525773
