3038484,3,B000Z8H0YG,"This is certainly a clever undertaking. And, for all the good in its cleverness, it might also be its own worst enemy.

As others have noted, the story concerns a particular incident that takes 10 minutes to play out. The catch is that we see the same 10 minutes from the perspective of all the various players involved.

For the most part it works well. Questions that arise early on get answered in the successive chapters. Where it falters is at the very end. The final scene caught me by surprise, and I couldn't quite believe it was over. It felt very abrupt and unsatisfying. There is a bit of irony in the ending that would have worked better with a more conventional approach to the structuring.

That being said, this is still enjoyable. The performances range from so-so to decent. There weren't any that struck me as being stand-out. The production values were good enough and did little to distract from the proceedings.

If you're looking for a light night out with a bit of the brain teaser thrown in this will suffice. If you need a bit more meat on the bone you might ant to look someplace else.",1305158400,,1111,4.512437810945274
3038485,5,B000Z8H0YG,"Nicely told story of the same ten minutes as seen from several different points of view.  Good twist toward the end.  I don't watch many independent movies, but I'm glad I saw this one.  It's one to keep for your collection--definitely worth watching again and again.

3038486,5,B000Z8H0YG,"I saw this film a couple of years ago when it was making the festival circuit. I was taken in by it's deceptively simple premise. It is a wild, edgy ride (although extreme violence, sex, and nudity make this a film for mature audiences). This film deserves a look by by anyone who enjoys a solid, noir experience.",1238457600,2,313,4.413793103448276
3038487,5,B000Z8H0YG,"Don't believe the nay-sayers below.  Or rather, take them with a grain of salt.  This is not a film for everyone.  It's dark, it doesn't have happy endings, it's got nefarious characters, an unusual structure, it's wildly vulgar and decidely different from any other film you'll see.  It's a LOVE IT or HATE IT kinda movie, as the reviews on this page indicate.

That said, I LOVED it.  It's challenging and unique, hilariously nasty in spots and thoroughly intriguing.  It does suffer from some of the trappings of it's lower budget, including performances that are more servicable than spectacular (the menacing Mr. Duke aside - he was AMAZING).  But the story, the structure (almost everything takes place within a ten-minute span), the twists kept me absolutely GLUED to the screen.  I rented, watched, and as soon as it was over I ran to my computer and bought it.  It was an amazing surprise to find a film this good from one of the lesser titles available.

The extras on the disc are pretty decent as well, especially the cast commentary track, which is almost as unique and entertaining as the movie itself.  I highly recommend this to those who like films that differ from the norm - or at least dig thrillers like MEMENTO that push the envelope!",1222992000,,1256,4.7110091743119265
3038488,1,B000Z8H0YG,"I can't stress enough how bad this ""film"" is and I use the word film loosely as it may just as likely be a high school production taped by the school mascot and written by the lunch lady.
Seeing this film on the shelf of your local video store you may be duped into believing that the starring actor in the film is Morgan Freeman...I assure you it is not. But the makers of this tripe used some very dubious techniques for making you think just that. The cover art certainly looks like Morgan Freeman...there's a review in the top left hand corner on the front that says Freeman in bold letters right above his picture.
If I were Morgan Freeman I would look into this.
The premise of the film was actually the only redeeming quality and so much could have been done with it. Nothing was.
As for violence...well let me tell you about it. Two men are shot in the head, it's ok you don't see any blood as everyone knows bullet wounds to the head don't bleed. Umm...there's a scene where a man smacks his wife around a bit. And the opening scene where you see blood spatter but no actual victim. That sums up the movies violence so if that's what you're signing on for then you will be disappointed. The violence is unintentionally comical.
Ok so that other male favorite movie staple...sex. O boys you're gonna love this...the one sex scene has the woman saying things like ""buckets of maggots...someone puking in your open mouth...puppies with their heads cut off."" And the other ""sex"" scene...is man on man action...replete with a man off camera talking ""with his mouth full"".
Again if you think that arousing by all means have at it.
Not a single actor was notable. Not that they had any sort of script to work with as the writing was even worse than the acting. I mean really...at one point a man tells his wife...""it's ok honey, we never have to speak of it again...it'll be like it never happened"" in regards to what can only be construed as her rape. The woman smiles and all is well.
I can only wish it were that simple otherwise I would apply his sage advice to watching this film. Unfortunately, I think I need a long hot shower and a couple of drinks to scrub myself clean of this wretched wanna-be movie.

On a side note..as of this writing there are 5 reviews for this film...I inspected the 3 rave reviews...they are the ONLY item on the reviewers page. Sounds to me like the makers of this film are trying to drum up some business by padding the ballot box.",1190592000,7,2469,4.4144736842105265
3038489,5,B000Z8H0YG,"Clever, quirky characters, and excellent acting.  Full of sex and violence--not for the easily offended--but delivered with panache, and always in service to the plot.  Really funny too... I loved all of the dark comedic moments.  An excellent first-effort by screenwriter Paul Osborne.  Can't wait to see what's next.",1189641600,7,318,5.428571428571429
3038490,1,B000Z8H0YG,"Reviews in various places mention poor acting, but I disliked the writing even more.  The ignorance and lack of creativity demonstrated in the movie's title should have kept me away, unnecessarily abbreviating the word until (like the fast food marketing idiots of MacDonald's and Taco Bell) rather than using the word till.  A waste of time for an unsatisfying conclusion, this movie isn't even worth renting.",1189296000,5,410,5.196969696969697
3038491,5,B000Z8H0YG,"I give this movie five stars for two reasons:

1. It's an intelligent movie where nothing is predictable.  Even one of the climatic execution scenes took me by surprise.

2. It has lots of really good sexy scenes.  Some of the sex scenes were steamy hot, and some of them were funny.

But most of all, the DVD is filled with a lot of extra stuff.  You could see that the people behind this film went that extra step every step of the way.  I can't wait to see what they come up with next.",1186099200,7,488,4.073684210526316
3038492,5,B000Z8H0YG,"Saw this one during it's brief theatrical run and was BLOWN AWAY!  TEN 'TIL NOON is a highly original modern film noir with a terrific structural gimmick - the entire film takes place in a ten minute time span, between 11:50 and noon.  Each time the clock strikes noon, the film rewinds and places us in the point of view of a different character.  What we end up with is an incredibly layered web, with each new segment completely turning the story on it's head.  The result is invigorating.  I've never seen anything quite like it.

TEN 'TIL NOON also has the requisite thriller elements, all in fine form - the femme fatales, the hitmen, the double-crosses, sex and violence galore.  But the unique story structure puts it over the edge into great filmmaking.  This is a fantastic, highly original indie film that demonstrates there are still new ways to tell a story.

So glad this is FINALLY coming to DVD!!!  It bears many, many viewings.",1186099200,8,944,4.632530120481928

It was clever with an interesting premise and mostly good acting. There was a lot of sex, some violence. I can deal with that. But it was just so unpleasant. Unlikable people doing despicable things for what seemed like a very long runtime. I had to turn the sound down a couple of times so my neighbors wouldn't think I was watching sado-porn.

8234983,4,B000Z8H0YG,"The film """"Ten Til Noon"" was brought to my attention from viewing ""Official Rejection."" This was the film that was shuffled from festival to festival. The narrative is of ten minutes before a ""Hit"" from different character perspectives. The sound track was effective enough for me to feel fear and I did not enjoy the movie as a recreational piece due to the combination for the soundtrack and the narrative, it was a plethora of the elements within human nature that I avoid-Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy & Pride. These are the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" which manifested and captured the tone of the film.  But man, it was very well made. The dialogue, camera work & lack of CG was impressive. I toy with short music video's but to create a film has to be a labor of love. Troma releases films made with camcorders and 8mm film and these films have a home made quality which is funny to see but not necessarily . I suggest acquiring the film ""Official Rejection"" and then view ""Ten Til Noon."" I was surprised at the professionalism even though I don't enjoy films about greed and murder. I think a film maker creating a Noir film needs some comedy which was missing here. Craig Barr.",1329091200,2,1190,4.586854460093897
