688439,4,630362572X,When I first saw Godzilla vs. King Kong I was amazed. It had good acting and even a bunch of humor. King Kong didn't look the best but that's because it was a guy in a suit and not stop-motion. A highly enjoyable film but not  a conclusive ending.,928540800,,247,4.040816326530612
688440,3,630362572X,"One of the most popular of the original godzilla films in its home country, this is a enjoyable but silly film. In part it is a satire of the genre, but whatever the film was trying to do is forgotten as soon as Kong  comes on screen. Effects supervisor Tsuburya (not the correct  spelling,sorry)created many fine effects in his life,but this was not one  of them. He managed to create one of the most god awful monsters in film  history! A hysterical shaggy ape, worse than any seen in the most slipshod  hollywood serials. Sadly, he did no better when he returned to Kong a few  years later with King Kong Escapes. Still, the movie IS enjoyable, with a  sort of all star wrestling final battle. However,other films in the series  are better. see the original film, Godzilla vs the Thing, Destroy all  monsters or any of the new series from Biolante through Destroyer  (1989-1995)",925171200,4,881,4.625806451612903
688614,5,630362572X,This is the original King Kong versus Godzilla there will be a new one coming out around 2019 but I know it's not going to be better than this one. I remember seeing this when I was about nine years old and I fell in love with it immediately. Two of my favorite monsters fighting in one movie? How do you beat that? The answer is you don't. It is a rumor that there are two versions to this movie in the American version King Kong wins and he has seen swimming away in the Japanese version Godzilla wins and he is seen swimming away. So the fight is a tie. But we all know if this really happened Godzilla Wilburn King Kong up with his Atomic nuclear fire breath. this is one movie you have to own.,1508976000,,698,4.065217391304348

688766,5,630362572X,"It is a 1962 movie.  Its image  quality is limited by that era's technology.  And, it is a Toho kaiju movie.  Monsters are men in poorly developed costumes,  and  its masks are  as unexpressive as weird looking. And the scenarios are miniatures in which cars, trucks and helicopters are obviously  toys !!  And,  despite of all those facts,  it is a TOTAL CLASSIC !!!  Kong x Godzilla,  the rather long fight sequence,  the  overacting drama expressions of the actors,  the UN  scientist specialist in .. monsters!!!  The native's song and dance ... the native's Chief ...  Japanese actors painted in black  to perform the natives ... everything here is great!  They took it all  in a so serious way, and at the same time,  it is all so naive...  Looks like perfection,  for a kaiju movie.  Long live  the poor costumes and miniatures,  I am so done with CGI movies,  technically perfect but cold as stone.",1492041600,,906,4.628205128205129

688768,5,630362572X,To start I have most of the Godzilla movies on DVD. This one is an American adaptation to the Japanese version. You can tell by the editing with the American actors and dialog. For some reason I never thought about buying this one but I'm glad I did. Entertaining watching King Kong fight Godzilla. I remember this movie when I was a kid. I got a chuckle though when they had everyone light up a cigarette as a friendly gesture to get to know the natives on a primitive  island.

688860,3,630362572X,"Godzilla's third outing pits him against King Kong! The story begins with Godzilla escaping from his icy prison of the previous film to again threaten Tokyo. Toho borrows heavily from the original Kong films, with scientists on an expedition there discovering the massive gorilla by accident and then having to kidnap him from the natives in order to use him against Godzilla. Like most adaptations of King Kong, The portrayal of Kong's island is dated, at best, with Japanese actors in blackface and an uncomfortable colonial attitude (the Japanese explorers giving cigarettes to a child would never make it past a censor today). This DVD only has the English-dubbed American cut of the film, which alters the story from the original. Unfortunately, there is no standalone DVD of this film that has the original Japanese cut. Additionally, the video quality is reminiscent of lower-quality VHS copies from the late-1980s/early-1990s.",1469923200,4,934,5.275167785234899

689083,5,630362572X,"I remember how excited I was when Famous Monsters of Filmland first printed pictures of this film prior to it's release in America in the summer of 1963.  I could  barely contain myself waiting for it to come to a theater near me.  Unfortunately,  it never did make it to my hometown, or at least my parents chose not to tell me if was showing in our area, probably wanting to spare themselves the ordeal of sitting through another dumb monster show with me!
Then this wonderful DVD presentation was made available and I snapped it up.  Ironically,  now MY kids dreaded sitting through another dumb monster show with dad!  This is the ultimate goofball Godzilla movie, from the serio-science gobbledygook from the UN headquarters to the Japanese sidekick Taco  (is that actually a name in Japan? ) complaining that his corns always hurt when he is near monsters, to the (hot) island mom and her small child menaced by the giant octopus,  to the ad company president shouting ""banzai""  while being  dropped onto the deck of the ship bringing Kong to Japan, there is just a great, good natured feeling about the whole show. As the sixties progressed,  the series became more and more juvenile but this one struck just the right balance of humor and special effects, with the monsters played straight for the most part.  For baby boomer Godzilla fans, this is a must have for your collection.",1463011200,,1389,4.713692946058091

689090,4,630362572X,"Another classic favorite from early childhood. Again - let's not 'analyze' this to death. Just kick back and accept it for what it is: Two classic monsters fighting each other. Truly a moment when Dr. Serizawa (""Godzilla"" 2014) would utter the phrase ""Let them fight!""",1454198400,,268,4.977777777777778
689091,3,630362572X,"One would imagine that a prestige studio that owns the original negative would provide better image quality for this over priced 30th Anniversary edition.  As it stands, that visual quality varies throughout the film [taking into account that blu ray technology is naturally not flattering to some of the process shots employed herein.]

On the bright side, the sequences on Kong's island are sharp with colors that are richly saturated.  One can fully appreciate the beautiful matte paintings that comprise much of the scenery.  Later, we are treated to details of cartoon-animated soldiers scurrying around on sleeping Kong's torso being prepared for the famous airlift.  On the down side, some of the nocturnal scenes involving of Kong in Japan look lousy, with light patterns flaring in backgrounds where there should be solid tonal values.

In spite of my quibbling over quality control, it's still great to finally see this childhood favorite in it's correct aspect ratio, with the original excellent musical score included [U.S. release used cues form earlier Universal monster movies], and to finally hear the real voices of the actors [But unfortunately with NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES, though that part I can live with.]

689485,4,630362572X,"Going back to when I was a kid, I loved these Godzilla movies.  I found it at Walmart in the discount bin/barrel for 5 bucks. You know, that barrel they toss all the crummy movies in?  Anyway, what a gem from when I was little. I never saw it in the theater, as it came out right around when I was born. So as kids, we always watched it on TV in the late 60's or early 70's. I think this was the first time I have seen in it's true widescreen glory, which was great.  On TV back then, of course, one could only watch the chopped up, or pan and scan version. As an adult however, I can't quite give it 5 stars.  Like others have pointed out, it's so bad that it is good.  No acting exists...it's just people that have no emotions that seem to simply read their lines in a generic way like robots.  All the man made things are clearly toys or models, which is funny because many of the scenes they could have used real trains, trucks, tanks etc. etc. because the monsters were not even in those scenes or takes (maybe a budget thing)?.  Still an enjoyable romp from when I was very young.  As far as ""going back in time"" and watching these old Japanese movies as an adult now, I think Son of Godzilla and War of the Gargantuas are more entertaining/funny. But I must admit that WWE like brawl between Godzilla and Kong at the end is as hilarious as I recall and remember it!",1423699200,,1372,4.131578947368421

689583,4,630362572X,"Most people talk about how Ghidrah: The Three Headed Monster was the first movie in the Godzilla franchise to incorporate child-friendly humor. However King Kong vs. Godzilla is when it began to lean more towards the cheesy side.

Plot:
While working for a rich industrialist, a group of employees stumble upon Faro Island. There they encounter Kong: The Eighth Wonder of the World. They bring the beast back to Japan. Meanwhile a submersible has collided into an ice glacier, freeing Godzilla once again. Now the two legendary beasts must fight for the movie's sake.

Review:
It's fun in a good hearted nature sort of way. No unnecessary violence or blood-shed, probable profanity that is quite tame and just cheesiness galore. Godzilla's rubber suit looks awesome but King Kong's looks pretty, uh.... Fake. I get it though, it isn't supposed to look real but I couldn't stand by and watch a famous monster's face turn into a Paper-Mache-like rubber fest. The battles are the highlight of the movie however and I truly enjoyed the characters making this a step above Godzilla Raids Again.

Score:
I really enjoyed the energetic vibe I got from when the natives sing which in turn consists of most of the music in this flick.

Cinematography/Atmosphere:
It's lusher, especially now that the two monsters are in color for the first time. There's just something about it that gives of a vivid vibe of colorful scenery. I dug it.

Bottom Line:

690284,4,630362572X,"King Kong VS Godzilla! Who can resist such a title? I have a deep fondness for this film as it was probably the first Godzilla film I saw in a theater as a kid. Both Kong and Godzilla's first color outing is a mish mash ( U S version) of U.S. added scenes and mumbo jumbo, but it is entertaining.

The two meet briefly about half way through the film and then we get to the battle royal, the finale which is laughable but strangely engaging. I guess because it brings back such good memories.

If you like these types of films and can forget the contrivances that completely disregard the original King Kong folklore in the fact that he is only 30-40 feet tall and now in this film he is made to be over 400 feet tall so he can battle the G Man and lets not forget that lightning makes him stronger and he is able to deliver electric charges through his hands to help counter Godzilla's radioactive breath. Ha-ha! It's just a hoot to watch these two doing martial arts moves and destroying toy cities. ..isn't that why we watch these films anyway?

I'm reviewing the original release, but a new Blu Ray is coming. The DVD I have looks fine and is in widescreen. I've heard the Blu Ray hasn't been restored so I doubt it will be worth the upgrade. If it included the Japanese version of the film too, then I'd buy it as soon as it came out.",1392508800,,1339,4.22265625
690285,5,630362572X,"I was pretty excited to hear this Sixties Toho classic, one of the most successful entries in the franchise, was coming to Blu-ray this April (2014).  Sadly, however, it and the Blu-ray of Toho's KING KONG ESCAPES are being sold separately.  There is no reason for these two films to not be packaged together.  Actually, when you consider the storage capacity of Blu-ray, there's no reason for them not to be on the same disc.  Overall, it seems like a mercenary marketing move to cash in on the new theatrical Godzilla film coming our way.  (It was Peter Jackson's KING KONG remake that spurred the two Toho Kongs even getting a DVD release.)  Universal should take a cue from Twilight Time, which is releasing Gerry Anderson's THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO and THUNDERBIRD 6 as a double feature Blu-ray on May 13.

On a more positive note, this was the first Godzilla film in color, and was the template for most of the Godzilla films of the Sixties and Seventies, pitting giant behemoths against each other with a sense of fun rarely found in films today.  For those who remember seeing this on the big screen, or on the small screen after school or on the late show, it's time to revisit these two old friends again.",1391472000,3,1210,4.595348837209302

I was expecting to see an intro on where Godzilla or King Kong came from but was surprised with a subtle piano song and a beautiful view of a sunset over a lake. I didn't mind. I knew these type of movies usually build up to something like a huge battle in the end, so I shrugged it off and kept watching. Now, I usually don't like to talk about my life that much but as soon as I popped this bad boy in the DVD player my wife ran out to the living room. This surprised me, as I don't get spend too much quality time with her these days. Long story short, I didn't finish seeing it.

690483,5,630362572X,"I ordered this for my son a while ago, and he loves it!  Shipping was faster than he expected and it arrived in excellent condition.  This is the 3rd film in both franchises and both the first time in color.

When He first saw it he thought it was a remake because of the 1985 Godzilla suit and the 1976 King Kong suit on the cover, but found out that it was the same movie as before.  Godzilla looks better than Godzilla Raids Again suit.  Kong on the other hand, looked ridiculously weird.  This is an improvement from the 2nd films of the franchises too.  He has only seen G.R.A. a few times and hasn't seen Son of Kong straight through yet.  A remake is needed for technology reasons, and a release of the Japanese version would be great as well.  This is one of my son's favorite Godzilla movies ever because he's a fan of both Godzilla and King Kong.

After more than 10 years, he's got almost all of the Godzilla movies.

This is a movie not to be missed if you are a fan of Japanese monster movies.

Definitely recommended!",1378944000,2,1031,4.284974093264249
690484,3,630362572X,"King Kong Vs. Godzilla is one hour and thirty minutes and was released in theaters in the United States on June 17, 1963. The movie begins with a submarine near the North Pole that finds an iceberg with high radiation levels to. As the submarine approaches closer to the iceberg it accidently runs into the iceberg and breaks the iceberg open. Unknowingly to the crew, it has released Godzilla and the monster starts to head to Japan. At the same time Mr. Tako, who looks like a Japanese Groucho Marx, head of Pacific Pharmaceuticals has sent two of his employees to Faro Island to bring back King Kong.  The two bring back King Kong to Japan mainly for entertainment purpose, but with Godzilla destroying Japan King Kong is put to work to fight Godzilla. King Kong loses round one due to Godzilla's fire breath, no breath mints back then. But in the second match it is a slam bang WWF match due to King Kong strength being enhanced my an electrical storm. Both monsters fall into the sea and only King Kong emerges and swim home. The movie leads you wondering if Godzilla survived for another movie.

Some facts about this movie are there was only one original ended. Spacemen claimed in the sixties that there was only two endings. King Kong was more popular in Japan then Godzilla so it was only right that the win should go to King Kong. This was the first color film for the two monsters and the first time either were shot in wide screen. Finally the United States version is seven minutes shorter than the Japanese version. King Kong Vs. Godzilla is an okay movie and gets a C+.

This is the American version produced by Universal (Kong's owners) and has attached some American actors scenes to the film, but it's not as jarring as one might expect. The story has a trio of good guys, a less-than-useful ingenue, a greedy, but well-meaning entrepreneur, a giant octopus (or a garbage bag that looks remarkably NOT like an octopus), and two kaiju in a country that ain't big enough fer both of 'em--yeah, they're gonna fight. And it goes two big rounds with lots of mayhem in-between. Godzilla starts becoming a little anthropomorphic here, displaying a few sadistic tendencies and a mean sense of humor.
The film quality is Aces, every detail about right. If there were any flaws, the film's quality is so good, you can really figure out which monsters are guys in suits, and which ones are puppets.",1371340800,2,1026,4.868571428571428

King Kong looks like a guy in a bad gorilla suite, but the actor does a good job with his mannerisms.

You feel bad for the big guy when he gets confused with how to fight a monster who is a walking flamethrower.

690723,3,630362572X,"The 1960s. Humankind was still reeling from the emotional horrors of World War II and coming to grips with the life in the Atomic Age, when annihilation lurked beneath everyday's headlines. In the depth of this existentialist despair, even theologians were proclaiming the Death of God. It was this philosophical catastrophe that Toho Studios addressed in ""King Kong Versus Godzilla.""  Brilliantly conceiving humanity's internal conflict as two famous pop culture icons as the avatars of of history's worst impulses and darkest fears, they---

Oh, who am I kidding? ""King Kong Versus Godzilla"" is exactly what the title says, a low-brow high-concept monster movie calculated to cash in on the proven box office appeal of King Kong, the Ur-movie monster, and Godzilla, who by 1962 had achieved critical cred and an international following, and now was ready to make the move by his creators from pointed statement about nuclear warfare to a cartoonish figure with no more historical baggage than Captain Crunch. Who wouldn't buy a ticket to see these two giants slug it out over Tokyo and Mount Fuji like two aging drag queens fighting over an autographed copy of ""Mommie Dearest"" in a Village vintage thrift shop?

This film was third in the series, and, like ""Goldfinger,"" the third installment in the James Bond series, ""King Kong Versus Godzilla"" solidified Godzilla's status as an international box office sensation that would last for decades. (Even if it meant receiving second billing in an entry in his own series). This was also the first Godzilla movie to be filmed in color and in widescreen. Unfortunately,at least for Western audiences,  the originality pretty much ended there. [[ASIN:B000P24FAE King Kong vs. Godzilla] is the version that was released in the American audience, jettisoning the original Japanese version, which satirized television journalism.  This version does work in a few sly jabs at the world of advertising,as Kong is kidnapped (ape-napped?] by a Japanese pharmaceutical company, apparently planning to use Kong for promotional purposes (a plot point later picked up in the 1976 King Kong remake). A good third of the movie is devoted to  international news coverage of the ""crisis,""  and here the production values are nearly at Ed Wood levels. In my favorite howler, a ""dinosaur expert"" uses a children's picture book [a book that sat on the shelf of every self-respecting dinosaur-loving kid in the 1960s]  on dinosaurs to explain Godzilla to the international viewing audience.,

This DVD version offers virtually no extra features, and the sound and picture quality is only slightly better, if better at all, than what you probably remember seeing on your color TV screen when you first saw this movie on your local TV station's ""Creature Feature"".  But somehow that only adds to the movie's charm. And let's face it, no body comes to a movie like  ""KIng Kong Versus Godzilla"" for the art. Fans will buy because owning it is like recapturing a piece of our childhood, when a large bowl of Jiffy Pop popcorn, a soda so large it would give Mayor Bloomberg nightmares, and a cheesy Japanese monster movie imprinting itself on our incredulous eyeballs was about as good as life could get.

690725,4,630362572X,"Godzilla faces off against his greatest foe in KING KONG VS GODZILLA: Japanese consumerism! The Pacific Pharmaceutical company captures Kong to exploit the giant ape in a televised marketing campaign, while a nuclear submarine mistakenly unleashes Godzilla from his icy tomb. The world's two greatest monsters collide in an epic battle over Japan! Originally conceived as a new King Kong vehicle entitled KING KONG VS FRANKENSTEIN, Godzilla's third outing is one of the best in the series, but also the film that has suffered from the most ruthless and unnecessary re-editing in America. In its original context, it is a poignant and playful strike against the emerging post-war commercialism that consumed Japan in the early 1960's, filled with biting, cynical humor that likely would have escaped American audiences. Mr. Tako (Ichir Arishima) and his crew provide plenty of hilarious comic relief as their new 'star' goes on a rampage through Tokyo, ending at the foot of the film's most impressive miniature: Atami Castle. Time and budgetary constraints would eliminate the possibility for stop-motion animation, and force special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya to shoot the monsters in frame using Toho's trademarked brand of suitimation instead (though a few shots can still be found that used the stop-motion process). The result is a rather shabby Kong costume with mangy fur and little facial articulation. On the other hand, the destruction caused by each of the giants is top-rate, as are their many battles, although we see the earliest beginnings of Godzilla's anthropomorphic future. KING KONG VS GODZILLA was the highest grossing film in the series, and also the first Godzilla picture to be shot both in color and in the widescreen TohoScope format. A favorite among fans, KING KONG VS GODZILLA has had an enduring legacy in Kaiju cinema.

690813,5,630362572X,"I saw this a long time ago on television, and I've never looked back. So many people say this is the dumbest Toho monster movie, and in a lot of ways it is. The best part (or worst, depending on your point of view) is the King Kong suit in this movie. To me, it's always been a little sinister-looking, reminding me of Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera makeup in that it's a little grotesque, but foolish. I love it. I don't like the pointy, ""bird-faced+ Godzilla suit, he seems a little too fat and ponderous. The look of Godzilla would improve drastically in the next film, ""Godzilla vs. The Thing.""
Many people comment on the overt humor in this film, and it does have a lot of intentional clownsmanship, but anyone who's seen the original Japanese version knows that the American dub had an astonishing amount of humor cut out. I like both versions equally well; King Kong vs. Godzilla will always have a featured spot in my collection.

In the last year I've begun a quest on collecting old B-list sci-fi and horror movies to open my own cult cinema, and collecting the Toho monster movies has been top priority. So when I purchased this DVD my thoughts were ""Awesome, now I can see the original japanese dialoge and compare to the american version.
And low, what I recieved was just the American version...
Now thats not to say this is a bad thing, but for me, any fan who's collecting these classic Toho movies wants ones with the original japanese dailoge track and commentary from guys like Classic Media have been doing for other Godzilla re-releases. Now granted this doesn't change the reality that I finally have been reunited with essentially the movie I grew up on, down to the packaging. But the dubbing...hurts to listen to as an adult.
Now most of these reviews give a synopsis of what the movie is about, but lets face it, if you can read the cover you know what the movie is about. Its not like KKvsGZA is about a deformed Lobster named Jones who lives on the moon.
This is a very basic DVD. No special features, subs available for English, French and Spanish only, no other language tracks, just the basic Movie, scene selection and languages.
The movie itself is enjoyable, although I'm left wanting more from DVD itself. The 3rd of the Godzilla franchise, 1st to introduce the two kings of the monsters in Color, 1st joint made film between Japan and USA, and its just a fun monster movie for anyone of any age. I'm hoping that Toho will release this with Classic Media, but perhaps Universal is clenching this movie pretty tightly. Time will only tell if future DVDs will give us fans all we want out of the movie, but until then we can still enjoy this classic.

To see my two all-time favorite monsters up there on the big screen duking it out was almost too cool for words (okay, I admit the Kong suit was pretty cheesy-looking, but do you think the kid in me cared about that?  This was the Battle of the Behemoths!).  My local theater back then was just a single screen movie house, and would show the same film twice in one evening - an early show and a later show.  For this film I stayed for both showings (they used to let you do that back then, or if they didn't, I don't recall ever being caught).

For many years I reveled in the memory of that gloriously insane monster mash, catching the movie on TV whenever it would pop up, and of course, snapping up VHS and (later) DVD copies of it when the home entertainment revolution came about.  Being a die-hard G fan, I eventually collected the entire movie series, not to mention a good many Godzilla toys and other mechandise/memorabilia.

I know a great many Godzilla fans will no doubt bash me for this, but in many ways, King Kong vs Godzilla IS my all-time favorie Godzilla film!  I realize that this is probably due to the inner child still residing inside me, but this is the one film out of my entire collection that I have watched more times than I can count.  The one that makes me feel good, gives me silly laughs, and gives me an almost overwhelming sense of nostalgia.  And yes, it is the ""butchered"" American version of the film to which I'm referring, for it's the one I grew up with.  Somehow in its own weird, nonsensical way, it maintains a cohesive plotline without deviating much into useless narrative or subplot terrotory, as so many Godzilla movies are prone to do.  Of course, I also own a copy of the uncut Japanese version (what sort of Godzilla fan would I be if I didn't?), and while I admit that it probably is  a better film than the American version, it's not the one I return to again and again.  There are many other great films in the series, as well as some not-so-great, and even a few that are decidedly painful to watch.  But even the great ones do not find their way into my DVD player as frequently as this version of KKVG.

There are tons of unforgettable bits in this film.  UN Reporter Eric Carter.  The Amercian submarine approaching the iceberg.  Godzilla emerging from the iceberg.  Godzilla attacking the Arctic military base. The American scientist attempting to identify Godzilla out of a kid's book on dinosaurs (I HAD that book as a kid!).  The octopus attack.  Kong's first appearance.  Kong's raft being blown to bits.  Kong rising from the ocean. Kong and Godzilla's first meeting.  Kong approaching Tokyo.  The final smackdown/battle.  Cheesy costumes! Bad dubbing!  No boring subplots!  Native drums!  Hand puppets!  A guy called Taco!  This movie has it all...

This DVD offers a pretty decent widescreen transfer of a terrific movie, but very little else.  Chapter selections, English subtitles, and a couple of different spoken languages, though NOT Japanese. In all, a pretty bare bones DVD, but still essential to any Godzilla collection (provided you're not a hater of the Americanized version) if only for its widesceen aspect ratio.  Basically, light years ahead of the earlier Goodtimes pan & scan effort for that reason alone.

To me, if ever there was a film that defines the term ""popcorn movie"" this would have to be it.  I know there are many out there who would disagree, and that's fine.  I'm sure everyone has their own favorite Godzilla movie, and this just happens to be mine.  That is, after all, only my humble opinion.  But after more than a half century of being a Godzilla fan, that's still the opinion by which I stand.  I absolutely love this movie.

Glaringly reworked for western audiences, the plot doesn't make an awful lot of sense. Dry, boring news segments savor more screen time than anyone, while an over-ambitious plot attempts to retell both monsters' origins on the cheap and fails spectacularly. The effects work is a laughingstock; an abundance of blatant toy miniatures barely manage to keep themselves upright, and the scale of both creatures varies wildly from one scene to the next. Kong's costume (with its sporadically stretching forearms) is the creme de la creme, a creation so shoddy it would have been laughed off the set of an Ed Wood movie.

691285,3,630362572X,"One of the all-time classic monster duels comes to DVD--a beautiful print presented in anamorphic widescreen. Unlike the recent Sony and Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock releases of Toho classics, which include the original Japanese versions, this Universal release offers only the American version produced by John Beck in 1963 (Universal owns the rights, which frees them from having to wrangle with Toho for licensing).

The Americanized version of King Kong vs. Godzilla is a travesty, but a fun one. The original Toho film took a clever tongue-in-cheek approach, which the American producers managed to decimate with heavy-handed editing and inserting new scenes featuring Michael Keith as a news reporter and Harry Holcombe as a scientist. To U.S. audiences, the Japanese actors come off as buffoons, whereas in the original, they're playing nudge-nudge, wink-wink with viewers--especially Ichiro Arishima as the irrepressible Mr. Tako. One of the most infuriating excisions from the original Japanese version is Akira Ifukube's alternately somber and rousing score; in its place is stock Universal library music, including the main title from The Creature From the Black Lagoon.

Fortunately, most of the monster scenes survive intact. Kong himself resembles a moth-eaten, Raggedy Ape doll, which might rightly insult fans of the original Kong, but most daikaiju aficionados accept it as part of the film's silly charm.

King Kong vs. Godzilla is half of a double-DVD release, the other half being the Toho/Rankin-Bass production King Kong Escapes. Highly recommended for its fine video presentation.",1265500800,2,1601,5.55327868852459

691427,1,630362572X,"I love Godzilla. Let me state that again..I LOVE GODZILLA! I'm a fan of the entire series from ""King of All Monsters"" to ""Final Wars"". I own every film available on DVD, I own the video games, I own quite a few of the soundtracks on CD and I will be the first in line when ""vs. Biollante"", ""vs. Megalon"" and ""1985"" hit DVD and pay whatever is asked just so I can complete my collection. Yes, I can even sit through the Matthew Broderick travesty that bears the name ""Godzilla"".

That being said....

I'm not sure how anyone, fan or non-fan, can enjoy ""King Kong vs. Godzilla""???? This film is so astonishingly awful, it veers way off of the ""So Bad It's Good"" track onto the simply horrible realm at about 20 minutes in. I love bad b-movies, I'll sit back and watch ""Mesa of Lost Women"" or ""Eegah"" all day long, but ""Kong vs Godzilla"" is mind numblingly awful. Where to begin....

1. King Kong does not look like ""King Kong"". This ratty ape suit looks like it's barely holding together, and the nightmarishly barely animated hand-puppet face used for close ups of the giant ape is grade school level F/X at best.

2. While having a strong plot isn't exactly key to a successful Godzilla film, Kong's storyline is so minimal as to not exist. Basically a company has found out these island berries can get you intoxicated, so they want to steal them. Unfortunately they happen to be King Kong's drink of choice as well. So basically the events of the film occur because some Japanese folks and King Kong both want to get high! Godzilla only gets involved because the worlds worst submarine captain doesn't understand that iceburgs don't simply float on top of the water, and that most of the ice is actually below the water's surface, thus ramming his nuclear sub into Godzilla's ice prison.

3. The UN / American footage. I don't know if watching the original Japanese version of this film would help much, but the American version with the narrator/UN report guy is amazingly dull. For some reason there is a space station shown, and some maps, a Japanese correspondant who doesn't know how to wear headphones....and everybody is watching the events unfold on a 10"" color TV screen? The American scientist is awful as well, you have to love when he holds up a small gumball and states that it is the size of Godzilla's brain??? What???

4. The fight scenes are dull. If nothing else you can usually rely on Toho films to provide some decent monster fights in their films...not so much here. Sure Godzilla and Kong meet for a final showdown about 10 minutes before the film ends...but it's just bad...and worse there really isn't a conclusion.

Luckily, Godzilla would go on to much better things after this third entry in the series. I guess as a Godzilla fan I'm happy to have this disk in my collection, I can't imagine I'll pull it out very often (maybe in another 10 years or so?), but as a completist I had to own it.",1264636800,16,2922,4.533206831119545
691428,5,630362572X,"Who can resist that title?! This is another very entertaining entry in the Godzilla series. This is the first Kong film produced by ToHo, but I think King Kong Escapes is a much funnier film. The Kong costumes are quite different in the two films with this Kong looking more evil and the other looking more cute. I'm sure the Rankin & bass influence in ""Escapes"" could be behind that.

This film has plenty of action and some great and hilarious fight scenes. The special effect and miniatures are also some of the better in most cases, but there are some goofy looking effects here and there.(i.e. the plastic wrap on the octopus to make it look wet whenever Kong is holding it.)

There are some inconsistencies in the folk lore of these two titans such as Godzilla and King Kong's size difference and Kong getting stronger with lightning, but who cares?.... this is a battle royal and it is a real hoot once we get to the big brawl!

I give this film 5 stars for its fun factor and because it is full of hysterical action sequences. If you're a fan of Godzilla and these types of films this is a real treat! My review is for the older release that was available in a two pack with King Kong Escapes. I don't know if the newer edition has added anything to warrant buying it as I can not find any info about it. This is usually not a good sign and I suspect it to be the same DVD with a new cover.

There seems to be a misconception that the Japanese version is more sophisticated than this version. Trust me it isn't. It's different, but not better. In fact sometimes it plays off more comical than this version. The Japanese ending is not any different, other than Godzilla gets the closing roar. The ending is a matter of perspective. Kong swam away in victory because he's the hero and had Godzilla on the ropes before they fell into the water. Kong swam away in retreat because he couldn't stay underwater indefinitely like Godzilla can. What many people don't know is there is a third version.

691433,5,630362572X,"GODZILLA VS KING KONG

The year was uh well em well I don't remember but when I was a little kid I remember turning on the TV one afternoon and to my surprise my favorite monster of all time Godzilla was about to come. He was going to do battle with everyone's favorite oversized ape King Kong and I could not have been happier, after all Godzilla was my all time favorite. Naturally Kong had no chance in my mind but I imagined that the battle would be legendary, as a kid I was not disappointed with the film until the ending. Of course I would learn later that a different version of the film, the original version of the film was out there. Of course either way I loved and still do love this film, in my eyes it will forever be a classic regardless of shortcomings on the filmmakers part. To this day when I watch this movie, either version, I still watch it like I was that little kid with awe in my eyes. I do own both versions this the American version on DVD and the original Japanese version on VHS, when I go through all my old VHS tapes I will probably review the original but for now this review will mainly be about this release. This was the third appearance in a film I believe for both monsters and it was the first time they were seen in color and in widescreen.

The film went through a lot of changes before the final product and even cut out the original guy that wanted to make this movie. From what I can gather a guy named Willis O'Brien who did animation on the original Kong film came up with an idea to do a new King Kong feature. His idea would involve a giant Frankenstein's monster going up against Kong, that got no were due to rights for the creature although it went threw name changes with the same concept. Around this time Willis comes into contact with a producer named John Beck who went on to produce the final product. After putting the script out there to studios around the world eventually a production company in Japan called Toho agreed to do the film. Except they wanted to do a Kong film that would pit their monster Godzilla against the famous ape, it was here that Willis was cut out due to Beck doing this behind his back while George Worthing Yates came in as a writer at this point. Once the cast, crew, and locations were ready [for both versions] they went to work.

The movie is really up until one point two completely different stories going on at the same time that come together pretty easily and for this type of film believably. The first is the Kong story that is told by the Japanese as a Mr. Tako played by Ichir Arishima is upset with how everything is turning out with his TV show, so after hearing about Kong from a doctor he decided that the best thing to do is capture the beast and use him for publicity. So off are two of his employees named Sakurai and Kinsaburo to an island where the ape is supposed to be and they are greeted not so friendly like by the natives. The natives of the island it turns out worships Kong and are not happy with these people being here, until they bust out the radio and cigarettes to show the natives. At around the same time all of this is happening a U.S submarine is out in icy waters and comes across something it did not want to, a giant reptile named Godzilla. Of course Godzilla is off to Tokyo and in between Godzilla traveling and stomping right threw the Japanese military, we are back on the island were not only does King Kong appear but he actually gets into it with a giant octopus. After that little ordeal is complete he drinks some stuff and passes out to the soothing music of the natives, and so he is off captured by his publicity hungry captures.

It is some were around here that the two stories started to come together as a plan was hatched to let the monsters go at it by the U.N., things don't work out so well. As Godzilla destroys everything in his path terrorizing the local folk at every turn as were Kong is just making his way towards Godzilla. When these two giants first came together to clash I remember sitting there thinking ""aww man this is going to be legendary"", I was not disappointed as Godzilla gave it to Kong and literally had the King running away. It was right then and there I knew this film was a classic. Of course from that point it is all about Godzilla on the loose and Kong on the run [away from Godzilla], so the humans of the U.N. devise a plan that would put Kong back in the ring with Godzilla [how they got him there I will speak on later]. So the final battle is on and once again Godzilla is whopping up on ""King"" Kong {let it be known that if this was a different film I would be for Kong, but I will go against any one going up against Godzilla} with Kong getting in a shot or two once in a while but nothing that really hurts his opponent. At some point Kong tries some rolling maneuver to get past Godzilla and he knocks him self out after hitting his head on a bolder. Then a miracle happens, an electrical storm happens just long enough to shock Kong and give him the strength to continue, earlier the humans made it public knowledge that electricity was bad for Godzilla but good for Kong [yeah]. It helps for a moment and Kong actually gets in a few seconds of some nice ground and pound Ortiz style, but other then that he still takes more then he gives. Then they hit the water with Godzilla on top, and after a little bit Kong is seen in the distance leaving [in my opinion running again like earlier]. It is here that most of the controversy is talked about, but I assure you there are more differences and some odd things.

Before we get to that I must say that the writing by Bruce Howard and Paul Mason did a decent job with their English rewrite, and the new American director Thomas Montgomery seems to have changed things around a little for the additional scenes added to the American release. Over all for what it is they did good jobs but the original Japanese film is better in my opinion, director Ishir Honda did a good job taking the series in a new direction as did writer Shinichi Sekizawa and producer Tomoyuki Tanaka. But this is the American version and for what it is it is good, loved it growing up as an adult I can now see the flaws but still. All of the actors did decent to good jobs in their respective roles for the most part but you can't always expect Oscar worthy performances all the time. They wanted to change a lot of the comedic aspects of the movie; I say they didn't do a good job because it is still funny in other ways. I have to say that the actors that played Sakurai and Kinsaburo were brilliant and make a wonderful comedic on screen team, there scenes on the island were Kong is worshipped are priceless.

Now on to the odd things I talked about earlier, Godzilla got changed around a little for this film since they wanted him to not look so scary. They chopped off his ears and gave him one less toe, also his fins, body, and head were modified to make him look more like a reptile. Another weird thing is that even though these two were never apparently heard of by these people as soon as they see them they know the creatures by name. Also when was it decided that King Kong could draw power from electricity; I guess that it was a convenience so they could come up with a way for him to even stand a chance. But put that all aside and think about this, how are these two even in the same league. Godzilla is way too big and powerful and awesome to even consider Kong a threat, really think about it. In the Kong films Kong was way bigger then the people of course but he was no were near taller then the buildings, in fact if memory serves me right he had to climb them to get to the top and is taken out by airplanes. Godzilla on the other hand was always taller then the buildings in his films and just knocked them all down, plus he ate plans for breakfast. With that said that brings us to the legendary duel endings, an American and Japanese take each. Depending on who you believe this is either true or false, pick one and go with it one or the other. In the original Japanese version after Kong is seen running away in the back ground we hear Godzilla roar as does Kong when ""the end"" appears. In the American version Kong is the only one heard roaring, what else could that mean. Some people say that this is just a myth and that in the Japanese version was just the two monsters doing a curtain call like final bow, but what does that mean for the American version only Kong is taking a final bow. I like to think that the myth is true and that John Beck wanted Kong to win, and that in the Japanese version Godzilla was the winner. Sure it is very possible that the Japanese filmmakers meant it as a final bow, but that means that Beck wanted American audiences to view Kong as the victor in his version any way. Still it makes more sense in the Japanese version hat Godzilla won, another thing you should think about.

1. Godzilla beats on Kong way more then Kong dishes out

2. Kong is energized by electricity and they fall in the ocean a little later, water and electricity don't mix well

3. When they fall into the ocean it is clearly seen that Godzilla is on top while Kong is on the bottom taking most of the fall.

3. Earlier when Kong realized that he could not defeat Godzilla he turns and runs, now if Godzilla was on top going into the water and was winning the majority of the fight it is more then logical to think Kong is seen fleeing the scene. Add in the end were we hear Godzilla roar and then Kong respond, they did the same thing in the first fight when Kong ran.

Now with all that out of the way I can still say that American version or not Godzilla is off the chains and I love this film to the this day, I know Godzilla won so I still watch it like I was a kid.",1231372800,30,9822,4.213602550478215

691559,3,630362572X,"While the American version of this movie is somewhat entertaining, I realized how much it was butchered and altered when I acquired the Japanese subtitled version, which is wide screen, and hi-fi stereo. Ishiro Honda's original Japanese music score, especially the important ""Godzilla"" theme music was replaced in the American version with stock music from Universal, mostly from ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"". There's no annoying U.N reports, which leads to another inaccuracy. When the helicopter pilot sees Godzilla breaking out of the iceberg, he shouts, ""GODZILLA""! The scene then switches to U.N. reporter Eric Carter stating..""The world is stunned to discover that prehistoric creatures exist in the 20th century""...If that's the case, how did the helicopter pilot even know who Godzilla was? How did anyone know who Godzilla was? In the Japanese version, which, by the way, in the iceberg scene, the pilot gasps..Ahhhh...it's GOJIRA!"" The ""Godzilla"" theme music stars, and the scene switches quickly to the scene where Godzilla is crossing the Bearing Sea, and attacks the military base. Godzilla's previous entrapment in the iceberg is also referenced to by one of the scientists, something to the effect of ""We knew he would not remain frozen in the iceberg forever, even if it took 200 years, we knew he would return to us eventually"". OK, it's not an epic flick like the original ""King Kong"", but it's a fun movie, and the Japanese version moves along a lot better than the American version, and makes more sense, if a movie like this can make any kind of sense! It runs about 10 minutes longer, and there's a little more detail to certain cast members concerning the ""plot"".

691560,4,630362572X,"Where do I begin?

The special effects are very cheaply done, even for 1962, when we already had the stop and go motion technology that made the original KING KONG so famous.  The ape suit for KONG is so bad, it makes the one in the 1976 version look like CGI.  Just watch the scenes where Kong bats his eye lids like some raging queen.  The dubbing is expectedly bad and the performances from the Japanese actors are very campy.

So, it's amazing that given all that, this monster movie has become an irresistable cult classic!  You can't help but feel a shiver of excitement in your spine when you see these two classic movie monsters (cheap suits) clash on screen.

Godzilla quickly best Kong, and Kong fless to think of a better strategy to face such a awesome opponet.

691689,3,630362572X,"Okay, so here it is the American monster king, King Kong versus the king of monsters in Japan, Godzilla, in the super size showdown of all time.

First there are several inherent and serious problems with such a duel.

1. First of all, both monsters were killed in their film debut. Godzilla was resurected but kong was gone with the New York wind.

2. If you go by the originals, King Kong was 50 feet tall. Godzilla was mentioned at being 400 feet tall, later in Godzilla 1985 supposedly he is closer to 200 ft but either way he would merely step on the midget Kong. That wouldn't make for a very exciting match so they fudged things a couple hundred feet and made Kong the same size.

3. Godzilla has radioactive breath. 1 blast from that and the highly flamable Kong would have burned to a crisp.  Okay, so maybe in this film Godzilla's breath isn't so strong and he decides hardly to use it.

4. Godzilla absorbs power from lighting and power lines in the other movies. All of the sudden it is King Kong who does?!

Okay, so it was an attempt to give the big monkey some sort of power other than his own two hands.

5. Godzilla comes from the sea. How the heck do you drown a creature that normally lives underwater until he is disturbed and decides to surface to pummel Tokyo?

Alright, so if you look past all the MINOR problems with this show the end result is some comical entertainment. Bearing in mind the age of this show the fight and effects are pretty decent. They certainly could have done better but I don't think they realized it would be as popular as it turned out.

The final verdict?

Come on, it's a monster flick with guys in suits fighting. You know what to expect. Just watch away and laugh. Though very contradicting to the Godzilla storyline, the questionable ending was probably the best way to do it since Japanese fans would want Godzilla to win and many Americans would want their King Kong to win.  Kind of like the final match of Optimus Prime and Megatron in Transformers, the movie..obviously Prime was more capable of winning a fair fight but you could argue who actually won.

Meanwhile, a TV/pharmasutical company has discovered an island where special berries can be found.  The berries are used to placate a giant ""god.""  Mr. Tako, the CEO of the TV/pharmasutical company sends men to go get the monster, who turns out to be Toho's version of King Kong, a giant ape.  After Kong defeats a giant octopus, he gets drunk on the rare berry juice and passes out.  Tako's men tie Kong up and try to tow him to Japan on a ridiculously large raft.
Meanwhile, Godzilla is kicking (...) in Japan, thwarting most of the military's attempts to stop him.  He is deterred by electrical lines (the original Godzilla wasn't bothered by electicity, but this is the Godzilla from Godzilla Raids Again).
King Kong escapes from his bonds, swims to Japan, and for some reason, heads straight for Godzilla.  Godzilla easily wins round 1, causing Kong to turn tail and flee (as one veiwer states: ""it's like fighting a flame thrower!"").  Godzilla continues to wreak havoc even as Kong storms through Tokyo wreaking havoc of his own.  It is hear that Kong is captured once again (drugged by the berry juice) and then dropped on Godzilla for a second round.
In the second round, Kong is braver, but gets his (...) kicked none the less.  As he lies on the ground, apparently defeated, it is revealed that electricity actually powers him up!  Kong launches a savage attack (round 3) against Godzilla, using his new electro grip.  Soon the electro grip wears off and the two combatants are even, both having had the snot beat out of them.  They then attack full force (round 4) and just as the fight is getting good...Well, I won't reveal who wins in this review.
King Kong Vs Godzilla is a fun film.  The human characters are far more engaging than the monster plot (until the fights at the end of the film).  The humor however, is a bit forced at times (""My corns always hurt when I'm near a monster!"" ""King Kong won't make a monkey out of us!"" and a scene involving the push of a dynamite plunger).  Their are no real outright villains in this picture, only misguided ones (Mr Tako comes to mind: he wants to bring Kong to Tokyo, not realizing how dangerous the notion is).  I liked the military leader; he wasn't gung ho shoot shoot shooot, but calm and collected.  The actor's performance brought about a man thinking things through before coming to rash desisions.
The budget could definately have been expanded.  My feeling is that Toho had no idea that the film would end up being the most successful Godzilla film of all time, so didn't pony up the money needed to make a really great monster film.  If they had, meybe the budget would have been increased a bit.  Never the less, the special effects aren't all bad and all of the action isn't terrible.
King Kong's appearance is fairly poor, but toward the end of the film, during the final fights, this is nearly forgotten in the action.  He is sort of a giant hairy alcoholic who does battle with Godzilla for the shear heck of it (and the scientist at the UN thought Kong had a big brain...).
This is the next to last film in which Godzilla was portrayed as a definate villain in the original series (1954:Godzilla - 1975: Terror of Mechagodzilla).  He is a bit cartoony at times, but his early scenes are excellant (escaping from an ice berg and stomping a military complex.  I love how the tanks attack, but then turn tail and run!  Smart thinking on thgeir part!).
So a poor budget and forced humor hurt this film a bit and oh:  how could I forget?  The film is constantly inturrupted by an American reporter at the UN with his guest, a scientist (who reminds me very much of Peter Graves).  This UN reporter fills the veiweer in on most of the story points in a pretty dumbed down manner, but to his credit, the actor does a fairly good job with his more or less nowhere part.
This film is by no means a 4 (much less a 5) star production, and I am probably being a bit generous by awarding it 3, but darn it, inspite of it's flaws, it's a fun film!",1109980800,,4245,4.4921875

Yes,I admit It has flaws in the origin of King Kong,of him being much larger in this movie,etc.etc. Also him looking cheezy compared to our version. Lets face it folks,the Japanese aren't known for high-tech blockbuster special effects in their movies like the USA.They've done something right though,they seem to be making money hand over fist with Godzilla/King Kong Fans the world over. This is an understatement to say the least. This flick is campy fun for the whole family,even with it's flaws. It doesn't have cussing & nudity,  just a fun movie to watch.

Actually the only sloppy dialog is in the scenes on the sub and in the Chinook helicopter, where some Americans get their voices overdubbed! Fill in your own dialog translations for the little ones a'la MST3K if you feel the need; my granddaughters aged 5 & 6 followed the plot perfectly with just a few imbellishments from Gramps.

691821,4,630362572X,"""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" is the 3rd installment of the Godzilla series, and the first Godzilla film to be shown in color. The film was produced 7 years after ""Gojira No Gyakushu"" and it is immediately clear that Toho has become rusty on how to make excellent Godzilla films. The elements of a classic such as compelling storyline, good kaiju opponent, and several moments of high drama are all present. The problem with this film is execution. The effects are subpar for the series, which really pulls the viewer out of the movie. Worse still the progression of the storyline seems choppy at best. This jarring progression of events in ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" really irritates me, because the concept of an intelligent animal like King Kong squaring off against the brute force of Godzilla is very appealing. I suspect some of these problems are due to editing of this film for American audiences, so I may revise this movie review when I see the Japanese version. The US version is 7 minutes shorter than the Japanese version, and the American version has 10-15 minutes of scenes in English only. No doubt these scenes provided at least some of the continuity lacking from the US version Taken as it is, ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" is a fair but uneven Godzilla film that leaves me wanting for more.",1080345600,2,1298,4.722466960352423
691822,2,630362572X,"First off the rumor going around that Kong wins in the american version and godzilla wins at the japanese version is false. In the Japanese version both of them roar at the end thats the only difference.
First off this Godzilla was first color picture Godzilla star in. It wasn't a great flick but it wasn't to bad. Godzilla suit was alright not as good as some of the laters ones but it was alright. Kong LOL man he look so cheap i mean TOHO really miss him up bad. He look so goofy,face was stupid and acted dumb in my point of view. It seems Kong loves Electricity and gets stronger
if he gets struck by it what are the chances of that.
First the movies starts an island when an giant octopus attacks
the girl and boy in a house that was full of berry juice. Then
Kong comes out and defeats it. Meanwhile a pilot notice that godzilla is breaking out of an iceberg and was the news all across tokyo. The idea of the people is to let kong and godzilla
fight it out to simply destroy each other.
First off theres no chance in hell King King aka Donkey Kong
would beat godzilla. All godzilla have to do is use his fire breath and the monkey would got roasted but it seems the movie
did a cheap thing about that. But overall the monster fighting
was pretty good but the movie wasn't so be kinda disappointed

First of all, I rented King Kong vs. Godzilla in Japanese for 2 days, and it was bad, but this was absolutley WORSE! Scenes were cut out, King Kong's suit was terrible, Godzilla's suit was a reptilian design and terrible, there were some clay fighting, and Godzilla kept clapping his hands! IT WAS AWFUL!! This film, in my opinion, is the worse film of the 60's, with Godzilla's Revenge being the second worse, and Godzilla vs. Mothra being the third worse.

I mean, the big lizard's atomic fire-breath should have made this a very short film, w/ Kong going up like the world's biggest gasoline-soaked haystack! Instead, King Kong (who was killed by mere airplanes in his original feature) slugs it out with a confused, dopey version of our favorite giant reptile. Even as a kid I knew that Godzilla was 400 feet tall and Kong was supposed to be 30 feet at best (I know, I know, I shouldn't aply logic or continuity to this, but it bugs me)! I also had problems with the fact that both creatures died horrible, irreversible deaths in their original movies. AAAAARGG!! Anyway, if you've got kids or can still suspend disbelief, this is a good way to waste an afternoon. The set-up is perfectly absurd, having something to do w/ a crop of giant berries, an island, and a mysterious, giant creature (Kong). There's also an idealized United Nations, that simultaneously dispatches a mission to the island, while their game-show-host-like spokesman narrates the proceedings.

The first has always been Godzilla vs. The Thing.
This is the kind of movie that is best enjoyed on a cold winters night and a huge bowl of popcorn.  It is far one of Toho Studios most ambitious productions.  The set designs, costumes and miniature effects are superior for that time period and have a great look.
The film offers great action sequences, interesting characters and just the right touches of humor,slapstick and fun.
This is the kind of monster movie that was made at a time when studios didn't have to dump millions of dollars on special effects and actors salaries.

This disc contains a 4:3 picture (I don't know if this is the original ratio so I won't comment)and has scratches throughout. The colours are not very good and look washed out and the whole picture looks flat. It has a mono soundtrack which is passable. The extras are, Subtitles in English, Spanish and French(although only english as an audio option), producion note, which is actually one page of text which gives you a very very small insight into the film. It has chapters too and when you put the disc in it goes straight to the menu no copyright notices or anything. The version on the disc is the american edited version and only that.
Good Points: It's watchable if you don't have any other copy.
Bad Points:It doesn't have an option for the japanese version, the film hasn't been restored at all and not even a trailer as an extra??
The rating is for the DVD, I rated it 2 stars because it is watchable as a bog standard version of the movie but more dedicated fans should save their money for a future release.",1038873600,6,1075,4.546391752577319

691973,4,630362572X,"This is a great movie to watch with your entire family. It rules!
The basic premise here is that King Kong and Godzilla get into a fight. As you may already, both are huge monsters. Anyway, it's a clash of titans!  It's the U.S.A. vs. Japan is a battle royale!!!
Godzilla messed with Kong, so Kong was forced to teach Godzilla a lesson. Although this movie would have been greatly enhanced if Kong had bodyslammed Godzilla or applied a sleeper hold or a full-Nelson, the action scenes are still rather exhilarating!
The outcome of the fight, however, leaves something to be desired.  I expected King Kong to twist off Godzilla's head and spike it on the floor!  However, it was not meant to be - Godzilla was too formidible of an opponent.  The match-up is similar to a hypothetical wresting match between Hulk Hogan and Goldberg - neither athlete holds a big advantage over the other.
In any event, go buy a huge tub of popcorn and view this flick with your entire family!  It's better than most movies out there.  Also, the DVD transfer is fantastic!",1016582400,5,1052,4.598930481283422
692119,5,630362572X,"While the King Kong costume leaves something to be desired the effects were a little worse. You can actually see the spears being thrown against a movie screen during the octopus invasion. A must for Godzilla die hards like myself, but I wonder if the Toho Corporation got any credit for this gem. The scientist that found the island of King Kong named the native berry mixture SOMA. Soma did not act like the acient plants of some cults as a physcotrpic drug, but instead the scientist found it to be a depressant. In fact it is described as follows and is very close to the what scientist describe in the movie: CARISOPRODOL (Soma) is a rapidly acting muscle relaxant causing central nervous system depressant effects.
I wonder if Toho got any credit?",1013644800,,753,4.669172932330827
692120,4,630362572X,"I'll let King Kong explain it in his own words:
So there I was, just relaxing and minding my own business.  I had just popped back a few giant narcotic berries and decided to lay back and listen to the groovey beats being laid down by the natives on their drums while some hot native chicks danced around me, and I started to snooze.  Suddenly, I wake up and I cannot move an inch!  Then there's this big flash of light and I find myself wading in the middle of a sea!  I was all like ""Whooah, what did I DO last night? Those narcotic berries must have been spiked!""  So I head for the nearest land and there's like this big rubber Lizard King just spazzing out all over the place, breathing fire and stuff.  He sees me, comes up to me and just starts pounding his fists on me.  Well, excuse me for living! Like, sorry man, this was just not my scene so I decide to split.
I'm heading off minding my own business again when these green fairies with spinning blades for wings fly up to me and start sprinkling this white powder all over me.  I breath some in and, MAN, I'm feeling fiiiine! It's just like those narcotic berries I love so much, but condensed for purer effect!  So I lay back again, doing my own thing, when I wake up again, and man, wouldn't you know it, there's that Lizard King again, just harshin' my buzz!!  Hey, I'm a pacifist, but this dude just keeps laying it on thick, so I decide to fight back, and there's all this flashing lightning and ****.  Maaan, that was some wild bummer of a trip.  The moral?  The best I can think of is ""Know your dealer"".
(Me again): Yes, it's Godzilla, representative of the brave, clean-living Japanese vs. King Kong, symbol of the drug-addicted decadence of western youth and frightened pacifist.  Whether King Kong or Godzilla wins at the end of the movie depends on whether you're watching the Japanese or American version.",1012521600,3,1881,4.367816091954023

Yessiree, you'd better be hidin' those scale models, `cuz it's throwdown time!

Japanese homeland is torn asunder when the two behemoths do finally meet. The land is burned and smashed in every conceivable
fashion. At times if you really looked hard you could tell that
Godzilla and King Kong were men in suits and hand puppets. That
alone did not detract from the film. You would still have to classify it as a classic. Buy and watch this movie. You will never forget it.",1004832000,11,639,4.565217391304348
692123,4,630362572X,"When you talk about this movie, the whole conversation necessarily comes down to two words: who won?  When you have two major money-making monsters, you can't very well kill either one of them, of course, so you cannot definitively proclaim a victor in this epic battle.  There is a slight difference between the American and Japanese versions of the film; while Kong clearly is seen swimming away, the Japanese version (so I read) features a roar from Godzilla at the end, clearly indicating he is not dead or defeated.  Some argue that Kong is supposedly our ""American"" monster, so Americans are led to believe he won, while Japanese audiences are led to believe that their monster won.  This is hogwash to me.  There is no way King Kong could defeat Godzilla.  The first time they meet, Kong quickly turns and runs, scratching his head.  In the finale, Godzilla pretty much beats the (...) out of him for several minutes, and Kong even stupidly conks himself head-first onto a big rock and knocks his own lights out.  Kong's only offense is to throw rocks and to get his opponent into some type of bear hug.  At the end, both monsters plummet into the water--Godzilla does not resurface (but of course he is aquatic), and Kong leaves.  I like to believe that Kong is running away from Godzilla, but each viewer has to decide the true outcome on his own.
This movie gets a little weird.  First off, forget earlier movies--no one has seen Godzilla, frozen in ice for millions of years, or King Kong before (even though the folks who discover Godzilla immediately identify him by name).  Naturally, Godzilla heads directly for Japan.  Some scientist has discovered the sleep-inducing powers of the red berries found only on a small island; a caricature of a man who runs a TV station and pharmaceutical company sends a Japanese Laurel and Hardy to find the monster-god of the island.  Music and cigarettes win over the natives, but then a giant octopus shows up and threatens to destroy the berry juice that the natives use to supplicate Kong, only to be thrashed by the big ape, after which Kong slurps down a few barrels of juice and passes out like a drunk.  He is dragged back toward Japan on a barge, but then escapes.  He heads for Godzilla, runs away like a little girl when he first encounters him, then decides to content himself with stomping around on the Japanese mainland for a while.  Inevitably, Kong's weakness for the ladies distracts him; he is drugged and then transported by giant balloons to Mt. Fuji to fight in the main event against Godzilla.
The special effects in this movie are sometimes good and sometimes awful.  The King Kong costume is just horrible, I feel.  Kong looks like Charles Manson after a long night of drinking.  Godzilla walks around like a hockey goalie in full pads late in the film, but overall he looks pretty good.  Don't ask why, but Godzilla dislikes electricity in this film; Kong, on the other hand, loves it and draws strength from it (a declaration made early on by scientists despite the total lack of anything resembling proof of the fact).  The scenes featuring folks running around right in front of the monsters are amateurish--the people are blue and semi-opaque; scenes featuring the girl held in Kong's grasp feature a doll that looks little better than a corn cob with some black hair stuck on top of it.  Some of the models used look exactly like models.  When it comes to Godzilla movies, though, these things really don't matter to me; in fact, I would be disappointed if there were no ultra-cheap looking special effects.  Oddly enough, the giant octopus that makes a cameo appearance seems pretty realistic.  The most annoying feature in the film is the series of clips featuring Eric Carter on the United Nations television network.  I'm not sure if these scenes are in the Japanese version, but they serve no good purpose in the film.
A lot of people praise the final battle between the monsters, but I frankly found it disappointing.  As I mentioned, Kong doesn't bring a lot of offense to the fight, and you can almost hear Godzilla saying ""Get up, you loser,"" when Kong knocks his own lights out.  The bit where Kong stuffs a tree down Godzilla's throat is pretty funny, but he gets few points from me outside of that one move.  Basically, what we need here is a rematch.  Let's get a new incarnation of Godzilla and King Kong back together and put an end to the controversy over who won the first fight.  I'll put my money on Godzilla.",1004745600,10,4509,4.67553865652725
692124,3,630362572X,"""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" offers the spectacle of King Kong battling Godzilla. Of course, ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" is the American title for this film, which was known as ""Godzilla vs. King Kong"" in Japan (at least that is what I heard once and it sounds good to me, even if it is not true). The plot finds a Japanese pharmaceutical company taking King Kong back to Japan to advertise their products while some American pilots free Godzilla from the block of ice where he has been frozen. King Kong warms up on an octopus while Godzilla tangles with a nuclear sub, before they butt heads and trash Tokyo before taking their grudge match to Mt. Fuji. Of course I rooted for King Kong, him being the ""American"" monster and all, but I did feel a tad guilty since Godzilla was the local monster. This film was Godzilla's first appearance in color. Of course, the Toho production was recut for an American audience, leaving out any semblance of character development by the human actors so the audience could just enjoy the battles. This joint Japanese/American production paved the way for later cinematic efforts between the two countries, such as ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" in the sense that the film about Pearl Harbor came out after this 1962 film. Director Inoshiro Honda directed the original ""Godzilla, King of Monsters,"" as well as ""Rodan,"" ""Mothra,"" ""Godzilla vs. Mothra"" and other giant rubber monster classics. Clearly, Honda is to this genre what Kurosawa is to samurai films.  Actually, the whole affair is pretty silly.

692125,3,630362572X,"This is an enjoyable Godzilla movie and is the third in the series. Godzilla breaks free from the ice that trapped him in the previous movie, Godzilla Raids Again (aka Gigantis, The Fire Monster). Here Godzilla is the bad guy. I think you can probably guess the basic plot.
It gets silly at some points. Don't get caught up in production mistakes. Just enjoy the ride. Here electricity is supposed to harm (or at least slow down) Godzilla, but later in the series, Godzilla gains his strength from lightning. (The lightning comes up in Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla - aka Godzilla vs. The Cosmic Monster.) Plus, electrical lines didn't affect him in the original movie either.
This film had the potential of getting into legal trouble. The basic idea for this movie originally came from Willis O'Brien. He had the idea of having King Kong fight a large Frankenstein. Unfortunately, he shared his idea with the wrong person who would later take the idea to Toho without O'Brien's knowledge. O'Brien learned about it just before he died.
I find the packaging for this DVD (and the VHS edition) interesting if you consider some stunts that Toho pulled when promoting this movie. Back in 1963, Toho used images of the 1933 Kong on the posters. The ape costume looks nothing like O'Brien's version of Kong. The packaging for this video edition uses images from other versions of the monsters too. Kong does not look that real. The version of Godzilla shown here (in the lower portion with the red background) looks like the version used from 1973-1975 (Japanese release dates) which included Megalon and the original Mechagodzilla movies. I can't place which movie the close-up is from.",998697600,12,1678,4.891228070175439

This guy's expressions and answers about dinosaurs are worth the low price of the DVD alone! The actors portraying the television company suits that ""owns"" Kong are poor at best, and were not taking the film seriously at all. Yes, the Ape costume is really atrocious, you could rent a better one at your local costume shop. But the Godzilla costume is one of the best of all the 60's-70's films and the fight scenes are straight out of the WWF. At one point, Kong literally bodyslams Godzilla! All in all, one of the most fun of the Godzilla films to watch, and the ending is open to endless speculation to who won. Zilla buffs say Kong was running away a la Oscar de la Hoya, whereas Kong-a-maniacs say the lizard was overpowered and left to die in the Pacific.

692217,1,630362572X,"In the book The Official Godzilla Compendium, King Kong Vs Godzilla is described as ""The Jaws of the Japanese film Industry"" or ""One of the great monster battles of cinema history"". It is referred to as the film that ""...Lifted Godzilla from the swelling ranks of interchangeable atomic monsters of the fifties and placed him among the pantheon of cinema creatures"". Thus, I had high expectations when I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel.
All I have to say is: Wow! The special effects are incredible! The acting is top notch. The screenplay is well written. This film is truly a classic of cinema that will leave you thinking long after you leave the theater.
Wait. That's my review for 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Here's what I really think of King Kong vs. Godzilla.
A thousand words cannot describe my dislike of the film. I know it's a Godzilla film, but did it need to be this bad? It starts off good, with an excellent piece of music at the beginning credits. But soon goes downhill as we are introduced to U.N Reporter Eric Carter. All he was put in for was to make the film longer and annoy us. He ""communicates"" with people in Japan via a satellite that looks more like a first grade science project than visual effects. He constantly tells us that ""Godzilla is heading for Japan"" or ""King Kong and Godzilla will battle."" Duh! What do you think King Kong and Godzilla will do? Have tea and crumpets?
Speaking of Kong, I have seen costumes that look better than this Kong suit. I would also rather listen to Celine Dion and Elton John do a music number together than listen to Kong roar. He doesn't even open his mouth! Godzilla appears just fine, except for the fact he's afraid of thermal energy (Didn't he tear down an electrical fence in 1954 with ease?). Kong however gets power from the thermal energy. Gee, I would assume that all his fur would make him the perfect conductor of elctricity. Also, doesn't anyone else notice that the islands of the first Godzilla movies (The '50s to the '70s) always look the same? The main battles themselves are also letdowns.
It was a grand idea that Toho had: Pitting two titans of cinema against each other. Too bad the Japanese did not use stop motion animation. Or make a Kong/Godzilla rematch. Or make better costumes or etc, etc. For a true classic of monster cinema, King Kong, the original Godzilla or Godzilla 1985 are better choices than this pile of ... If this was the film that made Godzilla famous, he should have been assassinated.
Indeed this film will leave you thinking after you leave the theater: Why did I waste my time on this?
(Note: Perhaps my criticism was a bit harsh. After all, this is the American version of the movie and we always [mess] with perfection. Maybe the Japanese version is better. Get that one if you can).",986947200,3,2797,4.573705179282869

What a stupid movie, and this is coming from  someone who loves stupid movies. Watching this movie is like sitting in a  dentist's chair and listening to Rod Stewart during a root  canal.
Godzilla came off OK, but is that really supposed to be King Kong?  It looks like Ron Jeremy got splattered with play-doh. The closeups of  Kongs face are ludicrous. When he's drinking the berry juice that the South  Pacific Islands offer to him, it looks like a child's project gone horribly  wrong. The acting in the movie is decent, but what everybody cares about is  the fight right? So here goes.
Godzilla is running amock, so let's get  Kong to fight him and cause even more damage than Godzilla could cause on  his own. They fly Kong to Godzilla with weather balloons as Kong sleeps  stiff as a 2x4. OK now here's where it gets silly. Kong is an ape, just an  ape keep that in mind. For the movie Kong grew from 50 ft. to 100 ft. Of  course this can be overlooked. Could you imagine a midget in a monkey suit  fighting Godzilla? Right OK so anyway. Godzilla as we all know is a  radioactive monster, and Kong is what? That's right just a giant ape. So  why is it that Kong needs lightning to strike him to gain strengh and fight  harder? I can see that working for Godzilla, but Kong? Who thought that  up.
This movie needs to be redone with modern techniques. Make it a joint  project. Let the Americans do Kong, and the Japanese do Godzilla. A  Japanese version of King Kong is as bad as an American version of a compact  car.",968198400,4,1625,4.32890365448505

Scenes with American ""actors"" were added, other scenes  were either shuffled or deleted, and the vast majority of the score was  removed and replaced by stock music from such films as Creature From the  Black Lagoon.

Both the  American and Japanese versions of the film end exactly the same except that  in the American film you hear Kong's roar at the end and in the Japanese  version you hear Godzilla's roar right after Kong's so that the audience  knows that both monsters survived. There is no difference in the film  itself, only the soundtrack.  but a completely different ending have been  discovered were indeed godzilla does win \ but this ver. is not avaible on  home video even for the japanase today

One thing I have to say, though, as a Gojiraolgist (someone who studies Godzilla), Godzilla did  NOT win in the japeness version. It was a tie in both version.
By the  way, to that person who said it was the only tie Godzilla had, you are  wrong. He had a tie with Rodan in ""GHIDORAH: THE 3 HEADED  MONSTER"" (1964); one with MechaGodzilla in ""GODZILLA VS.  MECHAGODZILLA"" (1974); and one with MechaGhidorah in ""GODZILLA  VS. KING GHIDORAH"" (1991) among others.
Other all, though, a preety  good movie. Tristar's ""GODZILLA"" (1998) diffently pales in  comprasion.",955065600,,686,4.803418803418803
692325,5,630362572X,"This is the coolest Godzilla film of all 23 of them. The Godzilla costume looks the most like a reptile than all the rest of the costumes. He has a ferrowed brow and menicing eyes. His face overall just looks like a normal  backyard lizard. He is huge and bulky, he is really a little too bulky, but  that is made up by a great movie! On the other hand, the King Kong costume  is awful! As talked about in the title, he looks like an overgrown, hairy,  pot bellied, middle aged man who is worshiped by japanese natives. Director  Inoshiro Honda said he wanted his costume to surpass the classic  stop-motion Kong from the 1933 RKO Film. That wasn't the case at all. When  the movie came to America it was dubbed in english and scenes were added  with ""reporter Eric Carter"". When Godzilla first appears he  destroyes the ""Sea Hawk"" submarine and rages onto land he seems  like an unstopable force. Whatch for cheesy Godzilla hand puppet that blows  radioactive breath and melts a tank. Then some japanese guys from a  pharmacy company find King Kong on an island and want to use him as their  mascot. So, they drug him and ship him off to Japan. He awakens and escapes  {of course} and rages through Tokyo. Meeting in Nikko the two monsters  battle and make their way to Mt. Fugi where the fight for a whole 7 1/2  minutes and then fall into the water. Only Kong surfaces, many Godzilla  fans say that Kong was running from Godzilla's turf. Many King Kong fans  say that Kong defeated Godzilla, thought his work was done and decided to  head home. Either way this was a great film. Obviously Toho decided to let  the fans decide who won. Personally, I feel that it was a draw. Both  monsters are equal in strength and power and I can't say who I like more  so, in my book, they both won.",952819200,9,1787,4.367781155015198

Short synopsis: the original (Japanese) ""King Kong vs.  Godzilla"" was a widescreen tour-de-force as far as story and SFX are  concerned--the original film, believe it or not, was a cleverly written  SATIRE, and not just another ""bad"" sci-fi film from the early  Sixties.  The American version quite frankly butchers the original  Japanese film...apparently John Beck (the producer) and company didn't have  a CLUE as to what this film was actually about.  I'll sum it up simply: if  you can get an uncut, Japanese version of this flick, then by all means,  get it.

692328,5,630362572X,"Summing up ""King Kong Vs. Godzilla"" in four words: Silly, stupid, pointless, FUN! As a child, I was a huge fan of the Toho films featuring the giants lizards, dinos, turtles, and apes, and I would have to  say that this is the funnest of them all. Even now, I still get guilty  pleasures out of it. The plot is entirely childish, and the monsters'  battle might be the coolest thing since Bruce Lee hammered it out with  Chuck Norris in ""Return of the Dragon."" (Well, actually, I might  be wrong....I think this came out before that one. If that's the case, then  this is the coolest fight ever). Stonecold Steve Austin, eat your heart  out!
Many are turned away by the ape suit, but I feel it just adds to the  camp value! It isn't any more cheezy than Godzilla stomping on those  plastic tanks. LONG LIVE THE MEN IN THE RUBBER SUITS!
This is also a  historic Godzilla film for a single reason: None of the monsters really  won. This is the only draw in the history of Godzilla movies, as far as I  can tell! With that in mind, how dare any of us miss such a camp classic  gem?
(On a side note, this film had a sequel: ""King Kong  Escapes,"" where the massive ape returns to Tokyo and gets into a  no-holds barred brawl with Mecha-Kong, his mechanical replica. This is  equally a good time, but it is yet to be released to video or DVD in the  states...Hmmm... Do it, Toho...Do it!)",947376000,7,1382,4.294573643410852
