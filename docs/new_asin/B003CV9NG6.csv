8394501,5,B003CV9NG6,"This film will help people to understand the severity of the persecution, and to understand what many Falun Gong adherents in China are going through.

If you would like to read more about the Falun Gong persecution, I would recommend the website 'stoppersecution.net'",1323734400,,268,5.232558139534884
8394502,5,B003CV9NG6,This is a great and informational documentary that really opened my eyes to the situation in China. This is a must see!,1288224000,,119,4.454545454545454
8394503,5,B003CV9NG6,"There's only a handful of material out there devoted exclusively to the Falun Gong issue (Danny Schechter's book (and video), David Ownby's books, one section of Ian Johnson's book, Peter Rowe's documentary, etc.) and this is one of the better ones. In particular, it does a good job of explaining how Falun Gong developed in China in the '90's, and how it fits into the narrative of modern China as a whole, which is missing from other accounts that focus solely on the persecution. I guess I would have liked to hear more about the people who held up banners in Tiananmen after 1999, but overall I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in China.",1269216000,8,672,4.608333333333333
