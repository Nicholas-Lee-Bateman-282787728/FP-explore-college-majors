8289701,5,B001CU92GK,"This is a really good show with several stories about Navy Corpsman & Army medics and the heroism in and under the line of fire from WWII to Vietnam.  It brought tears to my eyes to what they did and to what they went through with live clips from them the wars in mention.  As a Corpsman myself, it makes me proud to be one of the men men they called ""Doc!""",1357948800,3,357,3.9444444444444446
8289702,5,B001CU92GK,i have read a few books about navy corpsmen. this book covered the whole history of the hospital corpsmen. I was a combat corpsman in vietnam at the end of the tet offensive in 1968. I was with the 7th marines on hill 55 and I was wounded on january 7 1969. I am now 70% disabled but I still am in contact with the guys who survived. as the marines would say Semper Fi,1349049600,5,368,3.92
8289703,5,B001CU92GK,"I was a corpman stationed at the naval hospial Beaufort South Carolina from April1971 to May1973. I worked on the SOQward and the pediatric clinic.  The history of the hospital corp goes a long way. However to all you marines out there past and present. stop calling Navy hospial corpman ""SQUIDS"". If I had a dollar for every time I was called that in 4 years I could pay off the national debt twice over. It is obnoxious and insulting. These brave men risk there lives to treat marine wounded. Without them the casualty list of dead would bea heck of a lot longer. Martin E. Kinsey husband od Susan Owen Kinsey.",1287187200,3,612,4.464285714285714

This is a concise & objective view of a special breed of sailor - those called to minister to the sick & injured, primarily sailors & Marines, but Corpsmen ""don't stop & look for a Marine or Navy uniform"". The history begins with just a brief mention of ""lob-lollie boys"" who helped ships' surgeons in the earliest years of United States formation as a nation. the next brief glimpse comes with the Civil War. In this case, it seemed as Hospital Corpsmen were no different than Army medics & were called ""surgeons' stewards"". Finally, when the video addresses WWI, it seems the distinct history of the Hospital Corps becomes evident. During WWII, the viewer is told Hospital Corpsmen are known as Pharmacists' Mates. I would have liked to have heard when that designation was used & why & then when the designation Hospital Corpsman started to be used. The histores of Korean War & Vietnam War were satisfactory, given the time requirement for the entire program. In the end, it made me proud & I can proudly say ""I was one of them!""",1240790400,7,1326,5.46829268292683
