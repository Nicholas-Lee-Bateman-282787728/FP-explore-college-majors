4123434,3,B003GUGB8G,"When I came across this version of Romero's classic, I was at once intrigued and skeptical (and I attribute my skepicism to the anniversary edition which included the ""new footage"" including the fire-and-brimstone preacher (as described by one reviewer). But my aforementioned intrigue won, and I ordered this. I guess I was expecting something different, perhaps an ""anime-style"" version. The opening scene in which Barbara and Johnny are sitting in the vehicle talking initially made me say to myself, ""Oh, geez..."" but the pace picked up, somewhat. This isn't really my proverbial cup of tea, but I do give credit for the vision. The live-action sequences were interesting, but the still panels reminded me of the narrated animation version of ""The Watchmen,"" which I found very distracting.

Word of advice (and kudos to the production company and the ""Count"" for this suggestion): If you have never seen the original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" do not let this ""reanimated"" version be your first experience. Watch the original first; otherwise, you may be distracted and decide to bypass this classic. May I recommend the Millenium edition? Once you've seen the original classic, your appreciation of ""Night of the Living Dead - Reanimated"" will most likely be much greater.",1322092800,,1279,5.178743961352657
4123435,1,B003GUGB8G,"Had they stuck to one or two, or even five or six animation styles this could have been great. Or even broken the styles down by chapter like Animatrix did. Instead this is an epileptic mess of poor animation, bottom barrel talent most of the time with only a few entertaining exceptions. Considering that the movie itself is public domain, I feel ripped off for what I paid for this jumbled mess. Sometimes indie does not mean good.",1313193600,4,433,4.564102564102564
4123436,4,B003GUGB8G,"Whenever someone ""reimagines"" a classic movie, I'm always a little skeptical.  No one wants their favorite movie to get screwed up.  So it was with some trepidation that I watched this film.  But I was pleasantly surprised with the result.  The heart and soul remained intact while the new angle made it fresh and energized.

The first few minutes are somewhat dizzying as a multitude of various animation styles whiz past you.  After a short while, things settle down as the changes in the animation isn't so fast and furious, and the viewer is given more time to enjoy each style (and enjoy I did!).  It was great fun to watch all of the different animation styles employed in this film.  This is such a creative project, my mind was blown with how the artists used their styles to emphasize certain finer points of the film.  Some of my favorites scenes were the sock puppets, the claymation, the Edvard Munch type of artwork, and other styles that are so crazy I don't know how to even describe them.

I was truly fascinated by this whole movie.  I think that it is a labor of love and and a sincere tribute to the original ""Night of the Living Dead"".  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves George Romero, zombie films, animation, or who would like to see a truly creative piece of work.  All of the artists who contributed to this project should be commended and congratulated on this amazing achievement.",1291334400,5,1420,4.587301587301587
4123437,2,B003GUGB8G,My dad and I are huge fans of the Night of the Living Dead movies.  I got this because I thought it would be a great flick for one of our father/daughter movie nights.  I wouldn't say that this version is one of my favorites.  It's definitely new and different but I couldn't really get into it.,1288224000,3,295,4.140350877192983
4123438,4,B003GUGB8G,"With the exceptions of the Romero-approved Millennium and Dimension Films editions, NOTLD-Reanimated is certainly the best thing to happen to this classic on DVD (stay away from the colorized, 30th anniversary, 3D and Blu-ray editions).  It doesn't reimagine the film, but rather ""resurrects"" the film aesthetically.  With each new clip, we get to explore the film in another medium: comics, drawing, computer-generated imagery, puppets, video games and altered video.  The DVD provides just the right context to enjoy it all, complete with audio commentaries, featurettes and a perfectly schlocky (and I mean that as a compliment) introduction by a vampiric ""Count Gore de Vol,"" who prefaces NOTLD-Reanimated while parading around a makeshift goofy-spook soundstage circa 1970.  To me, it all strikes the right tone -- no pretense, just fun and appreciation of this landmark horror film.

However, this exquisite corpse never quite equals the sum of its parts.  Many of the visual styles are too often repeated, yet none of the segments is really allowed to come to fruition.  As a result, frustration, and a pressing desire to switch to the original film, can set in pretty quickly on a casual viewer.  Hopefully, this just the start of a larger ""body"" of work, and the team at Wild Eye should know that this reviewer would eagerly look forward to another ""reanimated"" jam session.",1285977600,4,1383,5.170403587443946
4123439,3,B003GUGB8G,"The sad fact for George Romero and (perhaps) good news for Horror Fans is that ""Night of the Living Dead"" is in the Public Domain, which means that, whatever someone wants to do with it (and make money doing it)they can do it...for FREE, while the original creator and actors have to just sit there and wonder how much they could be making had that one, little ""copyright mistake"" not have happened.
The people who have concocted this little exercise in ""artistic expression"" have managed to bring together an impressive number of ""Fans"" of the original to give it an entirely new look that is mostly impressive, but unfortunately, sometimes irritatingly ridiculous.
Had they chosen to not give-way to the dubious artistic expression of about 5-10 of the 100 artists, this would have received a higher rating.
There really is NOTHING funny about ""Night of the Living Dead"", unless you find
the sheriff's lack of sensitivity and strong-survival tactics to be amusing (I do...to a point).
So, unfortunately (for me)I had to suffer-through a ""Barbi Doll"" version of Helen's demise and some-kind of ""plush lion toy"" trying to get into Barbara's car.
You just SHOULDN'T destroy those important scenes' intensity with childish
""expressionism"".
Less important scenes such as the news reports being played by sock-puppets are successful and perhaps even ""sublime"" and Barbara's fragile mental state is beautifully redone in ""stick-figure"".
The big ""pluses"" are some beautifully-done renderings of the ""half-eaten corpse"",and some of the zombies, which are terrifying in their realism.
The thought-provoking and terrifying re-imagining of the scene where Ben is
stalked by what looks like ""KKK Members"" in place of zombies, is perhaps the ""artistic high-point"" of this venture, which after all is said and done, is definitely worth one's time (and, of course) money.",1276214400,17,1857,5.23489932885906

8396556,5,B003GUGB8G,"This is definitely a movie for hardcore fans of the original film.  If you love the original, you will really enjoy the animated version.  Each section of the film is animated by a different artist.  Each artist is paying their tribute to this landmark film and you can really tell that it is a labor of love.  The section animated by Voodoo Velvet is a particular favorite of mine as I have been following her work for some time.  A cool way to celebrate and relive the film.",1493683200,,476,4.363636363636363
8396557,2,B003GUGB8G,"Not great. Seemed like a wasted opportunity in my opinion. The animation was all over the place and I get that was probably the point, to showcase the different styles but it didn't work for me. Check it out only if you have to see everything related to NOTLD.",1465689600,,260,4.326530612244898
8396558,1,B003GUGB8G,"The reviews here are about right. I had gotten this as a gift. The disk (brand new) wouldn't play in anything but my laptop. I had a friend who was one of the artists in this collection and I just couldn't do this. I got maybe twenty minutes in and it just doesn't work. Even knowing my friend's art I couldn't watch this to get to it.

The styles are too jarring. You go from still images and can't quite make out what's going on....then you go to fully animated....to sock puppets....to weird and bad CG. If it was all actual animation it may have worked. But too much of it was still images and it just fell very flat. Avoid this like the plague.",1448409600,2,649,4.192
8396559,5,B003GUGB8G,This is a GREAT take on this film. It is PURE art. So if you don't like art then you will not like this aspect of this film. It is the original sound and screenplay of the movie with 150 International Artists demonstrating their personal take on their favorite scene. This is a True Horror Fan Collector Item. FOR SURE! I am a Horror Collector and this is definitely something you need to own if you like ART and Night Of the Living Dead. Its ART People. ART!,1410220800,3,459,4.2272727272727275

8396562,1,B003GUGB8G,The animation is horrid looks like they got a buch of 3rd graders to draw and animate it. Best watch the original and shoot this one in the head it's complete crap.,1352160000,,164,4.15625

8396564,1,B003GUGB8G,"I would give this zero stars if I could, this project is awful.

The concept is exciting and I was expecting something more along the lines of ""Waking Life,"" but the execution is just awful.  The level of so-called ""animation"" is atrocious; This looks like a classroom of junior high students had one day to animate the entire movie, and half of them quit.  Based on the concept and the reviews, I gave it a shot and boy do I regret it.

My friends and I watched this as part of a horror movie marathon and it was the only movie we could not finish because it was totally unwatchable.  We put in the Savini remake instead.

It's also super low resolution, so unless you're watching on a phone it looks like crap.",1327536000,,712,4.315789473684211
