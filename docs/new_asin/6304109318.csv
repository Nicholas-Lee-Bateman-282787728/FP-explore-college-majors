784295,5,6304109318,"I loved this movie.  I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.  John Malkovich gives a fantastic and compelling performance as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  He is so sinister (in a sexy way) yet so endearing that I  couldn't keep my eyes off of him.  I was also very impressed by Julia  Roberts.  She convincingly played the part of Mary Reilly, Dr. Jekyll's  maid.  There is rather a bit of gore, so if you are really squeamish, maybe  this isn't the movie for you.  I definitely and truly recommend this movie.",912038400,,515,4.43010752688172

784547,4,6304109318,"Two decades ago I had seen this movie, this re-imagining of the ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" classic through the perspective of a background character: Mr. Jekyll's maid Mary Reilly. Based on an original best seller written by Valerie Martin, her take allowed enriching details to nourish Stevenson's novella; either through the Victorian social classes of the time (masters and servants, nobles and commoners, men versus women), the take on life, death, and medicine in the nineteenth century, London's slums and its devilish reality, but also paternal abuse between the titular character and her father; whose fights with his daughter imply something more sinister from him.

Originally meant to be a Tim Burton production with Winona Ryder as Reilly and Christopher Hampton on the script, Burton left due to issues with Sony Pictures, the film's owner, regarding the fate of his movie Ed Wood. An incident that put Mary Reilly's adaptation in danger until Stephen Frears came on board, reuniting with his former scriptwriter, but also John Malkovich as Jekyll, Glenn Close as Mrs. Faraday, Philippe Rousselot as director of Photography, George Fenton as composer, Norma Heyman as producer, and Stuart Craig in Production Design. In short, a large portion of the Dangerous Liaisons film crew came on board, giving to many the impression the movie would be a masterpiece like the Laclos Adaptation. Among the actors asked for the title role came various names like Uma Thurman, but ultimately the choice fell on Julia Roberts. A nice surprise as she was and is mostly doing comedic roles and romantic films. Giving her an opportunity to see another display of that actress's talents.

On the plus sides of Mary Reilly, the visuals are wonderful and rich. Smoggy London fog, imposing stone structures, top notch Victorian costumes, ghoulish laboratories, subtle photography and soundtrack including a memorable leitmotif for the main character the work is top notch. Everything is displayed to add tensions through the movie. Work tension for the servants as they scurry around like mouses to obey their boss or to suffer Mr. Poole's wrath as he's their manager. Or their boss's as strange incidents occur around Mr. Hyde, his newest assistant. Therefore, tension impregnates the movie, increasing until the final tragedy occurs.

About the actors, everyone offers a fine job portraying their characters. But on a downside, and this is what I noticed after further viewings, was the lack of chemistry between Roberts and Malkovich. Indeed, for those who follow the production of the film, I read Julia Roberts and John Malkovich did not get along together, which can still happen even in the film making business who gives to its public the illusion that everyone's best friends and adores giving hugs to one another. Utopian reality. Now I know that it is not because a lack of chemistry can occur between actors that this means the movie's doomed. Why, I heard the main actors of the NoteBook did not get along, but still they gave a top notch acting and made their movie a wonderful work to watch. But in the case of Mary Reilly, the marks are still there for very rarely did I feel any romantic chemistry between Roberts's Reilly and Malkovich's Jekyll. Instead, her chemistry with Malkovich was much stronger through his performances as the abusive Mr. Hyde, whose dangerous character makes a strong parallel with Reilly's relationship and her father.
Now it's not to say that the two were dreadful actors. To me, each were fine for their acting. A good Jekyll and a good Reilly when they're working separately or with other actors. But together, they have trouble clicking.
So maybe the best solution would have been to have either a Reilly with more chemistry with Malkovich like Uma Thurman, which could have worked as they clicked in Dangerous Liaisons, or a Jekyll with a better chemistry for Roberts while leaving Hyde's role to Malkovich.

And on another note, I was still wondering if that last scene was necessary or if it couldn't have been shot a better way. Apparently, it was one of various reshots the production had to pull after the ending of the movie. But I'd wish they could have used either one closer to the original novel, or another much more dramatic for Reilly. Indeed, the ending Stephen Frears shot lacks strength and with what she witnessed, her actions at the end and what happens to Mr. Hyde may raise questions between the house members and the authorities. For in the real world, more dramatic consequences could have occurred then.

Now as a whole I give Mary Reilly four stars as the movie wonderful for its visuals, music, and very good story. However, I still have the feeling that Mary Reilly could have been better. That is with two main actors with a better chemistry together and a more powerful ending for this movie that deserves better recognition than the bad reviews it got on its release.

Not the perfect adaptation, but a fine one overall.",1433808000,,4989,4.954599761051374

784775,3,6304109318,"I'm with the critics on this one. But I loved the settings, photography, and mood and so that balances out lacklustre dialogue, direction, and acting. It is worth sticking it out to see Malkovich's sinister face and the scenes that involve the kitchen staff and the wonderful grimy street scenes.

Other than that, for me at least, the story dragged somewhat tediously. Julia Roberts hardly acted, whereas she might have and that would have only improved the film. Her inner conflicts did leave room for some character development that just seemed missing. Malkovich also seemed largely to be just reciting his lines most of the time. The creepy music was a bit boring to the point of being slightly distracting. Yet the overall mood was well-done creepy all things considered.

Sorry fans, I just did not see it as you did. ""Julia's most powerful performance"" it says on the case. I simply can't see it that way.",1360108800,,913,4.808917197452229

784779,4,6304109318,"I recall this movie being advertised many years back and it was a different world back then. There were fewer channels so ads on the main networks were very expensive, and that meant this young actress had made it with the executive brass,as this type of advertising was expensive. At the time I was in a series of small towns,and wasn't able to see this film. I remember this actress from movies only,although in later years saw her appear in shows i watched like law and order(where she had a relationship with a star) and friends(maybe and marlo thomas well...maybe her too i forget). Anyways at this time she struck it big, and this theme of this movie,having dealt with woman issues for many years I found interesting. The movie with the Dickens fog and all,
is really about the abuse suffered by this chambermaid relayed to us through dreams and nightmares,as traumas revisited,and the males who think they have sexual desires but really have dreams of torture and confinement,the character
also has thoughts of confinement. It is a psychological thriller of sorts...although it does entertain. The character given her traumas is
incapable of forming relationships,and in that sense the film is well done
and true to life as things develop the way we think a character like her should develop. What I find interesting about this tale of victorian times,is the disordered world in which all the key characters inhabit,the doctor mr hyde and the traumatized patient...living the nightmares. Although it seems an odd choice to put this star in asa vehicle,Pretty Woman would make her a fixture for many years and to this day throughout the world. Her best role and film is probably My best friends wedding, and many of her films can actually be shown to younger pre teen girls and they would enjoy them...why quantify films as per age level such scientific standards are meaningless. This film is not appropriate for younger viewers,but certainly some of her other more cinderella/fairytale type roles certainly are. I put off watching this film for many years finding it odd in her career,but now find it interesting and its subject matter I finally comprehend more at an older age..",1332028800,,2187,4.9135135135135135
784875,3,6304109318,"Not a bad movie; just not a very good one. This serving girl  centered version of the Jekyll and Hyde version just doesn't make it. When you have a tradition which includes Barrymore, March and Tracy, to mention only the best known of the genre, you have class acts to live up to: this one doesn't make out. Its a pallid reorientation from J&H to the maid servant and it just doesn't work very well. Much of the time, Julia Roberts, the maid servant does what no maid servant would do and doesn't do what most maid servants would do. Much of the time, also, she is made so unglamorous, that it is difficult to  understand just why both J & H fall for her. As to the lead role, little horror, little disgust and fear, are generated by the quite unmonsterlike Hyde.
All-in- all, a decent but not enticing film.",1323648000,,808,4.344370860927152
784876,2,6304109318,"Mary Reilly, 1996 film

The story begins with a woman washing the floor; it is dark before morning. A man talks to her. Next the woman is in the kitchen, then making a bed. An eel is butchered for cooking. This is the house of the physician Dr. Jekyll. He was out late to study, and made a discovery. Mary Reilly can read, unusual for a maid servant. We hear about the life of servants. [Why a white suit on Jekyll?] A new assistant, Mr. Edward Hyde, is hired; he is a remarkable young man. Mary Reilly tells about her childhood. The father's drinking turned him into another man. Dr. Jekyll gives her a letter to deliver personally to Mrs. Farraday, who runs a house for sports. Mary has a nightmare about her childhood. There is a dark and spooky atmosphere. [More padding to this movie.] Mary hears screams from a woman at night. ""Enough excitement for one evening?"" The butler cautions Mary about her behavior. [This movie moves slowly.]

Mary is sent to Mrs. Farraday, who complains about Edward Hyde (a body in a room). Dr. Jekyll will look into this matter. Mary looks into a book. She meets Edward Hyde. [Note the resemblance?] A hatless Mr. Hyde walks on the streets of London to a butcher shop. A young servant notices the resemblance of Mr. Hyde? A relation to the older man? Dr. Jekyll knows Mary did not break a tea cup. Mary's mother died, she arranges a burial. On the way back she meets Mr. Hyde on the street. Back home the servants are questioned by the police. Did she meet Mr. Danvers? Mary said she didn't meet Mr. Hyde. One morning she is surprised to find Mr. Hyde in the house! Hyde explains the result of Dr. Jekyll's experiments. Dr. Jekyll has a new request for his servant. Later, Mary gets a nasty surprise from Mr. Hyde. There is a fantastic scene in the laboratory, Hyde changes into Dr. Jekyll! Is this the end of Jekyll or Hyde?

There were other movies based on Robert Louis Stevenson's original story in the 1930s and 1940s. There were more dramatic and entertaining than this slow moving drama. Stevenson's story seems to be a parable about the dangers of alcohol, and drink that can turn a good man into a bad man. But alcohol is not the only substance to affect reason and emotion in a human. One reason to watch this adaption from Valerie Martin's book is the recreation of a Victorian household.",1320019200,,2335,4.489411764705882

784878,5,6304109318,"One of my top 5 all time favorite movies.... I haven't been able to get away from it... An excellent way of portraying the Jekyll and Hyde persona... They could not have found better candidates for the characters if they tried, John Malkovich and Julia Roberts are perfect for these rolls I couldn't see anyone else in their respective parts... The suspense was wonderful yet slightly frustrating through the entire movie I just kept wanting to see more of the romantic aspect between Jekyll and Reilly, although it would have ruined the romantic tension and thus a very large part of the movie...

The only real problem I have had with this movie is the fact that there are parts in the preview (which I saw many years ago, as well as many times since) which are not in the actual movie in which I would have loved to see in the dvd release of this movie... I doubt I am the only one who feels this way... Someone should really think about making another release of this film including the deleted scenes I have no doubt it would make some money!!!",1300147200,,1049,4.463541666666667
784879,5,6304109318,"This entire movie seems dreamlike to me - with the haunting violin emitting its folk song tune as if it were drifting on the fog that is ever present throughout the film. For me, this beautifully disturbing film is really about Julia Roberts' character working through the pain and abuse her father has caused rather than a true love story, or story about Jekyll/Hyde. Mary Reilly is attracted to both Jekyll and Hyde and continues to do the strange and dangerous errands he asks her to rather than refusing because she is so uncomfortable doing them. The result is exposing a surprising and complicated duality to Mary Reilly as well the obvious one we all know about for Jekyll/Hyde. An additional result is also a positive one - at the end she has experienced true love (and to some extent sympathy, which is perhaps connected to the forgiveness she has for both her father and Jekyll/Hyde) for someone so unworthy of it, and also allowed herself to receive it (love), which is not something she has experienced as an adult woman yet (due to the horrible abuse she suffered at the hands of her father), even though the ending is only happy in that she is able to leave. I love this strong yet completely vulnerable and self-conscious character Roberts has portrayed, and truly feel that this role is one of the most interesting and insightful of any character Roberts has played before. And of course, Malkovich, Glenn Close, George Cole, and Michael Gambon are phenomenal. I also enjoyed seeing Michael Sheen in this role so early in his movie career.",1292025600,3,1555,4.74169741697417
784880,5,6304109318,"I highly recommend this movie.  Julia Roberts plays an excellent character as Mary Reilly, a very sensitive and tormented young lady whom Doctor Jekyll finds he is attracted to yet stands back and does nothing.  As usual, John Malkovich, who plays Jekyll and Hyde is superb and quite attractive as Mr. Hyde. This is the best version that I have seen of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The music is haunting and goes very well with the movie.",1283212800,2,434,4.551282051282051

A fine, fabulous performence from John Malkovich, a fine flesh and blood of a true artist and actor indeed.

784884,4,6304109318,"I am glad to see other reviewers praising this ""underrated""  film. I figured I was the only person who actually liked it, but I guess not. All the national critics sure hated this low-key retelling of Jekyll and Hyde.  Despite critics' comments to contrary, I found this an intelligent adaptation of the famous story.

The muted colors with the grey overtones caught my eye and were very interesting to observe. Julia Roberts also was interesting to watch: no makeup, no smile, just sad, somber looks yet still appealing.
People don't care for subtly in films anymore. They want in-your-face smash-ups, gore, violent conflicts....and a lot of it. This movie is extremely low-key.

I have to admit that it's hard to believe Roberts' character ""Mary Reilly"" would not recognize Jekyll from Hyde (played by John Malkovich) when he didn't change facial appearances! And, yes, the film, generally-speaking, is a real downer. Yet, for some odd reason, despite the above paragraph, I recommend the film to people who enjoy slower films and slow suspense, even if they have to suspend a little believability. I thought it was oddly fascinating.",1237334400,2,1136,5.0588235294117645
784944,5,6304109318,"Mary Reiley, masterfully played by Julia Roberts and Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde brilliantly performed by John Malkovich is a suspenseful recreation of the split personality of a man who has an inner evil twin who takes the lives of others as he experiences rage and the desire to control.

If you know the background of the original work by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, you know that it is about split personalities, surfacing the fact that within each of us there is the possibility of good and evil and that every human being, if all virtue is removed [kindness, compassion, love, hope, charity, faith] is capable of committing atrocities and go back to animal instincts.

The duality we find in ourselves, if not dealt with in an effort to understand our faults, may create personalities that project evil onto others, surfacing anger, rage, depression and lack of self esteem. Humans that do not deal with their inner demons end displaying an outward respectability that is nothing but social hypocrisy that masks a tendency for inner sins, whether these be lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy or pride.

The movie is set in London and the plot for the most part, takes place in the mansion, with an intuitive and inquisitive Mary Reiley providing her interpretation of the conflict experienced by Dr. Jekyll. Mary Reiley suffered greatly as a child in the hands of an abusive father and as such, she understands the evil within others and how harmful it was to her, therefore, how harmful it is to those that Mr. Hyde encounters during the night.

The plot scenes are set in dark places, Mary Reiley is asked to visit houses of ill repute, where Glenn Close plays the part of the ""madam"" who will permit Dr. Jekyll to engage in all sorts of evil acts as long as he pays a good price.

We get the feeling that Mary Reiley ends loving her kind employer, the first man to ever protect and confide in her, and that through this love and acceptance of his good and evil, she inspires the evil side to put an end to all suffering. If you like mystery, suspense, horror and dark romance, this is a movie for you! While not our favorite type movie, we were thrilled by the performances. Don't miss it!",1234656000,2,2210,4.641943734015345
784945,3,6304109318,"I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out in 1996, and have to admit that at the time, it didn't leave much of an impression. I'm a reader of classic literature, and was familiar enough with Robert Louis Stevenson's original masterpiece, though I have never read the modern adaptation by Valerie Martin, on which this movie is largely based. I'm not one of the purists who gets bent out of shape if a movie deviates all that much from a written source, provided the source is fictional, and the movie well-done in it's own right. I actually appreciated the twist of telling the classic Jeckyll-Hyde story from the viewpoint of a woman, as this was particularly absent in Stevenson's original work.

I picked up a copy of the DVD the other day (not sure why), and after watching this little-known, atmospheric movie again the other night, have decided that it's better the second time around. Maybe that's the better way to judge most movies after all: some clearly blow you away with the first viewing, but many films like that, when viewed again after the distance of many years, lose their luster- ""Mary Reilly"" is the other way around for me. Watching it again after 12 years, I appreciated many aspects of the movie that just slipped by me the first time.

For one, while much has been made of the ""miscasting"" of Julia Roberts, and her on-again, off-again Irish accent in this film, I think it's actually one of her better acting performances. I'm not a fan of Robert's, mainly because the bulk of her movies involve precious little serious acting: most of the time she is just asked to look pretty. ""Mary Reilly"" (where she is a house servant to the troubled Dr. Jeckyll- John Malkovich- in 1885 London) is the only movie of hers I have seen where her body is not primarily on display. Wearing period attire throughout the film, and with generally no makeup to embellish her face (which actually looks somewhat scarred and even haggard in many scenes), she manages to convey Mary's conflicting emotions very well.....she clearly has a fondness for Dr. Jeckyll, and conveys both fear and paradoxical attraction to the malevolent Hyde without being given all that much to say. Some real acting going on here, and while some just call this miscasting, I appreciated a side of this actress that I've not seen on display before. Her 50:50 success with the Irish accent didn't bother me as much as it apparently did for many other reviewers: at least she tried. Odd that no one gets on Malkovich (a superb actor, particularly in menacing roles like Hyde) for NEVER attempting the same. What bothered me more about Malkovich's character was not the lack of any attempt to make Hyde physically much different from Jeckyll (which many thought was hilariously thin), but the fact that Hyde's voice was NO different than Jeckyll's, other than being given more disturbing things to say. In any event, kudos to Julia Roberts for going ""outside-the-box"" in this role. Perhaps her role in ""Michael Collins"" came close to this, with a similarly subdued performance, including the accent.

The main theme of the movie is of course well-known to fans of Stevenson's work, and my only complaint here is I wish the screenwriters had gone a little deeper with Malkovich's character, and given him a few more lines and a little more screen time by himself, to explore the timeless theme of good and evil within the heart of every man. A little less time dwelling on Julia Roberts face, and a little more with glimpses into Jeckyll's torment would have worked better.

The costumes and sets to recreate Victorian London were well-done, though the squalor of the back streets and the forboding atmospheric fog were only given a small role in the film- and at times the interior lighting effects were at odds with the candle-light era: a bit too bright at times, when darkness, fog, and obscurity would not only have been more realistic, but more effective.

The musical score, which totally escaped my attention the first time I saw this film, adds nicely to the tension leading up to Mary's discovery of Jeckyll's secret. It's an understated soundtrack, so you won't find yourself humming bars from it months later- but it clearly adds to the atmosphere of the film, and never detracts from a scene.

The pacing of the movie is deliberately slow, and the violence brief, never gratuitous, and largely implied. But, at 108 minutes, I never felt the movie dragged unnecessarily. Just about right.

I give ""Mary Reilly"" 3 stars overall. My measure of a movie's worth is whether I would watch it more than once, and whether it holds it's entertainment value after a number of years. In this respect, ""Mary Reilly"" comfortably measures up. Not a classic, but worth viewing.

I'll take it over ""Pretty Woman"" anyday. Well, if I'm in the mood, anyway.....",1229558400,,4845,4.780167264038232
784946,4,6304109318,This is a well acted and directed alternative version of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde classic tale.  It does have some graphic scenes which would make it unsuitable for younger children.  It is one of John Malkovich's best acting as the characters that he portrays are believable.,1216166400,,279,4.791666666666667
784947,3,6304109318,"Re-telling a classic tale from a new perspective, usually courtesy of a relatively minor character from the original work, is an old and in some cases dubious literary tradition. It has been undertaken with deliciously successful results in, say, The Return of Moriarty, by John Gardner, or has fallen shamefully flat: Donald McCaig's recent Rhett Butler's People comes to mind.

The 1996 film Mary Reilly is the lukewarm but not charmless on-screen adaptation of the superior 1990 ""alternate history"" novel by the acclaimed Valerie Martin, who in penning her tale drew on Robert Louis Stevenson's magnum opus, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. In the film as in the novel, Mary Reilly, an Irish maidservant far from home and melancholy, lately given work in the household of one Dr Henry Jekyll, a London gentleman and medical researcher in the year 1885, forms a friendship of sorts with her dual-natured employer, and stands in as a background figure in the events described to greater effect in the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

Inexplicable mega-star Julia Roberts is passable here and courageously attempts an Irish accent with moderate success--hey, I can't do one well, either, Julia, and trust me, I've tried---while John Malkovich, not quite the Dr. Jekyll the original author described, is still enjoyably creepy in this role. Though the murders in this movie are largely implied and committed off-screen, there's a compensatory scene in which a tub full of fresh-caught eels meet their maker in the Jekyll kitchen and that should churn even the toughest stomachs.

Fans of the Stevenson novel tend to either love this second take on the old tale or else recoil at the ballsy blasphemy of what Martin and film maker Christopher Hampton (Atonement) did. For those who loved the movie, I say please read the much-better novel. And for those fans of Stevenson's original who sneered at the movie, I'd note here that Valerie Martin's book is a much more a case of loving tribute to the nineteenth-century masterpiece than Hampton's motion picture.",1204156800,3,2106,5.045977011494253

She can't hold a stead Irish accent-- at times she sounds like good old American Julia, and at other times, a VERY strong Irish accent comes out of her mouth, with no explanation for the sudden change.  I believe this must have been a critical point in her career, at which point someone must have told her, ""stick with what you do well... romantic comedies!""",1184198400,7,611,4.419642857142857

There's one thing missing that's in all the movies I mentioned, and that's Julia's laughter. That laugh of hers as far as I'm concerned has become her trademark. Actors and Actresses all have a trademark as far as I'm concerned. George Burns always and forever had a stogey in his mouth, Groucho Marx always with those wire-rimmed glasses, and Julia Roberts with her laugh. However, don't think because she doesn't laugh in this movie that means it isn't good, on the contrary this shows her ability to drop her Georgian accent, and trade it for an almost Irish accent, but it also shows her ability to act in crossover films which prepared her for an I believe an Oscar nomination for supporting actress for the film ""Stepmom"". The story line I will have to look into this further, and see if Robert Louis Stevenson had a character named Mary Reilly in his story ""Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde"".

784952,4,6304109318,"This movie has an interesting twist on the classic horror film. We are able to watch what transpires within the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the view of a chambermaid's perspective. This chambermaid, Mary Reilly, is played quite well by Julia Roberts. Mary Reilly is a poor girl who had a horrible childhood and feels the safety of security brought about by working in the house of a rich and distinguished doctor. Of course unlike normal servants of the time, she is able to read and becomes very inquisitive about her masters business. Mr. John Malkovich does a perfect job of showing the ongoing conflict between good and evil contained within each of us in his portrayal of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. As the good doctor he is a kindly man of science. But as Mr. Hyde all his inhabitations are gone, as are his morals and conscience.

This film takes the horror film and turns into a film that keeps you suspended in the dark as you watch the mystery unfold for the chambermaid. The movie is not a true classic horror film or one of the modern films of gore. Do not expect to be frighten and do not be surprised when the audience seems to be the only ones that can see it is obvious that Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde. Other then that, both leads give a satisfactory performance and the film is worth watching.",1169596800,4,1313,4.403292181069959

I feel I lost brain cells just watching it.  The only ""scary"" or ""disturbing"" part was Malkovich's face, which hardly ever changed into a believable expression.  Robert's accent changed from scene to scene with upsetting regularity, which was extremely disappointing.

If the point of this movie was to show how ""misunderstood"" Jeckyl and Hyde may have been, it did a thoroughly awful job.

I would recommend a root canal over this movie, as it may be less painful.",1140393600,6,611,4.893203883495145
785011,3,6304109318,"As far as filmmaking goes, this production only deserves 2 stars. However, because its classic Jekyll & Hyde source material (with its dark Freudian roots that reach into the subject of substance abuse) and the gloomy Jack-the-Ripper-in-London time period are so universally compelling, the movie is somewhat engrossing without really being effective.

I haven't read the novel on which MARY REILLY is based, but you can see the framework is there for a striking work. As the heroine is a lowly servant in the mysterious Dr. Jekyll's home, there's an element of spying involved that heightens the tension, and the role of women in Victorian times is a rich dramatic subject in itself. (Mary has few options in life and is forever treading on thin ice. When she risks listening outside her employer's door, it's a very different situation than if you or I were doing the same today.) There are no significant female characters in Stevenson's original novella, almost as if they weren't worth writing about, and telling the story from a female viewpoint opens the door for new layers of perspective.

A huge problem is that Stephen Frears fails to sustain an atmosphere that's either realistically grisly or theatrically horrifying. For one thing, although the occasional fog bank is rolled out, the lighting seems all wrong. When Mary hears noises in the night and creeps downstairs to investigate, the stairwell is lit with warm, honeyish light as if this were a sunny morning. (I don't know if this lighting is intended to flatter the actress playing Mary or not, but its as false and distracting as the clear polish that glimmers on her nails from time to time.) This sort of choice may seem minor, yet it completely undermines any air of menace. This same insensitivity to mood arises in the costuming, which is correct in its detailing but also brand-spanking-new. (When the impoverished Mary runs a scary errand, she wears a neat, sweeping tweed coat that would be perfectly at home in a Brooks Brothers or Burbury shop window today.)

These details aside, what truly derails the film is the fact that its stars don't share any chemistry. Julia Roberts is a natural sensualist while John Malkovich is coolly cerebral, and at least here, the opposites don't attract. It's also frustrating that, for some intellectual reason that may have appealed to Mr. Malkovich more than anyone else, Jekyll and Hyde aren't made to look very different. (Hyde basically looks like Jekyll with a hangover, and in need of a haircut.) This central conceit is completely jarring, and pretty much renders the drama ridiculous.

MARY REILLY was originally to be produced with Tim Burton (who ultimately chose to do ED WOOD instead) directing Winona Ryder. In this case, the idea of what might have been is far more exciting than what we finally get.",1137888000,,2832,4.94327731092437
785012,4,6304109318,"This was a surprise, as I didn't think Julia Roberts would ever attempt something serious and certainly not as intellectual as a costume drama.  Her accent is a little hoaky, but she actually did a pretty good job here and I wish this movie was more acknowledged than it is as this is one of (if not the) few on her resume that has substance.

Instead of the traditional Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde journal entries and lab experiements, we see the good doctor falling apart from his chamber maid's perspective.  Mary Reilly, a controlled, obedient woman, is busy about the house while a mysterious stranger seems to float in and out of the house.  Eventually the stranger as well as the doctor (John Malcovich) take a shine to her.  Both find her attractive, no question, but they're both fascinated by her and what a mystery she is.  It follows the story of Jekyll and Hyde from an outsider's point of view (Mary's), and how a man is going mad with abuse of power.  Glen Close even has a cameo which was all too brief.",1128038400,,1015,4.454054054054054
785013,4,6304109318,"In the great tradition of Gothic horror films, Mary Reilly updates the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novella, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  The screenplay by Christopher Hampton, from the novel by Valerie Martin, changes the focus from the bizarre transformation of Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde, his evil alterego, and creates instead a tension-filled relationship between the dark and ""misunderstood"" Dr. Jekyll and his young and proper housemaid, Mary Reilly.  Despite (or perhaps because of) the abuse she has suffered at the hands of her father, Mary does not run from Dr. Jekyll, though she always seems fearful.  He confides in her about his research and gives her a sense of value which she does not receive from any other source.

Julia Roberts as the very repressed Mary, plays most of the film through her expressive eyes, which reveal her fear and her moods.  Little dialogue is necessary, as John Malkevich, as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, sneers, threatens, and dissembles, while also conveying a vulnerability to which Mary Reilly responds.  The cast of other house servants is outstanding, but Glenn Close as the off-the-wall madam Mrs. Farraday, steals the show, playing the role in her nastiest Cruella DeVille mode.  The Victorian setting is beautifully conveyed, from the claustrophic interiors of the bawdy house to the stark black and white interior of Jekyll's laboratory, and the costuming reflects the same color palette.

The cinematography takes advantage of architectural components, filming from above catwalks in Dr. Hyde's laboratory, through windows, around doorways and halls, and from under tables.  Additional scenes of dark, foggy weather are used to great advantage as a contrast to the brightness and butchery in the markets, hospital autopsy rooms, and Mrs. Farraday's accommodations.

The psychological portrait of Dr. Jekyll and his ""evil twin,"" Mr. Hyde have been discussed for over a hundred years, and this film does not add anything new to that portrait.  The inclusion of Mary Reilly, however, is a new twist, one which might have been more believable if her own psychological motivation for remaining in Dr. Jekyll's household had been more fully developed.  The special effects as Dr. Jekyll wrestles with his inner demon are compelling and unique, but the ending just peters out, offering no emotional resolution or intellectual conclusion regarding Mary Reilly. Great fun for fans of Gothic horror.  Mary Whipple",1104796800,11,2455,5.248081841432225

No!
One is never quite sure who is to blame for all the missed opportunities here; whether the studio wanted to make one film and the director another, or whether director Stephen Frears just made bad choices, but this movie never quite jells.  Indecision seems to plague it at almost every turn.  When it should be scarey, it settles for being merely creepy.  When it should be creepy, it is merely weird.  When it should be suspenseful, it goes conventional.
Julia Roberts seems more constrained in this picture than Winnona Rider and Sadie Frost do in their corsets in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula.""  She stays in her ""wounded bird"" persona throughout the entire film.  The trouble is we are given no preamble to explain why should be that way, and no development to explain why she should stay that way.
John Malkovich, ever the unconventional actor, makes an astounding choice with his character, choosing to play Dr. Jekyll
not as the obsessed mad scientist we're so familiar with, but as a doomed Byronic romantic.  His Mr. Hyde is just the flip side of that doomed romanticism, blatently sexual, full of spontaneous, unrestrained libido.  It's a brilliant choice.  If
Frears had picked up this cue and run with it, we would have had an interesting film about the ""fallen angel syndrome"" which has been the bane of the dating scene for the last 50 years.  Some of the single women in the audience might have actually stopped asking: ""Where are all the good men?"" long enough to ask themselves: ""Why am I always so attracted to bad boys?""  Alas!
Hollywood today is either incapable or unwilling to make a movie that asks its audience to think!
So, instead we get a film which can never make up its mind whether it wants to be a horror movie, a ""doomed love"" story or a ""Julia Roberts vehicle.""  By trying to be all three at once, it fails to be any of the above.

You can deeply feel Julia's pain , passion and fright. Mary Reilly (Julia Roberts ) and her Employer they both has fractures in their souls and they start to get closer to each other when they begin to know more about each other.""As Mary Reilly interprets it, this is not a classic conflict between good and evil -- life isn't that simple. Hyde does not represent the distillation of pure evil, just as Jekyll is not a paragon of righteousness. Each has virtues and flaws, and only together do they represent a whole person. Hyde is raw emotion -- the animal side of humanity. His passion, twisted though it may be, gives Jekyll the will to live. Through the dichotomy presented by these two characters, we are challenged to consider that perhaps it's the combination of good and evil, control and liberation, and restraint and passion that makes each of us who we are. Mary Reilly has the power to disturb because it forces us to look inside and recognize our own Jekylls and Hydes.
By using Mary as the main character, this film is also able to illustrate the transforming power of love. To be sure, Mary Reilly isn't a conventional romance, but it's a love story nevertheless. Mary loves Jekyll for his goodness, and Hyde for what she sees of herself mirrored in him. When Jekyll speaks of having a fractured soul, Mary understands his pain. Her own spirit has been crippled by her childhood torture at the hands of an abusive father (Michael Gambon). Moreover, Hyde's feelings for Mary prove to be his undoing. In the end, her gift to him is indescribably precious.
Mary Reilly triumphs because of superlative character interaction. John Malkovich, who has played just about every kind of role in his varied career, brings a different slant to his Jekyll/Hyde portrayal. His Jekyll is a tragic figure of Shakespearean proportions; his Hyde is less a monster than a misanthrope. Meanwhile, opposite Malkovich, Julia Roberts graces the screen with a tender, beautifully understated performance that dwarfs anything she has previously done. Mary is both strong and vulnerable, and Roberts, looking convincingly frumpy and uncertain, creates a poignant, tormented character. Her work here is truly eye-opening.
I suspect that many who see Mary Reilly will get a completely different movie than they're expecting. Instead of murder and mayhem (although both of these are evident), we are presented with a beautifully-textured motion picture tapestry that focuses on characters and themes rather than gory special effects. Mary Reilly is haunting, not only because of its foggy, shadowy settings, but because of the questions it encourages us to ask about ourselves and others.""",1081814400,4,3116,4.899621212121212
785079,5,6304109318,"As a fan of what I have heard called gothic novels - Bronte, Dickens, etc. - I have got to put in a word for this movie.  This is a phenomenal movie.  The story centers around Julia Roberts' character, Mary Reilly, who is a servant of Dr. Jekyll.  John Malkovich plays a wonderful Dr. Jekyll and makes Mr. Hyde into a fascinating villain. He catches the essence of Mr. Hyde perfectly in my mind...a mysterious and diabolical yet somewhat alluring presence though unstable. (In the original Stevenson story Hyde's dominant characteristic was the repugnance he pulled from people when they saw him - as if he was deformed in some way though it was not visible.  It is implied that evil deforms the soul and that visible to other's by instinct). As Reilly assists Jekyll, their relationship becomes that of confidantes (though Jekyll is holding back). He develops an interest in Mary and her life. As he delves into her psyche, he forms a definite affection for her and she for him. There is a certain tension between them because of their feelings, their differing social positions and the problems that Jekyll is having but can't fully explain to the timid but reliable Mary Reilly.
This movie was so strong, it just blew me away.  It is what I had hoped that Stevenson's story would be but wasn't.  I have put Mary Reilly, the book, on my reading list and I fully expect it to be every bit the powerful work as Jane Eyre with the special flavor of horror to be found in the likes of Shelley's Frankenstein.",1076716800,5,1506,4.5799256505576205

The whole thing is stunning and Julia perfectly moves with  grace and understanding of her role! I had read the novel by Valerie Martin  upon which the movie is based and I must say that Frears, the director, was  able to make a perfect adaptation for the big screen.

She gave a sensitive dramatic performance in this artistic film which takes the  classic tale of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (played superbly by John Malkovich)  in a different perspective - in the eyes of his faithful lady servant,  Mary, played by Roberts. Also, in the film is a hilarious participation of  Glenn Close. I recommend this movie for serious fans of Julia Roberts.  Great Film!",964137600,18,444,4.7894736842105265

I fell in love!  Julia Roberts has been one  of my favorite actresses since ""Steel Magnolias"".  I had never  really watched John Malkovich before.  I fell in love with his acting  abilities in this movie.  I think never before had I noticed such a  complete change in an actor from one character to another in one movie.  After seeing ""Mary Reilly"", I ran to Blockbuster searching for  John Malkovich films.  I admit that some of them aren't so great, but you  must see this one!",962841600,5,655,4.341666666666667
785157,3,6304109318,"Sorry to whoever said it was great to see Julia Roberts in a ""humble"" role, but in the long run that only added to the unbelievability of the film. The pitiful excuse of an accent (don't they  have coaches for that sort of thing?) is just icing on the cake. The sets,  Glen Close, and John Malkovich are all wonderful, and with any other  actress (and a better ending!) this film might have gotten off the ground.  However, one look at the wet puppy dog eyes and gaping maw of Julia  Roberts, even without makeup, and everyone else, no matter how brilliant  they are normally, might as well be wearing a shirt which says: ""I was  in a chick-flick star-vehicle for Julia Roberts and all they gave me was  this lousy t-shirt."" C'mon, folks, she's lovable fluff and that's  about it. There's a reason most of her characters have names like Traci,  Candy, and Babs and the one film with serious social implications (Sleeping  with the Enemy) ended up as a song and dance number touting her  indefatigable cuteness.",953856000,3,1010,4.581005586592179
785158,5,6304109318,"This film happens to be a peculiar favorite of mine primarily because the setting, music, and cinematography set the overall haunting atmosphere of the film. Everything about the atmosphere is overshadowing. The film seems  to mold the setting as an additional character by accenting the actions of  Jekyll, Hyde,and Mary. A particular scene that catches my attention  everytime is when Mary plants the flowers in the backyard, and soon  afterward the vibrant colors of the flowers do no help ""enliven"" the space.  This is the main reason for why I enjoyed the film because it demonstrates  how enviornment forshadows the dangerous activities of the Doctor. However,  I do acknowledge there are aspects of the film that are not as strong. There  are parts of the film that both distracte, and fascinate me.
The only  weak point for me in watching the film is the lack of control in the Irish  ""accent"" from Julia Roberts that filters in and out frequently throughout  the film.  The acting from the cast is good. John Malkovich's performance  was great and as always with a suave seduction that isn't unfamiliar from  his previous works. I was surprised however by Julia Robert's portrayal of  Mary Reilly. I have never seen Roberts play a character that wasn't  ""glamorous"" to some degree. Mary Reilly is a strong character that has  survived abuse, and lived out a good life. I feel that Roberts did convey  the sadness and curiosity of the character Mary.
Overall, this film is  an enjoyable film, but not a masterpiece or classic. It is a film that is  filled with dark corridors, shadows, and fog, all of which add to the story  and plight of the principal characters.",951350400,14,1673,4.840989399293286
785159,1,6304109318,"The film had the POTENTIAL to be another Dangerous Liasons; but the onscreen chemistry between Malkovich and Julia Roberts failed. Perhaps, Malkovich heart was not in it; which completely showed throughout the film.  Indeed, it was double role that he offered onscreen; displaying a lack of  creativity; and hopelessness. Perhaps, it was the added pressure of  re-creating a masterpiece; regardless, the film made no great leaps and  jumps; instead it was stagnant with no beauty.",945388800,4,480,5.36
785160,5,6304109318,"I didn't rush to see this film because it got a fairly luke-warm reception from critics.  Among other things, they complained that there was little chemistry between the two leads.  Clearly, I do not understand critics'  perception of chemistry, because if there had been any more heat between  Malkovich and Roberts, my VCR would have melted.  Their ability to  communicate feelings nonverbally combined with a slow and steady increase  in sexual tension created one of the best film experiences I have had in  recent years.
Others complained about Roberts' accent.  This did not  bother me.  An argument could be made that her irregular Irish accent was  the result of living in aristocratic British households for 10 years.  She  would have started to lose her accent by that point.  Was it that  calculated by Roberts?  Probably not--but it still flies.
My only  criticism of this otherwise remarkable film, is what I suspect was an  over-zealous use of editing scissors.  We are spared being drawn a picture  of the implied incestuous relationship between Mary and her father.  Fine,  we more than got the message and I for one, was happy to not have to  witness such a horror.  But when Mary enters the brothel and finds carnage,  including blood on the ceiling and a disemboweled rat, Glenn Close's Mrs.  Farraday says, ""Don't even ask.""  But we have to ask.  There  isn't enough information to go on.  What triggered Hyde's rage?  What  association, if any, did he make between the prostitute, Mary and her story  about rats?  Later, we're left to wonder what triggered Hyde's murderous  rage regarding Sir Danvers Carew.  Then, in the scene in which Hyde and  Mary look about to consumate their relationship, we don't know if that  happens.  Seeing this would not have been gratuitous.  It would have  furthered our understanding of Mary's dark-side and of Hyde's struggle with  his love for her.  In fact, we haven't got a clue what happened.  In  perhaps the most blatant example, we (or at least I ) cannot begin to  imagine under what circumstances Hyde would have sent her for the antecdote  or why he was in such a state when she slid it into the room.  This isn't  asking the audience to draw conclusions, it's asking us to write scenes.  The director and/or writer should have filled in those blanks.  It would  have more than held our interest.
In the end, however, Mary Reilly is the  kind of film that allows us to live vicariously through the characters.  We  care about what happens to them, and when we leave, it makes us think about  the Jekyl and Hyde in all of us.  That's what great film-making is all  about.",928800000,4,2636,4.754464285714286

Both of the personalities he played were very  sexy.  The only downfall of the movie was Julia Roberts fake Irish accent.  Sometimes it would be too strong, and other times it was practically  non-existent.  Either way, it was a great movie!!
