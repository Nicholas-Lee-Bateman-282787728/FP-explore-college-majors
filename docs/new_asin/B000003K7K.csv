Teleplay by: Philip Lazebnik
Story bu: Ira Steven Behr & James Crocker
Directed by: Avery Brooks
The third season of Star Trek Deep Space Nine surprises us again by it's uneven nature as it introduces an episode that's probably as bad as you can get with star trek.
It's a discusting waste of the quest characters Lwaxana Troi and the family of Miles O'Brien. By the way, Miles's and Keiko's marrital crisis creates a misplaced and clumsy sub-plot to the episode.
By it's main plot, ""Fascination"" is like a bad porn film with all the X-rated stuff cut out of it. A weird condition takes over the main characters and they start feeling irresistable sexual attraction towards each other.
Yes, I'm afraid that once again it's every bit as bad as it sounds, as the characters get abused in horribly written scenes, with only Terry Farrel making it through with maintained credibility while the acting in general devolves into soap-opera quality performances that follow the style of the whole boring episode, wich is like a sensured porn film with plot, combined with Baywatch and teenage soap opera.",1010016000,2,1123,4.91578947368421
