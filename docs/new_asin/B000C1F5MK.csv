When my granddaughter came along it was time to teach her some values about work and sharing etc in a fun way she could relate.  At 2yrs of age she was dancing to the soundtrack and squealing with delight.  I found the video and she was even more thrilled seeing those talking horse.  I would recommend this video to everyone, but alas, they are hard to find since they don't seem to be produced anymore.  If you can find one, grab it.  Heck, I sing along!",1372377600,,596,4.267857142857143
