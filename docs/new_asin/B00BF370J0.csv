8567565,4,B00BF370J0,"This is a two-hour documentary by National Geographic draws the closest conclusion of why the Hunley sank.  Earlier conclusions were based by diving reports only.  By the time of this documentary however, the Hunley had been brought to the surface and then to a lab where it could be examined more closely.  Yet, I somehow felt that this latest conclusion or theory of the sinking is flawed by several questions that come to mind whilst viewing it.  Without telling you their conclusion outright, I would say that deductive thinking will raise the very same questions in your mind and they all focus upon the hatch.  You would be well-advised to watch this documentary after first viewing the 1999 film with Assante and Southerland.  Doing so will help to bring beter focus whilst watching the NG documentary.  There are two other documentaries available, but this one is by far the best of the lot.",1472860800,3,899,4.836601307189542

8567569,5,B00BF370J0,"The H.L. Hunley Submarine was the first combat submarine to sink an enemy warship (the USS Housatonic) in 1864, but the Hunley did not survive that attack, took her 8 man crew to the bottom with her, and was lost for over 100 years.  My wife and I have been fascinated by the details of this story since we read the Wikipedia article a few months ago and this video provided a wealth of information, including the very latest discoveries as of February 2013.

Few written records of the Hunley remain, but since she was recovered in 2000, archaeologists have learned much about her mission, construction, and crew.  Maybe by 2020 they will have enough new information to release a third updated video, but until then, this is the Hunley video to watch (the Hunley will be in a cleaning bath for the next 6 years).  The earlier National Geographic video, ""Raising the Hunley"" captures the excitement and details of actually recovering her from the ocean floor, but I found the story of the Hunley's original mission and the investigations they are using to piece together that story to be much more interesting than the retrieval.

The ballistics segment is particularly exciting, but what captivates me about the Hunley is the story of 8 men who were willing to squeeze themselves into a home-made sardine can that had sunk twice before, put an explosive charge on the end of it, and pump it 4 miles into the ocean in the dark and cold without any supplementary air or power to attack an enemy ship.  Technology on the edge in desperate times.",1389398400,20,1543,4.675276752767528
