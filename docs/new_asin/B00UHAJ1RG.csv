7040657,2,B00UHAJ1RG,"I didn't laugh. It's a fine movie, but it's a drama--kind of a bummer drama. It should not be listed as a comedy, any more than you would say Pi or Inherent Vice or Eraserhead were comedies--they were all interesting movies too--but total bummers and definitely not comedies. I could see where the pitch, as a stand-up routine, might have sounded funny, but the film is way too real, too nihilistic, and too hopeless for anyone but a teen to be able to laugh off. Maybe it's me--maybe I've lost my sense of humor. Just one funny scene--I would have settled for that, man. You know, I think I did laugh at parts of Eraserhead--but I was a teenager then.",1436486400,5,652,4.441666666666666

unwatchableReally really badThin plot, and Adam's neurotic/loser persona is not
the least bit interesting or likableI simply stopped caring about his character about a

7040662,1,B00UHAJ1RG,A really bad movie! Goldberg's character spends the first 30 minutes or so talking self absorbed adolescent gibberish and he's a 40 year old man. Time to move on...,1437350400,,164,4.689655172413793

7040666,5,B00UHAJ1RG,"No Way Jose was a great movie.  The music was beautiful and perfectly matched to the scenes.  I hope that we can purchase the music.

Adam Goldberg is a very versatile actor.  I loved seeing his excellent performance in this dramatic role and still laugh out loud funny in No Way Jose.",1436745600,,285,4.423076923076923

7040668,5,B00UHAJ1RG,"I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable indie movie. Goldberg, as a polymath, writes, directs, acts and makes music in this tour de force look at midlife crisis. I found it impressive and creative that he crafted most of the characters around actual friends of his. As usual he makes the most of his Woody Alllen like neurosis. Don't miss this one!",1436486400,3,350,4.571428571428571

8706863,5,B00UHAJ1RG,"Classic Goldberg. Dry, witty, great story and dialogue. Personal note, I like movies with depth. If you like movies that are made to be a story and not just things blowing up, give this a chance.",1445817600,,195,4.444444444444445
8706864,5,B00UHAJ1RG,"Really cool - funny - saw it a few months ago forgot to write a review, but I was so annoyed by ""They Came Together"" last night that I remembered that I never write reviews for movies I love, only movies I hate. So here I am - and this is a pretty good one. Def worth watching.",1445212800,,277,3.793103448275862

8706867,2,B00UHAJ1RG,"The trailer makes it look watchable, but the actual movie is pretty slow and doesn't go much anywhere.  My wife gave up after watching it for a half hour.  I made it through to the end because I paid for it.  It's shot pretty well, and the acting is okay, but it seems rather self involved.  I don't relate to the main character Jose, even though I'm male, near the same age, and live in LA.  I'm not sure how he can afford to live in Los Angeles by being in a band that plays kids birthdays parties, unless he's just mooching of his girlfriends and hitting his family up for money.  It doesn't really spoil anything either to say that the use the cliche ""I'm pregnant"" plot device twice in the movie.  Really, twice?  That's poor writing and a cheap out.  There's much better things to watch, let alone pay a few bucks to see.  Sometimes I've enjoyed watching movies that only get 2 starts, but this wasn't the case.  If someone asks if you want to watch this movie, you should say ""No Way Jose"".",1440374400,,997,4.278074866310161
8706868,1,B00UHAJ1RG,"one of the worst ever spent monies that I have ever spent. Its a woody allen esque movie..the female lead was awesome, but the guy and his friends need to never be in film again. yuck yuck yuck! don't waste time or money on this one.",1439596800,,233,4.086956521739131
8706869,1,B00UHAJ1RG,"Disappointing waste of money.

The trailer managed to create the impression that this movie might be amusing, so I give the trailer 3 stars. The movie was energetically wrong-headed, like a dog rolling in its own droppings. Well, maybe that's too strong. Let's just say I viscerally hated this movie even more than I despised ""The Fault in Our Stars"".",1438560000,,351,4.85
