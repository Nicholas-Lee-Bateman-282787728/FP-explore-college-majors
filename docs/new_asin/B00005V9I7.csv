1673190,5,B00005V9I7,Everyone has purpose and meaning in life.  This is the best movie that I have seen in years.  Great family movie ~ moral of the story...characters shine in this movie.,1251763200,5,167,4.533333333333333
1673191,5,B00005V9I7,"This is a Hallmark/Showtime made for TV movie adapted from the Novel by Garrison Keillor who also acted as a consultant for the movie. Norman is the father who dreams of conducting classical music and practices while shaving and managing his herd of dairy cows. Ingrid is the mother who gave up a promising musical career to marry Norman and live in the small community of Sandy Bottom, WI. She is also the town activist. Rachel is the 14 year old daughter who has inherited her mother's musical talent but can't find a place in school where all her friends are into girls' baseball and cheerleading. Can this out of place family find a way to connect with the rest of the townspeople or will they will be forever the joke of the community. This is a movie about life in a small town and the agony of growing up different. It's about family and friends and community and the problems and crises they experience. And it wouldn't be a Garrison Keillor story without a Lutheran Church that is somewhat dysfunctional about its music. While this could easily have turned out sappy and syrupy, it's quite satisfying emotionally and intellectually. It's definitely as family friendly as they come. No sex, no violence, one bad word that I can remember, it's a Hallmark film in their best tradition. Enjoy!! Lu G. for Lu's Reviews. [...]",1208563200,6,1329,4.683760683760684
1673192,5,B00005V9I7,"A good movie for kids and adults who have special talents, who stand alone in the crowd, to show them that they are not alone, and that they do have a place in this world.  It also makes points about true friendship, and how a dream can come true if you try hard enough and have enough faith in yourself. Also touches on the art of compromise. Great story line.",1186185600,3,361,4.1571428571428575
1673193,5,B00005V9I7,This movie is excellent because it focuses on everyday life instead of fantasy (like Hollywood usually does). I can wholly relate to the 2 main characters as I too am a classical pianist and violinist who has always been the outsider (sometimes the reason being because of my love of classical music). It is a great family movie and can help boost your spirits if you are an outsider as well as give you the engery that you need in order to keep going to make a difference inspite of what other people think.,1182556800,4,508,4.414893617021277
1673194,5,B00005V9I7,"A film from the heart. This is another one of those hidden

gems of a story. Great acting and scenes. If you love music, you will love this film. If you are not into music, the story will touch your heart. We need more movies like this.",1139356800,7,236,4.0212765957446805
1673195,5,B00005V9I7,"I enjoyed this immensely!  The story of culture in small-town, the wholesomeness of the family, friends.  The outcome of it all!
Music is such a universal language, here exemplified in Wisconsin Shady Bottom.
Acting is good.  Music is superb!  Cineamatography exquisite.  Such pastels and scenes!",1041292800,5,296,5.488888888888889
1673196,4,B00005V9I7,"A book-to-movie is not always easy and this movie has moments where it is not quite up to par with the book, but the underlying message still comes through.  It is a great story of the things we do, whether we want to or not, for the good of the whole and also of the ties that bind. Plus, Glenne Headley is a stitch as the matriarch Ingrid. Anyone who has ever felt insecure or out-of-place will appreciate this movie (and be glad it's not your family!).",1037491200,5,455,4.2298850574712645

1673198,5,B00005V9I7,"Heartwarming, family entertainment.  Not a Hollywood type movie.
A great reminder of what is important in life, the treasures and challenges we are given everyday... a wonderful movie to watch with kids who feel they are not fitting in...",1012608000,8,238,5.102564102564102

7956192,5,B00005V9I7,"This is a sweet and beautiful story that can be watched over and over. My whole family loved it and, over the years, we have gotten copies for our friends. The picture on the front of the DVD is surprising and, I think, misleading, as it basically has nothing to do with the movie. What does ""Sandy Bottom Orchestra"" tell us? If you want it, make it happen. Don't let fear or adversity stand in your way. Love your neighbor. Love your family. Have faith. Forgive.",1520208000,,463,4.395348837209302
