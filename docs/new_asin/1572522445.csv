190217,1,1572522445,"In the 70's films such as this were the stable viewing fodder of the middle class intelligentsia. Searching for something which was not a Mills and Boon romance or an action adventure movie films such as there were seen as sensative and relevant.
In reality this film is not about much at all. An upper middle class male about to marry holidays with a friend. He meets two young women, one ugly (she is not but she has frizzy hair) and another beautiful. He desires to touch the knee of the attracitve one but she finds him rather repellent. He has a sort of teasing relationship with the other one and messes up her life. The end of the film allows our hero to manipulate the grief of Claire so that he can achieve his amibition of touching her knee.
It is hard know to realise the attraction of this film. The dialouge is long winded and tedious. The characters talk endlessly but never about anything.
The attraction of the film is more about the style of the film rather than the content or the form. The house in which the action takes place and the country side are beautifull. The characters have a sort of sophistication around their life, what they drink, what they eat which has been attractive to those outside France. The two female leads are gorgous and the film is well acted.
The only negative is that it is a boring talkative film which is about a self indulgent bore. One sees it and thinks a nuclear war destroying all these characters would not be the end of the world. Still some people probably like it.",1012003200,13,1524,4.446428571428571
190218,5,1572522445,"The title of this charming film by Eric Rohmer is perhaps too provocative.  It really gives the wrong impression, yet Claire's knee is exactly the central point of the film, although in a way that will surprise you.
This is the story about a thirty-something year old diplomat, Jerome Montcharvin, who encounters two pretty girls, sixteen and eighteen years old, while on vacation at Lake Annecy in France (near Lake Geneva, Switzerland) a month before his wedding and finds that they affect him more strongly than he might have expected.  It is especially Claire who brings out a side of his personality that is seldom exposed, much to the merry interest of his friend, Aurora, a writer, who has guided his interest in the girls, ostensibly as material for a story she is writing.  Claire's Knee, it need be said immediately has not so much to do with the pretty girl's knee as it has to do with the protagonist's self-perception.
Jean-Claude Brialy, who plays Jerome Montcharvin, brings a veracious mix of smug confidence and little guy vulnerability to the part spiked with a clear case of self-delusion that illuminates his character very well.  And the girls are indeed very pretty, with Laura, played with coquettish innocence by Batrice Romand, also being clever and slyly sophisticated, vulnerable and honest.  In contrast Claire, played by Laurence de Monaghan, whose fawn-like beauty is perfect for the part, seems superficial and ordinary and a bit distant.  I found myself more attracted to Aurora, played with a gentle and understated irony by Aurora Cornu.  She provides the objectifying point of view for us to realize that while Jerome imagines he is a man in touch with his feelings and has an objective understanding of himself, he is really a man who fools himself about his motivation, a man who can be ugly when frustrated, as he is by Claire's lack of interest in him.
The dialogue, written by director Eric Rohmer, which some have found excessive is anything but.  It is instead clever and witty and at times profound as Rohmer relentlessly explores the nature of love, sex, sensuality and self-delusion.  The cinematography of the lake and the French alps in the summer time is luscious, and the privileged, softly indulgent life style of the characters living around the lake provoked a twinge of jealousy in my soul.  This is a beautiful film, worldly wise, warm, sensual and subtle as a dinner by candlelight.",995760000,8,2436,4.919512195121952
190219,4,1572522445,"First of all, a huge thanks to Winstar for bringing the movies of french director Eric Rohmer in the DVD market. This director is one of the world major directors of the last 40 years, a child of the Nouvelle Vague.  CLAIRE'S KNEE is the fifth of the moral tales serie, shot directly after  the masterpiece MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S.
Like all Eric Rohmer's movies,  CLAIRE'S KNEE is in a certain way hypnotic, in the medical sense of the  word. Because you will pass 100 minutes to listen to actors who are saying  the most deep philosophical truths while playing tennis, eating or climbing  mountains. Most of the actors are non professional but it doesn't matter ;  you will be so interested in the dialogs and in each gesture of the  characters that you won't have the time to remark that Robert De Niro is  not on the screen.
The place : the Lake of Annecy's surroundings, near  Geneva, Switzerland. The argument : a diplomat on holidays, on the verge of  getting married, encounters two young girls, 16 and 18 years old. During  three weeks, he will try to seduce them in order to prove to himself that  he is ready for marriage and cannot fall in love with another woman. It's  very difficult to summarize a screenplay which gives such importance to the  silences of the characters. So, be curious !
Nothing to be mad about the  extra-features and the audio and video transfers.
A DVD for the  fetishists ones.",955929600,9,1409,4.549800796812749

190221,4,1572522445,"The story told in ""Claire's knee"" is pretty strange, and certainly not the kind of plot I generally think is likely to turn into a good movie. In a nutshell, a man in his late thirties (Jean-Claude Brialy) develops an obsession for a beautiful teenager, Claire (Laurence de Monaghan). To be more precise, he is obsessed with Claire's knee, and needs to touch it, exactly as her boyfriend does.

That sounds boring, doesn't it? However, it isn't. This movie isn't about Jerome, the mature bachelor who begins to believe that Claire's knee is everything he wants, or about his friend Aurora (Aurora Cornu), that spurs him to flirt with young girls so she can have inspiration for her writing. It isn't about Laura (Batrice Romand), Claire's sister, eager to flirt with Jerome, and it is certainly not about Claire, that doesn't pay Jerome too much attention. It is a film about wanting what you can't have, and forgetting about it as soon as you get your hands on it. Moreover, it is also story about love and infatuation, and the difference between them.

Will you like this film? I think so, because even though ""Claire's knee"" is not one of Rohmer's best films, it is a movie that you will enjoy watching, not for the story, but rather for the conversations between the characters. This film doesn't have any answers, but it allows you to ask yourself some very interesting questions, and that is the reason why I give it 3.5 stars...

190222,5,1572522445,"An Eric Rohmer film is not a typical film by US standards, or by European stardards either. But it's a very interesting piece of entertainment, at least very beautiful to see.

The story in Claire's Knee is very simple, but even if it was more ambitious or complicated it wouldn't be the point. And this is what people miss when they watch Rohmer's films. It's the pace, the background scenery, the natural ambience. It's an invitation to the viewer to join the cast, and feel like one more character, a very attentive and quiet character. And this is truly the magic of Rohmer's beautiful films, specially this one. Among his films, I prefer My Night At Maud's, because it's not only beautiful to the eye, but the story interests me more too.

Claire's Knee is such a delicate and precious work of art for its simplicity, and it really feels like being sucked into the scene by the characters interactions, and becoming more and more involved in the conversations. You can pick your own sides, and most of all, you can study (try to understand) the characters by staring at their faces without being impolite. And you can also just enjoy the beautiful scenery and breathe fresh air from the Alps.

So I recommend it but warn you that it should be viewed without any expectations as for plot or big excitements. Take it as an invitation to join a few friends for a few days in the French Alps during the summer. Get into the European mood and have a nice vacation.

I wish is had a better quality dvd. The other option is the Criterion edition that just came out.",1155945600,15,1563,4.531914893617022
190223,5,1572522445,"Eric Rohmer seems to be especially fascinated with two ideas: (1) a man over-stepping his intellectualized feelings and then stopping at the crucual moment of decision, and (2) that same man's self-disillusionment. In this movie a French diplomat summering on a beautiful lake in France, one month before he's to be married (to a woman he's ""been able to stay with"" for six years), suddenly has a great desire for a young girl he meets there (Claire). He talks about his will and principles, neither of which he would compromise - he's oh, so intellectual about it - but then there is that nagging desire, which he is able to fulfill by touching her (Claire's) knee.

Rohmer is famous for his characters' endless talking on screen, which leads to some slow moments. But over all, the movie is interesting, and the last 20 minutes excellent. Rohmer understands perfectly the inner workings of this intellectualized buffoon whose feelings are repressed by the machinations of his brain. Definitely worth a watch.",1130284800,4,1010,4.976331360946745
190224,3,1572522445,"Typical Rohmer character study of an engaged man reassuring himself that while he is at the moment ""still free"", he is not in the least bit interested in any other women.  During a vacation, a friend introduces him to a woman with 2 teenage daughters (17-19 years-old).  Our main character spends the first half of the film convincing himself and others that he is quite comfortable with his fiancee and needs no one else, however finds himself drawn to the younger daughter.  The 2nd half of the film finds him suddenly attracted to the other daughter, and developing an obsession with touching her knee, which he sees her boyfriend doing.  By the end of the film, he achieves this goal and that's it, our little Rohmer moral tale is over.

Not very unlike his other films, however the characters and dialogue were not as interesting and compelling to watch as those in films such as My Night at Maud's, A Tale of Springtime, Boyfriends and Girlfriends, Chloe in the Afternoon, and Summer.  All of these films I noted, I wouldn't mind repeated viewings, however once was enough with Claire's Knee.  I feel this is one of his films that does not stand the test of time too well, as much as the others do.  The morals in his other films were more intense and attention grabbing, but this one borders on almost not caring about this guy's situation at all.

As for the DVD quality, yes, we know what to expect from Fox/Lorber, however it is not as bad as other reviewers state.  The opening scenes start out with tons of artifacting, but that quickly gets better moments into the film.  The audio is clear and I found the picture was sharper than Chloe in the Afternoon.  This is still slightly above VHS quality, where Chloe was really not.",1126828800,5,1739,4.592233009708738

down-side.

Eric Rohmer was in the peak of his creative powers with this movie in the early seventies when decided to make that film plenty of sugestive rendition for the femenine charm about a middle aged man who falls in love with a sweet and slender teenager and the main motive of his affection is the knee.

This script will originate a set of funny and smart situations that will rejoin you with the cinema considered as the seventh art.

This treasured film must be included in your personal list of the great French films in any age.

190228,5,1572522445,"This is my favorite film by one of the greatest (and subtlest) writer/directors in world cinema, and its distressingly mediocre rating from so many reviewers here seems solely due to the American cultural hangup with an older man flirting with younger girls.  But the absurdity of such attractions is exactly what this movie is about!  The character of Jerome spends the entire film articulately rationalizing away his very real desire for a young girl who disdains him--finally fixating upon a single touch of her knee as a way to expiate any power she seems to hold over him.  This film is about a man struggling with his own weakness and his own denial.  There is absolutely nothing unseemly in any of Eric Rohmer's handling of this subject, and, indeed, the character of 15-year-old Laura, the girl who is kissed and embraced by the older Jerome, is one of the most knowing and self-possessed characters in the film.  Her ultimate snub of Jerome when, too-little-too-late, he comes to appreciate her, is a key to the subtle humiliation to which Rohmer subjects Jerome.  This film is a masterful examination of how people can speak one way and *act* another because of the power of their desires, and anyone who finds it offensive in some way should just get over it!  Take your cultural baggage somewhere else.",1047427200,30,1314,4.839285714285714
190229,4,1572522445,"I don't know if it's a general feeling or if it's merely the few people whom have reviewed this film here on amazon, but, it seems people don't really like this movie by one of my favorite directors, Eric Rohmer. I think the problem most people have with this movie is not the acting or the directing, or the scenery but it's story-line of an older man being attracted to two much younger girls then himself. And, to be honest, I wasn't really bothered by it that much, but, I was mildly put off.
 I love the characters in any Rohmer film. I enjoy hearing them speak of love, searching for love, and of course when they actually find it. There's such charm and wit to Rohmer's films. He's so subtle in his delivery that I can't help but always fall under his spells. And ""Claire's Knee"" has the elements that make any Rohmer film great, but, it lacked something and for the life of me, I can't put my finger on it other than the seeing this older guy kissing and holding hands with these younger girls. But, there is much to enjoy in this movie anyway.
 Jerome (Jean-Claude Brialy) has returned from Sweden, where he is about to get to get married, to France to sell his old countryside house, where he vactioned as a boy. When he arrives he meets his old friend Aurora (Aurora Cornu). Aurora is staying with a family while in France, getting ready to write a story. She's a novelist. She tells him her story, which is about an older diplomatic man falling for two younger women whom he sees playing tennis everyday. And, in order to give her some inspiration she ask Jerome if he will live out her story. Jerome, at first says no, but, finds that Mrs. Walter's (Michele Montel), the owner of the house where Aurora is staying, daughter, Laura (Beatrice Romand) has a crush on Jerome. And so, without wanting to, finds he's already involved in Aurora's little scheme wheather he wants to be or not. Now, Aurora has a sister named Claire (Laurence de Monaghan), hence the title. And Jerome finds that, even though he won't admit it he is attracted to her too. Especially, her knees. And so it all becomes a tale of a man in one way reliving his past, accepting his future and in another, it's a story of man's everyday struggle with the temptation known as; women. As far as the rest of the plot goes, you have the buy or rent the movie to find out.
 ""Claire's Knee"" is an extremely well done film, that does have it's choice moments. The cinamatography is beautiful. The location shots are breathtaking. The countryside complements the sometimes tender moments of the film. And, Rohmer's directing is first-rate, all the way. Even though I don't feel this film is up to par with other Rohmer films like ""My Night at Maud's"", ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" or ""Pauline at the Beach"", ""Claire's Knee"" is a film I wish more people would see and not be so critical of. A cinematic treat from Eric Rohmer.
 Bottom-line: ""Claire's Knee"" is a film rich in atmosphere. It has some delightful scenes, good dialogue and fine acting. May not be Rohmer's best, but, is still a pleasure to watch.",1026172800,4,3077,4.499105545617174

And as such they are very believable. The dialog isn't just babble, listen more closely. You will feel like you are peeling an apple down to its core. This film is so refreshing to see. Unfortunately, most films today, even the French ones are very superficial and the dialog can at times be even crass.

7797926,5,1572522445,"""Claire's Knee"" (1971 France) is the best of Eric Rohmer's ""Six Moral Tales"" movies.

The best part of the movie is the way it portrays rural France where prosperous Parisians keep vacation homes for holidays by a lovely lake surrounded by mountains.

Probably in the south of France.

Nobody knows how to have good times as well as the French, and we see great French holiday settings in this movie.

The story isn't wonderful, but the trip to France viewers gets makes putting up with the story worthwhile.

What is the story about?

Well....

One horny guy, five unavailable women..wasted in a breathtaking setting in a French mountain lake village where rich people live by the lake, dress well, and ride around in expensive motor boats.

That's the truth about the movie titled Claire's Knee (1970 French Language, English Subtitles), directed by Eric Rohmer, tale #5 of his ""Six Moral Tales.""

Damn!

A neurotic time is had by all....the girls (three ""older"" mid-30's women , including the male star's never present fianc, and two skinny mid-teen girls whose revealing bathing suits reveal mostly protruding bones and knobby knees) never put out, aren't available, really....the two skinny teen girls have boyfriends their own age plus a chaperon mother, one of the two ""older"" women at the lake village has a fianc we see briefly, and the remaining older woman the protagonist early 30's hapless male meets at the vacation resort village is a busy and frazzled single Mom busy tending her teenager kids, working at a job, managing a house for herself, her kids, and the lady writer renter engaged to one guy, but flirting with the hapless main man.

Our hero is about to enter a doubtful marriage with a doubtful and often unavailable women for doubtful reasons...his future wife is never seen...she's a career lady diplomat working in Africa, and he's had bad luck with her in the past...she's not promising and the intended marriage the hero is to start a week after he leaves the French mountain village where the movie is set also isn't promising.

He meets up with four possible sex partner women in the village, and any of them could provide final good times in his bachelorhood before his awful future marriage begins, or even an alternative to it.

But nothing happens, and the whole movie is about that.

In the end, nobody gets laid, and nobody really enjoys the lovely setting where the show takes place....a wonderful French Alps village at the height of summer vacation season...the kind of place people dream of being part of all their lives.

The movie came out in 1970 when mini-skirts and the worldwide Sexual Revolution were big and promising, and flopped not long after.

This movie shows why, at least in part.

What's good about Claire's Knee (1970) is the travelogue side it provides ....the scenery, the color, the lovely water and terrific small boats, the gardens and places people live in, rural France well dressed urban people occupy with style and class as they sit around outdoor tables drinking good wine and engaging in intelligent, animated, interesting conversation, the background actors not part of the story who are having a good time and being sensible, something the main characters can't be accused of doing.

This movie was his advice about where the Sexual Revolution leads, titillating as its short term results sometimes may be (and were...I was there!).

Good advice, often given, seldom taken, especially by the young and those in early middle age.

We're too soon old, and too late smart!

7797927,4,1572522445,"Eric Rohmer explores his favorite two subjects again, i.e human compulsions and ethics. This time his film's backdrop are those lazy hazy days of summer vacation for the upper middle class in the mountains of France.

Several families with chateaus on a lake front visit back and forth during those sun dappled days. Among our group are several teen age daughters and their boyfriends, a few mothers/authors, and a thirty something single guy friend about to finally resign himself to marriage. Beneath the pleasantries exchanged over lunches on the lawn under shade trees, there bubbles vague yearnings and misplaced affections, primarily in the mind of the man. The mother seems almost bemused by his confessions to her.

Rohmer seems to be poking around the idea of how far one can carry his fantasies without crossing over any lines. However he leaves the viewer with an over-all feeling of how fleeting and essentially innocent this all is. Beneath the surface there is really nothing. No shadows emerge.  In the end we are left with a simple portrait of a slice of life, as whispy as a summer cloud scudding over a lake's surface.",1240012800,2,1136,4.90625

In Eric Rohmer's movie we see middle aged diplomat on vacation in France striking a bargain with his writer (girl)friend who is observing a  reaction between two young teenage girls when he tries to seduce them.  Is it possible for the middle aged man, sexually more experienced and worldly to exhibit restraint in seducing two inexperienced, yet attractive young women?  Is it the fact that he is engaged to be married a reason strong enough for him to keep his distance and not make any foolish choices?  Can he influence these two young women into doing something foolish just to satisfy his own male ego in knowing that he was in control of the situation?  I do not know but as a woman, all these guesses were pretty easy for me.  Men in general can bed anything and anyone with little or no regrets.  Actors in the film are mediocre.  Stories are broken by days and feel somewhat fractured, there is no spontaneity to the movie.

I agree with several other reviewers who state that a person either loves Rohmer or finds him boring and pretentious.  I am a big fan of French cinema but I find that I fall into the latter category.  I once lived  with a family in the French Alps, not far from the site of this film and I noticed that the people did not just converse---every sentence had to be some sort of pronouncement.  Fortunately those folks were wise, funny and nice, not like the ones in this movie.  I found the talk of the characters here not only self-important but dull and lacking any of the wit or wisdom that they seemed to believe it contained.  There is a young teenager, who is supposed to be 16 but looks 12 who talks with the self-assuredness of a Sorbonne professor, but again, without the wit.  Some people are charmed by this; I'm not one of them.

I found the whole action of this going-on-middle aged man getting cozy with the teenaged girls rather repulsive.  He is supposed to be just the ""friend"" of the younger one but his actions go way beyond what is appropriate.  True, this adventure is supposed to be for the sake of his novelist friend, who is stuck with the plot of her latest work, but it's still tacky.  As the Amazon reviewer mentioned, the whole point of the film is to show the self-delusion of this guy.  I didn't really get that when I watched it but I certainly agree that he is.

The film is visually pleasing--the mountains, the lake, the beautiful old houses, the pretty young people in their swim suits.  Other than that, I don't find a lot to recommend it.",1191369600,4,1593,4.389078498293515
