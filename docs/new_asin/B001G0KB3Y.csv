The exercises he gives are very useful teaching tools to use in the studio. At this time of my life I teach only adults. Those who have never learned to read music find the concepts of musical notation difficult to comprehend. This video makes it quite clear. That said, I haven't shown it in my classes yet and don't really know whether my students would find it as simple to understand as I did.",1485820800,,529,4.578947368421052
8303309,4,B001G0KB3Y,"I found this video very helpful.  Steven Zee is a teachers teacher.  This video is all about musicality and counting. Of all the instructional tap teachers, he is far the best.  There is not alot of steps and choreography.  If your in the market for steps and tap cheography, check out Steven Zee Rhythm Tap 1 and 2  They are fantastic.",1251417600,5,336,4.442622950819672
