2389317,5,B000AKXHQE,"Jimmy Stewart as Mr kreugar was a staple of my Christmas day as a kid, this and Nora's Christmas gift were on every year and  looked forward too.
I am not a religous person  but to me they were the essence of Christmas, something we now seem to have lost. I couldn't believe it when I found them on Amazon and had to have it immediately,
Great quality and the memories will flood back to you.
Highly reccommended, bring back the old fashiond Christmas we all remember.",1290643200,3,468,4.367816091954023

I Have seen this movie years ago, and they never repeated it. I always wanted it in my collection but couldn't find it untill I was browsing Amazon. I ordered it and it arrived well packed in perfect shape. The detail info was very accurate and it arrived days before I expected it. I won't worry about buying from Amazon in the future.",1264809600,4,677,7.3580246913580245
2389319,5,B000AKXHQE,"So I'll do each movie seperately.  Though put out by the LDS church, these movies are simply Christian and have been enjoyed by other Christian Denominations for years.

Mr. Krueger's Christmas is Jimmy Stewart's last movie.  The only exclusive LDS touch is that it's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  I would give this movie about a 4.5 out of 5 stars because sometimes it lags, and if you're not a Christmas music buff, it can get boring.  But, I always enjoyed it.

Nora's Christmas Gift is a wonderful story about an old woman who comes to the conclusion that the most important part of Christmas is to recieve Christ as her King.  Again, the only exclusive LDS part is the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing traditional Christmas Carols.  I loved this story, and would give it 5 out of 5 stars.  It made me cry, just a warning.

The Story of the Other Wise Man.  3 stars for the animation.  4 for the story.  The story is by Henry Van Dyke and has been a favorite of storytellers since it first came out.  This is a nice rendition, though the animation just isn't that great.

The Nativity.  5 stars.  As I remember, there is nothing really LDS about this, it's just basic right out of the Bible stuff.  Beautiful music, Holy Land backdrop, the actors and actresses speak in native tongues for the area... I saw this at a basic Christmas gathering and no one had anything but great things to say about it, and while there were a few LDS church members, the rest weren't LDS at all.  It was a nice prelude to exchanging gifts to make sure everyone knew what we were celebrating.

In all, this is a nice collection of movies.  I'm glad that it was put out on DVD in a combination like this.",1165449600,20,1686,4.4267100977198695
2389320,5,B000AKXHQE,I'm a big Jimmy Stewart fan and this movie really portrays the Christmas spirit in its truest form. I remember seeing this movie years ago and had to have it for myself. I also enjoyed The Other Wise Man.,1163030400,9,204,4.256410256410256
2389321,5,B000AKXHQE,there was a spirit of peace unlike any other as I watched 'the nativity' featured on dvd. it was indescribable,1141603200,11,110,4.55
2389322,1,B000AKXHQE,"It should be noted that the DVD is put out by the Mormon Church - the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and as such, contains publicity for the Mormon church.",1134864000,8,169,4.151515151515151

2389324,5,B000AKXHQE,So many of these special movies from my cable I would not be able to purchase if were not for Amazon.com.,1424822400,,105,4.0476190476190474
2389325,5,B000AKXHQE,"I have been looking for an older copy of Mr Kruegers Christmas. I also was looking (put out a watch) for Nora's Christmas Gift. There was also 2 other stories on the disc. Even though they are produced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons), it does not shove their religion down your throat. I was the message, not the messenger. Both were nice to watch again, even after Christmas.",1421971200,2,405,4.486486486486487

2389328,5,B000AKXHQE,"Deserves more than five stars.  I bought this from a seller on Amazon as it was only a dollar ninety nine.  It's new in a sealed case.  Wonderful movie, wonderful seller and incredibly fast delivery.",1418688000,,199,4.628571428571429
2389329,5,B000AKXHQE,"No, I'm not a mormon, I'm not even a Christian, but unlike most in American society these days I'm also not on this ""hate all things Jesus"" crusade either. So, on that note, I thought all of these stories were wonderful, I imagine most will point to Jimmy Stewart as Mr Krueger, and he deserves it, but that's not to take away from the others - ""Nora's Gift"" was very uplifting as was the ""Other Wiseman"", ""The Nativity"" was short and definitely not as much to invest in, but still well done.

I say to anyone who will deny themself these films simply because of some silly hatred of religion you are missing out on some great stories for the holidays, these are good wholesome stories with a positive message that I think any family could make part of their Christmas traditions.",1394755200,12,780,4.492957746478873
2389330,5,B000AKXHQE,"Mr. Krueger's Christmas, 25th Anniversary, Starring Jimmy Stewart and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is another product on Amazon that has this same movie on it, and is a collectors item... sometimes for the same price or less.  It also had other free movies on it too.  Check it out.

Both of these DVDs are awesome!",1386892800,2,314,4.672727272727273
2389331,5,B000AKXHQE,"Great older movies, but well worth having them in my collection again.  Had them in the VHS versions, and updated.",1356048000,,114,4.7
2389332,5,B000AKXHQE,"Beautiful addition to your Christmas DVD collection.  Jimmy Stewart plays a lonely old down-on-his-luck janitor who craves the company of others on Christmas Eve.  A little girl caroler touches his heart and his thoughts wander to Temple Square, where, in his mind, he directs the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and then expresses his love for the Savior.  This is a well-acted story and very touching - just the thing to add to the Christmas spirit of your family.  You will also enjoy the other three short videos on this DVD - Norah's Christmas Gift, about a blind woman who is able to see the blessings in her life, The Story of the Other Wise Man, an animated short feature, and the beautifully-filmed story of The Nativity.  A must have for every family.  This DVD was out of print for a while and very hard to find.  Snap it up while it is available!",1355961600,8,850,4.552631578947368
