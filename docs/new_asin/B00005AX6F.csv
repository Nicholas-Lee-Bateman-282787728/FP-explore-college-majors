1419315,5,B00005AX6F,"This is a great DVD and a definite must have for any PJ fan.  It's great to finally see Pearl jam the way they should be seen, live in concert.  Nobody gives a more intense performance and I've been listening to them for 10 years, now finally I have a DVD that I will watch for the next 30 years being able to relive my teenage and early 20s with the music that inspired me then and inspires me now.  I know PJ likes to keep a low profile, they don't do many shows, advertising and videos...so this is definitely a copy to buy. Great performances, great audio...like Eddie says on the inside cover...PLAY IT LOUD!  Wished they had footage on there from Greensboro since I had front row tickets...but I can't complain...",988675200,2,719,4.383458646616542
1419316,3,B00005AX6F,"Before the negativity begins I want to say that I've been a fan since 1992 when they first appeared. I have both bootleg CDs and Videos of Pearl Jam as well as all thier studio stuff. This DVD is cool because it's Pearl Jam, however I am disapointed. Both the video and audio quality is that of a bootleg. The only difference is that there aren't any audience member's heads blocking part of the view, and your more on stage. Yes, bootleg quality was good enough for me before, but when a band itself puts something like this out, you expect much better. I have live tapes of bands from the early 80s that are better quality than this. And this is on a DVD! So this is a warning: It's cool but may not be what you expect. One more thing. Mr. Vedder continues to push his political views onto people via this DVD. Bush is evil and we should all hate the rich (doesn't this make him a hypocrite? He is against hate, yet advocates it). But if you are secure in your views it shouldn't bother you to much, still great music, and actually it's funny.",988675200,4,1045,4.256281407035176
1419317,5,B00005AX6F,"This DVD is a must for Pearl Jam fans.  It completely captures the magic of a live Pearl Jam concert.  From Eddie's anguished lyrics to Mike's guitar smashing, it has everything.  Many of the stops from the US tour are represented on this DVD and they cover most of their albums.  Again, it is definetly worth your money, you'll want to watch it over and over.",988675200,,360,4.409090909090909
1419318,5,B00005AX6F,"You're the type of person that loves reading about good Pearl Jam material, aren't you?  Well then you ought to love this...
This is a beautifully arranged DVD with a terrific array of features.  Pearl Jam gives you montages of themselves, the cities they visited and the fans, all of which are accompanied by some unreleased instrumental tracks from the Binaural sessions.  One of them even sounds like something that could have been on Ten.  They're all lovely clips and I'm sure they will make you nostalgic of the last show you were at, or the last time you were in Cardiff or something.  They have the videos for Oceans and Evolution, which are both very good.  The Oceans video is great, you get a glimpse of them when they were younger and still blowing up.  It's a fun video to have on the DVD seeing as how it was probably made about 9 years before this tour.  The Evolution video is of course really good, and a pleasure to watch.
Matt's Cam is kind of cool, though it's not something I'll probably watch many more times unless I want drumming lessons.  You do get to hear In My Tree which is not on the rest of the DVD.
Ahhh, to the setlist.  Quite honestly, I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was.  I saw them in Albany, and they were very good, but there are always some throwaways.  There really aren't many on this DVD, and they do a great job choosing the keepers.  Each song is at a new venue and it's always a smooth transition into each other.  Songs that sound particulary good are Dissident, Given to Fly, Evolution, Go, Insignificance, Grievance, Evenflow, Daughter, and Animal.  They're really having a good time, and they sound tight and hard.  Of course, not everyone will be satisfied, I would have loved it if Garden, Immortality, Sometimes, Brain of J, and Release were on there, but I'm not complaining.  Being an almost psychotic fan, I was worried Stone was getting bored with Pearl Jam what with Eddie playing guitar more, but he seems really immersed in the music and has some really great solos on MFC and Evolution.  Eddie was in top form talking to the audience and charming everyone as usual.  Okay, I have a crush on him, I'm sorry, it's not even a non-sexual crush, it's just a straight up homosexaul crush, just kidding...kind of.  Look, I have a girlfriend!!
Well anyhow, I'm sure all of you have already purchased this, and want to see the others' reaction.  I'm ecstatic.  Thanks for reading.",988675200,25,2444,4.531963470319635

1419321,5,B00005AX6F,"Phenomenal DVD! It stirred the same emotions one feels when seeing them live in concert. Filmed over the course of the American leg of their 2000 tour, the DVD documents what it's like to experience Pearl Jam live. The band, the arena, the crowd - it's all there as documented by three crew members with hand held equipment.
I wish it included footage from the European leg of the tour, but there's a great European footage montage as a bonus - somewhere I'm in there.
It's a definite buy for Pearl Jam fans, whether they like every album or just a single one - this is a must own.",988416000,,581,4.339449541284404
1419322,5,B00005AX6F,"After suffering through years of bootleg video tapes, at last we have a quality DVD of some of Pearl Jams best songs. First off, play it with Dolby Digital on, it'll blow you away. It instantly puts you in the middle of the arena. Best performances: ""It's OK"" tag to Daughter, ""Given to Fly"" with a girl signing the lyrics that stirs emotions, knowing even the hearing impaired can enjoy Pearl Jam's work. The extra's on the DVD are fairly cool, and the set list is broad, covering all 6 albulms. I'd like to see a follow up, so that they cover all their songs. But that's just a greedy PJ fan talking. So buy it now, and have Pearl Jam perform in your living room every day!",988329600,4,675,4.28125
1419323,5,B00005AX6F,I have over 72 Pearl Jam songs. But no Cd or music video comes close to this 3 hour DVD. With all the preformed songs and the two music videos(Evolution and Oceans)this is a most for Pearl Jam fans. Watch the band tour over 48 cities in the U.S. and Europe. I love this DVD.,988156800,2,274,4.0
1419324,5,B00005AX6F,"This DVD gets more play than any other I own. These songs never get old. That said, my only request is more. This DVD is packed with more songs than any concert, but noticeably missing are Release, Of the Girl, Smalltown, Porch, Crazy Mary, Patriot, Garden, Alive, Black, Soldier of Love, Baba O'Reiley, and Indifference. Sound like a good set list for a second DVD?
This DVD is awesome from beginning to end. Some highlights include RVM and the It's Okay tag from Daughter, which is from Jones Beach and almost as good as the DC version. Rockin in the Free World has some kid who's like Butthead rockin on stage. Personally I would have preferred the Tampa version, but this one rocks too. Also Given to Fly has a signer on stage that everyone seems to like, but again I'd prefer just Pearl Jam. Now almost every time I hear that song I think of that signer, so unfortunately I hardly listen to it anymore. Yellow Ledbetter, played showing only European audiences, is beautiful and makes me wish I were at a concert having as much fun as they were. The Evolution video is like a mini version of The Wall. I never understood why it hardly got any playtime on Mtv, but now I can finally watch it over and over again.
The sound and picture are adequate by DVD standards. It doesn't compare to the quality of Cunning Stunts by Metalica, which has set the standard for DVD concerts, but it is 5.1 digital and except for close-ups of Mike McCready in his wife beater tank tops the camera work is really good. Obviously if you're not a PJ fan this concert isn't for you. But if see them as one of the last cool groups left, pick this up immediately and enjoy an euphoric experience!
Now if they'd only release Unplugged on DVD and I'll be a happy man.",985824000,4,1745,4.405572755417957

I only paid $15 for it and was starting to regret it after the first few songs, luckily it got better about halfway thru.  My favorites had to be Daughter, Bushleaguer, and Don't Believe in Christmas.  Ed and Matt are great as usual, cool to see Boom's first show with the band, Mike and Jeff get more into it as the show goes on, Stone just stands there, not even facing the crowd for the bulk of the it... not sure what is up with that, figure he'd be a little more animated for a homecoming show. 3 stars for the second half of the concert. If you're a big fan that needs to own everything try to snag it cheap, don't pay $40 for it!  If you're a casual fan lookin for an exciting PJ DVD, try Twenty or Live in Cornice much cheaper, much better.",1328313600,2,836,4.079268292682927

Mike, Matt, and Ed still look like they are havin fun but I will admit Jeff seems to just be doin his job and Stone looks downright bored for the most part.  If you go into it expecting one of their signature mid-90's performances you will be dissapointed, but if you watch knowing it is meant to be a ""bootleg"" from a 2000 tour that didn't have a whole lot of significance for the band, it'll be worth the price.  I have to say my favorite parts of the DVD are the extras.  The Evolution video is great and the European Montages are spectacular!",1328313600,,694,4.18796992481203

1419356,4,B00005AX6F,"Pearl Jam's Touring Band 2000 DVD takes footage from numerous shows on their 2000 tour and mixes them all into what feels like one single concert. The performances themselves are great and the audio is powerful and loud; it doesn't take much volume to be blasting the thing. The ""set list"" includes Long Road, Corduroy, Grievance, Animal, Gods' Dice, Evacuation, Given to Fly, Dissident, Nothing as it Seems, Even Flow, Lukin, Not for You, Daughter/It's Ok, Untitled, MFC, Thin Air, Leatherman, Better Man, Nothingman, Insignificance, I Got ID, rearviewmirror, Wishlist, Jeremy, Do the Evolution, Go, Parting Ways, and the encore Rockin' in the Free World. As stated, the musical performances are top notch and the band sounds energetic and great. On the DVD they pretty much just stick to playing the songs, with occasional forays or commentary from Eddie. Two notable moments are 1) in Given to Fly when a woman is on stage doing sign language interpretation before Eddie comes over and begins dancing with her at the end of the song; and 2) during Rockin' in the Free World when Eddie pulls some kid named Jesse from the audience and takes him on stage, initially letting him just stand there and dance before putting him on his shoulders and taking him around the stage, culminating with the kid receiving a drum stick and helping to end the song with cymbal crashes. The one thing that really bothers me about the main concert though is the visual quality, which is awful. It looks like it was transferred from a worn-out VHS, with very grainy visuals, ""halos"" around the band members, and even wavy worn-out-VHS-type lines if you look carefully at stationary items like the amps. It is not distracting enough that it's unwatchable by any means, but it's worth pointing out that it is far from pristine since it's a DVD and obviously the visual appeal is part of the reason for watching it. Otherwise, though, the concert material is fine and they did a great job of putting together great performances from the tour that span the band's career at the time, with the exception of No Code which is hardly represented at all.

The extras are pretty good. They start with European tour montages starting with ""The Cities,"" which shows footage of the band and the crew in the various cities with a cool instrumental playing over it, then moving onto ""The Band,"" which shows footage of the band playing onstage again with a couple cool instrumentals, and then ""The Fans,"" which shows footage of fans at the shows while Yellow Ledbetter plays over the montage. Then there is ""Smile,"" a separate montage that compiles loads of humorous moments from the band during the tour, including many which involve the band in various costumes; it is aptly titled, as it is really funny to watch. Then there is the ""Matt Cam"" feature with a camera centered on Matt for Evacuation, Even Flow, and In My Tree. It is cool to watch him drum and especially in In My Tree you can see what a great drummer he is, but it's probably slightly more interesting for actual drummers. Finally there are two bonus music videos, Do the Evolution and Oceans. Both are great and are worth watching (and both are on YouTube...).

Overall this is really a great DVD that is a must for Pearl Jam fans. The musical performances are great and the band consistently hits the mark throughout the set list with high charisma and strong musicianship. The extras are not essential, but are fun to watch, particularly the two music videos and the Smile montage, which is maybe the highlight of all the bonus features. I removed a star simply because the visuals are so downright bad; if I could remove a half-star that'd be more like it. Definitely worth watching or purchasing for fans.",1290816000,,3745,4.76
1419357,2,B00005AX6F,"I was sorely disappointed with this DVD.  This is in large part because of the sound and picture.  This DVD doesn't just lack, but fails in both categories.  The picture quality is really grainy and the sound is... well, terrible.  It's poorly mixed and has static throughout.

On the plus side if you really like Pearl Jam the track list is really good.

However, even with the awesome track list the DVD is not worth my money despite being a big Pearl Jam fan.",1276646400,,462,4.440476190476191
1419358,5,B00005AX6F,"Ok, this dvd is very straight forward, the performances come from different shows during the U.S. tour for Binaural and is very well edited, so well, that if you didn't notice the guys changing shirts you probably wouldn't know that they come from different shows.
This dvd includes the never released in the U.S. video for ""Oceans"", the song from the band debut album Ten. Also has the ""Do The Evolution"" video. The quality of the recordings is very good but not excellent (at least in the video department) and, if you're not a Pearl Jam fan it may get a little boring after the first hour or so, so if you're not a big Pearl Jam fan I recommend you buy ""Immagine In Cornice"" which is a more fulfilling experience for the casual fan.",1256860800,,735,4.451851851851852

Audio is good with a Dolby Digital track. Their Madison Square concert DVD is still my favorite overall but I am putting this in at a solid 2nd choice.

  Although I also own Live at the Garden and Immagine in Cornice, Touring Band is my favorite concert dvd from Pearl Jam. The 2000 tour seems to me to be when they decided that they were going to keep at it (after a few difficult years) and ultimately become legends.

1419374,4,B00005AX6F,"Touring Band 2000 (2001.), Pearl Jam's second offical DVD release

When it comes to having a reputation as a great live band, Pearl Jam's is second to none. From their earlier days when the band was part of the alternative grunge rock explosion though to the latter days where the band took a more devoloping and experimental direction, the band has had many successful and memorable tours. In 2000, following the release of the band's sixth studio album, 'Binaural', the band embarked on an extensive European and USA tour which would last them the best part of 5 months. At the time, the band conceived the idea of recording all of their concerts and releasing a concert official bootleg series. This became reality when the 72 concert series was released after the tour. However, coupled along side this, 3 memebers of the Pearl Jam tour crew had shot extensive video footage, including all of the bands concerts in the USA. As a further memorable reminder for the 2000 tour, the band released a 28 song DVD set showing the best moments of their tour. The question is does this DVD do the band's great 2000 tour the justice it desrves?

Pearl Jam are one of my all-time favourite bands and during the course of me reviewing their catalogue on amazon, I've given plenty of their albums, both live and studio, a five star rating. However, I've always felt the DVD's have been the weaker side of the Pearl Jam release cannon. That's not to say they're bad, it's just that in some cases they don't do the band the full justice they deserve; the prime example being the 2003 'Live At The Garden' release which features one of Pearl Jam's weaker full live performances. That said though, Pearl Jam's 2000 tour release is perhaps their stronger DVD so far. The picking of 28 high moments at concerts on the US leg of the tour and putting them into one DVD was great idea. It's a highlights package in many respects but it's a damn good one and shows many fine performances from the band during their tour. So, even though it's not one great, single concert; it might as well be because the DVD features 2+ hours of Pearl Jam playing plenty of their best material. It's an amazing document of great sounding, high energy rock n' roll with all 5 band members on top form. Furthermore, the DVD features some great extras. The 2 songs videos for 'Do The Evolution' and 'Oceans' are good extras on the DVD and the snapshot footage sequences for the European leg of the tour are great also.

Best moments of the DVD? It's hard to pick, seen as the songs are best moments on the tour anyway! The 'Leatherman', 'Betterman' and 'Nothingman' set from the final concert in Seattle is exceptional. Eddie Vedder's expressive vocals resonate throughout the stadium and the band give a stellar performance. The 'Rocking In The Free World' is also an excellent encore song to finish the DVD - Eddie Vedder invites a kid onto the stage to sing along and dance to the song and the band give another inspired performance. 'Grievance' and 'Corduroy', two classic Pearl Jam songs are fantastic editions and sound really great as does, remarkably, two of the weaker songs off 'Binaural' in the shape of 'God's Dice' and 'Evacuation'. The band play the fan favourite 'Lukin' and subsequent run-in track, the slow, sludgy 'Not For You' in great style also. The final highlight is of course the 'Rearviewmirror'. The band always get psyched up for this song and this version is no exception - magnificent!

Pearl Jam's 'Touring Band 2000' release is by far they're strongest DVD release so far in their career. The highlights package style format captures the band in amazing and memorable form and features some of their best music. Any fan of the band should consider getting hold of a copy of the DVD as it further demonstates just how awesome a band Pearl Jam are and how effective they are live.

I was in the audience during this awesome performance of Corduroy in DC.  The energy was intense at the very least.  Don't pay attention to those who say this DVD was crap because they obviously do not know what they are talking about.  These are probably the kind of people who need big props and fancy lasers on stage to keep their interest.  It's also evident that they have never been to a PJ concert.  True music lovers will enjoy it.  The music and footage is intentionally raw and hard.  PJ doens't need all the flash to sell their shows, it's all about the music and the atmosphere.

1419379,5,B00005AX6F,"Being a die-hard fan ever since I first heard ""TEN"", I went nuts when I first saw this on the shelf at my local video store. I just knew I HAD to have it, and it is truly a MUST HAVE for any PJ fan. It was taken from several different cities in North America during their 2000 tour in support of their 6th studio album, ""Binaural"". And if you love that album as much as I do, you'll love this DVD. But even if you don't, it still has alot of classics from all of their other earth shattering albums to enjoy, like ""Corduroy"", ""Given To Fly"", ""Daughter"", ""Nothingman"", ""Rearviewmirror"", and what concert would be complete without ""Jeremy""? The DVD starts off with ""Long Road"", a really cool song. I don't know if it's a cover or an original PJ number, but it really sets the mood. Another favorite of mine is ""I Got SH*T"", a very powerful song despite a cheesy title. Following ""Daughter"", Eddie gives the crowd a small part in a short little cover of Dead Moon's ""It's OK"". Also for ""Given To Fly"", there is a woman named ""Kim"" doing sign language for the song, which is real interesting to watch. The DVD ends with their classic cover of Neil Young's ""Rocking In The Free World"", in which Eddie (who looks kind of like Jim Morrison with his beard) brings a little kid up on stage to party it up, showing his well-known sensitivity towards the younger generation. IF you really love the band, you will absolutely LOVE this DVD! It really shows how they have all evolved over the years into a classic rock group that's here to stay. Every time I watch it I'm proud to be a life-long fan. I used to have just the VHS, but then the other day I got the DVD and I love the extras. You have ""Matt-Cam"" (a camera shot of just Matt Cameron the amazing drummer for 3 or 4 of the songs), clips from their European tour, crazed crowd clips, and last but not least, the popular animated video ""Do The Evolution"" and the never before released in the U.S. video ""Oceans"". All in all a fantastic DVD, that shows off the bands talents. Picture and sound quality are great for being a documentary type recording. Some may argue that ""Live At The Garden"" is better. In some ways it is, and in some ways it's not. They are BOTH essential DVD's to own if you like (or love) the band. And what's really cool about the two is that only a few of the same songs are on both, so you get a huge number of individual songs you haven't seen before. Also, don't listen to people who say ""this isn't PJ"" or, ""They've lost it"". These people are wrapped up in how THEY think a band should look and sound after 9 years of performing. Get over it- people have the right to mature and change, and PJ is no different. And in my opinion, they've changed for the better.

Talk about boring, they don't move around much at all these days, and Eddie Vedder is just a shoe starer these days, not much character to his microphone perfromance.

The music sounds pretty bad as well, at least compared with their records.

1419381,5,B00005AX6F,"After collecting the entire CD collection of Pearl Jam, I decided that the entire compilation would not be complete without a DVD of the band. So in essence this DVD 'Touring Band 2000 is exceptional.

The footage is 100% supurb with the sound quality and the media quality above par. This DVD is a roundup of Pearl Jam's 2000 North American tour and they have 24 songs that was collated from the different concerts including their home city of Seattle.

Every Pearl Jam fan will be happy with the song collections on this DVD which includes my favourites 'Evacuation', 'God's Dice', 'Even Flow' and 'Evolution'. There are extra special features included in this DVD, video clips of 'Wishlist' and 'Do The Evolution'. There are the Fan Footage, City and Band documentaries.

There's no gimmicks or extra band members, just five great musicians putting on a great show. The extras are nice also and at around three hours, it's a great value purchase. It ranks up there with Springsteen in New York, U2 Go Home and the Led Zeppelin double DVD. I bought Live At The Garden after getting Touring Band, but was a bit dissappointed.

1419393,2,B00005AX6F,"I bought this DVD a while ago, I no longer have it in my possesion and for good reason.

To start with I really like Pearl Jam, their is no reason why you shouldn't unless you don't actually like ""real"" music.

Pearl Jam used to be a really good band.

Their albums Ten, Vs, Vitolagy, No Code, and Yield are all very good albums each one with a different sound - and a progressed sound as well.

And their Live on Two Legs album isn't half bad either.

But I think since Binuaral, Pearl Jam have become lazy and slack, not only in their live performances but also in their music as well and the quality of there albums.

Binuaral would of been a fantastic album (the album supporting this tour on this DVD) if the songs had been performed better and Eddie Vedder actually bothered to make a decent effort singing. The whole record sounded muffled and with no real sound that grabbed you like their other albums.

The album that followed in 2002 that is Riot Act was just as bad in performance if not worse and in fact its with out a doubt their worst album to date. The tour that supported that record ""Live at the Garden DVD"" was just embaressing and pathetic, and above all else they decided to throw in a giant spinning strobe ball to add to the horrendous occasion.

Now onto the DVD.

To start off with this is not the real Pearl Jam.

Mike McCready (lead guitarist) has gotten very fat

and Eddie Vedder looks exhausted and tired with a beard, and his singing is just mumbling and shouting with no real emotion.

Overall the clips from the 2000 tour are boring and the sort of thing you would want to watch to put you to sleep.

The real Pearl Jam, used to be angry and their live performances were intense and they used to sound alot tighter and into it, like they actually cared about what it was they were doing. If you want to see or hear proof in this check out  the ""Alive EP"" or ""Even Flow Video Clip""

Now sure you can't stay 21 forever and leap around the stage like an idiot, but surely you can mature as a band without being boring or lazy or getting fat!!!

Pearl Jam used to be good, but they just don't know when to call it a day and sadly they haven't, they have sold out and have lost themselves fans and people that care about what music they are putting out right now.",1102550400,5,2292,4.23448275862069

Daughter, from one of the Jones Beach dates, kicks ass when Eddie leads the crowd in ""It's Ok"" from Dead Moon.  Also the San Diego show will always be one of the biggest highlights of my life.

En realidad no es un concierto en vivo entero, si no que se trata de canciones extraidas de distintos recitales a lo largo de la gira. Pero esto no le quita valor a este documente. Momentos memorables como en ""Rocking in the free world"" donde Eddie sube al escenario a un nio con discapacidades o cuando en ""Given to fly"" presentan a una persona que interpreta el tema con lenguajes de seas para sordo-mudos.
Es imperdible ademas el bonus track con imagenes de la parte europea de la gira. Y en especial los bloopers y cosas graciosas sonando de fondo el tema ""Smile"". Muy buena la parte en que los integrantes de la banda aparecen disfrazados de los Village People.

I thought this DVD would be alot better than it was, but when I think about it this DVD is quite awful.
The setlist is the only thing good about it, if only it had been performed better, things might have been alright!
Eddie Vedder(The Singer) sounds terrible and the music is performed badly too.
 One reviewer suggested them rehearsing and I can only agree!
Alot of Pearl Jam songs of Yield and No Code are expermimental and kind of ruin what should be a solid setlist, thats not to say that No Code and Yield are bad albums, no way.
And Binurals songs are good but sound kind of misrable and boring too, which is a real shame.

If you've seen the video clip to Even Flow, you'll see Eddie Vedder jumping around like a maniac going nuts full of energy, which represents the music, the same goes for the rest of the band.
But I think ever since Vitolagy, Pearl Jam have decided they don't wanna rock hard anymore, they would rather stand round on stage playing their instruments and be boring and uninteresting.
I bought this DVD and thought it would be good, but it aint.
The Music isn't performed well and Eddie Vedders singing is just blurted out tuneless mumbling and blabber.
And Eddie Vedder should shave his beard off and leave it shaved off, beacuse on this DVD he looks like he's 100 years old.

Armed with a three-man/woman film crew, this concert video is chock full of songs (29 to be exact) and is well worth the trip to ... buy.

1419402,5,B00005AX6F,"Pearl Jam has been one of my favorite bands ever since I was wearing flannel and being an angst filled.  This DVD has it all, old, new, and everything in between.  With a 28 song setlist, this disk has quite a bit to offer.  The picture quality is not the best, but it has that ""old movie"" kind of feel.  I do believe that this was done quite intentionally.  The sound, on the other hand, is absolutely amazing.  I picked this up right when it first came out. I took it home and proceeded to pump it through my Digital 5.1 home theater system and it just rocked.
A nice thing about the DVD is that the setlist includes some of the non-album B-sides from the old record singles. ""Leatherman,"" ""I got id,"" and ""Long Road"" are all rarities included.  The only disappointments were the absence of ""Alive,"" ""Black,"" and a couple of other tracks that were not released as singles.  But hey, with 28 songs on the DVD, who am I to complain?  Additional highlights include ""Given to Fly"" where there is a person signing the whole song.  Why anyone would sign a concert is beyond me, but, it is beautiful to watch.  Ed brings her up on the main stage and dances with her. . . It is great.
The extras on the disk are good. It has the video for ""Do the Evolution,"" and the video for ""Oceans."" The second of which, I don't think ever hit MTV. There is the ""Matt Cam"" that is mounted to the drum kit and shows the drummer through three whole songs.  There are little films that show where the tour went, show the band, and show the fans.  The ""places"" and the ""band"" mini-films have instrumental tracks going on in the background that are pretty cool.  The ""fans"" mini-film has a really great live version of ""Yellow Ledbetter"" playing.
Above all else, the DVD is a culmination of 6 studio records and almost ten years of being one of the most influential bands of their time.  If not for bands like Pearl Jam, there would be no Nickleback, there would no Creed(even thought I am convinced that the world could do without Creed). This band rocked in 1991 and still rocks in 2002.  I hope they go on for a very, very, long time to come.

Now with such a diverse collection of favorite moments from a long tour and the obserdity of releasing a DVD from each show, like the Bootleg Cd series, what can a poor band do?
Well, get three camera handy road crew members to tape the shows and paste together songs from a wealth of locations across the NA tour and see what they come up with.
And that is a superb collection of songs, all played with Pearl Jams trademark quality and a blured, dirty but effective feel to the package that you feel like you are still there in the audience and realy need to  ""Play It Loud"".
And as a tribute to the consistantcy of Pearl Jam as a touring band this collection of songs from numerous locations comes of as though it was one hell of a show.

While all the songs on the DVD were filmed in different cities, the set list here pretty much approximates a true Pearl Jam concert from the 2000 tour, from the effective opener ""Long Road"" all the way to Neil Young's ""Rockin' in the Free World"" which was a surprise closer in many shows. Each track here was apparently selected as the most visually interesting tape of that song available, or at least one of the strongest musical performances. So you don't get the errors and miscues that you get on many of the unedited bootlegs. Therefore it's not totally realistic, but the visuals are a real bonus, especially for this band that doesn't do videos and is hardly ever photographed. Some highlights include a woman doing sign language for the crowd in ""Given to Fly"" (St. Louis) and Eddie Vedder bringing a kid on stage in ""Rockin' in the Free World"" (Albuquerque). Included in the catch-all montage that accompanies ""Smile"" are some moments that are clearly audible in the bootlegs, like the woman with the white umbrella in Pittsburgh, and the plethora of costumed freaks (including the band) for Halloween in San Francisco. Among the best of the DVD ""bonuses"" is the MattCam, which films Matt Cameron throughout three of his most powerful songs, Todd McFarlane's video for ""Do the Evolution"" (highly influenced by ""The Wall""), and the scenic montage from Europe.",1007510400,2,1513,4.9140625

And if your a hardcore fan lik myself, you'll want them all but alas the average Pearl Jam fan cannot afford to buy every available bootleg, and Pearl Jams answer to this... a form of best of bootleg Dvd.
Touring Band 2000, from a technical standpoint can be regarded as a 50/50 affair, on one hand you have perfectly produced dolby 5.1 surround sound, but on the other hand you have a grainy hand held camera recorded picture throughout.
However it must be said that the picture quality does by no means hinder the enjoyment you will get out of this Dvd, 30 seconds into the concert when the lights come on and Eddie, Matt, Stone, Mike and Jeff are standing there on stage, you'll soon forget all else.
As with any live album (especially in this format) the choice of tracks is bound to be questioned, If your not a fan of Pearl Jam and this is your first time I would advise that you look elsewhere in order to get used to the band.
As is always the way with Pearl Jam they do what they want and not what people think they should do, and the track selection is true to this philosophy.
With there close relationship to Neil Young shining through with a cover of 'Rockin' In The Free World' and 'Long Road'.
Other more familiar Pearl Jam tracks include 'Jeremy', 'Evenflow', 'Evacuation', ' Given To Fly' and about 23 others.
The disc also includes two bonus videos, the fantastic animatic 'Do The Evolution', and 'Oceans'.
Along with some additional previously unheard material which acts as backings to fan/band/location features.
As an unmentioned bonus the songs 'Yellow Ledbetter' and 'Smile' are also featured on the Dvd at different points.
The only reason I haven't given this Dvd the additional star is because of the picture quality, although from a fans point of view I would give it the 5.

Everything is there; the emotion, the sheer euphoria, Eddie's superb moodiness and beauty and the fury of the tunes.
The sign language of the amazing 'Given to Fly'. The absolutely stunning version of 'Betterman'. The version of Neil Young's 'Rockin in the Free World' and the child he lifts to his shoulders. Additionally, the inclusion of some Pearl Jam outtakes and tidbits is amazing, as is the sheer power and precision of the 'Do the Evolution' music clip on DVD.
It is undoubtedly a near perfect Pearl Jam set, and the best thing is, you can take yourself to any of your favourite song while wileing away the hours and pretending you are you were there.
Certainly, it has its pitfalls, like the exclusion of the absolutely quintessential 'Black' and 'Alive', and the strange inclusion of tunes like 'Leatherman' over such songs.

I saw Pearl Jam live in Oslo 29 june, the day before the Roskinlde tragedy and I was more than impressed. It was the first time I saw Pearl Jam live. I really enjoyed watching the European footage on the DVD, especially the fans, they were insane! The setlist could have been better. Where are black, small town, present tense, light years, immortality, release, off he goes and Alive. Taking this under consideration, this is not some kind of greatest hits. Still, the songs you will hear on this DVD are awsome! The highlight is Given to fly. Listen to Eddie's powerfull voice! Daughter is very interesting. There must be many good versions of that song! Long road is a good opener. I listen to it more and more, Insignificance is the best rocky song. Even flow could be taken from another place. My personal favourite is the other philadelpia show, they play it much better and Mike's Solo is insane! The same with Jeremy and Animal! The only wekness here is Evacuation. Doesn't get to me! they should have put in state of love and trust from Detroit instead!  A conclusion is that the DVD is greater than any other music dvd out there, you get 28 songs, 2 musicvideos, matt-cam where you can follow the drummer Matt Cameron,  Smile which is some funny stuff and European montage with fans, the band and the different cities! I highly recommend it. It proves Pearl jam to be the one of the greatest live acts ever to hit the stage! It is not just something everybody says. It is true! Find out!
On the Las Vegas show and Seattle 2 they say that this might be it! That this was the last time ever.... we get to see the greatest band in the world.! Hope not! But then, releasing 72 bootlegs is a pretty good way to end it all. It is a great gift for all fans in the world. Hope to see and hear PJ again! Pearl Jam wil never die, Long live Pearl Jam!!",1001548800,6,2080,4.3307692307692305
1419419,5,B00005AX6F,"When I watched this DVD I was really impressed. The sound quality was great and the songs were performed very well.
I especially loved the songs Insignificance, RVM and Evolution in this DVD. The ""Matt-Cam"" is also great. The ""Smile"" part was very nice. (By the way, how many shots did Eddie take to put the shot from  half-court?). I've never seen the video for Oceans before and it's nice.
The only complaint i have about this cd is that they didn't include Black (In my opinion, best PJ song ever, and the best song of the 90') and Light Years.
Buy this DVD if your'e a PJ fan and you won't regret it.",1000944000,2,604,4.298245614035087
1419420,4,B00005AX6F,"I'm not the biggest PJ fan in the world, but I definitley dig their music.  They are without a doubt one of the best bands around today.  I got this DVD after watching my friends copy.  It is just packed full of music, just one song after another. I personaly find no problem with the lack of any behind the scenes stuff, I'm happy with the music, but that might be a drawback for some (probably not that many though).  The quality is outstanding, both sound and picture.  The performances are solid and the setlist is lengthy and diverse.  It has a few extra tidbits that make it even more worth it.",1000684800,3,600,4.3125
1419421,5,B00005AX6F,"This DVD is a collection of various takes from Pearl Jams last tour (that in support of Binaural). In many ways, it resembles the series of live cd's that the band released earlier in the year. The DVD gives the viewer the impression of watching a complete show (and an rather long show at that). The band roars through an impressive list of songs, and sounds spectacular in nearly all of them. This DVD captures one of the best elements of Pearl Jam: the raw power of their performance.
In addition to the two-hours of very moving live music, the DVD also offers the studio videos to ""Do the Evolution,"" and ""Ocean."" The ""Oceans"" video is an especially welcome addition to the video, because it's so rarely shown (if ever shown on t.v. at all) The DVD also gives video montages of the band (on and off stage), as well as the band's fans.
The only down side to the video is that it doesn't really give any interviews of the band. So, basically, it's just music. But, judging by the rating I gave the video, music really is enough when it's this good.  I would recomend this video to anyone who likes Pearl Jam (especially the live CD's).  It's definitely a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.",1000166400,2,1200,4.5
1419422,5,B00005AX6F,"It is amazing that after releasing all 72 bootlegs from their Binaural Tour, Pearl Jam also decided to release this DVD, whis is absolutely imperative to have for all the jamheads out there. And it is a great DVD, with the performances and the European footage and the instrumental songs. My main complaint about it is the setlist. Where is Black?? It is just a staple song played at most of PJ concerts, but they didn't include a version here. I think the Vegas version is just beautiful. And I think they should also have included Baba, and Yellow Ledbetter, which were regular appearances towards the end of the North American shows. And what about Elderly Woman..., it is also a great live PJ song that should've been included. Anyway, I guess whatever the setlist was, PJ would never be able to please all their fans. It would take to release all 72 videos as well to do so. But this is still a great video and a great gift to their fans from one of the best rock n roll bands ever.",999648000,,987,4.398907103825136

1419424,5,B00005AX6F,"Having seen Pearl Jam three times on their tour supporting Binaural I was eagerly awaiting the DVD and Pearl Jam doesn't disappoint on this one.  The filming is a far away from rock star indulgence as you get - many cameras all over the place - far away getting the entire stage and close up on individual band members really giving the viewer an idea of what it's like to see Pearl Jam from just about any seat in the venue.  The editing and sound are also top notch.
I wished there would have been more of the spontenaity of a Pearl Jam show (although the transition from Lukin to Not for You is outstanding)- more banter between the band and the crowd -and some of the rare live songs and covers that the band had made a habit of performing at several different stops in the tour.
Overall, with Single Video Theory, this is the definitive Pearl Jam live document.  No pretention, just straight ahead rock from start to finish.",997315200,3,929,4.421052631578948

I would have liked to see ""Alive"" and ""Yellow ledbetter"" on the DVD ( there's only a Ledbetter soundtrack in the European footage section ) , but nevertheless the DVD is quite impressive , both from the quality of the performances as well as from the technical standpoint .

1419427,4,B00005AX6F,"The true gems of this 28 song set taken from their North American 2000 tours is the unique moments it captures from different cities across the continent.  The sign-language woman, Kim, in St. Louis dancing and signing ""Given to Fly"" is truly sublime.  Art in a different form allowing everyone to see Eddie Vedder's expressive words in an entirely new way.  Also, the kid rocker in Albuquerque riding around on Vedder's shoulders, finished off Rockin In The Free World with drumstick in hand, crashing cymbals.  It's truly great and reminds us why we are loving this band so much.  They are doing it for the fans and the love of rock music.  Purist in an unpure industry.  I find it surprising, with the emotional intensity of PJ's music that the band doesn't go more crazy on-stage, but they've been there and done that in the early days and their focus is more on making the music here. The extras thrown in for the DVD version are worth it, giving us the Do The Evolution animated video, the ""Matt""-cam, a Smile montage, and an appreciation of the good things about the European tour.  Great music from a stripped down band with garage-like production with hand-held cameras.  It's the compliment to all the live bootlegs they put out, a forte effort in and of itself. It's good to see them put some b-sides on here as well, Long Road, Leatherman, and I Got Id.  The Daughter tag is great.  If you are a PJ fan, don't miss picking up this DVD.",995241600,6,1447,4.5482625482625485

The concert footage was filmed by the stage crew from PJ's world tour and you get to see their best performance from each song.  The sound on this DVD is good, I cannot give it a full 5 stars but I think that is due to MY sound system NOT the DVD.  The film footage is also good, not great (hey the camera man was an extra stage guy, what do you expect!)  I would have also liked to see some of the cover songs that PJ performs.

1419429,5,B00005AX6F,"There is something truly amazing about this DVD. Watching it reminds me of why I feel in love with Pearl Jam's music way back in 1991. This band has only gotten better with time. To the reviewers who say that Vedder's vocals have weakened, I have no idea what you were listening to. To the reviewers who complained about the picture quality, that was the effect that they were going for! This is the band who has embraced vinyl! In the DVD liner notes, Vedder even comments that it was very ""Econo"". Highlights include Eddie dancing with the woman signing during ""Given To Fly"". Just the smile on his face is priceless. The energy that Jeff Ament and Mike Mccready give during ""Evenflow"" is really great as well. Although I wish they would have used the Virginia Beach version, the Jones Beach version of ""Daughter/It's Ok"" is still good. The Seattle chant for Jeff, the fact that they put Leatherman->Betterman->Nothingman in order on the setlist, the fact that they played I Got ...(Id), the full version of Wishlist, and Parting Ways and RITFW are all excellent things that this DVD contains. The ""Smile"" video with the ""Wash Lady"", the band goofing off, and Ed and Jeff playing basketball are all awesome. This DVD really shows you a lot about Pearl Jam, hell the whole DVD is incredible. I get chills everytime I see it. I've seen Pearl Jam live twice and I pray that they tour again.",993859200,2,1389,4.627530364372469
1419430,5,B00005AX6F,"I just bought this DVD yesterday, after wanting it ever since I heard about it. I expected a lot from this DVD, after all, it IS Pearl Jam, and I got it! The sound is AMAZING, just like on the bootleg CDs. The picture is also very good. To those who are complaining that it looks crappy: If you want a perfectly edited video with all the ""right shots"", go get a Britney Spears tape. I think that the imperfect-ness of the picture makes the DVD seem more ""real"", if that makes any sense -- PJ aren't really a band to gloss anything over, in my opinion.
The extra features are great; I love the ""out-takes"" of the band ...a lot of people seem to think that these guys are constantly depressed, but it seems to me like they enjoy themselves pretty well! The moments with Kim, the sign-language woman, and Jesse, the little kid, up on stage, were very touching, and just prove that PJ aren't a group of people that hold themselves higher than others merely because they're famous.
I have no complaints on the DVD, however, I would have liked to see a few of my other favorite songs on the DVD, as I'm sure others would have, too, but that didn't ruin anything for me.
If this is how good the band sounds and looks live on a DVD, then I can't wait to see them live, because this just completely blew me away!",993600000,2,1303,4.258064516129032
1419431,5,B00005AX6F,"Having seen Pearl Jam live twice, and one of those times having been the summer of 2000, I was awaiting ""Touring Band 2000"" with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, Pearl Jam play longer than any other band around, with sets routinely running 2.5 hours, and even then you want more.  So it is only natural that a fan would want to recapture some of this experience at home.  At the same time, though, there is so much energy at a PJ concert, I was worried that the DVD would seem flat.
I need not have worried, because the DVD is superb.  There is a great mix of old and new, fast and slow songs.  The transitions from one venue to the other are seemless, and the sound is outstanding (note, I'd recommend not using 5.1 channel surround, it sounds a little too processed that way).  There is also the unique ""Matt Cam"" angle, which gives you the view from Matt Cameron's drum riser with a heavier percussive mix.
Where the DVD really shines though, is in the cinematography.  It consists exclusively of hand held footage shot by the roadies.  As a result the DVD presents a rough, in your face viewing that matches perfectly with the band itself.  The mixture of wide shots covering the whole stage, close-ups on individual band members and pans of the crowd almost mimic the view of someone sitting in the front rows.  I promise, if you crank this DVD loud enough, you'll feel like you're at a show.
As for the remaining features, the European montages are interesting, and the instrumentals they are set to are pretty cool; it's always nice to hear something new from PJ.  Of course, it's nice to have a clean copy of the ""Oceans"" and ""Do the Evolution"" videos with decent sound.  My personal favorite, however, were the outtakes from the North American Tour set to ""Smile"".  Aside from the fact the song is one of my favorites, and aside from the fact the Pearl Jam dressed up as The Village People is worth the price of the disc, it really captures the essence of the band.  They're genuinely having fun; they aren't in it for the money, they're in it because they love the music and they love their fans.  In this day and age that's pretty special...and so's this DVD.",993513600,32,2171,4.474619289340102
1419432,5,B00005AX6F,"If you haven't yet purchased or at least seen this video, please stop denying yourself an absolutely incredible home concert experience and go take a look.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  If you've ever seen live Pearl Jam, be it in person or on a video, then you know what you're getting as far as the band's stage presence goes.  You're not going to get lasers, you're not going to get mind bending special effects.  You will, however see rock n' roll in it's purest modern day form.  Great (not excessive) camera angles, excellent 5.1 audio format, a nearly flawless track list and great special features ensure you will not become bored with this anytime soon.  For those of you not familiar with the ""Do the Evolution"" video, you don't know what you're missing.  The animation is incredible and really follows the story of song to a ""T"".  The body of the live compilation includes about 30 songs.  Unfortunately, Alive and Black are not included.  Don't let the absense of some of the more popular songs deter you from buying this.  You would only be cheating yourself and you'll probably rediscover great songs like Leatherman and I Got ID that you may have overlooked in the past.  I have owned this for a couple months now and I still play at least ten minutes of it every day.

1419434,5,B00005AX6F,"I really missed out when I didn't see PJ on their last tour. I was a huge fan when I was younger, from the time Ten came out until Vitalogy, but I was too young then to be going to concerts, and then I got back into them when Binaural came out, but I couldn't make it to any concerts. Fortunately, I was able to hear plenty of them, and this DVD nearly makes up for any concerts I may have missed.
As good as their music is, WATCHING Pearl Jam makes it even better, I get goosebumps at so many parts in the ""show."" The audio quality is just fine, but the video isn't awesome. It is still better than no video at all, but even Led Zeppelin's 25 year old, Song Remains the Same looks better on my old VHS taped off VH1 than this.
The Setlist is good, its so hard to pick a ""definitive"" Pearl Jam setlist, because as we know, they are incredibly varied. But aside from the clothing changes, this seems very much like one continuous show - with the exception of seeing the band's breath in the Wisconsin show (Stone looks really funny all bundled up during Dissident). They included songs like Corduroy, Nothing as it Seems, Evenflow, Not For You, Daughter, Betterman, Rearviewmirror, and Do the Evolution, which were played in most of their 2000 shows.
The best songs were the ""unique"" ones, where they added something new, like Kim(?) during Given to Fly, and the kid in RITFW, and the It's Okay during Daughter (which is way cooler than the ""mumbling"" call & response Eddie and the audience normally do). I absolutely love those moments. Also good is Do the Evolution, with Eddie's ape movements, West Memphis Three mention, and an absolutely CRAZED look during the last verse when he says ""I am the first man to.......EVERYTHING!"". Rearviewmirror is also really good, even with the weird montage in the middle, I LOVE the ending with all the lights going off.
The bonus features aren't amazing, but worth watching anyways. The Do the Evolution video is great to be able to see in such good quality.
Although most of these reviews seem varied, I would still recommend this DVD to anyone, my roomates enjoyed it, and they aren't big PJ fans, so at least rent it.",992995200,2,2160,4.4847715736040605

But while there are warm, emotional segments on the disk and the sound is lush, the picture quality is pretty lousy. This is a DVD, folks. Not an 8 mm movie. The close-ups on Eddie and the other band members should be much sharper and the lighting should be vivid and colorful. But images are soft and,for the most part, dull. The roadies who shot the footage had their hearts in the right place, but their technical skills are lacking. Still, once you get past the lousy picture quality, you can appreciate this DVD for its terrific sound and its ambition to capture special, moving moments of the 2000 American tour.
Also, this DVD makes it clear that Pearl Jam has become the Eddie Vedder show. He's like Neil Young to the Crazy Horse of Mike, Stone and Jeff. The only other person on stage who demands attention is Matt Cameron. While Mike McCready's guitar licks sound great, the video often shows him looking off to the side of the stage appearing bored and disinterested. Jeff and Stone occasionally jam together but this band is hardly as exciting to watch as U2 or the Who. I love their music and Eddie Vedder is a charismatic front man, but they don't have the same energy on stage they had 10 years ago.",991958400,7,1451,4.458646616541353

Not my words, but an instruction written by Eddie Vedder on the inside cover of the DVD case. But what sound advice it is. Never before have I seen a music video that pleases on so many levels. To be honest it isn't quite perfect. But that's only because some of my personal 'Jam' favourites are missing from the set-list. Aside from that, the tracks that are included are classics, and performed with such vigour and vitality, that you really wish you'd been there at every single concert. From rousing renditions of Corduroy and Grievance, right through Given To Fly and Even Flow, and ending with Neil Young's powerful and energetic Rocking in the Free World, it's difficult to stop the disc and take a break.
The extras provided are good. We get the videos of Oceans and the remarkably interpreted Evolution, as well as montage videos of the band on tour and generally larking about. It's great to see a band behaving so naturally on stage and clearly enjoying themselves so much. They don't seem to take themselves so seriously nowadays, and it shows through their music.
I absolutely adore this music, and always will, that's why the disc has a treasured place in my collection. Whether you worship Pearl Jam, like them or have never heard them before, buy this DVD and get enlightened.

Not to mention, not doing their most electric performances live LIVE, BLACK, PORCH. But since it's their only live DVD, it's better than nothing.

Eddie V introduces a lady who ""signs"" the song for the deaf, and to see her signs and movements is simply amazing.  Eddie V even does an impromptu dance with her at the end of the song.  Simply grand.  The second instance is ""Daughter"".  The band launches into a tune at the end whose refrain states, ""It's OK, I still love you anyway.""

So I'm predisposed to like this, but it's worth a look for anyone who's ever wondered what a PJ concert is like.  Yes, with the possible exception of Dave Matthews, they are THE BEST live act still touring today.  Poseurs such as Creed reveal themselves to be studio bands when they step on stage, but PJ is the real deal--a true BAND that earned its chops playing live, and it shows. Ed has toned down his stage act since the Ten / Lollapalooza days, but he's still a great performer.  The sonic attack of Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, two great guitarists who don't get much press, is as strong as ever, ably accompanied by Jeff Ament on bass.  The real plus is Matt Cameron on drums--even though I miss Jack Irons, Matt is a great, great drummer, and he gets his due on this disc with a ""Matt-cam"" feature that focuses on him for the entirety of the song.  With the sound up (at the band's request), this is almost as good as a show (ALMOST) and as good a souvenir as you're going to get.  I was at the ""Ice Bowl"" show in E. Troy last tour, so it was doubly nice, and although I'd have liked to see them do ""Baba"" from Chicago instead of RITFW as a closer, but you can't have everything.

This DVD brings the power and energy of a powerful rock show right into the confines of your home.  It is beautiful and is a must for everyone!  Some of the highlights are the Given to Fly and Rockin' in the Free World segments from St. Louis and New Mexico respectivley with Kim and Jesse.  Another reason you should have this DVD is that it is way over 3 hours long..., a great value from the best band around.  Pearl Jam is simply the best and Touring Band 2000 reflects their greatness!!!",989107200,3,574,4.277777777777778
1419446,5,B00005AX6F,"This is just like being at a Pearl Jam concert!  Over 2 hours of music tons of favorites and some rare gems as well, and just like a real show it leaves you asking for more- songs like Black, Small Town, Imortality, Spin the Black Circle, Preasent Tense and Light Years are missing. The songs are full of energy and often have unexpected extras (like sign language and little children) in them. The montages are emotional pieces especially the Band and the Fans. RVM and Go are amazing as are Better/nothing man. Watching this put a smile on my face for the whole 3 1/2 it takes to explore the DVD. A MUST FOR ANY PEARL JAM FAN, A GREAT BUY FOR ANY MUSIC FAN, & THE BEST CHOICE FOR ANYONE ELSE.  This is a great DVD.",988848000,4,716,4.218978102189781
1419447,5,B00005AX6F,"I cannot agree more with Neil Young that the DVD audio format is so far superior to your regular CD that it isn't even close.  I have an average newer stereo and it just blew me away.  During the In My Tree ""Matt Cam"" section I felt like I was RIGHT THERE next to Matt.  Just amazing stuff from a wonderful band.  I cannot thank them enough.",988848000,6,341,4.044776119402985
1419448,5,B00005AX6F,"Hands down, this is one of the greatest concert movie of recent years. It rises above the worthy competition of Oasis' ""Familiar To Millions,"" with exceptional filming and music. The camera-work here is excellent, providing the viewer with some amazing shtos of the band, and the fans. The band is at the top of their game, and puts on a quality show throughout the film. The ""Daughter/It's O.K."" number is reason enough to buy the movie, not to mention ""Rockin' in the free world,"" and ""Not for you."" Though the actuall film is excellent, several of the bonus features are lacking in substance. The two chief exaples of this are the ""Matt Cam,"" which interesting for about 3 minutes, and the video for ""Oceans,"" which is quite frankly not a very good video or song. Overall, this is an excellent concert film, but some of the added features are a bit dull.",988761600,,857,4.644736842105263
1419449,5,B00005AX6F,"Firstly I am a Pearl Jam freak. Like many others I give this DVD a five star rating for fans, and 3 1/2 - 4 1/2 for non fans. My initial reaction was huge dissapointment, because vocals sounded harslhy echoed and muddy. I messed with the DVD settings and finaly realized that my Tv was set on surround, which did not do either sound option on the DVD Justice.  After obtaining optimal sound I was blown away. I had seen the band twice before, and I really belive that this really represented a very true picture of this venerable band. Unlike Rage's recent, ""Battle of Mexico City"" which seemed very much like a stage reproduction of a ""Real"" concert. I was worried when I learned that most song were from dates, which I thougth would make it somewhat dijointed. The audion and video mix/fades were great(if one ignores the clothing changes). The show seemed to ebb and flow like the band, seemingly replicating one entire show. I won't do a song by song description. But highlithts were many, and the extras were great. A must buy for fans.",988761600,2,1041,4.537234042553192
1419450,5,B00005AX6F,"This DVD is awesome.  I was expecting it to be good, and it just blew me away.  The letter from Ed is really cool, and it's great to finally see the incredible video for Oceans.  The band is at their peak, and this is a great gift for the fans.  My favorite performances - Do the Evolution, Daughter, the Trilogy of Man, and Rockin in the Free World.  This might be the best 20 bucks I'll ever spend.",988761600,2,400,4.076923076923077

Over 2 hours of non stop music with bonus videos. It baffles me that Nirvanas unplugged is almost 5 star at 56 minutes with constant breaks and kurt cobain cursing at the audience.
