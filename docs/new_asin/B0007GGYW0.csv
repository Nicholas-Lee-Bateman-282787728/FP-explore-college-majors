8047320,5,B0007GGYW0,"Just for fun, I've invented my own ""Dream DVD Set"" for ""Leave It To Beaver"". (And, coincidentally, I also made use of a ""Beaver Lunch Box"" as a packaging option well before I knew Universal Studios was actually going to do the same thing for one of its first-season DVD collections of LITB; how 'bout that for precognition?!) ;)

Obviously, the following ""Mega"" collection will never ever get produced by Universal (or any other company), but I thought it'd be fun to stretch the boundaries of my fertile imagination and ""create"" from whole cloth a fantasy DVD set for ""The Beav"" and the Cleaver gang that would knock the socks off of nearly any ""Leave It To Beaver"" aficionado. Hey, you never can tell -- perhaps Universal will see these special-feature suggestions and decide to give us a few of these things in a future ""All-Six-Seasons"" collector's set. I wouldn't wager the farm on it, however. :)

So, in my wildest dreams, here's what I came up with that would represent my Ultimate LITB Collection.........

LEAVE IT TO BEAVER: THE COMPLETE SERIES: THE INCREDIBLE ""HOLY MACKEREL! MEGA SUPER-COLOSSAL"" EDITION:

ALL 6 SEASONS (234 EPISODES), PLUS SCADS OF BONUS MATERIAL, ON 38 DISCS.....

Bonus Features:

>> Audio Commentary Tracks (in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo sound) for all 234 Beaver episodic adventures by: Jerry Mathers (""The Beaver""), Tony Dow (""The Wally"" ), Barbara Billingsley (""The June""), and Ken Osmond (""Edward W. Haskell"").

>> 145-minute documentary on the making of the series, entitled ""Behind The Beaver"" (on second thought, the producers just might want to re-think this moniker). ;)

>> Original 1957 Pilot Episode for ""Leave It To Beaver"" (entitled ""It's A Small World"", with Casey Adams starring as Ward Cleaver); with optional Audio Commentary for the Pilot by Barbara Billingsley, Jerry Mathers, and Harry Shearer (who, at age 13, appeared in this pilot episode).

>> ""School Days"" featurette (13 minutes) -- Focusing on Theodore's schoolteachers through the years ... from Miss Canfield to Miss Landers to Mr. Blair to Principal Mrs. Rayburn. Particular attention is paid here to Beaver's first two teachers in the series, Miss Canfield (played by Diane Brewster) and Miss Landers (Sue Randall). It's no wonder The Beav had a crush on these two ever-so-fetching lesson-teaching beauties. I would have also. I'm surprised Beaver got any work done in class at all during those Canfield/Landers years. ~wink~

>> ""Wally's Girlfriends"" featurette (28 minutes) -- From Gloria Cusick, to Mary Ellen Rogers, to Carolyn Stewart, to the box-office girl from the ""wrong side of the tracks"", to Julie Foster -- all of Wallace's ""babes"" are examined in detail.

>> ""Where Are They Now?"" LITB cast featurette (24 minutes).

>> ""Tribute To Hugh Beaumont (1909-1982)"" -- A featurette all about Hugh/""Ward Cleaver"" (23 minutes).

>> ""Remembering Richard Deacon (1921-1984)"" mini-documentary (14 minutes) -- A fond look back at the career of ""Deac"", who played Fred Rutherford on LITB.

>> Barbara Billingsley ""Jive Lady"" featurette (8 minutes) -- With some behind-the-scenes footage of Barbara's hilarious role in 1980's ""Airplane!"". (Plus: Barbara's ""Jive"" talk in 8 different languages.)

>> ""Opening Theme Montage"" featurette (21 minutes) -- With details on the conception and filming of the six individual LITB show openings.

>> 12-minute featurette showing the second Cleaver house being utilized in other movie and TV productions...including the 1964 film, ""Send Me No Flowers"" and the 1955 Humphrey Bogart movie, ""The Desperate Hours"" (which enables us to see the house two years prior to the LITB series ever having aired (and four years before the Cleavers moved into their new home at ""211 Pine St."").

>> Episode Video Clip Montage (42 minutes) -- Featuring ""themed"" video clips from many LITB episodes. The ""themes"" explored here include:

1.) ""Beaver's In Trouble (Again)"" -- The Beav was always in some kind of hot water (or ""soup"") it seemed. Many of Beav's Earth-shaking calamities are revealed here.

2.) ""Ward's Best Tantrums"" -- When Ward scolds Wally and The Beaver, you'd better look out! :-)

3.) ""Eddie's Slingin' It Again"" -- Includes a string of many of Eddie Haskell's insincere compliments; e.g., ""That's a very lovely dress, Mrs. Cleaver"". :)

4.) ""Famous Guest Stars"" -- With clips of some of the familiar faces that popped up on the show from time to time, including Ryan O'Neal, Barbara Parkins, and Don Drysdale.

5.) ""C'mon Gertrude!"" -- Featuring clips of the seemingly-non-stop barrage of ""alternate names"" (usually female) that Eddie Haskell had for Wally -- nicknames such as ""Cornelius"", ""Gertrude"", ""Agnes"", ""Mr. Peepers"", ""Clyde"", ""Sam"", ""Isabelle"", ""Gladys"", and ""Stella"", among gobs of others.

6.) ""Dinnertime At The Cleavers"" -- If you want to know what's for dinner (or lunch), you can probably find out in this montage of food-related LITB snippets. From June's famous pot roast, to Aunt Martha's dreaded egg plant, to those darn brussels sprouts that Beaver won't touch with a ten-foot pole, to the morning when June mixed up the boys' eggs (gasp!), it seems that almost every episode had at least one scene when the family was gathered around the dining-room table.

>> Two complete episodes of the 1985-1989 follow-up TV series, ""The New Leave It To Beaver"" (aka: ""Still The Beaver""). That second LITB series ran for four years (101 total episodes).

>> Original Television Promo ads for LITB (via both the CBS-TV and ABC-TV networks).

>> Original TV Commercials, featuring LITB cast members.

>> Photo Gallery with over 450 behind-the-scenes full-sized photographs.

>> Interactive LITB Quiz, with 499 trivia questions about Beaver and the Gang!

>> Bonus Easter Eggs .... Including blooper footage, Cleaver house floor plans, and special deeply-buried ""Eggs"" which feature show clips of Larry Mondello consuming a wide variety of foods (that kid was always eating!).

>> 82-page collectible hardcover book, ""Leave It To Beaver Remembered"", with hundreds of recently-unearthed photos.

""Dream DVD"" Technical Specs And Other Miscellaneous Items/Sundries:

>> Video: Original TV Aspect Ratio (Full-Frame; 1.33:1).

>> Audio: 2.0 Dolby Digital (original Mono tracks).

>> Subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Thai, Japanese, Finnish, Dutch, Italian, Bulgarian, Greek, Slovak, and Swahili. (Think I might have overdone the subtitles a wee bit? LOL.)

>> Slim ""ThinPak"" cases for each disc.

>> Unique ""Beaver's Lunch Box"" Packaging. ""Lunch Box"" houses all 6 season sets, with each of the six individual season packs easily accessible.
