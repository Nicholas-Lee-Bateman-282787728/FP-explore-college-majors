Until you get to chapter 4. Isamu and Goulds voices are dubbed by different voice actors from the original dvd version. I don't know why they did this. It is one of the best English dubbed anime ever made. No loss of story from the Japanese subtitle version. Which is a big deal. They also changed a couple of lines while using the new people. Major dislike. Most people wouldn't notice it. But I sure did. Also. On the English dubbed version. If you put it on subtitles. It has Japanese lettering. A couple of my friends are deaf. So that's annoying.

What I did like. The packaging is amazing. I love the high quality box it comes in. It comes with a small book that includes artist sketches of characters and mechs. Very cool. The Blu Ray case is nice. And the movie plays brilliantly on a flat screen and high powered speaker system which I have. My friends who don't even like anime were blown away by the animation quality, music and story. The ending is tragic to say the least. Almost like a Greek tragedy.

For me the price was affordable. Even if steep at around $280. This movie is very near and dear to my heart. Reminds me of high school and friends at the time. If you are a fan of this series. It is a must buy.",1466553600,4,1379,4.21969696969697

8554741,5,B00ANIC62E,"The Macross Plus Blu-Ray set is totally awesome!  I bought it when I was in Japan this summer and watched it already.  I couldn't believe how amazing the picture and sound quality are.  It's Region A, so it'll play in America.  Also, the Movie version that's included in the set includes English subtitles!  That's a PLUS for anyone thinking about buying it that hasn't already seen it.  You can finally give away those old dvd copies from so many years ago.  It's time to update your anime collection!",1378598400,12,502,4.636363636363637
