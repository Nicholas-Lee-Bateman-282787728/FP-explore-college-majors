4197467,5,B003UESJHY,"Set in Lowell, Massachusetts, ""The Fighter"" is loosely based upon the story of two boxers: ""Irish"" Micky Ward played by Mark Wahlberg and his brother Dicky Eklund, played by  Christian Bale. The gritty blue-collar city of Lowell was the home of the famous writer, Jack Kerouac (1922 -- 1969).  I visited Lowell some years ago to see Kerouac Park and other related sites. I also remembered Micky Ward from the long nights some years ago when I watched boxing on television. Thus, I had to see this boxing movie which reminded me at the outset of a city and fighter I knew.

I was surprised that the movie doesn't as much as mention Kerouac, but he had died nearly 20 years before Ward's boxing career. Otherwise, one of the attractions of the movie to me was the opportunity to revisit Lowell. It still has resemblances to the city Kerouac portrayed with its old row houses, bridges, bars, and working-class population of various origins. The city has a larger drug problem than it did in Kerouac's day. The atmospheric portrayal of Lowell was realistic.

With its violence, brutality, skill, and sleaze, boxing and boxing movies are fascinating. Without falling into sentimentality, ""The Fighter"" captures rawness of the sport and tells a story of endurance, family, conflict, and love. For many viewers, Bale is the center of attention as the thin, tough-eyed and crude Eklund, a fighter in the late 1970s who had difficulties with the law and with addiction.  Eklund had been called ""the pride of Lowell"", a phrase I have also heard applied to Kerouac.  Eklund trains his younger brother and encourages him.  But he also tries to live vicariously through and to manipulate Micky. The mother of both fighters, Alice, played by Melissa Leo is also their manager.  She is cynical and controlling with her large family of daughters.  Micky, serious and hard working, has lost several fights and his career appears to be on the downs. But, when Eklund goes to jail, Micky gets a new manager who agrees to train his fighter on condition that Micky not work with Eklund or with Alice. Micky has a girlfriend, a redheaded bartender, Christine who sticks with him and encourages him.  The family dislikes her, and Micky's sisters call Christine a ""skank"".

The movie shows Micky Ward making a boxer of himself under the tutelage of his new trainer. He wins hard fights with determination, as the several (simulated) boxing scenes portray a fighter who takes a good deal of punishment as well as administering it before landing a heavy and decisive punch. But Micky is dissatisfied that his family has been cut out of the picture. For all their faults and manipulations, the family is close and Micky relies on them.  A diplomat as well as a fighter, Micky, his manager, the family, and Christine work it out so that all have a share in Micky's career and success.

""The Fighter"" is an outstanding movie which speaks of the importance of love, redemption, family and effort in the violent world of boxing.

4197468,4,B003UESJHY,"The Fighter is a blue collar biopic about Micky Ward (Wahlberg), a hard-nosed boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts with an affinity for liver punches.  Following the undulating path of his boxing career, the movie shows in the incredible familial struggles Micky had to confront in order to position himself as one of the most exciting boxers of the last 50 years.  Wedged between his brother Dicky Eklund (Bale), a former boxer who returned home a local legend after fighting Sugar Ray Leonard, a controlling mother (Melissa Leo) who is one of the most disgusting characters ever to ""grace"" the screen, and a caring but conflicted new girlfriend named Charlene (Amy Adams), there is pressure on Micky to fix everything, to make everyone happen, to live up to or exceed his brother's lofty reputation and win a championship.

What I liked about The Fighter is the fact that it's not a generic boxing movie where we see a little of the character's life, and then a montage of boxing matches.  This is supposed to be about family just as much - if not more - as boxing; and, in that sense, it accomplishes its goal because Micky often gets overshadowed by the rest of the story.  Whether that's because of Wahlberg's patented whispering portrayal or not I can't say, but the fact remains that The Fighter allows the costar and the subplot to take center stage.

The biggest downfall of any sports movie is a lack of authenticity.  Watching Tim Robbins rag arm performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bull-Durham/dp/B00005V9HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bull Durham</a>&nbsp;just about ruined the film.  The same could to said of Omar Epps as an NBA player in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Basketball/dp/B0010SB0CI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Basketball</a>&nbsp;- what is he, 5'9""?  In that light, I'd give The Fighter a solid 8 out of 10 on the believability scale.  Bale jukes and bobs throughout the entire movie - possibly more crack addiction related than anything - and Wahlberg trudges forward stoically with disregard for his face in hopes of landing one big body blow.  As an avid boxing fan, however, the left hook, left hook, left uppercut, left uppercut combination was just a little too preposterous to dismiss.  The rest, however, the sparring, the glove work, the patternless movements from light-on-his-feet Dicky, it's all genuine.  The only other issue I had with the film was that the three most famous fights of Ward's career - the epic war against Gatti - are left out of the story.  Those fights define Ward more than anything else, and would have served as a perfect reinforcement of the metaphorical hard-nosed demeanor expressed throughout the movie.

Aside from a collection of the ugliest actresses ever assembled on screen - portraying Micky's sisters - the cast is fabulous.  Once again Bale suffers for his career, dropping almost as much weight as he did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machinist/dp/B0007Y08QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machinist</a>.  Even a cameo by Sugar Ray Leonard rings true, as he comes off as friendly but also a bit aloof.

I don't know if I put it above&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-IV/dp/B0006GAOGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky IV</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Bull/dp/0792833236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Bull</a>&nbsp;historically, but the solid one-two punch from Wahlberg and Bale are enough to setup most audiences for the triumphant body blow of a finale.

4197469,5,B003UESJHY,"I recently saw this movie and came away incredibly impressed on a number of levels. Mark Wahlberg was apparently in training to do this movie for more than 4 years and it really showed as he was incredibly good when it came to the boxing technique that he showed. It felt as if you were watching a real boxer and nothing felt fake about it.  Another part of the movie that was quite authentic was the depiction of Lowell, MA as a city. Coming from the Boston area, I can say that it was quite good. The 7 sisters who were shown were totally hilarious---a real good look at what it is like for a family that has no options and has to stay home, essentially hang around, and depend on one person to be the primary earner.  Another great part of the movie was the underlying theme of crack addiction and what it can do not just to a person but to a family.  Overall a very solid movie and very worthwhile to see.",1292889600,3,909,4.182857142857143

This is a brilliant film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. This is a sport film / autobiography that is just as brilliant as other films of its kind. Mark Wahlberg & Christian Bale have brilliant chemistry together. This is one of the best films of the year and this is a film that will be remembered when Oscar nominations come around, especially Bale's superb Oscar-winning performance.",1292716800,2,3524,5.35740072202166
4197471,4,B003UESJHY,"Well, it is finally here, The Fighter rings in (pardon the pun) with solid acting by the entire cast. Who can deney Christian Bale's dedication to the Role of Dick Eklund who's claim to fame was a championship bout with Sugar Ray?Like him or hate him, most all remeber Bale's temper tantrum from the set of T4 that was highly publisized and ridiculed.

 You cannot deney the endless well of tallent that Bale brings to the screen and to his character. Not many have gone to the physical extremes as Bale has. Only an elite few such as Robert Deniro {Raging Bull},Charlize Theron {Monster} and even Sylvester Stallone {Cop Land}.From wasting away in ""The Mechinist"" to bulking up to a heafty 220 pounds for his Batman rolls, Bale again  sheds a good 50 pounds (or more) and submerges himself into the roll of Dicky as an unpredictable, crack addicted would be boxing champion.

Mark Walberg also puts in an equal effort as Micky Ward, Dicky's half brother. Torn between chasing the dream that passed his brother by due to his addiction,and to his family and mother who also doubles as his manager, he struggles through one bad fight after another for a shot at a championship. Not until his girlffriend gets him to get the courage to break away from his dysfunctional family and for another go at boxing with new management.

After a stint in jail, Dicky comes clean and the two brothers(differences aside) make for the ring again for what will be Ward's biggest fight in his career,his last shot at anything besides being a ""stepping stone"" to other fighters. Great story telling and superb acting makes this boxing drama stand on its own that is both equally moving and uplifting as previous boxing classics like Cinderella Man,Raging Bull and Rocky.

The fighter will have your attention from start to finish as it wastes no time submerging you into the bumpy life of Micky Ward and his steady climb to sucess. This film has had Oscar rumors mentioned, and I wouldn't be surprised in Christian Bale and Mark Walberg are not up for Oscar nominations as are other supporting actors of this film. Well deserved for its mention,but more importantly well worth seeing on the big screen.",1292716800,,2183,4.746701846965699
4197472,3,B003UESJHY,"As is the case with many inspirational sports movies, ""The Fighter"" uses physical competition as a metaphor for emotional competition. It's based on the true story of Lowell, Massachusetts boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward, who went pro in 1985, went on hiatus after losing four consecutive fights in 1990, and then made a comeback that lasted from 1997 until his retirement in 2003. His final match was a trilogy of fights with Arturo Gatti, but all events in the film lead up to an earlier match with Shea Neary. This change might have stemmed from a desire to make the film even more symbolic, Neary being from Liverpool and Ward fighting against the odds on foreign soil. I dare not make that claim with any degree of certainty. Watch the film and decide for yourself. I'm sure it can be interpreted in a number of ways.

In the film, Micky (Mark Wahlberg) lives in the shadow of his older half-brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), himself a boxer who fought Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978 and came home a legend. Now aging and in the throes of a crack addiction, we find a camera crew from HBO following him around, the director shooting a documentary about his drug abuse. He has nothing but his memories of that long ago fight, which may be why he feels he must personally train Micky as he struggles to make a comeback. But it's not merely a matter of personally training him; he never lets Micky make his own decisions about how a fight is supposed to be fought. When it comes to being in the ring, Dicky knows best, and that's all there is to it. Micky cannot get a word in edgewise.

It's even worse with his chain smoking mother, Alice (Melissa Leo), probably one of the least likable people I've seen a movie all year. She has appointed herself as Micky's manager and never lets him have a say in anything. For reasons never adequately explained, she deeply distrusts anyone who can train Micky professionally; reputable managers are out to steal him blind, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a traitor to the family. Behind her all the way are her daughters, seven of the most unpleasant, unlovable women ever to pollute the silver screen. Watching them with their mother is a little like watching a cult figure brainwashing her disciples. There's no better proof of this then a scene in which Alice and her girls simultaneously storm over to retrieve Micky from his girlfriend's house.

Her name is Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). She went to college on a scholarship but blew it by partying too hard and skipping too many classes. Now she's stuck Lowell tending a seedy bar. She and Micky immediately hit it off, but the same cannot be said about her and Micky's family. Alice and her daughters are convinced, through nothing other than rumor, that she's a wild MTV party girl. Charlene, tough and foul-mouthed, has no problem telling off Alice and Dicky, and it goes on like this until a very unlikely turnaround near the end of the film, when miraculously everyone is in Micky's corner. In her own way, Charlene is just as controlling as Micky's mother; both claim to have his best interests at heart, and both say whatever they can to prevent Micky from consorting with the other.

Have you noticed that I've said a lot about everyone around Micky but not so much about Micky? The film is essentially about a man who has been pushed around and lacks the ability to speak for himself. In this sense, the film is effective; we long for that moment when Micky will finally take a stand for his independence and make his family realize that his voice is just as important as theirs. Basically, he wants to get along with his family and his girlfriend. Why should he have to choose? When Dicky is arrested and sentenced to eight months in jail, Micky hires a new manager, who makes him promise to never again train with Dicky. At first, Micky agrees, for the arrest resulted in his right hand getting broken. But upon Dicky's release, Micky releases that being trained by his brother is important to him. Again, why must he choose? Can't we all just get along?

Despite receiving top billing, this really isn't a vehicle for Mark Wahlberg. The spotlight is on Christian Bale, whose intense, oddly rhythmic take on Dicky is convincing. We have by now become accustomed to Bale suffering for his art, and ""The Fighter"" is no exception; to play an authentic crack head, he had to his lose a noticeable amount of weight. We have also heard plenty about his practice of staying in character during movie shoots; true to form, he retained Dicky's powerful Boston accent all throughout filming. His performance is praiseworthy, and yet it's also in service of a contrived story that hits all the predictable notes. ""The Fighter"" certainly has its good points, but I have an unshakable feeling that its claim of being based on a true story is a bit of an understatement.",1292630400,6,4865,4.652325581395349
4197473,5,B003UESJHY,"The Fighter has been a must-see film of mine ever since at least the end of October. Not only did the cast look to function as one strong, cohesive unit, Christian Bale looked to transform himself yet again and had gotten completely absorbed in his role as Dicky Eklund. From just viewing the trailer, Bale seemed to give a performance that reminded his fans just how talented he can actually be. The Fighter also seemed to have a lot of emotion and heart; two key ingredients that go on to making movies like this legendary. The real test would be if The Fighter could hold up to other great boxing films like Rocky or Raging Bull and in this critic's humble opinion, it does just that.

Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) is following in his brother Dicky's (Bale) footsteps and is trying to make a name for himself as a boxer. Dicky has been giving Mickey advice and helping Mickey train for as long as they can both remember while their mother Alice (Leo) has been acting as his manager the entire time. Mickey knows it's time for a change if he expects to make a serious impact in the boxing world, but a crack addicted brother and a mom who thinks she's helping his career when she's really hurting it have both been holding him back for far too long. So when Charlene (Adams) and Mickey become an item and Dicky winds up in prison, Mickey makes the hardest decision of his life and keeps fighting with new management in tow and seemingly pushes his family out. As Mickey's mother tries to wrap her head around her son replacing her as manager, all hell breaks loose once Dicky gets out of prison. As the date for the most important fight in Mickey's career fast approaches, will he have the support of his family or has everything already fallen apart past the point of being repaired?

The cast is the driving force behind this film. The relationships and arguments that take place between Mickey, Dicky, their mother, her seven daughters, George Ward (Jack McGee), Charlene, and Mickey O'Keefe (as himself) are really the heart behind all the boxing that takes place. Melissa Leo turns in an emotionally powerful performance as you can tell she only wants the best for her family, does everything within her power to do just that, and still seems to wind up hurting them in the long run. Amy Adams character, Charlene, seems to want nothing more than to be with Mickey but is also relying on his success to be the ticket to her bettering her life. Then there's Mark Wahlberg who always seems to play the same role with the same thick Boston accent. The thing about Mickey though is that Wahlberg fits the part very well. The extensive training Wahlberg went through and his experience made him a shoe-in for this role. The real gem of the film is Christian Bale though. Bale has been rather disappointing performance-wise since The Dark Knight and it's nice to see him back in top form here. He surely looks the part as his awkward body language, sick, clammy skin tone, and the way he seems to be chewing on something when he's not eating anything really makes him come off as a genuine crack addict. I was beginning to think that success had gotten to his head, but even if it has it's great to know that he can still turn in engaging performances like this when he feels like it.

What's interesting is the song, ""How You Like Me Now?"" by The Heavy that was also used in the trailers for Faster is used several times in The Fighter. It seems to be utilized more efficiently in The Fighter though. It felt like the song was used in Faster just because it sounded cool, but the song seems to have a stronger impact in a film about a boxer trying to turn his life around better than a film about a guy trying to gain revenge for his brother's death. It was a very welcome addition to the soundtrack and makes the opening segment to The Fighter even more memorable than it already was.

The film also wastes little time taking full control of your attention. You don't lose interest until that screen turns black. With the little bits of humor thrown in for good measure amongst all of the family brawling and knockout punches being thrown around, it was just really easy to get lost in the film. It was almost as if you were part of the documentary crew filming Dicky watching this all take place in person. The one complaint I have is that it all seems to end rather prematurely. While everything does come together nicely, the ending just doesn't feel fully gratifying. It felt like the film ended right in the middle of the climax, but consider it a nitpick. It's still an excellent film.

The Fighter is an engrossing and emotionally powerful drama that features an incredibly strong cast and the best performance from Christian Bale in a long, long time. I honestly haven't liked a boxing film this much since Raging Bull. With all of the end of the year awards talk and so many movies being released recently and in the coming weeks that'll be potential award winners, it is well worth every effort to see The Fighter in theaters. It has one of the most well-rounded and well put-together casts of any film to be released in theaters this year and deserves to be seen on the big screen.",1292457600,55,5189,4.51009564293305
4197474,5,B003UESJHY,"THE FIGHTER

STARRING: Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Melissa Leo, Jack McGee and Mickey O'Keefe

WRITTEN BY: Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson and Keith Dorrington

DIRECTED BY: David O. Russell

Rated: R
Genre: Drama
Release Date: 17 December 2010
Review Date: 11 December 2010

I wonder if Christian Bale knows he's going to win the Oscar for best supporting actor. I sure do. His portrayal in The Fighter, of a crack-head who still knows the art of boxing in and out regardless of how messed up he is, was flawless and groundbreaking. There's no doubt in my mind he'll win, let alone be nominated. He lost an impressive amount of weight for the role and he steals the movie every bit as much as Heath Ledger stole The Dark Knight from him.

Mark Wahlberg stars as a Rocky-type underdog boxer from the Boston area, named Micky Ward. He doesn't have quite the loveable presence that Rocky had, but it's the supporting characters in his life that make this film amazing.

Micky's crack-head brother Dicky is his trainer, and his chain smoking foul mouthed mother, Alice (Melissa Leo), is his manager. Picture the family in the other great boxing flick Million Dollar Baby, who only cared about Hilary Swank's character's money. Micky's mother and brother are kind of similar, only they know he can box, and they hold interests in his career primarily because he's their cash machine.

The poor schmuck that Micky is, he's too nice to stand up to them and seek a new management team. When he meets Charlene (Amy Adams) however, she ignites something in him that drives him. She shows him what it is to have someone care for him regardless of his profession. This is perhaps the missing element that was holding him in place as a good fighter, rather than a great one.

We've seen a lot of the things in this film before, but they are handled with artistic originality and The Fighter isn't just another boxing movie. It's about family, relationships, dreams and life choices. And don't get me wrong, it's got a lot of boxing in the mix too.

Let's just talk about boxing for a minute. There's something very cinematic about it, isn't there? I don't even like boxing all that much, but I love boxing movies. It's easily my favorite genre of sports movie. Maybe it's the notion of one guy that we care about, taking brutal punches to the face. When we match-cut that with the obstacles he faces outside the ring - now we have two very dramatically entertaining elements streaming together throughout the course of the film. So naturally when our hero kicks butt and tackles all his demons outside the ring - we enjoy seeing him physically smash the last one to pieces inside the ring, in the climactic match that all boxing films must have.

The Fighter's version of this is one of the best I've seen. Right up there with Rocky, Rocky II and Million Dollar Baby.  Micky moves in the ring like we've never seen a fighter do before, and he dishes out some awesome combination jabs that shatter our ribs. As cool as that was, the boxing scenes aren't even the film's strongest moments.

The dialogue is so well tailored to the Boston crowd, that we feel like we grew up there, even if we didn't. I saw this with a good pal of mine from Boston, and he told me ""this is exactly how it is."" While it's rough around the edges, and more vulgar than a battleship full of sailors, it's entertaining. Watching these characters interact with one another didn't just showcase some of the best acting of the year; they were some of the year's best SCENES period. And it's just people talking!

Exactly how much of this is tied directly to the true story of which it's based, I'm not sure. And I don't care. Director David O. Russell, who also gave us Three Kings, has made a perfect film that will do well at the Oscars, to include possible nominations by Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. The Fighter is a film that no one really saw coming and just like a good boxer; it will knock moviegoers off their feet.",1292371200,,4004,4.574022346368715

4197622,5,B003UESJHY,"""Whatcha gonna do without your family?""

Every ambitious young man has felt the constraint. Maybe it is their hometown. Maybe it is their family. Maybe it is their friends.

Irish Micky Ward is no different. In this 2010 modern pull yourself up by your bootstraps, Mark Wahlberg shines as the overshadowed half brother of the Pride of Lowell. Just like in the retelling, most scenes are downright stolen by Dicky played by the incredible Christian Bale.

His complicated character appears first and last in the film. From the opening scenes of Dicky shamelessly showboating to his rocky path toward disregard, Director David O Russell's brilliant juxtaposition packs a blow. Just as quickly as Dicky seems put together, his goofy mannerisms are framed with heartbreaking vice and seemingly unkickable addiction.

It is not just Dicky, but the whole unit around Micky that closes in. Just went it settles in, the film changes on a dime. No longer about Dicky's elusive comeback (seems so simple in retrospect), Russell seamlessly tells the audience the real story underneath.

And like all good stories, a girl changes the calculation. After working up the guts to ask out the local bartender Charlene, it is the girl that clinches the interest. Nursing wounded pride, Charlene seeks out Micky after he apparently stands her up. It is not long before the inescapable hometown sings her less than desirable praises (she's into all girl manage a trois!) As soon as her views deviate from the family, the insults get sharper before the family brands her as unworthy.

Still, Micky wonders what he can possibly do without his family.

Russell in his steady direction could have settled into the story we know. The slow rise to the top with some minor speed bumps but nothing to derail him. That doesn't happen. Instead, even with the predictable path there are moments of surprise and uncertainty. More than anything though, the story continues to be about ""Welcome Home"" and what exactly that means. It could mean a drug house of dangerous temptations or it can be a career limiting place where demons need to be extinguished.

With careful aplomb the film reaches the third act. The heart usually resides here. With conflicting the woman who makes him strong and the family that keeps up his core, Russell again shows a well known story into a cohesive unit. Micky had to determine what makes him great while still transcending their inherent limitations.

Boxing films for the modern viewer can be very simple. Keep some of the standard fare and cliches that create timelessness. Tell the old story like its fresh. With dynamic performances, spectacular pacing and masterful storytelling, Russell accomplishes this brave new trail.

By its satisfying conclusion you realize there are few instances of the incredible. Theres no over the top heroism here. Nor is there any pressure to suspend your belief It is simply a boxer, taking a risk and willingly leaving the comforts of the familiar. With that, you cannot lose.

The Fighter is a knockout (sorry I had to).",1487635200,,3061,4.982352941176471

4197715,4,B003UESJHY,"Redemption by sport again -- see ""Hoosiers"" for another example -- but the old formula is given some vivid life by performances by Christian Bale and Melissa Leo as the brother and mother respectively of the eponymous fighter, Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg), who is struggling to make a success of his career from within a viciously co-dependent family.  Micky's brother Dicky (Bale) once a prominent fighter and local hero in Lowell, Mass. has become a crack addict and his whole family, including about six trashy sisters, seems to be doing nothing constructive about his downward spiral.  Instead, his mother, Alice (Leo), insists that she and Dicky can run Micky's career, as manager and trainer respectively, and it's not going well.  Dicky is so out of it that he can't show up dependably for training sessions, and Alice is making bad decisions about Micky's fights, and as a result, he's getting battered.  Then he meets Charlene (Amy Adams), a local barmaid who's trying to get her own life together and who sees immediately the co-dependent dysfunction in which Micky is trapped.

The most engaging scenes in the movie occur in the first half, when we see the dynamics of dysfunction at work -- Bale is totally convincing as a crack addict living on his past deeds, and Leo is a scary monster of a mother.  I won't spoil the details of how it all works out, but with Leo's character particularly one wonders about the plausibility of her development.  Mark Wahlberg is fine as Mickey, but he's more acted upon than acting, which is ironic given that it's his action in the ring that's at stake.  Amy Adams is a far cry from the nun of ""Doubt,"" and is very appealing as she battles for Micky's future in the teeth of his family's reluctance to cede control.  The last part of the movie reverts to formula to some extent, but, as with Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper in ""Hoosiers,"" there's enough compelling acting to keep you watching in horrified fascination.",1477785600,,1965,4.772861356932153

I expected all the usual boxing movie fare  the cliches, the unrealistic fight scenes, overly-elaborated love stories... Instead, I found unbelievably great acting, fight scenes that mirror the real-world bouts (I kept sneaking over to YouTube to check) compelling family dynamics and a romance on the side that was not too much, not too little, but just right. If there are flaws here, you really have to hunt for them. For 90 minutes, you're walking the dusty, beer-soaked streets of Lowell with Micky and Dickey or you're in the ring hoping that Ward can pull of his head-body, head-body magic just one more time. This is what a boxing movie should feel like. The music alone will keep you dancing and shadow boxing all night long. Go Micky.

4198329,5,B003UESJHY,One of my favorite movies. Based on a true story. Whether you're a fan of Mark Wahlberg or not- The Fighter is definitely worth watching!,1435363200,,137,4.52
4198330,5,B003UESJHY,"The Fighter
  Mark Walberg is one of the most appealing actors working today.  His particular niche, what he does well, seems to be portraying working class guys with more heart than brains.  He has the lead role as the boxer who has waited too long to make his break into the big time.  His mother, who ineptly acts as his manager, is a deluded woman with decidedly limited mental and emotional resources.  His older brother, trainer has a history as a failed fighter and a current devastating crack cocaine addiction.  He has a quintet of harpy sisters.  All of his family members have serious social, personal and intellectual problems.  They are all apparently alcoholics to boot.
 The love of a good woman, very successful actress Amy Adams, pulls him out of the family turmoil and puts him on the road to success, as so often happens in real life.  Walbergs best efforts, which are always and reliably quite respectable, would not alone make this a memorable film.  The writing is top notch, creating a whole canvas of characters, many of whom are worthy of being remembered.  One thinks of the character density in a Dickens novel for comparison.
 But the incredible performance of Christian Bale catapults an interesting, a good even, film into one of the best movies of the year.  Not since Heath Leger stole the show in his epic portrayal of The Joker has a supporting actor so completely captured a movie. In a reversal of fortune, Christian Bale up stages the star just as wonderfully as Leger upstaged Bale in The Dark Knight.  Bale plays the drug addict, criminal older brother to Walberg.  He simultaneously lifts his sibling up with his encouragement and good advice on boxing and sucks him down through his drug fueled erratic and destructive behavior.  Beal even looks the part, very thin and cadaverous like the walking dead man that he portrays.
 This four saw blade film, like many good dramas, is not much fun to watch.  But it does enjoin us to avoid bad behavior and preserver, which provides a good message.  The R rating is well deserved for drug use, language and adult themes.  The worth of the film may be judged by the slim $25 million budget and the enriching $88 million world-wide gross.  The public approves of this movie and you will too.",1435190400,,2273,4.713197969543147

Christian Bale is receiving his due accolades, but if you want to see Americas sweetheart Amy Adams stand up to a barrage of Southie toughie relatives, you will find yourself satisfied.  There is not a poor performance across the cast including Mark Wahlbergs humble and less showy role as the fighter himself.  @kmptop10",1427587200,,739,4.7952755905511815

4198515,4,B003UESJHY,"While it certainly isn't too original in it's approach to the material, THE FIGHTER is a technically proficient film with knock-out performances by Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. Based on true events, Mark Wahlberg plays ""Irish"" Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts who has a great aspirations but little so far to show for them. Christian Bale plays his brother, Dicky Eklund, also a (former) boxer, who trained him. He also happened to be addicted to crack and had numerous run-ins with the law. Even though the film had some great, intense boxing sequences, what really stood out to me was the dramatic aspect of it. The central conflict is drawn between Micky and his family who manage him and support him, yet somehow might be holding him back. The backlash that comes after he decides to start working with other people in order to get ahead felt very real, if a little melodramatic at times. Amy Adams also has a really great role as Charlene, Micky's girlfriend. But the clear standout of the cast is Christian Bale, who puts everything into his portrayal of Micky's wayward older brother Dicky. While Micky is most likely the ""fighter"" of the title, Dicky is no less a fighter himself who hits bottom and fights his way back from addiction. One scene in particular was really eye-opening, as Dicky is in prison and watching an HBO documentary about him (or at least he thinks it is). Once he finds out what the documentary is actually about, he makes a change in himself that has implications for the rest of the film. When all is said and done, this was the kind of sports movie that I like: the one that isn't just about sports. At its core is a family drama about two brothers that really hits home on an emotional level, even if it sticks to convention. I'd kind of like to think of this as David O. Russell's RAGING BULL. Overall, if you like a good sports drama or boxing movie, you can't go wrong with this one.",1423180800,,1940,4.577586206896552

4198609,5,B003UESJHY,"Mark Wahlberg made the movie happen, and then played the focusing maypole in the festival - around which danced various nymphs and satyrs.  The queen of the nymphs and the baddest satyr both won academy awards.  The rest of the cast wasn't far behind.

It appears that Wahlberg will make one substantial movie after another to the end of his career without winning an academy award - while others in the cast do.  Well they owe it to him - he provides the structure of the world they shine in.  Eventually, the Academy will award him for his body of work, and it will be well deserved.

The Fighter is a docu-drama par excellence - emotionally chaotic, touching, gritty, and satisfying.  Christian Bale buries himself so far into his character, he almost becomes a caricature - but not quite.  The Greek chorus of sisters ought to be considered as one actor, and also deserves an academy award.  Melissa Leo - aka: The Queen of the Night/Wahlberg's mother - also takes her role to the edge of caricature, but the Academy didn't make a mistake, she redeems her performance in spades.

Mickey Ward's fights can be seen on YouTube - watch them.

Not a date movie unless your date is Amy Adams as Charlene Fleming/Wahlberg's girlfriend.  Adams physical parts add up to 'looks pretty nice in the high school annual,' which means her spirit, her intellect must be of gigantic proportions.",1418860800,,1382,4.7125
4198610,5,B003UESJHY,"This is a movie about boxing champion 'Irish,' Mickey Ward. He and his family are emblematic of the Irish in America who still struggle to make it. Who have not yet economically arrive.

The Irish or Celtic people's historically have been a people who valued physical courage above all else. It was their ethos to live fast and leave a beautiful corpse. Even as far back as the days of the Roman empire. The Romans admired the Celts for their physical courage even as they waged genocide against us. 'Irish,' Mickey Ward the prizefighter is part of that tradition of physical courage.

More over, if you asked a historian about the history of the Irish diaspora in America he might tell you about Thomas Fitzsimmons a prominent Irish-Catholic who signed the Constitution, and who is considered one of America's founding fathers, he might tell you about the 140 Irish-Catholic's  who enlisted and helped make up some of the original 800 United States Marines when the Corp was founded in 1775, about the 'coffin ships,' about Antietam, Gettysburg, about how the Irish have arrived in every walk of life in America including piercing the 'glass ceiling,' of fortune 500 America.

What he will be less apt to tell you about are the Irish like Mickey Ward and those depicted in this movie who have yet to arrive. And who still live in neighborhoods that were once Irish enclaves whether in Lowell Mass, other parts of New England, or even some parts of NYC.

Historically the Irish in America were a people who because of the terrible discrimination we once endured, were fiercely loyal to our communities, our Church and towards our families. Again as demonstrated in this movie Mickey Ward was fiercely loyal to his family and to the Irish-American enclave of Lowell Mass. He and his family are emblematic of this as they are loyal to each other to a fault. And Mickey when he looses fights feels shame at having 'let down,' the people of the community he is so proud of.

All in all an excellent movie.",1418774400,2,2001,4.71919770773639

4198751,5,B003UESJHY,"f you are a Christian Bale fan, you are in for a treat with this film. Bales performance is tops. He is like an attention sponge in each scene, which puts the rest of the exceptional cast into supporting actors.

Director David Russell has pulled exceptional performances from Mark Wahlberg as evidenced by the outstanding film ""Three Kings"".  But Bale, playing a complete disaster drug addict older brother to an aspiring boxer, emits explosive danger in every scene and every line he delivers.  Now the ironic situation here is that Melissa Ward who plays the role of Bale and Wahlbergs mother gives one of the most over the top acting performances of the year.  Playing the role of a controlling, hostile, manipulative, aggressive mother, Wards character tries to control a pack of grown children including a husband who is not the father of many of the younger girls in the family and a pack of sisters who buzz around their mother like baby wasps around the queen wasp.  A queen wasp is the best characterization I can think of to describe Wards character who spews dysfunction and manipulation in every line.

It is Mark Wahlberg as the second son and promising boxer who is the character that transforms in the film as he tries to escape the psychological nightmare of his family and their influence on his sport. His girlfriend, Amy Grant, is a perfect match and appear to be an island of somewhat normality in this mess. However Bale and Ward steal the show in almost every scene  which was fine with me because they were crazy and self-destructive and certainly were entertaining to watch as they explode. But it is impossible for the viewer not to empathize with Wahlbergs character since he is emotionally tied to this family of one for all sensibilities and verbal aggression. His older brother is his trainer and he is both destructive and insightful making the story of emotional dependence even more complicated.

Now for a stunner, this film is the true life story of world light welterweight champion Mickey Ward. I was highly entertained and recognized in Bales pacting an uncanny ability to create a drug addicted petty criminal stick of dynamite performance.",1406937600,,2179,4.8544474393531
4198752,4,B003UESJHY,"If you think the movie is about boxing, you would be wrong...

It's about family. It's about grabbing and holding on to what is real.

Well done!

I wish they had about 20 minutes intersperced throughout the movie to show boxing training. After all one doesn't become a champion just by wading through family drama!

Mark Wahlberg plays the younger brother Micky) who works his tail off to get recognized in the fighting community and his Mother who lives in denial about the older brother Dicky and worrys only about Dicky.

4199169,4,B003UESJHY,"BioPics are tough. If you cover too long a period of time, then the picture becomes too thin in terms of dialogue. If you cover too short a period of time, then the picture becomes but a chapter and tends to have too much crammed in. Like I said, it is a tough balance. Director Dvid O. Russell (who just won praise for ""Silver Linings Playbook"") balances the story of suffering brother/boxer Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) and his new romance with the empowering Amy Adams played against Mickey's half brother Dickey (Christian Bale) and mother (Melissa Leo). Dickey is known as a former boxer who once fought Sugar Ray Leonard. Unfortunately, along with Dickey comes his drug addiction to crack and Melissa Leo as his enabling mother who is so proud of Dickie's past that she does a terrible job as Mickey's current manager.

Both Bale and Leo deserved the Oscar's they won which, by itself, make this a movie worth seeing. However, Amy Adams is also terrific as is the texture of the editing and the screenplay. The movie starts off by introducing the major events via a documentary that is being shot by HBO on Dickey. He thinks it is about his ""comeback"" to the ring when in fact, it is about Dickey's fall to drugs.

Regardless of what version of the film you purchase, you can supplement it by simply visiting YouTube. There, you can watch the original HBO documentary that details Dicky Eklund's fall into drugs as well as the fights re-enacted for the movie. Where the movie stops after Micky's 2000 fight against Shea Neary, you can also view on YouTube the Ring Magazine's 2001 Fight of the Year (Ward beats Emanuel Augustus), Ring Magazine's 2002 Fight of the Year (Ward beats Arturo Gatti) and Ring Magazine's 2003 Fight of the Year (Arturo Gatti beats Ward).

Like I said, Biopics are tough. David O. Russell nailed this one. It is well worth the time. If you like the sweet science (hello fellas), this is a movie worth watching. If boxing isn't your thing (hello ladies), there are two REALLY STRONG  female leads in Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. In addition, the women who portray the sisters/half-sisters are as tough as nails. Their real life nicknames are Red Dog, Tar, Pork, Beaver, Boo Boo and Little Alice. Damn, that sounds like a prison gang in which I wold keep my distance. But fear not as they only exist on your TV screen. Worth a rental, perhaps even a buy if the price is right. Enjoy!",1368489600,,2405,4.61214953271028

This is a movie of struggle and triumph over PERSONAL battles, and it is definitely on my list of truly excellent films.  Christian Bale's performance is nothing short of breathtaking, Melissa Leo is spectacular...both won well deserved Oscars.

Then again I don't really want to see a movie about crack addicts and how they bring people down.  The movie should have been called 'Crack', not The Fighter.

4199314,5,B003UESJHY,"NO SPOILERS | THE FIGHTER has Melissa Leo and Christian Bale manipulating in ways that are so subconscious and persuasive that it's hard to see.  Mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams become their characters as well.

The poignancy of the changing moments are invisible to the physically and (most important) MORALLY deteriorating junky, Dicky Eklund (Bale).  It's sad and chilling - the way such bankrupt perspectives can be sympathetic; but, the makers of FIGHTER find and dramatize these significant moments.  Seeing the lifelessness and perplexity of willful blindness in his and his mother's (Leo) eyes is disconcerting.  The subject matter of the HBO documentary lauded by Dicky Eklund (and his mother's misleading support) is a particularly heart-rending plot point.

In the scene in which Micky Ward (Wahlberg) confronts his mother, Dicky (and many sisters), with his love interest at his side (Adams); I found my mouth hanging open.  ""Academy award,"" I said, pointing to Leo.  ""Academy award.""  I pointed at Bale.  ""Academy award,"" I said, and I pointed to Amy Adams.

First, the director had filmed it in a relatively realistic and daily life style. Second, the cast as a whole gave a far superb performance. The family members, the drug addict neighbours and simply everybody with more than 10 seconds of acting were so into it. Rather than a boxing movie that branched into family and love matters, it's a movie about family and relationships flavored by boxing and the true story it based on. I am obliged to praise that the director had done his job so well. Actually the boxing scenes were at most average.

4199362,4,B003UESJHY,"Thematically, ""The Fighter"" brings nothing much new. America, as the boxing-obsessed nation, has produced many films on this subject - in Hollywood or elsewhere. But ""The Fighter"" (2010) is delightfully less saccharine than, let's say, ""Cinderella Man"", and at the same time more accessible than the acclaimed ""Raging Bull"". Still, just as both of the two, it is an artistic expression of a true story.

The two talented boxers - but first and foremost two brothers - are played by Oscar winner Christian Bale (in a stunning performance which speaks volumes without the character actually saying anything) and Mark Wahlberg, who cements his reputation with this flick for good. Their female counterparts are no less wonderful - Amy Adams is a joy to watch as Wahlberg's tough yet vulnerable girlfriend and the dependable Melissa Leo (""Frozen River"") hands in a strikingly believable performance of a pretty unbelievable character - a mother of nine and boxing manager rolled into one.

""The Fighter"" is predominantly a film about family (although not a family film), showing much compassion and understanding to its flawed characters, also offering a glimpse into sensation-seeking work of journalists (HBO this time).

Rent it or view it first, but most of you will probably want to own the film afterwards anyway.",1349740800,2,1315,5.193396226415095
4199363,5,B003UESJHY,"The Fighter tells the real-life story of junior welterweight boxer Micky Ward, of Lowell, Massachusetts.  In 1995 HBO produced a documentary, High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell, that chronicled the plights of three crack addicts.  One of its subjects was Micky's older half-brother, Dicky Eklund (played by Christian Bale, who won an Oscar for this performance).  Dicky was also a boxer.  He had ""gone the distance"" with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978 but has turned into a self-destructing wreck.  The wonder of the film is Micky's relationship with his family: his brother, who is his trainer; his dominating mother (Melissa Leo won an Academy Award for this role), who is his manager; her second husband; and Micky's six sisters (who still live at home and behave like a Greek chorus backing up whatever Mom says).  Then there is Charlene, his new love, who is as tough as his mother and trying to get Micky away from this crazy bunch.  This film deserved its acclaim.",1348444800,6,974,4.831325301204819

Another reviewer suggested ""Warrior"", which also an excellent movie, and similar to this movie, no doubt. But this movie did a much better job portraying emotional drama and baggage between the family.
I would buy this movie for my library.",1346198400,2,488,4.951219512195122
4199366,5,B003UESJHY,"While I don't know how much of the movie closely follows the facts of the true story it's based on, it certainly feels genuine. Everything about the setting feels real and one can easily associate with the characters. The acting is great - Bale and Leo in particular were amazing. Whether or not you like boxing, this movie is very enjoyable for anyone who appreciates great drama.

Micky Ward is a boxer trying to earn a living and succeed in the sport. His devotion to his family becomes problematic because his brother is also his trainer, and his mother is also his agent. Dicky Eklund, his brother, is an ex-boxer with a big drug problem. Micky's mother and sisters want him to succeed, but they don't always know what's best for him and have a very skewed perspective on things. After Micky gets involved with Charlene, a bartender, there are confrontations over his management and Micky is forced to make some difficult decisions. It was easy to sympathize with what Micky went through.

While some of the characters are likable (Micky and Charlene) and others tend to be reprehensible (Micky's sisters), they all evoke a strong emotional response. The acting and writing is very believable all around. Without knowing what the outcome would be, the last fight was entertaining and engrossing (and I'm not a boxing fan normally).",1346025600,,1336,4.855263157894737
4199367,5,B003UESJHY,The fighter is a movie that you have to check out. I was sucked into this movie from the beginning.

4199405,5,B003UESJHY,"Having been a longtime fan of Christian Bale ever since I saw Newsies when I was 9 or 10, this movie was on my to-see list for a long time.  The only reason why it took me until 2012 to watch it is because I normally dislike sports themed movies (boxing, wrestling, football, etc.)  I can say that this movie is not about the sport.  Boxing takes a back seat here.  This is about family and a really gritty but great beat-the-odds story.  My boyfriend enjoyed it, I'm sure, because of the punching.  I was surprised that I also enjoyed it.  I consider Christian Bale one of the best actors alive today.  I don't give a crap about the Brad Pitts, George Clooney, or any of those flat actors.  Think about it- when has Brad Pitt not played himself in every role?  Same with Clooney.  Christian Bale is multi-dimensional and that's why it is NEVER boring to watch him.  Think Gary Oldman- you can never recognize this guy in any of his roles until you see his name credited.  He is that much of a chameleon.  The only reason why Bale isn't on par with Oldman is because Bale is too handsome so he's easily recognizable.  His character seemed greasy and skittish and all throughout the movie I kept wondering why he was overdoing the movements but then we got a glimpse of the REAL Dicky Eklund at the end credits.  Bale hit that character spot on.  He moved and talked just like the real Dicky.  Just when you think he finally slipped up and ""overacted"" it turns out he was just entirely immersed into his character.  This guy is full of surprises.

From start to finish the movie is entertaining.  Only thing I didn't like was the typical captioned ending they always show for films based on true stories.  It would be nice to have seen that played out on screen.  Perhaps using the real Micky and Dicky as older versions of Mark and Christian.

Otherwise, a very enjoyable movie.",1329264000,2,1878,4.439882697947214

4199407,5,B003UESJHY,"At face value the plot of this film seems almost clichd - how a working class Massachusetts boxer, Micky Ward, overcame the odds to fight his way to a world title. A more novel twist arises from the fact that many of the problems that he had to overcome arose from his own family - an overbearing mother who insists on trying to manage him and a crack-addicted brother, Dick Ecklund, formerly a talented boxer with the potential to be a brilliant trainer wasted by his addition, which threatens to also ruin Ward's dreams.

The boxing scenes are impressively done conveying both the physicality and the strategy of the fights, building towards a deeply satisfying and moving climax as Ward's triumph is paralleled by, and to an extent catalyses, Ecklund's redemption.

The headlines and awards associated with this film went to Melissa Leo and Christian Bale - both deserved supporting actor Oscars - and Amy Adams' wonderful Academy Award nominated turn. However it is Mark Wahlberg's beautifully understated performance that is at the heart of this film. With it Wahlberg follows the footsteps of greats such as Robert Mitchum and Jeff Bridges into the ""you'll-never-catch-me-acting"" school of acting. It is this performance that holds the movie together and gives it its emotional resonance.",1327795200,,1294,5.070422535211268

4199531,5,B003UESJHY,"""The Fighter"" is very much in the mode of American sports movies, where the hero must overcome a tragic character flaw in order to achieve fame, glory, and victory.  In this case, the tragic character flaw is also the best part of the movie:  Christian Bale delivers an Oscar-winning performance as a crack cocaine addict who is pulling down his younger brother from boxing glory.

Christian Bale is one of the best actors, if not the best actor of his generation.  He was mesmerizing in ""American Psycho,"" and in ""The Machinist"" he demonstrates his devotion to his craft by losing enough weight to become skeletal.  But ""The Fighter"" is definitely Bale's best performance to date, and it's his performance which sustains and ultimately propels the movie.",1318723200,3,755,4.9603174603174605
4199532,4,B003UESJHY,"Its a pretty good movie.  To me the most impressive thing is the acting of Christian Bale.  If you are familar with him, he speaks with a very heavy british accent.

The movie itself is pretty good, only a little slow at times.  There aren't actually many fight scenes but the ones there are, are good.  Its very Rocky-like.

I didn't realize this movie was made in 2010, I am a little slow in staying up-to-date.  But when I watched it I immediately thought he should win an Oscar for his performance.  And, of course, he did win an Oscar, which just shows how good a job he did.  Mark Wahlberg is good here as Mickey, though he doesn't display the same emotional range as Christian Bale. All in all, the movie is good as a boxing movie and great as a drama with all-around good acting.  I really enjoyed it and hear a sequel is on the way.",1317168000,2,801,4.1688311688311686

The younger brother is insecure and easy to sway from people in his suroundings: his mother, brother, girlfriend, so called business managers.

I loved the fact that film shows working class family struggling to cash in on only thing they have - a talented boxer and his brother who acts as his coach.  Everyone is in it for the money, except perhaps Charlene, a girlfriend, college drop out and outcast from this working class town.  Charlene sees in her boyfriend a potential that should not go wasted and with fierce love she feels for him, she will do whatever it takes to protect his best interests even if it means setting up boundaries with his family.

4199535,5,B003UESJHY,"The stories surrounding this instant boxing classic is really what makes the magic happen. Mark Wahlberg spent over a year of his life preparing for his role as Micky Ward, researching the boxer's life and times in Lowell MA and training for this authentic portrayal. He gave place to Christian Bale, who found his niche in history with an Oscar performance as Best Supporting Actor in playing Ward's brother, boxer/trainer Dicky Eklund. Ward's Rockyesque rise from club fights to the world title is paralleled by Eklund's triumph over crack addiction. The authenticity of the flick was guaranteed by the true-life figures in the tale remaining on location in Lowell for consultation as Wahlberg sought to make this saga as accurate as possible.

For those who want to see Ward at his absolute best, get a video copy of his first fight with Arturo Gatti. It is an astounding ""Fight of the Century"" that would be the icing on a magnificent cake presented by master chef Wahlberg.",1315440000,3,978,4.891566265060241
4199536,5,B003UESJHY,"I know the mean streets of Lowell, Massachusetts, although of late that geographical reference point would center on a more literary sense of the place around the figure of 1950s beat novelist/poet Jack Kerouac. I do not, by the way, mean that I know Lowell from actually growing up in that old-time textile mill town that has seen better days, mainly. I mean I know Lowell because I know the double-deckers, the triple-deckers, the seedy bowling alleys, the back lot gyms, the mom and pop variety stores, the ethnically-tinged bars, biker hang-outs, and flop houses that dot that working class town and form the backdrop to the cultural life of that place. I grew up on the southern side of Boston in North Adamsville. That past its prime working class town (formerly a shipbuilding center rather than Lowell's textile but they shared the same ethos) had its full compliment of tight housing, rundown stores, sparse entertainment possibilities and cramped view of life's prospects just like Lowell.

I know Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) and, more importantly, I know Dickie Eklund (Bale) and their mother Alice (Leo). I do not mean that I know any of them personally but I know their ilk. See North Adamsville also had its fair share of club fighters (or other sports king wanna-bes), working out of some third floor back door gym that smelled of tiger's balm and other liniments, looking to make it out of the dead-end town and on to the big tent, whether they actually left North Adamsville or not. And most didn't and most did not even get a shot at hitting someone like Sugar Ray Leonard down on some matted ring floor like Dickie did. Frankly, I spent most of my time as a youth being attracted too but ultimately trying to run, run very hard, away from the Dickie guys, the street-wise corner boys who fall sort of catching the brass ring. While they may be street-wise corner boys, unlike in this film, they are strictly bad-ass cut your throat for a dime characters best left behind. That was hard lesson to learn back in the day, and as the film makes clear, now too.

That said about the social realities of working class life what is there not to like about a film that highlights, Mickey Ward, one of our own getting out from under by sheer perseverance, wit, and his own sense of street smarts, mainly on his own terms. And to be a bloody stubborn Irishman to boot. Some of the stuff concerning his family connections, his eight million family connections, the ""us against the world (you do not air your dirty linen in public, period)"" while hard to take at points rang true. As did many of the confrontation scenes with Mickey's high-flying girlfriend Charlene, when she tried to break her man out of the family's grip. Finally, the acting from Wahlberg's conflicted (between family and career, between being a ""stepping stone"" and a champ) boxer, to Bale's mad monk ex-boxer who had gone a long way down from those Sugar Ray days (a not uncommon fate for those who are just not good enough to wear the crown, whatever the crown might be) to Leo's (Alice)one-dimensional family worldview (with nine kids, seven of them girls, that might have been the beginning of wisdom in her case) was uniformly fine. Still, I am glad, glad as hell that I made a left turn away from those corner boys down in the streets making all that noise. But it was a close thing, no question.",1315267200,,3376,4.653266331658291

4199550,5,B003UESJHY,"A movie that finally proves feel good sports movies about under dogs don't have to be clean, campy, and follow the same outlines as all the rest. The fighter is a real world gritty movie about a boxer who has to do as much fighting outside the ring as in to prove himself.

Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a down on his luck man from Lowell Mass. Working construction he begins to plan a come back as a boxer. Trained largely by a family friend and his junkie brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), he begins to talk up his come back around town. When Ward's come back doesn't go as planned he nearly gives up on his dream until his new girlfriend Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams) fills the role of a supportive, loving person in his life that no one has really stepped into before. Ward is constantly in his brother's shadow and it is clear who the family favorite is. Ward's emotional battle out of the ring is tougher than the physical trials he endures during his fights.

The Fighter is a great movie that blends family, boxing, drama, and comedy perfectly. It is clear this movie always had a strong script and David O. Russell did a phenomenal job directing but the cast really brings it to the next level. Wahlberg and Bale have excellent chemistry on screen. Adams projects a strong and independent woman who isn't afraid to stare down Ward's seven sisters or his over bearing mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo). There is no weak link in the cast and choosing one that stands above the rest isn't easy. An amazing cast like this can carry any average movie but The Fighter is something more.

The Fighter is still an underdog story but it doesn't seem to be the same fill-in-the-blank as every other sports movie that gets churned out. The town of Lowell Mass is brought to life by the vibrant and real characters. It is not a cookie-cutter suburbia or a friendly town that holds Ward on their shoulders like in the sequel to the Rocky movies. Ward is a flawed character and his family is worse. These flaws make them characters and not just players in the game. Plenty of scenes develop the characters, the town, and the struggle that Ward had to face everyday without being over bearing or taking anything away from the plot.

An amazing story with real characters this movie isn't just for boxing fans. The sport is Ward's ambition but the fight the title refers to involves every aspect of his life.",1313107200,5,2405,4.534562211981567

4199552,3,B003UESJHY,"3.4 stars

I enjoyed this film, but as with last year's wrestling flick with Mickey Rourke, I wasn't blown away as so many others were. First off, despite the accompanying making-of doc showing how much Wahlberg trained to be a believable fighter for this, I just don't buy him as a boxer of this calibre. He's too slow and just doesn't feel like a contender. I've watched fights since the early '70s and know a great fighter, or even a reasonable facsimile; Marky Mark ain't one of 'em. Even Will Smith as Ali was more believable.

Second, Bale is good but once again I just couldn't buy him as the crackhead he's supposed to be. I live around a lot of crackheads, watch them walk by my place daily and have seen thousands come and go over the last decade...and Bale just don't pass. He feels like an actor, as does Wahlberg. And this feels like a film. Which is all fine, as they are actors and this is a film, but the cinematic revelation others describe here never happened for me.

All in all, I wouldn't put this anywhere near the pantheon of great fight flicks like The Set-Up, Raging Bull and so many others. It's a good film, though throughly depressing despite the ""happy"" ending, and my main problem was not the acting or the decent direction, it was that I found none of these characters worth rooting for. They just weren't appealing on almost any level. Maybe that's just me, but in the end I need to like the hero or heroes, and here it wasn't happening.

If you like the actors or boxing, you might like this, but I'd never watch it again.",1311552000,,1555,4.407665505226481
4199553,4,B003UESJHY,"Based on a true story, `The Fighter' is the story of two brothers, Micky Ward (Wahlberg) and Dicky Eklund (Bale) who are boxing heroes around their home town of Lowell in the USA.

Dicky is renowned for his past boxing career, but has fallen on hard times after becoming addicted to crack. Micky is his younger brother who wishes to emulate and surpass Dicky's success and make a name for himself and his family. Dicky's addiction overshadows his brothers chances of getting respected fights and when he ends up in prison it gives Micky the opportunity get a new support team and start to turn things around. But it is when Dicky finally gets clean, gets released from prison, makes amends with Micky and the family and rejoins his brothers team, that everything really comes together and things take a final upward spiral.

This film has excellent performances from all involved and Bale and Wahlberg are exceptional as the main characters. Micky's girlfriend Charlene is a stabilising influence in his life and the actress who plays her is also really good. This film has a superb soundtrack with tracks by The Rolling Stones, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Whitesnake and way more besides, it really lifts certain scenes in the film.

The fight scenes are well choreographed and make for a good mixture of tension and excitement and the director manages to make everything look authentic.

It is hard to fully warm to some of the characters, but you always appreciate where they are coming from and the influence and impact they have in each others lives. This is a great story of perseverance and overcoming adversity to reach your dreams and for this alone it is quite inspiring. I admit I have seen better bio-pics of this type, but this is perfectly watchable and makes for just under 2 hours entertaining viewing. This well worth checking out at some point.

4199554,3,B003UESJHY,"I read the build up to this film's release. I must say I'm disappointed in the final product. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor. Whether he thought he could carry the whole project on his persona? Or, the project was hamstrung by limited finances. The film never drew me in, & made me believe the characters. Bayle's interpretation of a crack addict needs work, IMHO. Wahlberg never seems to put his heart into this role 100%. The cinematography looks budget minded. Some of the scenes look like they were laid out in w/only a few minute's thought. They may have been trying for an up close, more street level feel to the movie. They didn't make it. Lastly, the fight scenes @the end had some very unrealistic choreography in them.

It's too bad. The true story behind the pic is strong. They had some good actors in it. It never became more than the sum of its parts. I don't think it really even measured up to the sum of its parts... Hey, they're only human. I imagine it's a fine line between hitting a home run, or a dud. Some of the dynamics between his girlfriend & his family were the most believable parts of the film. Ah Well... Sorry Marky Mark. You didn't do it this time. Learn from some of Afleck's mistakes. Don't keep going back to Southy for roles. You won't be challenged to step it up. Your fans won't buy the weak performance.",1311379200,,1342,4.411290322580645
4199555,3,B003UESJHY,"Okay, I agree that Christian Bale AND Melissa Leo both deserved the Oscars they won for this movie.  BUT...I really couldn't stomach most of this movie BECAUSE of their performances.  They both played seriously dysfunctional people and they were just too difficult to watch for the entire length of this film.

I wish I could have seen more of Mark Wahlberg in his role as ""Irish"" Micky Ward.  I thought this movie was about his fighting comeback.  Instead I got close to two hours of dysfunctional family.",1311120000,,506,4.7701149425287355
4199556,4,B003UESJHY,"I am not really into fighting movies although I, of course, watched the Rocky series back in the day and cried watching Million Dollar Baby. This movie was different, and kind of confusing at the beginning. I won't go into details about the story itself, so many have already done that here. But I will commend every actor in this movie! Every one! From the 'typical east coast 1990's sisters' to the friends of the family and townies, I felt like I was back in the northeast!

Mark Whalberg was handsome as ever and pulled off his accent really well, pretty continuously. I enjoyed him as the fighter who wanted another chance, to change his life and get his daughter back, make money at something he's never made money at, etc. His fight scenes, for the most part, were convincing except perhaps for the big scene with the body-shot, imo.  He was wonderful as the relatively patient, down-trodden brother of a crack addict and tough, mouthy mother-manager.

Christian Bale, however, steals the show a lot. You first have to imagine him in his Dark Knight role. Sexy, tux-wearing, smooth talking, just awesome. In The Fighter, however, he is totally different. You may find yourself asking how he looks so incredibly different. So very, not sexy or suave. He plays the part of a fighter wanting to make a comeback, though I'm not sure why it's ever eluded to really. He spends a lot of his time letting his brother down as he doesn't turn up to train him while he's out doing crack. But it's his mannerisms and energy that really make this an award winning role! So convincing and not a comfortable person to watch, per say, but magnetic the whole time. At the end I just kept thinking, wow, Christian Bale MADE this movie.

Overall, it's not for kids. It's got a lot of cursing, of course. Some blatant drug use and several sex scenes, one with what I'll call nudity.

I do suggest the movie as an inspiration, it's made me want the soundtrack for working out!",1311120000,,1962,4.594285714285714
4199557,3,B003UESJHY,"I was caught up in the film as the conclusion approached. It built up to the BIG FIGHT as (almost) all fight movies do. Of course, I'm not going to tell you how it ends; about the only reason I watched the whole film was because I did not know the ending.

But as the credits rolled and I began to think about writing this review it occurred to me that this film is just too ""cluttered."" That is, there are too many elements coming together. I know it's based upon a true story, but even excellent documentaries try to streamline.  The people who made this film, however, tried to cover ""all the bases"" (mixed metaphor), and the film lost its effectiveness, as far as I'm concerned. There's the domineering mother, the girlfriend that the family won't accept, the eccentric (but adorable) family, the older sibling who missed his big chance, the failing boxer furiously training for glory, and the hometown hero. Was there a ""plain"" woman who falls for the pugilist? What about crack addiction? How about a mobster who has his claws sunk into the hero? Is there a ""movie within a movie"" element?

but not amazing
My overall vote is this one is not a keeper, not a movie you need to watch over and over, and not a big enough Rocky triumph. You just felt like the lead character was going to get sucked back into the dysfunction as soon as the credits rolled.

Wahlberg actually boxes, not using stuntmen as he prepared to play Ward since it was decided he'd star in this (around 4 yrs ago).  Bale plays a great crackhead in his portrayal of Dicky Ecklund.

4199617,4,B003UESJHY,"At first, looking at the movie stills or the DVD sleeve, one may think that the `The Fighter' is a film on boxing. It is about boxing, sure, but David O' Russell's film is more about family, the strains of having one and the relationships between brothers and their fights.
A narration of Mick Wards (Wahlberg) journey to the welterweight title the Fighter is easily one of the best films of the year. Throughout his career which had signs of immense promise, Mick Ward had been falling short of the big title win. Part of the problem lay with the choice of opponents and generally bad advice dished out by his manager mother ( Melissa Leo) and trainer brother/ drug addict Dicky ( Christian Bale). Although Ward is aware of his greatness he is constantly hampered by the ties of his family and his obligations to them. He meets Charlene (Amy Adams) and things start to change. Dicky manages to land himself in prison and Mick decides to train under a new management thus setting him up for a confrontation with his family.
The story is driven by some fine performances by the entire cast but make no mistake this film belongs to Christian Bale; I think this is easily one of his best performances. Playing a former champ who once knocked out Sugar Ray, he transforms himself both physically and mentally for the role. His hollowed out cheeks and manic intensity inhabits the screen and threatens to drown out everyone. The Fighter may be Wahlberg but Bale gets to deliver the knockout punch, however it is to Wahlberg's credit that he does not get drowned out by this fine acting and stands his ground with an even performance in many thrilling scenes throughout the film. It may be easy to hate Bale at times but his goofy personality and his love for his brother shines throughout the scene. In the screen credits at the end, we get a peek at the real Wards.

The Film 4/5

It's not easy to make a movie about boxing. The fights have to look realistic and there's the problem of the plot.

Rocky won three Oscars and tells the story of an underdog who overcomes the odds. That's the obvious feel-good storyline that will suck in most viewers. Then there's Scorsese's Raging Bull, with two Oscars, which some regard as the best movie of the 80s. Clint Eastwood bravely showed the dangers of boxing in Million Dollar Baby and the movie scooped four Oscars.

So there's clearly plenty of interest in boxing among moviegoers. Is The Fighter in the same league as the three boxing movies mentioned above? What could it possibly do that hadn't been done before? The Academy liked it, nominating it in seven categories and awarding Oscars to supporting actors Christian Bale and Melissa Leo, but why should you watch it?

Like Raging Bull, The Fighter portrays real events, showing the lives of brothers Micky Ward (Wahlberg) and Dicky Eklund (Bale). The movie also has strong characterization. This is not a story focusing on boxing; it's a story about how the dynamic in Micky's family influences his career.

Early in the movie, we get a feel for how things will develop. Dicky is the focus of attention and completely overshadows Micky in every situation. Alice (Leo), their mother, clearly favors Dicky. She barely acknowledges anything that Micky says. The family group is completed by Micky's sisters who always seem to be shouting and trying to attract attention. The result is utter chaos when the whole family appears together on-screen. Instead of shouting even louder to make himself heard above the din, Micky tends to keep quiet. I adopt the same strategy when I'm in a room full of people that don't have any interest in what I'm thinking.

Dicky is famous in Lowell, Mass. for once knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard, but at 40, his dreams of a comeback have little chance to become a reality. He spends his time smoking crack and is unreliable. He's supposed to be training Micky, but often fails to show. Dicky and Alice arrange Micky's fights and match him with an opponent who is 20 pounds heavier. Micky takes a beating and loses his fourth fight in a row.

Micky's fortunes improve when he dates Charlene (Adams), who works in his local bar. She's intelligent, brutally honest, and actually seems to care about what he thinks. Micky's family hates her, but she's strong and stands up to their abuse. When Dicky is arrested and jailed, Charlene persuades Micky to work with a new manager. He is matched against weaker opponents and starts to win. His career quickly improves and he is given the chance to face tougher opponents for more money.

It's here that the movie starts to show real character development. Micky's confidence grows and he starts making more of his own decisions. Alice vows to be a better mother. The biggest change of all concerns Dicky. Prison changes him and he avoids drugs and starts to train. He wants to leave prison a better man and be a positive influence on Micky's life. There's a huge power struggle when he's eventually released.

All of the main actors turn in good performances. Wahlberg trained four years for the part because the movie was continually delayed. Bale portrays Dicky well and it's hard to argue with his Oscar win (although Geoffrey Rush gave a great performance in The King's Speech). Leo was annoying throughout, but that's the whole point. Her character was supposed to be the main cause of conflict. Adams did well with her limited role, but it was too small to merit serious Oscar consideration. She'll have better roles than this.

The boxing scenes look real and were filmed using HBO crews. Although he didn't say much, Wahlberg looked like a boxer.

What is the movie really saying? Is it showing us that it's never too late to change? Is it asking us to question choices between career, family and romantic partners? Is it saying that you should never give up on your dreams? It touches on many themes.

Video Quality 4.5/5
The transfer is strong in every department, displaying the gritty world of The Fighter accurately. Detail is good and colors look natural. This is a drab world, but it seems full of life. Take a look at bricks or clothing and it's easy to see intricate details.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix matches the picture quality. Some of the song choices were inspired and I particularly enjoyed hearing The Breeders' Saints included on the track. All of the songs sound strong and affect the mood. This is a noisy movie, whether it's a family argument, a bar scene, a street brawl or action in the ring. The surrounds will get a good workout and place you right in the middle of the action.

Special Features 3/5

The extras are all presented in full high definition:

Commentary - Director David O. Russell gives his thoughts on the movie and the reason behind some of the choices.

The Warriors Code: Filming The Fighter (29:57) - A good ""making of"" feature.

Keeping the Faith (8:33) - The real Ward and Eklund families talk about boxing.

Deleted Scenes (16:53) - With optional commentary.

Theatrical Trailer (2:32)

DVD (with digital copy)

The Fighter isn't an easy movie to watch. That's not because it is bad; it's a reflection on the subject matter. It would be hard to exist within such a chaotic family unit and it's actually painful to experience at times. The setting is drab and gritty and it's not a particularly pleasant journey. That's all intentional and is a compliment, but it's not exactly fun to experience. If you like drama, character development and boxing, you'll love The Fighter. If you just want boxing action, there are a few better options. Russell has crafted a good film worthy of its Best Picture nomination.

4199681,5,B003UESJHY,"The Fighter is quite a good film. The themes of family, courage, pride and rising to a challenge are well explored here and because these themes are so universal it makes a great story--one that is based on real life, too! Of course, this isn't the first film to examine these issues; but The Fighter does it all with panache. While the acting by the entire cast is superlative, Christian Bale steals practically every scene he's in as he portrays Dicky Eklund, a local boxing legend living in Lowell, Massachusetts. In addition, the choreography couldn't have been any better; and the cinematography left nothing to be desired.

When the action starts, we quickly meet Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), a mostly unsuccessful boxer being managed by his mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) and trained by both his unreliable, drug addicted half-brother Dicky (Christian Bale)and Mickey O'Keefe, a police sergeant in the Lowell police department.  Although Alice, Dicky and Mickey have nothing but the best of intentions as far as Micky's career is concerned, Micky is seen in the boxing world as nothing but a ""stepping stone,"" a boxer other people fight and almost always beat as they climb their way up the ladder. Micky yearns for a more successful career in professional boxing; and Mark Wahlberg's acting is so fine that I really felt for Micky.

Things become more complicated when Micky's life starts to change: he meets a gutsy young woman named Charlene (Amy Adams) who, although she is herself a college dropout, has spirit, a sharp mind and true belief in Micky's ability to go further in the world of boxing. She encourages Micky to take an offer to train year-round in Las Vegas; this causes a major upheaval in the family as Alice and Dicky are shocked and hurt by the realization that Micky just might go to Vegas to train for real--and this would mean they failed to help one of their own become successful. Things get even worse when Dicky is arrested and Micky's hand is badly hurt by the police when he is also arrested for trying to interfere with Dicky's arrest.

There are some very good plot twists and turns that I won't mention for fear of spoiling it for you; suffice it to say that the characters in this film experience quite a bit of action and soul searching along the way. Look for an excellent performance by Mickey O'Keefe as himself, a police sergeant in Lowell, Massachusetts who also trained Micky along the way; and Jack McGee does a wonderful job of playing Alice's husband George. Frank Renzulli plays Sal Lanano and Sugar Ray Leonard has a cameo in the film. There's also an interesting subplot about the making of a film about Dicky.

The DVD comes with an optional running commentary and there is a ""making of"" featurette that I particularly enjoyed.

Overall, The Fighter is a very good movie that I would recommend for anyone interested in gritty dramas based on real life events with action and suspense--as well as family issues being played out. Fans of the actors in this film will also want this for their collections.",1306800000,4,3056,4.767485822306238

The film offers an up close view of the incredibly depressing life of a bunch of losers in Lowell, MA, one of whom eventually manages to make it big. And, oh yeah, there were a few boxing scenes thrown in there. But there were no characters you'd be interested in enough to care about what happens to them. When the end credits rolled, my only thought was 'so what'?

Judging by the high ratings many other reviewers gave this, my opinion is apparently in the minority.  The only thing I can think of that might explain this is different attitudes toward dialog. So, if your idea of a clever, inspired script is one where the f-bomb gets dropped every 30 seconds or so, add another star to my rating.",1305417600,9,879,4.447204968944099

As a Massachusetts native, I enjoyed seeing the Lowell setting and I was oh so grateful that there were no God-awful, overexaggerated accents (I'm talking to you Diane Lane).

Great movie that even though it's a pretty basic based-on-a-true-story plot still delivers the goods with emotion, acting and directing.

As for Amy Adams, I remember when they announced she would Lois Lane for the new ""Superman"" film, and I felt disappointed and apprehensive. While I'm still unsure (I'd rather have Elizabeth Banks), she proves her mettle with this role! Bale especially shines as he doesn't act -- he IS Dicky Eklund!

4199727,1,B003UESJHY,"Any time Mark Wahlberg really wants something to happen, we should feel safe in assuming it must be stopped. After all, as the title of this review alluded to, he was the one who really wanted to have his own ""Funky Bunch"".

And so it is with ""The Fighter"". This time around, Mark's ""Funky Bunch"" is comprised of Amy Adams (who was actually quite good and didn't allow this clunker to spoil her tremendous reputation, even if it did waste her time), Christian Bale (whose greatest acting talent appears to be his ability to lose weight on command), and Melissa Leo (who I am supposed to pretend I've heard of before. I checked her filmography on Wikipedia; I've seen many movies starring her. For that matter, I saw her in ""The Fighter"" just a minute ago. Yet still I couldn't pick her out of a lineup if my life depended on it. Her performances are just that unremarkable.)

These four converge to make ANOTHER boxing movie. Yep, 172 bajillion boxing movies just wasn't quite enough, apparently. Never mind that boxing is a completely dead sport now (possibly due in part to all the boxing movies), and certainly never mind that Scorsese already made a boxing movie that will NEVER ever be topped, ever.

And where do you put your movie about possibly the most overworked subject in all of cinema? Boston, silly. The most overworked setting in all of cinema. Never mind that this movie has nothing to do with the central theme of ""Boston movies"" (the juxtaposition of encroaching modern leftist society and ""traditional"" American society). After all, you can always just juxtapose any two random elements in the film (Amy Adams' character and Christian Bale's character). All you really need is a juxtaposition and it counts as a Boston movie, apparently.

The plot is... and this is almost hard to believe... even MORE overworked than the subject and setting. There's a love interest, a drug problem, and an underdog story. That's it. That's the whole movie. They were a government conspiracy away from The Grand Slam of Cliched Crap.

I kept watching ""The Fighter"" because I would've been willing to sit through all its nonsense if the Ward vs. Gatti trilogy was pulled off well. It's obviously the only defensible reason for making a movie about Ward in the first place, and I honestly think it would've made a good movie all by itself. You call it ""Irish"", keep Micky as the protagonist, and let the dying gasps of boxing serve as your representation of ""traditional"" American society, thus making it a Boston movie. Wahlberg plays Ward, Gael Garcia Bernal could play Gatti, maybe a sportswriter played by Felicity Huffman to round it out. Just spitballing.

My spitballing, however, is more coverage of the Ward vs. Gatti trilogy than the entire 115 minutes of ""The Fighter"" was able to cover. Apparently there just wasn't room in a Micky Ward biopic to cover the only remarkable thing Micky Ward was ever a part of.

This film had a deep commitment to underwhelming, and it stands as one of the most generic Oscar pictures I've ever had the misfortune of watching. It also means that it's been over four years since Wahlberg's last good movie (""The Departed""). Unlike his character on ""Entourage"", the real Wahlberg's career won't be determined by the whims of a (mediocore) scriptwriter. To maintain a good reputation it's helpful to occasionally take part in a movie that doesn't suck. Whenever his name was brought up a few years ago it would conjure images of ""Boogie Nights"". Now I'm starting to think of him more as the guy from the remake of ""The Planet of the Apes"".",1304380800,10,3581,4.766129032258065

4199730,4,B003UESJHY,"The Fighter' breathes a bit of fresh air into the subject.  That isn't to say that the film is without its detractors, for it has those, but for the most part this is a fun and exciting ride that contains sharp notes that accentuate what could have been a `far too familiar' ride through `familiar territory'.

`The Fighter', which probably should have been called `The Fighters', tells the dual story of Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund; two brothers with similar dreams and differing setbacks.  Dicky was a onetime boxing champ who lives in his glory days by abusing drugs.  Micky, his younger brother, strives for a glimmer of what his brother had, but his volatile relationship with his family (namely his mother) make it increasingly more difficult for him to capitalize on his potential.  Once Micky meets and falls for spitfire bartender Charlene, his life starts to change and his career starts to take off as he begins to take pride in his own future.  But, family is always lurking around the corner, and soon Micky knows he'll need to fuse his two lives together.

There really isn't anything `new' about `The Fighter'.  The story seems rehashed from nearly every other `semi-popular' sports film ever made.  It is a formula that is rarely messed with (although it could use a facelift).  But, with generously crafted performances, a smart (and fluid) script and some keen direction, `The Fighter' feels far fresher than it really is.

Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg are sensationally good here, especially Bale who just tears into the scenery and his character with reckless abandon.  He inhales every ounce of character to be created and spits it out with every tick and reflex and emotional complexity intact.  With a character like Dicky (drug addled failure) there is no room for subtlety, but there is a need to remain authentic, and Christian Bale delivers flawlessly.  Wahlberg had the difficult assignment of not getting lost in the antics of the actors around him (mainly Bale and Leo) and he manages to do just that.  Amy Adams is also wonderful, changing up her own pace and taking on a character that is unlike any she's tackled in the past.  She is feisty and sexy and all around undeniable.  I loved the paternal warmth that Jack McGee was able to pull out of such a small role as well.  Now, there is much debate about Melissa Leo.  Yes, she was entertaining and engrossing and yet she was shamelessly skin deep and lacked the depth and complexity that the rest of her co-stars brought to the role.  I was not a fan of her Oscar win, despite the fact that her performance was `good'.

In the end, `The Fighter' isn't a total knockout, but it has something special, something extra that makes it stand out amongst a crowd of similarly themed films.  You can feel the passion in the film, a passion that is hard to fake.",1304294400,,2842,4.7105263157894735

Seems the Boston area has had its share of movies the past many years. Add this to the great pile of those. Melissa Leo played a very believable trashy and medling mother.

4199816,3,B003UESJHY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

With so many fight flicks out there, it helps to be a little bit different. The film's creator, Mark Wahlberg, wisely explores Prizefighter Micky Ward's family conflicts for three quarters of the film, rather than dwelling mainly on the conflicts in the ring. Wahlberg was attracted to Ward's story since they both grew up in large families, in a working class Massachusetts environment. For those who have no interest in astrology, I apologize, but I would like to point out that the natural inquisitive nature of a Gemini (Wahlberg), goes quite well with the laid back, easygoing Libran (Ward). What we end up with 'The Fighter' is an 'airy' concoction--a film that manages to exude a 'feel good' sensibility coupled with the strong dialectic between two brothers, whose mutual attraction and repulsion is constantly shifting.

Since 'The Fighter' is based on the true story of Ward's rise to the top as a champion welterweight, whenever reality weasels its way into the narrative, the film is quite absorbing. The entire scene where Ward, goaded by his mother, agrees to fight an opponent twenty pounds heavier than he is, and then gets his ass kicked, is something I've never seen before in a boxing film. Ward's brother, Dicky (played by a chameleon-like Christian Bale), also provides a great deal of 'color' to an otherwise traditional tale of pugilistic ambition. Who can forget when Micky ignores his trainer's game plan and adopts his brother's strategy to win the title fight? This despite Dicky's continual descent into the hellhole of crack addiction.

The bulk of 'The Fighter', however, is much more a tale of filial obligation (or should I say obsession?) than the history of Micky Ward's ascent to the welterweight crown. Why does it take Micky so long to realize that Dicky is actually holding him back? The answer in a nutshell is misguided filial obligation. A deeper subtext is that the Ward brothers are both in an unconscious incestuous relationship with their mother (played by an over the top Melissa Leo). While Micky eventually breaks free, Dicky takes a more circuitous route toward redemption. He must first go to prison where he finally overcomes his crack addiction and eventually allows his brother to fight without any conditions (that is, with Dicky no longer acting as if his brother owed him something).

I would urge anyone who has seen 'The Fighter', to also see Visconti's ""Rocco and his Brothers""--both films deal with two brothers who are prizefighters. In 'Rocco', the stakes are much higher: the successful prizefighter brother also has a misguided filial obligation to his now washed up sibling. Unlike Dicky (who eventually gives up his unhealthy family relationships), Rocco covers for his brother who has committed both rape and murder. Unlike the Visconti classic, Wahlberg is content to offer up a happy ending, where Dicky is welcomed into Micky's new boxing family, accepted by them despite all the past recriminations.

The three principals here all acquit themselves well. The most impressive aspect of Wahlberg's performance is his physical conditioning; he trained for four years to get himself into shape to play this role. Even better is Christian Bale as Dicky. Bale lost approximately sixty pounds to play Micky's crack-addicted brother; when you first see him, you won't even realize it's Christian Bale. Amy Adams finally breaks out of her 'good girl' roles and plays a sexy, working class gal who helps Micky break his ties with his mother.

Less successful is Melissa Leo as Alice Ward, the mother of the seven daughters. Yes, we get the idea that she's a control freak, but does all that 'control freak' stuff have to repeat itself ad infinitum? The daughters (described by many critics as a virtual ""Greek Chorus""), provide additional cartoonish machinations; the stale comic relief reaches its apotheosis in the scene where the daughters try and pummel Micky's girlfriend, Charlene.

Micky Ward's victory during the Championship Fight in London seems a bit anti-climactic. Wahlberg went to great lengths to reproduce the actual fight as it appeared on HBO in 2000. The actual recording of the HBO announcers was utilized during the film and the fight sequences were choreographed to match the actual movements of the boxers. It just seems kind of lazy to pad the end of your film with the reproduction of an actual event, which you could probably better enjoy by watching the real thing.

'The Fighter' probably would have worked better had it been cut down by about 20 to 30 minutes. A good number of the scenes feel as if they're improvised and sometimes drag a bit. Nonetheless, the holy trinity of Wahlberg, Bale and Adams, make this fairly traditional boxing yarn, entertaining. Wahlberg stays true to his Gemini sign--there is something for everybody here: whether it be over the top acting performances, intense family conflict with incestuous undertones and gritty recreations of fighters plying their trade in the ring.",1303689600,4,5036,5.066344993968637

Mark Whalberg is also amazing as his brother who was one of the most underrated fighters of the last 25 years.  His inner struggle between wanting success and wanting to be loyal to his family but also feeling the need to succeed and seeing that his family may be what is holding him back.

Based on a true story, David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" is a knockout sports drama filled with finely drawn characters and crackerjack performances.  The movie netted two of its actors - Christian Bale and Melissa Leo - a pair of richly deserved Best Supporting Oscars for their efforts.

In the role he was clearly born to play, Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward, a welterweight boxer who, after quite a few years in the ring already, is still trying to make a name for himself as a fighter.  Perhaps the greatest hindrances to Micky's success are his mother, Alice (Leo), and his older brother, Dicky (Bale), the former a hard-living, tough-talking broad who takes it upon herself to manage - and mismanage - her son's career, and the latter, a crack-addicted has-been pugilist himself whose one claim to fame is taking out Sugar Ray Leonard in a bout in 1978 (Leonard makes a brief appearance as himself in the film).  Now Micky is beginning to question whether he wouldn't be better off just cutting the family ties altogether and taking charge of his own affairs, especially when a well-reputed professional trainer offers to take him on as a client.  But how will that sit with a mother and a boatload of siblings who prize familial loyalty above all else?

Set in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1993, ""The Fighter"" brings its low-income, working-class milieu to vivid life.  In addition to the thick Boston accents and mercilessly teased hair, ""The Fighter"" features what is probably the strangest, least ""Hollywood"" looking cast of secondary players I've ever seen in a mainstream movie.  This is particularly the case with the women cast to play Micky and Dicky's seven unmarried sisters, all apparently still living at home, who serve as a kind of roving posse, eager to avenge any slights made against the family honor by outside forces, including Micky's highly opinionated new girlfriend, the tough-as-nails bartender Charlene (the superb Amy Adams), who isn't about to back down from this band of screeching white-trash banshees when it comes to doing what she thinks is best for Micky.

So dazzled are we by the riveting, award-winning performances of Bale and Leo that Wahlberg's beautifully understated work as Micky could easily get lost in the shadows.  But it is he who gives the movie its emotional center, turning Micky into a character whose fate and welfare we come to care deeply about.  If nothing else, his subtle, self-effacing way of coping with all the craziness and drama taking place around him provides a necessary counterweight to the showier performances - and immediately puts us in his corner.  It also helps that Micky is being torn in so many different directions at once, when all he really wants is to finally get a chance at a title bout.  Jack McGee, the roly-poly fire chief from ""Rescue Me,"" also scores as Micky's tirelessly supportive father, George.

There's a definite toughness and a take-no-prisoners mentality to this clan, but also a closeness and a strangely admirable loyalty among its members that go a long way towards smoothing out some of those rougher edges.  They're not necessarily people one would want to meet or have much to do with in real life, but as characters in a drama, they sure are fascinating to watch.",1302566400,2,3280,4.9041591320072335

4199865,2,B003UESJHY,"Not a treat for the boxing fan, it's just too dramatic and focuses on the family drama surrounding a crack addict. There's barely any action, suspense, romance, or comedy in it (or boxing for that matter). The best part of the film is the original HBO footage of the older brother fighting. The preview is a huge spoiler too, I can't recommend this film, it's mildly entertaining with a good cast, but the parts of the story they choose to focus on were quite unappealing for a boxing fan like me. The choreographed fight scenes are pretty unrealistic as well, all in all left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",1302134400,,609,4.446428571428571

4199879,5,B003UESJHY,"To much focus was on mickey's brother Dicky.....i don't know why they did this. They could have done so much with this movie. Shown actual footage from real fights, use black and white, flash backs, show more moments between brothers since that seemed to be the big theme of this movie as well as a real life Rocky figure. It seemed that I saw more of Dicky the brother in jail, and in a crack house than i did of mickey fighting.

They had so much potential to really make this an epic film with these guys still alive. The movie was short, they had time to add parts of his real life fights, interviews, and what happened to him  after he won the belt as well....

Many people also wonder what happens to the hero in the boxing ring who just won the world belt........i would have liked to see how they were doing financially, meaning could they retire and just train fighters for life. Could they live out the remainder of their lives living easy especially since their life was so hard? And they really did have it difficult in  my humble opinion. I am never looking for an epic masterpiece, I am just looking to be entertained one way or another.  If I feel the movie went to fast, or If I feel I wish the movie could have gone on longer, then I know I have been entertained.

So, I don't want to give anyone the impression I did not like it or wasn't entertained.  I did love the movie, and I think they did a good job. I own this movie for a reason. I just think they could have done more with it. But it really does have it's moments, and Bale and Wahlberg did a fantastic job.

I just felt it was a movie about dicky a bit more and not the champ Mickey.  To much screen time for Bale, and Wahlberg, not enough.  It was a little bit of a let down, but nothing that prevents you from enjoying this movie and it's theme. It is  still worth every dime to watch.....

I gave it 5 stars because I was really entertained the whole time. I just say a little let down because it was a missed opportunity here. But loved the movie all the same.

4199882,4,B003UESJHY,"what interested me in this movie was the development of welter-weight fighter ""Irish Micky Ward"" within the tight circle of his family, especially with his older brother Dickey (Christian Bale). This blue collar Lowell Massachusetts family, seemingly under the authoritarian matriarch Alice, is both tight-knit as well as dysfunctional. The older son, Dickey, once had a claim to fame as ""The Pride of Lowell"" years ago when he went up against Sugar Ray Leonard, possibly knocking him down (or did he slip?), yet ultimately lost to him. Dickey never seems to be able to move past this moment in his life, constantly referring to it, and he is now so hopelessly mired in a crack addiction that he is of no use to brother or even to himself. Mom doesn't want to see the truth of this, and insists that Dickey and only Dickey should train Micky, and even Micky seems to believe this. (the group of five (!) sisters) form a ""Greek chorus"" of supporters; it's weird, everyone seems to live through Micky). Truth is, as much as they love each other, his family is bringing him down.

I think there is an undercurrent of rivalry between the two boys, as Dick who was a competent fighter and taught Micky everything he knew could never let go of the fact that he was ""almost great"", and when Micky followed in his footsteps, Dickey taught and encouraged him, yet at the same time seemed focused on himself. I was left to wonder if he truly DID want Micky to win, or if he was subconsciously afraid of being upstaged by his little brother.  Micky, for his part, wants to imitate and surpass his brother's success.

Christian Bale, gaunt and hyper, is quite convincing as the troubled Dick Eklund. Dick has a young son who appears to live with Alice (everyone appears to live with Alice). So he is not much of a father. Also derelict in his work attendance, he turns to crime to support his crack habit. Eventually this lifestyle catches up with him, and he is imprisoned (again), and painfully dries out from the drugs while incarcerated.

 During this time, Micky has the opportunity to take on a new, more reliable trainer and manager, but they insist that Micky leave his family out of the business. Micky also makes a girlfriend in feisty barmaid Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), although his fam does not approve. The heart of the movie is how Micky learns to choose for himself what is best for his own life and career, yet, in the end also to honor his family. He manages to move forward and win many fights while Dick is in prison. A big moment of conflict at the end is whether he will follow through with the plans that his trainer taught him in the big fight for World Champion in England, or whether he will follow his brother's advice with a most unusual game plan. This shows how he has finally matured as a fighter and as a person to be able to think and choose for himself.",1301788800,,2877,4.535645472061657
4199883,4,B003UESJHY,"I am normally not a big fan of Christian Bale but he is the true star of this movie.  His Academy Award for ""Best Supporting Actor"" was well-deserved!  Like another reviewer said, it can be argued that the movie is more about Dicky, Micky's older brother, played by Christian Bale.  He is a former fighter whose claim to fame is that he ""knocked out"" Sugar Ray Leonard and put ""Lowell(MA) on the map"" as a result.  But now, he is a crack addict who is also the trainer for his younger brother, Micky.  Micky also comes from a huge Irish Catholic family with 5 or 6 sisters and a mom who acts as his manager.  The actress that played his mother should have also won an Academy Award.  She is a mother that refuses to ""see"" that Dicky is a drug addict and makes it pretty clear that Dicky is her favorite son.  She is also Micky's manager although she often makes poor decisions that hurt his boxing career. Finally,yes, the story is predictable: man is down-and-out, meets a pretty girl, and gets determined to FIGHT and WIN. But hey, it's based on a true story so you can't really argue about the plot line.  The acting is stellar by everyone in the cast including Mark Walhberg and Amy Adams.

We all cheer, our hearts leap, our cynicism is momentarily vanquished, and our faith in humanity

This film, in itself, was an underdog. Mark Wahlberg and the powers that be behind this film
had a very tough uphill climb trying to get this film made.
Thank goodness that they were dilligent, because they created a brilliant film.
They found a new approach to an age old format, and the end result is quite impressive.
Both Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale turn in tour-de-force performances!
It amazes me how Christian Bale will loose weight, gain weight, shave his head,
his butt (just kidding!), get muscled and buff, or whatever it takes to completely inhabit his role.
Not since the prime era of Robert DeNiro, have I seen such dedication in an actor!
He wholly deserved his oscar this year for his portrayal of the rough, tough, and grizzled
ex-fighter brother of Wahlberg's character, whose best days are far behind him and he has fallen
into a crack-hazed purgatory. He finds redemption and a new purpose for his life in his close
relationship and involvement in the fledgling boxing career of his younger brother, played with equal
intensity by Mark Wahlberg, who buffs back up ala his ""Marky Mark"" days, but effects a whole other
level of maturity and accomplishment as an actor, which is indicative of his incredible growth
within the entertainment industry into a modern day mogul. He's a respected actor, producer of may hit films and
television series, and was a major force in getting this film made.
The supporting cast was good as well and their are moments of levity scattered through this story

4199885,4,B003UESJHY,"""The Fighter"" was  a project 4 years in the making that finally made it to the screen, in part, due to the persistence of actor and producer Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg found a personal connection in this biographical story of Micky Ward, a working class boxer of Irish descent, the pride of Lowell, Massachusetts, who captured the WBU Light Welterweight title in a fight against Shea Neary in 2000.  Wahlberg and Ward were both from large Irish Catholic families in the Boston area; both had run-ins with the law; their fathers knew each other in prison. They even look alike. This role was tailor-made for Wahlberg, and, predictably, he is convincing.

The film follows Micky Ward's (Mark Wahlberg) personal and professional life from 1993 to 2000, during which time his relationship with older brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), former boxer and Micky's trainer, turned sour and then sweet again. Dicky was a crack addict whose mother Alice (Melissa Leo), the matriarch of her family of 11, spends a lot of time trying to keep Dicky in line and pretending that she's succeeding. Alice was determined that she knew what was best for her 9 children,  and she had her heart set on her boys being great boxers. Dicky, the greater natural talent, did not prove to have the discipline, but Micky would -if he could get out from under his family's sometimes corrosive influence.

This seems like a decent boxing movie in my inexpert opinion, but it is as much about family dynamics. Alice and Dicky are strong characters who sometimes don't know what's good for themselves, much less what's best for Micky. Micky walked a fine line to stay in his family's graces, most of the time, and train in a way that would give him the best chance at success in boxing. As this is a forthright, foul-mouthed, tight-knit family, emotions and agendas tend to be on the surface, often erupting in a disruptive, abrupt manner. Christian Bale deserved his Academy Award for his physically demanding role of Dicky Eklund, a colorful man with a big personality and a very particular way of relating to people.

Incidentally, ""The Fighter"" reminds me of the 1947 film ""Body and Soul"". That project came to fruition under the influence of actor John Garfield, who played the role of a boxing champ from a tough, ethnic, working class background. Garfield wanted to make a movie about the great Jewish boxer, triple division champion Barney Ross. But the Production Code would not permit it due to Ross' drug addiction. So Abraham Polonsky wrote a sanitized, fictional story of a boxer who turns to fighting after the death of his father. Garfield, like Mark Wahlberg, wanted to make and star in a movie about a boxer he admired and with whom he shared a common background.

The DVD (Paramount 2011): There are 2 bonus features. ""The Warrior's Code: Filming The Fighter"" (30 min) interviews director David O. Russell, producers, cast, and the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund about how the film came to be made, Mark Wahlberg's 4 years of physical training, the challenges of portraying real people, shooting the fight scenes, and casting. There is an audio commentary by director David O. Russell in which he introduces us to the minor members of the cast, many of them from Lowell, provides additional information about the real people and what was changed for the film, talks about the acting styles, and offers his recollections of filming.

4199934,4,B003UESJHY,"Known as the ""Pride of Lowell (Massachusetts)"",  Dicky Eklund's (Christian Bale) primary claim to fame is his 1978 boxing match with Sugar Ray Leonard, where Eklund knocked down Leonard, who eventually won the match. In 1996, Eklund, now a crack addict, is in front of the cameras as an HBO film crew is making a documentary about him, the focus he believes (falsely) to be his boxing comeback at close to age 40. For the past ten years, he has also acted as one of the two trainers for his decade younger half brother,Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), who is known primarily as a brawler used by other boxers as a stepping stone to better boxers. Both their careers are managed by their domineering mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) who believes it better to keep it all in the family. Because of his crack addiction, Dicky is unreliable. A move by Dicky and Alice at one of Micky's fights makes Micky come to the realization that his boxing career is being stalled and perhaps even under-minded by the two, who are only looking out for themselves. This stance is fostered by Micky's new girlfriend, college drop-out and now local bartender Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). As Micky tries boxing life without Dicky and Alice - much to their anger - he has to figure out where they fit into his life, especially as they do not get along with Charlene, if at all. These decisions become all the more important as Micky moves up the ranks and is given a shot at the world welterweight championship

While on the surface The Fighter seems to be juyst another boxing movie it is in reality much more. The film focuses on family relationships and on what it means to be a hometown legend. Director Davis O. Russell and producer Wahlberg have created a film that richly desrved the Oscar nominations that it received. The film provides a  look beyond the sport into the lives of the people and their problems and triumphs. The acting by the entire cast makes this film one of the must see films of last year.

The Blu Ray disc comes with a wealth of special features including a commentary track by Russell, two featurettes: one a detailed look at the history of the project and the making of the film; the other a look at the town of Lowell, Massachusetts and its boxing history. A series of deleted scenes some with Russell commentary are also presented.

4199935,4,B003UESJHY,"I am writing this review as a casual boxing movie fan.  Having seen all of the offerings over the past decade or so, this movie was entertaining in comparison only because of Christian Bale's excellent representation of the would-be champ who (tripped) knocked down Sugar Ray.  He nails the quirky and witty remarks & mannerisms of Micky Ward's brother, Dicky.  Wahlberg's performance is essentially a mail-in ... he fits the role well, but seemed uninspired.  This is coming from someone who typically enjoy's Mark Wahlberg's movies, too.  Amy Adams plays the (at first) hard-to-get bar maid and eventual love interest of Micky.
Obviously, the movie is more about the messed up Ward family dynamics and the love/(not quite) hate relationship between two brothers carving their niche in the boxing world.
Overall, 4 stars ... something for both men & women in the movie.",1301184000,,870,5.055944055944056

Mark Wahlberg is great; he's fit, he's tight and he's taugh
but he's not good and that's what makes the film work in my
opinion.  The Director did a really terrific job getting the
feeling right in this movie too, he wasn't too lean when it
came to the ""tough"" fight sequence at the end of the movie
and by that I mean he played it so realistically that I almost
thought I was going to scream if Mark's character doesn't win
that fight.  Mark was brilliant in it and I think, for most who
will eventually see this movie that they will agree with me when
I say that even if Mark's character looses at the end it wouldn't
have made that much difference to the movie because it was a
really good movie throughout and the ending didn't impact the rest
of the movie like they do with lot's of movies.  This movie doesn't
hinge on the ending, it makes a lot of sense to say also that if
the Director had thought of it he wouldn't have let the character loose
like he did through the win which means the better you are at punching the
stronger you seem but the weakest man lost instead of winning!

The plot is hardly original, but, unlike Rocky, it is based on real people and true events.  There are some excellent acting performances here.  Bale's portrayal of the whacked-out, washed-up, punch-drunk, crack addict Dickie Ecklund is classic, and his facial expressions are priceless.  Wahlberg played half brother Mickey Ward low key, even timidly, and probably accurately based on the videos of Ward on the Internet.  More to the point, he looked like a fighter.  He had the proper physique and obviously is a fine athlete as the scenes of him working the bag and jumping rope illustrate.  The choreographed fight scenes were well done although not quite as good as Russell Crowe's mostly ad libbed scenes in Cinderella Man.  Melissa Leo's portrayal of a strong-willed, hands-on mother was so good that I wanted to throttle her character.  But sweet Amy Adams turns garbage mouth here, and I could never quite buy her in the part, lovely to look at as she is.  No problem with her acting.  I just didn't like her in the role.

The blu-ray video was top-notch, and surround effects were excellent via DTS 5.1 during the boxing scenes.  It's only a shame that it wasn't 7.1 TrueHD.

But the language.  Hollywood just has to toss in those F bombs.  Can't have a ""gritty"" drama without it, and the more the merrier.  This fine movie could have reached a far wider audience without the continued use of that accursed word, one the film industry needs to use for . . . what reason?  Realism?  Most likely the Eklund/Ward family uses it freely.  But how realistic is it to portray an aging mother of nine looking mighty fine in a tight mini-skirt?

4199992,5,B003UESJHY,"Mark Wahlberg may have been the main role as Mickey Ward, a Lowell born and raised boxer, with his overbearing mother, Alice Ward, played brilliantly by Melissa Leo (an Oscar winning performance as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Golden Globe Award). Christian Bale plays his older half brother, Dicky Englund, in his Oscar winning performance. He also won the Golden Globe as well.

Both Leo and Bale submerge themselves into their characters almost unrecognizable at times. You just want to smack the sense out of Dicky sometimes but you can't help to like him even if he wasted away on drugs and alcohol in a crackhouse. Leo's Oscar speech may have earned her a spot on the permanent Oscar reel highlights of unforgettable speeches. Her little faux pas came after she saw the people in the crowds. We're lucky that she didn't faint into elderly Kirk Douglas's arms that night. Leo's an actor's actor. She's everywhere in bit parts and finally until two years ago, she earned her first Oscar nomination in a small film, ""Frozen River,"" about a desperate mother in upstate New York. Leo's acting career spans three decades including a role on the series, ""Homicide,"" and I've been watching her ever since grow and evolve as an actress.

The film also casts a police officer O'Keefe who is really a cop and trainer. He's the real deal and he even had to audition for the part. Amy Adams earned an Oscar nomination for her performance as Mickey's girlfriend, Charlene, and she showed another side of her acting range.

The film had some minor issues but it was a great film to watch at times. I really related to the characters who were blue collar and working class. Mark Wahlberg did a superb job but he's a neighborhood boy who lived nearby in Dorchester. This project was very personal to him as well. Jack McGee was fine as the father, George Ward. I don't recognize the seven actresses who played Dicky and Micky's sisters.

I thought it was wonderful that they filmed this movie in Lowell, Massachusetts. Besides the fact that I would have preferred a full-screen version, the widescreen was fine. I enjoyed watching with French subtitles below by my choice. I just wished that they had incorporated more into the special features category to help know more about the history of the brothers, the family, and the actors. The making was about 30 minutes long and okay but I thought the DVD could have even incorporated the Awards especially for Bale and Leo who won many awards and rightfully so for their performances.",1300665600,2,2538,4.7482993197278915

It is a story about two brothers, one of whom is a drug addict and a failed fighter, and the other, who has much more promise but must overcome his family's interference and opposition, especially as regards the woman he falls in love with and later marries.

There is a lot of profanity as well as a lot of bloody fighting which will put off some viewers.  However, the main storyline is compelling and it is based on a real family from Lowell, Massachusetts.

Mark Wahlberg, Melissa Leo, and Christian Bale are great in their roles here, as is Jack McGee.",1300665600,2,590,4.435185185185185

4199995,4,B003UESJHY,This is great movie. The story is really impressive and the acting of Christian Bale and supporting actors is fantastic. Mark Wahlberg is well... Mark Wahlberg. He is not a great actor. But he does his best. And he is adequate for this movie. However Christian Bale pulls off a excellent performance. This a movie not about boxing but a family. In fact there is only a total of about a few minutes of actual fighting in the ring. But I think that why this movie is so successful. If there was more fighting it would seem hokey and boring. The boxing in this movie does seem authentic.,1300579200,,584,4.416666666666667

I had a difficult time keeping Mark Walberg's ""Boogie Nights"" character separated from his performance in this movie!

4200060,4,B003UESJHY,"THE FIGHTER breaks no new ground as a film.  There are many films with the same theme ('Fighting Tommy Riley' is one of the best, but there are many others) despite the fact that this one is based on a true story. There is nothing to really fault in this film: it just doesn't quite live up to the honors and hype afforded it.  Writers Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson have managed to create dialogue and encourage accents specific to the Lowell, Massachusetts setting and their script has a steady flow that makes the film work.  David O. Russell directs a fine cast and makes the most of the secondary stories that take the film out of the ring and into the lives of the Ward family in a credible way.

Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg in a very sensitive, underplayed and under-appreciated performance) is the younger brother of Dicky Ekland - same mother, different fathers - (Christian Bale, gaunt and frighteningly real as a crack addict) who came close to the big time in boxing, a potential hero of Lowell, MA. Dicky is Micky's wholly unreliable trainer and the devotion between the two brothers is palpable.  The 'manager' of Micky's would-be boxing career is the boys' mother Alice (Melissa Leo).  Micky fights losing fight after losing fight until he meets a bartender girl Charlene (Amy Adams) who steers him away form the bad influence of his family - a move that allows Micky to begin to rise in the boxing ranks.  Dicky is imprisoned for multiple charges and gets clean and upon release works with Micky again to lead him to victory.

The Ward family - including father George (Jack McKee) is a mangy bunch- the sisters are made up to appear as tacky as young girls can look and talk.  Melissa Leo is credible as the arrogant yet devoted materfamilias, Christian Bale is stunning in his portrayal of the pathetic Dicky, but Mark Wahlberg is rock solid as the quiet but committed fighter/brother/son. This is probably not a film to see twice but the first viewing is entertaining.  Grady Harp, March 11",1300406400,,2019,4.661971830985915

This movie is a very accurate portrayal of the life and dysfunctional family of the hard-working hard hitting Micky Ward. A great movie that I can relate to both Micky and Dicky Eklund in that I have had a struggle with drugs that landed me institutionalized and got off the drugs and now am participating in MMA and Boxing. Overall I would reccomend this movie to anybody and everybody who is 16 and above as there is a good amout of drug use and some sexual content. But remember this movie is Very true to the life of Micky Ward and his family. 5 Stars! Pick this one up you will feel inspired!",1300320000,3,729,4.251798561151079
4200062,5,B003UESJHY,"Just watched this film last night and I was surprised by how good it was .
The acting was superb by all the cast - Mark Wahlberg took a back seat to the more flamboyant charcater , Dicky Ecklund, played by Christian Bale who deserved the Oscar , but that is not to discount Wahlberg.  The real Mickey Ward was always deferring to his older stepbrother who was his hero as a kid .

Amy Adams is out of "" good girl"" character as a fesity barmaid who fights her man;s family when she feels they are sabotaging him -  this adds to the feeling that Mickey is the submissive brother and Wahlberg nails the character .

Melissa Leo is on spot as the tough mom of nine (1)  who seems to favor the black sheep , Dickey - awesome performance .

The boxing scenes are old school and and reminiscent of the days of classic boxing .
Actually,  this film motivated me to look up and view some of the actual footage between Neary and Ward and Ward  and Gotti , the much more lucrative and well known fights of his career . What a lot of heart Irish Mickey Ward had !
I am glad they made this film so that his efforts and hard luck story could be portrayed .

4200064,4,B003UESJHY,"Based on a true story ""The Fighter"" takes us into the lives of two boxers; Dicky Ward(Oscar winner Christian Bale) who had his chance but didn't succeed fighting solace in crack and his younger brother Mickey (Mark Wahlberg)who Dicky is coaching. Their mom (Oscar winner Melissa Leo) focuses more on Dicky because he didn't make it and emotionally he appears to need the support while Mickey becomes nothing more than a vessel in which they store their hopes and dreams. When Mickey meets Charlene (Amy Adams) he realizes he has a chance to pursue his dream of a title fight but he feels he must break away from Dicky to succeed.

David Russell's film is a marvelous glimpse into the complex relationships in this fractured family and their dreams.

The DVD has looks quite good and the special features which include Russell's commentary track, ""The Warrior's Code"" about shooting the movie, ""Keeping the Faith"" a featurette about Lowell the city where the Ward's lived and deleted scenes.

Based on the true story of two small-town brothers, both boxers, ""The Fighter"" tells of Micky Ward, a welterweight fighter who got in the ring with Alturo Gatti three times. Although his will and heart became the stuff of legend, it's his struggles at home that make him interesting. His older brother, renowned in their town for having knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard, is now a crack addict whose life is being documented by HBO. While he fights his addictive and narcissistic ways, he also brings down his younger brother who has more realistic chances at a world championship.

From Micky's relationship with Charlene, played with surprising toughness by Amy Adams, to his struggles with a controlling mother and interfering sisters, ""The Fighter"" ends up showing a lot of empathy for all involved. It is a story of triumph over one's background, one's personal demons, and co-dependency. It is a true ode to what it means to be a fighter in all areas, and Christian Bale deserved his Best Supporting Actor award, as did Melissa Leo her Best Supporting Actress nod. This ranks with ""Rocky"" as one of the great sports movies, for its heart, its honesty, and its tale of triumph over adversity.",1300233600,,1447,4.830645161290323
4200089,5,B003UESJHY,this has to be the most realistic boxing movie i have ever seen Wahlberg took all the hits just like a real fighter he didn't use any stunt double he tookt he punches and he brought the pyshicality to the movie no other actor could have played Micky while no other actor could had played Dicky like Bale has done in this movie. in the movie Dicky is one of the most colorful characters in any movie i have ever seen he did just a magnificent job at playing Dicky they made this movie about two brothers who get through tough times to take each other and make it to the top. hopefully from what ive read that there will be a sequel about the three Gatti fights which is what Wahlberg wants to do. also in the cast is Amy Adams and she brings to the table something different than what she is used to not playing some one so cheerful but playing a fiesty Charlene who is Micky's girlfriend (and future wife)so great she brings some of the sexiness to the screen because you have to admit Amy Adams is sexy. but overall this movie is a must see i have to say its no just about boxing but that is the main focus in this film but its about family get this movie you will not be disapointed.,1300147200,,1185,4.134199134199134
4200090,5,B003UESJHY,"I wasn't originally interested in this film. I thought, ""Oh, it's another boxing movie."" Even seeing a few clips out of context, I didn't think it was going to hold my attention. But, with the awards it won this year, I figured I'd give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I was hooked every second. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing these real people. After watching the ""making of"" video included in the special features of the BD, you will understand how great of a job they really did. I was amazed particularly at Christian Bale's performance. He deserved his Acadamy award, he became Dicky Eklund: look, mannerisms, voice, everything.

I would almost say Christian Bale was the real star/main character of the movie. The focus seemed to be around him more than Mark Wahlberg, even though it followed Micky Ward's early career. Although, it's really the whole family, and their dynamic that is the main character/focus of the film. Yeah, it's a movie about a fighter, but that's just the setup, it's a prop. The movie is about this family, specifically the brothers and their love.

This isn't just a movie for guys that want to see something about a ""fighter."" This is a movie for men and women, both, with elements that everyone will enjoy.",1300147200,,1246,4.659090909090909
4200091,4,B003UESJHY,"This film was fantastic. I really enjoyed the true-life adaptation of some pretty larger-than-life characters. This is one case where truth is more bizarre than fiction, especially when it comes to Dicky. Christian Bale does a great job as the hilarious crackhead half-brother of boxer Micky Ward. Marky Mark does what Marky Mark does... he plays the understated emotional guy with abs of steel. Amy Adams does white trash quite well, but not nearly to the level of Melissa Leo. Wow! She leads an army of cigarette skinned trashettes though a world of emotional self-centered drama like no other! Between her and Bale's performances - I was almost inspired to grow a mullet and buy a Trans Am with T-Tops.

The story is what you would expect: Rocky 10, but with far superior acting. Yet, I don't care - I really enjoyed it! Great action, heart-felt drama, wacky fun moments, and that never give up spirit that is always hard to deny. This film didn't come with any preloaded Oscar pretense. They kept it real. Amy Adams even kept on her baby fat and showed it off with halter tops. That's Chevy proud!

As far as the 2010 market of true story inspiration films go, The Fighter delivers the emotional punch that the King's Speech didn't for me. Maybe it's because I'm biased. I'm an Amuricun!",1300147200,,1291,4.707964601769912
4200092,5,B003UESJHY,"Up-and-coming boxer Micky Ward is the younger brother of Dicky Eklund, a once-famous fighter now living off the remains of his legend.  Micky wants to shoot for the big time, but with his mother and brother hanging on him, he doesn't have much of a chance.  Enter Charlene, a beautiful bartender who ignites something new in Micky--a will strong enough to break the bonds of family.

Sounds like a cliched storyline?  It is.  It's also true, but that's beside the point.  The fact is, THE FIGHTER is a fantastic film.  It's not your average sports movie (until the last half hour or so); in fact, it's not even a sports movie at all.  It's the story of two brothers.  Mark Wahlberg, as Micky, is a knockout (pun intended); he's had a few flops recently, but Wahlberg dives head-first into the role, taking what could have been a two-dimensional portrayal and making it deep and meaningful.  Christian Bale, as Dicky, deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, even though he's really Wahlberg's costar; this is Bale at his finest, when he has room to breathe and a character to create.  Best Supporting Actress winner Melissa Leo is fantastic as the boys' domineering (but kind-hearted) mother, and as Charlene, Amy Adams (who was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress) shines like she has seldom been able to before.  Jack McGee, as Micky's step-father, is equally engaging.

These performances anchor the film in the here-and-now; this isn't some heart-warming sports flick, it's a story about a family's struggle.  The script is good, though one gets the feeling there's a lot of ad-libbing going on (especially from Wahlberg, Bale, and Leo, who have a great rapport).  Director David O. Russell keeps the film rooted in its Boston surroundings; this is far more of a ""Boston"" film than it is a ""boxing"" film.  THE FIGHTER is one of those rare films to actually earn all the accolades it has garnered.  Is it the greatest film of all time?  No.  Is it the greatest sports movie ever made?  No--because it's not really a ""sports"" movie.  Is it worth your time, and repeated viewings?  Absolutely.  THE FIGHTER is one of those films where you can sit back afterwards and think, ""Yes, this is how movies should be made.""",1300060800,,2228,4.79002624671916

I make sure that I see every performance even when the film doesn't particularly interest me. I felt that way going into the theater to see The Fighter. I had the pleasure of performing in Rocky Balboa, and going into this film I thought, ""how many times are people going to try and remake the Rocky story?"" I grew up in Philadelphia so watching the trailer for this film was uncomfortable, I grew up having the family fights over girlfriends and the neighborhood knowing every thing about you and your life, it's small town just like the feel you get when watching the ads for this film. I have the crazy drug addict who was a brother to me lost in my past too. I just felt this was going to be a two dementional ride to a predictable ending. I was wrong. The performances were riviting, the story though familliar had merit and dimension, and Christian Bale steals every scene that he is in. I beleive Christian said it best himself at the Golden Globes when he said "" you can only give a Loud performance when you have a quiet anchor, thank you Mark Wahlberge, I've played the stoic part and it never gets noticed"" Wahlberge anchors the film and the insanity that unravels around him is beleivable, palpable and exceptional.

4200094,4,B003UESJHY,"Can you follow your dreams without your family?  After a lifetime of being in his brothers shadow Micky (Wahlberg) finally gets the title shot he has been looking for.  The catch is neither his brother (Bale) who has trained him his whole life, or his mother (Melissa Leo) can have anything to do with him.  This is a great movie.  It is a boxing movie, but much like ""Raging Bull"" boxing is only part of the story.  The focus is mostly on the family and how important they are in Micky's life, and how they don't always return the love and need Micky has for them.  Being a true story (also like ""Raging Bull"") makes this movie much more enjoyable and tense, knowing that all of what is happening really went on.  Amy Adams is great in the movie.  This is a total departure from what she usually does (if you don't believe me watch this and then ""Enchanted"").  But I think this movie would not have been nearly as good without Bale.  To me he made this movie.  I felt it was a cross between ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"", almost as good as both of them.  I give it an A-.

Would I watch again? - Yes I would",1300060800,,1104,4.2
4200095,5,B003UESJHY,"If you're a die-hard boxing fan, how do you not love ""Irish"" Micky Ward? Okay, he didn't have that showy personality. He wasn't much for strutting. He wasn't the most skilled or talented pugilist and his defense was practically sieve-like. What he was was an honest fighter, and time and again in the ring, in dishing and doling them lumps, he revealed resolve and character. Nothing like being in the squared circle to distill the essence of a guy. Irish Micky Ward always gave you your money's worth. Micky's one obvious claim to brilliance was his left hook to the body, one of the most murderous go-to weapons I've seen in boxing. See, he liked to set it up with a left hook to the top, quickly followed that up with the left crunch to the body. He knocked down many a fella with that combination. So, here's Micky, an honest, humble, blue-collar slugger from Lowell, Mass. - and totally deserving of getting his story told. THE FIGHTER is terrific stuff. It allows the viewer a peek into this introverted boxer's personal life.

It's great to see Mark Wahlberg's persistence pay off. He fought tooth and nail to get this movie made, and a heap of Oscar nominations proves him right. Mark plays Micky Ward and does him justice, but then again Wahlberg is best when he's playing these working class characters, and you'll root for him one more time. How dedicated was Wahlberg to this role? In the on again, off again history of this film maybe or maybe not getting made, Wahlberg continued training even during his other film commitments. It familiarized him to the hurt business, at least well enough that he looks convincing there in the ring. His left hook to the body looks very similar to just how Micky threw it. Those familiar with Micky Ward's career will note that this film stops short of Micky's classic trilogy with Arturo ""Thunder"" Gatti, which is a shame because I would've loved to have seen Micky and Gatti's friendship explored onscreen. We also miss out on Micky's unbelievable toe-to-toe war with Emanuel Augustus. But it's clear that the film's intent is to chronicle that crucial juncture in Micky's life just before he brawled his way to the big stage. It's about the building blocks that got him there.

Man, it's so surreal for me watching a biopic of a guy I used to follow whenever he was fighting on television. THE FIGHTER tracks Micky Ward's life from 1993 to 2000, but that's taking liberties with them facts. The first fight we see Micky in is his disheartening, mismanaged loss to Mike Mungin, which actually took place in 1988 and not '93. The film climaxes with Micky's thrilling win over Shea Neary. In between those two bouts, we watch several themes playing out: the dynamics of a dysfunctional family, the meaning of brotherhood, the overcoming of doubts, of honest toil and perseverance, and, ultimately, redemption. And, yeah, this family is so dysfunctional they should be the poster children for the definition of the term. We take stock of a drug-addicted half-brother (who happens to be Micky's unreliable trainer) and a domineering mother (who also manages Micky's boxing career). And also a gaggle of sisters, sometimes played for laughs. The film chronicles Micky's romance with Charlene (Amy Adams, always fantastic), the impudent bartender at his local bar. It says something about Wahlberg and Amy Adams' genuine chemistry that I don't feel the film really takes off until Micky decides to take control of his own life, and this is due in no large part to Charlene's support of and impact on him. Micky was this close to quitting boxing forever.

It's a hell of a casting coup, if you haven't glommed on yet. Melissa Leo as Micky's mom is damn memorable, whether you like her or not. But without a doubt, the king scene stealer here is Christian Bale who plays Dickie Eklund, Micky's half-brother and an ex-boxer who had his shot at greatness and whiffed. Bale, looking gaunt and haunted, is mesmerizing in fleshing out the combustible Eklund, and he goes back to THE MACHINIST days, losing scary weight. Bale sinks into the role so completely and is so good I'm actually a little cheesed because his performance at times wrests the spotlight away from my man Wahlberg. But there's no denying that Bale and Wahlberg's interactions are as key - if not more key - than those between Wahlberg and Adams.

THE FIGHTER piles it on, it does. But schmaltz lies at the essence of an underdog feel good story; you just can't escape it. But the story is good enough and grounded enough - and the performances certainly are top drawer enough - to kick sentimentality to the curb. In a neat bit of trivia, the same HBO film crew that shot Micky's original fights were hired to shoot the film's ring action, with the original HBO fight commentary tacked on for added believability. Disappointingly, the fights aren't so memorable, and maybe it's because I've actually seen the live versions of the Alfonso Sanchez and Shea Neary bouts, and then the epic barn-burners Micky had with Augustus and Gatti. But, it turns out, even though this movie is about a fighter, it's not so much about the fights in the ring. My saying that THE FIGHTER could only hope to have the heart of the real Micky Ward isn't me putting this movie down, because it's very much worth watching. It's just that I think so very highly of ""Irish"" Micky Ward. I just never expected to see him in a love scene.

This single DVD also has director David O. Russell's audio commentary and ""The Warrior's Code: Filming THE FIGHTER"" documentary which features interviews with the cast, as well as the real-life Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund interacting with cast and crew (00:29:56 minutes long).",1299888000,,5698,4.751515151515152
4200136,5,B003UESJHY,"I went with my girlfriend to see the film, making an effort to convince her that this boxing themed film called THE FIGHTER was worthy of watching.  I did not expect to be utterly blown away by the amazing performances of the main actors.

The fighting scenes seemed so real, that I found people seated nearby flinching and backing onto the cushions of their seats, as Micky was repeatedly pummelled and punched, blood and sweat flying. Those that were squeamish, hunched closer to their partners, as if in fear of receiving similar blows to their sides..

The audience sat silently watching this awesome story unfold..a most touching, emotionally draining portrayal of the real life  boxing step brothers Micky Ward and a gaunt and aging heroine addict and has-been boxing champ Dicky Eklund.

For those hesitant to watch because'it's just another boxing film', well I must share there is certainly plenty of heart stopping violence during the boxing matches.  However I assure you, this is not a film only about the sport.. Mark Walhberg produced a film that is a wonderful study of the human condition, about a family's deeply entrenched with love and loyalty and over came the odds and how they brought pride and joy to the ordinary folks in small town Lowell who continue to worship their working class heroes, these two brothers.

After watching the film, I went about telling one and all to please go view this film! Word spread to as far as Japan. My friend there tells me The Fighter will premier in Tokyo on March 26th 2011. The international audience will be entertained by the portrayal of the crazy antics of this madcap family.

Christian Bale gave an amazing, incredibly generous un-self conscious performance.. My teenaged daughter whapsapped me from Canada saying 'I couldn't recognize that was Batman!'

Christian, new winner of Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, delivered so realistic a portrayal of loving but aimless older brother Dicky, having delusions of a boxing fight comeback.  Struggling to overcoming his years of heroine addiction, and finally coming clean after some jail time, becomes the story's real hero when he helps his younger brother triumph against odds to win a title match.

The Fighter is pure cinematic magic, that left the audience spellbound, as we watched in baited breath rallying through this colorful family all the way till the final scenes with the heart pounding boxing match that left me drained.  With what hardships this family went through, the glorious and exhilarating fight at the end, made the triumph all the more sweet.

I absolutely fell in love with this story, such that I had to take my dear husband to accompany to watch again. And upon viewing a second time, I saw more details that I missed in my first viewing.

All the actors did a marvelous acting in their respective roles, Melissa Leo absolutely deserved that Oscar..Amy Adams with those gorgeous blue eyes can at once be the beguiling temptress, and those same eyes can instantly change to spew firelight as she tangles with Dicky and Micky's hellcat sisters.

Finally, I wish to say a huge THANK YOU to Christian Bale..You deserved your Oscar, THANK YOU for being in a film that left my husband's attention glued to the cinema screen, and be mesmerized for over two hours, he was so enchanted by the story and your acting, he failed to notice his dear wife crying through the latter half of film. Thank you.. and I predict YOU will have more oscar nominations in the future..and a billion more fans..I will buy the video to add to my collection.",1299283200,2,3571,4.85996705107084

4200138,5,B003UESJHY,"Mark Wahlberg laboured a long time to get this biographical film about ""Irish"" Micky Ward made, with himself in the title role as the boxer.  The result is well worth Wahlberg's investment, and one hopes he finds sufficient reward in that, despite what I imagine was a personal disappointment in not getting an Oscar nomination for the role.  The film did find considerable favour with the Academy despite that, earning seven nominations and an eventual two wins, becoming the first film to win two acting Oscars since fellow boxing drama ""Million Dollar Baby"" in 2004, and the first film to win both supporing acting awards since ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" in 1985.  For people not interested in sports films, ""The Fighter"" is a very atypical example of the genre.  With David O. Russell directing, perhaps it could not help but be atypical; Russell has a reputation as a hard man to work with, but Wahlberg seems the exception to the rule, having made three films with him as of now.  Spoilers follow.

Micky Ward (Wahlberg) is a would-be contender in Lowell, Massachusetts in the early 1990s when we first meet him (the film plays a bit loose with the passage of time; it begins in 1993, and the last event it depicts occurred in 2000, but it doesn't feel like anything near that amount of time has passed).  He has potential, but has never quite managed to go anywhere, and the clock is ticking (if this sounds a lot like ""Rocky"", it is, but then, this really happened).  A big part of Ward's problem is his career management, which is in the hands of his mother Alice (Melissa Leo), and his trainer/half-brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).  Dicky is a former fighter who once lasted a whole fight against Sugar Ray Leonard, a moment of glory he relives obsessively even as he wastes away into drug addiction and general aimlessness.  Then there's his seven sisters, a hilariously-accent chorus to the family drama.  Into this environment steps Charlene (Amy Adams), a bartender who Micky has his eye on.  Charlene and another trainer/police officer, Mickey O'Keefe (played by the real Mickey O'Keefe) demand that Micky break with his family in order to get his career going again.  Complications ensue.

Sports movies are a fairly formulaic genre by now, boxing films especially (boxing is also, incidentally, the Academy's favourite sport, to go by their nomination history).  Director Russell's approach changes things up; this is really more of a family drama than a boxing drama (though there's still plenty of that, for fans).  Micky's career is a family affair, and he has to find a way to reconcile the opposing factions.  In a lot of movies, this would be a fairly cut-and-dry issue, and it initially seems to be here as well, but Alice and Dicky, despite all their problems, do get their due, and Charlene is not pigeonholed as a flawless angel.  This greatly benefits all the characters.

Wahlberg, as previously stated, ultimately missed out on a nomination for his passion project, whereas his costars Leo, Adams, and Bale got nominations (and wins, in two cases).  His is a quiet lead performance (Roger Ebert remarked that Micky may have the least personality of any boxing movie protagonist he'd ever seen, and that wasn't meant as an insult to Wahlberg; he's just not a showy person, in a family otherwise full of vocal individuals), but the film wouldn't work if his performance didn't.  Christian Bale increasingly seems less an actor than a force of nature, once again shedding weight to play a character; Dicky is a skinny bundle of nerves, always moving, and whenever he's in a scene it's hard to take your eyes off him.  The Best Supporting Actor statuette was well-deserved.  Both Amy Adams and Melissa Leo were nominated for their work, with Leo winning for her turn as Alice.  Leo's is an equally showy performance.  Adams impresses in a part very different from her typical image.  A slew of character actors do well in supporting parts.

Highly recommended.",1299110400,2,3990,4.863905325443787

If you truly love movies and when actors transform into character perfectly to make a incredible story and narrative then this is the movie for you. Mark Walberg did a great job, but Christian Bale was simply incredible in this and it is a must ""own"" movie..

 I walked in with high expectations and ""The Fighter"" overdelivered in every way possible having me leave the theatre and pre-ordering this movie the same night..",1298937600,,604,4.583333333333333
4200140,5,B003UESJHY,"This movie has it all. Action, Comedy, Drama and Romance. Mark Wahlberg as Micky Ward was spot on. But to be honest Chistian Bale was the highlight of the movie. He stole the role in every way. Even in some ways overshadowing Mark. One of the best ways to to show how this movie impacted me was writing a poem for my second book.

  Champion Hearts

Two brothers are born both daring to dream,
Both seen training as engines of steam.

One had a desire to get to the top,
To fight with his heart and never to stop.

The other came out with fists that could sing,
With the help of his brother taken under his wing.

Though tough times came to the brothers in life,
They stayed together through trouble and strife.

With hearts and with strength they both came out swinging,
At the sound of the bell as it was dinging.

Now the brothers have fought and have paid their due,
Their pride and their honor will all ring true.

The cheers of their fans will always be heard,
When you say their names in whisper and word.

And when the count is over long after it starts,
The brothers from Lowell both have Champion Hearts.

4200141,4,B003UESJHY,"Christian Bale and Melissa Leo clearly relish their chance to play a manipulative, self-centered pair, with both lending their roles an unusual amount of depth and character. Beneath the dark cloud of bitter dreams and selfishness that surround both, it's easy to tell they see more than just a meal ticket in Micky's unlikely climb up the ranks, though both certainly enjoy the perks of that association. This is really at its best when teetering on the brink of two extremes, with loyalty and family bonds tugging in one direction while self-preservation and a devoted love interest pull in the other, and it feels like a lot of the air goes out of the story when there isn't a big blowoff prior to the finale. The majority of the picture is Micky trying to choose between a rock and a hard place, and in the end he never actually comes to a decision, which I suppose fits with his unsure personality. Interesting filming techniques add a small bonus to the experience, with a drastically different look and feel setting the mood for documentary scenes, family drama and fight nights, respectively. A solid flick, though not one I'd have expected to get a best picture nod.",1298851200,,1175,4.736585365853658
4200142,5,B003UESJHY,"Those of you who haven't seen this really great movie probably don't know that this is less of a film about boxing than it is about a deep, complex, topsy-turvy but ultimately loving relationship between two half-brothers, Dicky Eklund and Micky Ward.  Don't miss it.

Christian Bale's performance of Eklund is other-worldly.  Watching his pitch-perfect portrayal of a Lowell, MA denizen, I found myself constantly thinking ""Remember, this guy is Welsh-born, raised in England.""  Like me, all Massachusetts-born movie watchers scrutinize the accent and the attitude, calling out the offenders like the Laura Linneys and Robin Williams (dreadful in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystic-River/dp/B003ASLJQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystic River</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Will-Hunting/dp/0788814664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Will Hunting</a>&nbsp;respectively).  But of Bale: he's nothing short of amazing.  In physical transformation, talk and character, he is Dicky Eklund.

Amy Adams and Melissa Leo are also great.  The awards season has validated that.  But what of Mark Wahlberg?  This movie was his idea, his passion, his long-running obsession.  Why no awards for him?  Bale said it best at the Golden Globes:

""I've really got to give a shout out to Mark, because he drove this whole movie, and you can only give a loud performance like the one I gave when you have a quiet anchor and a stoic character.  I've played that one many times, and it never gets any notice.""

David O. Russell's direction is fantastic.  The fight scenes are superb.  He also does great things with Ward and Eklund's pack of seven sisters.  Russell bunches them together on couches or spills them out of a car like in a circus.  In the theater I was in, the audience totally got the humor in those scenes.

Other great touches:  the HBO and ESPN commentary heard the movie is the actual commentary from the fights; many of the boxing scenes are punch-by-punch recreations of the original bouts; putting footage of the real Ward and Eklund (2010 vintage) during the credits (which will give you an even deeper appreciation for Bale's portrayal...eerie).",1298764800,4,2254,5.7902735562310035
4200143,5,B003UESJHY,I saw this movie after it received great recognition in award ceremonies. I normally don't like movies that get a lot of awards. Most of them are out right weird for me. Fighter is very different. The movie pulls you in the story right from the start. Christian Bale has done an awesome job in portraying a pot addict. As always Amy Adams is wonderful. I love the family ties in the movie along with the humor. At the end of the movie the real characters are shown.. That's when I truly appreciated how close the reel life was to real life. All the actors have done an awesome job. Perfect movie about family who sticks together through thick and thin. Must watch according to me. Enjoy!,1298764800,,687,4.417322834645669
4200144,5,B003UESJHY,"The Fighter, the rags to riches story of Micky Ward who became a world champion fighter, treads a lot of familiar terrain.  It is a brutal boxing movie (but no more so than other honest depictions of the genre) where ringside spectators get splattered in blood and it is a Boston-area underdog rising out of a very gritty environment.  So you have Rocky, you have Good Will Hunting, you have Mystic River.  But this is non-fiction -- how non-fiction I'll leave for others to parse -- and, here's the big thing, it is an acting tour de force.  Mark Wahlberg is convincing as Micky Ward, but overshadowed by Christian Bale, as his crackhead half-brother, (Bale once again doing terrible things to his body for a movie), by Melissa Leo as his monster Mom, and by Amy Adams as his stand-up girlfriend.  There is also a monstrous Greek chorus of sorts, consisting of Ward's sisters and half sisters, who spend a good deal of their screen time carping and raging about Micky's girlfriend.  The confrontation scene at Adams's house where Walhberg has spent the night is one of the movie's comic -- for it does have its share of comic moments on the march to triumph -- is a true gem.",1298764800,,1176,4.576190476190476
4200145,5,B003UESJHY,"This movie caught me unaware - it wasn't a movie - it was so REAL.  It was a stark docudrama of epic proportions. At times the characters were so real and nauseating, it was hard to watch.  In the end it was about a person rising above his elements of environment and his family to be his best.  The cast was incredible and as soon as you are swept away by their realism - it is an incredible journey. Christian Bale was exquisite and his talent at transforming himself into someone else's persona so incredible that one can forgive almost all the hipe of his ignorant, violent behavior. Mark Walberg is sold short.  His acting was a suitable juxtaposition for Bale. See it.  It will take a few moments to understand that this is more than a movie... it takes you away - to another realistic place and as soon as you adjust - it will take your breath away!",1298678400,,856,4.325
4200166,3,B003UESJHY,"There are two separate and independent ranges of acting: one that spans like a spectrum from comedy to tragedy; the other covers all angles of a type of character. For example, Jack Nicholson has probably covered every imaginable  aspect of an angry person: the comedic, the dramatic, the tragic, etc. Actors like Robert De Niro is marvelous in plots of comedy, drama, tragedy, etc. Great actors thrive in their chosen story telling: character driven or plot driven.

Christian Bale covers angles of a psycho. For him, his character in this  movie is another aspect of such persona. It's disturbing to watch, but the talent is evident.

Amy Adams is thriving in starkly different contexts. She rightly deserves the best supporting actress Oscar this Sunday.

Unfortunately, this movie did not entertain me. Maybe because Mark Wahlberg's character simply did not countervail Bale's--pun unintended. This is not Wahlberg's fault, the story was designed this way to accentuate the inner struggle of the big brother, who saw his little brother in his inner mirror.",1298678400,11,1060,5.175438596491228
4200167,5,B003UESJHY,"OK, you may think, ""another boxing film about a nobody who becomes somebody"", right?  Don't underestimate The Fighter as another boxing film.  It has heart and good acting, but most of all, it is authentic.  This film purposely avoids sentiment and going for easy, weepy moments.  Rocky this is not.  This pet project of producer and star Mark Wahlberg has been years in the making and the payoff here is a gallery of great performances by talented actors who do justice to their real life counterparts.

This true story centers on boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who struggles to be a junior welterweight champion with training by his half-brother and former fighter, Dicky Ekland (an emaciated Christian Bale).  Dicky lives his dashed dreams through Micky and has his own problems with drug addiction and other criminal activities.  The extended family includes a supportive father and a controlling mother, Alice (Melissa Leo).  Micky's life changes when he meets a bartender, Charlene (Amy Adams), who believes in him.  When the opportunity comes to take his career to the next level and work with professional trainers and management in Las Vegas, Micky's relationship with Dicky is jeopardized and causes a mighty rift with his family especially his `manager' Alice who feels betrayed.  To make matters worse, Dicky gets in trouble with the law and must serve prison.  He still lives in the past, clinging to memories of boxing Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978.  Micky is so torn when a seemingly winnable fight switches his intended opponent to one who is much heavier at the last minute, that he contemplates quitting altogether.  Riddled with guilt, he becomes reclusive until Charlene intercedes.  He begins to fight again and amasses a series of wins until he is one step away from a championship if he can overcome a challenger, Sanchez, and Dicky offers tips on how to fight him.  Faced with a chance to really make something of his career, Micky must choose between his new handlers and Dicky who taught him everything he knows about boxing.  It could mean a championship in the end.

The film works on different levels of relationships: Micky and Charlene, Micky and his family, but most of all the film rests on the bond between the two brothers.  There is a good sense of family life and local flavor.  Micky and Dicky grew up local athletes and resident celebrities of sorts in a blue collar town where everybody knows each other.  When Micky and Charlene challenge Alice, there is a tumultuous change of dynamics and a tense battle of wills.  The best scene and also a turning point in the story happens when Dicky confronts Charlene about her own shortcomings, and everything in a way comes full circle as each person must look within to missed opportunities and not achieving their dreams.  It is an honest, pivotal moment that validates Dicky's character who, surprisingly, still knows a thing or two about boxing.  Ironically Micky and Dicky's scenes recall Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger as brothers in On the Waterfront also about a washed up fighter.

The fight scenes are quite convincing and well edited, and when you have a well chiseled actor like Wahlberg (The Departed), a kind of modern day John Garfield, you accept him as a boxer without question.  Bale (The Dark Knight) really inhabits his portrayal of a proverbial loser, and he looks the part having shed substantial weight.  Was this once the boy who enchanted us in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? Come to think of it, Spielberg has another young alumnus in Adams (Catch Me If You Can) who makes the most of her role as a bright, headstrong woman who supports Micky and butts heads with Alice and her daughters literally.  Leo (Frozen River) is quite good as the proud matriarch whose influence and authority is threatened.

The film tells its story as directed by David O. Russell (Three Kings) in workman like manner.  It's almost the kind of film Clint Eastwood makes these days.  The story and relationships are strong enough to easily carry the film without resorting to sentimentality.  Indeed, there is a thrilling moment ringside where a shot almost follows through with Alice and Charlene hugging, but Russell cuts away to another unglamorous shot.  Bravo for not taking the easy way out although there are a couple of scenes could have been extended more.  It's also nice to see the real life brothers in the end credits, and you know that the film has done their lives justice.  The original screenplay and story had a lot of writers involved, and the result is a heck of a remarkable comeback story and a family that would not quit.",1298592000,,4634,4.844980940279543
4200168,4,B003UESJHY,"There have been a lot of boxing movies over the years. Rocky and Raging Bull stand apart as the greatest the genre has to offer. The Fighter is not far behind. In the works for years with a revolving door of directing and acting talent, the only constant was Mark Wahlberg. Seeing this film made has been a passion of Wahlberg's for over five years now, and once you see it, you'll understand why. David O Russell has crafted an intelligent, compassionate, and funny film about the concurrent rise and fall of boxers Micky and Dickie Ward, two Irish brothers living in Lowell, Mass in the early 1990s.

Based on the true story of seemingly washed-up Micky Ward's rise to glory despite the downward spiral of his brother and the mismanagement of his lecherous mother, The Fighter had the potential to be just another syrupy underdog story. Luckily for all involved, a strong screenplay and the wealth of talent involved help to create a film that resonates much deeper than you might initially think. Russell has long proven to be a special director, with Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees, both past collaborations with Wahlberg, serving as high points on his resume. Those two films contain some of Wahlberg's best work, and the trend continues in The Fighter. Wahlberg gives a thoughtful, at times almost understated performance that really holds the film together. He doesn't make the character a clich or stereotype, as easy as that might have been. It's not the flashiest role, and is nearly swallowed up by Christian Bale's performance, but Wahlberg's performance stands as further proof of a solid career, with many highlights yet to come.

Speaking of Bale, a lot has already been said regarding his performance as the troubled crack-addicted former boxer Dickie Ward, but it bears repeating as his presence looms over the film regardless of whether or not he's on screen. Sporting a bald spot and gaunt frame, Bale appears here as a ghostly figure, a constant reminder to Micky of where this hard-luck life can lead. It's a wild, take-no-prisoners performance and the kind of stuff Oscar statues are made of, both hilarious and tragic. In a career chock-full of special performances, Christian Bale's riveting, manic portrayal of Dickie Ward stands alongside Patrick Bateman as the best of his career. The Oscar for Best Supporting Actor is a foregone conclusion. Melissa Leo and Amy Adams also deliver standout performances as Micky's mother and girlfriend, respectively. The two woman serve as opposing forces in Micky's life, and with Dickie serving as the wild card, there is plenty of turmoil surrounding Micky's battered career .

I was surprised at the amount of genuine humor in The Fighter, as a film dealing with family turmoil, crack addiction, and violent beating for small paydays didn't initially seem a candidate for large helpings of comedy. It's never too much, however, and unlike True Grit, the director Russell seems to know when to draw the line and avoid compromising the tone of the film. Oddly enough, the film's only misstep comes in the ring, as the fight scenes lack the speed and intensity of Rocky or the cinematic verve of Raging Bull. Russell opted to shoot them from a broadcast perspective, and the resulting effect, complete with commentary, HBO graphics, and a marked change in cinematography, feels disjointed and underdeveloped. Still, Wahlberg is in fantastic shape and is more than convincing as a welterweight fighter. The punches pack a wallop, but suffer in comparison to the stomach punch of family drama that permeates Micky's climb to the top. Despite the tragedy of Dickie Ward and the awfulness of his = mother and sisters, The Fighter is a feel-good movie. We all know how it will end; it is based on a true story, after all. What matters is the fight to get there and, thanks to a screenplay which rises above clich and a host of excellent performances, The Fighter is still standing tall at the final bell. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",1298505600,,3985,4.8920118343195265
4200169,4,B003UESJHY,"One of the best boxing movies I've ever seen is Mark Wahlberg's The Fighter (2010). It's right up there with Cinderella Man (2005), Rocky (1976), Rocky II (1979), and Rocky IV (1985). It may even be the best boxing movie I've ever seen...but only time will tell for sure. Right now, I consider Cinderella Man my favorite. I haven't seen Raging Bull (1980) yet, and while I liked Million Dollar Baby (2004), it just didn't pack the same emotional punch for me as a guy. I give The Fighter 3.5 stars out of 5. Which may seem low to some, but I'm comparing it to every other great movie of all time, not just boxing or sports movies. This is a film that definitely deserves consideration for my Top 200 Movies of all time. So it's rating may go up subsequent viewings.

What stands out about The Fighter compared to Cinderella Man and the Rocky films is the photography of the actual boxing scenes. The Fighter used the actual 1980s camera crews from HBO who filmed some of the ""Irish"" Micky Ward fights that this film is about. They even used the same cameras from that time period to give the same look and feel to some of the footage of the fights, like you're watching them live almost. It's the combination of that incredible cinematography, the awesome sound effects and music, and the stellar ""acting"" by Mark Wahlberg and his opponents that make the fights feel so real. I was literally squirming around in my theater seat during every boxing match in the film. It was just such a visceral presentation that made me feel right there in the ring, ducking punches and feeling battered & bruised.

Part of what really lends a realism and emotional depth to the boxing in this film,  is that Wahlberg actually trained as a boxer for 5 years leading up to his role on the film. It took that many years and more to get the film made, and while he was fighting to get this movie produced, he was training so that he didn't just look like he was acting. And it handsomely paid off! The best parts of The Fighter are in the ring. But there's an awful lot to love outside of the ring as well. Christian Bale plays Dicky Eklund, half brother of Micky, a former boxer himself, and Micky's trainer. Dicky is most well known for his fight with Sugar Ray Leonard. But Dicky has fallen into a drug habit that keeps him from being effective as a brother, a boxer, or a trainer. He even winds up in jail for a period of time, where he is finally forced to get clean. That forces Micky to get a new trainer, but Dicky comes back as soon as he gets released. The brotherly bonds prevail after all! Bale plays Dicky very well. I can't say that I really liked the Dicky character, although he redeems himself towards the end of the film. But Bale's performance is definitely worthy of his recent Best Supporting Actor nomination. He inhabits the role like no one else could, like it or not.

The real out-of-the-ring punches come in The Fighter from two incredible women: Amy Adams as Micky's girlfriend and Melissa Leo as his mother. Both give unbelievable performances that are probably their best to date. They literally fight with their hands and their words. They've both received Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress in honor of these roles, so they will continue their onscreen ""fighting"" offscreen at the Academy Awards later this month. I'm personally cheering for Leo to win since I think her performance just edges out Adams, and her body of work for many years has earned her the recognition in my opinion. In addition to Adams and Leo are a gaggle of Micky's sisters, some of whom are actually played by Micky Ward's real sisters. They definitely add some spice to the mix, and help create some incredibly tense family scenes. Actor Jack McGee really shines as well as Melissa Leo's boyfriend, and Micky's stepfather. The beating he takes both emotionally and physically from Melissa Leo's character is one of the most memorable ""fight"" scenes I've seen in awhile! It had me laughing and feeling sorry for him at the same time!

Director David O. Russell, mostly known for Three Kings (1999), really had his work cut out for him here. And he rose to the occasion beautifully! The Fighter is not nearly as flashy of a film as Three Kings, but it's got this solid, gritty, cinematic realism and incredible emotional depth to the storytelling that makes it engaging. Whereas Three Kings was more unique in terms of filmmaking style, The Fighter is more classic in its style. But it's very effective. I found the pacing at some points to be a little slow and boring, but overall, the film flowed pretty smoothly. I think Russell did the best that he could with the story he was telling.

The cinematography, outside of the ring fights, is adequate. This is probably the area I was most disappointed. The film felt a little too gritty, grainy, and gray for my taste. Granted, it's also the 1980's and the feel of the area where the story takes place, so I think the filmmakers chose to lend it that very realistic look and feel. Still, I like to say great camera work, and that just didn't happen in this film for me. I'd be willing to say that it could have just been the theatrical presentation itself. I've noticed some of the theaters have some crappy projectors sometimes. I'll be curious to see if I feel the same way when I watch the film again on Blu-ray at home.

The production design on the film is perfectly suited to the story, but like the cinematography, it didn't really stand out for me on a purely artistic level. While the music score by Michael Brook was a bit weak and could've been stronger, the rock songs used throughout the film really worked well, especially the song ""How You Like Me Now"" by The Heavy. That song is definitely now the song I hear when I think of The Fighter. It's permanently etched into my brain with this film, and it really works in the movie to build-up energy for a fight.

There's a lot to like with The Fighter. I didn't really have any expectations going into the theater for this film. In fact, I was expecting to be less satisfying based on some critics' reviews. But I'm very glad I saw this film in the theater, because that big screen presentation with the loud sound system really helped this film knock me out. If I were you, I'd catch in the theater if you can, but I'm sure it will play well at home as well.",1297209600,,6369,4.508225108225108
4200170,5,B003UESJHY,"The best boxing movies aren't just about boxing and that's what makes David O. Russell's The Fighter such an impressive achievement. With an impressive cast of actors lead by Mark Wahlberg (also a producer) and Darren Aronofsky as the executive producer, The Fighter takes a story that's been told before but presents a fresh, entertaining take on it. The title card `Based on a True Story' and the idea of a ""boxing movie"" has become a clich but The Fighter isn't just a feel-good movie about a down-on-his-luck boxer making a comeback and that's where it really succeeds.

The film begins in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1993 where Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), a former professional boxer who knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard fourteen years ago, is being followed by an HBO documentary crew who, he claims, is documenting his comeback. Dicky is known as the Pride of Lowell, but his career has fallen by the wayside due to crack addiction. Crack hasn't taken Dicky's drive, but it's ravaged his body and withered his potential. His younger brother Micky Ward (Wahlberg) is a 30-year-old welterweight boxer trying to prove his worth in the boxing world, but going nowhere with his overbearing mother Alice (Melissa Leo) managing him and Dicky training him. Coming from a large family that includes seven (loud-mouthed) sisters and his father George Ward (Jack McGee), Micky puts family above all matters but is becoming disillusioned with the idea of trying to make it as a boxer with Alice as his manager and the increasingly unreliable Dicky as his trainer. George, the frequently berated, disrespected, and unappreciated husband, is the only level-headed member of the brood. Frustrated by how his commitment to family has affected his career, Micky takes a hiatus from boxing and meets a bartender named Charlene (Amy Adams), whose assertiveness drives Micky to realize his potential.

Movies of this type come out every year, but this film benefits from more depth and more classic themes than the usual predictable boxing fare. Set to a great classic rock soundtrack, the film's main theme is the importance of family and is about family ties and personal relationships while maintaining the boxing film motif with themes of overcoming personal boundaries and not giving up on your dreams. It's an inspiring film, exciting even when you're aware of the eventual outcome, with well-handled, entertaining boxing scenes. It's quite humorous too, but this humor doesn't come from the script but from the characters and how they may remind us of people from our own lives. For this reason and the existence of over 100 years of cinema before it, some characters may seem familiar to you. Alice is a selfish woman, more concerned with her children doing things for her than doing things for themselves. She puts on a show for the documentary crew and likes the attention she gets because of her two boys, whether it's as a result of their successes or failures. Along with everyone else Alice is aware of Dicky's drug habit but refuses to acknowledge it, even when she has to go to the crack house to retrieve him, prompting him to jump out of a second story window out of fear. Micky has a daughter named Kasie whom he sees every other weekend, but is not on good terms with the mother. This relationship with both the daughter and her mother is underdeveloped, but we get the idea from having seen it before. I mention these familiar areas to emphasize how great the performances are in this film. The Fighter is a very good movie, but the performances here are so nuanced and so layered they lift it to greatness.

Wahlberg plays Micky as tough, but sensitive; not too bright, but sensible, trying to do what's best for himself but not wanting to turn his back on his family. He hits all the right notes as Micky and, in a different movie he would probably be the center of attention. Wahlberg is completely overshadowed by the supporting characters and the film's biggest flaw could be that the main character is not as interesting as the characters around him. Leo is probably going to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and it would be a richly deserved win, as she's a remarkable actress that impresses me more every time I see her. She disappears into her characters to such an extent that I sometimes don't realize it's her until the film ends. Alice is an unlikable character familiar to most moviegoers, but Leo doesn't make Alice into a caricature by effectively tapping into what drives this woman and making her feel like a real person. The Melissa Leo in The Fighter is indistinguishable from the Melissa Leo in another 2010 film called Welcome to the Rileys which is a testament to what a remarkable actress she is. In a scene late in the film, she changed my entire opinion about her character by simply looking at Wahlberg. I was floored. Amy Adams is a very talented actress that plays Charlene with fiery conviction, but she has no chance for Oscar glory next to a performance of Leo's magnitude. Rarely mentioned is the performance by Jack McGee as George, but he's the hidden gem of the performances. As the submissive husband who sometimes suffers physical abuse at the hands of Alice, McGee brings great humor and humanity to the role. But the real star of the show is Christian Bale:

Dicky Eklund was once a star to people, and he still is, but for a different reason which he doesn't seem to consciously acknowledge. He's nice and likable, with good intentions but is a flawed character. Dicky is a role with Oscar bait written all over it, but Bale doesn't seem to tackle it the way many actors would. Ironic, since Bale is going to win the Academy Award for this role. With significant success in Hollywood blockbusters, people tend to forget what a great actor he is but this performance will remind them. This is more than just an actor losing a bunch of weight, and while Bale's physical transformation is remarkable (particularly when he's standing next to Wahlberg, looking so much smaller in comparison) he brings so much more to the character. The nuance he brings to Dicky; the way he captures the mannerisms, the voice, the personality, and the physicality is incredible. He shares a convincing brotherly charisma with Wahlberg and brings emotional potency to the film too, such as the scene where Dicky is arrested. A role like this would lead some to overact, but Bale is in complete control of the performance. There's no lesser way to say it; Bale is a revelation, further demonstrating he's an actor capable of anything. Look at the big scene between Bale and Adams in the last few minutes of the film. Think of how many times you've seen this scene played out in movies before. Now watch how Bale plays this scene and how it compares to the way other actors would have played it. It's a flashy performance, but not one without subtlety. It's a perfect collision of style and substance.

As I said, the best boxing movies aren't just about boxing and the movie is aware of that going in and manages to come out as a terrific entry in this tired genre. It's not profound or unpredictable, but it's one of the year's best films due to brilliant performances and smart execution. You may think I'm over-rating the film when I admit that it hardly differs from a familiar formula, but The Fighter is so much better than its familiar storyline implies. Even the most unique films of 2010 didn't have performances as great as these. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that nor can you deny that this is one well-made, entertaining movie.

4200171,4,B003UESJHY,"A trio of remarkable performances propels this frenetic, punch-drunk take on a dysfunctional family saga, and the compelling 2010 drama marks a return to form for iconoclastic director David O. Russell (his last film was the failed existential comedy, 2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Heart-Huckabees/dp/B0006TPE4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Heart Huckabees</a>). Written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson, the film tells the fact-based story of boxing half-brothers ""Irish"" Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund, eking out a blue-collar existence in Lowell, Massachusetts. Dicky once went the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard back in 1978, but it's the mid-1980's now, and he's vainly trying to recapture that moment of notoriety. Micky, on the other hand, remains firmly in Dicky's shadow, as he tries to follow in his footsteps and become a professional fighter. Most of the plot focuses on the demons that haunt and control them. Dicky's are internal as he has deteriorated into a scarifying crack addict and criminal, while Micky's struggles come from the stranglehold his family has on his life and career. Dicky is Micky's trainer, and their hell-bent, bottle-blonde mother Alice is his manager, neither of whom are willing to admit that they aren't savvy enough to get Micky a decent shot at the welterweight title.

Micky's one personal salvation comes from his no-nonsense girlfriend Charlene, a tough-talking bartender who goes toe to toe with Alice and her seven grown, detestable daughters. Naturally, this sets the stage for a battle over Micky's soul. The irony of the film is that Micky has to be a dramatically inert figure since he is really a victim of his family's volatility. Consequently, Mark Wahlberg leverages his likeable average-guy demeanor to play him in an economic manner that manages to evoke sympathy for his stoic, often passive character. This gives room for Christian Bale (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>) to steal his scenes handily with blazing intensity as Dicky. He dropped thirty pounds to shape his wiry, bug-eyed performance, and it sears in the memory. The gifted Melissa Leo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen-River/dp/B001KEHAG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen River</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conviction/dp/B004EQAVA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conviction</a>) is equally fearless as the manipulative Alice, a vainglorious Lady Macbeth figure who is willing to steer her son toward failure if it means he won't abandon her. As Charlene, Amy Adams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted/dp/B0011U52EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted</a>) surprises the most with a flurry of F-bombs that serve to protect her clear-eyed commitment to Micky, even though her character has been developed mostly on one angry note. All three deserve recognition during the awards season.

If the movie has one persistent flaw, it's that most of the rest of the characters are reduced to caricatures, especially Alice's big-haired daughters who act like a dispiriting Greek chorus to the proceedings (and strangely no bratty children surrounding them). The comic moments are welcome, but sometimes the approach feels like it cheapens the story. Russell's idiosyncratic filmmaking style is evident throughout with the camera constantly shifting to match the nervous energy of the narrative. In order to stick to the facts, he and the screenwriters shift the story in the home stretch to Micky's journey toward the title and more or less, abandon the head-butting family dynamics driving most of the story. Although the film ties up the fate of the characters neatly, it begins to feel more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B0006GAO5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Bull/dp/B004AOECUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Bull</a>&nbsp;toward the end, and a certain hollowness permeates the film's resolution, even though cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema does an excellent job staging the fights leading to the inevitable ending.

4200217,4,B003UESJHY,"Overview:

This film is what I would consider to be the 'Real Rocky' story. It is gritty, it is seedy, and it is real. This film is based on the life of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and his older half-brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).

They are two brothers, who are chasing a dream, to be recognized as a boxing champion. Dicky's had his shot and once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard, as his dream fades, he can still talk the talk, but as reality hits him he turns to the crack house. His habit drives him into criminal activity and eventually jail.

While Dicky is in jail, Micky makes some serious strides, partially being motivated by his future wife, Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams) in terms of winning his fights. At the point where he has a shot at a title fight, Dicky is released from prison and makes a serious commitment to stay clean and to assist in training his brother.

This is a film about having a dream, and struggling, and making sacrifices to reach the goal and the destiny of your life. To attain the vision of your life.

The Brothers:

Micky, being the younger grew up in the shadows of Dicky. He looks up to him, but realizes too late that his brother was only selling him smoke and mirrors, as his real interest is crack (that is until he is dried out in jail).

Dicky always enjoys being the hero and the center of attention. It's this crave for attention that caused him to be duped into making a HBO documentary on Crack in America. Bale does an exception job acting as a crack head, he looks quite drawn and just a bit punch drunk.

In the end, they are able to set aside their differences, come together to work towards a common goal.

The Title Fight:

The fight of his career was the Welterweight Championship bout with Shea Neary, in London. This fight takes place in 2000. This fight was quite sensational; you should see it for yourself.... so I will not put in a spoiler here.

The Conclusion:

This film motivates and it shows the strength and resolve of the human spirit. The unwavering determination of Micky is truly to be admired and emulated.",1294963200,,2099,4.465968586387435
4200218,3,B003UESJHY,"That's exactly how I found this movie: anti-climatic.  To me, THE FIGHTER was NOT about Mickey Ward, the boxer, but about Mickey Ward, the son and brother.  Before I saw the first frame of this movie, I knew that Mickey Ward, the boxer, would win a big title otherwise why bother make a movie about him.  But I was not sure what would happen to Mickey Ward, the son and brother.  As I was watching the movie, it became clear to me that this movie was about Mickey Ward cutting the umbilical cord and standing up to both his mother and brother.  The first chance he gets to do this is when he and Charlene stops by his family's house to inform them that he will be training in Vegas with other people besides them.  Does he tell them?  No.  Charlene is the one who has to pretty much spill the beans.  The second chance is when he has to tell his mother that she is not his manager anymore.  Does he tell her?  No.  She initially finds out about it from her husband, George, who gets hit by a frying pan.  The third chance is when he has to decide if he is going to keep his promise and retain his new manager and trainer or go back to his mother and brother.  Does he keep his word?  No.  He goes back to his mommy and brother.  But he gets a second chance.  He can try to get everyone to work together.  But does he even try to do this?  No.  Instead of him going to Charlene's apt. to try to coax her to work with his brother--it was Dickey who did it.  Mickey Ward has got to be one of the most static characters on film in recent memory.  He never did develop a spine.  This is precisely why I found THE FIGHTER to be anti-climatic.  David O. Russell made one HUGE mistake in this movie.  Instead of having Dickey trying to coax Charlene back on Mickey's team--it should've been Mickey who did this.  This is why this movie failed to me.  6/10.",1294531200,9,1848,4.129577464788732
4200219,5,B003UESJHY,"It's about time that I got around to seeing The Fighter. With the rush of holiday releases it kept getting pushed back on my schedule to make way for Black Swan and True Grit. Plain and simple, this is one of the best films of 2010.

I'm a boxing fan, so I remember watching Micky Ward fight live. His three fights with Arturo Gatti being one of the best trilogies of all time. Sadly, those fights are not mentioned until the end credits, but this film is more about the strained relationship between two brothers and one crazy family (including seven rough looking sisters who don`t mind throwing punches with anyone they don`t like...pretty much everyone). The boxing scenes were not as big of a part as I thought they would be, but they are filmed extremely well and leave a realistic impression.

The acting alone is worth the price of admission. Okay, Mark Wahlberg may be the weakest link of the bunch in the lead role as Micky Ward, but he still turns in one of his strongest performances yet, for him at least. His quiet demeanor does the trick. Melissa Leo and Amy Adams both deserve to be nominated for Oscars, especially Leo as the tough and controlling mother/manager of Ward. As I'm sure you've heard, Christian Bale finally sinks himself into a role that reminds everyone watching why he is called one of the best actors of his generation. He fully becomes Micky Ward's drug addicted brother, Dicky, in such a way you'll think he must have really been on crack himself during filming. He's not quite at the sickly level of thin he was in The Machinist, but he isn't in any kind of shape to be fighting the scum of Gotham. Every scene he is in pops with unpredictability. I think the supporting actor Oscar will be his without a doubt.

The main reason why The Fighter works is that it doesn't gloss over anything. The trailer may make this seem like another inspirational Rocky type movie, but this thing is raw, gritty and anything but rosy. By the end though, it somehow manages to make you feel good. Flaws and all, you'll begin to care about this wacky group of people.

In my mind, The Fighter is on the same level as Rocky and Raging Bull. All three are great windows into the world of boxing, but it's the characters that keep us coming back for round 2 and beyond.",1294444800,,2286,4.487980769230769
4200220,3,B003UESJHY,"There is a very high rating of this film on internet movie database. I actually went to the theater to watch it and I don't think it deserves anything more than a 6/10. Wahlberg is OK, Amy Adams' character was quite despicable for some reason (maybe some sort of intelligent formula) and Christian Bale was the saving grace of the film.

Very ordinarily narrated and the direction left me gasping out of despair at certain times, maybe it's the bad luck Wahlberg brings to any film featuring him.

There were maybe 2 good scenes in the whole film.

I could have lived my life without watching this film but I can't say that about some of the better films this year (Black Swan, T.S.N, Buried and The Town)

4200222,4,B003UESJHY,"THE FIGHTER may be based on a true story, but that doesn't mean that much of the skeleton of its plot doesn't feel like a rehash of Hollywood clichs.  Struggling blue-collar guy from a dysfunctional family gains a shot, late in life, at boxing glory.  Various obstacles get in his way, but with the love of a good woman and some unconventional training & methods...he gets his shot at the title.  It's the kind of plot that would not normally get my blood pumping in anticipation.

But of course, THE FIGHTHER is brought to us by the singular director David O. Russell (the brilliant and very sadly overlooked THREE KINGS), and features some amazing performers.  It's a true story.  And it's a two-way shot-at-redemption story.

Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a boxer from Lowell, MA who has been under the management of his mother (Melissa Leo) and the tutelage of his half-brother Dickey (Christian Bale).  He's not had much luck, mostly serving as a punching bag and stepping-stone for other boxers.  Dickey is himself a boxer, one who once battled Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him down during a fight.  But Dickey is getting on in years AND he has a pretty serious problem with crack cocaine.  His drug usage makes him late for training, late for flights and just generally a volatile and scary person to be around.  In the early going of the film, an HBO crew follows Dickey and his family around...Dickey crows about how the film crew is documenting his comeback.  And we have to wonder how anyone could seriously think this shrunken, mumbling, twitching man could ever mount a comeback.

Mickey seems doomed to a 3rd class boxer forever...and already sees a life of working on a roadcrew or a roofing company as the only thing he has to look forward to.  He comes from a FRIGHTENING family.  His mother lives in a middle-class house with her SEVEN daughters.  All these women are imposing and just a little crazy.  The daughters cling to their mother like harpies-in-training...and Mom is a force of nature.  She clearly believes that she has business savvy and that she has the best interests of her sons in mind.  But she is really a blue-collar monster.  Her domineering presence has stopped the men in her life, including her current husband, from blossoming.

But Mickey meets a bar girl, who is just as rough and blue-collar as anyone else (Amy Adams)...but this is the girl who will pry him away from his family.  She's tough and fearless.  There's a great scene where she is first introduced to all the women...and the scrutiny, name-calling and obvious hatred that fills the overcrowded living room would surely crush a lesser woman.  But Adams stands her ground, and finally Mickey can talk back too...just a little.  Later, circumstance gives Mickey the chance to take on a new manager and some new training, and his career begins to head in a new direction.

I don't want to say any more.  The journey these characters take is gripping stuff, and I'd hate to spoil anymore.  And the journey is greatly aided by some terrific acting.  Melissa Leo (so fantastic a couple of years ago in FROZEN RIVER, and prior to that in 21 GRAMS) is a powerhouse.  Here's an actress who has no ego and no qualms about making herself physically and emotionally ugly.  Just knowing she was in the film was enough to grab my interest...she's that good.  Amy Adams plays against type as a character earthier than we are accustomed to from her...and she's amusing and fun.  Wahlberg gives another restrained but effective performance.  He has a style that is becoming very familiar now...the nice guy who is perhaps slow to speak and slower to anger...but when it comes out, watch out.  But we root for him throughout, and it is his emotional journey we follow gladly.  Christian Bale, however, is more problematic.  He absolutely looks the part...once again, he's dropped weight and made himself look his part.  But his manic energy, which is appropriate for his drug-addled character, seems showy and flashy.  The other characters feel like people we might meet and recognize...Bale is acting on another, more ""actorish"" level, and he feels removed from everyone else.  For him, this appears to be ""The Christian Bale Show.""  I admit, I'm not a fan...I really dislike him as Batman/Bruce Wayne...but every time I think I'm being too hard on the guy, he reaffirms my inclination to call him vastly overrated.  (That being said, he WAS great in AMERICAN PSYCHO.)

THE FIGHTER isn't quite the movie of the year.  But it's endlessly interesting, directed in an effective and restrained manner, and for the most part, impeccably acted.  The locales feel authentic.  The boxing scenes are excellent and easy to follow.  And the fact that it's true certainly adds something.  I recommend it enthusiastically.",1293840000,,4801,4.824754901960785

4200224,4,B003UESJHY,"I enjoyed watching the Fighter starring Mark Wahlberg.  The actors inhabit the characters they play on screen.  I forgot I was watching two actors, and I was immediately drawn into the llives of brothers  Mikey and Dicky Eklund.  Christian Bale co stars as Dicky. He is the older brother and trainer of boxer Mikey Ward.  Bale's performance as a crack cocaine addict is convincing.  He is a person who is trying to clean up his life and train his brother in boxing at the same time.  One of the most powerful scenes in the movie involves Dicky listening to one of his brother's fights on the telephone.  The boxing scenes are good.  Even though I knew the outcome of the fights being a boxing fan, it was still fun to see Mark Wahlberg throw punches.  Boxing is not just a physical sport.  It is also a mental sport that involves mental will power  and strategy.  The scenes between Wahlberg and Bale convey this very well.  Amy Adams is also very good as Charlene.  She plays Micky's love interest.  I like how their relationship develops in the movie.  Charlene is not easily accepted by the members of Dicky's family.  His family includes his mother Alice.  She is played well by Melissa Leo.  She is a woman who is trying to support her two sons at different stages  Dicky also has many sisters in the film.  They don't seem to do anything but sit on the couch and smoke cigarettes.  The strength of the film are the performances by Wahlberg, Bale  Adams and Melissa Leo, so these minor characters are okay.

This film features the song ""Here We Go Again"" by Whitesnake.  This is a great song  but it is not included on the soundtrack.  This is a minor disappointment.  The instrumental music played at the end of the movie is upbeat, but that is about all I can say about the music.  The Fighter is an entertaining  film with excellent acting performances. It lacks memorable music that would make this film perfect.",1293753600,,1921,4.545454545454546
4200225,5,B003UESJHY,"""The Fighter"" is a very engrossing movie, one of the best films of the year, but don't be fooled by some of the reviews; it is still part of the very durable boxing film genre with lots of scenes of fights. The movie is based on a real story of the fighter, Micky Ward, whose legendary bouts with Arturo Gatti are not reenacted in the movie.
Mark Wahlberg is superb as the fighter Micky Ward, and in the unsympathetic role of his brother, Christian Bale does a superlative job. Dicky was Micky's older brother, and Micky always hero-worshipped him, a boxer whose claim to fame was that he had knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard in a fight.
He is supposed to be Mick's trainer, and the hard-nosed, termagant mother is supposedly his manager. Dicky is so addicted to and in the service of a bad crack problem that he is a lousy trainer.
It takes place in gritty Lowell, Mass, one of those New England cities that never saw recent economic boom periods, but lived and still live in a state of decline and decay. Many of the shots show the mill town as it was and is.
Melissa Leo is Alice, the mother of a huge brood; she's tough, brassy, bossy and favors Dicky. It is a role that will deservedly be in contention for an Academy Award.
 Certain elements in the story add comedy. Alice's seven grown-up, horrible daughters are really cartoons or caricatures, and some of the older characters are stereotypical. A few clichs of boxing cinema poke out at you. There are tear-jerking moments as well.
 But despite its shortcomings, the film is a testament to the durability of family relationships, mother and son, and especially brother and brother.
 When Micky gets a strong-willed girlfriend, Charlene, (Amy Adams) who starts looking out for his interests, the family goes on high alert, but Charlene can give back as much as she gets. There's even a physical female brawl in one ""comic"" scene. Jack McGree is excellent as Alice's long-suffering husband.
 The dynamics of that family are going to get under your skin, and you're going to be entranced by the seven cronettes.
 Micky has to break from his brother when Dicky goes to prison, but the pull of the family is very strong in him. Charlene can't believe that such a bludgeoning family could ever help him, but Micky is a kid brother who has learned how to survive and thrive in such a brood.
 It's a motion picture that will command your attention beyond the ring scenes, good as they are, but by the way a family tugs, manipulates, loves, and persists perhaps because it is a force of nature.",1293148800,,2542,4.5881057268722465
