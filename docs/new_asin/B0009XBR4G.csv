8069363,5,B0009XBR4G,"I bought this DVD for my grandchildren because I wanted the story of the Little Red Hen.  This story especially teaches such good ethics to children in an entertaining way that they will never forget.  It teaches them the importance of working hard to get rewards, and cooperating with others.  It teaches them these virtues in a very pleasing and memorable way.  I remember this story from my childhood and have never forgotten its simple and important message.  I showed this movie to my children when they were growing up and they were so delighted to see it again.  They still remember its important message and were so happy to review this delightful movie.  The other two are cute little children's movies also.  The one movie I would really like to find that is as important a classic as this one however is ""The Grasshopper and the Ant"".  It is another important fable that teaches important values.",1179532800,,907,4.726114649681529
