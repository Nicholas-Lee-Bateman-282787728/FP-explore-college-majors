4306835,3,B004AAXDM8,"A curious Israelisation of Elmore Leonards 52 Pick-Up made only two years before the same producers made a more faithful and compelling adaptation with John Frankenheimer, The Ambassador is the kind of okay but resolutely undemanding political thriller that was starting to look more at home on the small screen than the big by 1984. Even the star cast - Robert Mitchum, Rock Hudson, Ellen Burstyn, Donald Pleasance, Fabio Testi - had started grazing on TV by then and was about a decade too late to draw much of a paying crowd at the movie theaters. After a disappointing US release, the Cannon group didn't even bother to release it in most of the foreign cinemas they owned despite planning it as a big prestige picture.

Leonard's original plot was solid enough not to need any additional spins: a businessman is blackmailed over his affair, but rather than pay up he comes clean with his wife. None too pleased, the blackmailers murder his mistress and set him up for the crime, forcing him to set them against each other (shades of Leonard's 50s Western The Tall T) before they can drop him in it. In this version the hero is now the US Ambassador to Israel, it's his wife who's having the affair and the stakes are raised by the blackmail scheme coinciding with his attempts to get the Israelis and the PLO around the negotiating table. Yet turning a private scandal into a possible international incident actually lowers the tension - even though he tries to handle it quietly himself, Mitchum's character simply has too much power, too much access to money and too many resources to call on, which makes him less self-reliant and devious than Roy Scheider in 52 Pick-Up. It doesn't help that most of the heavy lifting is done by Hudson, surprisingly not looking too unhealthy in his final film, or that the villains are a poorly defined bunch who are never manipulated, merely caught.

While J. Lee Thompson's film is not as appropriately seedy as Frankenheimer's later version, the old lech does manage to persuade Burstyn to let her puppies out of their kennel as the ambassador's wife with a taste for getting drunk at receptions and sleeping with Arab antique dealers-cum-PLO leaders, and there are enough explosions, helicopter shootouts and unconvincingly bloody massacres for the Go-Go boys to get a good exploitation movie trailer out of it despite its high political ideals (""He's through negotiating!""). But the cast are surprisingly good and generally avoid coasting even if they're not on top form, it's solidly made and, like co-producer Menachem Golan's earlier Operation Thunderbolt, more even-handed with the Arab characters than you'd expect even if the politics never stray beyond simplistic well-meaning ""give peace a chance"" platitudes. Unexceptional but watchable.

The German DVD and region-free Blu-ray offers a cleaned up widescreen transfer with US trailer and stills gallery as extras.",1403136000,4,2920,5.004115226337449
4306836,4,B004AAXDM8,I don't like the nude seans. It is very distasteful. the rest of the movie was very good .good story Loved Rock Hudsons performance.,1370390400,2,132,4.541666666666667
4306837,5,B004AAXDM8,Rock Hudson's last theatrical film.  Able support is provided by Robert Mitchum and Ellen Burstyn. Lots of action in the middle east. Probably more for Hudson completists than anyone else but worth your time to watch.,1361491200,3,217,5.027777777777778
4306838,5,B004AAXDM8,Great movie about issues inhibiting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  Cast is spectacular especially Robert Mitchum and Ellen Burstyn,1354492800,5,143,6.15
4306839,3,B004AAXDM8,"saw this on betamax in 1980,ok late night viewing,then a big box vhs,but now a top of the range dvd release,nice to see film crystal clear at last,it`s like watching for the first time,a pity movie is not top rate entertainment,ok story of middle east problems,some action but film tries to please everyones point of view on the subject and comes off looking very cheesy at the end,if you want a no brainer late at night,as we found back in 1980 on beta it`s ok,but would not be high on anybodies owning list,and Mitchum and Hudson look and feel too old for the parts they play.",1317081600,2,578,4.462264150943396
8419913,4,B004AAXDM8,"A good and adventurous political movie, but with a somewhat illogical ending.  As usual, Robert Mitchum delivers a fine ""nice tough guy"" performance.  Nevertheless, the film portrays a Jew vs. Arab Middle East situation with a hopeful conclusion, which is totally unrealistic.",1495497600,,276,5.5476190476190474
8419914,5,B004AAXDM8,"I saw this DVD on Saturday and was blown away by the great acting and the stellar cast. Hudson and Mitchum were incredible in their last theatrical roles. Mitchum had a way of making hard roles look easy and with his hard-nosed style he gets away with it. I loved Hudson's role as the CIA man assigned to protect Mitchum. And protect him he does.

I saw this film as a child years ago on cable and always wanted it on DVD. Unfortunately it took many years more for the DVD to be released. If you like an action thriller set on location where two worlds are constantly clashing this is your film. Remember that it takes place at the end of the Cold War and much of what you see in the film is obsolete and/or dated--even the procedures they use.

I give this film Five Stars. buy it and you won't be disappointed.

8419920,5,B004AAXDM8,Robert Mitchum is at his best and always seems to know how to handle a scene. It is a very good film & I will know doubt watch it many times. When one has seen such good acting for so many years it seems he was born to act. He is in this one more but in his beginning he did not want to be in front of the camera for more than 5 hours & would refuse parts that required more. Then they would offer him more money just to get HIM. He would rather go fishing & could never understand the wealth he created without even trying. In the end of El Dorado there were no lines written so he & John Wayne just ad libbed them. This movie shows the ease & control he had plus his gifted speaking voice. You will enjoy this movie.,1422921600,,718,3.858108108108108
8419921,5,B004AAXDM8,"I have enjoyed this movie for what seems like half my lifetime.  Back in the 70's (maybe early 80's; can't remember which) I thought it was a silly cliche on an intractable world situation.  Today it really is a silly cliche, but one I have longed for since Arafat started blowing up airliners in the late 60's.  I guess there is nothing more stupid than an Arab extremist, but they seem to grow more common and more stupid with each passing day.  Anyway, this is a very good movie; I enjoy it each time I see it, and believe that Robert Mitchum plays a wonderful role and does Ellen Burnstyn.",1419379200,4,593,4.363636363636363
