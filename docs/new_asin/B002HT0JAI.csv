What I love about this cooking show is that it includes Giada's family, her husband Todd and her beautiful baby girl Jade. Giada is one of the best chefs on Food Network.",1265414400,3,302,4.410714285714286

8370519,5,B002HT0JAI,"I love Giada's shows although I think her recipes are less and less Italian. She might be adding some diversity in her recipes nut in my opinion she is hitting the wall. Many recipes start to look all the same.
I still like her shows because I can use many of her tips in my cooking.",1368403200,,283,4.071428571428571

8370521,3,B002HT0JAI,"Took forever to get here!  Placed my order, took forever to ship and finally, weeks later I've received it!  Was supposed to be new condition, but when my wife opened it she looked at me as though I was some kind of bum!  The box was damaged, roughed-up, and heavily stained; the dvds had been opened and had finger-prints all over them!  Wish I had stuck to my guns and bought used from sellers I've done business with in the past!  At least the product is great - my wife LOVES Giada!",1294704000,,486,4.239130434782608
