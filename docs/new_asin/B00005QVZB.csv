7951239,5,B00005QVZB,"Saw this many years ago in a theatre. There was  a lot going on at once, underneath the surface story and actions and I bought it because I really wanted to see it again. I found the intimate encounters intriguing. This particular tale of family crises was done well, nothing rehashed or old hat. The whole move had beautiful nuances of a time, a place, a family. A satisfying ending.",1401494400,,384,4.485714285714286
7951240,3,B00005QVZB,"Sexually active attractive to women female seeks satisfaction by aggressively pursuing ""normal sex"" with no lack of finding a steady partner as mother of her passed away.

As the most of the UK-produced, this DVD is overpriced.",1208822400,,227,5.135135135135135
7951241,4,B00005QVZB,The movie in this DVD or VHS is talking more about one woman is having sex with different man after the death of the mother and the two woman later had a row and later reconciled(not going to review too much or become useless). This one is more towards the erotic story rather than actions but the actions are mostly using verbal method to explain roughly how the sex between the men progress on two of the sex scenes while the others are just like seeing to person in bed and goes to the next scenario saying that they already have sex. This is what is all about but story is still considered erotic.,1063670400,,601,4.280701754385965
7951242,2,B00005QVZB,"Was this movie worth watching?  Possibly, but I wish I'd rented it.  Erotic?  No, not unless you like seeing the star getting peed on (fully clothed).  Brief nudity.  No love or tenderness.",1062892800,6,189,4.78125
7951243,5,B00005QVZB,"Emotionally wrenching, gripping, highly charged, yet thoroughly engaging film featuring the debut performance of Samantha Morton. Credit must also go to Carine Adler, the director who displayed a  wonderful sense of restraint and pacing and was able to fully explore the complexities of Morton's character (as well as everyone else) without having to lapse into stereotype or broad-strokes. This film is everything a film such as ""Girl Interrupted"" wasn't. Quite simply, everyone is laid out in three dimensions and it's up to the audience to decide who is right or not. I was completely gripped by this film and left it feeling a sense of release and satisfaction to having witnessed it. Clearly, if directors like Adler continue their fine work, and actors like Samantha Morton (as likewise, the rest of the cast) continue doing projects like this, we're in for a very rewarding period of film making. Rita Tushingham is, as always, a pleasure to see work - although she has a small part, it is by no means wasted. Hers is a riveting presence and she sets the tone for the action to follow. This movie fairly bursts with energy while at the same time showing incredible restraint. In short, it is brilliant.",993945600,11,1209,4.897560975609756
7951244,5,B00005QVZB,"i recently saw this film on testerrial tv at 1 in the morning, and im glad i stayed up for it.  the story follows two sisters who have recently lost their mother and the very different ways they deal with it.  samantha morton's character decides to go on a number of short and violent affairs with a whole line of bastards, with dark but entertaining results.",979603200,10,359,4.424242424242424
