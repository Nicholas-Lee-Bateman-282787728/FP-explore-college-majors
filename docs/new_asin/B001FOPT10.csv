8302186,5,B001FOPT10,"McCaffrey has a remarkable resume: studio head, director, casting director, producer. With such a multifaceted perspective, she really knows what delineates the successful actor from the also-ran. This DVD is a priceless ally to the beginning actor and a great resource for seasoned talent. As someone in the later category, I've found McCaffrey to be a remarkable source of guidance. And now everyone has access to this same professional's wellspring of industry smarts. Don't just get a copy; commit to applying it!",1222732800,,517,5.317073170731708
