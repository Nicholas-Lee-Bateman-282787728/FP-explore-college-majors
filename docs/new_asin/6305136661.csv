  First of all, I would recommend that you take a look at this film on YouTube, where
you can see it saved in 8 parts. This would both save me much explanation and wet your appetite.
Even there, the quality has suffered greatly, but you can get an idea
of what the film was shooting for. It was filmed in Mystimation which tried to capture the feel of
the earliest photographic equipment and the feel of wonder around the turn of the century. I saw a
very good print of this movie about twenty years ago, and it is well worth the experience. There are
as yet, very few films that fit into the relatively new genre of 'Steam-punk' but this film should be
enshrined as it's great grandfather and is a must have for affectianados of that genre, Sci-fi and

It is a magnificent example of Karl Zeman's work, which are hard to come by in the USA.  This film and his version of Baron Munchasen are animation related masterpieces.  You might say he is the Ray Harrehausen of Czeckslovakia.  These films use to appear on late night television in the 60s and 70s but are no longer broadcast.

994093,4,6305136661,"A pleasantly charming version of Jules Verne's ""The Destructive Invention"", this Czech effort boasts terrific art direction and special effects design that makes the film seem like moving versions of the original woodcut illustrations. The effect of it is truely unique. Not animation, this live action film uses a plethora of effects techniques that give us the best filmed view yet of a Verne work.
The epic scale of the movie comes across well, especially in the island scenes near the end of the movie. Though the film starts out slowly and the pacing is awkward, tension builds to a literally explosive climax as the absolute destructive power of the title invention becomes clear.
The well written and lushly orchestrated musical score adds much to the building tension, as well as conveying the charm of the 19th century rivet-and-cast iron technology. Though the musical editing leaves a bit to be desired (several awkward music cuts are present), the art direction and set design is superb and is very true to the visions of the great 19th century author. Character development is a bit lacking, but this is also true of many of Verne's works.
While not dramatically up to par with the film version of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", ""The Fabulous World of Jules Verne"" is every bit a visual treat as the Disney movie and is perhaps truer to Verne's vision of technology. It remains the the purest film version to date of a Verne work.
The tape includes a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the making of this movie. It is practically a how-to lesson in the effects techniques of the film and is well worth watching. The video transfer is nicely done with only a couple of splices noticable on the source print.",973468800,13,1723,4.824324324324325
994234,3,6305136661,"This review is for 'The Fabulous World of Jules Verne' by Nostalgia Family

While the movie is terrific and one of the best sci-fi movies to come out of the 50's the quality of the DVD is not. There is no option for subtitles (though it is in English) nor are there any extra's.

So I'm giving this 5 stars for the movie and it's great special effects and 1 star for the presentation.

This movie definitely falls into the category of 'steampunk' which to me is a good thing. It's a combination of animation and live action. The animation was done by legendary Czech animator, Karel Zeman who is well known here in the United States for 'Baron Munchausen.'

'The Fabulous World of Jules Verne' takes parts of several Jules Verne stories. Most prominently, Zeman uses 'Facing the Flag.' Most people who watch this movie will automatically see the similarities to '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.' However, the basic plot of the story follows 'Facing the Flag' very closely. Scenes from '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' take place during the middle portion of the movie. Most notably a Nautilus like submarine,sinks a ship and the crew carries off treasure from the ocean floor. There are also some scenes reminiscent of 'Mysterious Island.' In the first five minutes, which serves as the introduction, you see various devices from Verne stories including the airship from 'Master of the World.'

The movie opens with Simon Hart, who narrates throughout the movie, returning home from a trip abroad in which he has seen many wonders. He is assisting a scientist, Professor Roche, who is researching 'pure matter.' One night the both of them are kidnapped from Roche's mansion by a bunch of pirates. The pirates are led by Count Artigas who is the captain of a stolen submarine (similar to the Nautilus). Artigas convinces Professor Roche to work for him. He provides a laboratory and any assistance he needs for him to continue his research. Artigas' is plotting to take over the world by using Professor Roche's research to build him new and powerful explosives. Artigas is staying at a volcanic island. Hart and Roche are both taken by the submarine to the island. The interior can only be reached by submarine or airship. Hart is kept separate from Roche at the island and is allowed a laboratory of his own. He is not fooled the way Roche is. Hart spends his time on the island deceiving Artigas of his true intentions which is to somehow stop him. From here it's up to Hart to somehow stop the pirates and/or convince Professor Roche to stop his assistance.

Watching this movie is highly recommended. Purchasing this particular version is another matter.

Recommended for all fans of 50's sci-fi and steampunk fans. I watched this for the first time on youtube. If you don't have to own it, I'd wait for a better release.",1462492800,,2821,4.7566462167689165

994241,4,6305136661,"What a Historical Gem this is! Having first viewed this rare Foreign film in one of my classes way back in the 1960's it served to further my interest in the Cinematic Arts!  By today's standards this is but a primitive effort and an occasional viewer may quickly criticize or dismiss it as a poor choice of one of the many great Jules Verne films available.  This is a technological masterpiece that blends live action with a backdrop of incredibly precise and detailed drawings, use of moveable props all under the the method called ""Mystimation""-- pure fantasy and remarkably well done.  I am certain the Director, Karel Zeman was influenced by another pioneer in the science fiction genre, Ray Harryhausen whose ""Superdynamation"" technique utilized a similar stop-action photography with miniature subjects......Although this is a Czech film the English dialogue is dubbed almost perfectly and the acting is quite convincing. The late 1950's saw the birth of Science Fiction movies and The Fabulous World of Jules Verne marked one of European Cinema's first endeavors into this cinematic arena (incredible indeed considering the Political temperament in Czechloslovakia 1958!)

I've only given this DVD four stars, because the print quality is less than perfect. That aside, I would give this totally enjoyable fantasy film five stars. How can you explain the look and feel of this movie to someone who's never seen it? The simplest way I can imagine is to say, it's like reading an old copy of an illustrated Jules Verne novel, and having the engraved illustrations come to life. Going beyond this, there's many humorous and  odd details that make the whole experience extremely enjoyable. Some of the scenes will make you laugh out loud!

994305,4,6305136661,"This movie says it adapts a Jules Verne story, ""The Deadly Invention,"" to which I find no reference elsewhere. If anything, this might be inspired by 20,000 Leagues, but only vaguely - it has submarines and a power-mad recluse. That's about where similarities stop. You won't see it for that reason.

You'll see it because it's one of the most varied, inventive, campy, and low-of-budget films anywhere. It combines the exaggerations of silent film, painted sets of PBS Mystery's intro, inanely earnest spirit of the 1930s Buck Rogers serials, animations in the Terry Gilliam spirit, and too many other looks to identify in this space. And a pasted-on love interest, of course.

And stripes. Striped clothing, striped textures in the painted props, striped rays of sunlight, stripes of smoke against the sky as the convoy of steamships approaches. Stripes appear anywhere there's half a reason for them, and lots more besides. And birds - just about every outdoor scene has something flying around, maybe lots of somethings, whether or not there's visual reason for it. Likewise the underwater scenes, except that fish replace birds.

994308,5,6305136661,"This movie was only a vague childhood memory until I rediscovered it here on Amazon. I had only remembered small sections of an old-fashioned looking, black and white movie with strange undersea creatures. I was probably 4 or 5 years old when I saw this on TV, and it made a lasting impression on me. I have a short list of vague early TV memories that have been a mystery throughout my adult life. This one remained elusive because I'd always thought that it was a much older film, probably from the 1920s and the early days of cinema, and I didn't connect it with Jules Verne at all.

When I stumbled on this one here on Amazon, I thought that MAYBE this was the same film I'd seen only once almost 50 years earlier. One look at the trailer and I knew I'd finally found it, so I immediately rented it. All those fond memories came rushing back. Besides solving a long-time mystery for me, the film itself is an amazing piece of special effects work, and especially ambitious considering it was made in 1958. Yes, it's disjointed and grainy, the sound is terrible, and the print is not at all restored in any way, so it seems really rough by today's standards. But I don't care.  I grinned through the entire piece and enjoyed every minute of it. Yes, the acting is stiff, but I sense that the actors had no clear idea of the animation into which their scenes would be inserted. I think that it was shot on a blank stage, and all the multiple special effects shots were superimposed in camera, which, though this technique was well established already in hundreds of other films before it, here it was treated like a piece of art.

The imaginative use of period-looking woodcuts really captured the feel of Jules Verne's world perfectly, and reminded me a lot of Terry Gilliam's early animation work, on whom I suspect this film was an influence. If you're a fan of those classic Monty Python animations, you'll see what I mean when you watch this film, which has its own wonderful little moments of visual humor. This is an almost-forgotten gem that should be required viewing for any fan of science fiction or film history.

The characters are rather cool, perhaps,  and seem somewhat distant from the viewer but they take second place to the virtuoso special effects  and what effects they are!  The drawings are so real they pop off the screen and the music is absolutely wonderful - full Twentieth Century in this case
(but the music composed at the time of Verne's day would seem inappropriate to a modern audience). This is rather like the most elaborate of magic shows and we are willing to sit back and be amused and amazed.  Bravo Karel Zeman! Long Live Czech animation!
