1355631,4,B00004UD5I,"The videos of the Baby Einstein company have an effect on our 20-month old like no other (and this has been the case since he was 10-months old).  He greets the puppets like old friends and is enraptured by the sights and sounds.  I sense that part of the series' attraction is the simplicity of the visuals:  bare backgrounds and one or two toys and puppets.  These ""toy tableaus"" are interspersed with some lush nature photography in this video, but these segments are only at the beginning and the end.  The music's instrumentation is  pared down as well.  For the very young it seems that a lot of videos ostensibly produced for them are too busy and too noisy.
As far as Baby Van Gogh in particular, it really has a lot of wonderful qualities.  The idea of dividing it into ""chapters"" based on individual colors is great.  Our child gets a whole color ""experience"", seeing it in toys,puppets, live action photos and of course the Van Gogh paintings (several of which were unfamiliar to me).  The music is mostly rousing and danceable.  The only annoying part (at least to this parent) are the space-agy music breaks between chapters.  At least these are short.
Each color  features a poem written and read by the filmaker Julie Clark. These emphasize the emotions of each color and are enjoyable--although ""when I am blue I put some happy in my stew"" irks me every time I hear it.  This video is closest in spirit to Baby Shakespeare and would be an excellent follow-up to it.  If I were intending to produce a toddler's video I would spend hours and hours studying the products of this company.  They really have the touch.",977184000,28,1629,4.604166666666667
1355632,4,B00004UD5I,"This is a beautiful video!! The colors are bright and cheery. The music is perfectly suited. And the puppet, Van Goat, is an absolute delight!! I strongly feel that Julie Clark should have hired a professional voice artist. Her voice lacks ""umph"" and is unstimulating. And, I don't think that it was necessary to include all the scenes of the children. While some scenes flowed nicely, others were quite disruptive. I think the Van Goat puppet could have carried this entire video without the children. My son absolutely loved him!!",975196800,4,532,4.9222222222222225

It did not hold her interest like a couple of the other Baby Einstein titles (specifically the ones about animals).  After a few months, though, she became more and more interested in ""Mr. Goat"" and his paintings, and we used the video to reinforce color-learning and promote discussions about the different ways art is made.  Now that she is a three-year old, she still watches it on occasion but nothing like she used to.

Good music, I like the poems, funny puppets etc.  But it was only 23 minutes long!  You're killing me Julie!  Some of us rely on the half hour of Baby Einstein time to get supper on the table, and a little more time would be helpful!  I'm not a huge fan of repeat play or watching more than one video a day, I'd rather just let them pick their video for the day and have it stick to that.

1355788,2,B00004UD5I,"This Einstein video is a great first step to learning colors. But when buying a B.E. video keep the following in mind and ask yourself, ""Is it really worth it?"":
Julie Clark likes to add her poems.  Children don't typically appreciate poems, especially ones that don't make much sense. And as with every B.E. video, there's your occasional repeat clips that they use to fill the time, and of course those lovely 2-3 second black screens.  Oh, not to mention my favorite...having to fast-forward through 2 previews, finally getting to the main menu, and then having to fast-forward through 3 more previews! I am so perplexed that Disney would feel the need to put SO MANY previews on EVERY SINGLE B.E. video (with the exception of 2 or 3, out of 15!).  They're kids!! They're not interested in previews, and the parents don't need to see them every single day! We've got impatient kids, WORK WITH US DISNEY!! Okay, done venting.  This is why I give a rating of 2 stars.  I'm fed up with having to sit through previews on every video. By the way, why are we paying around $15 for DVDs that aren't even full-length movies.  They're 20 minutes long! (...and low-budge production to boot.) It's time to lower that outrageous price.  Who's with me?!!",1284336000,9,1244,4.678899082568807

I wanted to get more Baby Einstein videos for my almost one-year-old so she wouldn't be watching the same ones over and over. Well, this one was a disappointment for me. The kicker is that it seems to be the highest rated of the Baby Einstein videos! Did you even watch it??

My main issue, was the speech sound quality. The music was perfect, and the music volume was great, but when they actually talked, I couldn't hear them well enough to understand any of it. I thought I was going deaf! They punctuated the video with bits of poetry about each color, but what's the point of that if you can't even hear it? It sounds like they recorded the speech on an old cassette tape in a bathroom! To be fair, here are the pros and cons of the video:

Negatives:
-Vocal recording quality is poor, at best
-The puppetry was rough, and inexpressive compared their usual high quality of work
-Obnoxious 80's-ish sound effects with no apparent purpose

Positives:
-Beautiful classical music
-Cute and interesting video montages

I'd like to note that the positives are true of the GOOD Baby Einstein videos as well, but the negatives are not. I highly recommend ""My First Signs"" and ""First Words: Around the House.""

I cant say its due to him watching these videos but I can say they have not harmed my children! My 5 year old also watched these and has been writing letters and spelling out words since he was 2. I think these videos are helpful in teaching children. I wouldnt stick them in front of them all day everyday but they are a good supplement to you teaching your children.

We didn't think she was old enough to know her colors yet, so we hadn't started teaching them to her. Then, one day, she just starts pointing to objects and saying, ""blue"" and ""red,"" etc. My child has watched this video dozens of times in the last 9 months or so and never tires of it. She especially likes the character of Vincent, and likes the books with him in them as well. Not only has she learned her colors, she has recognized Van Gogh artwork when we've seen it out in the ""real"" world. She points at it and starts babbling excitedly.

1355835,4,B00004UD5I,"There have been a lot of reviews written about all of the video products designed for infants to pre-school age children; some good and some bad. Since so many have been posted I was going to forgo writing a review of the product, even though I normally do write up something for all the products I  purchases online, because I know that product reviews help me when deciding to purchase a product online.

However, after reading a review that rated these products low based on statistical and case studies done by the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) or the APA (American Physiological Association) I changed my mind and decided to pen my two cents.

Before I get into why I feel information like that should not be so carelessly thrown around, I would fist like to say that parents should use their own common sense and judgment when purchasing and using any products for their children. In most cases this will produce the best results for your child, and I would trust the judgment, and the experience, of parents that have successfully raised several children over that of person who holds a Doctorate or PhD; especially considering, from my own experience, that the time required to get those heavy weight educations is time not spent raising children.

I could explain the common fallacies behind the validity of data collected from statistical surveys of relatively small numbers, or putting to much weight to premises based solely on authority, but most educated people today understand these basic critical thinking skills, even though they may not know the jargon. Instead I will take a couple of the ""statistical studies"" that were quoted, not cited though, and apply them to my own observation of my son while watching these videos.

The first statistical example I saw posted, without proper citation and reference needed to check it, was this: that the brainwave activity of children was recorded to be lower while watching TV then it is when sleeping. I will skip over the fact that the age of the children were not noted, nor was the specific television content they were watching. I will also refrain from a monologue concerning higher than usual brainwave activity being normal during certain phases of the sleep cycle. What I do know is that when my son watches one of these videos his level of excitement is amazing. He tries to dance, play with his toys, yells, sings, and basically is having a great time. Unfortunately, I do not own my own EEG, nor would it be possible to attach all the electrodes to the skull without strapping him down, so I can not positively refute that claim; however, I think I made my point.

The second AAP study I saw referred to, again not referenced, stated that a child has a 10% chance of developing ADD for every hour they watch television. This person also stated that five hours of television a day would result in a 50% chance of developing ADD. I will skip over the fact that ADD is one of the highest misdiagnosed psychological disorders in children, but I can imagine if I asked our pediatrician to start our son on Riddlin because we plan on allowing him to watch Baby E. for four hours a day what he would say. Besides thinking we were nuts he might suggest we seek psychological treatment. These studies show correlation in data and the cause and effect involved is the problems being researched, however; common sense tells us that allowing our child to watch television for 10 hours in a single day will not automatically give them ADD or any other psychosis. These studies are for research purposes to help physicians understand certain disorders; they are not intended to be used as strict parenting guidelines. If you are concerned about how much television is too much, then ask your child's healthcare provider. Although, I think most parents know what is too much, and allowing these videos to keep them entertained for a few hours a day is most likely more beneficial overall; parents have to be able to get a break now and then and if they don't then stress can become a problem for the whole family.

I personally think these videos, all of the ones developed for this age group, are both educational and a great help to parents, but what I think does not matter. Parents and their  children will decide if they are right for themselves, and setting a child down to watch these videos for a few hours a day does not make anyone a bad parent. They will be a great asset for some families, and for others they may not have a place. If unsure about them, buy one and try it; if it works out then great, and if it does not then don't purchase more.

The main point I wanted to make, trust your own judgment and don't over analyze what is right for your child. Most importantly, do not feel guilty about using these videos when unknown strangers start waving psychological statistics at you and claiming bad parenting techniques; most likely that person does not have children. ;-)",1242950400,3,4956,4.68735632183908

We have several other Baby Einstein DVD's and this is probably my least favorite.  It is supposed to help children learn their colors, but all it basically does is show a bunch of toys and objects that are of various colors without repeating what the color is.  For example:  It will say/show the word ""yellow"" and then spend a few minutes showing some yellow things, playing some music and reciting poems (really lame ones, by the way, that have nothing to do with colors). My child is ""entertained"" by the video at most, he will watch it, but has learned nothing from it.

1355842,4,B00004UD5I,"This is an very good DVD, and you can read the other reviews to find out why. But I give it 4 stars because I find it objectionable that they subject the viewer--in this case, a baby!--to so much advertising and branding. Their corporate logo stays on the screen repeatedly, for a very long time...quite a bit longer than any of the van Gogh paintings!!!

Another weak point of this DVD is that the lovely classical music is reproduced on a synthesizer. If they really cared about introducing children to classical music in the best way, they would have licensed recordings of the world's great orchestras and soloists to use as their soundtrack. Not that all the music would have to be orchestral, but synthesizer has its limitations, esp. with a piece like ""Bolero"" that sounds terrific played by an orchestra.

Also, every couple of minutes they present a couple of hyperactive oddly-colored snowmen accompanied by frenetic music. I make a point of fast-forwarding through this...I find these intruders rather annoying and don't understand why the producers included them, except to bend to some kind of marketing research that they had to include some hyper music.

A final quibble: as they introduce each color, they include a little poem about the color. However the sound volume of the poem is considerably lower than the music that preceded it. In short, we can't hear it unless we turn up the volume for every poem, and then turn it down when the program continues.",1235088000,,1474,4.841269841269841

She is not mistaking ""goat"" for the word movie since she says ""movie"" or ""TV"" on the rare occasion that she wants to watch something else.  If we hold out 3-4 dvd cases for her to choose from, she always picks this one if it is there.

She loves the puppets, jumps up and down for certain scenes and laughs out loud often every time she watches it.

She usually sits on our lap, but always has to get up and dance for one particular song, then comes back to snuggle. She has started telling us what is coming next 1 second before it comes on the screen.  (purple, ball, yellow, car etc...)

1355877,1,B00004UD5I,"The name ""Baby Einstein"" is a nice way to lull parents into feeling okay about their babies watching tv, but according to the American Academy of Pediatrics babies should not be exposed to television at all before they're 2 years old!  According to Time Magazine and the Boston Globe,

""...among babies ages 8 months to 16 months, every hour spent daily watching programs such as 'Brainy Baby' or 'Baby Einstein' translated into six to eight fewer words in their vocabularies as compared with other children their age.""

Brain wave activity in babies is actually slower when watching television than when *sleeping*, and yet another study shows that for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of having an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%. (Example, 5 hours a day = 50% greater chance of ADD). I like William Sears' advice that ""relationships, not things, make babies smarter"". The easiest way to make babies smarter? Carry them in a sling, since it is proven to make them smarter because they are relating to you physically, emotionally, verbally, and visually. For more information carrying a baby in a sling see the Listmania list ""Natural Parenting for Baby's First Year"".  Also, if you want to check the facts out for yourself you can start by google-ing ""television and baby studies"".",1200355200,12,1323,4.972850678733032
1355878,4,B00004UD5I,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1925,4.928792569659443

Nothing can tear her away from Baby Van Gogh while some of the other Einstein videos like Bach and Mozart lose her attention span quickly.

I really like that the video is broken out into different segments and each segment focuses on a different color.  It starts off with the color yellow.  Baby Van ""Goat"" comes out on the screen and begins painting a yellow Van Gogh which is then followed by footage of yellow sunflowers and baby chicks.  Soon they are showing yellow children's toys, puppets and children dressed in yellow shouting the word, ""yellow"".  You get the idea.

At the time I showed it to her (about 14 mos.), she was in a phase where books no longer held her interest, but she watched this 30 min. video from start to finish without getting distracted. She was not ""zoned out"" either though, which I was watching for, but just really interested in what she saw and heard. The only criticism I have is that the DVD is not verbal enough. They say each color only twice and outside of a couple poems, there is not much language at all. Since English is a foreign language where we live, I really wanted her to get more reinforcement from the DVD. On the other hand, this lack of language forces me to watch the DVD with her each time so that I can say the color several times and describe what we see on the screen with words... which is probably the idea behind the program, anyway!",1136246400,2,1178,4.216814159292035

I've been showing him the Baby Einstein videos since 3 months (and I have reviewed all the ones we own).  Like previous reviewers have said, the poems are ridiculous and the way Julie reads them is horrible.  I know these are supposed to be ""teaching aides"" as opposed to a distraction for mom to get away, but I know most moms use these as a way to take a quick shower or get some dishes done, therefore, the toys they float across the screen don't really have any learning purpose (pointing out the colors or having poems that deal with ""real world"" items in that specific color would be more effective).

Whatever happened to comparing colors to things children recognize like frogs and grapes? The dvd would be 5 star if not for the sad attempt at poetry.

1355949,3,B00004UD5I,"Confession: I do not care much for Baby Einstein DVDs.  For that reason some might consider me a bad mommy.  Yet in my defense, I didn't sit my daughter purposefully infront of the TV until she was over a year old, which to others, is no great accomplishment either, but sometimes I want to sleep in and get a shower for the day :)

Anyway, For those that love Baby Einstein (BE), you don't need to read these reviews, especially mine.  But for those who are wondering, let me offer a non-passionate point of view.  I think B.E. DVDs are a good introduction to basic concepts for pre-toddlers.  But I don't find these interactive enough to teach my toddler colors, shapes, etc, which I thought was their purpose.  Of course this seems to be the basis for many B.E. devotees--not overly-stimulating and in your face, etc, which they aren't, but I think mesmerizing, and passive are more accurate descriptions. The pictures and music are delightful.  The poems (and Julie's voice,) however, I find to be dreadful.  Also, I hardly think naming the colors only twice during each 5 min segment is enough to keep toddlers clear on what they are seeing.  I believe repetition and communication are the best teaching tools.  Which is probably why nearly every video contains the ""These are designed to be educational helps"" disclaimer, which is fine if that's your style--I much more prefer a more hands on approach, touching things in HER real world, rather looking at things in the somebody else's real world.

Conclusion: These are fine for pre-toddlers, as an educational HELP, or sheer entertainment, but not solely for teaching concepts.",1116374400,12,1635,4.841726618705036
1355950,1,B00004UD5I,"The music in this dvd is nice.  That's about the only good thing.  The toys they show between color segments really have no real purpose but to fill up time (like most Baby Einstein videos, in my opinion).  The colors they show are yellow, green, orange, purple, red and blue.

Each color has puppets and a poem is recited (again, I find Julie's voice annoying).  Here's an example of the poem for the color purple: ""Purple feels wacky, wild, crazy, tricky, mellow, mild.  It makes me want to paint my face, kick a ball and run a race.""  For the color red the poem is, ""When I wake up feeling red, I swoop down from my little bed, throw on a cape and rush out the door and leap across the scarlet floor.""

OK....to me these poems are just dumb.  Other people proably think they are great, but I can't see having my child sit and watch this and listen to these ridiculous poems.  I have written reviews for all other Baby Einstein videos, so please read them too.",1116288000,52,962,4.324022346368715

Then, we are blasted by the music.  If I have to leave the room for a couple of seconds and turn the volume up so my son can hear the colors announced the subsequent music blasts our eardrums.  The company needs to have done a better job of evening out the volume in production.  As an aside, the children shown are often cheesing heavily for the camera which is nauseating -- I'm not sure why the creators didn't just show the kids playing.  I gave it 3 stars because the CD is very creative -- for each color there are children wearing and playing with different items of that color, the background will be of that particular color, toys will be shown of that color, the host puppet goat will act as if he's painting a Van Gogh painting that has that color as the dominant color, etc.  However, clearly stating those colors to reinforce the teaching done at home is a primary purpose of this DVD and because of the audio problem it fails in that aspect.",1111795200,3,1217,4.307017543859649

This video has puppets that my children absolutely love, great classical music, a theme (learning colors) and structure.  We also have Baby Doolittle: Neighborhood Animals, whcih is also great, and Baby Newton, which is not quite as good but still worth having.  My kids are now two and four and they still watch this once in a while and enjoy it.",1087084800,,459,4.573170731707317

The music in this one is fun, and the puppet clips are actually humorous to an adult.  The live action sequence are wonderful too, especially the introduction one with toys, animals and other things of every color.  (And the annoying kids are kept to a minimum in this one, no corny jokes)
That being said...
This one won't hold my daughter's attention as well as some of the others.  She'll watch a bit, and then it's off to explore the house!  So this is one we'll put on in the background when we are playing other games, simply for the great music.  I dig deeper in to the baby einstein series when I want one to have her watch while I prepare her lunch, or grab some laundry.  For older babies, I recommend ""Baby Neptune"" or ""Neighborhood Animals"", which are her current favorites.  For younger babies, the composer DVD's are like a magic on fussy babies, baby Mozart was an early favorite.",1086307200,2,1027,4.391534391534392

My 15-month-old son has never been able to sit still for a meal, for a diaper change or a change of his clothes, but the minute I put in this DVD, he was transfixed and did not budge for the whole duration of the show.  The music was a wonderful match with the visuals.  I really like the way they introduce each color sequentially and gather all the elements that feature that particular color.  The result is a beautiful tapestry of sight, sound and colors.  Even my 5-year-old daughter was mesmerized.  I have watched it 5 times now and I still find it very entertaining.  This fall, when I travel to Asia with my kids, I will invest in a portable DVD player and bring along this DVD to keep the kids entertained on a very long flight.
My son has also wathced other Baby Einstein DVDs and this one is his absolute favorite, followed by Baby Newton.  He has no interest in the Baby Nursery Language DVD, nor the Neighborhood Animal one.  I share his view preference as well.  I thought Baby Newton is well done, but I was not impressed with Neighborhood Animal and found Baby Nursery Language sub-par.",1085616000,,1138,4.475728155339806

This video is indeed fit for babies even before they can babble. It introduces them to the main colors with a host of images introducing Vincent (Van Gogh, played by a blue puppett of a goat) that are presented in a more structured way than in ""Baby Mozart"", once again accompanied by some gorgeous classical music (a few bits from Musorgsky's very appropriate ""Pictures at an Exhibition"", along with a some Tchaikovsky, Ravel and Brahms, among others). If you stick the DVD in your computer, you will gain access to a PDF (Portable Document Format) version of the Printed Coloring Book. All in all, this is probably one of the best DVDs you can get to your baby, whether s/he is an infant, a toddler or beyond that, since well after the initial excitement due to its colorfulnes, it will continue to have an educational value.",1082764800,4,1044,4.588235294117647

I have been showing this video to her since she was 2 months old, regardless of the ""recommended"" age of the videos, and she is completely encaptured by them all, but this one in particular.

I can get him to sleep or to stop crying. I do not know what I would do without them. I have all the videos so my baby can never get tired of watching it over again.

In other words, our daughter is more mesmerized through and through with Baby Van Gogh.  The other two are great as well, but Baby Mozart seems to have a few very slow spots that has my daughter losing attention and whimpering.

I am not sure why, but the three Baby Einstein videos we own (so far) each get our one-year old's rapt attention from beginning to end.  I think it's in part the superior production values (cinematography, sound, editing, color, pacing, etc.) that far, far exceed the horde of imitators (of which we have been disappointed by at least half-a-dozen that we thought were carefully selected).  But there must be something in the content as well, because our very active, bright, and inquisitive son settles right in every night for his pre-bed time Baby Einstein video.  I don't expect him to integrate much real knowledge about the Van Gogh paintings featured in this one, but I'd sure rather that he start with them than with the pabulum served up on PBS, etc.  If you buy any video for your pre-toddler or toddler, make it one of the Baby Einstein series.",1076457600,,906,4.672955974842767

We have several others, but the boys didn't like the ""teaching"" ones as well as the just music - Galileo or Neptune with the nature scenes didn't used to cut it for them. They much preferred the Beethoven that didn't have sections beyond the different symphonies.
Now, though, that they can identify items and some of the colors, they really are into this one. The paintings are lovely, of course, but so are the images used to convey the colors in everyday life.
I know some reviewers are turned off by all the shots of the kids, but my kids seem to like seeing those scenes. They also really are enjoying the animal/nature scenes now that they can point and say the words more often.

I was afraid that nothing would hold my son's attention like Baby Mozart did.  I bought Baby Bach, Beethoven and Dolittle: World Animals hoping that they would be a big hit.  Beethoven and Dolittle came very close, but he grew bored of them quickly.  I was initially skeptical about Baby Van Gogh for some reason, but I decided to purchase it anyway and give it a try.
I wish I would have bought it sooner.  Once Baby Van Gogh started playing on the television, my son remained glued in one spot until it was over.  He *loves* it.  He was enthralled with the puppets, the colors and the various toys.  Baby Van Gogh gets a big thumbs up in our household.
However, as every child is different, it really depends upon what your child likes.  My son happens to adore puppets and Baby Van Gogh has lots of puppets.  I think the transition from one color to the next also holds his attention.  And finally, yes, Julie Clark's children are in this DVD, but like another posted said at one point, I've come to expect them, it's nice to see them there.",1060819200,3,1189,4.301801801801802

The other nice feature is the Concert Hall where you can listen to the soundtrack of the DVD.  The Brainy Baby DVD I own only plays one song, but this has 19 tracks that play for over 33 minutes!  So when your baby is tired of watching the DVD, your baby can listen to classical music instead.  It's like getting a DVD and music CD all in one.  Again, you can choose to have the music repeat itself automatically.  The quality of this DVD is just as good as the Brainy Baby DVDs.  Nice, clear picture and sound.

There are a number of segments on each of the basic colors, showing toys and nature photography that feature those colors. There are children also illustrating the colors (a little girl holding a lemon, boys holding a blue umbrella, etc.). Some of the other Baby Einstein videos feature only girls in live-action shots, but Baby Van Gogh has an even mix of boys and girls. I doubt my son really cares one way or the other, but I liked that aspect. The music featured in this video/DVD is also impressive. There are selections from some classical favorites like the William Tell Overture or Bolero. It's nice to have some variety, as opposed to an entire video of Bach or Mozart. Another thing that impressed me about this video is the artwork they use to further illustrate certain colors. For each color, they have a different painting by Van Gogh (Starry Night for blue, Sunflowers for Orange, and so on). This video brings together so many different aspects and blends them together seamlessly: art, nature, music. At the end of the video, there is also a segment that details the toys shown throughout the program and their manufacturer. So in case you're impressed with any of the items featured, you can buy them for yourself. Truly, this video more than any other provides a complete ""Baby Einstein"" experience. It's sure to be a favorite in any home.",1029974400,121,1462,4.71484375
1356021,5,B00004UD5I,"As one who strongly supports reading to children, I was a ""little"" anti-TV for my youngster, until watching THIS video.  Julie Aigner-Clark is a genius!  Her innovative products, exceptionally creative, are designed to entertain children while they learn.  ""Baby Van Gogh,"" is no exception.  With an imaginative approach, this instantly engaging video teaches colors through cleverly written text, and real world objects, while stimulating auditory senses with classically arranged musical pieces.  My son was immediately mesmerized from the first viewing, two-months old, and remains fascinated to this day, now fourteen months old.
I heard about Baby Einstein products from friends, but did not become interested until I learned of the company's dedication to providing financial support to MANY children's charities such as the Autism Society of America, Ronald McDonald House, The Eden Institute, a leading school for educating autistic children, and a host of other organizations committed to children with special needs.  I now own several Baby Einstein videos and most of the companion books - they are excellent educational tools.
Additional recommendations - ""Baby Shakespeare,"" ""Baby Mozart,"" ""Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals,"" also, Richard Scarry's ""BEST"" videos are excellent for children 1 year and up.",1027987200,53,1319,5.7384615384615385
1356022,5,B00004UD5I,"I got this as a birthday gift for my first daughter, who is now 3, when she was 1. I had already received Baby Mozart from the same friend 3 years ago when my first daughter was born. I totally rejected the whole ""classical"" theme of having to make my child a genius before she can even talk. So I gave my Baby Mozart away without ever watching it, and I shelved my gift of Baby Van Gogh for 2 years. However, after my 2nd daughter was born I was much more open to anything that would entertain my baby, now that I had two to take care of, and decided to pop in Baby Van Gogh and, OH MY GOSH! I couldn't believe it. She was enthralled. She watched the entire thing, barely taking her eyes off the screen. Like another reviewer said, she is less interested in the still pictures than the colorful puppets and toys, but overall she loves it. She gets so excited as soon as she hears the opening song and sees the caterpillar inching across the screen. Whatever she is doing she will stop and turn toward the screen for the show. She's 6 months now and has been watching Baby Van Gogh since about 3 months. I recently repurchased Baby Mozart again and she likes it, too. I also got Baby Shakespeare, although she doesn't like it nearly as much, I think because it has more of the ""real"" pictures. She still loves Baby Van Gogh the best, and it is good every time for a rest for me if I need to take a shower or cook dinner or have free hands to play with my 3 year old, who also enjoys watching the videos with her baby sister, even at her age, although this week she would rather watch Fox & the Hound than anything else. So I would recommend Baby Mozart & Van Gogh. Shakespeare isn't too good for babies and I heard that Bach isn't that good either.",1027123200,7,1748,4.15929203539823
1356023,5,B00004UD5I,"The Baby Einstein products are wonderfully visual videos/DVDs set to classical music with a baby flare... our personal favourite is Baby Van Gogh.
This video is hosted by adorable and humorous Vincent Van Goat. There are 6 masterpieces dedicated to six colours. Each masterpiece is begins with showing the spelling of the colour and the whole set is accompanied with classical music with a flare that will appeal to youngsters. Each colour is narrated with a poem dedicated to that colour. Little viewers see each colour in many contexts - in nature, at home, on toys and art. This highly sensory experience is sure to delight and stimulate any precious mind.
The recommended ages are 1-4 years...",1026172800,,697,4.965811965811966
1356024,5,B00004UD5I,"My son has loved this video since we got it when he was 9 months old.  I just purchased the DVD for the car, in part because I am sure we're going to wear out the video any day now!
The puppets are really cute and amusing.  Yeah, the poetry isn't Shakespeare, but my son smiles through it.  He loves watching the children in this video and I love seeing him laugh out loud at the silliness of it all.",1018569600,,400,3.975
1356025,5,B00004UD5I,"My son has been watching the series from Baby Einstein since he was a few months old.  This one is by far his favorite, and he loves to watch it in the afternoon or evening (it helps to calm him down, great before bedtime or a nap).  He'll clap, ""talk"", and give huge smiles throughout the video.  My wife, an early elementary teacher, was not sure if she wanted our son watching videos at first - but after seeing his joy while watching these videos, she's hooked.  Still, moderation is the key - don't let these tapes/DVDs become babysitters.  Overall, a wonderful selection, and worth 10x the price!",1017100800,3,602,4.537037037037037
1356026,5,B00004UD5I,I have the entire series and my daughter is absolutely fascinated by this one.  She's been watching the Baby Einstein series intently since she was 3 months old and is still captivated at 11 months. Baby VanGogh is quite enjoyable for adults to watch.,1016323200,3,251,4.704545454545454
1356027,4,B00004UD5I,"As an early childhood educator, I've kept an eye on these videos, although we do not use them in our classes. Following the advice on some of the Listmanias, I decided to try a few videos that sounded great.  My new baby girl, Teresa is 9 months old.  She like this video.  It is very colorful, and helpful in getting her to quiet down. The imagery is great, but it really must be used as a platform for mother-led teaching. Of the other videos I checked out from the LIstmania, Teresa and I both loved The Baby Know-It-All series.  Its not as slow as these, and  is a better language tool. We also tried Baby Animals.  My neighbors two year old loved it, but Teresa wasn't interested in it yet.  Bilingual Baby was another choice.  The colors aren't as vivid as in these other series, but its great to have options on language, since we are a bilingual spanish speaking family.
Before I made my choices, however, I did watch a bit of Baby Mozart and Baby Shakespeare in the store.  I found Van Gogh to be the better one, as Mozart doesn't have such great imagery, and Shakespeare's language is too complex for little ears. The Einstein one  is not interesting to me at all, nor to Teresa.
She's quite stuck on Baby Know-It-All right now, she really likes watching the other kids perform, but we still watch Van Gogh toward the evening time, after a very stimulating walk through Uptown Manhattan.",1012348800,8,1397,4.486166007905139

1356029,5,B00004UD5I,"Beautiful, well done video to help children learn their colors.  Our daughter was always fascinated with this video as well as most of the rest of the Baby Einstein series.  She would watch any other videos until she was almost 2!",1006214400,,230,4.585365853658536
1356030,5,B00004UD5I,"This DVD/video is among the best of Baby Einstein's well-produced videos. It has plenty of colorful action for younger children, but also has some appeal for those up to 4 years! It is quite engaging, and the Van Gogh theme is just brilliant. As with other Baby Einstein DVD's, however, the menus are impossible to navigate.",1005177600,2,324,4.803571428571429
1356031,1,B00004UD5I,"Frankly, for the $$ I was unimpressed. I had heard great things about this series and was sorely disappointed. Each of the presentations seem very ""low budget.""  The filming content did not keep the attention of either my child or my nieces or nephews, ages 6 months to 4 yrs.  Next time, I will tape animal/art programs from either Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and play my classical CD's in the back ground.  Save your self the $$.",1004659200,28,438,4.589743589743589

We recently purchased the Baby Doolittle videos and these are great for her age.  The colors, beautiful music, and quick pace of all of the videos are great to keep the attention of an active baby.  They are also great to put on in case mommy needs to take a phone call or even a shower!  I would recommend these to anyone with a baby...they are wonderful and educational.  I can't say enough good things about them...I guess the way I show I love them is to buy the videos for friends and family with infants and toddlers.",1003968000,,687,4.246153846153846

1356034,5,B00004UD5I,"This is the worlds best video for young children.  This is educational it teaches colors.  It also teaches fine art.  Unlike some of the other baby einstein videos it clearly is teaching something.  Adults can stand to sit through this video.  My son is 14 months old and he can watch it 2-3 times in a row.  I have an extremely active child and it is the only thing that gets him to hold still.  Litterally this goes on and from the boot up of the dvd he is glued to the screen.
It has nice extra features like a list of toys.",1000771200,,527,4.058252427184466

1356036,5,B00004UD5I,Baby Van Gogh is very well done. My 8 months old daughter loves it. She started to enjoy this video now. I think Baby Mozart and Baby Bach can be enjoyed by younger babies but Baby Van Gogh is definitely a great video for 7 months and older. Even I enjoy it. It has good and fun music and it teachs colors in a very cute way. The puppets do a very good job on this video! I recommend Baby Van Gogh 100%.,999216000,,403,3.8674698795180724

And after all the kids go home, my grandson wants to watch one again. He goes into our bedroom and he knows how to put the tape into the vcr. He figured it out at 18 months of age, by trial and error. Now at two years, he knows which one by the cover he wants to watch. All the daycare kids are picking things up from the videos. Saying what they see. They all like the music and sound effects. Some of their moms have bought a few of the videos so their child can enjoy them at home with mommy and daddy. Thanks Julie for making learning fun and enjoying at the same time.",999043200,2,739,4.0
1356038,5,B00004UD5I,"Although I bought this DVD for my one year old daughter, at first it was my 4 year old who seemed most captivated by it.  The older requested it (""for the baby"") at least once a day, and the younger has been more intrigued with each repetition.  She recently followed my husband around the house with the DVD remote control until he turned it on for her.  The music and images are pleasant, not in the least annoying for parents who end up viewing and listening repeatedly.  What I like best about this one in the series is how it is broken into segments linking a primary color and a specific work of Van Gogh.  My older daughter instantly recognized Starry Night, which we have in our home, and  Vase with 14 Sunflowers, which she has seen at preschool.  This video/DVD works as a stimulus for mental development, and as an early exposure to classic art.  Kudos to Julie Aigner-Clark -- again!",994550400,6,895,4.481481481481482

Still, this is a great value.",990230400,,376,4.405797101449275
1356040,5,B00004UD5I,"This is one of the best videos for older children in the Baby Einstein series.  Led by a puppet character named Vincent Van Goat, children are introduced to art and colors.  Van Gogh paintings are selected with predominant color themes and then the video shows various items of each respective color, including having all the children dress in the color.  As always, there are puppet skits and toys, only in this presentation, they all follow the color motif.  There are also original poems and arrangements of classical musical pieces.
I highly recommend this video as an addition to your Baby Einstein collection for children two years old and up.  If you don't have a Baby Einstein collection, start one today.  They are wonderful, culturally enriched learning experiences for your child that they can start watching from birth through the toddler years.",983232000,11,857,5.042553191489362
