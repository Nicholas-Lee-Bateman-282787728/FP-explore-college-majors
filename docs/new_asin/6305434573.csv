8587210,5,6305434573,"I purchased all four videos in this series three years ago. I continue to use these videos and I have learned a lot from them!  They contain a lot more than just kata, but the kata are the best part. Also contained on the tapes are warmup exercises, basic technique, bag work, and some sparing.  When combined with the use of the ""Best Karate"" books (volumes 5,6,7,8), the learning of new Kata is relatively easy. The kata are demonstrated once from the front view, in half speed, then a second time at full speed from the front view and then full speed from the side view.
The best ""selling point"" of these videos, is the value.
Volume 1 contains two kata (and a lot of basic technique.)
Volume 2 contains four kata.
Volume 3 contains two kata.
Volume 4 contains four kata.
I wish Instructor Kawasoe would produce videos of some of the black belt katas like Sochin, Unsu, Gojushiho Sho & Kanku Sho.
In summary, if you are looking for help to learn Shotokan kata, I recommend you buy these videos.",1027987200,10,997,4.472527472527473
