8342236,5,B001TOQUGO,"I've given this as a gift to a friend with a daughter who is 9 years old like Syrena in the DVD. She loves it and dances and sings with it daily. The costumes, songs, dance and narration are beautiful and playful but also convey deep perennial truths. There is no other DVD that I know of for kids that celebrates earth-based spirituality. I highly recommend it for children and the young at heart.",1335916800,,398,4.391891891891892
