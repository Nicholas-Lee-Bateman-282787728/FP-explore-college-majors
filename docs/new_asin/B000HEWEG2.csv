2636623,5,B000HEWEG2,"As Sean Connery is the definitive James Bond so goes for Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan.  Now were at RKO Studios and Maureen O'Sullivan has left but Johnny Sheffield stayed on as 'Boy'.

TARZAN TRIUMPHS  1943  Stars our princess Francis Gifford, known by all as JUNGLE GIRL in the Republic serial (1941-see my review).  Cheetah has a great bit at the end. This is probably the best of the RKO series.  Tarzan v.s. NAZIS part one.

TARZAN'S DESERT MYSTERY  1943  Stars Nancy Kelly and Otto Kruger.  It's Tarzan v.s. NAZIS part two.

TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS  1945  Introduces Brenda Joyce as 'Jane' and includes Maria Ouspenskaya (WOLFMAN) as the Amazon Queen.  No more Nazis here.

TARZAN AND THE LEOPARD WOMAN  1946  OK escapism but you can tell all involved are getting weary.

TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS  1947  Probably the weakest entry but....

TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS  1948  The last of the Weissmuller Tarzans.  The stand out here is Linda Christian, ZOWIE !!!!

As a footnote the next was TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN with Lex Barker in 1949 with Brenda Joyce and Evelyn Ankers (WOLFMAN) and a pretty good Tarzan movie--maybe it will kick off the next collection (post Weissmuller Tarzan ???).",1155859200,35,1190,4.85929648241206

Shadows on the backdrop of sets, bad acting, lack of Tarzan's signature props ( many elephants , Apes, Lions, etc) and poor plots made this a big disappointment for me.

2636641,4,B000HEWEG2,"I recently watched Tarzan and the Huntress, and Tarzan and the Amazon Women. They are pretty basic Tarzan flicks. Nothing real special there.

I always got a kick out of the Tarzan movies despite the lack of plot and complete lack of believability.

It is interesting to watch the natives that speak better English than Tarzan wonder around in US style clothing. I always wondered where they were able to buy it out in the jungle.

Don't expect anything beyond what it is.  As Tarzan flicks go, pretty good.",1395014400,,507,4.662921348314606

2636651,5,B000HEWEG2,"Theres nothing like going back to the classics when you have an itch to watch something other than most of the mass produced product, put out on TV and cable these days.  That may make it sound like Im really old, but thats not so, I just enjoy the classics of yesterdays movie era before television even existed.  At one point there was innocence in our movie history that was visually captured and portrayed in a way that todays writers producers and directors just don't vision anymore.  Where Africa was a wild and mysterious faraway place and man had to be strong and adapt or not survive.  These adventures by todays standards leave a lot to be desired technically, but they were state of the art for the day.  I really enjoy Johnny and Maureen most of all in these roles, though many before and after have played Tarzan and Jane, these two had a chemistry that brought a realism to the roles they played.  There here in these collector sets to be enjoyed over and over, if thats your cup of tea I highly recommend them, for when you just want to see something different, I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.",1374278400,,1116,4.393203883495145

2636696,5,B000HEWEG2,"This 1943 film unfortunately takes place in the desert and in an Arab city in Africa, and not in the jungle where Tarzan is king, and Tarzan does not appear as often in the movie as does Boy. This is the eighth of the twelve films in which Johnny Weissmuller appears, the fifth with Boy, and the second where Maureen O'Sullivan is not present as Jane. Hoping to bring O'Sullivan back to the series, a hope which failed, the producers say that Jane is in England treating English soldiers and is unable to return to Tarzan and Boy because of the war. She writes a letter to Tarzan, which is dropped into the jungle by parachute. Tarzan is unable to read, so Boy reads it to him. She requests that Tarzan go and find the medicine that he used to cure Boy in a prior film and send it to her to cure some English soldiers. (We are obviously not supposed to ask how Tarzan can send medicines to England when Jane can't travel to Tarzan.) She explicitly writes that Tarzan should not take Boy on the trip, but since Tarzan can't read and Boy wants to go, he tells Tarzan that Jane said to be sure to take Boy with him.

 While traveling across a desert, Tarzan saves a horse from bad German people. The horse tells Tarzan, who can't read but understands animals, it wants to go with him. When Tarzan reaches an Arab city, these Germans tell the Arabs that Tarzan stole the horse from them and Tarzan is arrested. Tarzan becomes involved in saving the Arabs from the Germans. When Tarzan becomes entrapped in the leaves of a killing flower, he gives the Tarzan yell and, as in prior Tarzan films, elephants come and save him. In another episode, he gives a loud horse whiney and the horse that he saved comes to his rescue.",1306281600,3,1716,4.376175548589342

2636709,5,B000HEWEG2,"As a tail-end boomer this is the stuff that Sunday afternoons were made of!  Everything that captivated me as a child still delivers.  These films are just as fun and silly and animal filled as I remember!  Keep in mind that in the 60s in central Maine I did not get to see animals like that.  There was no zoo; just Wild Kingdom, Wonderful World of Disney, and Tarzan!

I purchased this volume specifically because it included Tarzan and the Amazons.  That was the film that captivated me the most. I just remember being wow-ed by the cliffs Tarzan had to climb to return the wayward Amazon to her people.  Then you had lots of critters, Tarzan wrestling an alligator, bad guys with guns, Amazon women shooting bad guys with arrows, Boy helping the bad (he didn't know!) guys because he was mad at Tarzan.

When I purchase old films I have an open mind as to what quality the video will have.  I'm just excited to be able to get them! Well, these films look way better on my 46"" than they did on our old B&W console, which had an antenna mounted on the roof and a control you could turn to make the antenna rotate to improve reception.

My 19 and 16 year olds are enjoying them also-  ""Boy? Boy??! They just call him BOY??!!""  ;-)

Really, I am enjoying these as much as I hoped I will. If you think you would enjoy them, then you NEED to get them too!",1280966400,2,1353,4.258823529411765
2636710,4,B000HEWEG2,"I bought this set once AMAZON dropped its price to under $20.00.  There are several differences between the first 6 Tarzans (in TARZAN COLLECTION 1) and these last 6 (in TARZAN COLLECTION 2):

1. Set 1 were the 6 that were produced at MGM...Set 2 were produced at RKO.

2. There was stock footage used in some of the films in both sets, but it's more noticeable in Set 2.

3. While there was very little music in the earlier Tarzan Movies, set 2 has Paul Sawtell and Dimitri Tiompkin handling the composition and/or orchestrations.  There's almost too much music in TARZAN & THE MERMAIDS...accounting for the weak story line.  [This could've been the reason Weissmuller stopped making the Tarzan Movies and went on to become JUNGLE JIM].

4. If you've followed Johnny Sheffield from TARZAN FINDS A SON (in set 1), you'll notice that he matures considerably throughout each film in set 2.  Sheffield went on to portray BOMBA, THE JUNGLE BOY in several low budget 50s films.

5. TARZAN & THE AMAZONS (in set #2) introduces us to the new actress who portrays Jane.  Brenda Joyce recreated the role very well.  She continues in the remaining 3 which include TARZAN & THE LEOPARD WOMAN, TARZAN & THE HUNTRESS and TARZAN & THE MERMAIDS. It's very difficult not to enjoy her interplay with Tarzan & Boy  [Joyce went on to write children's books throughout the rest of the 20th century. Sadly, she passed away at the age of 92 in late 2009 due to dementia].

6. Actor Barton Maclane mysteriously shows up in both LEOPARD WOMAN & HUNTRESS...which is a little bizarre since he was killed in the first one.  My guess is that he was a contract player.  If you look closely, there are several actors in the MGM Tarzans (Series 1) that suddenly show up in the RKO Tarzans (Series 2).

If you enjoyed the series growing up...you'll enjoy rewatching them as an adult.  The running time for most of the 6 features is roughly 70 minutes.  And even though all the films are more than 60 years old, they're still entertaining.  [Your welcome, CHETA!],",1279497600,4,2031,4.622905027932961

2636714,5,B000HEWEG2,"Here are some details to help you decide on whether to purchase this better-than-average RKO film set. First, I'll list the six films that you'll get on three DVDs (each of them stars Johnny Weissmuller) and some relevant information about each one:

Tarzan Triumphs (1943, 76 minutes, directed by Wilhelm Thiele) -- The reclusive native residents of the hidden jungle enclave city of Pilandria are peaceful sun worshippers -- but not for long. The Nazis need their geological resources and one of the dastardly devils has accidentally discovered the secret location, returning with his goose-stepping pals. Jane has written to Tarzan about the war and how evil the Nazis are but the ape-man is not inclined to get involved in the conflict until they kidnap Boy (Johnny Sheffield). After that, it's all bad for the lamentable Nazis when Tarzan shouts, ""NOW Tarzan make war!!!"" This is a marvellous film and there are some notable supporting actors, such as Frances Gifford&nbsp;], who make it all that much better.

Tarzan's Desert Mystery (1943, 70 minutes, directed by Wilhelm Thiele) -- World War II is on: Jane is away from the jungle (we never see her in this one) and she writes Tarzan to ship her some ""jungle medicine"" (from an obscure jungle region where prehistoric creatures exist) to cure allied soldiers whom have contracted a devastating fever in Burma. Through a comedy of errors and due to evil adversaries, Tarzan gets tossed into the clink of an Arab village. Cheetah the chimpanzee is a key figure in this one and the vain efforts at slapstick comedy do not benefit the film. Boy is played by Johnny Sheffield and Otto Kruger&nbsp;] co-stars. There are some splendid aspects to this movie (such as the dinosaurs) but overall, it's not one of the better Tarzan entries.

Tarzan and the Amazons (1945, 76 minutes, directed by Kurt Neumann) -- Tarzan rescues a native girl from Palmyria, a secret jungle city where women dominate the society and where the worship of a sun god predominates the culture. Jane (Brenda Joyce) returns to the jungle after an extended trip back to civilization -- she brings along some archaeologist friends who quickly pick up on the rumors of the immense Palmyrian treasures. Tarzan adamantly disapproves of the expedition's efforts to attempt to locate the secret enclave but Boy (Johnny Sheffield) helps them out in a period of dull-wittedness. Maria Ouspenskaya&nbsp;] stars as the Amazon Queen. This is an outstanding film.

Tarzan and the Leopard Woman (1946, 72 minutes, directed by Kurt Neumann) -- The title is a little misleading -- it's chiefly the leopard MEN who do all the damage and their High Priestess (Acquanetta, who also starred in ""Jungle Woman"" in 1944) mostly just co-conspires with a male spy to achieve her end of keeping civilization from overwhelming her jungle realm. It's a good story and one which gives rise to a relevant question today: Should we go into remote regions of the planet and ""civilize"" the indigenous people? The answer was doubtless different in 1946 than it is now. Brenda Joyce plays Jane and Johnny Sheffield co-stars as Boy. We get a bonus of perfect casting with Dennis Hoey&nbsp;] appearing as the Regional Commissioner. I really like this one with all the terrific stereotypical sets including an Arab market (in the fictional city of Zambesi), snake charming, colonial soldiers, and so on.

Tarzan and the Huntress (1947, 72 minutes, directed by Kurt Neumann) -- A benevolent King of a jungle city has an evil and corrupt nephew who lends a hand to animal trappers in exceeding the King's quota on the number of animals they're permitted to capture. Tarzan wants NO animals taken from his jungle paradise but he's willing to tolerate the King's ruling of only a pair of each species (perhaps a Biblical metaphor) until the expedition members begin to grab all the critters they can capture. This movie is your essential ""Tarzan good, all explorers evil"" scenario, (which is basically also true in real life!) The weakness of the film is its obvious predictability coupled with all the ""Caucasian natives"" one encounters in this one. Brenda Joyce stars as Jane, Johnny Sheffield as Boy, and Charles Trowbridge&nbsp;] as King Farrod. This is a middle-of-the-road movie in general terms, certainly ranking among the cream of all the classic Tarzan films.

Tarzan and the Mermaids (1948, 68 minutes, directed by Robert Florey) -- This is the only stinker in the barrel, even though it co-stars one of my favorite actors of all time, the venerable George Zucco&nbsp;] as the evil High Priest. RKO Pictures brought out the big guns on this production including Dimitri Tiomkin who composed and conducted the original musical score; however, it was all to no avail. A weak feature of the movie hits us right off as a narrator rambles on to explain the set-up of the story. Essentially, two evil men dominate a peaceful commune of natives -- the residents have to constantly dive for pearls to satiate the treasure lust of their dark god, Balu (who is actually one of the nefarious twosome dressed up in a goofy costume.) Brenda Joyce appears as Jane but Boy (said to be away at school) does not appear in this one. A notable morsel of trivia, Johnny Weissmuller's stunt double, &Aacute;ngel Garc&iacute;a, was killed while performing the famous cliff dive into the ocean at Acapulco, Mexico which was one of the filming locations. While there are many good elements to the movie, (such as the underwater ""fish tank"" shots), these positive features simply do not ultimately give rise to an endearing end-production. The singer-poet, Benji, (played by John Laurenz) makes it all the more grueling as he articulates his romantic jungle librettos.

2636742,3,B000HEWEG2,"THE TARZAN COLLECTION, Vol 2. continues the filmed saga of Edgar Rice Burroughs enduring White Ape-Man.  Vol 1. featured the films produced at M.G.M.  With World War II valuable overseas markets were lost and the M.G.M. style of Tarzan with Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan were no longer the money maker it was.  Solution, producer Sol Lesser got TARZAN's Weissmuller to move over to RKO and bring production too a new series of jungle adventure.

There were changes though, RKO was not M.G.M.  This was reflected in both budgets and running time.  While the M.G.M. films were 'A' pictures, RKOs' efforts were 'Bs'.  This reflected not only in these films but RKOs' declining status from one of the majors too the middle tier with COLUMBIA, REPUBLIC and UNIVERSAL.

These TARZANs' though are well worth watching and are excellent 'popcorn' fare for a rainy days entertainment.  Johnny Sheffield was back as 'BOY' for five (5) of the six (6) features and Brenda Joyce as a stunning 'JANE' for the last four (4).  Lots of recognizable character actors filled out each films roster.  The prints struck are in good shape, but did not receive full restoration and are not of the same quality as Vol 1.  Nor is there much in the way of special features in this set.

2636760,5,B000HEWEG2,"When it comes to clearing the path for major Olympic athletes to strike gold in pop culture, Johnny Weissmuller is the leader.

Weissmuller earned 52 U.S. national swimming titles, while setting an incredible 67 world records and winning a total of five gold medals - and one bronze - in The Games of 1924 and 1928. He became the sixth cinematic Tarzan and starred in a dozen films.

The six films in the second volume of the boxed-set retrospectives are Weissmuller's RKO performances from 1943-1948. The action adventures initially carry themes for the war years - Nazi soldiers as the bad guys - but then revert back to the exploitive explorers and traditional evil-doers.

With his natural athleticism, Weissmuller as Tarzan always pulls out victory when it seems that doom will finally triumph. But getting to those final scenes is all the fun.",1218672000,,849,4.923076923076923
2636761,3,B000HEWEG2,"Although there have been plenty of other versions of the character, probably the classic movie version of Tarzan is Johnny Weismuller's portrayal in a dozen movies in the 1930s and `40s.  The first six of these films were made by MGM (and are in a different set); RKO took over the franchise then and made the final six.

If you watch all twelve films, you can easily see differences between the two sets.  Most notably, the MGM films had Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane.  In the first two RKO films, Jane is in Europe while Tarzan contends with Nazis, and in the last four, Jane is played by the good-looking but clearly second-string actress, Brenda Joyce.  Gone in the second set is Tarzan's famous yell; all we get is a lesser imitation.  The later movies often have Tarzan, Jane and Boy seeming like a jungle version of the Cleavers or the Nelsons.  The films aren't bad, but let's face it, compared to the MGM films, they're second-rate.

On the first of the three discs are Tarzan Triumphs and Tarzan's Desert Mystery.  In Tarzan Triumphs, Tarzan reluctantly gets involved in WWII when Nazis take over a hidden city.  (There are lots of hidden cities in this set, and though all these movies take place in Africa, there is an amazingly small number of Africans.)  Due to a flaw on my DVD, I couldn't view Tarzan's Desert Mystery, but my understanding is it's a second WWII flick.

When Jane returns in Tarzan and the Amazons (on disc two), she doesn't do too much.  Instead, it's up to Tarzan to save a lost kingdom of Amazonian women from greedy treasure hunters who learn of them from Boy.  Tarzan and the Leopard Woman is somewhat unique in that the villains are not motivated by greed or power as much as they just want to get rid of British colonizers.

The final disc has Tarzan and the Huntress, the last movie with Tarzan, Jane and Boy; by this point, Boy is almost an adult himself and by the next movie, he'll be off in England for school.  The huntress in this story is the head of an expedition to capture animals for zoos.  While she is relatively decent, her companions are more ruthless.  Tarzan and the Mermaids is a forgettable finale, with Tarzan helping expose a false god in a beach community.

With no extras to speak of, this set has to succeed on the merits of the films themselves, and while they are mostly fun and inoffensive, they are also strictly average fare, so I have to give this set three stars.  With plenty of antics by Cheetah and relatively tame levels of violence, this set probably would appeal more to kids than adults.",1218326400,10,2562,4.540305010893246

2636806,4,B000HEWEG2,"As a child watching Johnny Weissmuller in old Tarzan movies on television, I made few distinctions between the MGM series and the RKO.  Now I see that the RKO Tarzan films lacked the MGM gloss (and Maureen O'Sullivan).  Still, they have their points of interest.  Between TARZAN TRIUMPHS (1943) and TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS (1948), Brenda Joyce comes on board as the new Jane, Weissmuller's waist thickens, Johnny Sheffield's voice changes, and movie-Africa seems less and less like movie-Africa as black faces are replaced by white and Latino ones made up to resemble, I dunno, Indonesians -- until at last the place suddenly turns into Mexico, complete with cliff-divers and Aztec temple.  Don't think I'm complaining, however.  The flicks are fun (why, that incongruous Aztec temple is presided over by no less sinister a fellow than George Zucco!), the gals look fine, and the Nazi villains in TARZAN TRIUMPHS naturally don't stand a chance once the Ape Man utters my favorite Ape Man line of all, ""Now Tarzan make war!""",1164153600,8,1023,4.9941176470588236
2636807,4,B000HEWEG2,"The Tarzan Collection Volume 1 featured the classic Johnny Weismuller Tarzan films made at MGM between 1932 and 1942. Volume 2 completes the Weismuller era with the six Tarzan films he made at RKO before hanging up his loincloth in 1948, the same year he began playing Jungle Jim for low-budget producer Sam Katzman. Not as impressive as volume 1 which boasted the more spectacular MGM films and some really nice extras, this one is very bare bones without so much as a trailer added.

The first and best film in the set is TARZAN TRIUMPHS with isolationist Tarzan experiencing his own Pearl Harbor when Nazis kidnap Boy and speaking the classic line, ""Now, Tarzan make war!"". The picture quality on this one is absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately, the print quality varies on the rest of the films. The original elements for most of these must be long gone and , while I assume WB did their best to provide the highest quality copies they could find, the image quality some of the films is disappointing. The first reel of TARZAN'S DESERT MYSTERY looks rather poor, but the remainder of the movie came from a much sharper print.  although it dose have a lot of dust and scratches that are a little distracting. TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS looks very good throughout but the image quality of the remaining three films (TARZAN AND THE LEOPARD WOMAN, TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS and TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS) isn't up to the first three on the set. Some are rather dull-looking or have too much contrast. HUNTRESS looks especially bad.

While I wish all the films in this set could have been presented using top-notch original materials, it's still good to finally have all the Weismuller Trazans on DVD. Growing up in the 1960s when they were on TV every Saturday, these Tarzan movies were a big part of my childhood. Johnny Weismuller was the definative screen Tarzan and is still good in the later films, even though he was looking very middle-aged by the end of his run. Even that seemed to fit, though, since Boy had grown into a teenager and part of the plots usually delt with family relationships. Over the years Weismuller's Tarzan evolved from a sexy young savage to a father figure and protector.

I'd give the set 5 stars for the films, but the the lack of bonus material and the below-par quality of some of the prints knocked it down to 4. Your enjoyment of the series will probably depend on your age and whether or not you are a fan of this type of escapist adventure, but to me, these are very important films and I love having them in my collection.",1162512000,9,2555,4.608791208791208
2636808,4,B000HEWEG2,"Weissmuller really set the bar in portraying Tarzan, the noble savage.  He developed the yell and no one has come close to portraying a better jungle man except for Brendan Frasier's George of the Jungle, but that's another story.  I used to watch the movies in the afternoons, when they showed old movies.  It's really cool to see them releasing these films.",1161993600,6,359,4.758064516129032
2636809,4,B000HEWEG2,"While Tarzan was a moneymaker at MGM, with the outset of WWII, the studio felt Johnny Weissmuller was getting too old, Maureen O'Sullivan wanted out of the series, and the overseas market was lost, so the series was dropped...but RKO would prove the Ape Man had a LOT of life left in him!

Producer Sol Lesser loved the character, and snapped up the rights, wisely keeping Weissmuller, 39, and 'Boy' Johnny Sheffield, at nearly 12, in their signature roles. 'Jane' was written out of the first two features (first caring for her mother, then serving in the war), and the best-loved elements (superhuman heroics, comedy from chimp co-star, Cheetah, wild animal footage) were 'beefed up', dropping the romance, the atmospheric black 'extras', that provided authenticity (but were expensive for a smaller studio to maintain), and the MGM 'glossiness'. Even the Tarzan 'yell' had to be replaced (as the manufactured howl, part Weismuller, part studio magic), was the property of the studio; Weismuller created a 'new' one, that would become so popular that it would be kept, long after he finally retired from the role.

The first RKO entry was perhaps the best of the series; TARZAN TRIUMPHS brought the Nazis into the jungle to tap the resources of a 'lost' city, kidnapping Boy, and leading the previously isolationist Ape Man to utter the famous tag line, ""Now Tarzan make war!"" With lovely Frances Gifford as a native princess, and Sig Ruman, moving from Marx Brothers' foil to one of Hollywood's busiest 'Nazis', as one of the villains, the film is very entertaining (if extremely violent...Tarzan encourages the locals to grab a gun and kill, Boy shoots one Nazi soldier with a pistol, and even CHEETA machine guns one!).

TARZAN'S DESERT MYSTERY again offered Nazis (Otto Kruger, who'd played a similar role in Hitchcock's SABOTEUR, a year earlier, and veteran screen baddie Joe Sawyer), an American girl magician (vivacious Nancy Kelly), and a chance to combine Nazi duplicity with an 'Arabian'-themed adventure (which was a popular genre during the war years). Even a fantasy element was tossed in, as giant lizards and a mechanical spider 'passing' as 'prehistoric' appear in a 'lost jungle' climax.

TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS is closest in 'style' to the earlier MGM 'Tarzan' films (offering a crocodile fight, a 'classic' safari with many more black extras than in any other RKO 'Tarzan' feature of the era, excellent production values), and is most famous for introducing American Brenda Joyce, 33, as the new 'Jane', back from the war. Blond and beautiful, she lacked O'Sullivan's intellectual 'spin' to the role, but worked well with the 41-year-old Weissmuller, while providing a mother figure for 'Boy' that the 'kid' audience could relate to. With a cast of terrific character actors (including Henry Stephenson, Maria Ouspenskaya, and Barton MacLane), and a plot involving a 'lost' city of women, the film is one of the best-remembered RKO entries, and great fun!

TARZAN AND THE LEOPARD WOMAN marked the beginning of the decline of the RKO series; a routine, even silly tale of a cult (dressed in cheesy leopard skins) and it's high priestess (buxom Acquanetta) terrorizing the local population, and capturing Tarzan and his family. Memorable only for Cheeta saving Tarzan, yet again, and seeing 'Boy' Johnny Sheffield in the midst of puberty...

TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS suffers from a low budget and a ho-hum plot; entrepreneur Patricia Morison's greedy crew kill a 'lost city' king to exceed their animal 'quota' for zoos, bringing out an aging Tarzan and startlingly adult-looking Boy; this would mark Sheffield's last appearance in the role.

TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, Weissmuller's final Tarzan appearance, is a truly surreal entry; filmed in Mexico, with musical interludes, the plot features an Aztec temple complete with a 'god', and cliff-diving (in AFRICA???), and is best remembered for lovely Linda Christian (Tyrone Power's future bride), as a runaway native girl, and a musical score by legendary Dimitri Tiomkin. Weissmuller looks middle-aged and heavy, and would be replaced, in the next film, by young Lex Barker.

A mixed bag, to be sure, but great fun, at it's best, and certainly worth owning!",1161302400,45,4226,5.123367198838897

2636811,4,B000HEWEG2,"I have been waiting a long time for some of the wonderful Tarzan films in this collection. My guess is that most people believe that the Tarzan films from MGM are superior to those released in the 1940s by RKO. I may be in the minority, but to me the RKO Tarzan films were a lot more fun. Johnny Weissmuller was still on hand, as well as Johnny Sheffield as Boy. Tarzan Triumphs (1943) with Frances Gifford, has Tarzan up against the Nazi's and is highly entertaining. Tarzan's Desert Mystery (1943) is great over-the-top fun as Tarzan, once again, deals with Nazi's and some giant monsters and devouring plants. My two very favorites are Tarzan And The Amazons (1945) with Maria Ouspenskaya as the diminutive Queen of the Amazon women and Tarzan And The Leopard Woman (1946) with Aquanetta. At this time, the very likeable Brenda Joyce had joined the cast as Jane and does an admirable job in the role. The two lesser efforts complete the collection: Tarzan And The Huntress (1947) and Tarzan And The Mermaids (1948). If you enjoyed the first box set, this set will not disappoint!",1156809600,36,1082,4.670157068062827
2636812,4,B000HEWEG2,"I'm very glad to see these movies finally being released on DVD. I have fond childhood memories of watching these movies on a local channel every Sunday morning. While these films aren't quite as good as the MGM series they are still exciting, entertaining movies.

Here's hoping they'll continue with the Lex Barker and Gordon Scott (my personal favorites) movies. I'd be happy to see Jock Mahoney and Mike Henry too.",1156636800,17,418,4.887323943661972
2636813,5,B000HEWEG2,The 5 stars are gratitude for the release. This is for Johnny Weismuller fans. The stories here are less well made than the original 6 MGM movies but there has never been a better Tarzan than Weismuller and that alone justifies buying this. If you like Tarzan then this belongs in your collection.,1156204800,18,297,4.622641509433962
8139268,4,B000HEWEG2,"Why in the world does this set cost $186???

That is ridiculous.  MGM needs to reissue these at a reasonable price with a healthy package of extras to round out the set.

Give Johnny & Maureen the treatment they deserve.

Give us a package we will be proud to own.",1521331200,,264,4.22

The movies in these series actually have Jane and Boy in the theme whether they are present in the films as he ages in the jungle with his family.",1501804800,,318,4.696428571428571

8139275,3,B000HEWEG2,Watched the first two DVD's in this collection and everything was fine...recently watched the third one and it skipped quite a bit and gave an error message of sorts .. after backing it up a few times it finally played.  That is all we have completed in this Collection so it's unfair to grade it but Amazon is asking for our rating.,1461542400,,333,4.370967741935484
