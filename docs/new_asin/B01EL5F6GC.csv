7738246,2,B01EL5F6GC,"As a HxH fan, I was surprised and excited when I heard there was a movie involving my favorite group of villains (The Phantom Troupe) along with a back story to one of the previous members of the organization who was missing from the series (Omokage) and Kurpitika's clan!.  I figured this movie would be full of action and provide an intriguing backstory to one of my favorite series.

Unfortunately what I got was an incredibly boring story with little action and a conclusion that resulted in little closure.  Omokage doesn't get a very detailed back story, other than he is an ex-member of the Troupe, and left because he created puppets of them?  He then... steals eyes from Kurapika and Gon because the puppets are blind until he gives them sight, which is how the movie opens.

I have a few questions about this though such as why he didn't just get eyes from homeless people and orphans is beyond me.  At first I thought perhaps he needed the eyes of the person he's creating the puppet of, but clearly he has almost the entire cast of the Troupe in puppet form (without their eyes) so one would only question what the entire condition of his powers are, other than to drive the plot.

So Killuah and Gon search the city to try and uncover Omokage's where abouts, when they end up meeting a street performing kid, who is also a puppeteer.  Long story short, they find out that person is actually Omokage's little sister (how convenient!), and end up following her back to his lair, where the conclusion of the movie takes place.  The final battle includes a guest appearance from the Phantom Troupe themselves, to battle none of that themselves in puppet form!  Hisoka kicks some ass as well, but all in all, it's a pretty boring film and doesn't really add anything at all to the original story line.

This could have been a few extra episodes in the Yorknew City arc (this takes place right after it and before Greed Island), and would have fit in much better than being a separate entry.",1505347200,4,1998,4.553072625698324

8759113,5,B01EL5F6GC,"This arrived right on time and in perfect condition. The movies length is a little longer than the average OVA, allowing for a more in depth story to be played out (which is a positive). The story is set just after the York New Arc, and is derived from what Togashi originally wanted to do after said arc. I was pleasantly surprised with how well the story was done (given the limit in length) and would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of HxH!!",1522627200,,461,4.310344827586207
