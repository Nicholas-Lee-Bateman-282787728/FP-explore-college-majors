""I have had the pleasure of knowing Melanie as a teacher for many years.
She is inspirational and genuine. This video is a must watch and her voice is so soothing and calm. Her cues are excellent and I am grateful for her teachings.""",1507507200,,251,4.361702127659575
8750716,5,B01BMTV29A,"I received this as a gift...at the very time I was wanting to practice yoga but classes never fit my work schedule. Melanie has  created the most beautiful, soothing yoga practice --all set in the beauty of the mountains of Utah.  Between the music, her voice, and following her instructions, within 7 minutes I felt calm,relaxed and centered.  What a gift.  Thank you so much!",1462320000,,377,4.753846153846154
