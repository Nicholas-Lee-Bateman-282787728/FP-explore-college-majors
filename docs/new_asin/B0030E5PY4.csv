4044765,1,B0030E5PY4,"Shouldn't they wait til they actually win something before releasing their greatest games video? If they don't win the Super Bowl, Saints fans will look at these games as just a tease, and everyone else will just laugh at it. Kinda like the video the Mets released about their 2006 season.",1262217600,,289,4.686274509803922
4044786,5,B0030E5PY4,Whodat?!  Need I say more? I love watching all the close games of the regular season of 2009.  It was a great year for the Saints!,1394928000,,130,3.9615384615384617

4044788,5,B0030E5PY4,"This is the perfect thing to get a Saints fan through the off-season.  The games aren't in their entirety, but pretty darn close.  It seems a few insignificant things are edited out.
Wish it was a Blu-ray, but still looks fair upconverted.",1379462400,,239,4.666666666666667

4044790,5,B0030E5PY4,"I love this collection. As a Saints fan since 1978 (attended every home game from the age of 4 until I moved to Lafayette in 2004), I have watched these games multiple times to relive the magical 2009 saints season. I attended all of the home games and the Superbowl with my 7 year old son & we both enjoy these videos.",1315785600,,319,4.161290322580645

4044793,5,B0030E5PY4,"As a proud member of the Who Dat Nation I get chills and goosebumps each times I watch these DVDs. We waited a long, long time to be able to say ""New Orleans Saints: Super Bowl Champions"" and I hope it won't be long until we're able to say ""New Orleans Saints: Two-time Super Bowl Champions.""",1297900800,,292,4.232142857142857
4044794,4,B0030E5PY4,"I thought this would be a recap of highlights from throughout the season but instead it is the edited broadcast versions of three games (vs. the Dolphins, Patriots, and Falcons).  It's worth the price especially for Saints fans wanting to remember every moment of the 2009 season, and anyone else who wants to watch some great football.",1279843200,,336,4.894736842105263
4044795,5,B0030E5PY4,"Great, it's a must for every fan. Although is a pity not having this one on blu-ray format. Great games for a team of destiny. You'll enjoy very much watching them, that's for sure.",1278288000,,181,4.352941176470588
4044806,4,B0030E5PY4,"Maybe I'm just spoiled by DVDs, but I was quite surprised to discover that the video on these discs is 480i (interlaced) rather than the 480p (progressive) that is typical for DVDs. In other words, this is the standard-definition broadcast recorded to DVD. The video format is listed as ""NTSC"" (i.e., the 480i broadcast standard) on this product page, but it's easy to overlook.

All in all, I'm glad to have these games preserved in full for posterity, and I'd still have bought the DVDs had I realized beforehand. Still, it's disappointing that I can't get these games at a higher resolution (through EITHER downscaling of the original HD broadcast to 480p OR the same games made available on Blu-Ray).",1277164800,,704,4.866666666666666
4044807,5,B0030E5PY4,"The DVD's were perfect.  The videos were clear.  At one point it looked live, the picture was so good.  I didn't realize how short a game really was until I saw these three games without the commercials.  It was wonderful.  Thank you.",1271462400,,234,4.476190476190476

4044810,3,B0030E5PY4,"I am thrilled with the choice of the games (Patriots,Dolphins, Falcons).  Watching the games again helped me relive this great season.  However, the quality of the DVDs was not the best.  On each of them, there are parts where there is no sound.  There is a disclaimer that the quality is based on the original broadcast, but I'm pretty sure there was sound!  It isn't poor enough to mail it back.  I would have loved a copy of the Redskins' game as well.",1269561600,,455,4.421686746987952
4044811,4,B0030E5PY4,"I've only watched the Saints big comeback win against Miami so far.  The video was well-edited and the picture quality was good (certainly better than my VCR recordings).  My only semi-complaint is the description provided on this site -- one of the DVDs shows the Saints victory over the Patriots...not the Eagles.  I had already seen the Patriots game but not the Eagles game, so I was somewhat disappointed.  But the victory over the Patriots was certainly a classic -- and Brees was nearly perfect -- so I'm very glad to have it.",1268611200,,533,4.698924731182796
4044812,3,B0030E5PY4,"As a sports fan from a country outside North America, with an interest in New Orleans Saints, I decided to purchase this set.
I hadn't seen these particular games, therefore I was keen to watch them in full.
I must say, first up, I have purchased an NFL DVD before and the quality, detail & presention was first class.
Unfortunately, as others have stated, this is not completely true for these discs.  Since the games would have originally been shown in high definition, a High Definition quality picture should have been mandatory. The Post Game Show (for each game) would have been a welcome, informative addition to this set.",1268265600,,629,4.770642201834862
4044813,4,B0030E5PY4,"I'd like to say that I'm glad to see the NFL starting to release DVDs of entire NFL games.  I hope to see more of this in the future.  I won't go into any of the technical aspects of the set.  It's basically a three disc set that contains three games from the Saints 2009 season.  Maybe my one disappointment is that I would have preferred the game against the Redskins over the Falcons game included, but that's a personal preference.  If I asked everyone writing a review which three games they would like to have seen in this set, I would have gotten many answers, so just look at this as a great way to celebrate the best season in Saints history.",1267920000,,651,4.260162601626016
4044814,3,B0030E5PY4,"I have nothing negative to say about the content.  The presentation could be better.

1) It's in 4 x 3 aspect ratio.  No excuse for that.
2) Each quarter is a chapter.  That's it.  It would have been logical to place chapter markings at every commercial break, or even arbitrarily... every few minutes.

With all the resources available to NFL films, these two minor gripes should not have even been a second thought.

A nice addition, though perhaps unreasonable to expect, would have been to include some added footage of the players and coaches mic'ed up on the sidelines.  Inside the NFL did this for their Super Bowl 44 special, and it adds a great touch to the game.",1267228800,,672,4.588235294117647
4044815,3,B0030E5PY4,"I have Saints Season Tickets and actually attended the New England and Atlanta Games.  It is great to see the games again as they led to the Super Bowl victory.  The 3 stars is because the games are not in HiDef as they were on broadcast TV. I know it can be done, because the Florida BCS championship DVDs that I have are in ""widescreen"".  That being said, it was a wonderful season and I love having these games as a souvenir.  WHO DAT!!",1265673600,8,439,4.190476190476191

8385823,5,B0030E5PY4,"The New Orleans Saints accomplished a milestone in 2009/2010, achieving a post season birth and winning the Super Bowl. Before the post season comes the regular season and the NFL's version of their best games of the regular season. I'm a relatively new fan and it was such a rush to see such great games during a fantastic run by the Saints. In this 3 Disc set, these are the following games:
Disc 1: Home Game vs. New England Patriots 11/30/2009
Disc 2: @ Miami Dolphins  10/25/2009
Disc 3: Home Game vs. Atlanta Falcons
For the fan of the Saints this is a near perfect way to relive such a great season. You get a comeback victory, a blowout against an elite opponent (and a perfect passer rating by Drew Brees) , and a shootout against a Division rival. I won't ruin the game with the scores because before I got this I haven't seen any of these games. This is a good deal with great sound and visual quality and cutting commercials while showing replays of specific plays. NFL Films did a really good job with this set. Recommended.",1407110400,,1037,4.457894736842105
