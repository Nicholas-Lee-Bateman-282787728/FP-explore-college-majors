8158342,4,B000KN9F7G,Shimmer 2 Was Good. The 4 Way Match Was The Best match of Them All. Fake or no Fake It Gets All kinds of credit.,1397865600,,112,3.52
8158343,1,B000KN9F7G,"Very few matches, It also was more like watching a soft porn movie. If you want to watch half clothe women pretend to wrestle, than invest in this dvd. Otherwise, I would not recommend it.",1362441600,2,188,4.4
8158344,4,B000KN9F7G,"the only reason i bought this dvd is becuase the womens extreme wrestler on the dvd set i looove name THAI is on the cover and the number one reason i love this disc.

if you want real unscripted no glitz no glamour no bull wrestling then i very strong;ly suggest looking up wew wrestling on you search engine. heck even ex-wwe wrestler JAZZ works for this company(also impact wrestling velvet sky,tracy brooks,
ODB(no longer),jackie(no longer),daffney(aka lucy furr)(no loneger),roxxi,and even
rocka chane(SIC)(aka black barbie) are all current and some former wew talent.

i have never owned and never will own any dvd by wwe or tna/impact and mostly
because wew doesn't invest much in advertising and further more i love wrestling
that is stripped down to its bare integrity

my favorite wew talent *1. THAI killer weed(absolutely)
  2.lady storm
  3.pryme tyme amy lee(the biker)
  4.principle lazaras/P@%!Y willow
  5. G.I ho
  6.lexas laree(micky james) ex wwe now impact!
  7.commissioner smoke
  8.annie social
  9.lucy furr
  10.kristy kiss
  11.barroom barbie
  12.psycho bytch
and a whole slew of other womens wrestlers whom are too smart to work for now
triple HHH or the caustic bischoff/hogan/jarrett/flair impact.

now that vince macmahon has been ""relieved of his duties"" FIRED!!!!!!
i can now take wwe monday night raw and friday night smackdown in a little easier
so long vicki and chavo gurrero stays disappeeared. i even see them for a split second and i change channels for the night.

i do the same thing to impact. i even see flair and/or karen and/or jeff jarrett for a split aecond and i shut it off for the night.",1311552000,,1639,4.974074074074074
8158345,5,B000KN9F7G,"There is nothing like watchin hot, badly trained exotic dancers beating the poop out of each other.  A nice little bit of nudity.  I personally recomend it.",1300579200,,156,4.7407407407407405
8158346,3,B000KN9F7G,"Yeah, I love womens wrestling. I like wwe and all the matches, but its not enough of the ladies getting down. Thankfully, there is Amazon dot com and a wonderfull dvd selection. I got this one for Beth Pheonix. She is nice in this one, but she doesn't have the same persona as she does today. She is built, but she ain't so bad. Her match was interresting to see how she started. The rest of the dvd I haven't even watched all of it. It looks cheap like home movie style and dated. If your a real fan You may enjoy this ""vintage material"". If your used to wwe style of fire works, music intros, huh ... an audience, you ain't getting that on this one.",1215043200,,651,4.133858267716535
