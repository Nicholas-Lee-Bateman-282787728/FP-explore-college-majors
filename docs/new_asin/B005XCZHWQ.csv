4903218,3,B005XCZHWQ,"Lash was really not one of my favorites growing up. Being a Rancher and
Horsemen all of my life. I knew at an early age. Who could ride a horse
and who could not. The Lash was definitely one of those who could not.

When ever you have to grasp the saddle Horn with a death grip of the off
rein hand. You can not ride.

This really turned me away from this New Jersey actor playing a cowboy.",1380067200,,390,3.9240506329113924
