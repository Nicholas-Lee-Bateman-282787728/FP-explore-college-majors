8017464,4,B0001X6NHU,"This tape is helpful as an addition to Miriam Nelson's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strong-Women-Stay-Young/dp/0553588737/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strong Women Stay Young</a>. The StrongWomen program consists of eight exercises & is aimed at women in mid-life & beyond.  Because the exercises are classics (knee extension, hamstring curl, upward row, biceps curl, overhead press), this program would work for most people regardless of age or sex.  The book has excellent illustrations, & the clearest instructions of any strength training book I've come across. But it wasn't until I did the exercises along with the videotape that I really ""got it.""  And unlike those ""Thirty Days to Thinner Thighs"" books that they sell at the supermarket checkout counter, this program is research-based. (Tufts University studied the program & measured its effectiveness.)

PPOS:
You can see what the proper technique looks like.
Helps you learn to do it at the correct speed, which is really SLOW.
Provides a lot of tips, for example, how do you know if your weights are too light?
It helps with motivation.  Let's face it; strength training can be boring, especially if you are doing it at the recommended speed of 8 seconds per rep.
The personal trainer who instructs the class is pleasant & encouraging.

CONS:
The tape was made in 1998, and the program has been revised quite a bit since then.
It doesn't include hamstring curl & bent forward fly which are part of the updated program.
Instead, it has a somewhat awkward hip extension & classic upward row (which I prefer to the bent forward fly)
The stretches are too ""dance-y.""
You have to have a VCR to view it

Bottom Line:  The tape is very helpful, but it would be nice if Miriam Nelson produced an updated DVD of the basic StrongWomen Stay Young program.",1289001600,17,1857,5.228956228956229
8017465,5,B0001X6NHU,"Great tape if you want something to work on balance and a little strength training. Not a vigous workout, but great for women over 50 who want something they can do in their homes. Several friends get together and we do it as a group. It keeps you from going to fast which is what we tend to do without the tape.",1237593600,10,312,4.048387096774194
