3535645,5,B001DPHDCE,"This Disney classic was based on the novel ""Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh"" written by Russell Thorndike and premiered on the TV Show World of Disney in 1963.  This three part series was later edited as a movie and released theatrically six years later.  Both the original three part series as well as the theatrical movie are included here.

Essentially an updated Robin Hood style tale set in the 1700s it's a great family movie.  While it is a bit dated now compared to other swashbuckling summer blockbusters (after all, it was made for TV originally) it offers a simple moral story and excellent acting, especially by Patrick McGoohan, who plays the title role.

I loved this show as a kid, and it's well worth revisiting, young and old.",1217980800,65,750,4.651515151515151

This DVD set includes all three of the original TV episodes plus the theatrical version of the film that was released in England.

3535671,5,B001DPHDCE,"I was thrilled to finally get my hands on this golden memory from my childhood. Walt Disney could always be depended upon for first rate entertainment. Most kids today only know Disney animation but the action adventure classics are what i remember most fondly. ""Scarecrow"" was difficult to find but worth the search. Some very prominent British character actors are featured such as Sean Scully, Michael Hordern! And Geoffrey Keen.  After 50 years, it has lost none of its suspenseful punch and i still cannot resist singing along with that wonderfully catchy theme song.

3535674,1,B001DPHDCE,"I will give this 1 star only because of the ridiculous price these sell for .
Although I thoroughly enjoyed this in as a kid ,there is no amount of  wistful nostalgia left on the face on the earth to make me plunk down $195-$399 for this dvd ....are you kidding me ????!
 I absolutely do not care if Disney released this in limited quantities making this "" rare oop  dvd release !"" .  Yeah yeah I know "" ...well supply and demand Blah blablahblah ' capitalism  ,,blahblah blah free market Blablablah -- take the ' ""gougenonmics-101""  somewhere else ,I do not care !

  If you are just a fan, loved this Disney flick like I did back in the 60s, avoid the price gouging, do yourself a huge favor and spend some time looking for this at yard-sales, thrift stores etc .
 I found this same set at a block yard sale & they wanted $10 --I paid them $35.00, approx retail price in 2008.  They thought I was nuts for overpaying , and I may be, but I know that I am not nuts enough to pay scalpers' prices !  If this dvd was on the shelf at your local Walmart it would retail close to $30-$40 in the real world.
The dvd is very hard to find but they are out there people .
I watched my yard sale copy of  "" Dr. Syn The Scarecrow Of Romney Marsh "" once , enjoyed it again and put it on my bookcase where it will stay until I want to enjoy it again----and you know what ,I sleep just fine .",1410220800,11,1378,4.003663003663004
3535675,5,B001DPHDCE,"Disney's Scarecrow version is absolutely fantastic.  Patrick McGoohan portrays the Scarecrow wonderfully along with anyone else who helped in the portrayal and presentation of this character such as the director.  I really like the cunningness of the Scarecrow and the way his facial mask and tattered scarecrow outfit look, the way he looks when riding a horse, the hideous laugh, gravelly voice, and the frequent cover of darkness that work together to make this noble, exceedingly valuable friend of the poor and oppressed a feared fiend of terror to the abusive government, military tyrants.  Also, the highly pleasurable theme song is one of the best.  I highly recommend this film, DR. SYN: THE SCARECROW OF ROMNEY MARSH to anyone who likes this kind of film.  I really wish that Disney had made more films of The Scarecrow for us Scarecrow fans to enjoy.  I would caution, though, to be careful as to where you purchase the film as from some places, the film is really expensive.  I think I bought my copy from a place that is associated with the amazon site.",1401753600,6,1066,4.824175824175824

3535680,5,B001DPHDCE,It's not a Walt Disney Treasure for nothing. Good story. Good production values. Patrick McGoohan as one of the most chillling villain/heroes ever. What more could one ask for?,1386374400,,176,5.103448275862069
3535681,5,B001DPHDCE,"Fantastic Disney series from my youth! I was very fortunate to get one of the approx. 2,400 DVD sets Disney originally  released at a very reasonable price. Very expensive to procure now. Patrick McGoohan acting skills are wonderful. Quick delivery, undamaged, plays perfectly, great vendor to do business with.

3535682,5,B001DPHDCE,"We are so glad and lucky to have this in our collection. There are many good discriptions about this TV Program and the resulting edited Movie, which both versions are in this box set, so let me say this: Disney did a great job on re-mastering this classic, but they only released a small number of DVDs. This results in the price going off the dial. Disney has always priced their DVDs too high, but when supply meets demand like this, it goes nuclear. Disney's original price was about $30.00. Today the scalpers are asking hundreds of dollars. Bargain before buying.",1385164800,,569,4.643564356435643
3535683,5,B001DPHDCE,"Like many others who grew up in the late '50s and '60s I remember watching ""The Wonderful World Of Disney"". It certainly was the kind of show the whole family could watch and it always had something to interest everyone. Out of all the different movies, documentaries and adventure that appeared on Disney there was one show that even after all these years I can still remember watching over and over when it would appear on Disney, ""The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"". ""Scarecrow"" had everything in it to grab your attention and keep your eyes glued to the TV set. The story certainly kept me enthralled as a child. It was exciting and thrilling and for me as a little kid a little frightening. The sight of the Scarecrow riding on his horse in the night with that laugh of his was kind of a little scary. Yet I could never get enough of it. Of course it was filmed back in the day when television was really in its golden era. Imagination and creativity was at its height way back then. The writers and directors of these kind of shows knew how to make something entertaining and enjoyable to watch as well as interesting. With all the crap and nonsense that they have a television today and not very much of it being suitable for children to watch I can't help but feel sorry for the kids of today that they are not given quality stuff to be able to watch. One of the advantages however of living in todays times at least is there are video tapes and DVDs that have been released with a lot of these classic programs that preserve for future generations these entertaining and enjoyable programs. In the case of ""Scarecrow Of Romney Marsh"" it is both a good news, bad news situation. The good news is that it is available on DVD for purchase. The bad thing is the cost you have to pay to obtain this outstanding program. We are talking well over $100 in order to get a copy. That is just ridiculous the price is that high. Of course when Disney released ""Scarecrow"" on DVD they only put out a limited number of them and they sold out pretty quick. But instead of seeing there was a demand for this program and releasing more of ""Scarecrow"" Disney instead put the video away in their vault keeping the demand high but the number of discs available low. I can highly recommend this movie but good luck if you can find a copy at a reasonable price. If you ever can don't hesitate to get a copy. It will be well worth it.",1379635200,2,2416,4.35920177383592
3535684,5,B001DPHDCE,"The second release of Walt Disney Treasures Wave 8 is a special treat. The three part series of Dr. Syn The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh. The series was very popular back in it's day, so much so, that is was re-edited for theatrical release. The series has a cult following and that combined with a limited run(39,500)has made the second market price go off the charts. It's funny, as I remember when this was released and it wasn't selling very fast, but as soon as something disappears, everybody has to have it!

I also remember seeing this when it was on TV originally and it was one of my first memories of color TV(something my family didn't have until the 70's), I was at my sister's house and I watched this(and Bonanza!)on her new color set. I didn't remember much of the story, but the visuals stuck in my mind for 40 years.!

The two disc set includes all three episodes of Walt Disney's The Wonderful World of Color that featured the three part series on the first disc. The second disc included the theatrical version of the film. Both have been painstakingly restored and have never looked or sounded better(thanks to adding a re-mastered 5.1 soundtrack and re-mastered original soundtrack as well)! The three episodes run around two hours and thirty five minutes and the theatrical film runs around ninety eight minutes, but part of the edits come from the missing Walt Disney Wonderful World of Color introductions and the tune in next week segments. The extras are rounded out with a 16 minute feature-ette on disc one and a 11 minute feature-ette talking about Walt's live action films from England on disc two.

It should be noted that there is a change in packaging on this Wave with both discs being stacked overlap style without any hinged spindle. This is certainly not a change for the better, but every change to the packaging since the series started was a step in the wrong direction, so it is just par for the course.

Overall I enjoyed this set, but if you want to own it, you may have to sell the house or cut off an arm or leg. Prices go from $250.00 to $400.00 on the second market. I do think the extras are a bit thin and it would have been nice to see a stills gallery from the series(surely there are still from this classic?). There is certainly room for it on either of the two discs as disc one is under three hours and the disc two isn't even two hours. The series is full of adventure and showcases Walt doing his best at storytelling and visual perfection.",1378339200,3,2495,4.501103752759382
3535685,3,B001DPHDCE,"As a young boy, I loved Disneys ""Wide World of Color"", and I can recall when this 3 part movie ran very well indeed!  Why? The first 2 episodes were up against the Beatles historic appearence on the Ed Sullivan Show!  Even though I was only 6 years old at the time... Well you just don't forget something like that! So, having an older sister and brother who had ""Beatlemania"" ment I only got to view the third part. So I would love to aquire a copy of this 3 part film.

3535690,5,B001DPHDCE,"Little did I know that some dvds increase in value over time. While others decrease.
I bought this item on a whim in 2008 for 25.00. With the intent to watch it on a free Saturday or Sunday afternoon. But I never got the chance to do it. Flash forward to 2013.
 I found to my wife's chagrin that I had just tooooo many dvds. And like any dutiful
""house slave"" er... husband. I began selling off and trading some in to Amazon.
I saw that I had many unopened and unwatched movies. Dr. Syn being among them.
Imagine my shock when I found out that the price of this (as well as other)Disney
Treasure videos, had shot up to over 350.00! That's Amazon's. On their Seller's page,
it goes from a little over 350.00 collectable to 170.00 used,(in good condition).
Needless to say I sold it. But I do regret not watching it. Disney made some really decent live action films during the 50's and 60's. I do know about their miserly
policy of only releasing films in limited quantity. So that the price will over time
go up. Or in the case of OZ the Great and Powerful, Not release a 3D/2D combo set.
Perhaps if consumers (""en mass"") complain LOUD enough. The Greedy Mouse will relent on its distribution and film release policies.

I got it originally thru Amazon upon release... at the time of release, because I was looking for it before it WAS released, and thru Amazon, I signed up to be informed when it finally WAS going to be released.  For me, it worked perfectly, Amazon sent me an e-mail, and the rest is history.  This is the lesson, that if you are looking for a beloved movie or whatever, and Amazon doesn't have it but asks you if you wish to be notified if it ever is released... don't hesitate to sign up for it!  There is NO obligation to purchase it at all!  Anyway, I didn't realize the value of my pristine kept 'Treasure' until recently.  You all know the movie, the fantastic song, the great Dr. Syn, etc... and though we are not talking Blu-Ray restoration, it is a grand transfer, and does remind me of the days of seeing it Prime Time on Sunday evenings when I was a lad via the Wonderful World of Disney.  I would suggest venting to Disney and not to Amazon to get some version of a re-release, because if you do love Disney or family adventures from days gone by... THIS ONE is a MUST HAVE!

I got ahold of the limited edition DVD by the skin of my teeth. Amazon had already sold out of it within 3 weeks of it's release. Luckily, Best Buy got a hold of a copy for me. I will echo the others here, it is absurd and outrageous to not have a general release of this film. There are plenty of people wanting to see it. I really cannot even imagine what Disney is thinking. I do have a tip for those who have not seen this yet. At the time Disney was making this film, Hammer Films was making their own version. Disney sued and won, so some things in the Hammer version had to be changed, most notably the Scarecrow becomes a minor character but I actually am one of handful who prefer the Hammer version. It is called ""Night Creatures"" and readily available on a Hammer box set on Amazon. It is something to watch while waiting for Disney to act.

I was 10 years odl when this appeared on Disney and I recall being excited about it at the time.  But like millions of others, I ended watching the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show instead.

I wasn't old enough to see the original airing back in 1964, but I have many fond memories of watching it later on in the '60s.  I still remember how excited me and my junior high school friends were when the Scarecrow came on again in the early '70s. Everyone couldn't wait for those Sunday nights!
I am very glad I was able to get my copy and also a backup copy for the original price when the limited edition came out back in 2008. I am totally shocked by what copies of the limited edition are going for now though. $350 for a $24.99 product is beyond outrageous! What is wrong with the marketing people at Disney? Don't they realize how many of their fans were left out in the cold because they either weren't quick enough, or didn't know about the limited release?
They could make a tremendous amount of money with a standard DVD release of this wonderful program, but instead do nothing. And the outrageous price-gouging only encourages bootlegging, from which Disney receives exactly nothing. Great job geniuses..",1342310400,21,1143,4.630541871921182

Most normal companies would have realized they had an in-demand product and would have promptly re-released it. But not Disney. No, they're too good for that! What did they do? They sat back, apparently amused to watch consumers forced to pay ever more outrageous prices for scarce copies of this DVD. Absolutely appalling. They should be ashamed. Gee, do you think they'll grace us with a limited blu-ray release or are we not worthy?

3535713,5,B001DPHDCE,"The second release of Walt Disney Treasures Wave 8 is a special treat. The three part series of Dr. Syn The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh. The series was very popular back in it's day, so much so, that is was re-edited for theatrical release. The series has a cult following and that combined with a limited run(39,500)has made the second market price go off the charts. It's funny, as I remember when this was released and it wasn't selling very fast, but as soon as something disappears, everybody has to have it!

I also remember seeing this when it was on TV originally and it was one of my first memories of color TV(something my family didn't have until the 70's), I was at my sister's house and I watched this(and Bonanza!)on her new color set. I didn't remember much of the story, but the visuals stuck in my mind for 40 years.!

The two disc set includes all three episodes of Walt Disney's The Wonderful World of Color that featured the three part series on the first disc. The second disc included the theatrical version of the film. Both have been painstakingly restored and have never looked  or sounded better(thanks to adding a re-mastered 5.1 soundtrack and re-mastered original soundtrack as well)! The three episodes run around two hours and thirty five minutes and the theatrical film runs around ninety eight minutes, but part of the edits come from the missing Walt Disney Wonderful World of Color introductions and the tune in next week segments. The extras are rounded out with a 16 minute feature-ette on disc one and a 11 minute feature-ette talking about Walt's live action films from England on disc two.

It should be noted that there is a change in packaging on this Wave with both discs being stacked overlap style without any hinged spindle. This is certainly not a change for the better, but every change to the packaging since the series started was a step in the wrong direction, so it is just par for the course.

Overall I enjoyed this set, but if you want to own it, you may have to sell the house or cut off an arm or leg. Prices go from $90.00 to $200.00 on the second market. I do think the extras are a bit thin and it would have been nice to see a stills gallery from the series(surely there are still from this classic?). There is certainly room for it on either of the two discs as disc one is under three hours and the disc two isn't even two hours. The series is full of adventure and showcases Walt doing his best at storytelling and visual perfection.",1305158400,5,2495,4.498896247240618

Fortunately I purchased one when it was released but now, I am disgusted by the ridiculous price gouging by the Marketplace sellers here on the Amazon site.

I have always wanted my own home copy; but unfortunately, Disney has only released it to DVD once, and then, made far too few copies (39,500) to meet the demand.  It was out of stores before I even knew it had been released.

You would think Disney would re-issue it with the current demand so high, especially when used copies are selling for more than $170!  I don't understand Disney's inability to understand modern consumers.  Their old policy of re-issuing children's classics on 7-year cycles is just obsolete in today's market.  If they don't release movies in high demand, consumers will find alternate sources that deprive them of profits.

From that night on he was a Rolling Stones fan LOL:) But thanks 2 Disney's release of this movie on DVD, a couple of years ago I bought the last one @ Target, and I was able to surprise my hubby with it.

3535721,5,B001DPHDCE,"Over all, I'm just a bit too old for most Disney stuff. and even the classics I don't feel a need to return to. but this was just one of those memories from my childhood that will stay with me forever! don't get me wrong. i have a tremendous respect for walt disney. he was a man who was well ahead of his time in many respects. he was a genius! but most of his movies and tv shows were a little too family-oriented for me, and i just don't watch much of that stuff anymore. but this 3-episode serial from walt's tv show ""the wonderful world of color"" is just too good to be ignored! it held a place in my childhood that still endures to this day. in 1964, walt's show was one of the first, if not THE ONLY show to be broadcasting in the brand new 'color tv' format. the world was a much different place then. this serial which takes place in southern england in the spring of 1775 (about a year before the start of the american revolutionary war) is set in a poor farming community where king george's heavy taxation is bleeding the community dry. a local vicar starts a smuggling ring to help his parish and disguises himself as the scarecrow to hide his identity. a general of the british army is sent with troops to catch this upstart and smash his smuggling ring. starring the unforgetable patrick mcgoohan (tv's 'secret agent man' and 'the prisoner') in the title role, this brilliant piece of tv history is a 5-star treasure! the acting is a bit out-of-date but great for its time. the script tries to stay true to the period in which the story is set (very clean and polite...the worse you can say to insult someone is to call him a dog...and that insult is tossed around a lot in this show...and you have to love the class of the english when they still manage to call you 'sir' and 'a dog' in the same sentence). they did a good job spreading the story over 3 episodes. oh, why beat it to death? it's walt disney at his best! they put a second disc in there which includes the movie that they showed in england and europe at the time for countries that did not have walt's tv show. but that is just a 2-hour version of the tv show with a lot of the show cut out. it was interesting to watch, but our tv version was much more complete. and walt's introductions to each installment are included.
so to sum up, i notice they really made no effort to bring back walt's show to dvd for the most part. although a good show at the time, who really remembers any of the other segments? but the scarecrow of romney marsh was remembered, and as leonard malton observed in the disc intro, 'it was one of the most requested titles from the disney library for a number of years'...and with good reason! this is a family classic!  i even remembered all the words to that unforgetable scarecrow theme song! i'm usually not a big fan of the family-oriented movies, but the scarecrow is a blast from the past classic that i just had to have! a bit out-dated by today's standards, but it is disney at his finest!  supurb!",1277337600,,3013,4.293497363796134
3535722,3,B001DPHDCE,"As a boy, I LOVED this adventure tale!  Think of it as a superhero tale in a time utterly devoid of such fare.  Today the world is awash with Iron Man, The Dark Knight, The Man of Steel, The Hulk, etc.--all treated to lavish, big screen renderings.  However, in my childhood, a film (segmented TV presentation or re-edited theatrical versions) of a daring masked hero such as DR. SYN (a.k.a. ""The Scarecrow"") was as rare as hen's teeth.  Such rarity only served to make the delightful quality of this production all the more remarkable.  Just as ""The Dark Knight"" is supposed to be, ""The Scarecrow"" was both unsettling AND inspiring in his on-screen presence.  He both thrilled AND frightened.

To say that I have been waiting YEARS for this material to be available on DVD would be the most ridiculous of understatements.

However, now that this beloved classic is finally within my grasp, it comes with a price tag of nearly $200.00!  Let's just restate that for a moment: a DVD, of a rarely seen Disney multi-part production (with a total running time of under two hours) is being marketed at nearly TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS!  Has Disney taken leave of its senses?!  Even for the Mouse House, this is greed--and short-sightedness--on an astounding scale.  Reasonably priced, this marvelous adventure tale could have sold thousands upon thousands of copies to die-hard, long-time fans like me--to say nothing of the spillover effect of ""word of mouth"" from older fans who would have been only too happy and eager to attempt to introduce another whole generation (or two) of superhero fans to our beloved ""Dr. Syn.""

But at TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS a pop, this prohibitively priced product (""Holy alliteration, Batman!"") must remain naught but a fond memory of my youth.  It makes me wonder what world the Disney Marketing Executives inhabit.  Do they have ANY idea regarding the current state of the American economy?!  I think not.

What a pity we do not have the courage, daring and unflagging integrity of ""The Scarecrow"" to call upon in this, our hour of struggle against the oppressors seeking, once again, to subjugate and tax us beyond all honorable limits.  Striking like a haunting spectre out of the night, he'd soon have these rapacious thieves running for their lives.

""Up with 'The Scarecrow!' Down with these greedy rapscallions!""",1274054400,16,2337,4.915816326530612
3535723,5,B001DPHDCE,"If you were a baby boomer, you may remember this mini-series that ran on Disney.  The DVDs were lots of fun.  It was interesting to watch it many decades later in color (I know my parents did not have a color TV in 1964 when it ran).  The extra are very interesting and provide lots of background on the story line.  The mini series was filmed to allow Disney to run it on TV on three Sunday night running, but in Europe it was edited and shown in movie theaters.  Both versions are on the DVD. Obviously the mini-series version has better/deeper character development because it did not have to fit into the normal movie time formula of being less than two hours. The main character Dr. Syn is actually very three dimensional.  By day he the local pastor and respected member of the ""establishment"", by night he is a ""Robin Hood"" type figure.  The plot is meant to be a little thought provoking about the nature of good and evil and social justice.  It is a great family movie (G type rating).  While the ""Scarecrow"" is a work of fiction, there are quite a few aspect of the story that really were true. It was filmed on location in England and the area (Romney Marsh) was famous for smuggling during 18th and 19th century.  The church in the movie is a real local church (Disney paid to have it restored) etc.  So while it is not an Oscar winning production, it is very well done, hold up very nicely despite being 1960 vintage and for certain groups will bring back lots of memories (baby boomer who watched it on TV, folks in UK from that section of England).  I highly recommend it.",1270684800,2,1587,4.378839590443686
3535724,5,B001DPHDCE,"Oh wow, was I glad to find out that ""Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" became available on DVD! As soon as I could afford it I bought a copy. I never saw this when it was on TV, but I once rented a VHS videotape of the movie version on Halloween and the concept of an evil scarecrow who is actually a good guy fit right in and made for a nice alternative to the usual morbid stuff you get during that holiday.  Later, I found a 1937 British film titled ""Dr. Syn"" starring George Arliss as the same character and roughly following the same plot. I liked that too, but the Disney version is so cool.

I was intrigued to find out that Batman also has a nemesis called The Scarecrow. And he really is evil. So I wonder if the writers of Batman ripped off the idea from Dr. Syn, or if they just came up with it independently. ""Doctor Syn: A Smuggler Tale of the Romney Marsh"" by Russell Thorndike was published in 1915, and Batman's The Scarecrow first appeared in ""World's Finest Comics #3"" (Fall 1941) and was created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane.

3535745,4,B001DPHDCE,"I'm old enough to have seen ""Scarecrow"" in its original run, and vaguely remember it.

It's a solidly made film, but both the script and the direction are several notches below something like the Errol Flynn ""Robin Hood"". What makes ""Scarecrow"" worth seeing is Patrick McGoohan's note-perfect performance. Not only do we believe the character, but he quietly dominates every scene he's in. No wonder Orson Welles admitted to being intimidated by him.

An interesting element is the way Lieutenant Brackenbury is portrayed. Initially confused about the morality of what the government is doing, he slowly and believably ""comes around"" to the point where he is willing to risk his life to save ""criminals"". This adds dramatic interest to what would otherwise be little more than an adventure story.

This DVD was supposedly transferred from the film negative, and looks it -- sharp and detailed, with clean, vivid colors. The sound is disappointing, though. Billed as Dolby 5.1, it appears to be mono with no surrounds in the film (despite the claim that the restoration used the stereo stems).

Even if you're collecting all the ""Disney Treasures"" merely for the sake of completeness, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1234828800,4,1221,5.1206030150753765

3535748,5,B001DPHDCE,"I was fortunate to get my copy of ""Dr. Syn"" through Amazon when they were first made available.  This was one of my Disney favorites from my youth.  I am also a member of the Disney Movie Club and I just received a flyer from them that ""Dr. Syn"" is now available through the club for $29.95.  However, in order to get it you have to first join the club, and ""Dr. Syn"" is not included among the movies they make available to new members when they first sign-up.  At least that's what I found when I accessed the site as a ""new"" member.  When I subsequently logged in as an existing member, ""Dr. Syn"" was listed on the first page!  What they want you to do, obviously, is buy some of their older releases before they let you at the new stuff.  This isn't necessarily bad, however, because they make some other decent oldies available in the new member promotion.  I think the first season (5 DVDs)of ""Zorro"" is among them.  And they give some decent discounts, too.
  By the way, Dr. Syn's Dymchurch is still an active Anglican parish and you can visit it, as I did, for their ""Days of Syn"" festival. It's a real hoot!  Everybody dresses up in period costumes.  I believe you can find photos of this at the Dymchurch website.",1234656000,4,1223,4.334801762114537

3535752,5,B001DPHDCE,"This Disney 2 DVD Collection, The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh tells the story of a late 1700's Robin Hood, Dr. Syn who is both Priest & noble Highwayman of sorts. His battle against the British Soldiers, even the King himself is a legendary tale, portrayed by Patrick McGoohan ( who recently passed away). In fact McGoohan's carear & visability was smoking hot right through the sixties in ""The Saint"" Type starring roles in Danger Man followed by Secret Agent & ending in the often misunderstood Prisoner. I could mention appearances in Movies & TV later but Patrick had pretty well dropped off Viewer's Radar after the Prisoner.
If you were fortunate enough to watch the Scarecrow first time round how could you forget that haunting theme song? I still remembered a few words even today though it has been 45 years since I heard it played. In fact if you are a child of the sixties you will remember the themes of the 4 shows mentioned here as 4 of the best. Another fine touch is the realism in terms of costume, language, structures etc. To me that is something that is really a lost art. The ability or lack of same to portray period pieces spot on. I chaulk that up to professionalism, commitment to an ideal & good old fashioned hard work. Is it a coincidence that the current Pirate movie trilogy is by the same studio? I think not!
Getting back to Patrick McGoohan, he is pretty much the only ""star"" though the actors that played The Squire, His Son & Dr. Syn's right hand man are all familiar faces, turn in great performances but you wouldn't likely remember any of their names. The acting by Patrick as well at least in the persona of Dr. Syn is very laid back, calm & very under control, exactly what the role called for but a flip flop from the wild actions & antics we expected to see from him in the other Agent shows.
In closing, DVD one has the 3 shows as they aired in 64, with Walt's intros & Disc two has a more condensed movie version that aired accross the pond with both Discs featuring extras thrown in as well. If you never saw "" The Scarecrow"" put this on your must view list as it touches on so many themes ( as most great stories tend to), love, action, comedy etc. For those of you that experienced this masterpiece first hand way back when let me assure you it hasn't lost anything, substitute your own word or words for this Disney Treasure!

The original was filmed for cinema but shown on TV and so the films ""borders"" were cut off at both sides. In the dvd they have been restored - looks great on a widescreen TV.

3535762,5,B001DPHDCE,"Based on the Russell Thordike classic books of British smugglers, DR. SYN: THE SCARECROW OF ROMNEY MARSH first appeared as a three part mini-series as part of Walt Disney's WONDERFUL WORLD OF COLOR in 1963. Then known only as THE SCARECROW OF ROMNEY MARSH, this production was set in the southern British coast near Dover during the time of King George III.  Just prior to the American War of Independance, it tells the story of a mild mannered minister (Patrick McGoohan) who helps his over-taxed parishoners by masquarading as the sinister Scarecrow, the leader of the local smuggling ring. Only Mipps, his faithful sexton (George Cole) and the young son of the local Squire (Sean Scully) know his real identity as they outwit the British general (Geoffrey Keen) sent to capture them.  Filmed on location in the actual Romney Marsh area, this is a lush and eye-catching yarn full of high adventure.  McGoohan is perfect in his dual role of the kindly vicar and the harsh-voiced Scarecrow, while Cole adds the right touch of puckish humor as Mipps.  Michael Hordern lends strong support as the put-upon Squire, while Keen makes for a perfectly hissable villian.  With wonderful cinematography and a solid cast, this is definitely one of the highlights of Disney's classic TV show.  The exceptional 2 disc DVD presentation is also lovingly presented with documentaries about the history of the Dr. Syn character, as well as Disney's British studio.  Also included is DR.SYN ALIAS THE SCARECROW, the 2 hour film version of the story that was released for British and overseas markets.  Unfortunately, this handsome DVD edition was sold-out within 2 weeks due to a very limited release by Disney. While this is very regrettable, I would say that it is definitely worth trying to see this delightful adventure and something that I highly recommend.",1231459200,,1845,5.006535947712418

I waited until January 5, but no DVD.  Only then did I learn that the release was sold out.  E-mail to Big Rock went unanswered.  Naturally, I canceled, but Big Rock ignored all e-mails after that for information on when it would be available.  So I bought one on Ebay for more than I would have had to pay.

The only thing that infuriates me is that the Disney corp only released about 40,000 of the dvd's.  It deserves a far wider release.  Why?  Simple.

1.  It's scary.  Watching it, I shivered again just like I did when I was a boy when the Scarecrow appeared--better than any horror movie.

2.  It's noble.  Robin Hood like, Dr. Syn takes from the evil English and gives to the good guys.

3.  The story of the Scarlet Pimpernel can be told many ways.  This is one of them and one of the best.

4.  The movie is beautiful.  Lush photography, most of it on location.

5.  The acting is spectacular.  The whole cast is very special and Patrick McGoohan gives a tour de force performance.

6.  Story, story, story.  No matter how good the special effects, no matter how good the director or actors, you have to have good material.  Walt Disney knew a good story when he saw it.  Face it-- Dr. Syn was very obscure material--Disney hunted and came up with a great trophy.

I would have ordered it right away but I put it on my Christmas list and thought if I didn't get it then I'd order one.  I never dreamed it wouldn't be there after just a few weeks!

Anyway, this is a great film and those of you who got a copy are very fortunate. Five stars for the movie and DVD. Zero stars for Disney's disregard for so many who waited so long for this release.

UPDATE (Jan. 2) :  Well, a copy showed up in the mail today.  I don't know how it happened. Maybe someone ordered it for me from my Christmas list and it came late.  I'm very grateful. I got to watch it today and even though I'm still not happy about Disney's decision for such a small release I have to say that they did an excellent job restoring it. It looks pristine.  Good extras and great sound too.  Patrick McGoohan did such a great job as did everyone.  What a fine and spooky story and what a treat to see it again after all these years.

I shared it with my grandson today.  So now there's another ""Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" fan and he was singing or humming the theme song all evening.

Disney, you owe it to many more children like my grandson to make this film legally available again. This is a great watch for young adults and adults as well. Classic movie making at it's best.",1230681600,6,1507,4.1875
3535770,5,B001DPHDCE,"During the 1960's, Disney produced a series of three episodes of his TV show about a mythical character in England during the late 1700's.  The Dr. Syn episodes were also edited down and turned into a feature length movie.  They have been extremely popular but hard to find over the years.  This fall, Disney finally released them as a limited edition two disc set.

Disc one features the TV episodes that tell the tale of Dr. Syn (Patrick McGoohan).  He is the respected priest of the Romney Marsh area of Southern England during the rule of King George III (you know, the king during the American Revolution).  But at night, he is The Scarecrow, the leaders of a gang of smugglers who attempt to skirt the king's high tariffs and split the money so they can pay their local taxes.

Of course, the king doesn't take it lying down.  He sends General Pugh (Geoffrey Keen) to try to bring The Scarecrow to justice.  He tries to use navy conscription and a traitor to do it.  But when a deserter shows up, will that finally be Dr. Syn's undoing?

The second disc features the theatrical version of the story.  Basically, it takes a little bit from the first episode and combines it with all of the second and third episode.  There is really nothing on the second disc you didn't see on the first, so for the first time I almost feel like the second disc wasn't needed.

But that's not to say what's here isn't fun.  I can understand why the Robin Hood like tale is so popular, it's loads of fun.  Watching Dr. Syn plot his way out of each predicament is amazing.

These discs were worth waiting for.  The film is presented in its original wide screen and has been restored to an almost flawless appearance.  The sound defaults to stereo, but they do have a full surround mix which is amazing as well.

Unfortunately, the discs seem to be selling out already.  If you've missed this story, do your best to track down a copy today.  You won't regret it.",1230336000,4,1948,4.458923512747876

This movie is timeless. Dr. Syn riding through the countryside on horseback with his black cape and sinister-sounding laugh can still trigger chill bumps. With all of today's new technology to enhance action movies, this movie has the ability to amaze the viewer although it was made back in the 60's.

It has everything; the original, the shortened version, Dolby sound, mono sound, and last but not least, Walt Disney. The shortened version is really not worth watching after seeing the original though.  I am puzzled why it is discontinued already, just a few weeks after being released.  I am just happy to have it!

3535787,5,B001DPHDCE,"What a thrill to open this Walt Disney treasure.  Just a fantastic package! DR. SYN: THE SCARECROW OF ROMNEY MARSH was a Disney presentation in three parts aired on NBC in February 1964.  As a child I was awestruck by this production, which I viewed over my Grandma's television after Sunday dinner for three consecutive weeks.  I never forgot it. It captivated me! I guess I am still a kid at heart because it hasn't lost any of it's appeal this being forty-four years later. (Can it be? That's alot of years!)  It's a Robin Hood tale set in eighteenth century England- the story of a country parson who masquerades as a smuggler to benefit the welfare of the local citizens.  Press gangs and high taxes roil the community, but Scarecrow, played by Patrick McGoohan, defies the King and his cronies for the greater good. The fun is watching just how he does it! A great morality tale and a true story besides! There's adventure, suspense, intrigue and action, and the acting and direction are nothing less than SUPERB! Patrick McGoohan as the parson is my favorite, but  George Cole, Tony Britton and Sean Scully, prominent British actors at the time, deliver top rate performances as well. The DVD transfer is sparkling clear and the audio crisp and robust sounding. The Scarecrow's demonic laughter will chill you to the bone! The DVD set consists of two discs, one of the original presentation on Disney's Wonderful World of Color (Walt Disney himself introduces each segment) and the other, a theatical version released in Britain as a full motion picture. The set comes in a real metal tin much like old film reels would be housed in, and there is a booklet and publicity photo included.
This is a limited series set and mine is numbered 34,984 out of 39,500. (So, you see, time is running out...)
I suggest you order now because my guess is this marvelous movie is going to be sold out FAST!!  I know you will love this brilliant production as much as I have, and if you have kids, they will be completely mesmerized.
A real DISNEY treasure you'll love to own.",1228694400,4,2067,4.646575342465753

There is a short scene from episode one which is repeated in episode three--a small editing goof.  Other than that this is a simply stunning faithful restoration of this wonderful series.  It is great to see the show just as it originally aired.  The Wonderful World of Color logo, Walt's intros, and teasers for the next episode are all there.  Originally filmed in England, on film, using a wide-screen format, it is presented on DVD from HD transfer in 16x9 aspect ratio.  Walt's office introductions were also filmed the same way and there is an option to see those in wide-screen too.  Disc one also has a history of the Dr. Syn character in literature and film.  Disc two has the European feature, with a bonus section about Walt Disney's films shot in England.  Both discs have Leonard Maltin introductins.  Ditto on all the other comments about how great a story this is.  If you can find one at a decent price, by all means get one!!",1228608000,5,1048,4.5212765957446805

The writing is awesome, so is the acting.  I remember watching this as a kid and I was blown away by the story.  I was very impressed with Sean Scully's performance as the son of the local noble who was also one of the Scarecrow's henchmen.  I remember thinking I would never be as cool in those situations.  They would hang me for sure.

I was 8 years old again.  I've watched it 3 times (twice for me and once with the kids).  I can't get tired of it.

3535795,5,B001DPHDCE,"Thirteen days after the long awaited release of this DVD the manufacturer pulled the plug on its supply. The note on the description says, ""his item has been discontinued by the manufacturer!"" Talk about a real ""Limited Series!"" Anyone who was alive to see the original airing of the Micky Mouse Club will pass on that one in favor of the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh. I hope Patrick McGoohan got a copy for himself. No after Thanksgiving holiday gift giving of this DVD. If you did not purchase it in the first 13 days, then you may be out of luck.

This DVD is going to end up like the DVD version of Peter Pan with Mary Martin, Cyril Ritchard, Maureen Bailey, and Margaio Gillmore which at times has sold for 300 plus dollars new and used.  A lot of these so-called new DVDs are actually DVD-R. I think pulling Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh is just going to promote bootleg DVD-R copies being sold in the internet. Another sad case of the manufacturer who could care less than the real fans of the movie and the Disney series.

I have not seen a DVD release and short run on the market like this one. I am wondering if they sold enough to make production value, or was it basically done as a right-off, and a public service. It it was done as a public service, then I would think they would have produced enough to have it being sold for sometime so new people learn about the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh.

I guess this means there may be hope for a two week release of FOOL'S PARADE,  FLIM-FLAM MAN, and LEADBELLY movie DVDs.",1227657600,9,1533,4.346153846153846
3535796,5,B001DPHDCE,"On 11/10/2008, I was chatting with my friend about all the cool things we watched when we were kids. When Disney Sunday's came up, the first thing I blurted was ""Wow...the Scarecrow was GREAT!"" My friend could not recall seeing it. ""Oh...it had that British actor in it. He was AWESOME! He was also in 'The Prisoner' and 'Silver Streak'!"" But I could not recall his name. So when I got home, I googled and discovered it was Patrick McGoohan. I went a bit further in my search and discovered Amazon's reviews of the VHS of 'The Scarecrow' that was released years ago. I eagerly read through the reviews to see if people of this time period liked the show as much as I did back in 1964. And to my relief, they did. I read one after the other until finally there was only one review left. It simply said ""Thank God they're releasing the DVD on 11/11/2008!"" OMG!!!! ""That's tomorrow,"" I thought with glee! And sure enough, the next morning...there it was for sale on Disney.com! I immediately bought it. It came later in the week. I busted it open and popped in Disk One. From that moment until it ended some few hours later was one of the most visceral experiences of my life. Man...I mean I experienced some of the deepest, emotional, childhood memory trips of my life. It was all as I remember! The great story...the great acting...the great theme song...it was really like Tinkerbell had hit me over the head with her magic wand. Today, I found out that it has sold out of the 35,000 copies made. I see here on Amazon there might be a few left at the original pricing...but already there are some for sale for over $100. I go back now to the start of my review...discussing Disney on 11/10/2008...and then being able to buy something this awesome from my childhood...the very next day. I feel sorry for those who won't get to see it yet for awhile. But I think now that the Disney corporation has seen what a following this short little 3-part mini-series had that it won't be too long before they release it again on Blu-ray. And oh yes...I'll be buying it, too!",1227571200,2,2063,4.4603174603174605
3535797,5,B001DPHDCE,"At least from all the glowing reviews on here, which is why I decided to give it a try. Its not often anything on amazon has so many excellent reviews so this one caught my attention. I have no memories of watching it, as I was not even born when it aired, but I remember watching Disney on Sunday nights and it was always special.
To begin, this show has a collection of excellent actors, beginning with Patrick McGoohan as Dr. Syn/Scarecrow, a dual performance he pulls off magnificently. He commands the screen either as the quiet and calm Vicar or the intimidating and spooky Scarecrow. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well and is a reminder that a show doesnt need a huge budget and effects to be immensely entertaining.
From the opening scenes in episode 1, when Scarecrow, Hellspite and Curlew deflect the King's men from a smuggling operation to the ending, when they aid in freeing prisoners for a trip to 'soon to be free' America, there is not a dull moment to be found. I loved every moment, either in the tv episodes or in the edited movie form. They are both well worth the money.
I buy dvd's fairly often and especially new releases, but this is one of the most entertaining dvd's Ive bought. If you love quality acting, excellent storytelling and great adventure, get this while you can. Forget that it was made for tv in 1964. This is timeless entertainment.",1227484800,4,1382,4.532

I remember watching ""Dr. Syn, the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" when it first aired on the Wonderful World of Color and couldn't wait for the next episode.  This was Patrick McGoohan at his best and I immediately fell in love with the cool, intelligent, handsome vicar.

The images and sounds will leap out of your screen/home theatre. And to top it off, the original introductions by Uncle Walt are included which I have not seen since I saw these episodes originally on the ""Wonderful World of Color"" in 1964. It is clear the people who produced this DVD made it a labor of love.  My only complaint, and it is a small one, is that I would have liked to have seen more interviews with some of the original cast and production personnel (though even the short pieces with Patrick McGoohan were enough to bring tears to my eyes.)

Not sure why it took so long but I am thankful that it is finally here.  I am not sure what drew me to this series when I saw it at age 8, but I clearly remember not being able to sleep the night before because I knew the next episode was coming the following day.  My biggest problem is keeping in mind that this is happening in Southern England, for some reason I want to think this is right here in colonial USA.  I really identified with young John when I saw it the first time, I recognized the actor from the Prince and the Pauper which in my opinion is another great film and that certainly added to my enjoyment.  I was not aware that an economic disaster was responsible for all of my good fortune but I guess we need to be thankful that there was a silver lining there for both GB and Disney as well as the millions of fans that have seen these great films since then.  Perhaps we will see something similar come out of the current economic crisis - you never know.  As an eternal pessimist (I define a pessimist as an INFORMED optimist) I do not usually look on the bright side, but right now I need something to hold on to so I will hope that we will see something positive come out of this, in fact I think perhaps we already have, the USA has shown the world that we are still a land where a man who had very little could pull himself up and become president of the US.

This 2-DVD set delivers the 3-part ""Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" (I sat glued to the TV and thrilled to every minute of it as a kid) and the feature-length movie version that later surfaced on cable and elsewhere.

As Leonard Maltin mentions in his commentary, the ""movie"" version was so skillfully edited that you won't notice what's missing until you watch the 3-parter and take careful notes.

The justly-acclaimed actor Patrick McGoohan shines here.

He plays the Vicar / Scarecrow as an emotionally balanced character with a clearly defined sense of right and wrong. The ""Joseph Ransley"" betrayal arc is handled beautifully. As The Scarecrow, McGoohan can be cackling like a demon possessed, but within a split second of removing his mask he is once again cool, calm, and collected.

This film was a true rarity in the Disney universe. As a kid, I loved it. I thought McGoohan and his cohorts were terrifying. I eagerly awaited each weekly segment. As an adult, I can appreciate the beautiful cinematography, the tight script, the flawless acting.

In 1964, when I first saw it on Disney's The Wonderful World of Color anthology program, I was 12 years old and it struck me as both wonderful entertaining and really fine storytelling.  The performances, led by Patrick McGoohan's stellar turn as Vicar Christopher Syn, are all excellent.  Incredibly, in watching it again over the weekend, I find that the film has not been ""dated"" at all.  I never got the feeling while playing it of wondering what on Earth I'd seen in it back then as I do sometimes when looking back at movies and series that were a staple of my childhood.

3535806,5,B001DPHDCE,"Of the three newest Walt Disney Treasures DVD packages, this is perhaps the lesser known, but it is by no means the least important. It's what used to be known as ""rip-roaring"" great adventure, produced on a rich, grand scale unheard-of during the period in which it first appeared.

""Dr. Syn,"" which was based on British novels and legends explained on a fascinating documentary also included on disc one, is a Robin Hood or Zorro of sorts. But the difference is that Dr. Syn is a highly respected minister who completely fools the pompous bad guys. Yet, in this three-part series, the villains are fleshed out and not caricatured. The dignity and seriousness of the drama holds up beautifully today without the slightest sense of clich.

In this 2-disc set, you get all three WONDERFUL WORLD OF COLOR hours with introductions by Walt himself, plus the edited feature-length version released theatrically in Europe in the 60's and then in the U.S. in the 1970's. But the aspect ratio of the original print has been restored for this release so you'll even see the television versions in more depth than before, with gorgeous restored prints and sound that especially brings out the lush musical score (I wish it was on a separate track!)

And speaking of music, you'll get to see who sings the haunting ""Scarecrow"" theme--Terry Gilkyson, who also wrote ""The Bare Necessities,"" along with George Patterson and The Wellingtons. The only detail left out is that The Wellingtons are best known for singing the Gilligan's Island theme in its first season (there's more about them in ""Mouse Tracks"").

The other mini-documentary traces Walt Disney's long and fruitful live-action movie enterprises in the United Kingdom with comments by several of those involved including director Ken Annakin. It's great that the live-action part of Walt Disney's art is getting recognized and appreciated.

Most of all, if you are a fan of the TV classics The Prisoner or Secret Agent, you have to have this because Patrick McGoohan is in top form in this film, even to his remarkably varied speaking voice which transforms his character as much as his mask.",1226620800,100,2139,4.947075208913649

Second, my five-year old was RIVETED to the TV when the theme song came on and was mesmerized throughout the show.

One is a Walt Disney Production, fun and telling and the other is a staight horror movie.  The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh is just one of the best Disny serials that was ever done.  I know that I could not wait to see it every time is was on and to be able to buy it now is unreal.  If you want class entertainment, a novel approach, mystery, suspense, murder, betrayal, and good old fashioned movie serial look no furthert than the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh. No Disney production before or after had quiet the effect this had on me and my sister.  Where else can you go around wanting to be a scarecrow or any of the other of his band.  I always liked when they did the reveal and it turned out to be the minister.  Patrick McGoohan was excellent in the part and it showed that just because it was Disney did't mean that they could not tell a story full of twist and turns.  It was one of the best adventures that was put on in the 60's.  I can not wait to get my hands on a copy so I can at least relive one aspect of my childhood.  Here to the Scarecrow and his men!!!!!!

I was 5 in 1964, yet I still remember the song, and the laugh. Everything was just as I remember it (including some rather over-the-top acting by the Squire's daughter).

I loved that this had the Disney World of Color eps as aired including the starting of that show and Walt Disney's intros. Brought back many memories.

But best of all were the eps themselves. Such great adventures. Such great memories!

I could still remember the words and melody of the theme song many years later -- even having only seen it twice. I didn't see the film again for over 30 years when I obtained a bootleg VHS copy. I am so glad Disney finally restored and released this great adventure movie. Any boy between the ages of 5 and 12 will absolutely love this film, guaranteed. And there's no corny jokes, goofy pop culture references, pop ballads, graphic violence, sex or bad language -- imagine that! Treasure indeed. Why can't Disney (or any one else for that matter) make movies like this anymore?

As aside, even though I thought Ian McKellen did a great job as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings, my first pick would have been Patrick McGoohan. I guess he was too old by the time LotR was filmed, but imagine McGoohan (who plays the Scarecrow here and also played the King Edward in Braveheart) as Gandalf.

3535822,5,B001DPHDCE,"""Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" features all three original TV episodes of the Wonderful World of Disney miniseries. It is presented for the first time ever in widescreen format, with an all-new digital restoration 5.1 audio mix as well as the original restored mono track. Fans have waited a long time for this one on DVD, and it has been well worth the wait. As Leonard Maltin describes in the introduction, both the picture and the audio have undergone extensive restoration, going back to the original film and sound elements. Seriously, folks: the 5.1 sound mix will blow you away; sounds as if it was recorded yesterday...the hooves of the horses, the beautiful score...truly amazing. The DVD also includes the theatrical film version, released exclusively in England.

Based on the popular series of three novels created by Russell Thorndike, ""Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" tells the story of a mild-mannered parson by day who becomes the Scarecrow, an anonymous champion of the oppressed by night. Kind of a Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde meets Robin Hood. He robs the greedy King of England and gives the money to the overtaxed citizens of his parish. Patrick McGoohan is fantastic in the lead role; mild in the role of the parson, and chilling (especially the voice) as The Scarecrow. Filmed in England, the cinematography is lush and vibrant.

Bonus features include:

* Dr. Syn: The History of the Legend - A look at the evolution of the legend of Dr. Syn from his literary origins to the Walt Disney film version. Includes interviews with Patrick McGoohan.

* Walt Disney: From Burbank To London - A featurette about the first satellite studio established by Walt Disney in the 1950s in England as a way to spend monies that had been ""frozen"" overseas.

* Walt Disney TV Introductions in Widescreen. Always thinking forward, Walt had these introductions shot in widescreen, even though TVs of the 60s would cut off both sides of the picture.

This set also includes a Certificate of Authenticity (set limited to 39,500 copies) as well as a postcard size publicity photo of Dr. Syn (Patrick McGoohan).",1226102400,9,2123,4.883333333333334

3535824,5,B001DPHDCE,"Absolute awesome show! I remember this from ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" on Sunday nights when I was a kid. I loved the theme song, with lyrics like ""the great Scarecrow would ride from the jaws of Hell and laugh..."" Wow, Disney wouldn't dare make anything like that now-a-days. I actually thought this show was scary when I was younger.

The theme song lyrics tell you the basics of the whole story:

Scarecrow! Scarecrow!
The soldiers of the King feared his name. Scarecrow!

On the southern coast of England, there's a legend people tell,
Of days long ago when the great Scarecrow would ride from the jaws of Hell
And laugh (Ahhh! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Haaa!) with a fiendish yell!

With his clothes all torn and tattered,
Through the black of night he'd ride,
From the marsh to the coast like a demon ghost
He'd show his face then hide (He'd rob the rich then hide)
And he'd laugh (Ahhh! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Haaa!) till he split his side!

Scarecrow! (Scarecrow!) Scarecrow! (Scarecrow!)
The soldiers of the King feared his name.
Scarecrow! (Scarecrow!) Scarecrow! (Scarecrow!)
The country folk all loved him just the same. Scarecrow!

He would always help the farmer, when there was no gold to bring,
He'd find a way for the poor to pay the taxes of the King
""Scarecrow!"" - every man would sing! (With gold from a smuggler's ring!)

So the King told all his soldiers, ""Hang him high or hang him low,
But never return till the day I learn He's gone in flames below (He rides in flames below)
Or you'll hang - with the great Scarecrow!""

Scarecrow! (Scarecrow!) Scarecrow! (Scarecrow!)
The soldiers of the King feared his name.
Scarecrow! (Scarecrow!) Scarecrow! (Scarecrow!)
The country folk all loved him just the same.
Scarecrow! Scarecrow! Scarecrow! (Ahhh! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-haaa!)",1225670400,2,1784,4.826229508196722

It was a staple for most American families in the 1960s. It was one of the first programs to bring excellent family movies right into our homes. I am thrilled that the Disney company has continued to show an interest in what people want as Walt himself did when he was alive. I have pre-orderd this because along with the fact I know the show well, there is no doubt in my mind the quality of the DVDs will be excellent. This set includes the three episodes aired by Disney on TV and the British released movie. Patrick McGoohan is brilliant in this series and his flair would become renowned by the time he moved on to other movies and series like ""The Prisoner"". At this time it is not clear if it includes any interviews but I would be surprised if it doesn't have an intro by Walt Disney and a cartoon from that period. I have purchased several of the Treasure releases and they were all first class quality  picture, sound, extra features, and packaging. I highly recommend this series.

This movie 'changed my life' since it was the first film I ever saw at a cinema as the 'B' film with 'The Sword and the Stone' and frightened me so much (Pat MacGoohan's make-up and voice) that it was instilled in a six year old's memory as his first 'horror' movie! I have try to find this for about twenty years, reading that Disney were to release it and then not. I even bought a rather poor quality video of the movie which, at least gave me a taste of what I had seen so many years ago, but wished that the problems that seemed to stop it being released on DVD could be eradicated.
Now, it finally gets its release and I can't wait!
Does anyone know if there any extras on it? A Leonard Maltin introduction and history of the TV series/Movie would be great.

Several years ago, I acquired a digital copy of the theatrical release that premiered the film, and it is shorter than the 3-part series.
