1348185,5,B00004STDA,"The Emperor and the Assassin is a sweeping epic from the director of ""Farewell My Concubine"" and ""Temptress Moon."" This film is undeniably one of the best 5 of the year and is strongly reminiscent of  a Kurosawa or Lean film, whether in terms of lush photography or deep  character studies. Though not ranking at the films of those directors, this  film stands on its own as one of the best epics I've seen in a long time.  The story follows a ruthless, cold-blooded emperor who will do anything to  reach up to the highest level of rulership, a reformed and moral assassin,  and the emperor's wife, who bring those two forces together. Though running  at a length of 161 minutes, this film cruises by very fast, with realistic  battle scenes, almost exactly like Ran and long, sprawling, unforgettable  shots like Lawrence of Arabia. There are extremely good performances all  around, and a complexed, but fully revealing storyline, which makes this a  fascinating, highly ambitous masterpiece.",956966400,31,995,4.933734939759036

1348189,4,B00004STDA,"Kind of a weird movie.  Part of it is it seems weird to me because as some white guy from the U.S. I am not seeing things exactly the same as a person of Chinese descent might see them.  Also I feel like there is some kind of government influence going on here as well, because the movie made the up and coming emperor seem like a real butthead, but then the guy assigned to kill him looked just as much like a butthead.  I think they both might have been made out to look more buttheadish than perhaps they actually were, simply because they didn't belong to the Communist party.

But you have an interesting history going on here, and you have Gong Li weaving her way through it, so that accounts for the 4 stars.",1449187200,,715,4.197080291970803

1348197,5,B00004STDA,This is an excellent film.  It takes a few liberties with history but for the most part manages to accurately portray China as a country at constant civil war just prior to its first real unification under the Qin Dynasty.  If nothing else it's worth watching just to see the beautiful actress Gong Li!,1406073600,,302,4.574074074074074
1348198,5,B00004STDA,"""The Emperor and the Assassin"" is a fascinating story that really happened in China before the King of Qin went about the hard work of uniting the existing seven states under one flag and one ruler. You will be on the edge of your chair as so many nuances unfold - some startling, some shocking, and some unforgettable. Actress Gong Li is brilliant as the beautiful woman who is caught in the middle of the action between the kingdoms (states) of Zhao and Qin, and Zhan, but uses logic, manipulation, and cunning to survive it all. The Assassin is wonderful, scary, and heart-warming all-at-once! You will love ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" as it sends you through a plethora of emotions and reactions!",1385164800,,703,4.723577235772358

1348203,5,B00004STDA,"This old Chinese wisdom, which can be understood in many different ways, all very instructive, was inspired by THE most famous assassination attempt in history of China, which occurred in year 226 BC - the attack of Jing Ke from Kingdom of Yan on King Ying Zheng, ruler of Qin, who was later to become Qin Shihuangdi, the First Emperor of China. This most excellent film, directed by the renowned Chen Kaige (he also directed ""Farewell my concubine""), describes the background to this archifamous episode, all the preparations for the assassination, the event itself and its consequences.

The story sticks as much as possible to the description of events in the ancient chronicle by Sima Qian, who was writing 120 years later, when the memory of this incident was still very much alive (although already covered in legend). So, before watching this movie, here is, very shortly, the reminder of the REAL story, as Sima Qian described it. In year 226 BC, the kingdom of Qin just finished swallowing the kingdoms of Han and Zhao and therefore reached an exceptionnal level of power. The remaining Chinese kingdoms of Yan, Wei, Qi and Chu were unable to reach an agreement on alliance against the agressive superpower and remained passive and divided. Dan, the crown prince of Yan, faced with the indecision of his own father and certain that his country would be next to be attacked, decided to organise the assassination of the ruler of Qin. For that purpose he found a volunteer amongst the noblemen from his attendance to perform a suicide mission - the name of this man was Jing Ke. He was to go to Qin to pay respects to king Ying Zheng and bring him two gifts - the head of a Qin dissident who searched asylum in Yan and a wonderful map of Yan painted on silk. Both maps and the heads of enemies were widely known as being weak spots of Qin's ruler and therefore the crown prince of Yan was almost certain that Jing Ke would obtain a personal audience with the king and would be allowed to personally open and display the map - in which was hidden a deadly secret...

In the film the character of Jing Ke was somehow changed and was mixed with another famous Chinese assassin from those times, but otherwise the film respects quite well the ancient chronicle account. Other elements from Sima Qian chronicle are also well taken into account - it is known, that king's favourite concubine was from the kingdom of Zhao and in the film the Lady of Zhao (played by Gong Li) plays indeed a very great role. Chen Kaige plays himself a very important role, of Chancellor Lu Buwei, who according to a very tenacious rumor, was in fact king's Ying Zheng real father... Other famous authentic persons appear in the film, like Lao Ai, a ""false"" eunuque, and also general Fan Wuji, the dissident from Qin who willingly accepts to kill himself so his head can serve as bait for king's Ying Zheng assassination...

I found this movie absolutely fascinating! It's definitely better than any other Chinese film about ancient history, for many reasons, of which not the least is that there is NO idiotic kung fu stunts! You will not find here people flying and floating over the trees, no martial arts displays, no ""magic"" secret weapons - the fights, when showed, are realistic. There is also no clear divide between villains and ""good guys"" (the thing that horribly hurt the ""Three Kingdoms"") - there are harsh realities of politics, strategy and war.

Actors are simply stunning, the scenario is waterproof and the fidelity to the ancient historical sources is very well respected. And the story in extremely powerful and leaves us with more questions than answers, which leaves place for a lot of reflection on the nature of power, good, evil, loyalty, crime, punishment and atonement. I absolutely recommend this movie as an obligatory viewing for anybody interested in Ancient China and its history. Enjoy!",1331251200,,3900,4.764792899408284
1348204,4,B00004STDA,"Very cool movie from a Chinese perspective. The costumes and set puts any history lover right into the thick of ancient China. The story moves along nicely with plenty of drama and action. Although this film is an enjoyable piece of Chinese propaganda (similar to Hero where the ruthlessness of China's 1st emperor is explained as serving the greater good), the story within (about the same ruthless Ying Zheng) is told with a certain sense of integrity that allows the viewer to observe and form their own conclusions in the end.

Based on action and drama, I would highly recommend this movie in general, but if you enjoy historical themed movies this is a must. Consider it a Chinese alternative to Braveheart--philosophically different and factually suspect but still finds a way to put you there then.",1327363200,,806,4.926470588235294
1348205,5,B00004STDA,"This movie is about the Emperor whose tomb was recently unearthed in China where he was buried with his terra cotta army of soldiers and horses.  Very well filmed.  Although it is not with English dub, the story is so engrosing that you forget and eagerly read the English subtitles.  I've watched it several times and notice something new each time I see it.",1270684800,,359,4.578125
1348206,3,B00004STDA,"Chen Kaige's The Emperor and the Assassin was one of the more expected Chinese flops of the 90s, coming so soon after the previous telling of the same tale, The Emperor's Shadow had failed to set the box-office alight and long before the stylised Hero would become a breakout international success. Indeed, the running joke at the time was that Chen Kaige thought The Emperor's Shadow only flopped because he didn't direct it.

China seems to have the same attitude to its First Emperor (Li Xuejian) as France does to Napoleon, alternating between admiration for the best of his achievements and condemnation for the methods he used to pursue them, and the film does at least embrace these contradictions in its portrait of an often childish but visionary Emperor wanting to end 550 years of hell and unite all of China under one benevolent ruler through increasingly ruthless means. Unlike previous versions of the story, here he even plans to manipulate a rival kingdom into sending an assassin (Jing Ke) to kill him to give him an excuse to invade, despatching his childhood love (Gong Li) as agent provocateur to arrange it only for her to find her sympathies shifting as the Emperor becomes increasingly merciless...

Less political than Shadow (though the film was heavily cut by the Chinese censors) and more down to Earth than Hero (the visual palette is much more subdued, favoring earth tones over vivid colors), despite the huge budget, Kaige doesn't really have a feel for spectacle and it's not exactly directed with a surfeit of imagination: the battle scenes are often more functional than inspired despite their scale while the massive sets are rarely employed to their best advantage. Nor is the film's structure always helpful: divided into various chapters of varying degrees of success, it sometimes lends the film a disjointed feel. As a result it's a film that tends to work in fits and starts rather than feeling like a completely successful film, with sideline characters like Kaige's Prime Minister or Wang Ziwen's Marquis constantly playing the fool to avoid being seen as a threat often far more vivid than the central trio. It's far from a disaster, but it wears its length and importance a little too heavily to make for a fully satisfying film.

The DVD  has  an  acceptable though not outstanding  1.85:1  widescreen transfer with  an English  language director's commentary  and US theatrical trailer the only extras.",1219536000,8,2449,4.977941176470588
1348207,5,B00004STDA,"I'm starting to think that Sony Pictures Classics (for foreign films) means ""movies we don't expect to sell well, so we won't spend the money on a dub that might actually make them sell well...""

It seems that several good movies have failed to get a decent dub, including the Emperor and the Assassin and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Suriyothai/dp/B0000DBJ2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Suriyothai</a>&nbsp;(which I very much wanted to see, only to be disappointed at no English track)...

The lack of an English track (despite having a Spanish track {!}) aside, the movie was quite a good drama. However, for some reason I was expecting it to be a martial arts movie (since it was suggested when I was viewing other martial arts movies).

I don't know whether I liked it as much as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curse-of-the-Golden-Flower/dp/B000MRA592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curse of the Golden Flower</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-the-Black-Scorpion/dp/B00104AYGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of the Black Scorpion</a>, which were both something of dramas but had plenty of martial arts action as well. In any event, I still rather liked the movie despite its language and martial arts deficits. It was quite entertaining. So, if you're into foreign dramas, epic war / politics dramas, you might like this one (keeping in mind it's not especially a martial arts piece, and it's not in English in its current release incarnation).",1219017600,3,1635,6.525345622119816
1348208,4,B00004STDA,"The Emperor and the Assassin is loosely based on the first Emperor of early China. During the time of Ying Zheng's rule, the collection of states had been unified after much war and fighting.  At the start of the film, Zheng is on his throne, powerful but paranoid.  Perhaps there is good reason for that.  A court official plots against him.  His wife (actress Gong Li)is spying for him in her home state, which is still resentful of being forced to submit to the king.  Or is she really a double agent?  And can Zheng even trust his own mother?  An assassin is sent to kill Zheng, but the assassin is reeling from a recent tragic event that he himself caused.

The cast features a ton of famous Chinese actors, even comedians who here play serious roles.  The acting is hilariously over-the-top.  The costumes and sets bring the viewer back to the time of the Qi Dynasty.  Recommended, but there is a disturbing scene of the murder of two children, an actual historical event.  Sorry, if you don't like subtitles, the film is only available in Mandarin audio with English subtitles.",1199059200,2,1084,4.617801047120419
1348209,5,B00004STDA,"If you're a fan of Gong Li, you have to watch this movie.  Forget about Chinese history, this movie is about Gong Li.  I have watched all her other movies, but she's absolutely gorgeous in this movie as are her acting and the costumes.  Like one of the reviewers (Vu H.

1348212,2,B00004STDA,"As far as sweeping spectacles go, this isn't one I'd recommend.  It moves far too slow to be anything gripping and intense.  Although Gong Li illuminates the screen every second she's on it's not enough to raise the bar for everyone around her.  Fact remains; she's the only actress/actor that can hold her own in this film.  As it chronicles the rise of Ying Zheng in 221 BC, `The Emperor and the Assassin' fails to really establish a worthwhile cinematic experience.  In fact, this reminds me a bit of 2004's `Alexander' in that it had so much potential but truly failed to capitalize on it.  As Lady Zhao, Zheng's lover, Gong Li is fantastic, but as Zheng, Li Xuejian is somewhat annoying, and don't even get me started on Zhiwen Wang who plays Marquis Chanxin, the Queen Mothers lover.  The battle sequences are few and far in between, and even they don't truly stack up.  I just wasn't impressed with this film, not in the least.  The acting was comical (all except Gong) and the overall direction the film took was a major disappointment.",1168214400,3,1044,4.630434782608695
1348213,5,B00004STDA,"For the spectacle of its scale---extras numbering into the tens of thousands in some scenes; sets the size of small cities; its period details intricate to the most minute degree---and for the engrossing story it tells, The Emperor And The Assassin is a truly amazing motion picture. Available in a subtitled edition, this Mandarin-language motion picture from China's Beijing Studios is slow-moving, huge in every meaning of the word, and challenging to take in. It is also an epic unlike any made in the United States in several generations.

The background information is this: 2300 years ago when China was fragmented into a number of warring petty states, the leader of the militant Kingdom of Qin felt it was his destiny to conquer all of China and bring it under the rule of a single dynasty---naturally his own.  This violent, fearless warrior-king, played by with haughty charisma by the actor Li Xuejian, was not content to merely absorb rival territories, he, with his legions of chariots and miles-long lines of armored foot soldiers, sought to obliterate them past any possibility of future revolt. His cruelty, which he justified to himself by proclaiming coming glories that would possible only in a nation united under a single banner, is at times truly horrid to behold.

This visionary king, Ying Zheng, knew also that mighty though his armies were, not all of his foes could be made to topple except via pressure applied from within. To this end Ying Zheng enlists the aid of his one-time lover, the radiantly beautiful Lady Zhao. The king details to her a plot by which she is to pretend to have fallen from his favor, and out of her hatred convince others at a rival court that she harbors a wish for revenge upon him. He sends her to a powerful enemy kingdom, Yan, her face branded, her reputation tarnished, disgraced, fallen, and there she is to use all her wiles to convince an assassin to fall in love with her and avenge her name by murdering the king who had so abused her. A pretext for war with Yan thereby achieved, Ying Zheng will then invade his foe with allies outraged at this would-be regicide (a dark crime under Confucian Chinese morality).

Ever loyal, Lady Zhao obeys her king and travels to Yan and earns the trust of an assassin, a formidable but somewhat pitiful figure, tortured by and in his own past, unable to find peace, pathetic in his love for the conniving Lady Zhou, whom he loves, unaware of her impending betrayal of him. Lady Zhou primes the assassin's hatred of the King, and fills his head with notions of the justice that will be served by the revenge he'll obtain for both of them. All seems to be transpiring according to Ying Zheng's plans, until his own widescale cruelty toward any and all foreign kingdoms in his path begins to disgust even Lady Zhou. (In one haunting scene we see masses of children dying as they are driven from the height of a fortified wall, and the question of whether any earthly prize, even a unified China, could be justified by such evil is raised and answered with the same resounding NO that Zhou feels.)

Turning at last against her king and lover, Lady Zhou sends the assassin off, now hoping he will succeed in his quest and rid China of a megalomaniacal monster of a man.

Welding together ancient Chinese history and cinematic storytelling of god-like proportions, The Emperor And The Assassin finds a perfect medium in DVD format, and brings to the west the tale of one minor incident within one of the bloodiest and most destructive periods in the entire history of the world.",1160956800,4,3575,4.721153846153846
1348214,5,B00004STDA,"The Emperor and the Assassin, brings to the screen the story of King Ying Zheng as he tries to conquer the remaining 6 kingdoms and unite China under his rule. The story gets more complicated as things are not as they seem in 3rd Century BC China...

The film combines romance, drama, action, intrigue and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!  In addition, there are quite a lot of unexpected twists, which add to the overall enjoyment of the movie.

Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film.

The plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.

Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.

Needless to say, Fengyi Zhang, Li Gong, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.

The setting, the dialogues, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!

The only setback is that at times it is a little difficult to follow which means the viewer needs to be attentive at all times.

Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, yet alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts.

Strongly recommended along with the House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Hero, to those with a soft spot for all things Chinese.  4 Stars",1132531200,8,1608,4.867647058823529

Nothing could slight the stunning visuals managed by this leisurely meditation on Chinese history -- based on fact as it were -- it positively bursts with action like Kurosawa's ""Ran"" from time to time. The portraits of palatial life, honor, tradition, basically the usual nine yards, are captivating.

But amid this microscopic attention to visual detail and plot intricacies, characterizations get the cold shoulder. Our kings and queens and generals and concubines are for the most part as endearing as a Dominos delivery box, their lines as emotive as the weekend set menu.

It's a dodgy trap, to get so caught up in dressing like an epic that you forget your basic undergarments. Emperors and Assassins is unquestionably gorgeous and enigmatic, but it's useful to have heroes one can care about, all of whom are comfortably absconding from this flick.

They had built up a comlpex and well run society, although their technology seems to have concentrated on warfare and torture.  The importance of ambition, family, strength and loyalty are illustrated thoughout the movie, although the overriding element is cruelty.  The panoramas are beautiful, and the sounds of language fit right into the action, although the translations appear to be a bit stilted.  To me this was a good movie, not becasue of the plot (which I found difficult to follow), but in looking at the way these people lived and carried out thier lives, realizing that this occurred over two millenia ago.",1105920000,6,846,4.929577464788732
1348218,5,B00004STDA,"Whereas ""Hero"" chose to tell this classic story in stunning colors and in allegorical style, Kaige Chen treats the story of ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" in epic proportions with much fuller characterizations.  The story is much more complex than presented in ""Hero,"" casting the King of Qin in Shakepearean terms.  The parallel with Richard III cannot be ignored.  Gong Li is fabulous in this movie, as she plays the would-be emperor's wife, desperately seeking a peaceful solution to her husband's megalomaniacal ambitions. What is fascinating to me are all the historical allusions Kaige draws, such as the King razing Zhao, when he learns it is his birthplace.  It is also where his wife is from, resulting in a powerfully cathartic moment when she realizes the lengths that he will go to realize his ambitions.

The Assassin is fascinating character, not least of all in the way Queen Zhao is drawn to him, reminding her of the way her husband once was.  But this is a most reluctant assassin having given up his sword and choosing the life of a sandal maker.  It is through their relationship and some cunning on the part of the Prince of Han that the assassin is once again called into service.

Then there are all the substories, the intrigues being plotted behind the king's back; the relationship between the chief consul and the king's mother; the aging prime minister who has long harbored a secret from the king because of his dream to unite the kingdoms.  The film is so rich in detail with epic battle scenes, painting China in rich broad strokes.  Yet, Kaige has such a fine eye for detail and deeply nuanced sense of storytelling, giving the film such powerful impact.",1102550400,5,1686,4.7827586206896555
1348219,5,B00004STDA,"Taking place in what was once among the world's most advanced societies, ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" is a film of colossal ambition and outsized emotions, the kind of rare movie that manages that mix of grandiosity and intimacy that made the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy work so well. Despite some extremely cool battle scenes featuring stunning shots of massed armies and castle warfare, ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" is far more than just a big-budget epic a la ""The Last Samurai."" At its heart it's a story of ambition, intrigue, and double-dealing, which just goes to show you that politics hasn't changed all that much in the last two millenia or so. At the center of it all is Ying Zheng, king of Qin, who's coming perilously close to realizing his longtime goal of unifying China's remaining seven kingdoms. Ying Zheng is a magnetic personality who also happens to be a

brutal, murderous tyrant, qualities that prove all too useful in his visionary mission to build a unified Chinese empire. Like almost all government centralizers, from Lenin to Hitler to Abraham Lincoln, this guy is apparently convinced that his ends justify his means, even if the result is rivers of blood. By the middle of the movie he's having children executed and uttering the words ""kill his entire family"" way too much, making MacBeth seem like Bill Clinton by comparison. Oddly enough, the heroes of the movie turn out to be an absurdly gorgeous princess and an

ex-assassin who won't kill anybody, but their noble efforts aren't enough to stop the king on his mad quest. Ying Zheng does get a comeuppance of sorts late in the movie, when he realizes that his nation-building attempts have lost him the woman he loves while gaining him precisely nothing. Of course, by then it's a little too late for all the people that have lost their lives at the hands of his armies. But then, given the fact that human history has been one never-ending parade of hatred, bigotry, and violence, that's the sad story of our existence.",1095465600,6,2010,4.772988505747127

I understand there were glaring historical inaccuracies, but hey, it's a movie! The griping and so-and-so indignities expressed by so many people bothers me, since i've never seen a movie which so glorifies the grandeur of ancient China. All such historical things aside, I thought the characters were played very well by their prespective actors, and the character development was very good.
The only things that bothered me was the spoken language, being strangely modern and very awkward, and the sometimes jumpy and ill-done editing and cutting of scenes.",1077667200,7,812,5.206106870229007

1348222,5,B00004STDA,"To history majors familiar with ancient Chinese history, this movie is about as disappointing as Braveheart was to fans of Scottish and British history, but this film is still a very enjoyable film for those who appreciate a well-made movie when they see it.
The setting of this movie is the unification of China which occurred under the short-lived Chin Dynasty, which only lasted a couple of decades before being supplanted by the highly successful Han Dynasty, which lasted for some 400 years. The story centers around the man who believes that unification of the kingdoms is his destiny, and an assassin who is hired to kill him.
The cinematography is excellent, and the acting and character development is superb. The characters are shown as multi-faceted individuals, not the cardboard good-guy, bad-guy caricatures that populate most Hollywood movies. The character of Jing Ke, the assassin, is my favorite. He is a ruthless and efficient killer, and expert swordsman, yet shows that he is not without remorse, and mourns some of the many he has been tasked to kill. The Emperor, on the other hand, sees himself as duty- and destiny-bound to fulfill his purpose of uniting the kingdoms of China under his rule. He too, is brutal and calculating, but also shows how lonely and desolate is the seat of great power.
If you're into huge battle scenes like Braveheart, you're going to be disappointed. There are few battle scenes in this movie, but overall, this is an epic on a par with the great ones.",1059177600,9,1505,4.8828125

I am mystified and would love to find the original verson, as I believe it probably has been destroyed because of its radical, subversive take on Chinese history.  It was a beautiful, moving excellent film that mocked the Chinese government and now seems to have been ""hollywoodized"" and bears little resemblance to the original by the same name, tho' the cinematography is beautiful.  I wholeheartedly suggest that viewers try to find the original as I am trying to do, tho' i suspect it no longer exists for commercial consumption.

1348224,2,B00004STDA,"I bought this movie because I really liked Shanghai Triad (which also starred Gong Li). Unfortunately, I was disappointed - Emperor and Assassin is really more like a Shakespearean play than a movie.
By that I mean that the plot, staging, and dialogue are all very contrived. It's more like watching a very long play than a movie. You see the characters, and you can understand what's going on and why they're doing what they're doing, but the kind of emotional involvement with the characters that you get with a movie never happened for me. The characters all just seemed very one-dimensional...",1040688000,11,597,4.862745098039215
1348225,4,B00004STDA,"This is the story about the Emperor who unified China's separate provinces into one country, but it is not a celebration of that moment in history, its quite the opposite. Chen Kaige turns history into a kind of puppet show-- where there is the illusion of whats real and there is the reality behind the illusion. Unification sounds like a nice word but in order to unify all of China much violence must be done to it. This is the reality. Also the Emperor must convince people not just by force but he must make them believe it is somehow his destiny to unite China once and for all. This is yet another illusion that must be presented though the reality behind that illusion is quite another thing. I think the movie is quite good at presenting its characters as complex people and not as historical dramas often do which is present historical figures as singleminded and one dimensional. So if you come to this film expecting an exciting historical epic you might be disappointed because its more a revisionist telling of events with its focus on characters not scenes of epic grandeur.  The most famous scene in the movie has the two title characters finally face off and it is quite a memorable scene. It is a long long movie though and it takes a long long time to get there. This one is for the patient, the historical minded. Not for those in search of a battle drama. Gong Li plays a relatively small though important part. Its her character who is married to the Emperor and yet her sympathies fall to the side of the Asssassin. A small but integral part. To western audiences there are no other stars in this picture and that may have hurt this pictures reception. The actors are very good however and if you stick with it you'll be glad you did.

With his charisma, he is the personification of the intrinsic man.  While he is a king, we see that he is also human.  A man fraught with fear, with love, with hatred, with loneliness, and while intoxicated with power, he understands that he is powerless.  A wonderful performance, which shows the complexities of character and the multi-faceted id.

1348227,5,B00004STDA,"""The Emperor and the Assassin"" is drama at its finest.  Set against the backdrop of ancient China during the end of the Seven Kingdoms, it is not so much the story of how they were unified as it is about the trials and relationships of the Qin king.  Extremely long, clocking in at just over 2 hours and 40 minutes, the impatient will shift their seating more than a few times, but the experience is entirely worth it.  The crew entirely rebuilt the Qin palace, along with several other cities, from scratch.  The sets and costumes are gorgeous.  It really does appear to be ancient China.  But this is not a film that only Asians will understand, it has a universal message and story that anyone could grasp.  The acting is well on par with the best of the western world, and the story is absolutely heartbreaking.  This is not a Hollywood movie by any stretch.  This film actually takes time to develop every character intricately, and the portrayals of them really make you feel what they are feeling.  There is no happy ending, but you will not feel cheated when the credits roll.
As with any foreign film, especially Asian films, the dialogue will be best understood by those who can understand Chinese, but for the most part the subtitles are very good.  English speakers(or readers, in this case) will not miss much in the words spoken, but the true emotion can really only be felt by speakers of the language.  Chinese is simple in syntax, but extremely complex in its subtleties that just cannot be translated into subtitles.  But I am happy they chose not to dub it as that would likely destroy the brilliant performances of the very accomplished actors involved.
Anyway, in any language this is one of the greatest films EVER made, and if you like quality movies at all this film could not possibly disappoint.",1025222400,20,1821,4.635514018691588

This reminded me very much of King Lear, almost told with a degree of poetic justice about it.

There is no ""good guy"" ""bad guy"" here. Every charcters in this movie have their good...and their bad. The main power of the story is basically a man, in the beginning with honest sincerity consume by greed and powerlust in the end. Now, don't we see too many of these people around us today?
With regards to some comments before me, please note that there are movies made by Japanese directors, hated by some japanese. There are Chinese movies made by Chinese directors hated by some Chinese as well as American movies made by American directors hated by some Americans. There is no way of pleasing everyone and that, is human nature.
There are times when I fear reading movie reviews because there are the good and the bad. I for one can never decide and ending up standing in the video store for hours deciding to buy or not to buy.

I love this movie,period. Also, because it is my personal nature & character that I love epic, dramas/movies...along the realms of Seven Samurai, Dances with the wolves, Ran, Color Purple, To live, The Emperors Shadow....and so on.
Also perhaps, to be honest, I am fanatically and hardcore loyal to Asian directors like Zhang Yimou, Chen kaige, Akira Kurosawa, Hiroshi Inagaki and likes ,so then, I can be considered bias. Doesnt matter.
As for Tibet & Xinjiang, in relation to this movie...I am sorry but there is, and I don't see, the connection. Please don't go ""Armani-obsessed Gere"" on this one. It makes me sick to, everytime, see politics and finger pointing, squeezing into almost every Asian movies that grace the cinema, be it movies from Iran, China or Russia.
It will be nice and I will be extremely grateful if politically inclined critics leave us alone to the beauty of the movie screen and leave the politics to all two-faced politicians.

I first saw this film a few years ago and enjoyed it immensely, my second viewing on a lazy Sunday afternoon I was surprised about how much I really missed the first time aound. Yeah the story was the same etc etc but what really blew my mind was that I began to realize this movie, although fictional, is based on real events at an apococlyptical time of Chinese history and cultural development. There may be considerable argument about the licence the director takes with history but, I mean, if we have drag em out arguments about written history then Chinese history, that was handed down as fables, tales and songs for childern, would probably stir even the most brain dead of Chinese historians.
With some of the excellent reviews here detailing the intricacies of the plot, love story etc etc  suffice it to say that one should see this movie in the context of the historical importance on China's first unifying Emperor.

1348236,3,B00004STDA,"As I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think of how different the career paths the two most notable Fifth Generation filmmakers have taken from each other.  Whereas Zhang Yimou is progressively stripping down his films in order to focus on simple human dramas (compare the elaborate costume dramas of ""Ju Dou"" and ""Raise the Red Lantern"" to the modest docu-dramas of ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" and ""Not One Less""), Chen Kaige is building up the opulence of his in an attempt to encapsulate China's grand history.  It's no surprise then that Chen's characters are becoming less human and more iconic.  The subject for Chen this time is the unification of China (which consisted of seven warring kingdoms) under the rule of her first emperor, and as expected, the film feels like it was crammed with numerous historical tomes.  I enjoyed it for the most part but since Chen had already taken some liberties with this historical tale, I wondered whether he should have gone further and distilled from this dense and convoluted story the main conflict involving just the emperor, the assassin and their love interest.  I say this not only because this film seemed longer than its 161 minutes running time, but also because the final chapter of the story is so filled with suspense, it feels like a completely different film from the preceding four chapters that dealt with adulteries, coup d'etats, double-crosses, political intrigue, crucial secrets, etc.  And why did it seem like the three principal actors were acting in different films from different genres?  The emperor reminded me of those over-the-top actors I used to see in melodramatic Chinese operas, while the assassin brooded like Clint Eastwood's William Munny.  As for the unimaginably beautiful Gong Li, well, no complaints.  She's as eye-catching as Chen's elaborate and well-choreographed battle sequences.",991353600,5,1877,5.087947882736156

It's hard to imagine a person who has seen this movie cheering for ""Chinese national unity"" as the Communists require.""
Well, this was your own political message, please don't put it together with the movie or with Chinese people.
The movie itself is great, but the english translation can't be said in the same way. If you can't understand Chinese, the english translation won't help you understand 30% of the meanings.",981504000,4,660,5.064220183486238
1348238,4,B00004STDA,"First of all: I'm in love with Gong Li.
Second of all, the film: I was expecting an epic war film or something derivative thereof because I only knew the title and that Gong Li was in it before watching it. Well, obviously I was wrong, but nonetheless I was not dissappointed.
The Emperor and the Assassin is epic. The historic setting is a great backdrop for the plot, which more or less is very simple but very well developed.
The acting is great: I was especially amazed by Xuejian Li's performance as the King of Qin. He plays one of the most dynamic characters I've ever seen in film, and he does it very well. I could never tell if he was serious or if he wasn't, which, in this case, was good because it left an air of suspense/surprise roaming in the air.
It took a while to get things rolling, but soon after, the film definitely had my attention. Early on, the plot is a bit hard to comprehend, but soon everything falls into place.
In the end, it's a beautifully filmed cinema. The music is classically atmospheric. The characters are well developed (note: ""well"" developed, but ""amazingly greatly"" developed) and it kept my attention well.
The ending didn't ruin it, as I thought it may have. Recommended highly if you're an East Asian History fan or if you simply like drawn out storylines with a pinch of epicness.",978220800,6,1328,4.491735537190083
1348239,4,B00004STDA,"The costumes, the set, the battle scenes with cast of thousands, the production crew of this movie is first rate. A lot of viewers might think this movie as fictitious but for us who have read the Chinese history & for quick reference (please read Sterling Seagrave's offering about Overseas Chinese), you would appreciate that this movie is based on fact.  The Emperor happened to be the one & the same ruthless emperor who burned all the books & killed scholars to avoid any challenges from intellects (reminding you about Hitler?), sending his servants overseas to find the elixir of eternal life, built the Great Wall of China (reminding you about the building of Thai-Burma railway line imposed by the Japanese during the WWII?).  Of course, these issues weren't covered in the movie but mainly about three characters, Lady Zhao (played by Gong Li) & the two guys (naturally, the Emperor & the Assassin).  Initially, she devised a plot to help the Emperor Ying Zheng coming up with an excuse to invade the Yan country (which would reunite China after 550 years of constant war & power struggle).  Subsequently, she shifted her allegiance as she realised that the Emperor had changed for the worst & that her beloved Zhao country was destroyed by one & the same Emperor.  And so, she backed the assassin who had since become her lover to kill the Emperor.  The viewers would probably guess of the outcome as the Emperor died of old age rather than from assassination.  There are subplots of the sacked Prime Minister who happened to be the father of the Qin Emperor who happened to have gifted his sexually promiscious but pregant Zhao consort to the previous Qin Emperor.  The Prime Minister knew that should he planted the seed, his son would become the King of Heaven one day.  So, in a way, Emperor Ying Zheng was half Zhao.  His refusal to admit of his own pedigree was what provoked him to obliterate the Zhao country in a vengeance.  The other subplot is about the Marquis who was having an affair with the Emperor mother & planning a coup to enthrone himself the Emperor of Heaven (also implying the Emperor of a Unified China).  It all comes down to the battle of wits & only the strongest shall prevail.  Needless to say, some scenes were disturbing such as countless of patriotic Zhao children jumped to their deaths from the tower carrying their toys during the onslaught of the Qin soldiers.  Being a Chinese movie, it's a bit slow & for those that are unfamiliar with the history background, certain scenes might be confusing but after the viewers got the hang out of it, it shall be ok.  This is really the next best thing after the terracotta soldiers of Xian, and eat your heart out, Gladiators!  One point of correction though for this movie from the other reviewer is the actor who played Zing Ke, the assassion.  He is Fen Yi Zhan  (who also appeared in Farewell, My Concubine) rather than Chen Kaige, the director.  The director played the character of the sacked Prime Minister in this movie.

The king, Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian. is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of China and becoming its first Emperor.

There are subplots, and tragedy and constant high drama.  There are scenes of great beauty and of abject cruelty.  There is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space.

1348242,4,B00004STDA,"Sumptuous, stunning epic film by director Chen Kaige, who surpasses his worldwide acclaimed Farewell, My Concubine by creating a more evenly paced and densely textured film. Set in second century Asia, when seven separate kingdoms made up what is now China, it tells the story of Qin leader King Ying Zheng, whose goal it is to unify the seven kingdoms and become the first emperor of a unified China. Unfortunately, he can't help but let greed and powerlust get in the way of what starts off as civil and proper proceedings, and a Shakespearean tragedy akin to Kurosawa's Ran is born. It all starts off when the King's wife (the always captivating Gong Li) devises an expert plan: Since the Yan kingdom is one that is difficult to take over, why not release the captive Prince of Yan and send him home with the Queen as hostage so that when the Prince sends an assassin (played by Kaige himself) as retaliation for his imprisonment, King Ying Zheng will have an excuse to overtake the Yan kingdom? The Queen's wish is to avoid as much bloodshed as possible; the king makes this promise but doesn't quite keep it. Some might be a little upset by the violence in the film (there were constant groans in the theatre that I saw it in), but it is above all things a great tale of betrayal and revenge.",971740800,4,1297,4.547008547008547
1348243,5,B00004STDA,"First off, I am not by any means an expert on ancient Chinese history.  But I know enough to know that this film is historical fiction and does NOT a good history lesson make. I think the director intended this to be  fiction inspired by historical events.
This film is especially  provocative because of the director's interpretation of the Qin King  Yinzheng, later to be known as the First Emperor.  Traditionally Yinzheng  has been regarded as a bloodthirsty tyrant, until in the 1960's and 70's  Chairman Mao - who so obviously identified himself with the First Emperor -  held him up as a symbol of national unification and anti-feudal  ""progress"".  In the Deng-era the status of the First Emperor fell  into limbo, which is to say ripe for revisionism by avante-garde film  directors.  It may be more fair to interpret this film as Chen's commentary  on Mao than any piece of historical scholarship.
The Qin King Yinzheng in  this film is an ambiguous character torn between his ideals and his sense  of duty and his darker impulses for revenge and power.  He is a man who has  learned to justify every act of brutality with the end of unifying the  empire and bringing peace and prosperity to the land, and is so sincere in  his self-deceit that he is genuinely shocked as those closest to him  abandon him one by one, even as one kingdom after another falls before his  armies.  At the end of the film as the King prepares to bring yet another  kingdom to certain annihilation, the love of his life (Lady Zhao, played by  Gong Li) turns her back on him and walks out of his palace for the last  time.  The King, now alone in his cavenous audience chamber, looks toward  the sky and howls, ""King Yinzheng of Qin, have you forgotten your  ancestors' great goal of unifying the empire?""
The Qin King Yinzheng  as depicted in this film is an archtypical Faustian figure, who gains the  world but loses his soul in the process.
As a side note, it's much  easier to draw universal messages about the human condition from films like  this than any specific political messages.  You can't really go wrong  saying that the message of this film is that men and women who endeavour to  accomplish great things must be forever vigilant lest their means destroy  their ends.  But to say that the film clearly shows that ""the  unification of China is not worth the costs"" and apply the lesson to  Tibet and Xinjiang, well, that's just stretching it too far.",967420800,7,2452,4.611627906976744
1348244,4,B00004STDA,"This film has something of a split personality.  Clearly, the potential for grand military epic is right here, and the budget seemed big enough for  it, but the director also delves deep into intricate character development  and tries to fit the story into the structure of a classical Western  tragedy, to the extent of creating five ""chapters,"" which  unfortunately interferes with the natural progression of the plot.  Nonetheless, stunning sets, costumes, and the exotic allure of China in a  still  unformed and dynamic period make the 2 1/2 hours of sluggishly paced  dialogue and action bearable.
From the beginning, the atmosphere is  palpably different from more commonly known Chinese epics (e.g., The Last  Emperor).  Still centuries away from being members of a stagnant culture,  the characters here have much more obvious pizzazz, and the Qin court is  not stultifying, but bubbling with strong personalities and pervaded by an  aesthetic that is still semi-barbaric.  The king of Qin is at first a  rather likable man who is striving to unify China by conquering the six  other states who have endured many decades of struggle.  The first chapter  prepares you for a straight military epic,  with which I, as a military  history buff, would have been very happy.  But apart from brief shots of  massive army camps and a few minutes of siege operations here and there,  you get no sense at all of the course of the campaigns which are going on;  the generals are marginalized as characters.
However, the rest of the  movie is a intense personal drama that borrows from Sophocles and  Shakespeare.  The editing is rather choppy and the dialogue seems to lack  energy.  I won't reveal details, other than to say . . .  the final  confrontation, which is very well set up, falls flat by having a character  survive about 10 sword wounds, most of them to his vital organs, to speak  an anti-climactic line.  I'll stick to Kurosawa next time.",966038400,5,1951,4.895384615384615
1348245,4,B00004STDA,"I decided to watch this movie after learning that the director, Chen Kaige, made this movie to purposefully draw parallels between the first  Chinese emperor's bloody quest to gain power and unite China, and the  Communist Party's attempt to maintain its grip on China.
This movie  conveys an extremely malevolent worldview.  Innocent people are victimized  by evil people.  Those who attempt to stand in evil's way are crushed, and  evil has its way.  Every attempt to achieve values is frustrated.  Repeatedly, even resistance against evil takes the form of deliberate  suicide or self-sacrifice. Visually, the film is quite disturbing.  There  is a great deal of blood, death, and suffering, though the ratio of gore to  death is low.
I can understand why the director Chen Kaige projects this  malevolence in the movie.  He grew up during China's Cultural Revolution, a  time of moral and literal cannibalism in China.  Suggesting his view of the  current situation in China, the movie portrays a society dominated by  murder, betrayal, corruption, and wholesale indifference to human life.  Attractive promises are made and betrayed to justify destruction.  No  redeeming qualities are found in those in power.  Furthermore, the  negativity of this movie is a direct rebuke to the style of  Chinese-government made movies which show Chinese people as happy under  Communist rule.
The movie's primary political message is: China's unity  is not worth the suffering and murder accompanying it.  This directly  refers to the situation in Tibet, Xinxiang province, and Taiwan.  It's hard  to imagine a person who has seen this movie cheering for ""Chinese national  unity"" as the Communists require.
Philosophically, the primary weakness  of the movie is that it presents life as having only two alternatives: one  can live and gain power through betrayal and deceit, or one can attempt to  practice honesty and integrity, which is an honorable act of self-sacrifice  leading to failure and death.
Despite its malevolent worldview, the  movie has its virtues.  The film is visually arresting, in a way most  American movies gave up on 50 years ago. The film is intense, maintaining a  firm grip on one's attention, and creating a real emotional impact.  I  cautiously recommend this movie to people not particularly sensitive to  pictures of death, and who have an interest in China.",965952000,3,2383,5.193121693121693

THIS FILM, THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASIN, DEPICTS THE DRAMATIC  CONFLICT THAT POWER AND LOVE GENERATE, AND THE NECESSITY TO CHOOSE ONE OVER  THE OTHER, NOT BOTH. IT SHOWS HOW FAR CHINA AND ANY MONARCHIAL SYSTEM HAD  TO GO IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THIS BIND OF MAKING ONE PERSON THE ABSOLUTE  RULER, AND BY EXTENSION, THE SHAPER OF CULTURE. THE FILM IS ABOUT THE  POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING BETTER, WITHOUT THAT ""BETTER"" HAPPENING  IN  THIS INSTANCE, AND IT REACHES INTO TODAY'S CHINA, WHERE CLEARLY THE  VESTIGES OF THE OLD DYNASTIES STILL RULE WITH APPALING VIOLENCE AND  IGNORANCE OF THE REAL POWER...THAT OF THE IMAGINATION TO CREATE ITS OWN  SPACE AND MAKE ITS OWN CHOICES OUT OF THE EXPERIENCES OF ART AND  PHILOSOPHY.

AND THIS LYRIC SENSIBILITY IS VERY REAL; IT HAS  SUSTAINED CHINA FOR CENTURIES DESPITE CULTURAL REVOLUTIONS AND MAO.

1348247,1,B00004STDA,"As a Chinese who deeply love our history,I hated this movie so much. Actually,it raped our history. The period before Qing danasity is one of the most wonderful age in Chinese culture. It's not like the savage time  Chen discribed in this movie at all. For example, the assassin Jing Ke was  not a professional killer. He was a well-educated, brilliant gentleman who  wants to be a consultant to those kings. ""the emperor and the  assassin"" is a household story in China. What I-- and many other  Chineses --have read in ""Shi Ji""(a great history book written in  Han danasity)is all about wiseness(Jing Ke was a very smart man and he  tried many ways to fight with Qing),friendship(Jing and all of his dearest  friends knew that he couldn't come back but to kill king of Qing was the  only right thing to do,so when Jing took off his friend Gao , a famous  musician played a beatiful song for him and the song is about ""we knew  why you have to do this. You are the bravest man in the world. What you  gonna do is worthwile to give up your life"")and braveness. This kind of  braveness is not killer or even soldier's courage. It's from a man who was  well-educated and didn't want to kill somebody and never killed somebody  before. He decided to do it just because so many people hated to live under  Qing's cruel policy and at that time there was no other way to stop him. So  he'd rather give up his own life to try the only way. Another thing is the  plot is super stupid and inconsistent. This whole thing was from A  woman(Madam Zhao)'s silly ,childish thought? Give me a break. The king of  Qing first wanted to scare prince Yan to make him flee so he could have  some excuse (for this purpose he even told him""you'd better stay here  because your homecountry will soon become Qing's province"") and then  he just sent his army to throw prince Yan away? And, by no means director  Chen can convince me that the king of Zhao would kill all of Zhao's  children just because he didn't want them to be Qing's people and those  4,5yr olds would gladly commit suicide. Chen distorted human nature just for  a more shocking story,I dislike that. And, I must say, I don't like how  director Chen values things. In his eyes, unifying China is the most  important thing, so this is a wonderful reason for the character of king of  Qing to win so much sympathy. But I think freedom is more important than  that. After the king of Qing conqured the whole mainland of China, he burned  all of books except medical and agricultural ones and buried thousands of  scholars alive. I don't think describing him as a deeply hurted idealist  (also, having a terrible childhood !)is a good idea.very creative, though.",964915200,13,2702,4.491769547325103
1348248,4,B00004STDA,"A little history lesson.  The setting of this film is during the end of the Warring States Period in China; actually before the First Empire was established.  The main character is Ying Zheng, King of the Qin (or Ch'in)  kingdom, (which is where China gets its name from).  The Qin eventually  conquers the remaining kingdoms and forms the first Imperial Dynasty in 221  B.C.
The costumes and sets are beautiful.  I especially liked the  exterior sceens shot at real imperial palaces.  The whole atmosphere of the  film gave it an air of authenticity.
Beside the grand sets, this film is  actually a story about how people change; basically the relationship  between Ying Zheng and his childhood girlfriend Lady Zhao.  You see how  Lady Zhao's presence moderates Ying Zheng's behavior, making him a more  caring ruler.  However, after a plot devised by Lady Zhao herself to help  Ying Zheng conquer a neighboring kingdom without bloodshed, the King of  Qin's attitude changes.
Through the plan, Lady Zhao is banished from  Qin and sent to the Yan kingdom with a released prince who was held  hostage.  There she must convince the Yan rulers to send an assassin to  murder Ying Zheng.  When the assassination attempt fails, Qin will have a  public pretext to invade Yan.  Also, public knowledge of the attempt may  make the Yan king acknowledge his treachery and surrender.
In Yan, Lady  Zhao meets an ex-hitman named Jia Ke.  She spends time with him trying to  recruit him to her mission.  Ke was once the best assassin in the kingdom,  but has since reformed.  Throughout the film Ying Zheng becomes more and  more ruthless like the assassin once was, while the assassin develops into  a virtuous hero.
When Ying Zheng sees Lady Zhao during secret meetings  he seems to revert to his old benevolent ways.  Then when she leaves again,  he forgets all about her.  At the end, there is a confrontation between the  once good king and the former killer.
The film is well-acted.  The pacing  is slow, but it helps to develop the characters and the plot.  The editing  is sometimes done is a cut and paste style not seen in American movies, but  it doesn't distract you from the important scenes or images on the screen.  Remember, this isn't a Die Hard or Terminator 2 action flick.  This one  actually has a story worth watching.  Stick with it, and you will be  rewarded.",964396800,12,2370,4.733333333333333

This is a movie about power, love, war, regret,  betrayal and hate.  I'm not quite sure why it's rated R though -- no sex,  no language, and while there's a bit of violence, theres very little  blood.

It's beauty is infinite. MY only  regret is that it doesn't come with an English and a French track. The  Spanish dubbing is magnificient. I'm sure if there were more foreign movies  dubbed in Eglish, people would get used to the dubbing (like they are  everywhere else in the world), and films like The Emperor and the Assassin  would get the audience they disserve.

1348254,5,B00004STDA,"Watching the Emperor and the Assassin is like watching history come alive.  Before going into anything else about this picture, just the site of the costumes and watching the Emperors soldiers, living breathing moving terra  cotta warriors is simply awesome.  The history of ancient China leaps at  you in this film.  The pictures of Xian's Terra Cotta Warriors are famous,  but to see them alive in this film is just unbelievable.
Kaige Chen is  one of the world's greatest directors.  His previous film, Temptress Moon,  was an interesting look at the decadence of the warlord and KMT period in  Chinese history, but its his epic Farewell My Concubine that made him  famous.  If you are not familiar with Farewell My Concubine, its the  history of China from the Fall of the Dynasty system through the end of the  Cultural Revolution as seen through the eyes of two Peking Opera stars.  If  you like Chinese history, you must see Farewell My Concubine.
The Emperor  and the Assassin is a fantastic look at how the first Emperor of China came  to power and unified the various parts of China under one ruler and  Dynastic system.
Also, if anyone is not familiar with the awesome Chinese  actress Gong-li, this film is a great introduction.
Often Chinese cinema  and Hong Kong action cinema get lumped together.  This is unfortunate  because they are worlds apart.  The films of Yimou, Kaige Chen, and Gong-li  are very different from those of Jackie Chan.  Both are great, but very  different.
Watch this awesome historical epic and then I recommend  Farewell My Concubine, Raise the Red Latern, Red Sorghum, and the most  powerful of all Chinese films of late: To Live",961459200,93,1670,4.822695035460993
