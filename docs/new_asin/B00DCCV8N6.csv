8591672,5,B00DCCV8N6,"Filmed in 1948, this Mexican movie is a cinematic gem. The film is sepia toned, rather than black and white, which gives it a very old-fashioned quality. Yet, the themes touched by this film are sure to move the audiences of today, just as it did those of yesteryear.

The film takes place in Mexico and tells the story a wealthy, blond, Mexican beauty, Ana Luisa de la Fuente. She is an orphan who is taken care of by a black woman whom she calls Nana. This woman has taken care of Ana Luisa since she was little, and she adores and loves Ana Luisa as if she were her own. Unfortunately for Nana, Ana Luisa is a selfish woman, who looks down on those who are black or mulatto.

A famous Mexican singer, Jose Carlos Ruiz, who also happens to be an orphan, falls head over heels in love with the autocratic Ana Luisa at first sight. He finally proposes, and she accepts. Nana is horrified and tries to stop the wedding from going forward. She is charmed, however, by Jose Carlos, who ends up o getting his way, as Juan Carlos is as democratic as Ana Luisa is autocratic. Instead, Nana ends up telling a priest her reasons for wanting to stop the wedding from going forward.

It turns out that she is actually Ana Luisa's mother. She had an affair with Ana Luisa's father, who was white. When Ana Luisa's father saw that the child was born white with blond hair and looked like him, he decided that he would keep her and bring her up as his own. The condition was that Nana could never tell her that she was really her mother. Instead, she would be her nanny. Ana Luisa has no idea that the woman she calls Nana is her biological mother.

Though the priest counsels Nana to tell the engaged couple the truth, she refrains from doing so for fear that Juan Carlos would not marry Ana Luisa were the truth known. Shortly after the wedding, Ana Luisa gets pregnant, much to Nana's horror and dismay. Sure enough, when the baby is born, the baby is clearly not white, and Ana Luisa rejects the child, a daughter, blaming Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos is also surprised when he sees the child, and Nana finally reveals her secret and tells him the truth. The priest now counsels Juan Carlos to make believe that it is his mother who was black, to account for the child's color, as Ana Luisa has gone off the deep end over giving birth to a child who appears to be black. The priest tells him to wait until Ana Luisa learns to accept the child, and then tell her the truth about her parentage.

This sets into play years of hell on earth for all those involved in this tragic state of affairs, as Ana Luisa will simply not accept the child. The charade continues, and as the child grows up, she realizes that her mother does not seem to love her, even though her father and Nana clearly adore her. How, when, and why the issue is finally resolved makes for some very dramatic, cinematic moments.

Make no bones about it, this is a five hanky tear jerker, with fine performances by the entire cast. Is the film sentimental? Sure, but that is one of its charms. It also has some fine, period music, as an outgrowth of the role of Juan Carlos. In order to view this film, it is recommended that the viewer understand Spanish, as the film does not seem to be available with English subtitles. Movie lovers who enjoyed such films as ""Imitation of Life"" (1934), ""Imitation of Life"" (1959), and ""Pinky"" will, undoubtedly, enjoy this little known, cinematic treasure.
