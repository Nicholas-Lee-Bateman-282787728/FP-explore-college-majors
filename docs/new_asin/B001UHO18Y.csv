3798398,3,B001UHO18Y,"I have been following all of BBC's releases to blu-ray from Galapagos and Ganges, to Planet Earth and Wild China.

The photography is absolutely stunning.  In many ways, the various wildlife cameraman have found a way to out-do themselves over what they did in Planet Earth.

Who would expect to see, thousand of dragonfly's in the middles of the Kalahari.

Or how often, has anyone seen starving, hungry and bedraggled lions - King of beast.

The photography and narration by Sir David, evokes strong emotional bondings.  My significant other actually was moved to tears to see the plight of the lions waiting for the rains to bring life back to them.

The Diaries are welcome addition.  This was highly missed in the Planet Earth blu-ray edition. Please release that in the planet earth blu-ray..

In terms of photography and content.. I rate it an absolute 5.

Why do I rate it a 3 then?  Firstly.  The photography done on many of the action slowed down sequences were really really blothcy.  Anywhere there was black or dark browns, you could actually see pixelation in patches of rectangles, and you can obviously see the transistion from one frame to the other during this sequence, as you could see the vertical lines across the transistion.

The score for background music was amazing.  But again.. either a BBC oversight (or lack of sight) or plain arrogance from success after success, they release the track in Stereo only.  Why in all the technological glory not release it in full 5.1 or 6.1.

And where is 1080P!!!! again for all the technological glory.. why not release it in 1080P.  I am not saying 1080i didn't look stunning, but 1080P is what eveyone expects today.

The casing is not what I expect for a Blu-ray disc, but BBC has been shipping many of its older DVD's in such pocket cases before.

I rest my case..........",1245196800,18,1842,4.732704402515723
3798399,3,B001UHO18Y,"I pre-ordered Nature's Most Amazing Events on blu-ray a month before it came out. All of the reviews talk about how the crew used the same high def cameras as in planet earth. Being a huge planet earth fan, I was stoked for this one to come out. I had high expectations. But I have to say that it has let me down. The picture quality is excellent but the film is very jumpy. In fact in some parts it seems as though the disc is scratched. After a while of watching the jumpiness I turned up my Sony Z flat screen to 120 Mhz and it seemed to help a ton. But I am still wondering why there is so much jump and digital noise. Can anyone help me with this? But as for a sweet documentary, it is awesome. For example, the ""Salmon Run"" is one of the cooler documentaries I've seen. Overall it is a good documentary but I feel like they hurried to quickly to get it out and failed to polish it. Also, the cardboard case is kind of lame. 3 out of 5 would be pretty accurate.",1245024000,9,966,4.010362694300518
3798400,4,B001UHO18Y,"Nature's Most Amazing Events was created by the same team that produced the amazing Planet Earth series. The content of this series is excellent, and features some amazing footage of never before photographed events. The behind the scenes/making of features at the end of the episodes are fascinating. The image quality is very good, while not quite on par with Planet Earth. Sometimes the image looks a little soft, but overall it is a very fine looking program. The real disappointment comes from the audio track, which is just a basic stereo track. The audio sounds fine, and the narration comes through clear, but a track that utilizes the rear speakers would have been appreciated. This series is definitely worth picking up.",1244764800,,730,4.991803278688525
3798401,3,B001UHO18Y,"Like Planet Earth, this Nature's blu ray dvd set had fantastic shots and the narration is good. The aerial and panoramic views are spectacular. Like Planet Earth, some of the video is like sd. Overall I am giving the dvd set a 4 star rating.

Now to the lousy packaging. Well somebody had to do it again. The outside sleeve is standard cardboard with the standard information printed which is ok, but the inside container for the dvds is also cardboard, not the standard blu ray plastic container. The dvds slide in and out the slits on the cardboard container with difficulty. If you are not careful, you can scratch the dvds. Zero star rating here people; lets get with it.",1244764800,37,675,4.578512396694215
3798402,5,B001UHO18Y,"I am a huge fan of Blue Planet and Planet Earth. So when I saw this on the shelf, I snapped it up without any real thought.
I went home and put it on right away. I was blown away by the shear genius of the photography. It seriously rivals Planet Earth's photography.
It not only has amazing shots, but the stories that are told in each episode, are ones that you don't really see. It shows the life of a polar bear during an Artic Summer, the struggles a salmon endures during its upstream journey, the challenges a pride of lions face when their food migrates away from their territory, and more.
This is an amazing product that I reccomend for anyone who loves the Animal Kingdom.",1244592000,98,682,4.3359375
3798403,4,B001UHO18Y,"I have only one question about this program. Like its precursor Planet Earth, the programs are quite good and astounding. However, I am confused about one thing--the specs for Planet Earth indicate it's 1080p, but the specs for Events indicate it's 1080i. Since I'm hard pressed to see a noticeable difference on a 1080p set between the two, does anyone know for sure if this program was indeed shot at a lower resolution?",1243987200,,422,4.794520547945205
3798404,5,B001UHO18Y,"There will inevitably be comparisons between ""Nature's Most Amazing Events"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>. While I can't say that this new series is quite as groundbreaking, it is still pretty great and has some amazing footage.

As its title suggests, ""Nature's Most Amazing Events"" focuses on some of the most amazing events in the animal kingdom. I actually like the fact that each episode stays in one location (as opposed to the way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>&nbsp;jumped around the world). However, I thought it could have gone beyond Africa and North America. I also thought this series had some amazing footage of birds and whales, particularly of birds underwater. Those scenes alone make the series worth buying.

One note: I originally watched this series on the Discovery Channel. For some reason, Discovery used another narrator (Hasani Issa), not David Attenborough. As viewers of nature documentaries know, Attenborough's infectious enthusiasm makes his programs truly a joy to watch. As such, this DVD will be much better than the televised version for simply having Attenborough as the narrator.

Now, onto the episodes:

1) Arctic Summer:
This episode focuses on Arctic environments and includes many of the usual suspects, such as Polar Bears. There was a great scene with baby Gillymots learning to fly. The birds essentially jump off a huge cliff and try to land in the ocean. Many miss and bounce along the ground - but survive! This scene evoked the infamous scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>&nbsp;with the ducklings jumping out of the tree - but many times higher, with Arctic foxes waiting at the bottom to eat any unlucky baby Gillymots.

2) Grizzly Wilderness:
This episode follows the Salmon migration in the pacifc northwest - and all of the animals trying to eat them. There's some great shots of the Salmon swimming through the water. In one shot, a Salmon is swimming through a waterfall, jumps out of the water, and - in slow motion - flies toward the camera. There's also a cool scene of a dead Salmon decomposing in fast motion.

3) Surviving the Serengeti:
Unfortunately, there wasn't much new in this episode. It covers the wildebeest migration in East Africa. The wildebeest migration is certainly one of nature's most amazing events, but the Serengeti is also one of nature's most documented events.

4) Army of Predators:
This episode covers the army of predators that chase Sardines. I loved the footage of Gannets plunge-diving into the water to eat fish. The birds look like they're swimming underwater. I've seen some other documentaries trying to capture birds underwater (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Planet-Seas-of-Life/dp/B001957A4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Planet: Seas of Life</a>), but this scene was by far the best. The episode climaxes with a battle royale between Gannets, Dolphins, Fur Seals, Sharks, and Bryde's Whale all chasing the Sardines.

5) Kalahari Flood:
This episode focuses on southern Africa, with the drying up of the Okavango River in Botswana. The footage of the Termites up close looks great in HD. These scenes were even better quality than the Termite footage in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-in-the-Undergrowth/dp/B000EBD9W6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life in the Undergrowth</a>. Also lots of elephants wallowing around.

6) Pacific Feast:
This is another underwater battle royale, with Stellar Sea Lions, Orcas, and Humpback Whales all going in for some Herring. This episode includes some of the best blu-ray footage of whales I've seen, with extensive footage of Humpbacks hunting using ""bubble nets."" The ""whale song"" that the Humpbacks use while ""bubble netting"" is haunting. After watching this, it is absolutely clear that these animals are intelligent - coordinating group action, using tools (bubbles), and taking advantage of the Herrings' weaknesses. There's also a great shot of a Humpback exhaling through its blowhole and catching a rainbow on its breath. The mist from the blowhole changes colors from blue to green to yellow to red. I can't describe what it looked like other than to say it was pretty amazing. This is easily some of the best Humpback footage ever.

In short, if you enjoy nature documentaries, don't miss out on ""Nature's Most Amazing""! It has wonderful footage of birds underwater and whales. While there are some low points (notably the Serengeti), the best moments far exceed the ocean scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>.",1243728000,344,5034,6.107496463932107
3798405,4,B001UHO18Y,"Just saw this on cable.  It's truly spectacular.  The section on the Arctic summer makes you think about the consequences of global warming.

I love these videos. The work that goes into them is impressive. Each episode has a diary section where they go back and show how the film was made. It is fun to watch the lives of animals and then realize how they went about making the movie.

Sometimes the stories are sad. Watching the lion cubs perish during the dry season was sad but they have well shot nature documentaries that I enjoy tremendously.",1454889600,,443,4.390243902439025

# Firstly this is a BBC Natural History Unit production and they are famed for their authoritative presentation of the natural world.
# Secondly the photography is gorgeous and the camera angles and footage are brilliant. Whether sweeping aerial shots or underwater photography is being addressed the results are brilliant.
# The whole thing is narrated by the familiar tones of David Attenborough. Who while he is now getting quite advanced in years as I write has lost none of his passion for his work.

Lastly the reason to buy this is because it is some soul food, a real pick-me-up and way of checking out just how special this planet is. A perfect gift.... for yourself. Buy a second one for a nature lover and/or armchair traveller friend. They will thank you.",1397260800,,968,4.72189349112426

It has all this wild stuff that happens in nature. Like when sardines migrate, sharks come and these diving birds that swim and then fly again trying to get the sardines. There's also these birds that live on this ledge for a month a year to raise their new babies. Then the babies have to fly off the cliff. If they don't reach the ocean, then foxes eat them.

The good thing about this one if that it's a gripping narrative. Some nature shows are just like, ""check out this sick forest"". ""Yo isn't this a cool looking reef?"" This one tells a story of fascinating wildlife behavior.

With that out of the way, this has by far some of the best nature cinematography on film that rival's the nature series Planet Earth, Life. This series takes you to the African Serengeti, Botswana, Alaska etc. I liked the fact that this series has much more African Serengeti animal footage, than Planet Earth, and Life combined.

Planet Earth seems to focus on extreme close up shots, super slow motion play back, and other cool camera tricks while looking at animals. They do have some excellent footage of rare animals doing cool things. But Nature's Most Amazing Events is exactly as it's titled. AMAZING EVENTS. This series shows nature in its truest form, chaotic, no moral compass, and a fight for survival. I recently traveled to Alaska so the great feast episode is definitely my favorite. Getting to see a humpback whale almost swallow the camera man was incredible! Overall, I can say if you enjoyed Planet Earth I would highly recommend checking this out. If nothing else, rent it or check it out on netflix if you are unsure of purchasing. But I can say with high certainty that you will be satisfied!

So, you don't get as much bang for your buck.  Don't get me wrong, the footage/photography is literally amazing and David Attenborough is brilliant once again as narrator. There are six episodes: three based on water/ocean events and three on land.  (The Great Melt, The Great Salmon Run, The Great Migration, The Great Tide, The Great Flood, The Great Feast).

Not to mention, the HD version, the Standard Definition version, but Planet Earth's blu-ray has two versions 1080p and 1080i and within the latter version a four and a five disc version and additionally these versions are from US or UK.
BBC denies that there are two versions and claims that only 1080i version exists and 1080p was a misprint but some reviewers still believe that there is a 1080p version though BBC might have stopped producing it.

As soon as I opened the package, one of the discs fell out onto the floor.  Not a big deal for me, but you might not want to open this on the balcony of your apartment if you live on the 20th floor :-)

The BBC did what they seem to do best these days, capture amazing nature footage, in this case of some of nature's ""most amazing events"".  While I was familiar with some of the events, others I had never really learned anything about before.  But even for the ones I knew, they had some excellent new footage that makes you wonder, ""How did they get THAT shot?!""

I don't know what Turtledom is talking about. The Serengeti episode was unforgettable. The intimacy of the segments following the lion pride as its members struggled to survive the dry season was heartrending. No one has ever filmed animals like this before. You are literaly there, just a few feet away, watching these emaciated, diseased lion cubs as they strain to keep up with their pride, and against all odds rejoining their family and frolicking in the bounty of the rainy season. The shots of the grizzlies from the salmon run episode are breathtaking, watching these skinny cubs follow their mother out of the den in the snow packed mountains, then climb up and down steep grades on their way to the swelling streams below, all the while panning out from close up shots to super wide aerial views showing the bears as tiny dots in the vastness of the Alaskan wilderness. STUNNING. Then they get these super close up shots of grizzlies' fishing tactics in deep water, from above and below the surface, that no one has ever captured before. Watching how they did it in the Diaries segment at the end was just as impressive.

BBC is the best in this genre because they not only educate, they create a visual work of art that is mesmerizing in its aesthetic beauty. The zoological expertise of the people filming these animals is what sets BBC apart, creating images you have never, ever seen before.

If you like the BBC Nature productions I heartily recommend Nature's Most Amazing Events.

The blu-ray is mostly fantastic, it has a few quirks that seems to be transfer related. First, it is 1080i and not 1080p. 1080 interlaced can cause motion problems and since this production has plenty of motion it was an unwise choice on BBC's part. Secondly, two episodes, one on each disc, exhibit vertical block lines that are visible in the inky blacks of the image. It's not constantly throughout though; it occurs infrequently. The episode on the first disc where it occurs is The Great Salmon Run. I can't remember which episode it occurs on the second disc.

The photography is amazing, and I love getting the whole picture of each story instead of jumping from place to place like Planet Earth did (although that was part of what I loved about that series too, so go figure).

My only problem with this is that several times throughout the episodes the shots are blurry--almost like they weren't shot in HD.

For the price though, who can beat watching the mother seals trying to protect their babies from storms, or the humpback mother supporting her baby over their long trek, or the thousands of mating dragonflies, etc., etc. A great addition to your collection!",1269820800,,785,4.850746268656716

3798535,4,B001UHO18Y,"For a budget price, Nature's Most Amazing Events is a good buy. BBC is definitely a leader in nature cinematography and the quality of material as well as camera man work here is top notch. The episodes are not tied together and do not carry the same overarching narrative as in the other famous BBC documentary Planet Earth. And sometimes, story is centered not on the actual 'Amazing Event' but rather uses is as a background to tell a compelling story of the individual animal. This is both good and bad as the documentary definitely does not carry as much educational material as it could, sacrificing it 'to tell a good story'.
My only complaint was that the sound provided was only 2-channel stereo and rather uninspiring at that, failing to evolve you in the scenery, unwrapping in front of your eyes in gorgeous 1080i picture. This and the lack of any menus. There are unskippable 3 or 4 previews every time you start the disk and the main menu looks like it came from the DVD era - very basic and uninspiring. No pop up menus are provided. As I said - this is a budget item.",1266796800,3,1083,4.474747474747475

Second to that would have to be the episode about the Okavango.  Some of the information is a repeat from Planet Earth, but it expands even more on the subjects, which makes it even better.

David Attenborough's narration is as usual, top notch. Overall another great addition to your blu-ray nature collection.

You might think ""Nature's Most Amazing Events"" will be just another one for the DVD shelf.  You would be wrong.  This is a fantastic film that's definitely worth owning.  The film makers have done a superb job showing these regular events in a new light.  I have never seen, for example, footage of thousands of leaping dolphins on the hunt for sardines on their annual migration.  By the way, we still have an old, 27-in square-screen TV!  Imagine how even more impressive these footages would be on a plasma or LCD screen.  This film is a keeper and one we will probably revisit time and again.",1261008000,2,782,4.698529411764706

3798545,5,B001UHO18Y,"There will inevitably be comparisons between ""Nature's Most Amazing Events"" and Planet Earth. While I can't say that this new series is quite as groundbreaking, it is still pretty great and has some amazing footage.

As its title suggests, ""Nature's Most Amazing Events"" focuses on some of the most amazing events in the animal kingdom. I actually like the fact that each episode stays in one location (as opposed to the way Planet Earth jumped around the world). However, I thought it could have gone beyond Africa and North America. I also thought this series had some amazing footage of birds and whales, particularly of birds underwater. Those scenes alone make the series worth buying.

One note: I originally watched this series on the Discovery Channel. For some reason, Discovery used another narrator (Hasani Issa), not David Attenborough. As viewers of nature documentaries know, Attenborough's infectious enthusiasm makes his programs truly a joy to watch. As such, this DVD will be much better than the televised version for simply having Attenborough as the narrator.

Now, onto the episodes:

1) Arctic Summer:
This episode focuses on Arctic environments and includes many of the usual suspects, such as Polar Bears. There was a great scene with baby Gillymots learning to fly. The birds essentially jump off a huge cliff and try to land in the ocean. Many miss and bounce along the ground - but survive! This scene evoked the infamous scene in Planet Earth with the ducklings jumping out of the tree - but many times higher, with Arctic foxes waiting at the bottom to eat any unlucky baby Gillymots.

2) Grizzly Wilderness:
This episode follows the Salmon migration in the pacifc northwest - and all of the animals trying to eat them. There's some great shots of the Salmon swimming through the water. In one shot, a Salmon is swimming through a waterfall, jumps out of the water, and - in slow motion - flies toward the camera. There's also a cool scene of a dead Salmon decomposing in fast motion.

3) Surviving the Serengeti:
Unfortunately, there wasn't much new in this episode. It covers the wildebeest migration in East Africa. The wildebeest migration is certainly one of nature's most amazing events, but the Serengeti is also one of nature's most documented events.

4) Army of Predators:
This episode covers the army of predators that chase Sardines. I loved the footage of Gannets plunge-diving into the water to eat fish. The birds look like they're swimming underwater. I've seen some other documentaries trying to capture birds underwater (including Blue Planet: Seas of Life), but this scene was by far the best. The episode climaxes with a battle royale between Gannets, Dolphins, Fur Seals, Sharks, and Bryde's Whale all chasing the Sardines.

5) Kalahari Flood:
This episode focuses on southern Africa, with the drying up of the Okavango River in Botswana. The footage of the Termites up close looks great in HD. These scenes were even better quality than the Termite footage in Life in the Undergrowth. Also lots of elephants wallowing around.

6) Pacific Feast:
This is another underwater battle royale, with Stellar Sea Lions, Orcas, and Humpback Whales all going in for some Herring. This episode includes some of the best blu-ray footage of whales I've seen, with extensive footage of Humpbacks hunting using ""bubble nets."" The ""whale song"" that the Humpbacks use while ""bubble netting"" is haunting. After watching this, it is absolutely clear that these animals are intelligent - coordinating group action, using tools (bubbles), and taking advantage of the Herrings' weaknesses. There's also a great shot of a Humpback exhaling through its blowhole and catching a rainbow on its breath. The mist from the blowhole changes colors from blue to green to yellow to red. I can't describe what it looked like other than to say it was pretty amazing. This is easily some of the best Humpback footage ever.

In short, if you enjoy nature documentaries, don't miss out on ""Nature's Most Amazing""! It has wonderful footage of birds underwater and whales. While there are some low points (notably the Serengeti), the best moments far exceed the ocean scenes in Planet Earth.",1255996800,52,4203,5.017216642754663
3798546,5,B001UHO18Y,"Some past reviewers said this is a lot of old material so I was hestitant to buy it. I was glad I did! I own everything by David Attenborough but ""Life of Mammals"" (because I don't like the gory kills). I only saw a few scenes in this entire series that looked like material I'd seen before. Also, I was pleasantly suprised this series wasn't focused on the killing scenes. Great series, and can someone please consider doing the ""Joys of Animal Play"" series with some fluffy music in the background and leaving out the gross stuff!? Just think of the possiblites, animals at their happiest moments. Thanks.",1255564800,3,607,4.62962962962963

You will travel from the Arctic to British Columbia and to the Serengeti on the first disc and then back to South Africa, on to Botswana and back to the Pacific Ocean and Alaska on the 2nd disc. Not only are the events themselves amazing but the camera work is spectacular. It would be hard to overstate the work of the BBC in producing documentaries about our planet and nature. They are the best. Just as interesting as the episode itself is the 10 minute 'diary' at the end of each episode which showing clips and interviews with the camera crew filming each episode and the challenges they encountered.

Would have liked to see new events, such as the butterfly migration in America; right now, it mostly comes across as material that's been done before.

3798552,5,B001UHO18Y,"Nature's Most Amazing Events takes you on a fantastic journey from the Artic to Africa.

The Great Melt: The collection starts off in Arctic with a primary focus on Polar Bears and Guillemots. If you've seen Planet Earth, you will be familiar with the Polar Bear activities, but the Guillemots were fantastic as we see the young taking their first flight and learning how to feed.

The Great Salmon Run: This takes place in the Pacific Northwest and follows the Salmon Run and the grizzly bears that depend on it. This was my favorite episode because I really enjoyed seeing how the Salmon travel so far and often up waterfalls to get to their birthplace. I also enjoyed the bears and their fantastic fishing techniques.

The Great Migration : This takes place on the Serengeti and features the migration of the Wildebeest and their predators. A special focus is on a lion pride and their struggle to survive while waiting for the migratory animals to return.

The Great Tide: The scene follows the sardines and their predators. The scale of sardines is amazing, as is the footage of the predators devouring them.

The Great Flood: The next to last scene takes us to the Kalahari during the flood. Planet Earth viewers will be familiar with the elements in this scene, but it's nice to see different scenes as well.

The Great Feast: The scene follows the may animals that are supported by herring feasting on the plankton.
The footage of birds,sea lions, and whales is amazing. In particular, we get a close up view of the whales eating a bait ball, and the scene is stunning. It was also interesting to see the whales together doing what is called ""bubble fishing"".

Nature's Most Amazing Events is a great series, and the camera work is stunning as I have come to expect since watching Planet Earth. Some of the footage may seem familiar if you've seen Planet Earth or other nature shows, but it doesn't detract from how well these scenes were shot.

David Attenborough does a great job of narrating the series, and each scene also has a ""diary"" that takes you behind the scenes and shows you how some of the camera work is done. I thought this was a great addition and enjoyed seeing these folks in action.

Each scene is about 45 minutes long and then has a 10-15 minute diary.
