8113468,2,B000EQHXM8,"The film is an hour long documentary and re-enactments. It starts with a less than Wikipedia knowledge of Satan, presenting a spotty history, mentioning a few Bible verses in passing. If asks the question if Satan has children on Earth and assumes he does. The rest of the film goes into the lives of various serial killers who were presumed to have been conceived on a Satanic holiday, or Friday the 13th. How they knew this is not revealed.

The title of the film did nothing to reveal any meaning of the number 666 which wasn't mentioned on the film and only seen written on a woman's bare chest (some nudity).

Unless you want a crash course of a few serial killers, this hour long DVD should be avoided.",1414886400,4,708,4.48062015503876

8113472,1,B000EQHXM8,"Not about what it purports to be about. Plain and simple this doc is not about 666, not about satan or the devil and its origins beyond the ultra brief summary in the beginning. This is a documentary about notable serial killers ONLY. It should've been titled according to its subject so as not to mislead the viewer. The creators try to stretch their unsupported proclamation that these serial killers are children of Satan. No theory for believing this is the case except for using their birth dates... which if they truly wanted to be effective at the very least they would've gone in depth about each date and its meaning jn detail and the relationship the birth has to do with the method or choices of each serial killer (which i assume there really is no relation which is why they don't delve deeper into date meaning). I would give this documentary a quarter of a star if I could. Only watch this film if you are interested in the brief summaries of a few serial killers because that's all this documentary is about.",1386547200,,1024,4.54054054054054
8113473,1,B000EQHXM8,"666 Revealed (Garry and Michael Gibson, 2006)

These days, getting a movie on Netflix Instant Streaming is a ridiculously easy process; you sign up with a distributor who has a contract with Netflix, and there are vanity distributors out there just like there are vanity presses for aspiring authors, you pay them some money (the amount seems to vary between a thousand and sixteen hundred bucks), and boom, there you are. (I have no idea how much the filmmaker gets back in royalties, so don't go putting up a kickstarter just on my say-so.) The obvious huge upside to this is that it is easier to get your no-budget horror flick into the hands of as many fans of no-budget horror flicks as possible; a quick scroll through the popular on Netflix menu on any given day will show you that there one one helluva lot of no-budget horror flick fans on Netflix indeed. The downside, of course, is that anyone can do it. Lights Film School's article on the subject [[...] makes the case for Netflix working only through distributors that it helps ensure that places like iTunes and Netflix don't become digital dumping grounds. It's a laughable statement at best. Case in point: 666 Revealed, the single lowest-rated movie on Netflix Instant as I write this, and a case-study in why you should not put the documentary you produced for your charismatic Christian church up on Netflix for a wider audience to see.

666 Revealed is not the Mike-Warnke-rock-and-roll-is-eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeevil slagfest I was expecting to see (and enjoy mocking). Instead, it is a documentary, and one must use the term as loosely as possible, made by folks who have watched far too much of whatever monstrosity the former CourtTV has degenerated into, delvingor attempting to delveinto the link between Satanism and serial killers. Any sort of delving, however, fails; there's nothing in here any casual reader of serial killer nonfiction isn't already well aware of, making this at best another useless survey of the source material with a number of questionable conclusions drawn from it, and at worst a silly exploitation piece aimed at making money for whatever church backed its making. Either way, well, this is one of those flicks where I can truly say I watch these things so you don't have to. Do whatever you can to ignore that this even exists.

8113474,1,B000EQHXM8,"This ""documentary"" popped up in one of my Netflicks queues. Since it's a subject that interests me, I decided to watch it. I made it about thirty minutes in before I had to give up. The horrible production and absolute lack of any content was bad enough, but the fact that they basically arbitrarily decided that a couple of serial killers were "" the devil's offspring"" because they were conceived on ""Satanic Holidays"" .

I can't state enough how BAD this whole thing was...to be fair, mostly because I couldn't stomach sitting through more than 28 minutes of it.",1340496000,3,564,4.696969696969697
8113475,1,B000EQHXM8,"This is a meaningless documentary (?) that should be avoided by any means.
There is nothing new.
There is nothing shocking.
There is not much relevance to it at all.",1298332800,4,165,4.533333333333333
