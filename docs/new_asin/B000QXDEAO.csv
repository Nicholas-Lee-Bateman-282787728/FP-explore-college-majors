The other 30 minutes are the bonus features which comprise of extended clips from stuff used in the main documentary. It's all news and stock footage from the 60s/70s and interesting in and of itself. Yes, The Rolling Stones are featured in archival interviews and news footage but there is not one single riff of a Stones tune in the whole thing. It skims over a lot of stuff and seems to be in a hurry to reach it's conclusion. We all know the story and have seen most of the footage but it is a pleasant time killer and a nice reminder of the good old days for us jaded old hippies. The only faults I can find is that the whole thing seems rushed and also the total lack of Rolling Stones music. No pictures of album covers either so in that respect it is a little under-nourished. Still good fun... but could have been better.",1502496000,,955,4.224043715846994
8198200,4,B000QXDEAO,This was a better documentary then the million Stones documentary's out there. It has better interviews and plenty of old news footage and of course no full music tracks. Not bad!,1424995200,,179,4.806451612903226
8198201,5,B000QXDEAO,"A delight for early Stones fans! Great early coverage of what it was like back in the day
when rock was young!",1381622400,,110,4.045454545454546
8198202,5,B000QXDEAO,"Even if the Stone are not considered an elite band this
dvd differs from that logic ! There has never been and will
never be a band as strange , unreal , mystical and unreal
as the stones . Brian Jones and Bill Wyman will always
part of the stone's history in music and their impact on
world culture and history !",1372723200,,313,4.064516129032258
8198203,2,B000QXDEAO,"This DVD was VERY disappointing. It IS the entire story of the Stones from the very beginning but guess what? No Stones music AT ALL. Not one single Stones song. Just alot of generic ""rock'n'roll"" background crap. All in all rather boring and not worth the money.",1200009600,,263,4.617021276595745
