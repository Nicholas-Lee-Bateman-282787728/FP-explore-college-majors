8703131,4,B00TUKLKOQ,"First of all, the background (waves) is beautiful and so is the sound. The big con is that some postures have too many repetitions - the big pro is that she does incorporate variations of a couple of standing poses (the Warriors). I would have liked more of these (Triangle, Extended Side Angle). I am going to play this DVD for my yoga group and we'll see how the people vote.",1532563200,,377,4.323943661971831

8703136,5,B00TUKLKOQ,"I was so happy to find this particular routine on PBS and enjoyed it so much I'll be purchasing my own copy.  This routine includes a chair version of Warrior 1 and Warrior 2, which I haven't come across on any other DVD in my library of chair yoga. Given enough time easing into the positions I think it's going to loosen up my hip joints that have been practically frozen for years, I can tell a difference after 3 days. Who knows, I might graduate to standing yoga one of these days :=) It has different arm movements from my other DVDs and it's so much more fun to do something different instead of the standard moves over and over. The setting of being right on the edge of the waves is very enjoyable. Thank you so much Sarah Starr for making these wonderful exercise videos available on PBS - and Amazon!!!!",1466726400,9,814,4.3202614379084965
