2688662,4,B000KEOLUQ,I really enjoy this exercise routine. It's fast-paced and fun which means I am done with the workout before I know!,1338163200,,115,4.523809523809524
2688663,5,B000KEOLUQ,I have plantar faciitis and can't do high impact workouts. This was PERFECT for me. I can get a great calorie busting workout into a twenty minute time frame. I'm a bigger girl so I probably burn more calories than on average. It gets you sweating and having a fun time like a party. BUY this and you won't regret it if you want to tone up and lose weight.

2688664,5,B000KEOLUQ,"Absolutely great, This is the second time I have bought this same dvd, had lost the first one I bought.  This really helps, is fun and only takes 20 minutes which I do on my lunchbreak everyday at work.",1324857600,,202,4.17948717948718
2688665,5,B000KEOLUQ,I loved this workout! It gets your heart pumping and you really burn calories! I would definitely recommend this product!,1316649600,,121,5.1
2688666,5,B000KEOLUQ,"I am a huge fan of the Turbo Jam series, but this is by far my favorite workout. Chalene is such an effective motivator, 20 minutes flies by so quickly. You are able to get an effective workout within a short amount of time. There's not much kicking in this one (which I like. I hate doing kicks) but lots of punching. The music is best coordinated with the moves in this video, in my opinion.",1306886400,2,393,4.184210526315789
2688667,5,B000KEOLUQ,"I have the whole Turbo Jam series and this workout is by far my favorite. It is so much fun, the music is great and it really is a good calorie blast. I just wish it was longer.",1304640000,,177,3.6842105263157894
2688668,5,B000KEOLUQ,"I have been a FIRM user for almost 10 years.  After my pregnancy- my FIRM cardio workouts were not producing results like they used to and I was losing motivation.  My sister suggested TurboJam and I'm happy that I did!

I wanted a high-energy cardio workout that kept me moving. I also wanted it to be mostly low-impact since my knees can't handle the jumping around like they used to.  Turbo Jam does both.  I did the Learn-and-Burn for a week and then moved on to the 20-minute workout.  In two weeks, I've lost 1/2 inch on my waist!  It took me 3 months with the FIRM to do that!  I am still an avid fan of the FIRM- they are FABULOUS for toning and strengthening - but now Turbo Jam is a permanent part of my library!!",1170892800,4,723,4.188405797101449

8155892,4,B000KEOLUQ,"When I was first starting out with kickboxing, I enjoyed Turbo Jam Cardio Party, but as I became more experienced, I moved on to other things. However, I recently had the opportunity to re-acquire a used copy of the Turbo Jam set and decided to go for it (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beachbody-Turbo-Jam-5-Workouts-Dvd/dp/B00H13JKWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beachbody Turbo Jam (5 Workouts Dvd)</a>).  I definitely liked the idea of the Turbo Cardio 20 Minute Workout, as I'm often adding on cardio to my other fitness activities.

As usual, instructor Chalene Johnson is teaching in front of a large class, with Mindy and Anna-Rita showing modifications.  The 3-minute Warm-Up segment is VERY similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turbo-Jam-Cardio-Party/dp/B000LBZISM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turbo Jam Cardio Party</a>--i.e., Johnson introduces the punch and cross punches, plus she does a dynamic stretch combo which includes speedbags, arm circles, and a hamstring stretch.  The first combination segment is 3.5 minutes.  Although the combos are fun, I found Johnson's cuing to be quite poor here, especially where she includes some moves not covered in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-Burn/dp/B000LBZTC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn & Burn</a>&nbsp;DVD.  The sequence starts with front-corner uppercut, front-corner hook, add a pump with jab, and then a high-low elbow.  Johnson calls the next segment (4 minutes) the ""party train.""  It starts with jab-cross-speedbags, then adds in a back kick-front knee.

Next is the ""Turbo,"" a short (1.5 minute) higher energy, higher impact sequence (Mindy and Anna-Rita keep it low impact).  The moves here include football drills, high jogs, and low blocks.  For the 4-minute dance recovery, Johnson begins with uppercuts, moving into quick jab-crosses.  She then adds a jab-knee-back kick, repeating the entire series on both sides.  The 2-minute final stretch starts by going through some slow punches and then moves through a few quick stretches, including a hamstring stretches and side angle and triangle pose from yoga.

At first I was a bit disappointed in this routine, as it seemed SO similar to Cardio Party, yet with poor cuing.  However, the combos are fun and different, and I loved the dance recovery music (""The Roof is on Fire"").  So, in the end, I did find this to be a fun, enjoyable workout that I probably will do again when I am short on time.",1406937600,,2560,5.953551912568306

8155897,5,B000KEOLUQ,"This is my second time purchasing this DVD just because I loved it so much the first time (& I still love it). This is an amazing workout only if you commit to giving it your all because it is only 20 minutes long. If I work hard I feel it in some muscles that I really didn't know I had.
Having a busy schedule, I not only appreciate, but LOVE this Turbo Jam workout because it's straight to the point. Chalene Johnson is an amazing instructor... if I ever meet her I will thank her for making exercise FUN, doable and appealing.
Yes, I would recommend this to family, friends, & whoever else asks me how I am losing the weight ... thanks Amazon for good service!",1341532800,,664,4.1953125
