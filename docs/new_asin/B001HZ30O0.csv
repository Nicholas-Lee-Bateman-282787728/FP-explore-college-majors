3645457,5,B001HZ30O0,"As one of the actors insists, during the debate about whether God is guilty of breaking covenant with the Jews, ""we should use our reason"" when faced with insolvable questions about the existence of a god.  Seems like a good idea to me.  Reason often moves us away from mere belief and blind faith.  The same man goes farther to ask why a god would create billions of stars in the infinite universe only to concern himself with a tiny insignificent example of humanity...it seems hubris of a colossal magnitude, nevertheless most 'religious' people hold to it strongly for if god isn't concerned with humans and/or didn't create them in the first place, there seems to be no ultimate point.
There are those of us who find meaning in the life we find outselves in for a short time without concern with heaven or hell or god's existence.  A production like this one is quite valuable, educative, emotional, and intrinsically interesting for many, many reasons.",1238025600,4,958,4.787878787878788
3645458,5,B001HZ30O0,"This film definately was not what I thought it would be.  I expected a sappy, sentimental production, and was surprised with an intelligent, thought provoking discussion among prisoners in the camps of Germany.  Very well produced, very well acted, and made me sit back and think about the questions posed from a Jewish perspective.  It made me marvel at the perseverence of a people who notoriously have suffered at the hands of others, and yet, still maintain a devotion to God rivaled by few.  Makes you re-think your relationship with God, and makes you wonder, in the face of such adversity, if ones faith would be so strong, or if you would feel abandoned by your Creator.
I would recommend this to 13+, because of the graphic conversations between prisoners, but all in all, an excellent production.",1237939200,4,806,4.861313868613139
3645459,5,B001HZ30O0,"""God on Trial"" is an insightful production in the Masterpiece Contemporary series that focuses on a group of Auschwitz inmates who convene a rabbinical court that basically puts God on trial on the charge that God broke his covenant with the Chosen Ones, the sons of Abraham. There are some amazing performances here from some familiar names - Stellan Skarsgard plays a former law professor who presides over the court, Rupert Graves is Mordechai, a modern Jew who is shunned by his father [Jack Shepherd] for turning his back on the traditional Jewish ways, Dominic Cooper plays an angry young Jew who rails against God for forsaking His people, and many more memorable performances.

The arguments swing back and forth as the various individuals make their case - be it in favor of a benevolent God who imposes suffering for a greater good or against an indifferent, wrathful God. This production is first-class - the dialogue is driven by intellectual insights that compel the viewer to think about a lot of things that may cross one's mind but that one never really gives voice to - how does one reconcile a benevolent God with acts of such brutality as perpetrated during the Holocaust and since then [Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur etc], questions to do with Man's faith, the nature of God etc. I could not stop thinking about all these things long after the show ended.

The introduction to the actual court setting [in an inmates' barracks] is well done - a busload of tourists get off at Auschwitz during a tour, and as they are led from site to site, an older visitor mentions an anecdote about the time some inmates put God on trial. This then provides the setting for the flashback to the past. The ending is truly heartrending - the tourists stop to view the gas chamber and it is a somber moment - but as each tourist keeps a moment of silence, they are 'joined' by the actual inmates who were chosen for death by gassing. Their prayers to God in their final moments effectively conveys the power of faith, but it also emphasises the  horror that was the Holocaust without relying on the gruesome depictions of Nazi brutality portrayed in other movies of the genre. A compelling production that is not to be missed.",1234396800,16,2221,4.704370179948586
3645460,5,B001HZ30O0,"I am ordering this dvd for my mom when it comes out because she wants to show it to her book study group at church (Trinity Lutheran).  She taped nearly all of it (missed the beginning) and let me watch it.  I was quite critical at first (there are so many holocaust movies, dvd's, etc. out there), but once I started watching it I couldn't stop.  I am a young adult, but I have suffered severe trials, physically, mentally, and emotionally, most of which no one should have to endure at my age.  I too have asked several of the same questions that are asked in this film, wondering if God has abandoned me, and why He lets people suffer so much, the biggest example being the holocaust during WWII.  I have read several books and watched several movies about the holocaust, personal accounts of survival.  Why?  Because they inspire me to keep going, despite all of my own pain and suffering.  This film will ask the questions most people don't like to ask or talk about.  I have to question this life because I've seen too much to just accept ridiculous so-called answers.  Why was there a holocaust?  Why were so many slaughtered?  Why do so many people suffer today in their own holocausts?

3645461,5,B001HZ30O0,"I watched ""God on Trial"" on Masterpiece on November 8, 2008. I found it to be an excellent film, well written and splendidly executed. The men of the film, prisoners at Auschwitz and daily facing death, put God on trial, questioning His commitment to the Jewish people. Why have the Jews suffered so if they are truly the Chosen People and the People of the Covenant? The discussion is deep, moving and at times shattering. I was touched by this film. As a Christian and a student of the Holocaust, I found this to be an excellent film and honest discussion. I highly recommend this film.",1226793600,68,588,4.556603773584905

It asks all of the most difficult questions that we all have about this most dark time of our history has human beings - especially those trying to understand G-d in such a time.  And it doesn't end with neat answers and happily ever afters.  It isn't afraid to ask things about G-d that are usually considered unspeakable.  Neither is G-d diminished by the questions.  For those that can handle it, it is a most worthwhile endeavor to be challenged by these questions, and to seek to come up with our own answers.  The charge:  Did G-d keep His covenant or did He break the contract He made.  Excellent use of television.",1226275200,49,669,4.462809917355372

I don't want to give anything away... it's basically a whole lot of arguments about God put into a play. I say it's like a play because it's really a made-for-TV movie with no special effects, and mostly talking, and taking place within one or two rooms. Very interesting dialogue though and top notch acting. If you liked the classic film ""12 Angry Men"" you'll like this... same idea.

3645474,5,B001HZ30O0,"""Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away"" (James 4:14 KJV). The whole of mankind - past, present and future, was accursed due to the sin of Adam and Eve (See Genesis 3 KJV). Abraham was inhumanely tested by having to offer up his only Covenant Son - Isaac. And his wife Sarah, was deliberately and cruelly made to be barren - by the Lord, until the set time that she gave birth to him (Genesis 17:17 KJV). Joseph of old (Abraham's great-grandson), was brutally subjected to unwarranted beatings, prison, enslavement and servitude for 13 long, hard years. Not by satan or his demons, but because of the fact that the Lord wanted the use Joseph by placing him into a strategic position, later on in life. Why? For the salvation of the Lord's People, Israel (Genesis 37:1-45:5 KJV). Could the Lord have orchestrated Joseph's life and that specific Divine Assignment, differently? Absolutely! But then again, only the Lord knows all of the key components involved, too have used Joseph for that type of across the board salvation. Then, for 430 years this very same Lord (the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob), uses the Egyptian Pharaoh's - one right after another, too enslave His own Hebrew People. Which meant that the Ancient Israelite's were unjustly... for all those years, made to endure harsh and bitter bondage. And to add insult to injury, when Moses came back to deliver the Israelite's from their slavery and cruel misery, the Lord..., not satan or his cronies, deliberately hardened Pharaoh's heart to keep them, there (Exodus 1:1-40:38 KJV). Why? Because ""...the iniquity (sins) of the Amorites is not yet full"" (Genesis 15:16 KJV). The Amorites inhabited a portion of the Promised Land. Others argue, that the Lord kept the Israelite's in Egyptian bondage, as a sort of incubator so that the Children of Israel could multiple and grow into a Nation. A Chosen and Holy Nation, a Kingdom of Priests that would lead the Chosen People (the Ancient and present day - Israelites) in serving, magnifying and worship of the Lord. But, before they... the Jewish People, as a multitude could re-inhabit their Promised Land, they first had to grow as a unified populous and in their faith in the Lord. And, regarding the Lord's (Jewish) Prophet's? Well... again, the Lord made them suffer seemingly mercilessly at the hands of both pagan people and idolatrous royalty, as well as by His (the Lord's) own, Hebrew People. Why? To bring about His Divine Will for the Nation of Israel. For example, By the Lord's command, the Prophet Isaiah had to shamefully run around ""...naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia"" (Isaiah 20:2-3 KJV). Again, no satan or demons, involved. Next: The Prophet Daniel was made into a eunuch, so as too get into the royal courts of the pagan Babylonian King, in order to give him Godly wisdom and advice concerning the exiled and captive, Hebrew People (Daniel 1:3-21 KJV). Jeremiah the Prophet - was unimaginably restrained (by the Lord) from meeting, mating and procreating. In that, what was good for others (marriage and children), was not good for Jeremiah. He was not to have a wife or children of his own and never, would he become a grandfather and have a family or lineage from his own loins. And, as if that God-imposed inhumanity wasn't enough, poor Jeremiah would be hated by kings, people of the land and everyone would be against him (Jeremiah 1:18-19 KJV). Why? Because the Lord would make him proclaim a very unpopular prophetic mandate and the Jewish people would reject and hate him for it. In addition, he would be subjected too abject lack and poverty. Jeremiah was understandably so unhappy and miserable because of his wretched existence as opposed to life, that the Lord Himself had preordained and imposed upon him, (meaning there was nothing that he could do to change it), that he was known, as: The ""weeping, wailing and lamenting"" Prophet. So much so, that besides being the Author of 'The Book of Jeremiah', he also wrote: 'The Book of Lamentations' within the Old Testament of the Holy Bible. And, if anyone dared to complain or get angry about their predestined 'lot-in-life', then the Lord would respond by saying, ""woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay (human beings) say to Him that fashioneth it, 'What makest Thou or Thy work...'"" (Isaiah 45:9 KJV). In other words, keep your debates among yourselves and don't disrespectfully ask the Lord what He is doing. Otherwise, He will give you an answer that you won't want to hear or soon forget! Further, the Prophet Hosea had to marry a prostitute and have children with her, too show forth the spiritual adultery of the Lord's People, Israel (See the Book of Hosea). The Lord already knew that Hosea's wife would be unfaithful to him. But, made Hosea endure it, anyway. Why? To graphically illustrate that although the Children of Israel - as a Nation, were unfaithful in their spiritual devotion to the Lord, that God was still faithful to them..., as a Covenant People. And, although not a Prophet, the one that always gets me, is: The Man named - Job. Here was a God-fearing, God-worshipping man. One, who did not willfully or blatantly out of rebellion, sin against the Lord. He daily, followed all of the rules, rituals and commandments of the Lord. And, rather than protect him and keep him out of satan's hands or that of evil doer's, as unbelievable as it may sound... it was the Lord, Who handed over Job, too satan. Why? So that, aside from sparing Job's life, satan could do with him as he wished. Which included, killing all 10 of his children, destroying his house, his property, his live stock, his livelihood and wealth, plaguing his body with such hideous and painful boils, that Job had to take broken pieces of pottery and use it, in order to scrape the boils off of his body. Preacher's, there's a sermon or two, within that statement. And, on top of that, he had three so-called... friends, that kept insisting that Job must have committed some terrible sin, otherwise he wouldn't be suffering, so much. (See the Book of Job 1-42 KJV). And, when Job complained, as too why all of this death and destruction was happening to him, the Lord - Who was acutely aware of Jobs' situation and of the chaos and havoc that satan was perpetrating against him, had this to say to Job: ""Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth? Declare (tell Me...), if thou hast understanding"" (Job 38:4 KJV). Meaning: Poor, innocent and unsuspecting - Job, who through no fault of his own, was suffering because of what the Lord had allowed satan to do to him..., received a stern rebuke from the Lord. As if Job was supposed too comprehend the spiritual gambling that was going on between the Lord and satan? Of which - Job, was the unknowing, human pawn. No, the Lord was not the One who actually harmed Job and killed all 10 of his children, struck him with boils and made him lose everything that he had. But, in a Court of Law, the Lord was an accomplice to the numerous and unwarranted crimes that were needlessly perpetrated against an innocent man. And, as harsh as that may seem, that portion of Holy Scripture, is something that most Christians do not want too address. Particularly, the reality of the situation, as it really was. Because, according to 'The Book of Job' conveniently located within the Old Testament of the Holy Bible, that is exactly how it is written, like it or not. So, can the Lord be sadistically cruel in what He Himself does or allows others to do, even too innocent people? Yes. Because He is both the Blessor and Curser of mankind (See Deuteronomy 28 KJV). Also, it must be remembered, that although ""God is love"" (I John 4:8 KJV), the Lord is also a God - Who hates (Proverbs 6:16 KJV), and He is a ""jealous God"" (Exodus 20:5 KJV), and a vengeful One, too (Romans 12:19 & Hebrews 10:30 KJV). Clearly, the Lord is passionately emotional. So, does this all-knowing and powerful God select individuals to suffer, so that He can exact Glory for Himself and have more souls enter His Kingdom at their expense? Absolutely! Besides the martyred Apostles which Christ the Lord - Himself chose, the Apostle Paul is an example. For, the Lord Himself, said: ""...He (Paul) is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My Name before the Gentiles (everyone that is not Jewish), and kings, and the Children of Israel: For I (the Lord) will show him great things he must suffer for My Name's sake"" (Acts 9:15-16 KJV). And, like the Prophets who suffered before him, the Apostle Paul was a Jewish man ""...a Pharisee, and the son of a Pharisee"" (Acts 23:6 KJV) and a learned scholar..., who studied under the renowned Jewish Rabbi, a Teacher of The Torah, the Talmud and The Law: Gamaliel (Acts 5:34-39 KJV). Fast forward to World War II (1941-1945). The Lord loves His chosen People - Israel, but it's anyone's guess why He allowed the horrific mass extermination of the Jewish People, almost to the point of National annihilation. How? By way of incineration within the demonic, Hitler ""Death Camp's."" Perhaps..., just perhaps, all this was happening because so very long ago, God the Father heard the Jewish People crying out to the Roman Governor - Pontius Pilate, that they preferred the criminal - Barabbas (a Jewish man) to be released to them. Rather than His Only Begotten Son - Jesus (another Jewish Man). And, in their rejection of Him (Jesus), they knowingly placed a curse upon themselves and their descendants. ""Then answered all the (Jewish) people, (in answer to Pontius Pilate) and said, 'His (Jesus') blood be on us, and on our children'. Then (Pilate) released he Barabbas unto them (the Jewish People): And when he  had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified"" (Matthew 27:25-26 KJV). And so, this powerful and unique film - GOD ON TRIAL, depicts the soon to be victims... having set up a make shift, Tribunal Court among themselves with the objective of putting GOD ON TRIAL, made these understandable comments and asked these valid questions: ""If we take happiness from God's Hand, are we not to take suffering, too?"" Are we tortured and purified by suffering? Is God not good? Is God not love? Then, why are we suffering? Is suffering a privilege? A part of God's plan? God is indifferent. Ask the Man named, Job! Why doesn't God send the Angel of Death to our enemies? Why the wholesale slaughter and annihilation? Did He (the Lord) violate His Covenant? Has He forsaken the Jewish People and made a Covenant with someone else? Is God guilty of a breach of contract? Are we (the Jewish People) being tested for our faith? What crime would justify such horror?!"" These are just some of the direct quotes from this deeply moving yet disturbing film. WGBH Boston Video proudly presents this 2008, color, single-disc, 86-minute, DVD release of a Masterpiece Public Broadcasting Program. This compelling depiction painfully portrays, innocent Jewish men who are Prisoners of War (P.O.W.'s) at a Nazi Concentration Camp in Auschwitz, Poland during the Second World War. Who, are needlessly facing extermination simply because they are Jewish. They decide to bide their time by putting GOD ON TRIAL. With the prisoners having taken sides, the Defense and Prosecuting Attorney's... for and against the Lord - the GOD ON TRIAL, proceed to present their opening arguments and verbal commentaries as their evidence, before the assembly. With the Honorable Rabbi as the presiding Judge. ""Hear ye, hear ye, this Court is now in session!"" The main objective? To find out whether the God of Heaven and Earth, is benevolent or not. And, too further determine if He is guilty or not guilty, for all that the Jewish People have endured during the War. Within this sobering, thought provoking and respectful trial, many sincere questions are asked... seemingly, of an indifferent God. But, as knowledgeable as the Jewish People are particularly of the Torah (the First Five Books of the Holy Bible, as well as the rest of the Old Testament Scriptures), there is a point even among the most learned of academics, where the intellect of man fails... and cannot comprehend the complexities of God, His universe and human life, in general. That is why, two of the prisoner's appropriately, pointed out: That ""...we cannot fathom His (God's) way's"" nor ""...can we know the mind of God because of His Greatness."" ""For all (of mankind) is free to choose to love God or hate Him!"" This mesmerizing and graphic movie will reach into your heart and definitely pull on some emotions, evoke some thoughts and perhaps, surface some long suppressed questions that you, yourself, may have privately asked of the Lord. But, as a first-time viewer of this GOD ON TRIAL - DVD, you will gasp at the straight forward integrity of this courageous and brilliant film. And, you will be astounded by the audacity of the tough questions, reactions and answers that are brought up. So much so, that you will feel the need to watch it, more than once. If anything, to let it sink in and make sure that you heard it right, the first time around. So, what's the verdict for the GOD ON TRIAL? Watch and see. And, decide for yourself, if you agree? A captivating, powerful and hard-hitting, movie. Definitely a 'one-of-a-kind' film, that is worthy of your viewing time. A sobering keeper. Nina Kish",1429142400,,13539,4.76618398637138

For me, faced with such, our choice is to act with integrity and honor despite everything.  To hold on to our Core Self even when dying and watching our friends and family die.  That, of course, presupposes some self knowledge operating before the evil event.  So many were completely blindsided by this evil, and rightfully so.  Who can believe this happening?  Ever.  Have we learned from this time?  Have we faced the evil in our own heart?  One can only try.

3645487,5,B001HZ30O0,"This is one excellent film.  For as many movies I've seen with the holocaust as its backdrop, never has the accusing finger pointed at anyone but Hitler and his Nazis until now. In 'God on Trial' the accusation is very real; did God breach the covenant contract he'd established with the peoples of Judaism through Abraham?  The question is being posed and challenged by Auschwitz inmates, many of whom are only hours away from the gas chamber and know it.  It truly is the trial of the century and the actors deliver the arguments for and against with stunning passion.

For some reason I'm reminded of the story 'The Devil and Daniel Webster,' where a famous lawyer battles the devil in court over the soul of a mortal and fellow citizen of New Hampshire.

'God on Trial' is a history lesson on the Jews as a chosen people, as well as an overall lesson on what is God. Seeing Jews both accuse and defend their God has never been seen with such raw passion.  To say more might spoil it for those who've yet to see it.  I urge anyone who's ever questioned God's grace and wrath to watch this gem.

Its good to have movies; other things, too; so that we do not forget.  ""The Pianist"" (2002) the story of yet one more talented individual who was targeted by the Nazis because of his gifts; ""Life is Beautiful"" (1998), a movie about a talented comedian who was also a Hebrew, who was targeted because of his gifts.

A group of prisoners decide they are going to hold a trial for the person they feel is most responsible for their misery: God. At first the charge was murder, but eventually they decided on breach of covenant. There are both accusers and defenders, including some very scholarly arguments, some very poignant testimony, and eventually a decision by the court.

3645498,5,B001HZ30O0,"This video, based on Elie Wiesel's TRIAL OF GOD, explores the painful question of God's goodness and loyalty to covenant in the context of a concentration camp.  The disputants try out both traditional biblical theodicies (such as that God has some larger good purpose in mind) and larger general arguments such as appeals to the beauty of the universe.  The prosecutor's summation speech reviews biblical history, arguing that even in such classic stories as the Exodus, God was not good but merely powerful and ""on our side.""  (As one example, why would a good God kill Egypt's livestock, children, and soldiers rather than the recalcitrant Pharaoh who is making the decisions?) But when the guards come to take selected prisoners off for execution, those who have just declared God guilty begin to pray (Ps 90).

This video, while wrenching in its depiction of the suffering humans inflict on one another, does not solve the question of God's involvement in suffering.  Those who have given up on biblical religion will be outraged that the inmates pray at the end, while many of those who still adhere to biblical religion will find the prosecutor's description of the biblical God disturbing.  The question of suffering, however, is one we OUGHT to be disturbed by, and the movie presents it compellingly, even if it doesn't provide an answer.",1314576000,2,1348,4.995535714285714

The movie is set as a many-sided socratic dialog and it evaluates the problem of evil from the point of view of the Old-Testament. I enjoyed watching it at an intellectual level but it is also one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. No graphic violence or gore, though. Just point blank argument vs counter argument, by which a roomful of Jewish concentration camp prisoners try to determine if God should be blamed for the whirlwind of horror, suffering and death surrounding them.

However, the movie is not at all just dry, abstract reasoning. It is emotionally provoking (to almost a traumatizing degree) and full of moving scenes and twists where the actors perform brilliantly and quite believably.

My only critical comment is that for some reason, the publishers of this DVD chose to market it as a ""MASTERPIECE"" and added a 4 minute footage to the beginning and the end of the original movie. In the extra footage, a young well groomed man with a smile as big as the Titanic lectures about how deep and masterful the whole movie is. This pompous packaging creates almost a comical contrast with the dark, realistic and modest outlook of the movie. I would recommend that the viewers skip the extra footage. When I watched the movie for the first time, I watched the extra footage unknowingly and I think it was detrimental to my overall viewing experience.

How does a good God allow horrors to occur to the innocent? These questions have been asked and re-asked for millennia, but have a recent hearing in ""God on Trial."" This superbly-written and wonderfully-acted film throws Jews of all kinds - scholars, rabbis, glove-makers and workmen -- into the crucible of senseless evil. The men are the pious and the fallen away -- even some whose Jewishness was a unknown to them. Under threat of imminent death, they put God on trial. They run through every understanding of suffering. It is payment for sins, it is a sacrifice for a greater good, it is a purifying fire, it is pointless. Plus a few more.

However ... the ""judge"" at the trial must constantly remind the participants that the issue is the COVENANT, and whether God broke it.
As I understand the Covenant, God's keeping it was dependent on the Israelites' keeping it. Over and over throughout the Torah and the Prophets, we are presented with the Israelites' lack of faithfulness, as early as their grumbling in the wilderness and their worshiping of the Golden Calf.
The movie barely mentions the Israelites' breaking the Covenant, which I felt was a serious flaw. Such a relevant issue should never be omitted from a ""trial"" of God's keeping or not keeping the Covenant.",1268438400,17,793,5.015151515151516
3645507,5,B001HZ30O0,"This outstanding PBS Masterpiece Theater film recreates what was possibly an actual event that took place at Auschwitz. Some of the prisoners, including a group of new arrivals still in shock, were discussing (not unlike the debate Job and his friends had) whether God had broken His covenant with them as His chosen people by allowing them to be exterminated by the Nazis. They decided the only way to decide was to put God on trial. A panel of three 'judges' was selected, one of whom actually taught criminal law in real life. . What follows is a passionate discussion of whether God has abandoned His people and, therefore, is guilty of the atrocities happening there. The discussion is well reasoned and intelligent. How can a loving God allow this evil, especially with those He is supposed to have such a special relationship with? You may find yourself asking the same questions. How is this possible? What kind of God would allow this? A father and son, one slated to die the next day, vigorously disagree. It's one thing to talk about evil in the abstract. It's quite another to talk about when you are facing the death sentence the next day. You may be surprised at which one defends God and why. The debate is vigorous and stimulating. You may be surprised at the 'verdict'. For many people, this is the ultimate question. How do we deal with evil and a loving God? The acting is terrific and realistic.

Many of the popular questions during a situation like this are addressed but as others have said, not fully answered. The only ""flaw"" I found was that their seemed to be the underlying assumption among those  involved in the ""trial"" that mankind, many at least, are ""innocent"", therefore God is guilty. They keep quoting the Torah about this and that and the Covenant while ignoring the parts that declare all of mankind guilty before God. No, that doesn't satisfy all of the gnawing questions that this movie brings up, but I do think that it brings it a little more into focus. Of course the answer to the guilt of mankind is Jesus Christ. Here is where God displays His greatest mercy and justice. But of course, this being a Jewish based movie this solution does not appear.

After all, did not God create this world and all the people in it, including the ""Chosen People"" the Jews--the people most especially dear to him?
