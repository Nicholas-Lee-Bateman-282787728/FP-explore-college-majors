8618809,5,B00FW6AZWA,"I'm writing this primarily to clear up the confusion among other reviews here of Kagemusha. Reviews complaining about the quality of the DVD transfer would appear to be of the earlier release of this film on DVD (or even on VHS). This is a review of the latest region 2 PAL version of the 162m international print released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in February, 2013 and I want to emphasize there is nothing wrong with the quality here at all. The image is full frame (16:9) with English subtitles properly letter-boxed. Potential buyers put off by said DVD inferiority need hesitate no longer. Those wanting the 179m Japanese domestic print should go for the region 1 NTSC Criterion version. Personally I see no point in going for the longer version in an already overlong picture especially when Akira Kurosawa himself cut the international print making them both 'director's cuts'.

So what about the film itself? It certainly looks fabulous with colors well saturated and Kurosawa's fabled use of the wide screen splendidly brought out. The premise in the story is highly promising with it's theme of doubling (the differences between reality and appearances) being one that resonates strongly down Kurosawa's long career from the doctor/gangster in Drunken Angel (1948) and the detective/murderer in Stray Dog (1949) right through to the kidnapper/industrialist in High and Low (1962). However, where those three wonderful films use mirror-imaging and doubling to probe us towards wider metaphysical philosophical debate and have the depth of Dostoyevsky embedded in their structures, Kagemusha offers the theme entirely (and simplistically) on its own terms. The theme is baldly stated in the opening 6 minute discussion with a double (actually a thief) set to 'become' Lord Shingen in the event of the Lord's death to make people think their leader is still alive during a 16th century war. After much repetition (both visual and in the dialog) this happens. The very obviousness of the theme leaves the audience with nothing to take in except a marvelous series of cinematic images which (while impressive in themselves) cannot mask the hollowness of the film's nature. Time and again promising scenes collapse into simplistic spectacle which overwhelms everything else. The film's lack of intellectual rigor is highlighted by the paucity of characterization. A simple comparison with Seven Samurai (1954) illustrates my point. In that film each samurai warrior is clearly drawn so that when they fight and die we care and are deeply moved. This draws us in to that film's debate on the meaning of existence. On one hand are the peasant farmers who are struggling day by day to survive honorably. On the other are the bandits who survive dishonorably, while in the middle is the samurai code which exists as a possible solution to society's problems, with the Toshiro Mifune character representing a bridge of hope - an example other peasants can adopt to fight back. The film is a glorious, visceral and savagely realistic canvas which juxtaposes mighty themes through Kurosawa's uncanny knack of fleshing out his characters. In Kagemusha we learn little about any of the characters (even the eponymous ""shadow"" of the title) so that the numerous tableaux vivant impress as spectacle, but leave our hearts untouched.

Living in Japan as I do I can tell you there isn't much to Kagemusha that stands out from the rut of usual jidai geki TV dramas. Of course, this being Kurosawa one does respond to the occasional flair of his cinematic vision like in the dream sequence when the double breaks out of a funeral urn and foresees his own future death and in the final battle scene with numerous shots of horses on their backs, legs flailing in hopelessness, but the achievements are purely visual and the film sags badly in the middle with much obscure running around in battlescenes fought in near darkness - to hide the lack of funds perhaps? In Kurosawa's best films (pretty much everything from 1948 through to 1962, especially Rashomon (1951), Ikiru (1952) and Seven Samurai) we are moved because tragic themes emerge naturally from the script, the acting and the extraordinarily vital direction. Everything feels so organic. With his lesser efforts he waxes into over-manipulation of the audience's emotions (in this case the crude use of over-emphatic music to make us 'feel' for characters we barely know let alone care about) and sentimentality. Kagemusha escapes this second charge as it constitutes one of his darkest, most nihilistic visions completely absent of hope. It's all very impressive in a way, but quite why the Cannes jury gave Kagemusha a prize is hard to say. The prize looks more like a 'welcome back' from years in the critical wilderness than an award for artistic merit intrinsic in the picture itself. Posterity has shown that Kurosawa made his triumphant return to jidai geki with Ran (1985), not with Kagemusha. As in Throne of Blood (1957) and The Bad Sleep Well (1960) it is the presence of Shakespeare which provides the intellectual rigor which the present film so obviously lacks.

I wouldn't be so harsh on the film if it hadn't have been made by Kurosawa. It's just that with such a great director anything less than his formidable best comes as a disappointment. Nevertheless, obviously those interested in him shouldn't hesitate to snap this DVD up. It may be low quality Kurosawa, but most lesser directors would die to make something as good as this.",1411430400,,5512,5.0350492880613364
