2862735,3,B000R9AKKE,"Very intense read about the Marines at Tarawa. Despite their incredible losses, the took the atoll in three days with incredible hardships faced as they had to disembark the amtracks in deep water and wade over 200 yards of withering Japanese machine guns to reach the sea wall. Good read about the magnificent Marines who basically won the war in the Pacific.

2862739,4,B000R9AKKE,A Great film especially because it's actual combat footage. I say it's great despite some issues with the edit. This film was made so the Marines would be able to learn from thier mistakes and it provides ample footage for them to learn. It won an Academy award ( the only one won by one our services) for the protrayal of the Marines in action and I believe it deserved it. It's only 40 or so minutes but it does provide graphic details of the fight for Tarawa. I highly recomment this to any peson interested in the Pacific War... You will not be dispointed especially the Prime members that can stream it for free.,1427155200,2,617,4.373913043478261

2862744,5,B000R9AKKE,I never knew this series of WWII information existed! I have found many books about the subject but the films have enlighten me even more about the trials & tribulations our country and especially the young men went through to win the war in the Pacific.,1403481600,,254,4.543478260869565
2862745,4,B000R9AKKE,"after watching this obvious propaganda film I was stunned by the pictures of dead marines that the government allowed, call it a wake up call for the homefront..The follow up segment on the Invasion of Quam was more personal for me having been in the hospital at Agana during the Vietnam war I know those people appreciated our 1200 lives lost to regain the island having been there during Liberation day ceremonies.

2862747,5,B000R9AKKE,It deserves 5 stars.  I liked everything about the DVD. It covered the entire battle from beginning to end. I would recommend it.,1392422400,,129,4.608695652173913
2862748,3,B000R9AKKE,"Gets right to the heart of being a marine.  I could see the audience standing at it's feet cheering.  I'm sure the floating dead American bodies were a real shocker in those days.  It's hard to rate this documentary(?) objectively because it was a film that was in the moment.
Now days it would be considered racist and full of half truths and distractions but in this country at that time it was probably a heartbreaker that brought cheers every time one of those ""dirty Japs"" was killed.  Having lived for several years in Japan, I had to stand back and consider the situation because of the movies' portrayal of the Japanese.  I was raised in the military so I understand their point of view and it really isn't that much different from how we portrayed the Russians during the Cold War, the Vietnamese and more recently, the Chinese who are now our best buddies.  Times change, standards change, let's hope all the dead soldiers, American and Japanese, did not die in vain.  It's a keeper",1392076800,6,992,4.6022727272727275
2862749,4,B000R9AKKE,The beach landing at Tarawa was always presented to me as a controversy and this documentary cleared up most of the questions I had on the landing.  Very good documentary.,1391472000,2,171,4.7
2862750,4,B000R9AKKE,The invasion they filmed was one of the most violent of all of them.  They captured the action at great risk to themselves.  I think it does the Marines they filmed justice also.,1386979200,6,178,4.363636363636363
2862751,4,B000R9AKKE,"Part one of this documentary gives a vivid account of the US Marines invasion of Tarawa. The narration is reasonably accurate and well presented. The production date is 1944 and has been edited for public viewing. Not a typical propaganda production and certainly worth the time. Recommended for those who want a quick overview and for those who are serious students of WWII and the Pacific Theater of War. Definitely interesting!

Part two gives a well presented, well narrated view of the return of US forces to Guam. For more than two and a half years the Japanese had controlled the native population by terror and torture. An idyllic island that became a nightmare for the residents. Guam was intended to become a Japanese settlement. Listen to the only survivor of the original military garrison as he recounts his story. Interesting, reasonably accurate, this is recommended for beginners and military history buffs. Intended as a propaganda documentary . . . edited for public viewing (black & white footage).

This two part documentary is worth viewing!

2862752,5,B000R9AKKE,"The picture was shocking for its time.  It was one of the first real attempts to show the public what war actually looks like.  Since then, we have become inured to graphic, special-effects violence and the occasional photographs from journalists in war zones.  But this wasn't fake.  A special detachment of combat photographers commanded by the actor, Louis Hayward then a captain in the Marines, went ashore in the first wave.  The photographers suffered heavy loses themselves while they did their work, most were killed or wounded.  Hayward himself later suffered a nervous breakdown from what today we would call PTSD.  The film they shot was so violent and graphic that much had to be cut.  Even the expurgated version was so controversial that  FDR had to personally order it to be shown.  A woman in the Ken Burns film, The War, described seeing it with the words, ""we were overcome"".

It has flaws, for instance, it doesn't mention that the initial landing was based on tide charts that were wrong and forced Marines to wade long distances under enemy fire when their landing craft got hung up on a reef.  But it was still a notable effort.",1372204800,,1150,4.752525252525253
