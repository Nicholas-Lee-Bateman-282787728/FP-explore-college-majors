8328031,1,B001NXC05Q,"Really didn't depict the ""journey"" to Machu Picchu.  Mainly just a short home movie of city dwellers on a day trip.",1458345600,,115,4.476190476190476
8328032,1,B001NXC05Q,This DVD was worse than watching someones home video! If we hadn't paid for this we would have threw it away.,1374019200,,109,4.238095238095238
8328033,1,B001NXC05Q,"Utterly amateurish home video of a bunch of middle-aged people bumbling along on a trip without knowing anything more than you do about the places they are visiting. The narrator is obviously reading from a script, pausing before every Spanish word and name, mispronouncing everything that could possibly be mispronounced, and giving completely erroneous translations of even well-known names. They translate Machu Picchu as ""Manly Mountain"" and Haynu Picchu as ""Wind Mountain"" when it is common knowledge that they mean ""Old Mountain"" and ""Young Mountain"" respectively. There is no attempt to prepare you for the trip or give you tips or recommend certain places. They are simply tugging you along on their journey, boring you with their amateur photography and lack of insight. You will learn NOTHING from this video so do not waste your money. Even if you can borrow it free from the library, as I did, don't bother. It will still be a waste of time. Worst travel video I've ever seen.",1316908800,,988,4.993939393939394
8328034,3,B001NXC05Q,"I was surprised to discover that this is actually a personal travel video.  When I paid the $20 I was expecting a professionally produced informational video of the Sacred Valley.  Although the viewpoint is interesting, especially the climb to Huayna Picchu which was breathtaking, the ""home-made"" quality of the video and some of the audio information was disappointing.  The indigenous tribal dances were interesting, but overly long and with little descriptive explanation. Many of the words (Spanish or Quechua) were mispronounced and mis-translated.  I was hoping to use this video for Spanish classes' education, but will have to prep the classes with disclaimers about certain aspects.  If I had known it was home-made (again, although it is a decent home-made video) I probably would not have paid the $20 price.  $10 would have been more reasonable.",1231545600,2,858,5.272058823529412
