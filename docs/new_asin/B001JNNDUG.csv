3658803,5,B001JNNDUG,If you are an avid western fan you will find this a great movie with plenty of action.  I put in the same slot as McKenna's Gold we will definitely watch it again.  Good for all the family.,1265068800,5,189,3.9473684210526314
3658804,2,B001JNNDUG,I bought this as gift for my husband - because he loves westerns and I love Trent Willmon! It was corny as could be! Mel Tillis had some great lines that made you laugh out loud!,1265068800,,178,3.9722222222222223
3658805,5,B001JNNDUG,"Great to see a movie that is ""just old fashion fun"" again. Has a great cast of favorite people. Wish we had more of these kinds of movies to watch these days.... totally enjoyed it and will watch it over and over as the years go bye.",1244764800,,233,3.978723404255319
3658806,5,B001JNNDUG,"Incredible movie set,story , and acting. I have told all my friends not to miss it. One freind saw it at the Branson Meadows theater in Branson, Missouri. He said it was the best western he has seen since Unforgiven!",1236729600,,216,4.425
3658807,4,B001JNNDUG,"There are few nostalgic moments anymore, or maybe it just seems that way as I get older, so when icons of my youth reunite I take notice.  Roy Clark and Mel Tillis stage together in this fun little film and they make the most of the reunion.  Palo Pinto Gold is an enjoyable western, not always perfect, but always fun and very watchable.  The cameo by Kinky Friedman is just icing on the cake.  This is a film to be enjoyed by the whole family.",1228348800,5,445,4.2
3658808,5,B001JNNDUG,"While the ""Bee-Hive Studios"" (Republic, Monogram and American International, among others) no longer exist, every once in awhile an independent film comes along that captures the wonderful nostalgic essence of the old ""B Movie."" What fun -- especially if it is a Western.

I was lucky enough to see PALO PINTO GOLD at a special pre-release benefit screening in Tulsa when Roy Clark was inducted into the Oklahoma Walk of Fame. Roy, along with sidekick Mel Tillis, form the storytelling geezers behind this terrific rock 'em, sock 'em Western reminiscent of those I grew up loving in the late 1940s and 1950s. If you enjoyed the exploits of Hopalong Cassidy, Hoot Gibson, Johnny Mack Brown, Tim McCoy and, especially, the young John Wayne back in his early days at Republic Studios, then you will certainly appreciate the throw-back black hat, white hat antics of Roy, Mel, newcomers Trent Willmon, Anthony Henslee, Glynn Praesel, Joanna Goode and Kinky Friedman (as the Governor of Texas no less).

Great fun for the whole family -- this film is rated PG-13 -- and a nicely done homage to the low-budget films from the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1228003200,3,1143,4.917098445595855
3658809,5,B001JNNDUG,"The following review was written by Bob Polunsky for the Primetime Newspaper Syndicate after he attended a special preview screening in San Antonio.  It is the only professionally-written review as of this date -- November 28, 2008.

""Palo Pinto Gold"" follows the old-fashioned traditions of western movies when bad guys wore black hats and scowled while good guys wore white hats and looked stern even when they smiled. True to form, the movie reminds us that gunfire was always more meaningful than dialogue in movie westerns. The storyline is reminiscent of western movie classics (one of the characters is even named ""Shane""), and the dialogue is short and sweet so it doesn't distract anyone from hearing about the historic gunfight a reporter asks about.

At the same time, ""Palo Pinto Gold"" coins a phrase that's bound to be used again by sheriffs, deputies and other do-gooders in future westerns. When one character asks another what they should do about the bad guys, his answer is ""cuff `em, club `em or shoot `em""! It sounds like something John Wayne might have said, or, at the very least, wished he had said in one of his westerns.

The movie was filmed at the Enchanted Spring Ranch in Boerne and boasts a cast of popular pros (Roy Clark, Mel Tillis); cameo appearances by San Antonio TV talk show hostesses Shelley Miles and Leslie Bohl Jones; a spirited performance from actress Joanna Goode as the leading lady named Kayla and a memorable appearance by Texas' own Kinky Friedman as the Texas governor. He grins broadly when another character tells him he should run for president. (""Me president? Well, why the hell not!"")

The plot has traces of just about all westerns inspired by the gunfight at the OK Corral as well as a slapstick tribute to ""Blazing Saddles"" that parodies its most famous scene. The bad guys are easily identified. They are the most ornery-looking varmints that ever rode a horse through the Texas frontier.

The film is told in flashbacks when a reporter (Rodney Lay) from Austin tries to get the ""real story"" behind the most famous shootout in Palo Pinto from two whisky-guzzling old timers (Clark and Tillis). They oblige him as long as he keeps the bartender coming with re-fills while they trace the origin and after-math of that shoot-out, interrupting each other from time to time to make a plot point and get a laugh to add a personal touch to the dialogue. The punch line ending itself is a surprise you won't expect.

The movie has violence, but no more than a John Wayne western. Scenes of a budding romance between bashful Jake (Trent Willmon) and feisty Kayla (Joanna Good) give us characters to cheer. Western music on the soundtrack maintains the film's pace in scenes between gunfights and fistfights. Most of the characters are stereotypes, but so are western movies themselves. ""Palo Pinto Gold"" is like westerns audiences fondly remember as ""family entertainment"".

Studio rating: PG-13

3658810,4,B001JNNDUG,"Two old timers are telling the old time shot out tale.
So this is a long term story of two generations of men
in the Palo Pinto area of Texas. The current sheriff has murdered
the young man's father in a gun fight where is he was supposed to be backing him up. The double dealings of the sheriff come to a head over a girl
and a gold mine. It a some old fashioned western with some pretty good costumes and acting and nice western background music.
You can expect guns blaising and a backward sort of love affair?",1227571200,,513,4.14

3658814,4,B001JNNDUG,Yup.  The good guys wore white hats and the bad guys wore black.  I found it fun because it reminded of the Saturday Movies my parents sent me to see...complete with a whole dollar to spend while they had sex.  Worth watching...not buying.,1425686400,,239,4.511627906976744

3658823,3,B001JNNDUG,"Love Mel Tillis and Roy Clark, but they need to stick to their roots (music) and leave the acting to the professionals.  Good story, but poor acting.",1407196800,,149,4.518518518518518
3658824,3,B001JNNDUG,This is not one of the best movies that we have watched.  It is hard to follow and doesn't make much sense until closer to the end.,1393632000,,131,3.8518518518518516
3658825,2,B001JNNDUG,"I had high hopes for this ""horse opera"" BUT I have a cut point in books, movies, and TV shows. I call it ""18 page cut"". If a book doesn't grab me within those it is cut, same with the others but those are timed at 15 minutes. Palo Pinto Gold didn't get close. When a movie looks flat from the first frame you can bet that it will not entertain your eyes later. I think I'd have enjoyed this movie as an audio book it sure wasn't a feast for my eyes.",1382400000,,449,3.838709677419355

3658828,5,B001JNNDUG,I lived in the area the movie is about. The movie lacks a little in the acting field but makes up for it in story line . I would highly recommend this movie.,1362355200,,157,3.787878787878788
3658829,5,B001JNNDUG,"Great, action-packed film, with some welcome humor to boot. Highly reminiscent of the Western movies so many of us grew up with.
