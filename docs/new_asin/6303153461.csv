575150,5,6303153461,"Just read the book for the first time so purchased the DVD to watch afterwards as I hadn't seen it for years.

(DON'T WORRY - NO SPOILERS!)

This miniseries was very true to the book and stayed close to the story.  Casting was great especially Rob Lowe as Nick (there's shirtless scenes - drool LOL) and Bill Fagerbakke as Tom Cullen (M-O-O-N spells great work, Bill!).  I did NOT like Laura San Giacomo as Nadine.  I think she's a horrible actress and her voice just grates on me!!!!  Corin Nemec is a bit too good looking to have been a convincing Harold Lauder.  You gotta dig his fake pimples and baggy clothes to make him look fatter at the beginning of this miniseries LOL!!!

I did find it odd that in the miniseries they completely omitted Rita who Larry meets in New York and then made some of the situations that occurred with her with Nadine instead and that ""Joe"" then instead shows up with Lucy - huh???

Also snickered that Max the dog was an Irish Setter in the book but then was a yellow Lab in the miniseries.  But then Labs ARE a lot easier to train, aren't they????

Read the book then get the movie - both are a must for Stephen King fans.",1511481600,4,1159,4.2949308755760365

575272,4,6303153461,"I like this film, but you can tell it was a multi-episode made-for-TV film. Like too many King novels that go to film, it lacks the intensity of the written word. Is a good story for those with faith in God, and perhaps good for those who need to find it. I will watch it again, I am sure. I have watched it several times over the years. Now that I own it, I can binge a whole day on it, which helps to not lose any of the story.",1508976000,2,429,3.7777777777777777

575275,2,6303153461,"I remembered liking this when it aired on TV many years ago. But after re-watching it, I'm not sure why. The story moved VERY slowly, the acting is often laughably bad (even by some of the big names stars in it), and it's just overall very cheesy. The book may be good, but this adaptation is very disappointing.",1508371200,,312,4.396551724137931
575276,1,6303153461,"This DVD set includes 2 discs and is divided into four parts.  But as someone else had reported in their review of this DVD set,  there is a huge gap between Part Two and Part Three.  It spoils the entire movie.  Near the end of Part Two, Stu Redmond had just met Fran and Harold.  Disk One ends, insert Disk 2 of 2 and suddenly when Part Three starts suddenly Stu, Fran, and Harold are in a warehouse with a several other characters that up to this point they haven't even met and Stu is performing an operation on one of the unknown characters on the floor by the light of a coleman lantern.  Continuity is completely wrecked as I went searching thru the scene selection menus of both DVDs trying to find the missing parts (nope, not there).  I have watched this on TV when it originally aired and seen it on VHS tape, so I know this isn't the way its supposed to go.  Gee, guess I'll have to hope that this is corrected when they someday release the Stand on Blu-ray.  This set blows, save your money (I wish I had).",1508284800,5,1019,4.211340206185567

575381,5,6303153461,"I watched this mini series when it first came on tv and a few times since then. I have also read the novel several times. It's about a virus that escapes a military lab and spreads through the world. 99% of the population is killed. People split into one of two groups: Mother Abigail (an old black woman) and The Walking Dude (he's the bad one). It has a lot of A list actors in it and I hated when the last part ended.

Disk Box = good, regular dvd box for dual DVD movie

Cover Art = good, but as I've never seen vhs/DVD cover art for this movie I don't have much to go on

Disk Front = there are no nicks/scratches or dings in the disk cover art and it looks really good

Disk Back = disk 1 upon initial inspection I found no problems. Nice dvd silver, but at 16min 33sec into the movie I encountered my first stall/freeze. I took it out and looked closer and found 4 or 5 scratches that may be causing the issue.

I have yet to put disk 2 in because of there are many more issues I'll be contacting Amazon but if not I can live with a couple of freeze/stalls.

It is probably one of Stephen kings most faithful adaptations. It's been years since I have watched one of his movies as compared to the novels they are usually a disappointment.

This one does his novel justice. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I like IT as well. Coincidentally both are mini series not a regular movie and are twice the length.

Don't give too much details of a movie but this one is a fight between good and evil after much of the world has passed due to a super flu. It takes place in North America.",1488672000,2,656,4.149606299212598

576213,2,6303153461,"The Stand was my favorite Stephen King novel. Loved the book and loved the movie even more when I read/saw each for the first time 20 years ago.  Recently, I had re-read Swan Song by Robert McGammon and I thought it would be fun to also re-read The Stand since both are about  good vs evil after an apocalyptic event in the US.  In the Stand, a biological weapon being designed by the US government slips out and kills around 90% of the population.  The few scattered survivors are drawn together by prophetic dreams; one featuring a ""dark"" man who can turn the electricity back on rapidly but is probably an agent of Satan.  The other is a 100 and some year old woman who sits on a decrepit porch in a cornfield playing a guitar and is known to be God's force for good.  The majority of the primary characters, of course, travel across the United States to Boulder Colorado to stand with this force of good and prepare to do battle with the the devil's minion.

I did not know that that this new Kindle edition was a new revision of the Stand with all of the parts originally deleted by the publisher inserted back in until I read the prologue.  What can I say?  Way to ruin your best novel, Mr. King.  It is so long and so dense that it makes the combination of Game Of Thrones, the Outlander and basically every Ken Follet book seem like a short pamphlet.  Although it does pick up in pace just a little after the survivors convene in Boulder, in no way is this going to be a quick read.  In fact, I am unable to finish after six weeks.  I would still promote the original Stand but this version is taking too long to get through and there are too many other books that would be more enjoyable.  Particularly drawn out are the conversations between the committee members in the Boulder Free Zone.  It might be better to just watch the movie.",1477785600,,1844,4.319767441860465

576710,1,6303153461,"i don't think the problem was the casting, although jamey sheridan as randall flagg was a huge mistep (and so was molly ringwald, who is adorable as a teen-coming-of-age but is by no means a skilled adult actress, sorry molly).  this minseries is poorly adapted, poorly produced, poorly directed, and poorly edited tripe that completely bastardized one of my favorite King novels of all time.  and it has his fingerprints all over it, sad to say.  Stephen... do yourself a favor.  give up creative control voluntarily.  do what you do best; write books.  you aren't doing yourself any favors here.

i believe the problem is that stephen king cannot seem to see film as anything but a B-movie venue.  Even when his books are awesome, the film adaptations typically fail (christine, cujo, tommyknockers, pet cemetary, to name a few) because they reduce his broad humanistic themes to a level of reductiveness that seems simply trite.  (king talks extensively of his love affair with B movies in Danse Macabre, a love i share, but doesn't translate well into his films).  IMO King should be barred from any involvement in film adaptations of his novels except maybe for final approval, and maybe not even that.  sorry Stephen!  i do love your work in print.  stop making bid-budget tributes to low-budget films.  Carrie worked well because someone understood and appreciated the raw adolescent pain captured in your earliest work.  The Shining worked because -- well not because it had much to do with your novel, i'll admit, but because it is just a great film.  Surely there is some middle ground here.",1462406400,2,1601,4.895910780669145

577059,2,6303153461,"I remember hearing about this TV miniseries when it first aired in the mid-'90s. Although I liked Stephen King's work, for some reason now forgotten, I didn't watch it at the time. I was prompted to watch it -- finally -- after recently reading the ""uncut"" edition of King's book. I enjoyed the book and I was curious to see how it had been adapted for the screen. Ordinarily, I wouldn't have expected much from what is essentially a 6-hour made-for-TV movie, but the host of four- and five-star reviews here prepared me for something above average -- maybe even great. Mine may be an unpopular opinion, but it's my own: I thought it was pretty bad. Maybe it was ""o.k."" for network TV viewers 20-odd years ago, but this is not a film that has held up well. From the Windham Hill-esque music to the soap-opera-grade acting to the stilted, cumbersome dialogue (much of it modified from the book to be ""network TV"" friendly), to the cringeworthy CGI, this *might* be amusing as fodder for MST3K, but on its own, it's a disappointment.

Stephen King's book is not without flaws, but it does manage to weave a rich, engaging story with believable, well-developed characters. At over 1400 pages in its ""uncut"" form, King's book makes us feel for the characters. His descriptive prose helps us to see every wrinkle in the pallid faces of superflu victims. We even come to know that sickly ""sweet"" smell of drying corpses. We know the thoughts that come to trouble the Walking Dude and motivate his actions. When Trashcan Man torches a Midwest city on his way to Vegas, we know *why.* Those kinds of details may seem superfluous (no pun intended!), but they make the story so much richer. That kind of detail just can't exist in a 6-hour small-screen adaptation. Too many characters are reduced to hollow shells of their book-selves (the kid Joe, for instance -- why did they even bother to keep him in the TV version?). In a story like this, the devil really is in the details -- quite literally -- and this TV version strips away too many of those details to make it a compelling show

I could list all the little irritations that keep me from liking this, but I'd be here all day. Some of the highlights: (1) Randall Flagg isn't nearly menacing enough. Also, with CGI this bad, why bother showing his human-head morphing into a demon-head at all? It would have been so much more effective to do what they did in the old days before CGI -- focus the camera shot elsewhere for a while and when it comes back to Flagg's face, we see that it has already transformed. (2) The acting -- oh the acting! Gary Sinise is actually quite good as Stu Redman, and Bill Fagerbakke makes a good Tom Cullen, but Molly Ringwald really phones it in as Fran Goldsmith. Flat. Flat. Flat. Lots of the peripheral characters (like the doctor in Arkansas who briefly befriends Nick Andros, and the workers in the Vermont health facility where Stu Redman is held) are terrible. While it's fun looking for Stephen King to make a cameo in any TV adaptation of one of his books, he gets a little *too* much screen time here and can't act to save his soul. All the poor acting becomes distracting. (3) The whole program definitely has a made-for-TV ""look"" about it with budget-level cinematography. The ""Mother Abigail at home"" sequences (dream or otherwise) could just as well have been shot by a local community access TV channel in their own studio with their own equipment. (4) The music. This is a real deal-breaker. The background music sounds like someone went to a Hallmark store and bought two or three ""new age"" CDs from a display by the cash register -- ""Acoustic 'blues' guitar for Quiet Times,"" perhaps -- and then just picked tracks at random anytime ""transition music"" was needed. Often, the music is totally at odds with the action on-screen, undermining what little emotional impact might otherwise be achieved by the ""not quite ready for prime time"" actors.

My suggestion: if you are new to ""The Stand,"" read the book and skip this TV movie -- entirely. Seriously. If King's book is a finely seasoned  entree at a high-end restaurant, this TV adaptation is the 99-cent ""Banquet"" version from the frozen aisle at a discount grocery store. I'm sorry I wasted a whole six hours watching ""The Stand."" If you *really* don't feel like reading the book but want to experience the story, I'd suggest waiting until the HBO version of ""The Stand"" that's currently in production comes out in another year or two. It can't possibly be any worse than this, and with HBO's resources and production values, it will likely be much, MUCH better.",1454976000,3,4612,4.64828431372549

577061,5,6303153461,"A classic. King has this weird way of inventing a story that seems a simultaneous combination of random improv and careful planning. The Stand is a long and rambling take of the end of the word as we know it, the death of 99% of mankind, and the struggles of the few survivors, and that's just in the first 100 pages. Most people think of King as a horror or suspense writer, but this book, like many of his others (Dark Tower), has more of an adventure/fantasy bent.
If you've put off reading this book because it's so long, or because you've seen the movie, you should just ignore those things and read it anyway.",1454112000,,615,4.356521739130435

577729,4,6303153461,"About as faithful as a six-hour (sans commercials) mini-series can be that's based on a work of more than six hundred pages.  Roles are well and sometimes expertly cast; I thought the best players were Gary Sinise as reliable East Texan Stu Redman; Rob Lowe in the thankless role of deaf-mute Nick Andros; Ruby Dee as ""Mother"" Abigail Freemantel, African-American prophet on a Nebraska farmstead to whom spiritual wanderers are drawn; and Ed Harris (unbilled) as the overburdened military officer ordered to keep the federal government's most heinous secret.  Molly Ringwald in the pivotal role of Frannie Goldsmith was uneven but steadied out over the course of the series.  Laura San Giacomo, actually a composite of two roles from Stephen King's 1978 novel, did very well as the emotionally labile and apostate Nadine Cross.  Jamie Sheridan, better known to modern audiences as Captain Deakins on LAW AND ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT,  here plays the youthful, ingratiating, and always slightly menacing figure of ultimate evil, Ol' Scratch himself (when not disguised as a curious crow).  Overall the series is a festival of small and smallish parts by movie and TV players of the era, such as Miguel Ferrer as one of the devil's administrative henchmen; Warren Frost (Susan Ross's father on SEINFELD) as Dr. George Richardson; and an unbilled Kathy Bates as a libertarian radio talk-show host.  Stephen King, who helped adapt his novel for this production, appears several times as one of the citizens of New Boulder.  Look very sharp for a grown-up Mike Lookinland, the youngest Brady Bunch son, as a military sentinel, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the streetwise voice of doom in a collapsing Manhattan beseiged by man-made plague.

While the acting and Stephen King's script construction is generally solid,  sets and special effects, typical of Nineties TV-movie standards, look uneven today.  Most impressive is probably the indoor set that represents Mother Abigail's simple farmhouse and farmstead; with the help of special lighting and photographic effects it serves a variety of moods from the purely realistic to the demonically surrealistic.  Although CBS and Paramount produced this film and its DVD release, and it was aired on ABC, some exteriors were obviously shot on the celebrated Universal Pictures lot.  This became most notable in some New York City street sets and the California mountains that subliminally mock ""central Indiana"" in Episode One as surely as they did the coastal plains of Alabama in 1963's beloved adapation of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD with Gregory Peck.  One acknowledges the distraction, then ignores it.

The DVD was a bargain when I purchased it, but be aware that there are absolutely no bells-and-whistles contained.  Is this movie entertaining, enlightening and somewhat spiritual?  Yes, it serves, and while it might be worthwhile today to commision a remake of THE STAND based on King's later (and longer) adaptation of his novel, and film it for HDTV, this one surely serves.

577730,5,6303153461,Of movies made off a Stephen King novel this one to me is the best. A horror film which our government through the military develops a biological weapon that by accident or purposely  is let loose on the general public and spreads out of control. For me it is totally believable because of my mistrust of government and those which are in control. The movie is loaded with a all star cast it is done well all the way through. If a down side it is the ending where the character which plays the head villan is a demon or the devil but hey it is off a Stephen King novel. Worth watching. I think you will enjoy it.

577951,5,6303153461,"I've read a great many reviews of the book, the movie and the mini series.  On my blog in an open letter to Stephen King, I said, Mr. King, you use a lot of words in your books, but fortunately each one of them seems to be the right one.  Mr. King is responsible for writing superb books.  I judge him utterly successful.  Directors are responsible for the outcome of VHS recordings of the book.  I judge most of those pretty good.  The directors of television mini-series are responsible for the outcome of their efforts.  I judge most of those absolutely reprehensible.  I agree with the reviewers who said if you want to experience The Stand with all the horror, the suspicion, the lies, the betrayals, the love and the hope, read the book.  Indeed. Read the book.  If you like movies, OK, it's a good movie.  It's better than most movies I've seen lately, and I've been somewhat tardy in reviewing most.  The bottom line here is, read the book.  If you want to see the movie, OK.  But please, don't bother with the mini-series.  It lost the wealth of Stephen King's wording, character development and richness of that vast compelling need to imagine, read the book.  Stephen King has rarely produced a bad book.  He should not act and he should not permit mini-series to be directed by bumbling idiots.  Did I say already?  Oh, yes.  Read the book.  Even watch the movie; it's not half bad.

All that is missing is a big screen re-make, hopefully with Stephen King advising (again!) and a cast as good as this one!  Especially in this day and age of Walking Dead.  Recommended!",1430870400,2,448,4.753246753246753
578081,4,6303153461,"Not a bad adaptation of a huge novel by Stephen King.

 Basic Plot: After a horrible virus accidentally becomes loose around the world from an Army chemical and bio warfare lab. The survivors of the plague ultimately form two different camps, one a camp of refugees who are noble and try to reform a new version of a  free democratic America whose members are also decent and spiritual people (the good guys); while the other camp draws people who live on the fringes of life where some are gangsters, street thugs, bikers, addicted gamblers, hustlers, drug users, or bullying type cops that find themselves drawn to Las Vegas where an evil sinister man becomes their Dictator in Chief (the bad guys).

 A nice old lady who is in the form of a sort of ""Christian Yoda"" type named Mother Abigal, with psychic powers channels different good guys from around the country to help her form a new nation.  At one point in the story the leaders of both groups come to the conclusion that two camps of extremes cannot survive, and one has to go down by some method.

 From a military & tactical viewpoint the villain, General Randall Flagg, is a remarkably bad leader.  He runs his show with a brutally sadistic iron fist, while allowing his society to deteriorate into ruin while he goes off into his bizarre and very weird excursions (in many ways he really isn't human, & as the series progresses you see he is more of a Demon).  He doesn't pay any attention to his logistical supply lines, the capabilities and numbers of his ""Marines, Soldiers, and cops"" that work under him, he has no grand scheme other then acting like a weirdo (his behavior is very ""Charles Manson"" like), he flashes into instant violent rages in one minute, then turns into a joking laughing barrel of hilarity the next (showing true bi-polarism).  The dude is just a whack job, and that is where the story (at least this tv movie portrayal) sort of brakes down.  Why would anyone with half a brain follow this guy? (Particularly if his ranks consist of gang bangers, money hustlers, & corrupt cops who on some level have to be fast thinkers, ruthless calculators, some times very violent actors in our world, & manipulators of people who are all self reliant.)  Their loyalty to him in my mind doesn't make one ounce of sense.  At one point he recruits the services of another fellow nut who has some knowledge of nuclear bombs, which the General logically needs to obtain (for the power & legitimacy of any regime).

  This is a very dark and ghoulish story, especially the fact that the Earth has been almost destroyed by this virus and there are piles of dead human remains everywhere that these survivors have to live among and witness all the time.  It sort of reminded me of the Holocaust just how awful the idea of being surrounded by departed innocent victims all around.  Not for the faint of heart like all of Stephen King's work.

  King even has a role as one of the characters in the good guy camp.  Gary Sinese is the main star, playing the role of a regular everyday Joe Shmoe ""Texas guy"" who for what ever reason is immune from the virus, as he helps led the camp of heroes finding ways for nice people to survive in a world of Hell.  B+ & thumbs up over all for one of King's longest and better science fiction horror novels turned into a tv series back in the 90's.

Mostly a television all-star cast, Gary Sinise, Miguel Ferrer, Rob Lowe, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Jamey Sheridan, Laura San Giacomo, Molly Ringwald, Corin Nemec, Adam Storke, Ray Walston and Matt Frewer and a cameo by King, himself. If you're unfamiliar with the story it's about a super-flu that wipes out most of the world population. In the aftermath, forces of good and evil attract the survivors into two different groups leading up a confrontation which is 'The Stand'. Director Mick Garris also did good job with 'The Shining' set at the Stanley Hotel, King's inspiration for the Overlook and the scary 'It' with another great ensemble cast and one the most nightmare inducing evil clowns of all time, 'Pennywise' played by Tim Curry.

It will be interesting to see what happens when the big screen version gets made. I can imagine some of the big scenes with a Hollywood budget and I think they will be awesome. This version though is incredibly good and is given the time for the story to fully develop. I'm glad I bought it so I can visit from it time to time.",1421193600,,1219,4.669767441860465

His books are very hard to adapt because your imagination might come up with something totally different than the filmmaker's.  The only issues I have with this are with some of the casting--primarily Molly Ringwald.  But in reading a lot of reviews it seems I'm not alone in this.  But for a TV series it's pretty good.

The first episode is pretty good, and offers an interesting end of the world scenario, torn right from Revelations. But the second is like being trapped in a terrible play, where each character repeats to the audience what's already happened and what they intend to do, over and over and over again. Molly Ringwald's character could be a torture device. Rob Lowe's was enough to make me think this movie in and of itself was the apocalypse, happening on my face.

This one is a standout.  King was a producer and plays a small role (as Teddy).  Kudos to the cast, with special mention of Jamie Sheridan as Randall Flagg (a.k.a. the Devil), Rob Lowe as Nick Andros, Matt Frewer as Trash Can Man, and the actor, whose name I don't remember, who plays Tom Cullen.

It is apparent that the screen writer and director have read the books. The book is great as all King fans know, and it's probably impossible to flush out everything in it without ten episode, but there is nothing cut or slightly adjusted which is a deal breaker. We have recently reread the book and then watched this dvd, and we were more than satisfied with this rendition. It was very fun. The casting was almost perfect in every way, and the essence of the story is intact. I think you'll be satisfied with watching this. We had a lot of fun.

King gives the situation two unexpected twists, however. First, the real story has nothing to do with the virus and everything to do with the eternal battle of Good versus Evil. If readers don't know their music from the 1960s and 1970s, they may not understand some of the first words we hear from Randall Flagg, the Walkin' Dude: ""Please allow me to introduce myself . . ."" But one doesn't have to go far to know that Flagg is BAD and Mother Abagail truly speaks words from God. The second great twist is that King deploys a very large cast of major characters without leaving any of them flat. Molly Ringwald and Gary Sinese render terrific performances, as do those who portray Nick, Larry, Tom Cullen, . . . and the list goes on.

The DVD did not show how painful a crucifixion is - most of the agony occurs when the nails are being driven in. Showing a dead body on a cross is not that impressive. For a better display of this, see ""Spartacus - War of the Damned"". Still, the DVD was entertaining, and it was good to see Molly Ringwald in something other than a high school movie.

580047,5,6303153461,"I have to admit I hate it when I go to read a review and instead find a long synopsis of the book.  Say the book is good, or bad, don't say how it ends,

Now, that off my chest-
I have a strange quirk.  I like to read the book of a good movie and watch the movie of a book.  For instance if you want to see the movie that even the stars Patricia Neal and Gary Cooper consider one of the worst they've ever starred in watch ""The Fountainhead"" by Ayn Rand.  Maybe if they'd barred her from the lot...but they didn't.

Another example is the latest version of Les Miserables.  Without it we wouldn't know Russel Crowe and Hugh Jackman couldn't carry a tune in a milk bucket.

But this review is about The Stand.
I 'sort of' watched it when it was on TV.  However when I watched the movie this time I did not realize how emotionally affected I would be.
I'm not a crying type person, but every time Ruby Dee came on the screen as Mother Abagail I did.  I thought that she was exceptional.
I am also not a big Gary Sinise fan; but I think that might be the CSI thing.  A bad show and a bad part.  But in this movie I couldn't imagine anyone else.  In fact I think that every part was perfectly cast except for Nadine.  Somehow she didn't carry the weight that the character in the book did.  Plus that God awful wig. Did they get that at a Halloween store?
There are two other actors that deserve raves also.  Some people have come down on Molly Ringwald in the part of Frannie.  I think that they are making the mistake I did with Gary.  They are stuck in the parts she played before, none of which called for the dramatic part she played here.  And of course Rob Lowe deserves accolades in his portrayal of Nick, although sometimes he read lips that he couldn't see.  And poor old Tom Cullen could easily have been made a caricature of his character, but he wasn't.  And the child, like Larry's New York girlfriend Rita, could have been left out since his character added nothing to the story.

The unabridged version of the book runs almost 1500 words.  I think bringing it so faithfully to the screen was a major undertaking that worked.  Of course having Stephen King write the screen play didn't hurt either.

If you want to see where this ain't working at all, try watching ""Atlas Shrugged"".  It should be Atlas sucked.

If you are interested in other books with an 'end of civilization as we know it' theme I'd like to suggest a few.
Of course the classic is ""Earth Abides"" by George R. Stewart.

""One Second After"" by William Forstchen should be required reading for everyone in this country.  It details the events in a small town after an EMP, or Electro Magnetic Pulse, renders all electronics in the country useless.  Think about it because this is a VERY real possibility with certain countries having atomic capabilities.  A warhead can be bought in the old Soviet Union for the price of a BMW and rockets are everywhere.  All it takes is one, let me repeat that ONE atom bomb exploded above the atmosphere and overnight we become a third world country.

And finally my favorite Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Nevin and Jerry Pouvnello.  An asteroid hits. Bye bye world as we know it.",1379721600,,3189,4.340101522842639

580050,5,6303153461,One of King's best. This is a long movie but it moves right along and keeps you glued to the storyline. Acting and plot are superb. The opening sequence with the music is creepy and believable. Classic Good vs Evil end of the world type story and we know who wins right??

I baught myself and my mom (who is a big Stephen King fan) a copy of this movie and we both are so happy to have it on dvd. Although I am a little sad that there is no bonus features. I remember one dvd edition came with a behind the scenes feature. I would love to see that.

580173,3,6303153461,"Okay let's face it. It's a movie. If you read the book, don't blame me if you are disappointed by the TV movie / miniseries adaptation. Having said that, the story and acting are oddly enjoyable considering the obvious compromises made for production. To be blunt, it's not all that thick on special effects, especially where it could use them. But that is fine.

Where I ding the snot out of this is the playback quality of the July 2013 re-issue of this set. I had the earlier set that honestly, well it got scratched up and unreadable, so I got the new set. The difference in playback quality is night and day! There is visible jerkiness and streaking whenever there is rapid motion on the screen. I have tried this with 2 DVD players, a BluRay player (PS3) and 3 PC DVD players... If I didn't love this movie so much I would return the disk. Tempted to try to get an exchange anyway. This shouldn't play back like this!",1374537600,4,923,4.39766081871345
580174,5,6303153461,"This dvd is based on the book that, to me, is King's best work.  The mini-series stars (with the exception of Molly Ringwald) really did their homework and played their characters  well. Some parts of the novel were taken out of the DVD script, but on the whole the mini-series left me very satisfied. it is now a summertime tradition every year to both watch the mini-series and read the unabridged version of the book. I'm sure that King kept tight control of the tele-play and I'm glad he did!

Often, the question would be, Which was better:  the book or the movie? In this case, the book always trumps, but not by so much that it makes the DVD unwatchable. .",1374364800,,663,4.409836065573771
580175,2,6303153461,"I just saw this miniseries again after years. I was so excited when this miniseries of my favorite of King's books came out, and I remember being blown away by the beginning, which was beautifully done.  But with 18 years between viewings, I can see how ridiculous and cheesy it really was. Let's see, where do I start?  Let's start with something shallow...the hair. Randall Flagg's hair was so ridiculous I wanted to laugh every time he was on.  He looked like some sad washed-up country gospel singer. He didn't do a bad job with the part, he chewed up the scenery pretty well and spit it out, but what can one do with a part like Flagg's? Nadine's hair was like a big fright wig, hanging everywhere and making her look like some crazy freak instead of the beautiful, sophisticated woman who steadily loses it as she gets closer to her ""wedding day."" The clothes....everyone's traveling to some portion of the west, but Julie Lawry is in these short full skirts and clumpy shoes that make her look like a Bratz doll. Frannie, a very capable woman, has a flowery, flowing dress of some type in nearly each scene even though she is riding a motorcyle across country, and what is that New Year's Eve clubbing outfit she wears to the first town meeting?  The women wear long scarves that would snap their heads off if they got caught in the cycles. Harold looks like some idiot about to enter his first leather bar.

And the casting....Molly Ringwald as Frannie? What a joke.  She can't act in a way that portrays the hope and anguish and all the other feelings that Fran is experiencing.  Most of the time her idea of emotion is to make the same face she does when Michael Anthony Hall comes out holding up her panties in ""Sixteen Candles.""  Shawnee Smith playing Julie was a complete freak show, even without her weird clothes and hair. Other than the four main men, (who eventually go and make The Stand) the acting is just atrocious all the way around.

Part of the best part of the book's ending is the long journey Tom and Stu make back to Boulder. But it is over in no time, and shows none of the hardships they experience. The movie could make multiple scenes showing the long trek as it steadily goes toward January...but no, they rush through and get there in November. That makes Fran's baby two months early. There is no way a 7-month premie would survive the superflu.  But the kid is six pounds something and not even in an isolette. Look up what a baby really looks like when it's two months early. And...for my last bit of nit-picking, if you look closely at the crib card in the last scene, she has a 30 inch chest and a 29 inch head.  Go ahead, get out a tape measure and take a gander at how big that is.  They could have left off a lot of the scenes, such as Trashcan Man staggering through the US saying Bumpty Bump, and devoted more time to the ending, which should have been even better than the beginning. But then the middle would still be pretty bad...",1374105600,2,2977,4.422303473491773

580287,4,6303153461,"The Stand is a mini-series version of the Stephen King novel of the same name.  In this case, the producers worked very hard to give the viewing audience the distilled, essentials of the book and its characters.

The cast of actor in the mini-series is first rate, especially Adam Storke's version of Larry Underwood.

The mini-series has too much of a made-for-TV feel, the special effects seem to be garage level-something like the first season of Star Trek the Next Generation.  The sets, though are pretty good.  Especially excellent is the portrayal of the Mid-West summer as the characters head towards Nebraska.

Stephen King's books and stories suffer from only one flaw- his Weltanschauung is that of a small town New England Yankee circa 1972.  His view of the Government, the military, and the like seem to be biological warfare, atom bombs, and cover-ups.  In his stories, there is always something a bit ""off"" about his descriptions of the people and places in the parts of the United States outside the North East.  Despite this, the use of The Strip in Las Vegas for the final stand between good and evil is well put, for the lights, bling, gambling, speculation and leisurely pursuits of Vegas have a sense of decay that that resonates outside Maine.",1365379200,,1266,4.851162790697674

Gary Sinise was perfect casting for Stu Redman.  The only thing that I was not pleased with was the casting of Randall Flagg.

580398,4,6303153461,"Summary of review's stance: While Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption are better movies than this miniseries version of Stephen King's opus, this six-hour epic of apocalypse and ""dark Christianity"" (in Stephen King's words) is an unexpectedly solid attempt at getting the weight of the book translated into a visual medium.

Quick summary of plot: a man-made plague wipes out 99% of the human population.  Those who survive in America are divided into two camps: those who follow the God-fearing Mother Abagail to Boulder, Colorado, and those who follow the monstrous Randall Flagg to Las Vegas.  Inevitably, conflict occurs.

Negatives:

1) It almost goes without saying, but many nuances of the book are lost in the necessary abridgment for the movie format.  The biggest of these, IMO, is demonifying the people who gravitate to Las Vegas (Randall Flagg, the actual demon, of course, doesn't fall into this criticism).  In the book, we can feel sympathy, even empathy for the baddies.  Yes, they do awful things and stand on the side of the scary monster (more out of fear and respect than adulation, seemingly), but they are human...they love children and when a mentally handicapped man joins their group, they treat him with affection and respect.  In the movie, this changes to them berating him for his ""retarded excuses"".  This oversimplification works fine in the movie, but loses some of the core humanity of the book.

2) Some performances are less than stellar: Molly Ringwald is not only horribly miscast as Frannie, but also turns in a terrible, melodramatic performance.  My wife does not think much of Laura San Giacomo as Nadine, though her striking looks, dark eyes, and ever-present decolletage make for a good visual of Nadine for me.  I find the woman who plays Mother Abagail mostly tolerable, but she has occasional awkward moments.  (This leaves the film without a strong female presence, sadly.)  Adam Storke who plays Larry: forgettable.  In a burst of genius, Rob Lowe is cast as a deaf-mute, such that he mostly has to shut up: sadly, the few moments he does talk (in dreams and the like) come out as bad as I might have expected.  I will say, though, that Mr. Lowe actually carries off some of his ""deaf-mute moments"" rather well, such as when he screams in fear and sorrow after killing a man in self-defense in the midst of a ghost town whose residents are newly dead to the plague.

3) Haha, some of the special effects are soooooo chintzy.  It was 1994 and not a Hollywood film, so don't expect glorious lightshows in this one.  Particularly the climactic moment of the whole affair has some hilariously bad effects.  In this same vein: some of the sets are a little obviously set-like (the cornfield never looked right to me, for instance).  One more thing: some shots are so obviously video and not film that it's painful (for instance the shot from the car's PoV exiting the gate at the beginning of the movie).

Positives:

1) The person with the hardest acting job in the whole movie is Jamey Sheridan who plays Randall Flagg: the dark man.  He pulls it off.  He's a grinning, maniacal force.  He's warm with the glee of destruction and hate.  He's scary but approachable when he wants to be.  When he turns into a literal monster, it's frightening and not silly (all right, most of the time...some of the effects, again, are a little cringe-worthy as I write this in 2012).  When he shows vulnerability, it's all the more powerful in its contrast to everything else he's been up to that point.  You need the antagonist to be a presence, and Mr. Sheridan delivers.  The long hair isn't really what I'd pictured, but he makes it work.  I cannot imagine that, if anyone ever tries to do this movie again, there would be a better Randall Flagg than the one in this movie.  Not everyone likes him, but I think he's just great.

2) One other person who deserves a specific mention is Bill Fagerbakke as the mentally handicapped Tom Cullen.  You are supposed to like this character, obviously.  But Fagerbakke does such a good job of playing it straight, of leaving Tom with the dignity he deserves, not an inept doofus, but a man deprived of just a few of the mental tools most people have.  He's warm and sincere and just a wonderful example of competence and reliability as handicapped characters go.  (My brother is autistic, so this topic is close to my heart.)

3) The following people are more than competent in their role: a) Gary Sinise as the stoic Stu Redman, b) Ray Walston as the blustery Glen Bateman, c) Corin Nemec as the immature Harold, d) Miguel Ferrer as the desperate Lloyd, e) Matt Frewer as the insane Trashcan Man, f) Peter Van Norden as the down-home Ralph.

3) I love the music in this movie.  It's sweeping, sad, tense, evokes America...it's everything it should be.

4) It is funny to say this about a six-hour film that needs to keep moving, but the movie does a good job of lingering, taking things slowly when it needs to for the sake of suspense or atmosphere.  We don't jump straight into the opening escape sequence at the military complex; we take a minute to set the atmosphere with music, a crow landing on a barbed wire fence, shots of children playing and a mother putting laundry on the line in back yards.  THEN the action begins.  Time is taken in all of the episodes after the first one to remind the viewer that this is a dead world (as far as man/woman and his/her trappings).  We see montages that show human objects uncared for, things rusting and breaking down, a world recently depopulated of people, corpses sprawled in odd places.  It keeps the viewer locked into the movie's universe.

5) The scary sequences (including the dreams) are usually pretty scary.  I really like Stu's event-filled exit from the Stovington disease center near the end of part one.

6) One grows legitimately attached to the characters, and their triumphs, defeats, conflicts, and (sometimes) deaths make an impact, at least on this viewer.

7) The commentary is usually pretty fun: I really like it when Jamey Sheridan and Miguel Ferrer talk together.  It's clear they had a lot of fun making this movie.

I'd have expected this movie to absolutely stink.  The fact that it's pretty good is astounding to me, given how much I enjoy Stephen King's work (most of his endings notwithstanding) and The Stand in particular.  If you're a fan of the book, I suggest at least giving the first episode (of four) a try, though that in itself is a 90-minute commitment, a movie of its own.  You might be put off by the 1994 effects and camera, but the story and characters are usually served well.",1346371200,,6653,4.701815038893691

Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.
----------------------------------------

When the word ""epic"" comes to mind I think of Stephen King.  King's works are amoung the greatest in the world.  Whether it's short stories or lengthy novels, the man can write, period.  Who out there hasn't been curled up in bed reading one of his works?

'The Stand' definitely is one of Mr. King's top 10.  FYI, please please read the book before watching the mini-series.  The book is AMAZING, and you do not want to cheat yourself out of this experience.

The mini-series is a direct adaptation from the book, and is one of the few adaptations that's is actually good.

**Mini-Series Details/Spoilers Ahead**

The 6 hour epic begins just as the book did, with an accidental outbreak of an engineered deadly flu virus, ""Captain Trip.""  The virus has a 99.4 percent kill rate.  So only .6 percent of the Earth's population will be immune and survive.  This first 2 hour segment is your classic viral outbreak movie, except that it hones in on the central characters and really makes you experience the loss they experience yourself.

Things start to escalate pretty quickly.  The government begins quarantining most cities and panic runs rampent.  Both the book and movie are pretty descriptive in this regard.  People are dropping dead left and right, and there is no cure.  Peaceful lives are shattered, mothers, fathers, children die, leaving behind only a few to mourn them.

In the end America is left in ruin.  Government is non-existant.  Streets are bare, everything is quiet, everywhere.

This is when the next segment of the series starts.  The few survivors must find their new places in the world.  This is when Randall Flagg, the personification of evil makes his appearance.  Flagg, a character in many of King's works, is like the devil put into flesh.  He is sinister, and smiles incessantly, reveling in his darkness.  Flagg is like a predator waiting for his time to shine.  With the world in shambles, he is ready to make his presence known and to carve out his kingdom.

But God will not have this.  Mother Abagail, an extremely old lady living by herself in Nebraska is chosen to become a prophet.  Somehow King makes this work in both the book and movie.  This show down between good and evil never gets too preachy or religious.  So even those who are not fans of religion will still enjoy this story.

Both the movie and book are too lengthy to discuss here on Amazon in detail.  I'll just say that you see all the characters go through quite a lot of changes.  2 towns are established, one town following Mother Abagail, the other town in Las Vegas following Flagg.  I think it's funny that the evil town is in Las Vegas.  There is obviously a 'Lord of The Flies' element here.  The town of Mother Abagail is democratic and meets at least once a week to discuss and vote on issues regarding the town.  In Las Vegas, Flagg is the law, what he says goes, or he kills you.

--Summing Up--

The one other element about this mini-series outside of the GREAT story that stands out is the CAST.  Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Rob Lowe, Jamie Sheridan, just to name a few off the top of my head.  The cast really throws themselves into their roles and the acting is TREMENDOUS.

This shows on Sci-Fi at least twice a year.  So next time it shows, give it a shot.  I myself watched it for the first time 3 years ago.  I had just finished reading the book, (more or less), and rented the mini-series from my local video store.  I watched half of it that night, and the other half the next day.  I ended up buying this set from the video store, when it was down sizing.  It sits proudly on my shelf now.  I would even consider re-buying this someday on Blu-Ray if it ever gets released.

Be advised this is a mammoth undertaking.  The book is huge, and the mini-series is long.  In all honestly I DID skip some parts of the book.  I WILL someday re-read the book.  Just know that if you commit to reading the book, it may take you 2 months to finish at a  casual pace.  The mini-series is apx 6 hours long, so that's a good chuck of time as well.  But in my opinion both are worth experiencing.

Know that availability of 'The Stand' on DVD is limited.  I know that my set is the complete set, nothing is trimmed off it's content.  It also has some bonus features as well.  I am not sure if other releases are condensed or not.  You should do research on this.  OR you could just DVR it next time it's on tv...

Anyway, that's my thoughts on this great mini-series.  Now if you'll excuse me I have to sneeze.  I hope I don't have Captain Trips...",1340236800,,4897,4.558755760368664

YUK !!

This was one of the longest, Silliest, poor excuses for a Horror movie.. Ever made.
There's not enough room to go over all the uglies this ""Yawner"" had, but here's a few.

The Premise to begin with (Human error releases a deadly flu virus)gets lost almost immediately. What happens in the next 6 hours is a poorly thought out unconnected jumble of a movie/series about the battle between Satan (?) and God (?) with a few unremarkable characters throw in.

Characters ? Well to be kind, there WERE some prominent actors. Sadly, actors who were thrown into the ""Pot"". Actors so poorly directed or who have lost the skill, that they were totally unbelieveable in their parts.
One role was Insultingly played as of a mentally challenged man. Shame on the producers/director who let that one get by. I hope every Handicap Helping Agency Jumped on them for that!
Ruby Dee? What can one say? Ugly makeup on a beautiful woman, long speaches that said nothing, bad lighting. Oh there's more, but....
Ossie Davis? What's a great actor with a handsome face doing in this Dog ? Not much !
Laura San Giacomo? Oh my! WHY ? Except for seeing a lot of her flesh, we never saw or heard much of the Actor in her..How sad is that?
Rob Lowe, thankfully, he played a deaf mute so he was spared some of the trite lines given to others in the cast.
Molly Ringwold appeard to be on some kind of tranquilizer for most of the show. Possibly with the Exception of when she would fall into her old role of a High School student. (Note to future directors: Never shoot Molly in profile! Nuff said ? )
I especially loved (wrong word) The rendering (Good word choice) of the FLAGG character played by Jamie Sheridan. Never has an actor been so Over the Top. So far over, in fact, that his proformance mostly...FELL off the edge.

TRITE ? Oh yes, the whole production was that. Poorly directed, Poorly acted, Poorly staged.
Nothing to say in praise about this awful production.. With the possible exception of....
Watch it for Laughs. There's a lot of them.
Otherwise, forget this one and pick up some of the other Brilliant movies Stephen King has been responsible for..

580453,5,6303153461,"This is one of my favorite novels and movies of all time.  This saga was so big that it could not be made into a movie but was produced into a miniseries in four parts.

* The Plague
* The Dreams
* The Betrayal
* The Stand

This DVD of the series follows the storyline of the book well and it is a good movie about the end of the world caused by a weaponized super flu that gets out of control of the US Army. The movie depicts the onset of the flu and how quickly such a plague can get out of hand and kill everybody.

The few survivors group together and Stu Redman (Gary Sinise) is one of the main characters who helps lead a group of them to Nebraska and then to Boulder Colorado to be with Mother Abigail Fremantle (Ruby Dee) who is gathering the righteous.  Trashcan Man (Matt Frewer) plays a key role in the story and does a wonderful job of playing the part of a simple minded arsonist who can't help himself but to always do the wrong thing.  He is a favorite of the movie's villain, Randall Flagg (Jamey Sheridan), who collects the worst of mankind and builds a community in Las Vegas.

This is one of Stephen King's best books and also one of the best movies ever made from one of his novels.  It is also one of the top horror books ever written and the first one I think of when I think of Stephen King.

I won't ruin the movie for you but I strongly recommend it to you.  I believe I have watched it 4 or 5 times and I still enjoy it.",1330128000,2,1447,4.010452961672474

The premise is good and it starts out well with the disease wiping out 99% of mankind. I can stand the low budget effects (it was 1994 after all) and cheesy dialog. But once the characters started coming together, it becomes confusing. There are many scenes that just don't fit anywhere. Almost none of the characters are developed at all. As example, between parts 2 and 3, you end with a convoy approaching one refugee group in Colorado, and the next scene in part 3, another refugee group is performing surgery! The scene is completely out of the blue, we have no idea who the victim is or how the main character obtained any skills to remove an appendix. In the next scene, two characters are making out and she's pregnant with his baby. They just met 10 minutes ago! It gives you the date at the bottom of the screen periodically - there is no way she would even know if she was pregnant yet. No one gave any thought to continuity in this piece. In another scene, they send spies to the evil city. A guy on a BICYCLE heads on the 800 mile trip, and in the next scene he is there working construction. The other spy who took a TRUCK gets killed halfway over an hour in the movie later. The third just suddenly appears there as the bad guy's mistress. So then the 4 characters decide to go to the evil city, on FOOT! But then when they get there, nothing mattered because a ghostly hand of GOD blows all the bad guys up. They could have just sat around BBQing for the entire movie. Worst ending ever. Then, the main character gets back to town and his baby has been born - and according to the date, 7 months premature apparently!

This whole movie is long, boring, pointless, and stupid. I won't be reading the book after this (especially since I hear the ending is the same in the book).",1327536000,3,1896,4.340845070422535

This miniseries focuses on a tiny part of the population that survives a superflu and then find themselves drawn to extremes of good or evil, represented by Mother Abigail and Randall Flagg, who first approach the cast of characters with dreams and visions.
The cast is impressive (even though some of these people were not as known back in the day): Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwold, Rob Low, Miguel Ferrer and Ray Walston. Stephen King has admitted that this story was influenced by the Revelations chapter in the Bible. The Emmies gave it a number of nominations, including Best Miniseries. Originally, parts of the miniseries were to be filmed on location in Boulder, Colorado.

580502,4,6303153461,"The Stand movie gets mixed reviews because most people recognize that, while it has flaws in several departments, it also has some truly excellent material.  In a way, you could say that mirrors the novel itself; with so much plot, so many characters, so much to keep track of, not everything is going to be perfect.  Overall though, it's completely worth seeing, and nowadays, when you can't just rent an out-of-print movie from the local video store, you pretty much have to buy it to see it.  If you're a fan of King (which I'd assume anyone looking into buying The Stand DVD would be), you should probably have it.  If not, you'll live fine without it.

As many point out, Gary Sinise's Stu Redman is worth the price of admission, and the performances given for Mother Abigail, Larry Underwood, Glen Bateman, and Tom Cullen stand out.  Miguel Ferrer also gives a strong performance as Lloyd Henreid despite the physical differences from the character in the book.  Obvious weaknesses are Molly Ringwald as Fran, Corin Nemic as Harold, and quite a few moments of poor acting.  On the so/so side, you generally get a mix of opinions on the portrayals of Randall Flagg, Trashcan Man, Nadine Cross, and Nick; all of which I find passable, but I'd love to see new versions.  And why the hell they thought Rob Lowe's face was too pretty to put an eyepatch over, I'll never figure out.

Story-wise, it's mostly faithful to the original, with a few characters and some dialogue either cut or re-assigned.  The edits are due to time constraints, which were still necessary in order to film the massive script.  This movie is not perfect, and you will definitely have small moments when you nearly hate the decisions the director or actors have made, but since it's mostly satisfying and enjoyable, I give it a B-.

Generally this is faithful to the book, but unfortunately some aspects of the story aren't explored as fully as they could be and other storylines are adapted or removed altogether. Considering how detailed the book is and how it would need to be altered for screen this is understandable. The reason I gave this three stars is that with the exception of Gary Sinise, and a few other minor characters, the acting is extremely wooden. The sets and overall style are a touch dated as well, but it tends not to detract from the story or your enjoyment too much.

580639,5,6303153461,"The Stand is quite possibly the craziest Stephen King film ever created.  I say ""crazy"" because the storyline takes a *bunch* of different twists and turns, and the amount of characters the storyline introduces is staggering as well.

You really need to give 100% attention in order to pay attention to a story like this.

I've actually waited over 10 years to get the opportunity to watch the Stand once again.  I watched it when it was first released, but I was young back in the mid 90's and couldn't understand (or remain interested in) a storyline of this magnitude.

Well, today I completely fried my brain and watched the ENTIRE movie in one sitting.  I'm exhausted!

The reason I became interested in the Stand in the first place is because of the way the story jumps around to several completely different locations across the United States.  You have the peaceful green lands of Maine, the dry colorless deserts of Utah, the ghost towns of Texas, the mean streets of New York, and several other areas.  Back in the mid 90's I was completely obsessed with geography and couldn't get enough of it.

I'm still amazed how the storyline takes us across several different areas of the United States, but now that I'm older I can actually understand the storyline as well.  Now I have the mature attention span to absorb all the events taking place.

The first part of the story deals with a devastating virus that spreads across the USA and infects millions of people.

Of course you've seen films like this before, so you know what happens when a virus outbreak occurs- the army and the government drive by in their trucks and army tanks, take everybody from their homes, and move them to a safe area.  The infected people are put in protected rooms in some laboratory or hospital.  Nothing new here.

However, Stephen King is a genius (as you probably know) and would NEVER settle for something so ordinary (that I've seen anyway- I don't read his books; just watch the movies).  So the storyline quickly morphs into something else entirely.

The focus on the virus outbreak quickly goes away as the storyline shifts to an evil presence being responsible for the outbreak, as well as mainly focusing on the nature of all the main characters in the film having unusual, frequent recurring dreams about an old woman who lives near a cornfield.

From here, the REAL storyline takes place, and the question will be ""Throughout all these elaborate turn of events, who will live and who will die?"" as well as ""Who will continue to remain good with good intentions, and who will jump to the dark side and betray their little gathering of people?""

The only problem with the film is that the third part (of the four) is easily the weakest, as the focus here is mainly on all the characters choosing to stick together and create this committee gathering of some sorts.  These segments last a bit too long for my liking.  They actually last about an hour too long.

Other than that, the rest of the storyline is golden.  I love this movie.

Of course some of the special effects are VERY dated by todays standards.  I could have sworn back in the mid 90's the Stand would go down as one of the greatest films of all-time because back then I never experienced anything like this before.

This was supposed to be Stephen King's grand statement that he was the true master mind at the weirdness factor.  However, some of the low budget effects have not aged as well as initially thought.  Oh well, small complaint.  Just ignore them.

Grab SEVERAL bags of popcorn, a few drinks, and sit back and watch this 7-hour long ride of storyline creativity.",1277424000,,3641,4.6421875

580856,5,6303153461,"There are forces at work in the universe that defy rational understanding or explanation. Thats why Steven King novels are so popular.

You probably already know the plot but here it goes: Superbad superflu is accidentally released (while BOC's ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" plays) and randomly kills all but a few hundred survivors who are immune to the superflu. The survivors come in two varieties: the good and pure souls played by likable folksy folk like a no-nonsense Gary Sinese, a deaf and dumb Rob Lowe, a flirty (but relatively innocent) daddy's girl Molly Ringwald, a wise old white guy Ray Walston, a wise old black guy Ossie Davis, and these pure souls all collectively dream of a front porch sittin' and guitar pluckin' witchy woman played by Ruby Dee who telepathically leads them to the promised land in Boulder, Colorado; and then there are the bad souls played by no-name actors who are led to Vegas by an old scratch who looks like a really bad and really coked-up eighties rock star (complete with tight jeans and mullet). The two tribes then go to war.

The good are those communitarians who care about other people; the bad are the selfish who only care about themselves. Simple as that. But the really interesting thing here is that King doesn't have nature or some supernatural force sort things out for the survivors; rather the survivors have to sort things out for themselves and some of the survivors are not certain which master they serve and which town they belong in (a very sexy Laura San Giacomo plays one of these undecideds). Ruby Dee might have special powers but these powers come and go and though they have the ability to gather people together and inspire them they cannot be relied upon to make every decision. The people must empower themselves. This is a very nice touch on Kings part.

King provides us with a great Andromeda Strain-style drama AND a clever piece of American social satire AND an interesting meditation on character,  religious prophecy/determinism, and free will all in one. If you don't like Steven King because he is not highbrow enough for you well its your loss because King is a crowd pleaser extraordinaire and these characters and this plot please at an exceptionally high level.

I love the examination of various geographies and psychologies and psychogeographies. King is a master at portraying regional types without resorting to stereotypes; I guess you could say that he invents his own pantheon of American archetypes for each project and this pantheon of archetypes is one of his all-time best.  Plus his diagnosis of American ills c. 1980's is right on. Eighties excess never looked so deserving of ...exactly what it gets. This film is six hours of extremely satisfying characterizations and plotting. And it provides the perfect antithesis to the ""greed is good"" eighties.

Only one flaw: The last hour is perhaps the weakest of the six but thats maybe because King isn't satisfied with the big comeuppance scene and tries to deliver a lesson about faith and sacrificing the one for the many that feels forced when everything else feels so natural and right. After five hours of excellent and inspired rock-fueled (I already mentioned BOC's ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" but Crowded House's ""Don't Dream Its Over"" is another song that is used to great effect) mini-series I think most people want a complication-free resolution. But thats a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent adaptation.

It had a great apocalyptic opening where it can possibly happen in real life with the virus and all. The second half jumps into this supernatural realm where people dare not go and I find that fascinating. I got this movie from a 5 movie collection by Artisan (also had Cujo, Golden Years, The Langoliers, and Thinner) and I received the 2-disc version which is good but its probably better than the flipper disc. I despise flipper discs because they get scratched and broken so easily that its not funny. Lucky me I guess. This would be a great DVD title to come out on Blu-Ray. Imagine the entire 6-hour film on one disc with no flipping or changing. The Golden Years was an amazing disc to me since the 232 minute film was on a single, non-flipper disc. Go figure. Yeah it takes off a lot of room on your shelf, since the VHS version of The Stand was 4 tapes. The DVD is either one or two discs. DAMN! Overall this movie is a must-see and I strongly recommend that you get a comfy chair and caffeine pills to get through this film. I didn't though. I sat through the whole 6 hours with no problem. I think you all can too. This movie is screaming for a Blu-Ray release. I'm not saying that I'm gonna get it (I'm happy with the 2-disc version just fine, since its 6 hours), but a Blu-ray release would be interesting.

The name of the horse was Pestilence.
The name of the rider was Death ... Revelation 6:8

Stephen King's epic novel was finally brought to the small screen in the mid-nineties. The long-awaited adaptation features an array of carefully crafted characters, survivors of a plague that wipes out most of the world's population. Essentially there are two groups who have survived the man-made virus known as the super flu: one who will follow Mother Abigail Freemantle [a messenger of God], and those who are tempted by Randall Flagg [suggested in the story as being the devil]. Each character experiences vivid dreams that feature either Mother Abigail or Flagg and is told to meet others of their kind in order to prepare for the ultimate fight between good and evil. The super-flu itself represents the end of mankind as told within the pages of the bible, Flagg being likened to one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Death, who rides a pale [sickly] horse and spreads plague and pestilence among those mortals who walk the earth. Those who are immune to the disease signal a chance for a new beginning.

As the streets become choked with bodies and the survivors light funeral pyres for the dead, it becomes evident that only one of the two groups can triumph. It is time for those who can still see good in mankind to take a stand.

The TV mini-series [6 hours in total] tracks the progress of each character in detail, although not in nearly as much depth as King achieves in his book. Like Dickens before him, King's characters are colorful and diverse:

Those who follow the aging Mother Abigail [Ruby Dee] to the Free Zone include a deaf mute [Rob Lowe], a retarded man-child [Bill Fagerbakke] a female student [Molly Ringwald], a quiet homely guy [Gary Sinise], a musician [Adam Storke], a retired judge [Ossie Davis] and a professor of sociology [Ray Walston] ... oh, and Kojak the dog, who outlived his master.

Those who follow the Darkman [Jamey Sheridan] to Las Vegas include a criminal [Miguel Ferrer], a schizophrenic pyromaniac [Matt Frewer], an unstable teenage girl [Shawnee Smith] and two troubled characters who are seduced by Flagg and defect [Laura San Giacomo; Corin Nemec].

The result being: educated, creative and good-natured characters Vs the dregs of humanity.

Mick Garris is the man to bring 'The Stand' from book to screen, having directed other King works such as 'The Shining' TV, 'Quicksilver Highway', 'Riding the Bullet', 'Desperation' and 'Sleepwalkers'.

'The Stand' also features Ed Harris and cameos by Stephen King, Mick Garris [director], Sam Raimi, John Landis [dir. American Werewolf in London] and Tom Holland [dir. Thinner & The Langoliers].

Considering that this movie was made for TV it could not have been done better...I plan on read the book soon, sense I loved the movie so much...this in my opinion is the greatest story the King ever wrote, considering that there are so many others just as good.

580936,4,6303153461,"My lady and I both agreed that this may have been more accepted as a major motion picture, but you could not cram this story into that type of time frame.  Instead, Mick Garris took the bull by the horns and along with King, set out and made a TV mini series of sorts with it.  The film does follow the book fairly well although I did notice some inaccuracies but nobody is perfect.  The story is about a super flue virus that is accidentally unleashed after a failed quarantine at a military testing facility.  One man who is a guard on duty flees with his wife and baby, only to end up finding out that he had been infected before he left.  In 3 months 99% of the population of the Earth is dead, and what is left are two camps of survivors, one good and one not so good.  The bad guys are assembled by a spawn of hell, some sort of supernatural demonic power that takes on a human form as a long haired guy in a jacket and cowboy boots.  The man is called Randall Flag and he is played by Jamie Sheridan.  The good people have dreams of an elderly woman in Nebraska who summons them to follow her to Boulder, Colorado where they will all meet and eventually take on Flagg and his followers.  I am dismayed at the reviews that say the casting is bad, this cast is just great!  Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald and Rob Lowe just to name a few, and they are all fit for the role that they play in The Stand.  The scenes of an empty New York city are very sombering and the ideals of good vs. evil are shown exactly as they should be.  I think I liked Rob Lowe as Nick Andros the best, Lowe plays Nick who is a deaf mute and he is amazing in this movie.  If people liked the book it is a must see, and even if people did not read the book they still might like it anyways.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the sound quality is not great, not bad just could have been better.

No, really.  This movie overall was pretty well done.  I, of course, would have chosen some different actors and actresses to play some of the characters, especially Frannie and Nadine, but the remainder of the cast sufficed.  The acting was great.  The human interaction was very realistic and enjoyable.

I gave this movie a ""medium-ish"" rating because it really *tried.*  And trying is very important.  It's just that I read the book first and *everyone* knows better to expect a movie to equal the book it's based upon, right?! :-)",1181520000,5,784,4.6231884057971016

Parts 1-2 side A and 3-4 on side B.

However something is missing here when you flip the disc!........

Side B (Pt 3 Betrayl) opens up with Stu crudely operating on someones body on the floor. (Who is this that dies?)

Ossie Davis(the judge)is also there(When and where did he appear before-storyline?)

Gary S.and Molly R.are already lovers and shes pregnant (When and where did they hookup?)Last thing I saw in Pt 2(Dreams)was Stu telling a jealous Harold he wouldnt cut in on his action.......

There is alot more but my question is are these scenes on the 2 disc set or just not explained? I believe the running time 366 min is the same.

Overall I found it to be one of the best TV mini-series ever.

Those that disliked the Christian elements should take heed. This was truly about the everyday struggles we all go through. The constant battle of good/evil,love/hatred,positive/negative,caring/uncaring,beauty/ugleness,day/night,death/birth and yes God and Satan! It was a story of struggles and having faith that good will over come evil! Even Satans/Flaggs men knew it was wrong but where tempted with lies and promises. Trashman even asked for forgiveness in the end and brought the bomb to end it all. The hand of God was very symbolic,though a bit chessy effect.

If you got anything out of this beautiful epic remember this:

""THE GREATEST LIE THAT SATAN HAS GOTTEN US TO BELIEVE...IS THAT HE DOES NOT EXIST""...Scary stuff indeed: Where will you be a second after you die?

  Following a deadly plague  that kills most people, the survivors of the plague have a dream about a black woman named Abagail Freemantle (""Most people 'round here just call me Mother Abagail"")  calling people to her.  The survivors also have dreams about ""The Walkin Dude"", a.k.a. Randall Flagg.

580940,5,6303153461,"I absolutley love this television miniseries. This is easily the best of all the television adaptations made out of King's work.  As a horror film fan as well I also believe this to be the best horror 'film' of the early '90's. The early '90's saw a severe dry spell in terms of horror cinema, particularly in north America, but Mick Garris was able to construct a story that both terrified and moved audiences. The opening of the miniseries is without a doubt one of the most terrifying openings to a film ever.

One would think that Garris would have been severly restrained by having to make such a terrifying novel into a made for TV project. Garris is able to scare without relying on gore, although he does not back away from showing  many scary images that deserve alot of respect for balancing image with the power of King's original story.

The film differs from the novel, obviously it must due to the fact the miniseries was to air on television and be reduced to six hours from a novel that was over 1200 pgs. 'The Stand' is easily my favourite King novel ever; I think King tapped into a deep dark need for anyone who lived the last half of the 20th century preparing for the end of the world to see how the end would of the world would might occur.

Recently I re-read The Stand and enjoyed it more than the first time round. Following this I thought I'd give the mini series another shot. That was a bad mistake - although I enjoyed the book even more the second time round I hated the TV show even more.

Apart from having the storyline canabalised, the most annoying thing about this is the appalling casting. The only two well cast roles are those of Gary Sinise as Stu Redman and perhaps Adam Storke as Larry Underwood. Molly Ringwald played a very unlikeable sour faced Frannie and Jamey Sheridan was anything but frightening as Randall Flagg. Perhaps the worst of all was Bill Fagerbakke as Tom Cullen. All I could see from his role was an ordinary - average actor trying to act retarded and failing miserably. Indeed, Laura San Giacomo gave a very convincing performance as a retarded Nadine Cross - the only problem being is that she is not supposed to be retarded.

One thing I was very surprised to notice when I watched this TV show again is that it was made as recently as 1994. It looks and sounds much older than that - perhaps a mid 80s' production.

Other reviewers have described this as very B grade. I'd have to agree.

Being able to view this movie on DVD with the extras is an experience that is so far above the video version. For a film that was made in the eighties it truly does stand up to the test of time. It is an epic that has until recently had no peers in scale and story telling. The story itself stays as true as is possible to the book on which it is based (in no small part to the fact the writer has a quite large speaking role.) It is and will always be one of my favorite movies.,1140998400,2,559,3.869565217391304
581096,4,6303153461,"This six hour version of the hit miniseries is one of the better adaptations of Stephen King's works.  THE STAND is a long, involved epic about the battle between good and evil; God and the devil, and boasts some fine performances from its large cast.  I watched it in two sittings, as six hours a little too long to sit in front of a tv?  Anyway, director Mick Garris is to be credited for keeping the movie interesting most of the time, and his lapses come mostly in redundant scenes and slow pacing at times.  We all know the story, if not by reading the book, than by either viewing the film or reading other reviews.  What I would focus on at this time is some of the wonderful performances in the film; while most of the cast does fine, there are a few standouts:  Rob Lowe in a virtually non speaking role seems right at home as Nick Andros, conveying genuine emotion and sincerity; the marvelous Ruby Dee took a rather annoying character and fleshed her out enough to enable us to tolerate her incessant preachiness; Bill Fagerbaake (sp) takes the stereotypical role of the retarded oaf and imbues it with such sincerity and naivete, he steals most of his scenes; Miguel Ferrer as henchman Floyd Henreid gives a good performance as a man whose own conscience gives him battle, and Ed Harris in a cameo role as the general in the first segment brings a sense of impending doom.  Other cameos include Kathy Bates, John Landis, and Kareem Abdul Jabaar.  Although Molly Ringwald doesn't ruin the film, she seems miscast with the older, more laconic Gary Sinese; and Corin Nemec doesn't bring the right kind of lunacy to his role as Harold Lauder.  Matt Frewer as Trashcan man and Laura San Giacomo's Nadine Cross seemed to be overacting, and it takes a while for Adam Storke's Larry Underwood to become convincing.

581097,2,6303153461,"Ah, yet another disastrous made-for-TV adaptation of an incredible Stephen King novel. How many will it take before someone notices it's just not working? King mini-series alumni Mick Garris is back and, big surprise, worse than ever. You would think at least one person would have denied allowing him to destroy another King novel, but no, we are forced to see yet another dumpster-fire of a movie. So much talent (from the novel, of course) wasted on Garris' unimaginative, uninspired, unthinking style, and I use the term ""style"" VERY loosely. The direction looks like what you would get if you gave a degenerate ten year-old a handheld camcorder and let him go to work.

Then, there's the acting...if you really consider it that much. Even rather good actors and actresses lacked substance, some of which can be chalked up to infantile Garris direction, but only some. Casting was a joke; nearly none of the actors truly fit the roles they were playing, and quite a few were completely absurd. Corin Nemec has to be the worst possible choice to play Harold Lauder, who in the novel was an overweight young man with acne, not a skinny goofball with less acting talent than Mariah Carey. Even Gary Sinese wasn't all that convincing, though he could have been with better direction. I shouldn't have to mention Jamey Sheridan was FAR from a convincing Flagg. King's teleplay was okay, considering there was some serious cheese due to the fact it's a tv mini-series. This novel was never meant to be so censored, so the dialog, action, ect. are often rather corny and irritating. So many allegorical elements were cut so this could be shown on network television it really hurts the overall story greatly. There is much more I could go on about but it all boils down to one simple fact: A 1,100 page novel with subject matter such as The Stand has will NEVER be able to be accurately and worthily adapted to film if said film is a made-for-tv movie-of-the-week.",1136073600,5,1961,4.767647058823529
581098,4,6303153461,"For a made for TV miniseries 'The Stand' ranks among the higher quality. We all know the plot I'm sure:a government created supervirus called 'Captain Tibbs' kills off 99 % of the human race except a scattered few hundred immune survivors. Some dream of and seek out a heavenly elder named Mother Abigal (marvelously played by the late great Ruby Dee) or the devilish Randall Flagg. It's an exellent plot with some great cast members but....

1:) WHAT IS GARY SINISE DOING IN A TV MOVIE?I would think he'd be a little beyond it as a proffessional Hollywood actor. But despite having just gotton off of 'Apollo 13' his performance does it for me of all the actors.

2:)The first segment 'The Pleague'doesn't flow well onto the next segment 'The Dreams'.The plot seems a bit hurried. A virus is unleashed in rural Texas,it's contained but somehow it leaks out all over the counrty and all of a suddenly people in LA,New York and Maine are getting it. All of a sudden in 'The Dream' everyone has completely parished. It's as if the first segment was Step 1 and the second was Step 3. My guess:the burning of the flu victims bodies caused the virus to become airborn?Whatever.

3:) On the same (and a better note) the hysteria created by the superflu is scarry and riveting. Those who don't succomb to the flu are killed in massive street riots by or military troops who declare martial law. It's a scarrily realistic apocolyptic nightmare in the finest X-Files tradition. The whole first part generally deals with hysteria and is the scarriest part of the whole series. Problem is.....

4:)The rest of the series isn't that scarry at all. The villian Randall Flagg sadly comes off a a slightly cheesy B-Movie type monster who's followers seem scarrier then himself. Now Ruby Dee's Abigal?Whole different situation. I was convinced until she actually appeared that she might in fact have been a angel. I think she was. Like Gary Sinise Ruby Dee seems a little beyond this. But as always she is highly convincing,even though....

5:)The way in which the good/evil plot was presented might be a bit annoying (even slightly offensive) to non Christians. When Rob Lowes character Nick questions Mother Abigals constant chatter about god he is laughed at basically. This could all be Stephen Kings horror version of 'Touched By An Angel'?

6:)The music in the movie makes sense until Corin Nemic starts blasting 'Boogie Fever' while he's building a shoe box bomb.""NO one gets between me and my disco"".Cheesy as velveeta but hilereous nontheless.

7:)I like the character of Ralph. He had a big heart and all he did was end up being a human sacrifice in order to kill Randall Flagg and his followers. In my opinion you need alot of willfull,big hearted people to rebuild a world,not that....

8:)Gary Sinise's Stu Redman wasn't lacking in heart but as the series goes on you notice how he is so tempted to make the mistakes that got humanity killed off. The implication seems to be that guns and violence solve every problem-is there REALLY a good and evil side. In the end Mother Abigals 'enchanted hand of god' enables an A-Bomb that destroys Flagg's heabquarters in Vegas. So are we talking about good guys or bad guys?

9:)The character Nadine got on my nerves. She was a weak,spineless disgrace to femininity and why she deserved not to die with everyone else of the flu is beyond me.

10:)I guess the good part is that 'The Stand' shows if humanity really pulls together in a crisis they can get things accomplished. The trouble comes at the way these accomplishments are carried out. NAW!Some of the 'good' survivors are clearly Jewish and athiast and I'm sure don't really get into Abigals highly Christian ideals.

  Okay so except for Nadine who should've died before the end of part one that's all subjective nit picking:just my opinion. That and of course the ending. The ending is so cutesy and oozy it's almost gag inducing. I'm not saying someone else should've died but it ended on the clished 'Adam & Eve' IE Gary Sinise/Molly Ringwald note. I would've like to see the end revolved around a newer (and more humanitarian) governing system coming into place. Better drama. It's obvious after watching the first part that it was US militarism and blind hysteria that was largely humanity's demise. And it does present an important social message to everyone-in times of a crisis,even the all too realistic epedemic presented here and people should think a bit before blindly following a leader because if we keep bumbling blindly forward and forget who we really are we could all be facing a very real 'Stand'.",1133222400,3,4614,4.788679245283019

581100,2,6303153461,"To the chagrin of a billion readers, director Mick Garris & Co. (which included the tome's author, Stephen King) offers us a vapid TV visualization of ""The Stand"", diminishing all impact which imagination initially lent this powerful epic; driving onto the wastelands of a dead earth, seeing an unseeable being (Flagg) in our mind's eye, envisioning the disturbing horrors of the Lincoln Tunnel gridlock, the appendix operation, the suicides and rapes and mean killings.

In TV Land, we're stuck with an intelligent A-Lister working his laconic Mini-Eastwood Method (Gary Sinise), aided by a clutch of talent-challenged second-stringers, aspirin-ad veterans and phone-in cameos. And the Bad Guy - the incarnation of hell-on-earth whose visage people could not cast their gaze upon: a country singer with a mullet!

If Jeff Goldblum (as rumored) had accepted the role of Flagg, we might have had a respectable screen-demon on our hands - instead, we meet the Dark Man of all our nightmares as a toe-tappin' redneck with a Def-Leppard-roadie hairdo. The only thing more sinful than his Huey Lewis mullet-palooza was his 80's fashion sense.

A super-flu has wiped out the bulk of humanity and two camps (one Good, one Eeevil) amass devotees to stage a Final Battle. The Good camp leans heavily on the delusional proselytizing of their matriarch, Mother Abigail, no one noticing that the ""epic"" quest that she entreats four characters to undertake ""to make a stand"" achieves nothing that wasn't going to transpire anyway. The Eeevil Flagg's downfall was precipitated by inefficient management and insubordination, not the half-assed jibes of Our Heroes, who very rightfully got crucified for their troubles... Trusting to the wigged-out soothsaying of a raving old woman hallucinating from her mixture of Demerol, Cyclizine and down-home moonshine and traveling to The Dark Man's lair with no plan, no resources, nothing but ""the shirts on their backs"" was bound to lead to the business end of a crucifix.

Even in the book, simply laughing in the face of the Bad Guy in order to cause empire-crumbling dissension was an obtuse disconnect; a tale so wonderfully kinetic and operatic - brick-walled when one realizes that the author himself had no clear notion on how to wrap that beargarden with any serious impact.

The book is more forgiving in its inconsistencies and characterizations, but that is more telling on the genius of the writer than the content of the tale itself.",1128297600,7,2475,5.162094763092269
581101,3,6303153461,"Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and THE STAND is one of my two or three favorites of his.  So I had a mixture of excitement and dread when the mini-series first aired years ago.  But I watched, and was overall pleased.  This week, I watched it again, so my kids could see it, and my reaction was mixed again...although as is so often the case with TV products, they don't age very well.

One small example.  The character of Randall Flagg (by the way, if you don't know the story, don't look for a summary here...I'd hate to try), who is supposed to be this really dangerous, crazy, powerful, charismatic, ""devilish"" creature, comes across mostly as a bit peevish.  His clothes, including denim jacket and overtight jeans, don't help the image, but it's his hair that is so funny.  Long, flowing dark locks than sometimes dangerously hint of a mullet.  This does not instill fear in the modern viewer.

THE STAND is very well produced for a television ""event.""  These things are on tight budgets and have to be filmed in half the time or less of a comparable movie.  Special effects money is very hard to come by.  And it shows in spots.  The climactic scene in Las Vegas loses some of its potential power by virtue of some hokey effects.

But despite the fact that this story has lots of ""plot,"" it is really a character driven piece...because it's so important that we care about the people in order for the book's events to matter to us at all.  In this the book was fantastically successful.  Each major (and many minor) character left an indelible impression.  The mini-series is less successful.

First, the successes.  Gary Sinese plays Stu, the main ""good guy,"" and although in reading the book I would not have pictures Sinese AT ALL, he's a good actor who brings an everyman intelligence to all his roles, and it works very well here.  He's the anchor for the show.

Rob Lowe plays deaf/mute Nic Andros, and sometimes he's just a kind of ""dewy-eyed"" saint, looking all loving and understanding.  But after awhile, we believe that he really is this noble, and Lowe plays the part with conviction.  This was his first real shot at redemption after all the scandals had surrounded him, and it helped set him back on this way to stuff like WEST WING.

Adam Storke plays the other ""main"" good guy, Larry Underwood.  In the early scenes, when he's mostly an obnoxious rock star, it's hard to buy.  I'm not sure where his accent is coming from, and he doesn't really seem convincing as a star.  But he grows into his character, and suddenly by the midpoint of the series, we see he's really grown into the part and we are able to empathize with him.

Bill Fagerbaack (I'm going on memory of the name here...sorry) plays the mentally challenged Tom Cullen.  It's a tough role, because it teeters on caricature, but the actor makes it his own and we really like the character.  Miguel Ferrer as Lloyd is outstanding as always.  Here's an actor that is STILL due his full accolades.  He's good in pretty much everything he does.  He makes Lloyd a great character.  Ruby Dee as Mother Abigail is just right, and her husband Ozzie Davis in a small role is also always a commanding presence.  Matt Frewer is delightfully over-the-top in the smallish but pivotal role of Trashcan Man.  The actresses who play both Lucy and Dana (I'm sorry I can't name them) are both terrific, and modulated.  They are able to act in a story that's a bit outrageous, and make the parts still seem rooted in reality.

The other two major actresses in the show don't achieve this balance, however.  Poor Laura San Giacomo is pretty bad as Natalie, Randall Flagg's intended bride.  Her character is supposed to be a bit crazy, but San Giacomo is right off the map.  Shrill and nasal at the same time.  Not in the least bit believable at any moment of the show.  But she's ""matched"" by Molly Ringwald, who no doubt hoped this role would help her transition into ""adult"" parts.  The results are a mess.  She still comes across as a child, and not a very mature one at that.  Her efforts at emotion are paper-thin and unconvincing.  While some argue that it's an underwritten part, it is also a somewhat ""real"" person too.  No special powers, just a solid individual trying to make the best of things, be strong, and bring a baby into a crazy world.  Instead, Ringwald's Fran is just a mess.  Others who fail in their roles include the young man playing Harold...he is certainly annoying, but mostly because he's so bad.  And Jamey Sheridan as Randall Flagg was a big goof.  Couldn't they have found someone with gravitas.  I've seen him in roles recently, as things like Police Chiefs or Politician, and he's better now.  But in THE STAND, he just doesn't pull off threatening.  Part of it is the hair, part might be the dialogue, but a big chunk of the blame rests on the actor.

Overall, this is a show worth seeing.  It's still a good story.  It keeps your interest.  But you can't help turning if off at the final credits and wondering what it might have been with a more solid cast.

I recommend it, but not by much.  In about 10 years, when technology is much advanced, I'd like to see it remade.  Get a better cast and use CGI to make some real crowd scenes and scenes of devastation.  Anyway, until that happens, go ahead and check this one out.",1121299200,11,5339,4.52565445026178

581151,5,6303153461,"I have spent time reading other reviews from the utterly ridiculous ( is like it was made by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  comes to mind.. say something useful next time) to the average: telling who you do and don't like, to some outstanding thoughts on the making of this miniseries.

I didn't read The Stand before I saw the miniseries. In fact for the most part I had given upon Steven King many years before. I know he has a cult following that would be envied by any writer, but after reading ""Christine"", ""Pet Semetary"" and ""It"" I just wasn't A King Fan. I read those because I had read ""Carrie"" and seen the movie and enjoyed the thought provoking ideas in them. I felt some disappointment in the others. However I will not say it was because he was a bad writer, but more that he wasn't my ""cup of tea"" so to speak. A co-worker had recommended ""The Stand"" to me as he said he thought it might be something I might enjoy, with my statements of trying to undeerstand true good ane evil and such. I didn't have alot of respect for this co-worker so I sort of just let it go.

I don't know why I watched the miniseries. I am glad I did. What I had been missing in these other King stories I found in ""the Stand"". The real joy of finding this novel is that it lead the way to my enjoying a few other of his really fine works, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"". These to my mind make up stories that you think about long after you see the film images. I have copies of these books, so I glad for a break to find there were indeed stories to my taste.

As to the Miniseries and the mixing of parts, and scene, people. It's my understanding this wasn't huge budget film. They were filming in American Fork, Utah. Not exactly the land of the big spenders :-)  just good down home people. So part of what we see, the fact that its in the segments its in and more fleshing out and better graphics is part of the issue. For what I understand they had to work with, I think they did incredibly well. I agree in the general idea that Gary Sinese, Rob Low, The actor's portraying Tom Cullen were incredible. They are the people I picture in the book. Molly Ringwald was not the frannie in the book, but I am wondering now if it had to do  more with trying to fit things on the screen and no have someone steal the thunder from the other parts. I don't have the immature need I have seen on this thread of reviews to hate Ms Ringwald. I leave that to others to work out in their little minds. She isn't the Frannie in the book, but I wonder if she is the Frannie Mr King decided to work with to play UNDER not over some of the other amazing characters.

Again the other two I question as not being who they were in the book are again probably what you get when you condense parts and try to make it work on the screen. I love Laura San Giancomo  but she is NOT Nadine. I think someone said something about an Andi McDowel and I have to agree with that. However again they mixed two characters and perhaps the class, and cool and goodness of Nadine had to be nixed to try and fit it all in. Having said that, I will admit she WAS Nadine for the most important scene she had. And that was before she was thrown to her death in Las Vegas. She was essentially the Nadine of the book there. The other of course again was Harold. Harold. Where on earth were you going to find a pimply, fat, actor that people would have a love/hate relationship with?? A Pity/dread fear of? So. Harold got a little ""watered"" down so to speak , but the actor who played him was fine. He did just fine. It just was hard to bring out the feelings that Harold gives you.

Beyond that.. I continue to understand, and mostly because Mr King is still conflicted with the idea: what Makes a Righteous man and what makes a wicked one? The answer is so simple, but one that people still don't want to hear. The righteous man is the one repenting.

However ""The Stand"" is a great story and a great read. And the story is highly watchable. Enjoy!",1110672000,8,4054,4.172634271099744

(Personally, I thought Molly Ringwald played Frannie to PERFECTION -- Frannie never *was* the most likeable character.  My complaint, on the other hand, is with Adam Storke's moronic Larry.  And did anybody else feel he was *really* playing Eddie Dean from The Dark Tower?)

Anyway . . . The point I wanted to make is that the movie has a beautiful LOOK to it.  Whether it's a post-plague NY in flames, or the tranquil boonies of Utah, or somewhere in-between, marvelous photography abounds.  This is by no means the most important part of filmmaking, but it sure adds a lot to the viewer's enjoyment!

Other than that, the first 20 reviews or so have it right (Except, of course, that I give Ringwald a thumbs-up, despite her limitations.  I remind you, Frannie Goldsmith was LIKE that in the novel.)",1107993600,5,955,4.733333333333333

Though I personally think 6 hours is way too short a time to fit the Stand in...

The important bit here is the packaging, which in one word is ""lousy"". Very cheap stuff. I saw far-east pirated DVDs in better packaging than this, for Bob's sake! Really: if I had seen this package in a store in my part of the world, I would have assumed it was pirated and passed it over without a second look.

I just received this DVD, as I write this review, and the plastic is already cracked and broken, in places. It was not the shipping, since other items in the same shipment were not damaged at all and the cracks follow clear lines that can be seen in the still-unbroken plastic. I will try to post some pictures later.

Anyway, there is nothing wrong with the DVDs themselves, thankfully. Apart from the hated (to me) Full Frame format and the expected grain in the video, considering how old this title is. Perhaps some more de-noising could have been done when mastering this, but the final result is still very acceptable. Just keep in mind that one of the first things you will have to do after buying this title is get a new home for the DVDs since the one that comes with them simply is not usable.",1106784000,4,1370,4.33984375

It had taken me over a year to read, but during that whole year, I found it very hard to put down. Little did I know that the movie was this amazing. I just received the movie for Christmas on DVD. I watched the movie in one whole night and I did not get to bed until four in the morning. Let me tell you all that it was worth staying up that late to watch this six-hour masterpiece that was adapted from one of Stephen King's best tales of horror.

Not only do they dream about the sweet old woman, they dream about The Dark Man, whose real name is Randall Flagg. Randall is all evil in its purest form, for he is the Devil himself. Will everyone one die at Flagg's evil wrath? Or will they take THE STAND and send him howling back to the gates of Hell?

581156,5,6303153461,"The Stand, for anyone who hasn't seen it is a very long movie, but draws you in fast. Unlike most long movies, even slow parts explained alot and had a way to draw you in. I never seen this when it was on tv, but when I bought the dvd 'its 2 dvd's', I expected to watch part one the first day, part two the second etc... as dvd #1 has part 1 and 2, and dvd #2 has part 3 and 4 respectivly, but I found Myself just watching all 4 parts approx 6 hours all in one sitting I was so hooked :) ... and seen MANY times over since!

 Even the intro music 'Dont Fear the Reaper' by Blue yster Cult was a really nice unexpected touch =)

 The pick for actors and actresses could not have been better. You can find a part of yourself in each charecter, good or evil. This movie is very psychological with many things to make you just sit and wonder for hours, even days after you seen it... and still find yourself watching it again, and again, and again...

 I know some were upset by Stephen King using alot of Christian emphases in the movie, but personally I thought it was a nice touch and done with extream good taste, and... it was His book/movie to do as He wished. Anyone who don't like it, write your own book with your own theme :P

 The movie starts with a military grade super flu that leaks out with no cure, which, could possably happen in real life. However no one knows why but a few are immune while everyone else dies leaving a small population of the human race left. While everyone is in the stage of dieing anarchy is everywhere among the people to the government declairing marshall law.

 This is just the very beginning as it deepens with the deaths of all the sick with the super flu aka captian trips by its so called west coast name in the movie.

 Soon, the survivors start having visions/dreams of 2 differant entities, one being an old black woman 'Mother Abigale', who represents all good trying to draw the suvivors to her area to start a new colony from G~d speaking to Her in dreams, and the other, a hippie type biker who you are led to belive is satan 'Randal Flagg', but thru out the whole movie he is never directly referd to as satan or the 'devil' to try and gain his following of people to start a differant colony. Stephen King did a superb job on this as there is no doubt this hippie biker in the desert is satan or 'the devil' but never actually referd to as such...

 As stated, the movie is extreamly psychological and you can find even a small trace of yourself in each person and even situation in one form or another, which really makes one think hard about many things, such as the survivors, both the good going onward to 'Mother Abigail' or the bad pilgramiging to 'Randal Flagg', not just the colonies they build later, but even the journies of each party as they slowly meet on the road and what happens to each while on their journeys to either colony...

 Still... theres even more, much much more yet to come, but Ill stop here... B-)

 A MUST see for anyone who has not seen this movie as you can find a part of yourself in this as well as just good entertainment even.

 My oppinion, this 'was/is/ever will be' the finest book made into a movie from Stephen King ever. If I could I would definatly give more then 5 stars except amazon.com limits to only 5 :P

 I may have to buy another back up copy of The Stand as Ive watched My version so much I think I actually wearing out the disks =)

581158,2,6303153461,"I mean ... like ... how dare they? The Stand is one of the most captivatingly dark, and fiendishly riveting stories ever written, and they turn it into a made for television movie? TELEVISION? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? You can't get away with a damn thing on TV anymore. At least not as far as Stephen King story elements are concerned. Naturally, some of the most deliciously gruesome, and wonderfully disgusting story elements had to be left out. Such as the scene where Rita Blakemoore (who's character was completely cut from the mini-series) chokes to death in her tent on her own vomit. Also, the detail of the superflu was toned down. The dream sequences cut short. The list goes on and on.

This brings an age-old question back to mind. Why in the hell does every single Stephen King mini-series have to air on ABC, huh? Why couldn't they have made this for HBO, instead? They would have had a hell of a lot more creative freedom, not to mention more time on their hands, and a more mature audience. It could have been five parts instead of only four, and all of the wonderfully crude, and ribald language could have been left in. Not like ABC, where Randall Flagg talks like a third grader. ""You look like kaka!"" Oh, please, give me a break!

This crap didn't quite ruin the book for me, but it came awful damn close. My advice to you folks is this: Read the book, and just pretend the movie doesn't exist. You'll be glad you did.

This is so complicated that I didn't think it could be coherently put to film...but it works. Acting is very good throughout, especially Jamey Sheridan as the bad guy (It's hard to watch ""Law & Order"" now.) He was THAT good. There are inside jokes, my favorite being the appearance of Joe Bob Briggs, who did a late-nite horror show and always said how much he hates Molly Ringwald. This is King's biggest novel...and I know he knows it's his best. The 8 hour TV version does well on DVD at only 6 hours (minus commercials). To tell the story in less time would be a travesty. The acting is generally fine, with Sheridan as a standout. I liked Ruby Dee a lot, and thought Rob Lowe was fine. A brief tough-as-nails cameo by Kathy Bates was great. Adam Storke, Ray Walston and Gary Sinese are also quite good. It's all so overwhelming, and beautifully conceived and presented.  I liked it a lot.",1094342400,8,1042,4.455497382198953

first of all...impressives:  I wish I could remember the actor's name, but whoever played Larry Underwood.  WOW!  Same for Ray Walston, Gary Sinise, Miguel Ferrera, and Ruby Dee.  Just terrific performances in key roles that truly grounded the performance.  Also, keeping the Las Vegas setting was terrific.  Not sure if they had to recreate downtown Vegas on a theater lot or actually managed to clear it out, but either way, got it perfect and it was necessary to keep essential story elements in place.  Jamey Sheridan as Randall Flagg also manages to delightfully chew up every scene he's in.

Unimpressed...Casting Rob Lowe as the Deaf-mute Nick Andros.  Wha?  OK...after the novelty of Rob Lowe not uttering any words wears off (About 5 minutes into his performance), it's as if he's just there to look pretty.  Combining the Characters of Rita and Nadine was unwise as well.  While Laura San giancomo does a good job with Nadine, Eliminating the character of Rita, who in my view is central in Larry Underwood's transition from Rock Demigogue to savior of humanity, was a poor choice of scripting.

As for SO WRONG...JUST SO VERY WRONG, casting Molly Ringwald as the central character Frannie?  Wha?  Frannie is a woman of unplumbed strength and resolve, and I would assume, some earty sexiness.  Molly Ringwald?  She really doesn't convey much of anything outside of bemused resignation.  Granted, she doesn't do an awful job with the part, but it's such a significant role that I felt it would have been better represented by like, Mary Stuart Masterson or even Mary Louise Parker.

581236,5,6303153461,"From the moment I first sat down to watch this miniseries in 1994 and heard the first few opening bars of ""Don't Fear the Reaper,"" I have loved this movie.  I have read every one of Stephen King's books and have seen most of the movies adapted from these books.  Some of the adaptations have been awful, others good, and a few, such as The Shawshank Redemption, truly great; The Stand definitely belongs in this elite latter category.  I have heard that some fans of King's novel were disappointed in this miniseries, but to me, what's not to like?
What really makes this movie work is the exceptional--and at times unconventional--casting.  The Stand was my first exposure to Gary Sinise, and I immediately fell in love with his perfect portrayal of Stu.  One of my teen idols, Rob Lowe, did an absolute amazing job with the role of Nick, proving that he had true range as an actor long before The West Wing came along.  I don't know why Adam Storke has not had more career success, as his personification of Larry Underwood was flawless.  And the supporting cast was nothing short of stellar:  terrific veteran actor Ray Walston as Glen Bateman, Bill Fagerbakke's sensitive portrayal of Tom Cullen, and Miguel Ferrar's perfectly desperate and despicable Lloyd Henried.  Although I would not have pictured Jamey Sheridan as Flagg, he definitely brought the character to life, striking a deft balance between Flagg's evil and humorous sides.  The one woefully miscast role was Molly Ringwald's Frannie--I don't think she was what King or anyone else had in mind for this character.  However, given that most of Ringwald's scenes are with Gary Sinise, this flaw is easily overlooked.
Fans of the novel will definitely notice some changes to the plot, but these modifications were obviously necessary to keep this epic story to just under 6 hours.  However, the feel and flavor of the work remain unaltered, as the purity of King's classic good versus evil tale clearly shines through.  Finally, the haunting musical score serves to heighten the emotion of this captivating film.  I have enjoyed repeated viewings of this miniseries over the years, and it has remained one of my all-time favorite movies.",1084492800,118,2202,4.900269541778976

581280,2,6303153461,"I just finished watching The Stand, all 6 hours of it, in two nights, (two disk set) and came away feeling disappointed.  It was like two movies spliced together.
The begining of the movie was strong, with a story line not too unbelievable.  With a man-made super virus or bacteria gone wrong and horribly slipping into the general public and erraticating 99% of the population.  From there it is all down hill.
The movie then goes into a good vs. evil mode, with the survivors of this horrible plague having some sort of mass hypnotic dream about an elderly woman in Nebraska, telling them to come to her, and an evil being hanging around the fringes of the dreams and in these survivors lifes.
The story line then becomes uninteresting with the ""characters"" and I mean unbelievable characters, traveling to Nebraska and then onto Colorado.
From the deaf mute meeting the mentally handicapped man, and teaming up, to the schitsophrenic woman leaving New York with her fellow male traveling companion, then abandoning him, because she has a dream about this fringe devil-man telling her to come to him.  She is all into being evil and doing harm to everyone, but when she finally meets this demon that she has been in the service of, and in some sort of love with, she is put off by him and kills herself. Stink, stink stink.
The whole good versus evil and religous undertone of the second half of the movie is bad.  The worst scene of all was the end with God's hand appearing in downtown Vegas, and igniting a nuclear warhead that has been brought into town by an evil pyro-lunatic. Thus erraticating all the evil people that the plague didn't get, and oh, yeah, the evil demon too.
One question for Mr. King. How does a nuclear bomb destroy an evil, underworld, supernatural, being who is not mortal???
Like I said, stink, stink, stink.
King should have stayed with the plague plot line, and expanded it to include what would have really happened in this kind of event. Like fresh food or hording of supplies and the struggles with the horrid realities of dealing with the thousands/millions of dead bodies in any city. The lice, flys, rats and unclean living conditions that would have brought on a real plague, and panic. Not just throwing the dead bodies out of a house you now claim as your own, or moving them to the side of the road. This movie also never touches what happened to the rest of the world.
This is a six hour movie, and there are plenty of plots and sub-plots.  I gave this a two star rating only because of the interesting beginning and the fine actors in this mini-series.

The acting was amazing, especially the performances by Gary Sinise (can that guy play a bad role? Knock on wood) and Rob Lowe, supposedly in a comeback role. It was probably very hard for poor Rob to play a deaf mute! Anyway, the story goes that a virus created by the Army gets loose at it's base and spreads through the United States. Only a few people survive, and the ones that do are separated into two groups. One group is called in dreams by Mother Abigail (played by Ruby Dee) and the other is called by Randall Flagg, the devil (played by Jamey Sheridan, who did an awesome job). Mother Abigail's group is led by Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Adam Storke, and Rob Lowe (although he didn't lead the group, he played an incredibly important part as a retarded man named Tom Cullen. I'm talking about Bill Fagerbakke). The bad guys, led by Flagg, flock to Las Vegas (yes, Sin City itself) and the good guys go to Boulder, Colorado. I won't give away the ending, but it is truly a wonderful movie with many twists and surprises. It made me jump, scream, say aww, and at times cry ew!

I have always been a big fan of Stepehen Kings movies but I thought the acting and characters were awefull in this film. From what Ive heard when talking to people that have read the book they say that the onscreen performances in this movie are nearly perfect. So while I didn't like the devil character he may very well have been do a great job. So if you read the book you should definately purchase this DVD becuase you will most likely love the adaptation. If you haven't read the book this movie may come off very cheesy.,1076803200,,603,4.206896551724138
581284,5,6303153461,"I'll be honest. I rented this movie expecting it to be terrible. I thought that mediocre would be a miracle in regards to this story. I didn't think it could be done in a miniseries format, or even a movie format due to the length of the tale.
I was dead wrong, and was pleasantly surprised. They were able to keep all the important scenes (and plenty of unimportant yet character building scenes) from the book while still keeping it fairly short (in comparison to the book).  Still probably a 2 session movie, but considering the length of the book its pretty amazing they were able to keep it as short as it was and tell the story so well.
The acting in this miniseries is very good, especially from Sinise, Sheridan, and Faggerbakke. Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald, Corin Nemec and Laura san Giacomo also are great in the movie. Its practically a who's who of late 80's up and comers.
The casting is great, most of the characters look close to how I pictured them when I read the book, and in a few instances, I think the actor was almost born for his part. Specifically Matt Frewer as the Trash Can Man and Miguel Ferrer as Lloyd. Both gave excellent performances that instead of changing how I thought of their characters only added to what I already had pictured in my mind.
But aside from surprisingly good acting and miracle casting, this movie did a great job adapting a very long and difficult novel. The Stand is NOT a horror story but rather a contemporary one with some elements of science fiction. The story centers on the survivors of a plague which kills 99% of the USA population. Most of them begin having pseudo-psychic dreams of either a motherly woman in Nebraska or a Mysterious male figure in the deserts of Nevada. Eventually the survivors come together as two communities lead by these semi-religious figures and the story goes from there. As you could imagine, traveling across the country when 99% of the population is gone could make for a movie in and of itself, but The Stand also covers how the characters set up a new society and what they eventually decide to do about the rival community ran by the bad man from their dreams.  I won't ramble on since a lot of the reviews mention the story, plus you could look up the book for more info, the movie follows it pretty closely.
Its a story of good and evil set in a future we can all imagine but hope never happens. Many have called it King's greatest work, and I think it is certainly in the top 5. However, a title that it does deserve is best screen adaptation (probably a tie with Kubrick's adaptation of ""the shining"") because this DVD is fantastic and won't dissapoint.
4.5 out of 5 stars.",1076457600,2,2671,4.482546201232033
581285,5,6303153461,"Okay, I'll admit it: I'm not much of a Stephen King fan. Horror has never been one of my favorite genres; you might say I even go out of my way to avoid it. Nevertheless, I've not only just started reading King's ""The Eyes of the Dragon,"" but I also recently watched Artisan Home Entertainment's 2-DVD set of ""Stephen King's The Stand.""
I haven't read either edition of the novel (yes, there are two versions: a slightly truncated 1978 edition and a 1990 ""Uncut and Unabridged"" re-release), nor had I seen the ABC miniseries when it aired 10 years ago, so I had no idea what to expect. But when my boyfriend purchased this after we watched ""The Return of the King"" at the movies, I knew I had two choices. Either I could sit in front of my computer playing ""Star Wars Monopoly"" or sit next to him and watch the first two parts of the four-part miniseries. Even though the idea of sitting in front of my PC and buying Star Wars real estate seemed mighty appealing, I opted to watch at least part of ""The Stand"".
To my surprise, I found myself enjoying the first episode, ""The Plague,"" during which a genetically engineered strain of influenza escapes from an Army lab and first kills most of the technicians, lab workers, and soldiers inside the Project Blue facility, then is unleashed upon an unsuspecting nation when a guard panics and spreads the virus when he attempts to flee with his wife and daughter. Within weeks, 99 percent of the world population is dead from the disease nicknamed ""Captain Trips.""
Now, in most stories this would be pretty much it; I mean, where can you go when you have killed off most of humanity? King's answer is that the end of the world is only the start of the story. Most of the novel, if I interpret the miniseries correctly, deals with the remaining one percent that is somehow left untouched by ""Captain Trips."" What is left of humanity divides itself into two opposing camps.
On one side, there are those who follow the Light side as personified by 106-year-old Mother Abigail (Ruby Dee) who lives on a small Nebraska farm. Through dreams, she gathers to her side Stu Redman (Gary Sinise), Larry Underwood (Adam Storke), Fran Goldsmith (Molly Ringwald), Glen Bateman (Ray Walston), Judge Farris (Ossie Davis), Tom Cullen (Bill Fagerbakke), and the deaf-mute Nick Andros (Rob Lowe). Guided, Mother Abigail says, by God, she leads this brave band to Boulder, Colorado, where they start trying to rebuild American society from scratch.
But where there is Light, there is Darkness. In this case, its human-like face is that of the demonic Randall Flagg ( Jamey Sheridan of Law & Order: Criminal Intent) who can change his form at will and yet exudes a certain charisma that attracts many followers, including Lloyd Henreid (Miguel Ferrer), the insane firebug Trashcan Man (Matt Frewer), the nasty and mean Julie Lawry (Shawnee Smith), a character I found totally repulsive (she tries to seduce Nick in a small town in Oklahoma, then she torments the mildly retarded Tom when Nick rejects her advances). This rotten bunch sets up shop in ""Sin City"" itself, Las Vegas, and under Flagg's leadership, promptly begins planning the demise of the Boulder Free Zone. This, of course, means that conflict is inevitable, and this time it is for keeps.
Even though King had to compress some of his huge novel to fit ABC's alloted time slot, and some characters are composites, The Stand is a well-written adaptation of a HUGE novel. Director Mick Garris keeps the story moving at a steady and nail biting pace. Even though there are a few spots where I wanted to go ""Ewwwwwww!"" the fact that the miniseries was made for broadcast television keeps the ""Yuck!"" factor to a minimum without lessening the power of the original horror classic's storyline.
As I said earlier, I am not as fond of King or his style of stories as my boyfriend is, yet not only did I watch the first episode, but I also sat through the entire 366 minute running time over two nights. I found it was enteraining, scary at times, and even thought-provoking. At least as far as the genetically engineered flu virus, it might leave you wondering ""Could THIS really happen?""",1074038400,13,4169,4.712328767123288
581286,4,6303153461,"Hailed as one of the best fantasy/horror novels ever written, Stephen King's The Stand has been published in two different versions -- a slimmed down original edition in 1978 and a slightly updated and unabridged version in 1991.  And although both stick to the same story -- a U.S. government-created strain of the flu wipes out 99% of humanity and the survivors join two opposing camps in the ultimate face-off between good and evil -- they differ somewhat, particularly at the very end.
Of all of King's novels, The Stand is the one most of his readers ask about or comment on, and until 1994, when ABC commissioned a miniseries based on this sprawling opus, one question always was ""Will there be a movie based on this one?""  (King replied in the foreword to the ""uncut and unabridged"" edition that he thought there might be...)
Unlike most of King's novels, the sheer scope of the novel guaranteed that The Stand would have to be a miniseries made for TV.  To have compressed the 1,000-plus pages into a three-hour movie would have been impossible without deleting many characters and situations, a very risky proposition since The Stand is to King's legions of fans what The Lord of the Rings is to Tolkien's readers. And to have hired someone else to adapt it from book to teleplay would have been a risky proposition, so ABC asked King to take the writing reins.
Happily, the 1994 ""Stephen King's The Stand"" turned out to be a marvelous miniseries, and while it did not break any Nielsen ratings as ""Alex Haley's Roots"" did in 1977, it did fairly well and earned many good reviews.
The Artisan Home Entertainment Special Edition DVD of ""Stephen King's The Stand"" presents the complete miniseries on two DVDs, with The Plague and The Dreams on Disc One and The Betrayal and The Stand on Disc Two.  Stripped of commercials and station identification/local news promos, the eight-hour running time is pared down to 366 minutes.
Parts One and Two (The Plague, The Dreams) deal with the accidental release of a super-deadly strain of the flu from a secret military laboratory known as Project Blue. Although the base's security attempts to lock down the facility before the virus escapes, one guard and panics attempts to flee, unwittingly infecting his wife and daughter and beginning a chain reaction that will lead to the deaths of millions.  Even so, a handful of people survive, and as they try to cope with the disaster and move on, they are guided by their dreams to join either the evil Randall Flagg  or the good 106-year-old Mother Abigail.  While Flagg sets up his police-state in Sin City itself, Las Vegas, the good guys (and gals) set up the Boulder Free Zone in Colorado...but this is only the setup for the darker conflict to come.
Parts Three and Four (The Betrayal, The Stand) describe the apocalyptic conflict between good and evil as Flagg's people race to acquire weapons of mass destruction to assure their demonic master's victory over the power of the Light side represented by the Boulder Free Zone.  Flagg, who was seen only in a few brief scenes in the first half, gets more airtime as the story finally focuses on the final conflict.  It's an old storytelling technique but it works well here, and Jamey Sheridan (Law & Order: Criminal Intent) plays the evil demon with a mixture of charm and menace.
Despite the leeway allowed by the miniseries format and unusually open-mindedness from ABC's Standards and Practices division, the teleplay more closely follows the 1978 version rather the 1991 edition, particularly in the ending.  King has to compress some parts here, combine some characters there to make the miniseries flow seamlessly and not go over budget (If ABC had commissioned a 12-hour teleplay, maybe the condensing would not have been necessary, but that's Monday-morning quarterbacking 10 years after the show aired).  Even so, The Stand captures the spirit of the novel brilliantly.
Credit is also due to director Mick Garris, who not only got great performances from such actors as Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Jamey Sheridan, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Ray Walston and Rob Lowe, but also kept the huge storyline from dragging or getting too heavy-handed on the gross-out scale.
 Even though Artisan did give The Stand the Special Edition treatment by adding such features as 2.0 Dolby Surround sound, a ""Making of"" featurette and commentary by King, Garris, some of the major cast and Editor Pat McMahon (just to name a few of the extras), it doesn't have easily accessed subtitles.  It does have closed captions, but for people with older models of TVs and non-standard players such as Xbox or Playstation 2 game systems that can also play DVDs this is not a very helpful option.",1073174400,233,4725,4.854658385093168

I guess you have preconceptions as to what people are like after reading a book and in this case it was Nadine, Harold and Nick that did not match my own.

I don't know why they almost always happen to be so bad, but they just do. The only one I thought was great was Pet Sematary, which the thought of still manages to scare me to this day. The movie isn't that scary anymore, but I still wouldn't watch it by myself. The idea behind it just creeps me out. It's probably because I'm an animal lover. I can't even stand any scary stories dealing with animals, well, it depends on what happens with the animals. Evil animals usually just scare me. Anyway, I also remember liking The Langoliers and Storm Of The Century. I haven't seen those for so long though that I have no idea how I'd feel about them now...
Also, am I the only one who felt like a chunk of this movie was missing in between part 2 and part 3? I could have swore I missed something, but I double checked, and I hadn't missed a thing. Since that's really how the movie went and I didn't miss anything, I really think the connection of the two parts was poorly put together. It just felt like something was missing, and I still can't get over it. It seemed like so many things happened between these two parts, and we aren't really explained anything.

The six hour movie does have some good actors and actresses, but Gary Sinise stands out above the rest. The plot takes you through many twists and turns, the first being any surivors of the plague, which we don't know if it ever reached other countries, although logic suggests that it did. It then takes you to a struggle between the forces of good and evil, ending badly for the evil people, but still leaving you like you've been cheated. The ending, which is a nuclear explosion, is very stupid and short.
The film is worth watching, that is, if you have the time and patience to watch it. ""The Stand,"" which probably would have been better off as a miniseries, is exactly what I said in the beginning... It's the same as every other Stephen King movie",1057881600,2,1018,4.391534391534392
581371,3,6303153461,"Maybe my mistake with The Stand was cramming it into three viewings instead of spreading it out into four like its initial television release. What started off brilliantly quickly got repetitive and boring during the second disk. Of course, the storyline in itself is fascinating. What if the world came to an end and all that was left was good and evil, forced to fight it out in an all or nothing battle? However, there are too many characters to keep track of, too many shifts in location, and way too much going on.
Stephen King films usually work well as a three-part miniseries, but the extra 90 minutes on this one was WAY too much. Two hours could have EASILY been cut from this, and the film would have been a lot stronger had that been the case. By Part 4, I just wanted it to be over, without really caring about what was going to happen. I was fascinated by the story, but the film itself was too slow and too boring. I really wish it had only been a 4 and a half hour film instead of a six hour one. I finished ""The Shining"" mini in one sitting and ""Rose Red"" in one and a half, but this was excruciating at parts and I had to keep stopping it and getting back to it later.
Despite everything, the cast is amazing and it's hard to believe the film was made almost 10 years ago. Most of the effects are great, and some are not, but it does have that television feel to it, which can easily be overlooked. The characters are as strong as the story, which is why I was so disappointed in the end.
The first 3 parts seemed to be leading to a great climactic showdown, but the ending disappoints, with Part 4 being the worst of the lot. The showdown was cheesy and the wrap-up  boring and sappy. So while The Stand has so many great things about it, in the end, it all falls short and ends up being pointless. I started off loving this, but I ended up hating it. See it if an edited version ever comes out, this one is just too much to sit through.",1055808000,2,1956,4.174603174603175
581441,5,6303153461,"Stephen King fanatics such as myself waited a long time to see a cinematic version of Stephen King's The Stand, the apocalyptic epic which many fans then and now consider King's masterpiece (although The Dark Tower series may have passed it in terms of importance to King's legacy).  Personally, I consider the novel It to be King's magnum opus, but The Stand naturally means a lot to me.  One wondered if a film version could ever be made that could do the original novel justice; certainly, King himself would not proceed with such a project until such time as he felt he could pull it off.  This six-hour miniseries is fantastic, due largely to King's hands-on overseeing of what can be called ""his baby.""  This was a massive undertaking, and it yielded a final product just about as good as it could possibly be.  The obvious truth is, though, that even this monumental film pales in comparison to the novel.  While the onset of the superflu and its horrifying effects is told extremely well and in great detail, other parts of the story are glossed over to some degree, particularly the activities in the Free Boulder Zone; more importantly, there simply isn't enough time to flesh out all of the important characters, and it is this unfortunate yet essentially unavoidable quandary that somewhat diminishes a fan's enjoyment of the story.
By and large, the casting is excellent.  Gary Sinise is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, and he essentially becomes Stu Redman in this production.  Jamey Sheridan is more than acceptable as Randall Flagg, Ray Walston is brilliant as Glen Bateman, Rob Lowe gives a powerful performance as deaf-mute Nick Andros, and Bill Fagerbakke oftentimes steals the show as the mentally challenged Tom Cullen.  Molly Ringwald is good, but she just didn't become the Frannie Goldsmith I had long ago created in my mind, her character becoming rather aggravating to me in the later segments of the production.  Laura San Giacomo really brought Nadine Cross to life, and the raw yet tapped sexual energy she brought to the role makes me think she could have tempted me over to the dark side without a heck of a lot of trouble.  Matt Frewer simply is Trash Can Man; it's just a pity that his character was not explored to the much more significant degree found in the novel.  The one character I have a problem with is that of Harold Lauder; Corin Nemec overdoes things a little early on, but the real problem is with the character more than the actor.  It's not simply a matter of Nemec not really looking like Lauder; the problem is that Nemec's character is thoroughly unlikable from the very start, whereas the Harold Lauder of the novel is someone I sympathized with to a significant degree (at least up until his little surprise parting gift to Boulder).  Of course, no discussion of the actors and actresses assembled here is complete without a chorus of praises sent Ruby Dee's way for her remarkable portrayal of 106-year-old Mother Abigail Freemantle.  I was shocked to learn that Ruby Dee was actually a vibrant, far from elderly woman.  One must also mention Stephen King's fine acting performance here, as he puts in much more than just a brief cameo appearance.
The Stand does have some weaknesses in terms of the special effects, notwithstanding the amazing makeup job on Ruby Dee.  While the explosions and decayed bodies are brought off quite well, the transformation of Flagg's face between human and demon leaves much to be desired, and some of the special effects at the climax of the film are not very impressive at all.  The way in which masses of dead bodies were displayed was quite effective, but I was a little bothered to see dead men and women hunched over buffet lines, poised in the seats of tractors in the field, etc.  ""Captain Trips"" was not some type of poison that killed you instantly; you suffered with the flu for some time before death came knocking, and I can't believe gravely sick people were doing some of the things they were purportedly doing when the end came.
In the final analysis, Stephen King's The Stand is far from perfect, and watching the miniseries is by no means a substitute for reading the epic novel.  You don't get a chance to really know these characters inside and out over the course of a mere six hours, and those who have not read the novel may question why some characters were even there in the film.  Still, The Stand represents a monumental achievement in miniseries and film production, and I for one am thankful that a network allowed King as much time as it did in order to bring the pages of his novel to life.  On a final note, the special feature about the making of The Stand is quite disappointing, coming in at just over five minutes in length.  This disappointment is offset to some degree, however, by the inclusion of commentary provided by Stephen King, director Mick Garris, and several of the actors.",1054339200,5,4927,4.723453908984831
581442,4,6303153461,"And ... if it ain't entertaining. This is easily one of the best TV-movies ever made. It's one of maybe three good Stephen King adaptations into film.
The casting is great. Tom Cullen is portrayed perfectly, as is most of the other characters. However, Cullen is the one that sticks out as the best.
Molly Ringwald, however, should never act again. She depresses me...
The SFX, too, are pretty bad. The 'Hand of God' is worthy of Ed Wood.
But the writing is excellent and there are sections of the film that terrify me. Of course, I do have a slight fear of germs and diseases, so that could be a part of it... That, and Jamie Sheridan is just a freaky-looking dude...",1054252800,,668,4.439024390243903
581443,4,6303153461,"This film is a mixed bag, but in the end the good elements outweigh the bad ones.  Let's start with the bad ones.
The story has to be significantly reduced to fit into six hours.  This is only a minor gripe, though, as it is impossible to make any book into a movie without losing at least a little bit, and it was King himself who wrote the teleplay, so we can rest assured that the story is represented as best as it could possibly be.  One thing that makes me cringe about the film is the special effects.  They are simply bad.  They look like they're from a saturday morning kids show, like Power Rangers or something.  One thing that kinda bothers me is that the movie was broadcast on ABC, so they were very limited in the way of language, violence etc.  this doesn't really take away from the film, as the filmmakers did an excellent job with what they were able to do, but it does make me wonder what the film could have been like with an R rating.  it is, after all, Stephen King.  I think my major gripe, the thing that makes me cringe the most when i watch it, is some of the casting.  the casting in some places is absolutely wonderful (Gary Sinise), but then in other places is absolutely terrible.  Harold's character could have been cast much better. Laura San Giacomo, while she did a good job, just didn't seem right for the role of Nadine... she just didn't LOOK anything like the character is described in the book.  and, of course, the most monumental bit of miscasting, Molly Ringwald as Fran.  When i found out Frannie was being played by her i shuddered and laughed at the same time.  Not only does she not fit the part at all, but she's just plain a bad actress.  admittely i've only seen her in one other film, so i could be wrong, but based on the two i've seen her in... yikes.
Well, that's it for the bad stuff, now on to the good.  I was just talking about casting, so i'll continue with that.  When you talk about the casting in this movie (the good casting anyway) it's ALL about ONE man: Gary Sinise.  After seeing his portrayal of Stu, i simply can't imagine ANYONE else in that role.  This is an example of sheer casting brilliance.  he is simply a great (and very underrated) actor.  Another cringing moment came when i found out that the part of Nick was played by... *gulp*... Rob Lowe.  But as it turned out, he did an excellent job.  In the book, Nick was one of the strongest and most likable characters, and Lowe really captures that.  Granted, playing a deaf mute he didn't have to learn any lines, but he was really able to convey a great deal with his actions and facial expressions.  The guy (sorry, can't remember his name)who played Tom Cullen, was another example of great casting.  The fact that Stephen King wrote the teleplay and was executive producer was a big boost too.  i cringe (once again) at the thought of someone else making the necessary cuts to the story, because there simply isn't anyone else who could have done it better than the writer himself.  The film's pacing is good, and the filmmakers do a good job of weaving the characters' stories throughout the first two parts without confusion.  Makeup was good(it is entirely possible to watch the whole thing without knowing that the actress plaing Mother Abigail isn't really old) but i think they went a little overboard with Flagg.  His character, i think, would have been much more chilling without the use of the ""devil"" masks.
All in all, i'd give it a solid 4 stars.  it's certainly not without its flaws, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and you'll forget that the movie you're watching is made-for-tv.",1053993600,2,3645,4.427927927927928

581445,3,6303153461,"First Off the Book is my favorite work of fiction. The movie itself is entertaining but had several things about it that I didn't like. If you liked the book and have never seen the movie don't get your hopes up too much. To condense a book that's over 1100 pages long into a 6 hour series required them to strip away all elements of the story except those that were absolutely necessary to keep the story intact. The original story IS there, and the basic idea of the film is carried out enough so that the good vs evil story is presented and carried to it's conclusion. However many plot elements that gave the book such a broad range of story are not in the film. Sure what isn't there doesn't really take away from the story but in the book it added a huge depth to it. Things like Harold Lauder painting directions on the tops of barn roofs to tell travelers where he and Frannie are, Larry Underwood's lonely trip through New England, student riots in campuses, free zone committee meetings, Trashcan man's trip to Las Vegas and his encounter with the psychotic Kid. Things like that, that add a huge sense of character to the people in the book are not there. Now as a stand alone film it's great to watch and is enjoyable. The actor performances are great, especially at the film's climax. But Stephen King's works have always had a huge sense of story. This is in the film somewhat but not the way it is in the book. By itself it's a good film but not one that does the book justice. What would have been better was if it had been an HBO mini series. Perhaps that would have been better.",1050969600,,1596,4.323333333333333
581446,5,6303153461,"As Stephen King himself has said, The Stand is taken straight out of the Book of Revelations in the Bible, and this, in my opinion, makes the miniseries a classic tale of good versus evil.  With nearly all the world's population dead due to a genetically engineered virus, the survivors begin to coalesce into two groups--one led by the benevolent Mother Abagail, and the other by the demonic Randall Flagg.  It might seem through the first 3 parts of the miniseries that Flagg's group are in the ascendancy, but Mother Abagail & Co. have quite a few tricks up their sleeves.
The crop of actors in Stephen King's The Stand were a great bunch as well.  Gary Sinise was perfect for the part of Stu Redman, the country boy from small-town Texas, and Molly Ringwald as Fran Goldsmith was very good.  Adam Storke made a very believable Larry Underwood, and the casting of Coach's Bill Fagerbakke as Tom Cullen was an inspired choice.  I especially loved the late Ray Walston as Glen Bateman, Jamey Sheridan as Flagg, Ruby Dee and her husband Ossie Davis in their respective parts of Mother Abagail and Judge Farris, Rob Lowe as Nick Andros, Just Shoot Me's Laura San Giacomo as Nadine Cross, the late Rosemary Clooney's son Miguel Ferrer as Lloyd Henreid, and Max Headroom's Matt Frewer as Trashcan Man.  I had no complaints about Stargate SG-1's Corin (Corky) Nemec as Harold Lauder except for the fact that they could have plumped him out a bit for the part and had him lose weight so he'd be slender once he got to Boulder.  Other than that, his acting was excellent.
I'd also like to give a nod to two very wonderful actors whose parts were uncredited, but who nevertheless made a valuable contribution to the story: Apollo 13's Ed Harris as General Starkey, the commander of Blue Base (where the virus is made) and Misery's Kathy Bates as talk-radio host Rae Flowers, whose refusal to withhold the truth from the American people earns her a bullet in the head.  Although you only see them in Part 1 of the miniseries, their roles were brilliantly acted and necessary to the story.
The Making of Stephen King's The Stand documentary, included on both DVD and VHS, gave some good insights into the filming of this wonderfully scary miniseries.  When I found out how much work had gone into making it, I was astonished, and when I discovered that hundreds of King fans had flocked to Vegas for some of the crowd scenes there, I found myself turning green with envy.  I wish I had been there...  The DVD also includes commentary by the principal actors and crew as well as Stephen King himself, along with a Make-Up Effects gallery, which includes Randall Flagg's transformations and the old-age makeup used on Ruby Dee as Mother Abagail.
All in all, Stephen King's The Stand is a keeper.  It'll scare the living daylights out of you, but you'll want to watch it over and over.",1044921600,68,2873,4.6561264822134385

When the majority of the Earth is wiped out by a mysterious plague, the remaining survivors form two factions: one led by a kind old woman, the other led by some strange demon.

Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, and Rob Lowe played their roles very well as far as I was concerned.  I was disappointed with the way the Darkman (aka Randall Flagg) turned out to be on screen.  He was very creepy in the book, but on film he came across pretty much as being a joke.  The plague itself was spookier than Flagg turned out to be.

""Way Off the Mark"" awards/raspberries go to Molly Ringwald (by the way, she's a natural brunette, not a red head, who died her hair darker brown/black for the film) - she had a promising start during the death scene of her father, but then just deteriorated into rote acting.

  The movie was equally wonderful in its abitlity to transport a watcher just as easily as a book. It was an event worth watching along with other SK movies (SK Movie Marathon on USA in June). I hardly missed a moment.

Harold is supposed to be fat and pimply!  Corin Nemic is skinny and had three fake looking pimples for about two scenes.

Six hours of watching does fly, but if you are like me, once you start it, you are committed for the full six.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that some of the acting is sub-par. Maybe another reason is that I would have cast some of the characters differently. I think that the character of Randall Flagg has Christopher Walken written all over it. I always pictured Robert Duvall as Glen Bateman. But when I saw the characters of Tom Cullen and Nadine Cross, they were exactly as how I pictured them in the book. Gary Sinese was the perfect call for Stu Redman, but Molly Ringwald as Frannie, no way!

The extras are kind of lame, but like I said, this was no Hollywood blockbuster.",1011052800,4,1227,4.181434599156118
581696,4,6303153461,"I won't get into the plot, since every review has covered it.  The only pick I had was the corpses.  If you watch closely, you will find one poor guy sitting in a laundromat in Boulder, his mouth a gaping maw.  Then I see him again in Idaho, sitting in a cafe, along with a corpse I had seen in the church (also in Boulder).  These corpse had a bad case of wanderlust, it seems.
I enjoyed the movie so much that I spent $100 for the VHS set when it first came out.  The actors and actresses of the major characters held a great performance.  The cinematography of the southwest, especially Utah, was beautiful.  You receive the same quality on the DVD, which also includes the Behind-the-Scenes and Make-Up Effects, plus Storyboard Comparisons.
The DVD comes in Fullscreen, 2.0 Dolby Surround.  I wasn't able to take advantage of the Surround, since my player didn't come with speakers.  Despite that, the sound was better than the VHS.  Also included is a trivia booklet.  That, I found, was no big deal.  The rest, I continue to enjoy.  Highly recommended.",1010534400,4,1058,4.5638297872340425
581697,5,6303153461,"This movie is one of the few Stephen King films that stays true to the novel on which it is based.  It is a long film, but it has a lot of story to cover.
If you're unfamiliar with the story, in a nutshell, there is a horrible disease that spreads throughout America, and presumably the world (although that isn't made clear in either the book or the film), and basically everyone dies.  Only 1 percent of the population survives, and over time they meet up.  It soon becomes a battle of good versus evil.
This is a particularly poignant film now, given the recent events of September 11th, and the anthrax scare.  It gives the viewer much to think about how they would handle themselves in the same situation- a possibility made all the more real in our new world at war.",1010361600,,772,4.3776223776223775
581698,3,6303153461,"Since this movie is based on a novel that is over a 1000 pages long in paperback, so they had to cut quite a few scenes, characters and situations from it. This movie is pretty long as it is... some of the cuts made were predictable, such as Stu's group encounter with the 'zoo' (if you're wondering what that is - read the book!). But as it is, we don't get to see all the characters develop as they are in the book. Larry's character in the bppk, for instance, had changed from being a selfish young man who had only thought about himself, to a responsible adult. The movie doesn't give us a reason to understand why Larry was chosen over many other, seemingly equal people, to serve in the Free Zone committee, but in the book, even though we don't see him lead his group to Boluder, we hear enough to understand that he has leadership qualities in him. Another example would be Harold's character - he was a fat geek that was laughed at in school and treated as an outcast even by his parents, who obviously loved his sister Amy much better. Add to that the fact that Amy was Frannie's best friend and both were part of the popular crowd, and you see a much stronger motivation for Harold for wanting to impress Frannie, and having her for himself. This isn't a crush, as the movie tries to portray, but for Harold Frannie is a symbol of all he was missing before the plague, and now that things have changed, he wants to get. In the book, you get a much better sense of why Harold is so angry and eventually turns against the zone. When he finally seems to have a chance to change things - he's gotten Frannie's attention and appreciation for the way he handles the post - plague world - Stu and Glen come in, and he's no longer the center of things. This is how he feels about not being included in the Free Zone committee - after proving his resourcefulness on the trip to Boulder. Only before he dies does the book version Harold realize that he had a potential place as an important figure in the community if he hadn't 'turned bad'.
This brings me to the 2nd reason for disliking this movie: Molly Ringwald as Frannie. Her shoulder length black dyed hair is awful, especially since the book version Frannie is a read head, just like Molly... But this is a minor detail compared to what she did with Frannie: instead of a resourceful young woman, we get a stupid, silly girl who only cares about chasing Stu and wearing pretty clothes (that are not very practicall for a long trip on a motorcycle, by the way). When she reacts to Mother Abagail's request that the 4 men walk to Las Vegas, we see the reaction of a spoiled child, not the reaction of a strong minded young woman who is about to have a baby, and wants her loved one around then. We don't see her changing attitudes towards Harold: from thinking of him as a rude & dirty minded geek in the pre plague days to admiring his resourcefullness, then to fearing his reaction to her & Stu's relationship, then to a creepy feeling when she sees how he deals with it... These are only some examples of many things that Frannie goes through, but Molly Ringwald doesn't portray very well well. All other actors and actresses had to deal with the limitations of the cut script, but luckily for us viewers, only Molly Ringwald had a problem dealing with her character... Another feminine mis portrayed character is Nadine Cross, even though the casting for her was perfrct. Actually, the movie version Nadine was a combination of 2 characters in the book: the sophisticated New Yorker Rita Blakemoore,who eventually 'ran out' on Larry by ODing on pills (and this being a turning point for Larry), and Nadine Cross, a woman he had met on the way. Since the book version of Nadine was not commited to being the sophisticated New Yorker, we are introduced to her as a quiet & good woman (she's the one who found Joe, and took care of him at first, not Lucy), but then learn she's haunted by the Dark Man since childhood, and is slowly being drawn to him. We understand her dislike for going to Nebraska and her death a lot better in this light...
I had a huge problem with the commentary. It's obvious that it's been done in a few sessions, because a few of the stories (especially Ruby Dee's husband getting the role of Judge Ferris) were repeated over and over again. Also, towards the end, a few of the scenes had any commentary in them, and the little there was to say was over discussed and over analyzed. I understand it's hard to do a commentary for such a long movie, so maybe they should have had another 'extra' of commentary on certain scenes or characters instead of having one over the whole movie. Another problem, common to quite a lot of DVD commentaries that are done by more than one person is the constant babble of how great everyone was, etc. There were very few enlightening bits of information, such as Rob Lowe's explanation of how he prepared for the role of Nick.",1009843200,4,4945,4.435164835164835
581699,4,6303153461,"This is probably the only good made-for-TV movie that I have ever seen, especially for a SK adaption.  I'm just a little biased because I read the Complete and Uncut edition of the book, which rocked beyond belief, but aside from the scenes before everybody gets sick and dies, I haven't found much fault with the flick; the acting was mostly great, the book-to-film conversion was handled very well...my younger brother watched the film with me and started habitually to chant Trashcan Man's trademark phrase (see title).
For the acting, Gary Sinise and Rob Lowe were great, and the guys who played Larry, Glen, Tom Cullen, Lloyd, Randall Flagg, and Mother Abagail were truly talented.  I enjoyed Kathy Bates' short cameo as the disc jockey that has a disagreement with the U.S. Marine Corps, which leads, sadly, to her untimely demise; speaking of cameos, Stephen King takes a shot at acting as one of the residents of Boulder, Colorado.  He wasn't as annoying as some people say he was, but the Southern-hick accent was WAY overdone-- isn't he a Maine resident?  However, there were some characters that I could not put up with at all- on top of the list was Molly Ringwald with her hair dyed black, miscast as Frannie Goldsmith.  When I read the book, I invisioned Fran as a natural leader, not a dumb blonde without blond hair (Personally, I think that there should be a federal law that limits movie casts to only ONE former brat-pack member).  Others that I didn't especially like were Nadine and Harold, namely because Nadine was portrayed accurately but just so freaking creepy. Harold was kind of miscast, and in the movie is just a tall, skinny kid that is insecure and easily manipulated.  In the book, Harold was the apotheosis of nerdiness; he was fat, his face was bathed in acne, he talked like an arrogant prick, he thought that everyone else was dumber than him...and then, when he falls under Nadine's influence and all these detriments are erased, he writes his growingly psycotic thoughts in his ledger.  As he lies dying by the side of the road, he writes an extended essay about the reasons for the things he has done.  In the movie, he writes ""Sorry I was misled"" on a piece of paper and sticks it to his chest.  I realize that lots of stuff had to be left out of the movie, but Harold's devious intentions were not explained well enough.  As for the extras, particularily Stu's late neighbors and the scientists at the Stovington's Center for Disease... well, I think that in terms of acting, the film had two opposing camps: the good actors, which all survive the plague to a point, and the ones that suck, which, with the exception of Molly Ringwald, die off so that the director doesn't have to worry about them.
As for the setting, I thought that the scenery was really great, except for the fact that during the bleak, dark scenes in which dead bodies lay strewn about the streets, more often than not the sun is shining brightly, which detracts from the mood.  I expected to see cityscapes ravaged by fires and explosions caused by the dying victims of the plague, but I only saw New York City burning from a distance as Larry Underwood watches...in broad, happy daylight.  However, I loved the part where Stu, Larry, Ralph, and Glen are crossing the countryside to Las Vegas; the mountains and the fields they see on the way are filmed beautifully.
...Jeez, this is kind of a long review.  Bottom Line: The Stand is superb.  Don't be afraid to see it just because it is a Stephen King adaptation.",1007337600,10,3528,4.658615136876007
581700,4,6303153461,"This is a LONG movie...be warned. I also recommend you read the book The Stand first, or you might get lost, or find some characters and situations underdeveloped. I like to think of the book as the real deal, and this movie as a ""clipped"" version, telling the story's highlights. It's an 8 hour highlight reel. It looks pretty but has some claustrophobic low-budget cinematography. The acting and casting are good (I HATE their Frannie, though.) You'll like it more if you already know the story, weird as that sounds. The story is more religious than gory, but it's not PREACHY religious like many other terrible movies. It could have used more budget to make a spookier post-apocalypse world.
The DVD has some decent features, like production notes, commentary (haven't gotten that feature to work yet), some photos and the like. I wish it had some of the AWESOME bluegrass soundtrack on it. I mean, it's one of the best movie tracks I've ever heard.
Overall, I rank the movie ***, not exceptionally great or a must see (if it was ""real"" I'd give it more), and an extra * for the surprising amount of DVD features (considering this was made for TV.)",1003881600,,1152,4.679802955665025

While I usually find that the movie doesn't measure up to the book, I thought that this mini-series was very well done.  I think The Stand ranks right up there as my favorite Stephen King story, though Salem's Lot was the book that got me hooked on Stephen King.  I suppose it helped that I was living in North Berwick, ME, when I read the book.  There is a house in town, right on the main drag, that *looked* to be haunted when I first saw it, and I later found out that it was reputed by the locals to be haunted.  It was a run down, decrepit, and scary-looking Victorian.  According to an article in the Portland Press Herald, King was living in N. Berwick when he wrote Salem's Lot, and based the Marsden House on that very house!  I was disappointed to learn, a few years after moving from N. Berwick to Mass., that the house had been fixed up, painted PINK, and turned into elderly housing!  A perfectly good haunted house gone to ""waste"". 8^)  A year or so ago, I read that Salem's Lot was actually based on *another* town, and the house was based on a completely different house, but who knows?  I guess it shows that legends are already surfacing about King even during his lifetime!",1003363200,,1349,4.356
581702,4,6303153461,"There have been many references in these reviews to how the movie failed to live up to the book. Some things are too obvious to waste time saying, but if you must, go ahead. A movie is merely a spectator sport, a GOOD book is interactive. While reading the book, if you did not jump the first time you heard a sneeze, you were not paying attention! A movie never involves you to that degree. With regards to his ending, it is entirely consistant with what seems to be his moral compass at that time. Go back to Fire Starter, The Dead Zone, Salem's Lot, and you will see the same theme: Evil is everywhere. Good can overcome Evil, but Good must be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. When I read the book the first time it seemed that the death of Larry and the guys was their answer to the question ""How far will you go?"" Answer: All the way. Perhaps Mr. King's Methodist upbringing? Just a guess. This view seemed to change with Christine: some Evil is so great that nothing will vanquish it.
The edited version of the book is a classic. The unabridged version displays the need for discipline in an author's life. The movie is enjoyable on it's own terms.",1000425600,,1162,4.3842592592592595

I am a big fan of Stephen King, and I have read most of his novels, well the Stand was his best in writing, and now on film.

581796,2,6303153461,"""laws yes"" this movie kept going and going and going. The Stand takes a theme, viral fallout, which is absolutely bursting with the potential for an engrossing storyline and a phenominal set and never manages to reach any of it.  The Stand is filled with so much fluff that doesn't advance the storyline that it becomes difficult to remain interested. Some of the special effects are also very cheesy, such as the ""hand of god"" and the ghost of mother abigail which appears in the maternity ward (more of a bust. why would a ghost be cut off directly below the shoulders in a straight line?). Stephen King himself manages to drag this movie down even further by giving himself an acting role in which he displays the poorest acting I've seen since Steven Seagal arrived in Hollywood. Apparently Stephen is either completely oblivious to the fact that his acting is horrendous or he's so obsessed with appearing in movies he doesn't care. There are also numerous contradictions and inconsistancies. After the fallout, for example, when the people in FreeZone have congregated, they continue to eat reasonably well. Steaks, vegetables, etc. I'm assuming that a month after the fallout, the food in the grocery stores would have spoiled as well as food in people's homes. And so if all food has spoiled and 99% of America is dead, where is this food coming from? Farmers are dead, distributors are dead, yet this merry crew is eating like it's a Thanksgiving jamboree. Also, the virus is supposed to come on gradually mimicking a bad flu. Yet they keep finding bodies in the most inconceivable places. Who goes to a diner when you have a flu?  As for the set, it's breathtakingly beautiful in its rural splendor. Unfortunately, natural, scenic splendor does little to add to the macabre mood that should befit a viral fallout that's killed 99% of the population. When I rented this movie, all 4 tapes (2 tapes for Part 1, 2 for Part 2), it was actually in the horror section with a horror sticker on it. There was nothing remotely frightening about this film other than the general topic it was addressing. I also felt it was unnecessarily riddled with Christian connotations. It wasn't so much about good vs evil as King purports but about God vs Satan, with constant references to the Bible and religious this and religious that. It seemed like a Billy Graham sponsored film. The ending was perhaps the biggest copout of all. As a previous reviewer said, the men from the FreeZone pointlessly travelled to Vegas only to have a mysterious hand of God end the whole ordeal.

581797,5,6303153461,"Stephen King's book THE STAND was wonderfully adapted to film in the made for tv miniseries.  I bought the DVD as soon as it became available - it is one of my favorite films.  I loved the performance of Jamey Sheridan as Flagg (he has such an evil handsome grin) he was perfectly cast.  Gary Sinise as Stu Redman and Rob Lowe as Nick Andros were also wonderful choices to fill the large shoes created by Mr. King- not everyone could have done it so well.  There are more Ruby Dee, Ray Walston, Molly Ringwald (I like her performance, contrary to many people) and Laura San Giacomo (?) but you can't mention them all.  (Oh- don't forget that King makes several appearances in this one- not just a brief glimpse.)  The Stand is a book which is so long and detailed that there is no way it could have all been put into the film but Mr. King did an extraordinary job of compacting it into the time constrains of t.v.  The nice thing about owing the DVD is that you can jump to favorite scenes or past ones you may not like so easily.  As I said this is one of my favorite movies, I have watched it a several times and read the un-cut verion of the book twice and the short version once.  It is worth the time and money.

581798,5,6303153461,"If you read the book, you noticed that the above spelling was character Tom Cullen's spelling for any word or phrase, and King kept that in for this film. Say what you want--this miniseries came out quite awhile after the viewing public got bored with epics like ""Roots"", ""Shogun"", ""V"" and ""Winds Of War"". Actually, the viewers had lost their taste for any TV movie that ran more than two nights. As a matter of fact, that's the current definition of the term ""miniseries"": a two-part movie. The fact that this one is twice that and still ran--indeed that it's still in print--is a testament to its quality. There's some miscasting to be sure--I can't see Molly Ringwald as Frannie--but Ruby Dee as Mother Abagail more than counterbalances it. As does Ray Walston as Glen Bateman. And Matt Frewer has always been good at playing wackos, so he is a natural for Trashcan Man. Some scenes had to be trimmed from the book or it would have ended up as a twelve-parter--after ""War and Remembrance"", I think they must have passed a law or something. Some characters have been combined (like Rita Blakemoor and Nadine Cross) for brevity, but all in all, Stephen King films have always been among the closest to the book version as you can get. After all, as a contrast, only a few James Bond movies have even been close to their print counterparts. With that in mind, who would scrap a scene as powerful as the meeting of deaf mute Nick Andros and Mother Abagail? When Nick's comment about not believing in God is relayed to the devout old lady, she laughs and says; ""That doesn't matter--He believes in you.""",996105600,7,1601,4.621052631578947

Are you seriously telling me that this made for t.v. movie with the guy from Coach in it is better than Morgan Freeman and company?  I'm not saying that the Stand was terrible or anything, in fact it happens to be my favorite book written by Mr. King.  But come on I am begging you, Molly Ringwald was not that character and if you read the book you have to agree.  The love story between her character and the Gary Sinese charater was so heart warming and believable in the book.  Everytime I read it I cried at the thought of him dying from being left with his broken leg because I felt for the characters.  Molly Ringwald and Gary Sinese (who I thought was wonderful in other things) have about as much chemistry as two wet rags. I agree it did well for what it was, and the basic story was there.

What made it even better was the fact that Stephen King wrote the screenplay for the movie -- something which he has not been able to do very often. All the movies, from his works, which he has written the screenplay have contained all the most important aspects of his work.  The evidence is plain to see, here in ""The Stand"". Although he couldn't incorporate all the sub-plots from his original story, he had selected the most important of all -- thus making it the most even-handed display of the story. The direction, casting, FX, and, for me, most importantly, the music, was superb! Gary Sinese as ""Stu Redman"", Ruby Dee as ""Mother Abagail"", Rob Lowe as ""Nick Andros"", Ray Walston as ""The Professor"" -- I could go on and on -- all portrayed their parts with obvious feeling, giving depth to their characters. The haunting melody of ""Mother Abagail's Theme"" never fails to bring a tear to my eye!  Further, I would recommend reading the book before you see this movie; it will ""fill in the details and sub-plots"" which could not be represented.

Having recently purchased the video package and watched it in its entirity I had to look at what other people thought of the film.  I wasn't surprised to see a somewhat polarization acceptance of the film.  In any film adaption of a book you have a chance of disillussioning some readers.  However I have just 1 word for those of you who absoulty hate this film and think its one of the worst Stephen King films ever.....Langoliers...*shudder*...Well simply put some books aren't made to be translated into film (The Langoliers for example)...and others like The Stand is epic in scope, and by the shear size of the task is difficult to undertake.  The Stand does well under these circumstances and especially for being made under tv standards.
I'm not a relgious person by any deffinition but by Kings own admission The Stand was his view on the end of the world and barrowed heavily from themes of the Bible.  Its hard not to see these items (Flaggs ""gifts"" of dark beads and the way the beast marks his followers etc etc).  However it isn't as heavy handed nor preachy as some other end of the world televangists movies like ""Left Behind"" .  Not that theres anything wrong with these movies however they obviously have a message while The Stand is more of entertainment with some insight into a living breathing ""end of the world"".  Excuse the pun.  However there are some flaws to it.  Namely the ending.  As most of the moderate reviewers have noted.  However all in all it is worth your 20$ and 6 hours of your time.

Laura San Giacomo.

I thought that this was the best performance of Rob Lowe's career and all the characters were very well cast!  I actually liked Molly Ringwald (I know some didn't).  The Rita/Nadine thing bugs me a little bit but I certainly understand there is no way to put everything into a movie.  Stephen Kings books are so deep and detailed it would be virtually impossible.

The interpretation given by the actors was excellent - especially Gary Sinise as Stu Redman.  (Once I saw Gary in this I knew he was headed for bigger things and he did.)  It did a good job of bringing the book to life even though it cut some corners with the whole Rita/Nadine thing and the exclusion of The Kid.  The only complaint I have is of Molly Ringwald.  She just didn't make me see her as Frannie.  To this day it still annoys me when I watch it when she and Gary have their big kissing scene in the woods and she looks up at him and her eyes are crossed.

There are a few things that I don't like about the movie though.  First of all, what is the deal with both the rat man and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Them being in the movie is just silly.  Also, some of the special effects are pretty bad.  Some other good points of the movie are that I think that Rob Lowe played a perfect Nick Andros, and Other characters such as Randal Flagg and Trash can man are played very well.

Therefore, I tried to watch it with a positive attitude, but I must admit it was lacking the character depth (and some of the characters) that made the book so great. Where was Rita? She was a driving force for Larry, and she should have been in there somewhere. And Joe! He was such an interesting character, and yet he had about 5 minutes of screen time.  The biggest mistake they made was casting Corin Nemic as Harold. He was supposed to be a genius, not a nerd, and he was fat, whereas Nemic was skinny as a rail.  There were pluses, though. Rob Lowe was excellent as Nick Andros, and I had high expectations for him as he is my favorite character. Jamey Sheridan was acceptable as Flagg, though he wasn't exactly as I pictured him. The ending still left me in tears.  If you liked the book, then you probably shouldn't see the movie. There are just too many missing elements.",974851200,,1011,4.310526315789474

The movie grabs you from that first scene and doesn't stop for 6 hours. As a major fan of the author I couldn't imagine a more perfect adaption. I've read the book 5 times, and each time feel as though I've been transported into that world.
In typical King fashion a bizarre twist has the author himself playing a ""Body Bagging, Gravedigger"" of sorts in his film. A terrifying what if story, it's a MUST WATCH for fans, and non fans alike.",973641600,3,598,4.396396396396397

It is one of my all time favorite movies. I have seen it at least a dozen times. The plot is simply the best that King has ever come up with. The acting from Gary Sinse, Rob Lowe, and Mick Garris are incredible.
The movie is about a plauge that sweeps out of control. It starts out as a small problem in Texas, but soon goes out of control around the globe. It kills off more that 99% of the world's population. Little do the survivors know that this genocide was really just to set the stage for the biggest battle between good and evil in the history of our universe. The survivors must choose sides: Some follow an old lady, representing god and all that is good. Some follow Randall Flagg, the devil himself.
Randall Flagg is easily one of the best King characters ever. He is funny, scary, enjoyable, and hated all at the same time. Sometimes you will laugh at what he says, and sometimes you will scream when you see some of the awful things he does. He is potrayed so greatly in this film.
If you are a King fan, don't pass up this movie. It is over 6 hours long, but it will NEVER get boring. You may never see a better movie in your life.",973296000,4,1303,4.154150197628459

It is really a novel that engages you and lets you escape while you read it. So when I heard it was going to be put on television I was horrified. How this could not be on the silver screen and rated R was beyond me. I must say that they did as good a job as possible. Jamey Sheridan was terrific and Molly Ringwald was terrible. The rest of the casting worked well. They had to cut corners: no Kid, no Frannie and mother scenes, Nadine in NYC??? I expected that and lived with it. If you realize that movie adaptations are very seldom what you picture in your mind when you read a book, you can accept this work. (Read the Firm and then watch the movie or Bonfire of the Vanities for extreme examples.) I feel they did a pretty good job putting this on TV. I will always read the book every few years...it is escapism I feel I deserve...as per the movie, of course it's not as good as the book, but I must admit they handled an overwhelming work very well and I would watch this anytime.

All in all, I'd say they did a fair job of bringing a lengthy  complex story to the small screen.  The filmed version of a novel is never  as good as the book, simply because of time constraints.  The depth of the  characters, particularly of Larry and Harold, were glossed over, in my  opinion.
My main complaints are with the casting.  I have read most of  the reviews from other viewers, and I have to disagree strongly with some  who say that Laura San Giancomo made an excellent Nadine. If you've read  the book, you have to say that she did not capture the character at ALL.  Not only did she not physically look like the character is described  (Nadine was tall and imposing, physically striking, and Ms. San Giancomo is  petite), she totally missed the complex emotional internal struggle that  Nadine went through as she became aware of her destiny to be Flagg's  bride.
I also thought Molly Ringwald was totally WRONG as Frannie, and  that Corin Nemic just didn't capture Harold, not only physically (Harold is  a fat, brilliant social outcast; the filmed version just makes him out to  be a nerd), but also the complex and pathetic loser that Harold was.

If this  movie was made, lets say now, with a big budget, I believe that it could be  far more successful than the Green Mile. I could not even watch Molly  Ringwald without covering my eyes and waiting for it to be over. Otherwise,  the casting was exceptional. Sinise was okay, but somebody more Micheal  Keaton would've done better. Jamie Sheridan played an outstanding Randall  Flagg, but his costume for when he turned into a beast sucked. That could  have been aided with special effects and better make up. But if you are  going to buy this movie no matter what, I suggest that you don't read the  book.

Some of the things the  movie cuts down on to save time are: we lose Rita completely, and instead  introduces Nadine to Larry in New York, we know nothing of 'the Kid' and  Trashys journey to the walkin' dude, and Lucy and Joe are abbreviated into  the background. We also lose the heroine in Frannie because we know nothing  of the abusive treatment she received from her mother. She does not convey  to us any grief over the loss of her father; nor are any of her concerns  for her unborn child mentioned.

Many others have outlined the plot, so I won't bore you with that -- read their reviews.
What I would like to touch on is the careful adherence to the  novels that the movie maintains. Most film adaptations basically rewrite  the story, making the film and the book two different entities. Such is not  the case here. If you see the film, you know what the book is about. I  regard that as a plus.
Character detail. Although the movie is six hours  long, it doesn't give you the same amount of character development as the  novel does. In truth, the the movie would have to be twice as long to do  this -- and would probably end up as less of a story. The producers did do  a fine job of allowing the audience to get to know the principles to some  extent. Enough is portrayed so that we aren't lost.
The story itself is  well told and does not drag. Six hours of viewing seems like three.
In  all, I'd say most people would enjoy this film rendition of ""The  Stand"". For all who see the movie, I'd also suggest they read the  book. Both are enjoyable, both are well done.

It is,  of course, extremely difficult to portray a character as evil as Flagg  brilliantly, but this portrayal is particularly poor.  Flagg never inspires  fear; in fact, the only emotion he ever inspires is disgust at the F/X  person who did his glowing eyes so badly.  The scariest part of this movie  is the superflu which kills almost all of humanity in the first reel.  All  the other characters besides Flagg are portrayed well by Gary Sinise, Laura  San Giacomo, Molly Ringwald, Rob Lowe and others.  Unfortunately, the story  does not focus on the myriad difficulties involved in living in a  post-plague world as the book does, but instead skips most of this  character development in the book and focuses instead on the battle between  good and evil.

It is the final catastrophy novel where the whole of humanity is destroyed by some  military research. This is secondary in the book or the video. What is  essential is the spectacle of the slow and precise decaying of our society  and the emergence of two possible futures.  One is positive and is inspired  by an old black woman. The other is negative and instilled in the minds of  some deranged men by the famous Dark Man, the famous Randall Flagg, the  famous etc.  On one side the good ones reinvent democracy and American  history. On the other side the bad ones reinvent a fascist society based on  torture and absolute tyranny.  What is interesting, first of all and above  all, in the book and the video is the concept of sacrifice. The good ones,  be they in the hands of God or of any other spiritual force, it does not  matter since if you don't believe in God, He believes in you, can only  impose their humane vision on the world, hence save humanity and not only  the human animal, by sending four of their foremost leaders to get  sacrificed (after three spies, which makes seven delegates) by the monster.  And it is in fact more witnesses than lambs that are sent. Two will be  sacrificed, one will be shot in prison, one will be shot on his way to Las  vegas, and one will kill herself not to speak. Only two will survive. One  because he broke his leg along the way and did not reach Las Vegas. The  other one because he managed to escape due to his retardness. The world  saved by this sacrifice and by the retarded individual that can escape any  scrutiny, even that of the devil.  Yet the video lacks something, it lacks  the virginal ending of the book, the return to some natural life, to a  natural couple with a child, to the Garden of Eden, and ends only on a  happy ending. Kind of a shame that King cut off that purely naive ending  that gave some new perspective to the story: we have to reinvent Eden if we  want humanity to survive, not only Boulder, that is to say a new Jerusalem,  some kind of ambiguous ending because of the echo it finds in some puritan  vision, at least of God and humanity as a whole.

The effects, the music, the actors...everything is top  rate...with the exception of the man who plays Randall Flag. Not a man I  would choose as evil...he's way too clownish for my taste. Gary Sinise is  remarkable. If you're a Sinise fan...sit through the 6 hours..you won't be  dissappointed. The beginning of the movie can't be discribed. It is the  most visual display of death you will ever see. Although this means the  movie is NOT meant for young children...stick to 15 yrs. and up. I enjoyed  this movie so much I ran out and bought the unedited version of the  book..($65.00)worth. Now that is something I never do...I'm not a big  reading fan.

ABC did a fantastic job of adapting the  characters of the novel to the small screen and the plot (while not exactly  following the Novel) was clever and interesting.  All the actors in the  movie did an excellent job.  This is a 6 hour long movie and it will hold  your interest from the beginning to the last scene.  Kudo's to ABC.,953078400,,511,4.185567010309279

582170,3,6303153461,"My favourite Stephen King novel by far is ""The Stand"". In the back of my mind I always suspected that someone would make a movie of it one day. It was something I both hoped and dreaded at the same  time.
Actually I was quite surpised at how this mini series turned out. I  can only describe it as hot and cold. The best part, like in the book, is  when the plague is killing everybody and the country is in chaos. At other  times (like in the book) the story lulls.
This adaptation is obviously  based on the cut version of King's book. I thought that was a bit of a  pity. It might have been interesting to see an actor's interpretation as  ""The Kid"". (One of my favorite parts in the book was when  Trashcan Man was travelling west with The Kid.)
When I first read the  novel in 1992 I imagined Corin Nemec as Nick Andros. Two years later I saw  him cast as Harold Lauder. I found that very weird. In general the story  seemed a bit toned down from the novel. After the plague it felt more like  a Western than a horror story.
It was a nice  touch to include Crowded  Houses' ""Don't Dream it's Over"" in the soundtrack. (A song by one  of my favourite groups.) Jamey Sheridan gave a good performance as the dark  man. He was an actor I had never seen before. After the dark man's defeat  the story slowed down again.
Fortunately this adaptation hasn't spoiled  the personal picture I have in my mind when reading the novel. But I don't  know if I'd read the novel if I'd seen the movie first.",951523200,2,1494,4.197183098591549

In This movie, a government ""super-flu"" wipes out most of the population of the  world, except for two small armies of people that will eventually engage in  the ultimate battle between good and evil!  (Which side will win?  This is  a question that has plaqued man-kind for centuries)!  There is a little bit  of EVERYTHING in this movie: drama, fear,suspense, love, friendship,  craziness, sex, and yes, even THE DEVIL HIMSELF, taking the form of an  obnoxious, wise-cracking cowboy!  Sure this movie is long, but never, NEVER  does it get boring!  The plot literally sucks you in,until you practically  feel yourself becoming part of the story!  I never grow tired of analyzing  all the character's different personalities.  In addition, this movie also  makes you think:  If Armeggedon really did happen like this, where would  you fit in?  Which side would you be on?  Definitely Steven King's BEST  work-to-date!

582174,5,6303153461,"As a very big fan of Steven King,I loved ""The Stand"". I taped the movie when it first was televised and have watched it numerous times since.  I had read the book for years.  Only King can do King and he did a  wonderful job.  The thing  I like most about it is the characters.  They  are corny and scared and every other emotion possible.  Gary Sinise, Rob  Lowe, Adam Stroke, Jamey Sheridan, and Ray Walston are stellar.  Its a  great story. I particularly enjoy the way the friendship grows between  these people and they eventually know what they must do and in the end, the  meek do save whats left.  There were certian things left out, such as  Kojaks adventure and dreams as he traveled alone to find his master, and  the omission of Frannie's diary.  I found Molly Ringwold a big  dissapoinment as Frannie.  I recomend this movie to anyone.

The shocking thing about The Stand is that this could  really happen. We also have something to learn from it. The chaos in the  movie, all the riots and the military, kill more people than the virus  itself if something like this happens. Why do people kill each other  instead of helping each other? That's a question I ask myself when I see  movies like this.
Nevertheless, this is a superb movie. Good actors (Gary  Sinise among others), scary plot and the terrifying stuff you see in it  make it one of the best horror-movies of all-time and I truly recommend it.",946771200,3,732,4.584615384615384

But that did not do serious harm to the movie.  I was very impressed with  the casting and the acting in this movie.  Also, I found the choice of  ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" by the Blue Oyster Cult and ""Don't  Dream It's Over"" by Crowded House to be very appropriate.

The scene with the reporters being stopped by the army was pathetic and Ed  Harris was completely wasted in the lamest possible sub-plot imaginable.

This is no one-star movie, this is one of the most innovative and  unusual treatments of Good and Evil I have seen.  (Even with the flaws.)  And then there are the stylish touches--the brilliant use of Blue Oyster  Cult and Crowded House, the smart and generally brief glimpses of carnage.  No, this is not King's best move--The Shawshank Redemption would take the  crown in my unimportant opinion.  But it's one of his better ones.  Maybe  no match for Stand By Me and Misery, but it sure beats Night Shift, The  Lawnmore Man, and what was that totally messed up movie about the cat  people?",944438400,3,1399,4.935344827586207
582241,5,6303153461,"""The Stand"" on DVD is an event -- six hours of programming on one CD-sized disc is awesome!  The clarity of the picture is astonishing, the sound is truly deep and sharp, and the music is piquant and  stimulating.  I'm a King fan, yes, but I'm not partial to bad movies of his  work.  This movie is SENSATIONAL.  The acting, directing, camerawork --  everything shines and it's a joy to have a clean, sharp, beautifully  recorded DVD of it.
My complaints are with the commentary -- one of the  special features.  If anyone has heard the various commentaries on  ""The Matrix""  (I think there are three), you probably know just  how intensely interesting and descriptive the various folks behind the  scene CAN be in a commentary.  On ""The Stand,"" you have King, the  director and a few of the actors -- not necessarily easily identified --  making random comments throughout the 6-hour film.  At first, you think  things are going to be fine, but you suddenly realize that this actor's  recollections don't jibe with the scene currently playing ... the various  people were apparently interviewed separately and then had their interviews  laid on to the commentary track ... randomly, it seems ... and often  repetitively.  I don't know how many times we need to hear Ruby Dee  describe her favorite scene in the film ... but, damn!  Although King  makes interesting observations, he clearly does not get that many of his  fans make more of his story -- and its meaning -- than he does.  King  thinks that ""The Stand"" is a metaphor for starting the world over  again without any reminder of previous technology.  Never mind, then, that  babies should not be born in hospitals, that water should not be  sterilized, that heating homes should not rely on electric power, that Stu  and Tom should never have had access to the Sno-Cat that returned them  safely to Boulder, etc., etc.  He is full of pronouncements but his story  clearly refutes his own personal stand against man's technological  achievements.  It would have been interesting to hear him discuss his ideas  more in depth, and there was time for him to do so, too.  There are LONG  stretches during the commentary play where all we hear is movie....and I'd  already seen the movie.
The movie is worth every cent of the selling  price of the DVD....but don't get your hopes up about the commentary.",944438400,16,2359,4.744416873449132

I was a little  dissapointed that the ""Making-of-Featurette"" is about 3 minutes  long, that the ""Special effects"" section is merely 4 conceptual  drawings of Randall Flagg's various guises. Also the ""Storyboard  Comparisons"" ammounts to about 5 or 6 shots with tiny roughly-drawn  storyboards in the top-left corner. All I'm saying is, be prepared to say  ""Hmmph, I thought there would be more"". But remember, you're  getting 6 HOURS OF COMMENTARY!",941760000,,719,4.933333333333334

Previous believable adaptations of King's books  are The Shawshank Redemption (of course), Misery, The Dark Half, The  Shining (Kubrick version, although I admit this one was not really true to  the book), 'Salem's Lot, and Stand By Me (based on the novella The Body).  The rest have just been undeniably horrible to the constant disgust of  Stephen King fans.  Thinner anyone?  So when The Stand came out in 1994 my  expectations were high but I was ready for a letdown.  That, thank God,  never came.  What came out in little pixels of color and constant blinking  lights was so engrossing and so well made that I forgot I was watching  television.  That's good stuff folks.  I kept saying throughout the  mini-series ""I remember that"" and ""Yep, straight outta the  book"".  Of course it is impossible to convey the same feeling one gets  from reading a book where one shapes the characters and gives them his/her  own face and voice but this was a pretty damn good substitute for primetime  television.

A well-rounded cast (including Brat Packers Ringwald and Lowe)--and a  King-worthy 6 hours to develop the multi-layered tale--make this a landmark  in the ever growing library of Stephen King films.  Unfortunately, after  Republic Pictures released the original 4-tape edition intended exclusively  for rental, this 2-tape edition was put on the market for sale to the  public.  How is this possible?  The video is duplicated in Extended Play  (EP) mode, the recording speed that allows you to put 6 hours of video on a  standard T120 VHS tape.  That's fine for recording a televised ball game  you'd otherwise miss, but for a movie that you intend to make a part of  your video collection, it's a crime.  The picture and sound quality is just  plain lousy.
