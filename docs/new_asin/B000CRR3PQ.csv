8101202,4,B000CRR3PQ,"This is a good movie, but once again it does not do the original story justice. The original story was about finding gold in a remote area of Idaho and this setting is Arizona,. The characters are almost completely different from the original as well as two brothers find gold in a remote area. The book ends with the mountain destroying the town. Why the original screenwriters felt they had to deviate from the original story so much is something I simply don't understand. Why bother to use the title if you are not going to use the story? Go figure.",1523664000,,553,4.485148514851486

8101204,4,B000CRR3PQ,"If you are looking for a proper Western of the old style, this movie is very good.  I expect the movie followed Zane Grey's novel fairly closely.

The transfer from the black-and-white film reels has a few flaws, but it is quite acceptable considering the movie was made in the mid-1930s.  The flaws serve to remind you of what it was like to watch movies way back when.  So get your popcorn and enjoy a night out at the old, no-more-to-be-found, movie theater.",1418169600,2,461,4.518072289156627

8101206,4,B000CRR3PQ,"I liked the video because it was about Thunder Mountain where my grandfather and his brothers discovered gold in Idaho, in the 1800's, the video did not really say any thing that related to the real story but there were some things that I liked.
