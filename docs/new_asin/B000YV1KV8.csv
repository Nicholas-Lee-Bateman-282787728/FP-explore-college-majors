3035301,5,B000YV1KV8,"This is a great workout-IF you don't mind struggling a little at first to learn the dance moves. This is more of a dance moves for cardio instead of just dance moves that may give you a workout. It is one of the most challenging FIRM workouts I have because of the intense cardio segments. I am a devoted FIRMIE and love the FIRM, and this workout is definitely one of the best in my opinion. It kicks your [...], but it is soooo fun that the time does go by quickly. The first 30 minutes or so are broken up into 3 9-10 minute cardio segments, then there is a lower intensity segment and finally, the cool down. No weights, just a lot of moving and shaking! Alison is a master at gradually building a segment move by move so you learn as you go and repeat the steps often so you don't feel overwhelmed. If you love to dance and want a great workout while shaking your booty slimmer, look no further!!",1204934400,33,901,4.183908045977011
3035306,5,B000YV1KV8,"I have always loved The Firm workouts.  This one is challenging, but good to work towards.  Broke a good sweat which is what matters.  Give it a try.",1408579200,,149,4.25
3035307,4,B000YV1KV8,"This workout probably isn't the most intense and could be more beneficial HOWEVER, it is still a pretty good workout and I always look forward to it. If nothing else, it at least gets you moving. If you put the work in, and don't just muddle through the dance moves, it's a very decent workout. There's 3 express options and then a full workout option. I will say I haven't been able to make it through the full one yet without having to take a little ""walk"" break! It's definitely a very fun DVD and I feel worth the money. It's easy to follow and the dance moves aren't half that bad!",1390780800,,586,4.241071428571429
3035308,3,B000YV1KV8,"Cardio Dance Fusion is a 45-minute, dance-inspired workout from The Firm.  I'll say at the outset that it is not one of my favorite Firm workouts, but I'll spend a fair amount of space discussing it, hopefully to help you decide whether it might be right for you.

For those of you already familiar with The Firm workouts, the instructor for this one is Alison.  For some reason, she's the lead instructor for most of The Firm workouts I own, so I'm quite used to her style.  Being familiar with Alison definitely helped me follow along.  I am certainly one of those people with ""two left feet"" mentioned on the back of the DVD case.  For the most part, I am able to follow along with this routine, though.  (Whenever anyone in a Firm workout says ""box step,"" I'm lost, however.  I simply cannot figure that out, no matter how many times I try.)  There is not a ton of repetition when you're learning the sequences.  For people unfamiliar with Alison and/or The Firm, this might be a challenge.  However, if you intend to use this DVD multiple times, you may be glad for the shorter instructional periods later on down the road.  If you know the moves, you don't want to be told for the 20th time how to do them.  In short: beginners may be a bit confused by the choreography.  In my opinion, however, it's (mostly) easy to pick up after doing the DVD a couple of times.

Another thing that might be frustrating or challenging for beginners is that there's not a separate warm-up.  You do some marching and stepping side-to-side, but before you know it, these two moves have morphed into the first routine.  This is another case where absolute beginners may feel a bit challenged.  (If you are a beginner, I'd suggest doing a bit of a warm-up on your own before popping in the DVD.  Walking in place or marching might work.)  However, people with a bit more experience can jump right in and follow along.

This DVD includes a lot of leg work; moves done with the legs are definitely more ""inspired"" than any of the upper body moves.  The first couple of segments have a small amount of jumping, but not a lot.  Later segments include some additional jumping, but in these sections, the blonde woman in the pink shirt does modified, lower-impact moves.  Overall, I found this DVD to be fairly easy on my joints (and I have bad knees).  I was disappointed that there weren't any options to INCREASE difficulty, however.

You keep moving pretty much the whole time in this one, and the pace is reasonably fast.  You might have to put the DVD on pause if you want to get water, though, because there aren't really breaks for that.  I would not call this a ""dance"" DVD so much as a cardio DVD with some dance-inspired moves.  (So ""Cardio Dance Fusion"" is an appropriate and descriptive title, for what it's worth.)  Alison is definitely a fitness instructor and not a dancer.

The participants all knew the choreography and all of them looked happy to be there.  I found the cues to be appropriate, and Alison did a good job of reminding you of what comes next.  All the participants seem fit.  Alison is able to talk the whole time, but you sometimes sense that she's *almost* out of breath.  You see a bit of sweat form on all the participants, but sometimes I wonder if they manipulate the temperature in the studio to make the participants sweat a bit more than they might, otherwise.

Two production-related things I did NOT care for:

(1) The music.  This had the same beat throughout, with some different notes thrown in, in the different segments.  The music in the first two segments, especially, sounded very similar.  It also sounded like it was on endless loop.

(2) The camera work.  The camera jumped around a lot.  I don't typically mind this in an exercise video, if there is a point to it.  However, here it seemed random -- and not always helpful.  Occasionally you'd see Alison's torso and head, when it would've been much more helpful to see her legs (or her whole body).

To be fair, I noticed the music and camera work much more when I was giving the DVD a thorough watching (while seated in front of the computer) prior to writing this review.  I noticed it much less when I was actually following along.

One major disappointment was that this DVD didn't include much in the way of resistance work (i.e., with weights).  That is one thing I always liked about other Firm DVDs -- the ability to combine cardio and strength training in one workout.  (I also note that the strength training components in other DVDs are built-in opportunities to increase the difficulty, for example, by increasing the amount of weight you lift.)  The last segment of Cardio Dance Fusion (before the cooldown) had some plis and lunges, but not really enough to get any strength-training benefit from them (in my opinion).  Because they're worked into a dance-style routine, you also really don't get to do them slowly enough and/or do them with great form.  (On the other hand, if you don't have any equipment, well, you don't need any to do this workout.)

A second major disappointment was that this workout wasn't all that difficult for me.  If you are new to exercise or if it has been several years since you last exercised, this DVD might be beneficial to you.  However, if you have been regularly exercising for some time (like I have), this DVD doesn't offer much of a challenge.  Once you master the moves, you sail through.  Sure, you'll break a light sweat.  But it's not sufficient -- especially in this shorter-than-usual Firm DVD -- to feel the burn, so to speak, if you're intermediate or advanced.

So there's the inherent contradiction: intensity-wise, this DVD is suited to beginners.  Choreography-wise, this DVD is suited to intermediate or advanced exercisers.  This makes it, unfortunately, not really ideal for either group.  I'd recommend this DVD for beginners who are confident in their abilities to follow along with choreography (and you should be able to pick most of it up after doing this workout a few times).  If you're more advanced, I'd suggest Alison's boot camp DVD or Kelsie's 500 calorie workout, instead (both also from The Firm).",1378166400,2,6169,4.643253234750462
3035309,5,B000YV1KV8,"I love this workout DVD.  It's fun, burns calories like crazy, I get sore in the right spots...where my problem areas are, and it's fun and challenging at the same time  I had worn out my previous DVD.

3035312,5,B000YV1KV8,I love Firm DVD's!!  They are all done with great quality and almost anyone can do them. I like how they approach all levels of fitness beginner - advanced and allow you to chose how hard you want to work.,1363219200,,205,4.125
3035313,5,B000YV1KV8,"This workout is so much fun! It's high cardio, great choreography. I've finally found that dancing for exercise is the most fun exercise I can do. It's a great stress reliever and makes me feel so good! Great job again, Firm!",1353888000,,225,4.512195121951219
3035314,5,B000YV1KV8,"This workout has a nice warmup and cooldown. The instructor breaks most of the steps down in a really simple way, so it's easy to follow along. When done right you can really feel your muscles working. It's especially beneficial to your legs and at points your abs. For more effective results in any exercise I always recommend tightening the muscle groups that you're focusing on and always your abs if it's a cardio workout.",1351728000,,426,4.693333333333333
3035315,5,B000YV1KV8,"I am a long-term FIRM user and have always appreciated their no-nonsense approach.  I don't buy workout videos to be entertained- I want to sweat!  That's why I am glad that I took a chance and got this workout.  The ""dance"" part really had me leery because I thought it wouldn't do much-  boy was I wrong!
Allison does a FANTASTIC job of explaining the steps and cueing the moves.  She gradually adds on to the routine until you can ""take it from the top"".  The three different types of dance keep it fresh and keep you moving!  There is absolutely NO dread factor from this workout-  I enjoy all of it.

One of the biggest pros for me is that most of it is low impact -but still very aerobic.  Even though I use this for my lighter days, I am still surprised at how much I sweat while doing this workout.

There is no equipment so it's also nice to just pop it in and get moving!
HIGHLY recommend this to all levels of fitness and coordination.  You'll love the workout and you'll enjoy Allison.",1345593600,,997,4.2727272727272725
3035316,4,B000YV1KV8,"No, this video is not taught in a beginner style, where it breaks down things very slowly, and adds on slowly.  However, as many have suggested, if you focus on learning one section at a time, one move at a time, you can get it.  I focused on one section, and even at times broke it down to doing just the legs, then just the arms, then putting the two together.  As you might have guessed, there was a lot of rewinding involved.  However, it wasn't long before I got all the sections down, and I find doing the whole routine is a lot of fun, gives me a good work out and is a nice alternative to the weight-based workouts more typical of The Firm.  Allison is very encouraging, with a fun attitude, and makes me want to do the routine that much better on each go round.

For those of you who are frustrated, consider giving it another try, while breaking it down a bit at a time.  You will get it, and when you do, this will become one of your favorites -- it is for me!",1344384000,2,971,4.078947368421052
3035317,5,B000YV1KV8,"This is for someone who already knows all of the basic dance step moves and doesn't need to be instructed at an elementary level again, something one wants when seeking a higher level of uninterrupted cardio. What you are learning is new choreography instead and that is easily picked up while having dancing fun. I was doing Tracy Anderson dance workouts but wanted something else for variety and with a litte less high impact. I loved this workout so much that I unfortunately bought Alison Davis's Cardio Dance Express as well and it turns out that they are identical DVDs with different names and picture on the front (!)-- so beware. These types of more advanced dance workouts are hard to find. No one needs to keep re-learning the samba or cha-cha when workout time is limited.  A DVD such at this level is perfect to get a good 30-45 minutes of non-stop cardio alone or before doing other toning exercises. So if anyone has any intermediate to advanced dance DVDs to recommend, it would be greatly appreciated. I also recommend Julianne Hough's Just Dance and Cardio Ballroom and Kendra Kemerley's NYC dance workout although Im not sure that one is available on Amazon yet.",1334448000,,1181,4.760975609756097
3035318,5,B000YV1KV8,"I ordered this DVD from Amazon (the only place I order my workout DVD's btw) after reading a lot of positive reviews. This was my first ""Firm"" DVD workout ever and I am so pleased that I order it!!! I have a lot of dance experience (and therefore usually do not like ""dance"" type workouts because they are not challenging enough) but Alison does a WONDERFUL job of mixing different types of dance and aerobic moves set to great music that held my attention from beginning to end. I watched the whole workout before trying it, and I suggest everyone do that too because Alison sometimes says ""left leg"" (during the Jive portion) when really she means ""right leg"". But once you learn the moves it doesn't really matter that her cuing is slightly off. In my opinion this is NOT a beginner workout but the great thing is there are ""express"" workouts to build up endurance, so really anyone can do the workout. I have now purchased a few other Firm workouts (Rebekah Sturkie is another favorite of mine now) and I'm LOVING how great I feel and how much I sweat doing the Firm workouts!! If you are looking for a good low impact aerobic/dance workout...BUY THIS DVD!",1322265600,,1160,4.5285714285714285
3035319,5,B000YV1KV8,"I ordered this video off amazon because it got such great reviews, and I am so glad that I did! While I am a huge lover of the firm, most of their videos are too hard on my knees. So, I end up only doing part of them and feeling like I didn't get a sufficient cardio workout. Not the case with this video, it is everything I have been looking for in a workout! It is hard, and leaves you weak once you're done, but it's also really fun. I danced for 18 years and still had to work to keep up and get the moves, so don't be discouraged!! GET THIS VIDEO if you are looking for a fun workout!",1315440000,,589,3.8360655737704916
3035320,4,B000YV1KV8,"This is a fun dance workout for the well coordinated. I'm a dancer and had no problem picking up the steps, but while I was doing the workout I was thinking about how it would be quite difficult for non dancers to pick up. Give it a go if you want a challenge. What I like about Alison is she'd constantly add on to moves, i.e. she'd teach one move, do it several times, add on the next move, do that several times, put the two together, do that several times, then move on and keep folding each new move back so that you naturally start to pick up the order of the combination. However, it is still fast paced, though in my mind just challenging enough to still be doable.

The workout is 45 minutes if you do the whole thing, and there are also 3 25 minute express options. The dvd express options say there's 3 workouts: club, latin and jive, and Alison also claims there's 3: latin, jive and modern. I put them together and claim there's 4: club, latin, jive and modern :-). The ""club"" section isn't very club like... at first I thought it was just a warmup, though it lasted past 10 minutes so that's why I'd classify it more as its own section. To me it had the feel of a choreographed aerobic routine or warmup. It's definitely dance based, like all the sections, but doesn't have any particular dance style. The latin section is fun and includes some mambo type moves and fast footwork. The jive section is my favorite and the choreography really suits the music well. The modern section seems shorter, is somewhat ballet inspired, but still upbeat, and goes right into the cool down stretches.

I found each section fun, fast paced and moderate intensity. If you want a workout you can follow along to without much thought, this probably isn't for you. But if you're good at picking up choreography and want to add a more dance inspired workout to your regular aerobic work, this is a good choice.",1300147200,2,1906,4.427350427350428
3035321,5,B000YV1KV8,"I have been dancing, pretty much my whole life and don't have two left feet by any stretch of the imagination, but this dvd is not for beginners or intermediate it is for the advanced. I have only used it once, I just got it today and am impressed that I will take some time to become an expert at it, so it will keep me challenged. I usually lose interest very quickly because I'm able to master the steps rather quickly that won't be the case here. Although, I like the dvd it did not do a good job of showing or breaking down the steps before heading straight into the routine. If you take some time to learn new dance routines, this dvd will leave you frustrated although even while only attempting to do the moves it gives you a very good workout.",1296604800,,752,4.1931034482758625
3035322,4,B000YV1KV8,"I was looking for a fun way to get a good cardio workout. I'm at a healthy weight recovering from a mid-pregnancy miscarriage but really don't have a history of working out...ever...And I've never danced a day in my life. Exercise is boring to me and if it's not fun or I don't feel like I can get through it I won't do it. Now onto my review...

After reading tons of 1 & 2 star reviews about how even good dancers couldn't get the moves down, I decided to try it anyway because of the low price. I put the DVD in and started the marching and the step touch thinking I was doing pretty good, then they go into the dance moves. It was literally impossible for me to understand what they were doing since they kept adding new moves to the fast-pace workout. I stopped and just stood there staring at the TV. My husband came in after my complaining about how impossible it was and he tried doing it, failing worse than I did. He said instead of trying to do the whole DVD getting every move wrong and getting a non-effective workout, I should do the first section over and over until I get it down, etc.

I decided to try it and he was right! I did the first section repeatedly until I got it down. It only took about 15 minutes until me and my 2 left feet could do it almost without watching them. AMAZING! Then the rest of the moves were easier to keep up with. So I recommend if you really really think you may have a hard time with COORDINATION, don't buy this unless you're up for a major challenge. Otherwise, I'd recommend it.

I like this DVD because I had to focus so much on the dance choreography to make sure I could keep up that I didn't notice I was sweaty and tired until I was finished. It was great having a challenge that kept me focused to get through the entire workout. My whole body felt worked out after (in a good way) and I felt good about myself for getting it down instead of giving up the first time I put it in the DVD player.

PROS:
-Great Cardio workout
-Good variety of dance moves
-Many different dance and time options
-The DVD gets right to the workout on the 25min express workout options without listening to any intro.
-The workouts go with the music

CONS:
-Not one of those workouts you can master the 1st time, or 2nd...
-It takes the ability to go from one move to another very quickly. You need good coordination and to be light of your feet. This may not be a con, but the back cover makes it sound much easier than it really is.",1295395200,2,2471,4.171907756813417
3035323,4,B000YV1KV8,I like this video. It is one heck of a workout. Definately for a more advanced person. It had lots of dance oriented moves.,1294963200,,123,4.166666666666667
3035324,3,B000YV1KV8,"I bought this video to do with my roommate, neither of us are dancers, and it took us a couple times before we could learn the dances.  Once we got the moves down, it was a fun workout, but it's not a high calorie burning, sweat inducing workout.  If you're looking for low to medium intensity, this is perfect.",1277942400,2,311,4.254237288135593
3035325,3,B000YV1KV8,"This is no doubt a decent workout, especially if you have had to take a LOOOOONG break from working out (in my case 5 years due to complicated pregnancy, labor, delivery, and then ankle injury).  I definitely worked up a sweat.  I had done extensive cardio dance in the past, lots of aerobics and step classes, and instructors and gym management used to try to convince me to get certified to teach.  So, even though I've had a long break, I'm certainly no stranger to aerobic dance type of workouts.  That being said, I had a difficult time following a lot of the moves.  The directions were inconsistent with sometimes being called ahead too far in advance and other times too late.  They also were not very descriptive of what was actually going to be occurring.  However, I could easily have gotten over that if the camera angles didn't keep switching.  They would show the move once, then switch to a head shot, or spin the camera around to from the instructor to others or show a shot from above.  They should have kept the camera angle consistent on the instructor until the move had been repeated several times on both sides of the body.  Also annoying was the repetitive music.  The same exact music for 5+ minutes before switching to the next style of the music, which still had the same underlying beat and was barely different at all from the previous track.

I will probably use this DVD again because it is a decent workout, but I will definitely be on the lookout ones with better instruction, camera angles, and music that isn't so repetitive.

Pro:  Decent Workout
Cons:  Inconsistent and poor instruction, repetitive music, too many changes with camera angles",1277510400,2,1677,4.675767918088737
3035326,4,B000YV1KV8,"Even when I was just starting out with this DVD and trying to learn the moves I was sweating.  It takes several times through to pick it up, but I found that learning each segment separately helped.  Now that I know the moves, this workout is a lot of fun.",1265328000,,256,4.1
3035327,5,B000YV1KV8,"This was a fun addition to my Firm DVD collection. I have about 7 Firm DVDs and 4 of them are taught by Alison Davis. I like her because she is not annoying and usually communicates the moves clearly. I'd say I'm at an intermediate/advanced level when it comes to at home DVD workouts. I use this one when I don't want to do weight training, as it is strictly dancing and cardio.

The DVD starts with a quick warm up segment, then moves to a salsa/mambo-like segment. After that is a high energy ""jive"" session, which includes moves such as the ""Charleston"" and the ""rock step"". It was pretty fun although definitely the hardest to follow. The last segment (my least favorite) is a ballet type segment, followed by a cool down.

This DVD is a nice change from the usual Firm workouts. It has good music and doesn't get boring at all. I have to admit, it takes several whirls with this video to learn the steps. I've probably done it about 30 times at this point and can do the steps without messing up but it took many tries. Also, there are a few instances where Alison miscues -for example, she says to kick the left leg yet she means the right leg, or she says to do four kicks when she actually only does 2. But after doing it several times I've picked up on these mistakes and now they don't bother me anymore.

All in all, I really enjoy this video and think it's a great one to use on the days that you want just a cardio workout without weights.",1263513600,2,1453,4.257246376811594
3035328,5,B000YV1KV8,"I am relatively new to the Firm, but so far this is my absolutely favorite video in the series. It did take me a few tries to get the moves down (they go by really fast the first few times), but now I can use the ""pump up the music"" feature (allowing the music to be louder than the instructions -- which is really nice after you learn it). While some of the moves are tricky, I personally find it so much FUN that even when I trip over my feet or am barely able to breathe (the third section involves lots of jumping), I can keep on going just because I enjoy it so much.

I also really like how you can do a full 45 minute workout or choose from 3 different 25 minute workouts for those days when you have less time or are just too tired to do the whole 45 minutes.

And the 10 workout results guarantee? Totally true. I've got a bit of tummy fat (understatement), but after 2 weeks of doing this, everything was noticeably less flabby. My clothes just fit so much better.",1254873600,,974,4.0942408376963355
3035329,5,B000YV1KV8,"I love this workout.  The 45 minute workout itself is divided into 3 dance sections: club, latin and jive.  You can play the entire 45 minute workout or in 25 minute express segments.  There is also an audio option which allows you to enjoy louder music.

The workout starts out with fast marching and Alison quickly moves into the first dance patterns.  I feel she gives a lot of clear cuing as well as ""taking it from the top"" - after a few attempts at this dvd, I was ""dancing"" through the entire workout.

The camera work is good in that you're not ever left wondering what the instructor and participants are doing with their arms or feet.

I'm not a dancer but managed to follow Alison's instruction quite well.  Once you learn the patterns, you can focus on moving with the music (i.e. dancing) and enjoy the workout.  I have done advanced workouts for 20 years and found that once I really learned the steps, I was sweating and making my heart rate goals for the full workout.

There are no weights used in this workout nor is there traditional ab work.  If you hold yourself properly, you'll work your core however.

I only hope that Alison Davis and Lisa Wheeler connect on another project - the choreography in this workout was so much fun.  And the music, particularly the more ambient stuff, was very well-suited for the movements.

I brought it back out and gave it another shot. The first 2 or 3 times I went through the video, I just used the express workouts to ease myself into the steps. After the third time though, I got most of it. Months later, I find myself pulling this dvd from my shelf over and over. It is a fun workout; I even catch myself smiling in the middle of it. Alison keeps me going, but not in a cheerleader way. I find that if I do it one day, I will want to do it the next day as well, instead of going back to my other boring workout dvd's that just seem like work and no fun.",1250121600,,718,3.76158940397351

The instructor is clear I suppose, but the moves are just kind of complicated, and you're expected to just pick them up as you work out. I really wish that there was some sort of ""learn the moves"" extra on the DVD that you could familiarize yourself with before even trying to do the actual workout. Learning on-the-go is frustrating, and when your out-of-shape-butt is just struggling to keep up, it's an added frustration to not feel like you're doing the moves correctly. Who wants to feel irritated/overwhelmed while they're working out?

I've tried this DVD twice and still can't get the moves down! It's so frustrating that it makes me want to quit (which I did) just so I could go outside and walk around the block instead.

Overall, if you love really perky cheerleader/drill-team-esque type dancing, then maybe this is for you. I myself love dancing, but not when I get this frustrated by silly moves! If you're patient enough to learn, and you do the moves correctly, I'm sure you'll get a great workout.",1246924800,,1264,4.559471365638767

Allison breezes through teaching you a new move, never slows down at all & the pace is like a race to finish ASAP throughout the workout. I'm the kind that needs to learn 1/2 time to get used to it, so I couldn't follow w/o messing up several times which is frustrating since I love dance workouts & have had no problem w/the majority of them.
The other point is that once you do learn each mini routine, she repeats them very often, which considering how fast she introduced the moves, you'd think she would have spent a little time.
The last point is that this may have some dancing elements, she's not a flexible or fluid dancer at all. She has a very controlled, angular way of doing the moves which when doing salsa didn't look right. She also moves so fast, her & the other dancers don't have enough time to do it w/o many times looking sloppy in execution. I didn't enjoy how she did many moves and it all mostly looked like aerobics.
Production value was of course professional, and many others may like this style or can learn fast, so I left 3 stars.

Sure, the steps may take a few times to get down, but that's what I like about it.  You feel good about yourself when you figure it out and have a great time doing it!  If you don't get them all in the beginning, just march in place until you can join back in.  The workout is about 50 minutes of constant movement and you really work up a sweat!  There is a 25 minute option as well.  Recently, I've been doing this video on Tuesday and Thursday, then doing some Firm sculpting videos on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  Along with a change in diet, I am definitely seeing results!  If you want a fun, challenging, effective, cardio workout, get this!",1244937600,,812,4.3533333333333335

My gripe is that the product description on the back and even on Amazon says there would be weight work - there isn't, which is fine with me, but then correct the description.

I adore Allison as an instructor and have over 50 FIRM workouts.  This one is my favorite.  The music is fun and it burns a heavy amount of calories.  You can even do it low impact when you aren't feeling your best.  Allison did a great job on choreograph and you will not be disapointed if you like dancing/aerobics.,1240790400,,440,4.37037037037037

The first time I did it I took a LONG time rewinding and redoing moves until I understood them. Personally, I thought they were a little tough to get but it was worth it. It has an interesting mix of moves, not what I expected. It isn't the most challenging, butt-kicking workout out there, it even seems too easy at first, but once you get the moves down and can focus on the workout it gets your heart rate up, keeps it up, and incorporates some satisfying & strengthening squat-like moves at the end. I do have to be in a particular mood for it, but it gets used for sure. It's worth it IF you take the time to get the moves down.

I was sweating a lot after the Jive portion.  Only complaint is that the cool down goes on forever.  It's not boring, but it just takes a long time.

I do admit that it was not the easiest choreography the first time through, but I did okay. Yeah, it can be a little frustrating when you don't always feel like you're on top of things, but on the bright side it gives you something to work for and to feel good about when you master more and more of it.  I thought about giving this four stars because of the times that I was confused, but once you get it, it really is a good workout; and isn't that why we buy videos - because we plan on doing them over and over?  So I say give Alison credit for a good workout - it's not a bad DVD just because you may not feel like an old pro the first time you do it.  My advice though - do this on a day when you're alert and ready for anything, because Alison will keep you on your toes!",1227139200,,877,3.88268156424581

I was shocked to see that the instructor immediately jumped right into complicated footwork! No warm-up (stretching like you should to prevent injury), no breaking down the steps or going slowly! Only for very advanced dancers. Much, much too fast. Also, she wears black pants and black shoes so it is very difficult to see the way her feet are moving. White shoes would have made it much easier. I give this product ZERO stars.",1225929600,3,514,4.4787234042553195

It had all these great dance moves, except the ""jive"" segment(horrible, lost my sweat), kept you moving but at the end of it I felt unfulfilled.  I realized this would just about only take the place of a 45 minute brisk walk.  Did I sweat? yes.  Was it kinda fun? yes.  Was it a good workout?not really.  After I did it I ended up doing my Complete Weight Training video with Jen Carmen for an hour to feel like I did something.  I should also mention that I just had my second child and at 250lbs this wasn't terribly difficult and I don't think is a good cardio staple.  It doesn't contain the ingredients for quicker weight loss.  Not a complete waste though, I think I will do it when I don't feel like really working out or when I can't go for a walk because of weather..although it may be a waste of time that could be better spent doing laundry..",1223424000,,957,4.2430939226519335

I am the kind of person that is horribly uncoordinated, but I figured that if I watched the DVD first, I could do it.  The night I got it, I watched it through, and tried it the next day.  I was stumbling around a lot, but it wasn't horrible.  After I had done the workout several times, I had it down to a science.  If you are patient and really are willing to learn the steps, you will.  It also helps to try each express segment on its own to focus on the steps.

That being said, the workout is pretty challenging.  It gets me sweating and gets my heart-rate up, unless I am completely slacking off.  I admit that sometimes it can get a little boring and repetitive, but I really do feel great afterwards.  The stretching at the end feels awesome!  Overall, this workout can be pretty fun and effective, as long as you are patient enough to learn the steps and have other workouts to rotate with it.",1221004800,,1167,4.226244343891403

After exercising for the second time, I had no problem to follow and already knew the only wrong cut in the latin dance workout.
It is a  good workout, if you don't want to do a hard one and want some fun. Nevertheless, you're sweating at the end of the full-length workout (even if you're in good shape and exercising 3-5 times per week).

I have tried a few dance workouts in the past, but have found the moves overly complicated and the workout not that great.  This dvd, on the other hand, is a blast.  The moves are fairly easy, especially if you have done other firm aerobic tapes in the past.  After working out with the dvd, I feel that I've gotten a great workout!

The tape breaks down as:
10 minute warm-up -- this is the hip-hop section
10 minute low impact -- this is the latin section, which is also a great workout for the abs
10 minute high-impact -- this is the swing/jive section, which is a great cardio workout
10 minute cool-down --  this is a ballet inspired section that gives you a great leg workout.
5 minute stretch -- this combines stretching with some balancing moves

There is also the option of 3 - 25 minute express workouts.  These combine one of the first three workouts (hip-hop, latin, or jive) with the ballet workout and stretch.  I really enjoy this workout and highly recommend it.",1219881600,4,1053,4.442708333333333

I pick up on things very quickly.  I bought this one from The Firm, first of all because I really like another video from them - Ultimate Fat Burning Solution.  That video is AWESOME and really kicks my butt at the workout.  Allison also teaches that one and she does a great job breaking down the steps before going full tilt.  NOT on this video though.  Poor, poor job of giving you cues and she doesn't slow down ANY of the steps in here.  I had a tough time with a lot of steps and it was very frustrating.  Like I stated before, I usually never have a problem, but did with this.  It was still an effective workout, but like another poster, I substituted some of the steps because I couldn't get down the move.  I'm sure I'll finally figure it out after doing it a few times, but this is the first time I've encountered this since I've been working out.  Disappointing considering The Firm and Allison.

Alison is by far my favorite instructor from the Firm because she's inspiring, keeps you motivated, and makes you want to work harder.  I can't say enough about this workout.

3035408,4,B000YV1KV8,"I LOVE this workout. I am old Firm Believer and some of the newer releases have been very disappointing. Cardio Dance Fusion is very fast paced, excellently cued, and just a plain fun workout. Alison does a great job of getting you through the steps at tempo so after a playing or two, you have most of the moves down. I'm not a dancer nor am I terribly graceful, however by the third playing, I had the steps all down pretty well. At least well enough to really enjoy the dances. I have RA so I was concerned about my joints but no worries with this workout. Just plently of fun, sweat and calorie burning. I actually want to work out with this one! Don't let the express workout option fool you. They may be shorter, but you'll still have the heart rate way up there! If you're looking for an excuse to do cardio more often, this is it :-)",1207353600,,841,4.229813664596273
3035409,5,B000YV1KV8,"I'll admit that I was frustrated the first time I tried to do this workout but did work up a sweat while trying to keep up. The next day I was determined to learn this, so I just did each section over and over until I got it down, while taking breaks in between. I ended up having so much fun that I did the workout again later in the day. I now use this as a warm up almost every day doing only the fist two sections, which are club dance and salsa dance, and then move on to another firm workout. I love the music and admit this is one of my new favorite firms for the fun factor of it.",1207008000,,588,3.7886178861788617

WELL, I don't have two left feet and have been successful with dance videos on my cardio days but not this one.  The moves are too complex and not called effectively enough to enable you to maintain a cardiovascular workout and follow along.  I found myself subtituting jumping jacks and jump rope moves to maintain my heart rate when the choreography got too difficult.  I still recommend The Firm Cardio Dance Slimdown for an easier to follow more effective workout.  Don't always believe what you read on the back of those DVD sleeves.",1207008000,15,645,4.631578947368421
3035411,4,B000YV1KV8,"I'm not terribly coordinated, so I usually stay away from alot of dancy stuff.  I end up spending half the time at a low heart rate as I struggle through the moves.  And while I didn't hit every step perfectly the first time on this one, I was able to keep up and get in a good workout.  The girls really look like they're having fun, too.  I like the fact that this doesn't require any equipment, so I can take it on the road with me.  Sometimes I wish the camera had more full-body shots so I could see Alison's feet, but I'll figure it out.  This is FAR better than the Firm's ""Cardio Dance Slimdown"", although I love the instructor, Allie.  Castmember Emily is sporting a cute new 'do and a rockin' bod-- very inspirational for us moms!

3269798,5,B000YV1KV8,"This is a great workout-IF you don't mind struggling a little at first to learn the dance moves. This is more of a dance moves for cardio instead of just dance moves that may give you a workout. It is one of the most challenging FIRM workouts I have because of the intense cardio segments. I am a devoted FIRMIE and love the FIRM, and this workout is definitely one of the best in my opinion. It kicks your [...], but it is soooo fun that the time does go by quickly. The first 30 minutes or so are broken up into 3 9-10 minute cardio segments, then there is a lower intensity segment and finally, the cool down. No weights, just a lot of moving and shaking! Alison is a master at gradually building a segment move by move so you learn as you go and repeat the steps often so you don't feel overwhelmed.

If nothing else, it at least gets you moving. If you put the work in, and don't just muddle through the dance moves, it's a very decent workout. There's 3 express options and then a full workout option. I will say I haven't been able to make it through the full one yet without having to take a little ""walk"" break! It's definitely a very fun DVD and I feel worth the money. It's easy to follow and the dance moves aren't half that bad!",1390780800,,586,4.241071428571429
3269805,3,B000YV1KV8,"Cardio Dance Fusion is a 45-minute, dance-inspired workout from The Firm.  I'll say at the outset that it is not one of my favorite Firm workouts, but I'll spend a fair amount of space discussing it, hopefully to help you decide whether it might be right for you.

For those of you already familiar with The Firm workouts, the instructor for this one is Alison.  For some reason, she's the lead instructor for most of The Firm workouts I own, so I'm quite used to her style.  Being familiar with Alison definitely helped me follow along.  I am certainly one of those people with ""two left feet"" mentioned on the back of the DVD case.  For the most part, I am able to follow along with this routine, though.  (Whenever anyone in a Firm workout says ""box step,"" I'm lost, however.  I simply cannot figure that out, no matter how many times I try.)  There is not a ton of repetition when you're learning the sequences.  For people unfamiliar with Alison and/or The Firm, this might be a challenge.  However, if you intend to use this DVD multiple times, you may be glad for the shorter instructional periods later on down the road.  If you know the moves, you don't want to be told for the 20th time how to do them.  In short: beginners may be a bit confused by the choreography.  In my opinion, however, it's (mostly) easy to pick up after doing the DVD a couple of times.

Another thing that might be frustrating or challenging for beginners is that there's not a separate warm-up.  You do some marching and stepping side-to-side, but before you know it, these two moves have morphed into the first routine.  This is another case where absolute beginners may feel a bit challenged.  (If you are a beginner, I'd suggest doing a bit of a warm-up on your own before popping in the DVD.  Walking in place or marching might work.)  However, people with a bit more experience can jump right in and follow along.

This DVD includes a lot of leg work; moves done with the legs are definitely more ""inspired"" than any of the upper body moves.  The first couple of segments have a small amount of jumping, but not a lot.  Later segments include some additional jumping, but in these sections, the blonde woman in the pink shirt does modified, lower-impact moves.  Overall, I found this DVD to be fairly easy on my joints (and I have bad knees).  I was disappointed that there weren't any options to INCREASE difficulty, however.

You keep moving pretty much the whole time in this one, and the pace is reasonably fast.  You might have to put the DVD on pause if you want to get water, though, because there aren't really breaks for that.  I would not call this a ""dance"" DVD so much as a cardio DVD with some dance-inspired moves.  (So ""Cardio Dance Fusion"" is an appropriate and descriptive title, for what it's worth.)  Alison is definitely a fitness instructor and not a dancer.

The participants all knew the choreography and all of them looked happy to be there.  I found the cues to be appropriate, and Alison did a good job of reminding you of what comes next.  All the participants seem fit.  Alison is able to talk the whole time, but you sometimes sense that she's *almost* out of breath.  You see a bit of sweat form on all the participants, but sometimes I wonder if they manipulate the temperature in the studio to make the participants sweat a bit more than they might, otherwise.

Two production-related things I did NOT care for:

(1) The music.  This had the same beat throughout, with some different notes thrown in, in the different segments.  The music in the first two segments, especially, sounded very similar.  It also sounded like it was on endless loop.

(2) The camera work.  The camera jumped around a lot.  I don't typically mind this in an exercise video, if there is a point to it.  However, here it seemed random -- and not always helpful.  Occasionally you'd see Alison's torso and head, when it would've been much more helpful to see her legs (or her whole body).

To be fair, I noticed the music and camera work much more when I was giving the DVD a thorough watching (while seated in front of the computer) prior to writing this review.  I noticed it much less when I was actually following along.

One major disappointment was that this DVD didn't include much in the way of resistance work (i.e., with weights).  That is one thing I always liked about other Firm DVDs -- the ability to combine cardio and strength training in one workout.  (I also note that the strength training components in other DVDs are built-in opportunities to increase the difficulty, for example, by increasing the amount of weight you lift.)  The last segment of Cardio Dance Fusion (before the cooldown) had some plis and lunges, but not really enough to get any strength-training benefit from them (in my opinion).  Because they're worked into a dance-style routine, you also really don't get to do them slowly enough and/or do them with great form.  (On the other hand, if you don't have any equipment, well, you don't need any to do this workout.)

A second major disappointment was that this workout wasn't all that difficult for me.  If you are new to exercise or if it has been several years since you last exercised, this DVD might be beneficial to you.  However, if you have been regularly exercising for some time (like I have), this DVD doesn't offer much of a challenge.  Once you master the moves, you sail through.  Sure, you'll break a light sweat.  But it's not sufficient -- especially in this shorter-than-usual Firm DVD -- to feel the burn, so to speak, if you're intermediate or advanced.

So there's the inherent contradiction: intensity-wise, this DVD is suited to beginners.  Choreography-wise, this DVD is suited to intermediate or advanced exercisers.  This makes it, unfortunately, not really ideal for either group.  I'd recommend this DVD for beginners who are confident in their abilities to follow along with choreography (and you should be able to pick most of it up after doing this workout a few times).  If you're more advanced, I'd suggest Alison's boot camp DVD or Kelsie's 500 calorie workout, instead (both also from The Firm).",1378166400,2,6169,4.643253234750462

3269811,5,B000YV1KV8,"This workout has a nice warmup and cooldown. The instructor breaks most of the steps down in a really simple way, so it's easy to follow along. When done right you can really feel your muscles working. It's especially beneficial to your legs and at points your abs. For more effective results in any exercise I always recommend tightening the muscle groups that you're focusing on and always your abs if it's a cardio workout.",1351728000,,426,4.693333333333333

That's why I am glad that I took a chance and got this workout.  The ""dance"" part really had me leery because I thought it wouldn't do much-  boy was I wrong!
Allison does a FANTASTIC job of explaining the steps and cueing the moves.  She gradually adds on to the routine until you can ""take it from the top"".  The three different types of dance keep it fresh and keep you moving!  There is absolutely NO dread factor from this workout-  I enjoy all of it.

One of the biggest pros for me is that most of it is low impact -but still very aerobic.  Even though I use this for my lighter days, I am still surprised at how much I sweat while doing this workout.

There is no equipment so it's also nice to just pop it in and get moving!
HIGHLY recommend this to all levels of fitness and coordination.  You'll love the workout and you'll enjoy Allison.",1345593600,,997,4.2727272727272725
3269813,4,B000YV1KV8,"No, this video is not taught in a beginner style, where it breaks down things very slowly, and adds on slowly.  However, as many have suggested, if you focus on learning one section at a time, one move at a time, you can get it.  I focused on one section, and even at times broke it down to doing just the legs, then just the arms, then putting the two together.  As you might have guessed, there was a lot of rewinding involved.  However, it wasn't long before I got all the sections down, and I find doing the whole routine is a lot of fun, gives me a good work out and is a nice alternative to the weight-based workouts more typical of The Firm.  Allison is very encouraging, with a fun attitude, and makes me want to do the routine that much better on each go round.

For those of you who are frustrated, consider giving it another try, while breaking it down a bit at a time.  You will get it, and when you do, this will become one of your favorites -- it is for me!",1344384000,2,971,4.078947368421052
3269814,5,B000YV1KV8,"This is for someone who already knows all of the basic dance step moves and doesn't need to be instructed at an elementary level again, something one wants when seeking a higher level of uninterrupted cardio. What you are learning is new choreography instead and that is easily picked up while having dancing fun. I was doing Tracy Anderson dance workouts but wanted something else for variety and with a litte less high impact. I loved this workout so much that I unfortunately bought Alison Davis's Cardio Dance Express as well and it turns out that they are identical DVDs with different names and picture on the front (!)-- so beware. These types of more advanced dance workouts are hard to find. No one needs to keep re-learning the samba or cha-cha when workout time is limited.  A DVD such at this level is perfect to get a good 30-45 minutes of non-stop cardio alone or before doing other toning exercises. So if anyone has any intermediate to advanced dance DVDs to recommend, it would be greatly appreciated. I also recommend Julianne Hough's Just Dance and Cardio Ballroom and Kendra Kemerley's NYC dance workout although Im not sure that one is available on Amazon yet.",1334448000,,1181,4.760975609756097

This was my first ""Firm"" DVD workout ever and I am so pleased that I order it!!! I have a lot of dance experience (and therefore usually do not like ""dance"" type workouts because they are not challenging enough) but Alison does a WONDERFUL job of mixing different types of dance and aerobic moves set to great music that held my attention from beginning to end. I watched the whole workout before trying it, and I suggest everyone do that too because Alison sometimes says ""left leg"" (during the Jive portion) when really she means ""right leg"". But once you learn the moves it doesn't really matter that her cuing is slightly off. In my opinion this is NOT a beginner workout but the great thing is there are ""express"" workouts to build up endurance, so really anyone can do the workout. I have now purchased a few other Firm workouts (Rebekah Sturkie is another favorite of mine now) and I'm LOVING how great I feel and how much I sweat doing the Firm workouts!! If you are looking for a good low impact aerobic/dance workout...BUY THIS DVD!",1322265600,,1160,4.5285714285714285

Not the case with this video, it is everything I have been looking for in a workout! It is hard, and leaves you weak once you're done, but it's also really fun. I danced for 18 years and still had to work to keep up and get the moves, so don't be discouraged!! GET THIS VIDEO if you are looking for a fun workout!",1315440000,,589,3.8360655737704916
3269817,4,B000YV1KV8,"This is a fun dance workout for the well coordinated. I'm a dancer and had no problem picking up the steps, but while I was doing the workout I was thinking about how it would be quite difficult for non dancers to pick up. Give it a go if you want a challenge. What I like about Alison is she'd constantly add on to moves, i.e. she'd teach one move, do it several times, add on the next move, do that several times, put the two together, do that several times, then move on and keep folding each new move back so that you naturally start to pick up the order of the combination. However, it is still fast paced, though in my mind just challenging enough to still be doable.

The workout is 45 minutes if you do the whole thing, and there are also 3 25 minute express options. The dvd express options say there's 3 workouts: club, latin and jive, and Alison also claims there's 3: latin, jive and modern. I put them together and claim there's 4: club, latin, jive and modern :-). The ""club"" section isn't very club like... at first I thought it was just a warmup, though it lasted past 10 minutes so that's why I'd classify it more as its own section. To me it had the feel of a choreographed aerobic routine or warmup. It's definitely dance based, like all the sections, but doesn't have any particular dance style. The latin section is fun and includes some mambo type moves and fast footwork. The jive section is my favorite and the choreography really suits the music well. The modern section seems shorter, is somewhat ballet inspired, but still upbeat, and goes right into the cool down stretches.

I found each section fun, fast paced and moderate intensity. If you want a workout you can follow along to without much thought, this probably isn't for you. But if you're good at picking up choreography and want to add a more dance inspired workout to your regular aerobic work, this is a good choice.",1300147200,2,1906,4.427350427350428

I have only used it once, I just got it today and am impressed that I will take some time to become an expert at it, so it will keep me challenged. I usually lose interest very quickly because I'm able to master the steps rather quickly that won't be the case here. Although, I like the dvd it did not do a good job of showing or breaking down the steps before heading straight into the routine. If you take some time to learn new dance routines, this dvd will leave you frustrated although even while only attempting to do the moves it gives you a very good workout.",1296604800,,752,4.1931034482758625
3269819,4,B000YV1KV8,"I was looking for a fun way to get a good cardio workout. I'm at a healthy weight recovering from a mid-pregnancy miscarriage but really don't have a history of working out...ever...And I've never danced a day in my life. Exercise is boring to me and if it's not fun or I don't feel like I can get through it I won't do it. Now onto my review...

After reading tons of 1 & 2 star reviews about how even good dancers couldn't get the moves down, I decided to try it anyway because of the low price. I put the DVD in and started the marching and the step touch thinking I was doing pretty good, then they go into the dance moves. It was literally impossible for me to understand what they were doing since they kept adding new moves to the fast-pace workout. I stopped and just stood there staring at the TV. My husband came in after my complaining about how impossible it was and he tried doing it, failing worse than I did. He said instead of trying to do the whole DVD getting every move wrong and getting a non-effective workout, I should do the first section over and over until I get it down, etc.

I decided to try it and he was right! I did the first section repeatedly until I got it down. It only took about 15 minutes until me and my 2 left feet could do it almost without watching them. AMAZING! Then the rest of the moves were easier to keep up with. So I recommend if you really really think you may have a hard time with COORDINATION, don't buy this unless you're up for a major challenge. Otherwise, I'd recommend it.

I like this DVD because I had to focus so much on the dance choreography to make sure I could keep up that I didn't notice I was sweaty and tired until I was finished. It was great having a challenge that kept me focused to get through the entire workout. My whole body felt worked out after (in a good way) and I felt good about myself for getting it down instead of giving up the first time I put it in the DVD player.

PROS:
-Great Cardio workout
-Good variety of dance moves
-Many different dance and time options
-The DVD gets right to the workout on the 25min express workout options without listening to any intro.
-The workouts go with the music

CONS:
-Not one of those workouts you can master the 1st time, or 2nd...
-It takes the ability to go from one move to another very quickly. You need good coordination and to be light of your feet. This may not be a con, but the back cover makes it sound much easier than it really is.",1295395200,2,2471,4.171907756813417

3269821,3,B000YV1KV8,"I bought this video to do with my roommate, neither of us are dancers, and it took us a couple times before we could learn the dances.  Once we got the moves down, it was a fun workout, but it's not a high calorie burning, sweat inducing workout.  If you're looking for low to medium intensity, this is perfect.",1277942400,2,311,4.254237288135593
3269822,3,B000YV1KV8,"This is no doubt a decent workout, especially if you have had to take a LOOOOONG break from working out (in my case 5 years due to complicated pregnancy, labor, delivery, and then ankle injury).  I definitely worked up a sweat.  I had done extensive cardio dance in the past, lots of aerobics and step classes, and instructors and gym management used to try to convince me to get certified to teach.  So, even though I've had a long break, I'm certainly no stranger to aerobic dance type of workouts.  That being said, I had a difficult time following a lot of the moves.  The directions were inconsistent with sometimes being called ahead too far in advance and other times too late.  They also were not very descriptive of what was actually going to be occurring.  However, I could easily have gotten over that if the camera angles didn't keep switching.  They would show the move once, then switch to a head shot, or spin the camera around to from the instructor to others or show a shot from above.  They should have kept the camera angle consistent on the instructor until the move had been repeated several times on both sides of the body.  Also annoying was the repetitive music.  The same exact music for 5+ minutes before switching to the next style of the music, which still had the same underlying beat and was barely different at all from the previous track.

I will probably use this DVD again because it is a decent workout, but I will definitely be on the lookout ones with better instruction, camera angles, and music that isn't so repetitive.

Pro:  Decent Workout
Cons:  Inconsistent and poor instruction, repetitive music, too many changes with camera angles",1277510400,2,1677,4.675767918088737
3269823,4,B000YV1KV8,"Even when I was just starting out with this DVD and trying to learn the moves I was sweating.  It takes several times through to pick it up, but I found that learning each segment separately helped.  Now that I know the moves, this workout is a lot of fun.",1265328000,,256,4.1
3269824,5,B000YV1KV8,"This was a fun addition to my Firm DVD collection. I have about 7 Firm DVDs and 4 of them are taught by Alison Davis. I like her because she is not annoying and usually communicates the moves clearly. I'd say I'm at an intermediate/advanced level when it comes to at home DVD workouts. I use this one when I don't want to do weight training, as it is strictly dancing and cardio.

The DVD starts with a quick warm up segment, then moves to a salsa/mambo-like segment. After that is a high energy ""jive"" session, which includes moves such as the ""Charleston"" and the ""rock step"". It was pretty fun although definitely the hardest to follow. The last segment (my least favorite) is a ballet type segment, followed by a cool down.

This DVD is a nice change from the usual Firm workouts. It has good music and doesn't get boring at all. I have to admit, it takes several whirls with this video to learn the steps. I've probably done it about 30 times at this point and can do the steps without messing up but it took many tries. Also, there are a few instances where Alison miscues -for example, she says to kick the left leg yet she means the right leg, or she says to do four kicks when she actually only does 2. But after doing it several times I've picked up on these mistakes and now they don't bother me anymore.

All in all, I really enjoy this video and think it's a great one to use on the days that you want just a cardio workout without weights.",1263513600,2,1453,4.257246376811594
3269825,5,B000YV1KV8,"I am relatively new to the Firm, but so far this is my absolutely favorite video in the series. It did take me a few tries to get the moves down (they go by really fast the first few times), but now I can use the ""pump up the music"" feature (allowing the music to be louder than the instructions -- which is really nice after you learn it). While some of the moves are tricky, I personally find it so much FUN that even when I trip over my feet or am barely able to breathe (the third section involves lots of jumping), I can keep on going just because I enjoy it so much.

I also really like how you can do a full 45 minute workout or choose from 3 different 25 minute workouts for those days when you have less time or are just too tired to do the whole 45 minutes.

And the 10 workout results guarantee? Totally true. I've got a bit of tummy fat (understatement), but after 2 weeks of doing this, everything was noticeably less flabby. My clothes just fit so much better.",1254873600,,974,4.0942408376963355
3269826,5,B000YV1KV8,"I love this workout.  The 45 minute workout itself is divided into 3 dance sections: club, latin and jive.  You can play the entire 45 minute workout or in 25 minute express segments.  There is also an audio option which allows you to enjoy louder music.

The workout starts out with fast marching and Alison quickly moves into the first dance patterns.  I feel she gives a lot of clear cuing as well as ""taking it from the top"" - after a few attempts at this dvd, I was ""dancing"" through the entire workout.

The camera work is good in that you're not ever left wondering what the instructor and participants are doing with their arms or feet.

I'm not a dancer but managed to follow Alison's instruction quite well.  Once you learn the patterns, you can focus on moving with the music (i.e. dancing) and enjoy the workout.  I have done advanced workouts for 20 years and found that once I really learned the steps, I was sweating and making my heart rate goals for the full workout.

There are no weights used in this workout nor is there traditional ab work.  If you hold yourself properly, you'll work your core however.

I only hope that Alison Davis and Lisa Wheeler connect on another project - the choreography in this workout was so much fun.  And the music, particularly the more ambient stuff, was very well-suited for the movements.

Well done Firm!",1253059200,,1361,4.5473251028806585
3269827,5,B000YV1KV8,"I've owned this video for about one year. At first, I was intimidated by the dance steps since I am not a dancer and put it away for a few months. I brought it back out and gave it another shot. The first 2 or 3 times I went through the video, I just used the express workouts to ease myself into the steps. After the third time though, I got most of it. Months later, I find myself pulling this dvd from my shelf over and over. It is a fun workout; I even catch myself smiling in the middle of it. Alison keeps me going, but not in a cheerleader way. I find that if I do it one day, I will want to do it the next day as well, instead of going back to my other boring workout dvd's that just seem like work and no fun.",1250121600,,718,3.76158940397351
3269828,3,B000YV1KV8,"As I'm typing this, I'm still sweaty from doing this workout. The intensity is basically its only pro in my book. And no, I didn't make it all the way through the 45 min workout because A: I am out of shape and B: because I just got too frustrated!

The instructor is clear I suppose, but the moves are just kind of complicated, and you're expected to just pick them up as you work out. I really wish that there was some sort of ""learn the moves"" extra on the DVD that you could familiarize yourself with before even trying to do the actual workout. Learning on-the-go is frustrating, and when your out-of-shape-butt is just struggling to keep up, it's an added frustration to not feel like you're doing the moves correctly. Who wants to feel irritated/overwhelmed while they're working out?

I've tried this DVD twice and still can't get the moves down! It's so frustrating that it makes me want to quit (which I did) just so I could go outside and walk around the block instead.

Overall, if you love really perky cheerleader/drill-team-esque type dancing, then maybe this is for you. I myself love dancing, but not when I get this frustrated by silly moves! If you're patient enough to learn, and you do the moves correctly, I'm sure you'll get a great workout.",1246924800,,1264,4.559471365638767
3269829,3,B000YV1KV8,"This is best for those who can learn quick. Allison breezes through teaching you a new move, never slows down at all & the pace is like a race to finish ASAP throughout the workout. I'm the kind that needs to learn 1/2 time to get used to it, so I couldn't follow w/o messing up several times which is frustrating since I love dance workouts & have had no problem w/the majority of them.
The other point is that once you do learn each mini routine, she repeats them very often, which considering how fast she introduced the moves, you'd think she would have spent a little time.
The last point is that this may have some dancing elements, she's not a flexible or fluid dancer at all. She has a very controlled, angular way of doing the moves which when doing salsa didn't look right. She also moves so fast, her & the other dancers don't have enough time to do it w/o many times looking sloppy in execution. I didn't enjoy how she did many moves and it all mostly looked like aerobics.
Production value was of course professional, and many others may like this style or can learn fast, so I left 3 stars.

Yeah, it can be a little frustrating when you don't always feel like you're on top of things, but on the bright side it gives you something to work for and to feel good about when you master more and more of it.  I thought about giving this four stars because of the times that I was confused, but once you get it, it really is a good workout; and isn't that why we buy videos - because we plan on doing them over and over?  So I say give Alison credit for a good workout - it's not a bad DVD just because you may not feel like an old pro the first time you do it.

I realized this would just about only take the place of a 45 minute brisk walk.  Did I sweat? yes.  Was it kinda fun? yes.  Was it a good workout?not really.

I was stumbling around a lot, but it wasn't horrible.  After I had done the workout several times, I had it down to a science.  If you are patient and really are willing to learn the steps, you will.  It also helps to try each express segment on its own to focus on the steps.

That being said, the workout is pretty challenging.  It gets me sweating and gets my heart-rate up, unless I am completely slacking off.

10 minute warm-up -- this is the hip-hop section
10 minute low impact -- this is the latin section, which is also a great workout for the abs
10 minute high-impact -- this is the swing/jive section, which is a great cardio workout
10 minute cool-down --  this is a ballet inspired section that gives you a great leg workout.
5 minute stretch -- this combines stretching with some balancing moves

3269896,4,B000YV1KV8,"One of my favorite things about this video is that I can choose to do the entire thing, which has all dance segments, or I can choose the Express workouts which are only 25 minutes each.

The only drawback is this...I love pretty much every single one of the dance segments, however, I would say that the ballet portion is my least favorite, and that one is used as secondary dance in all of the express segments. I get, though, that it's got stretching and cool down type movements in it, so I'm sure that's why they chose it...it's just not as fun.

All in all, the other dance segments are some of my favorite from any of the videos I have.",1210550400,,643,4.262295081967213
3269897,5,B000YV1KV8,"I just did my first workout with this dvd and I LOVED it! Alison is a favorite instructor of mine, I have two of her other dvds and they are the best as far as the Firm goes in my opinion. The music was even pretty good (which is a stretch for me to admit). I worked up a sweat trying to keep up with the dance moves, I'm sure I'll get them down after doing this one a few more times.  Nonetheless, a great, fun workout!",1210464000,,420,3.8275862068965516
3269898,5,B000YV1KV8,I am not a dancer but really like this DVD.  I have not even learned all the moves yet but really work up a sweat just trying to keep up.  I have been doing FIRM tapes for 20 years and this one is fun.,1209168000,,201,3.5454545454545454
3269899,5,B000YV1KV8,"This is the first DVD in a long time I have loved from workout #1.  It was a little tricky at first, but I learned the footwork before adding the arms and had it all mostly down by the last rep.  Alison spends lots of time on each set, instead of going from move to move like crazy.  You really have enough time to get this down!

To anyone who does try it, please don't give up after your first try.  Many of the best workout DVDs take a couple of rounds to get down.",1209081600,8,468,3.8842105263157896
3269900,5,B000YV1KV8,"This video is really the most fun workout ever.  I absoulutely love it.  It is not easy at first to get all the moves, but the fun is in learning and mastering the moves.  It does take a couple of workouts to feel proficient in the moves, but even until then, you are getting a great cardio workout.  Totally buy this and don't listen to the naysayers who just gave up too quickly!!",1208908800,5,382,4.191780821917808
3269901,5,B000YV1KV8,"Wow, I have to say that I have never before written a review for a product, but I definitely think this one is worth it.  I have tried a lot of different aerobic videos, and a lot of them are hard to follow and require a ton of kicking and squats which I can't do because my knees are not so great.  This tape on the other hand is completely different than any other tape I've owned.  It's fun!!  The 45 minute workout flew by and I had a great time doing it and I could feel myself getting a good workout.  I am by no means a dancer, but I was more than able to keep up with the moves and follow what was going on.  This was a great investment and I would recommend it to anyone.",1208390400,,680,3.856115107913669
3269902,5,B000YV1KV8,"As usual, Alison does a really good job! Fun, effective workout, interesting moves ( contrary to some other reviewers, I do not consider them to be difficult to learn ). 45 minutes is over before you know it!!",1208304000,,209,4.526315789473684
3269903,5,B000YV1KV8,"I was a little unsure on how this one was going to be based on the Cardio Dance Slim Down, but I was NOT disappointed!
This video was SO much fun!  I didn't even feel like I was working out!  Not even half way through it you will be sweating like crazy!
The moves are a little hard to get right away, but Alison gives you a lot of times through them, that by the last rep you got it!
I'll definately keep this one in my rotation!!!!",1207785600,,432,3.897727272727273
3269904,2,B000YV1KV8,WHEN I PURCHASED THE VIDEO I FIGURED IT WOULD BE A FUN WAY TO EXERCISE SINCE IT INCORPORATED DANCE MOVES INTO THE WORKOUT...UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS JUST TOO HARD FOR ME TO KEEP UP WITH THE MOVES...I SPENT MORE TIME TRYING TO LEARN THE MOVES THAN ACTUALLY EXERCISING.,1207353600,3,263,4.617021276595745
3269905,4,B000YV1KV8,"I LOVE this workout. I am old Firm Believer and some of the newer releases have been very disappointing. Cardio Dance Fusion is very fast paced, excellently cued, and just a plain fun workout. Alison does a great job of getting you through the steps at tempo so after a playing or two, you have most of the moves down. I'm not a dancer nor am I terribly graceful, however by the third playing, I had the steps all down pretty well. At least well enough to really enjoy the dances. I have RA so I was concerned about my joints but no worries with this workout. Just plently of fun, sweat and calorie burning. I actually want to work out with this one! Don't let the express workout option fool you. They may be shorter, but you'll still have the heart rate way up there! If you're looking for an excuse to do cardio more often, this is it :-)",1207353600,,841,4.229813664596273
3269906,5,B000YV1KV8,"I'll admit that I was frustrated the first time I tried to do this workout but did work up a sweat while trying to keep up. The next day I was determined to learn this, so I just did each section over and over until I got it down, while taking breaks in between. I ended up having so much fun that I did the workout again later in the day. I now use this as a warm up almost every day doing only the fist two sections, which are club dance and salsa dance, and then move on to another firm workout. I love the music and admit this is one of my new favorite firms for the fun factor of it.",1207008000,,588,3.7886178861788617
3269907,2,B000YV1KV8,"This video states on the back that no dance experience is required and two left feet will not stop you ... WELL, I don't have two left feet and have been successful with dance videos on my cardio days but not this one.  The moves are too complex and not called effectively enough to enable you to maintain a cardiovascular workout and follow along.  I found myself subtituting jumping jacks and jump rope moves to maintain my heart rate when the choreography got too difficult.  I still recommend The Firm Cardio Dance Slimdown for an easier to follow more effective workout.  Don't always believe what you read on the back of those DVD sleeves.",1207008000,15,645,4.631578947368421
3269908,4,B000YV1KV8,"I'm not terribly coordinated, so I usually stay away from alot of dancy stuff.  I end up spending half the time at a low heart rate as I struggle through the moves.  And while I didn't hit every step perfectly the first time on this one, I was able to keep up and get in a good workout.  The girls really look like they're having fun, too.  I like the fact that this doesn't require any equipment, so I can take it on the road with me.  Sometimes I wish the camera had more full-body shots so I could see Alison's feet, but I'll figure it out.  This is FAR better than the Firm's ""Cardio Dance Slimdown"", although I love the instructor, Allie.  Castmember Emily is sporting a cute new 'do and a rockin' bod-- very inspirational for us moms!

3269909,5,B000YV1KV8,This is a very intense workout but you don't even feel it as you're doing it - its too much fun to be called a workout. You should preview it a couple of times before actually doing it as the steps are kind of tricky at first. Highly recommended!!,1206576000,,247,4.061224489795919
3269910,2,B000YV1KV8,I was so hoping that I would be able to pick up the dance moves and follow along with Alison and her girls. She is my favorite Firm instructor and I have always been able to follow the steps of her various Firm workouts. I could not keep up with the moves on Cardio dance fusion although I did enjoy watching and I liked the music in the background.,1205193600,7,349,4.072463768115942
8234065,3,B000YV1KV8,"I bought this Workout because I wanted/needed a Workout that didn't include the use of Weights. I've checked through all of ""THE FIRM"" WORKOUTS. Most of them require Weights. My understanding of WEIGHT WORKOUTS is to allow the body to recover between workouts. Since I needed some Cardio and trust ""THE FIRM"", I found this Workout to be useful. I really don't like Dance Workouts because I can't ever seem to get the steps right, though it's not the ""getting the steps right"" that will literally get a person in shape. This workout start fast right away. I thought that a Warm Up is suppose to help ease the body into the rest of the routine. I have used this Workout exactly Fifteen Times, and I still haven't learned the steps. It's one Long 45 Minutes Improvisation. I don't Jump, Twist, or Hop. I've changed most of the moves to accommodate what I can physically do. I don't agree that a Person need to be a Professional Dancer to learn this workout. Anything done enough times will help a person get good at it. I have gotten better. I don't particularly like this Routine. And I don't think that it's really a ""Dance Program"". I've had some Programs that are Dancier than this one. What I mean is, some of the moves are not, in my opinion, Dancing. I have noticed definition in my legs, of course. I don't know, though, if I've lost any weight, because I don't know how much I weighed before I began this Program. I plan to use this program until SEPTEMBER 02, 2017. And then I will rotate it out. I've been using this Program with ""THE FIRM"": FIRM PARTS, ""STANDING LEGS"", since JUNE 27, 2017. I will rotate ""STANDING LEGS"" for a different ""THE FIRM"" EXERCISE PROGRAM SOON. As soon as I get some of the Equipment that I need, I will rotate it out. Someone's review said that this Workout is the same as ""CARDIO OVERDRIVE"". But that can't be because that workout uses Weights. Someone else's review said this Workout is the same AS "" CARDIO DANCE EXPRESS"". If it is, then shame on the MARKETERS for changing the title, tricking the Exercisers into thinking that they have a different workout. I could only give this Workout THREE STARS: One for the Price. One for it being a Workout from ""THE FIRM"" without the use of Weights. And the last star is for the Length of the Workout. I'm going to be glad when it's time to rotate this Workout, out.",1501632000,,2348,4.462790697674419
8234066,5,B000YV1KV8,"This is a good workout.  The same video is found under The FIRM's ""Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection"" under the title  'Cardio Overdrive' (exact same workout) which is a great video and would save $$ as you get 4 workouts instead of only one!!",1491350400,,241,4.714285714285714
8234067,4,B000YV1KV8,"This is a fast paced workout. Very little instruction before launching into the moves. However, after a few goes at it I started to catch on more and  found it fun to do. Alison Davis is an enjoyable instructor.",1490918400,,211,4.410256410256411

8234070,4,B000YV1KV8,"Good workout! Big fan of the firm. I have tons of them. This one is really fun and complicated enough to keep me on my toes. My only criticism would be the instructors inconsistent direction. Sometimes she mixes directions to go right or left (the firm instructors typically mirror your movements facing you and provide directions based on the way you, the viewer, would be moving. So they tell you to go right and they actually move to their left, mirroring your movement. This is something I've always loved about their tapes. Allie (?) does the best job with instructions. This particular video the instructor doesn't do as good a job) however it's still super fun and I swear my butt off :) definitely recommend this one for a good dancy calorie burn!",1431648000,,755,4.684210526315789
