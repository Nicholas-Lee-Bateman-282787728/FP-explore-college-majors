8249116,1,B00133QNSQ,"This so-called movie looked like a Mondrian after the artist tripped on acid. I thought something was wrong with my DVD player at first. I should have read the reviews before purchasing this piece of ""artistic"" garbage. You get nothing but pixilating dancing colors that could make you go blind along with a droning and sometimes inaudible narration over the whole thing. This should not even be listed on Amazon. I bought the DVD because of the director and a couple of the actors. The pictures on the front and back can't even be seen in this so-called movie since it was filmed on a cell phone!",1471219200,,597,4.588785046728972

8249119,1,B00133QNSQ,"I purchased this out of curiosity.  I should have followed the advice in the other review and saved my money.  It is a piece of crap.  Most of the time I had no idea what I was seeing.  And the narration became very quickly very tiresome.

A total waste of time and money.  I gave it one star only because I wasn't able to give it none.",1381363200,,336,3.9402985074626864
