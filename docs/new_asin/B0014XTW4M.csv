It delivered wonderful messages that we all should live by and many episodes made us laugh out loud.  Other episodes were so relative to tragedies that occur everyday that go un-noticed, and even the coldest heart would need tissues; I guarantee it.

I also love""Touched by an Angel"" and have the the first 3.5 seasons and could not understand why the remaining seasons had not been released. When they were, I was appalled at the over inflated cost of remaining seasons. GREED (i wonder who it was that demanded higher royalties) has to be the reason for the seasons going from $20. to over $40. per season. Yes, I love the show, but WILL NOT pay the season's asking price, out of principle and the collection will never be completed.",1422489600,,656,4.5210084033613445

No caption or subtitles (what a shame - older folks are probably the main buyers).  Others are probably more a tune to poor quality reproduction than I am, but it was visible to me.  Now the company has come out with season's 1-5, instead of selling just season 5.  We will skip season 5.  It is a shame that such an outstanding show was not reproduced by better company than Mill Creek.  Mill Creek is consistent in not supplying caption or subtitles.",1408924800,,602,4.265486725663717

3370466,5,B0014XTW4M,"I just completed watching season four and was delighted with the integrity of the theme. Season five was shipped and is on the way. I waited years to complete this series. I also love""Touched by an Angel"" and have the the first 3.5 seasons and could not understand why the remaining seasons had not been released. When they were, I was appalled at the over inflated cost of remaining seasons. GREED (i wonder who it was that demanded higher royalties) has to be the reason for the seasons going from $20. to over $40. per season. Yes, I love the show, but WILL NOT pay the season's asking price, out of principle and the collection will never be completed.",1422489600,,656,4.5210084033613445

:D My eldest niece is 11, my baby niece is a year and 1/2 and my nephew is 9. You're never to young or to little to understand about love, forgiveness, compassion and friend. These are the lessons taught by this series. The warmth and love of family, miracles etc. :D God bless you always, Michael Landon and Victor French. You are greatly missed. :)",1410739200,,567,4.308411214953271

I also appreciate that the price is so reasonable for this series--and the DVDs are great quality.",1409270400,,336,4.1692307692307695

No caption or subtitles (what a shame - older folks are probably the main buyers).  Others are probably more a tune to poor quality reproduction than I am, but it was visible to me.  Now the company has come out with season's 1-5, instead of selling just season 5.  We will skip season 5.  It is a shame that such an outstanding show was not reproduced by better company than Mill Creek.  Mill Creek is consistent in not supplying caption or subtitles.",1408924800,,602,4.265486725663717

Highway to Heaven is a feel-good show, but there are many times when you may cry. If you like Michael Landon, then most likely you will appreciate this show.
