2828537,5,B000PWQP98,"My four year old granddaughter wanted to watch this DVD over and over and over and over when she stayed with us for four days.  Personally, I was about ready to puke if I had to watch it one more time....BUT, it is a good film for the preschool age group.  It's just the right length to hold their attention, but not so long that they vegetate in front of the TV for a large portion of the day.  I used it as a reward for good behavior taking a bath and getting teeth brushed before bed.  It was a perfect way to get her wound down and ready to sleep.  It has a good message about being happy with what we have going; because even though the grass looks greener on the other side, it usually isn't.  Highly recommend and I'm on-line right now to buy 2 or 3 more Eloise movies.",1208736000,16,776,4.03921568627451
2828538,4,B000PWQP98,This found a happy home in our collection of DVD's for our grandchildren.  Our 2 grand-daughters were never once bored yet wanted for there to be more to the story once the end was reached.  I would encourage anyone interested to give Eloise a try!!!,1206403200,6,250,4.533333333333333

2828542,5,B000PWQP98,"I'm not a huge fan of Eloise myself -- she's pretty much a spoiled brat -- but she does have a good heart. My granddaughter loves these movies, and when Netflix lost the streaming rights I bought all of them. This one came quickly and well packaged.",1356220800,,249,4.319148936170213
2828543,4,B000PWQP98,"Good points:
This represents the negative aspects of schooling in comic form, but also doesn't come across as rampantly anti-school...just points out that school isn't something that is wonderful for everyone, and highlights alternatives to being schooled, in a positive way. It also highlights the importance of keeping true to yourself in the face of pressure to conform or to submit to authority regardless of the situation without using your judgement. It has good messages about peer pressure, bullying, and standing up for what's right, even against the crowd.

Eloise made the comment in the movie, of ""I don't go to school. School comes to me!"" and that helped validate homeschooling to my daughter by giving her a popular fictional character to identify with in that regard. This particular episode will be funny to both schooled kids, and unschooled or homeschooled kids, because those who have gone to school can generally relate to some of the jokes, whereas those who haven't gone to school will still get it, but also be happy about one of the few mainstream productions that depicts their school-free lifestyle in a positive way.

Now to the negatives:

Eloise is indeed, bratty. I would not recommend this for the very young children who might take on Eloise as a role model at a very impressionable age. It pays to keep in mind that Eloise was originally written for the amusement of adults, as a sort of in-joke about kids and their antics. Kids old enough to get the irony, are definitely old enough to enjoy it without harm.

Overall, the cartoon series does a good job of being true to the original Eloise books, and Tim Curry brings something magnificently lush to the role of Mr. Salamone. This episode in particular just happens to speak about school in a way that school kids can groan about, and school-free kids can ponder when they wonder what they are missing. I can't help but like the series, because it is authentic, and refreshingly different from the usual in kids' programming. Another thing I love is that the vocabulary and grammar are not ""dumbed down"" in this series. It's one of the few places you'll hear a phrase like ""...that's she!"" instead of the common, but incorrect ""...that's her!"" and I appreciate the sophistication it assumes on the part of the audience.",1353888000,3,2306,4.860050890585241
2828544,5,B000PWQP98,"This story finds Eloise in the thick of things again at the Plaza Hotel and she finally offends her teacher and enrolls in a private school.

Quite charming and my 6 year old enjoyed every minute of Eloise finding out her tutor was not so bad after all.

If your child loves Eloise she or he will be delighted with this DVD.",1349481600,,324,4.209677419354839

2828547,5,B000PWQP98,"Very nicely done, and so entertaining they watch the same one almost every day. I think their Mom and Dad are just a little sick of Eloise, but they continue to be entertained. Very worthwhile.",1246665600,,193,4.542857142857143
2828548,5,B000PWQP98,"My 4.5 year-old has only recently started enjoying the animated show centered on precocious 6-year-old Eloise. In ""Eloise Goes to School"", Eloise's tutor quits and nanny makes arrangements for Eloise to attend the snooty Hawthorne school. There, Eloise finds herself feeling awkward and tries hard to fit in but has to face a myriad of problems such as an overly strict teacher, bullies etc. In her signature indomitable way, Eloise tries to sort these problems out, but is left pondering whether the school is really a right fit for her?

The Eloise stories are great fun for young girls, and my little girl has become a fan. Sometimes caution does need to be exercised when viewing this with younger children as Eloise's manner may come across as almost bratty, though she is mostly just verbally and emotionally advanced for her age and very expressive. On the whole, the DVDs are enjoyable and great fun!",1244678400,4,908,4.896103896103896
