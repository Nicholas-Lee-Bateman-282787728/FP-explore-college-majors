We have all three in the set but this is the only one we have watched so far. I only have one complaint about this and that is the use of the baby voice to introduce each section. It sounds cute but some words are either mispronounced or difficult to understand. I know it's all part of the theme but a ""cleaner"" voice would make it perfect. With that said, I love this as much as my 26 month old twin boys do. It is visually compelling and the musical selections are very nice. I will recommend this to friends.",1142208000,19,640,4.38655462184874
2328145,5,B0009WIE3O,"If your baby is going to own one DVD collection, this should be it.  We have all of the competitors, but once we bought this colection, it is all we watch.  It s beautiful, clever, and educational (both for parents and baby).  The music is fabulous as well, no omre of that pretend-classical music (Baby Einstein and friends...), this is the real thing!  I will buy it for every baby shower and birthday party from now on!",1126310400,13,422,4.441558441558442

2328156,5,B0009WIE3O,"Love this video! And my grandchildren have all loved it. Very creative use of art pictures, animating them to songs, having an audience of sweet animated circus animals applauding.

My wife and I both have enjoyed and learned a few things from these.",1441670400,2,338,4.059701492537314

2328169,5,B0009WIE3O,Desperate for a break but don't want to ruin your baby with TV shows. Baby Einstein is cheap and annoying. Do yourself a favor and buy all Classical Baby dvds. These have the best artwork and the best music. We have been watching these for the last 6 months and my 16 month old twins still love it. And I don't feel guilty showing it to them. We used to watch this during mealtime tantrums and now we just watch it every am to ease into the day at 6:30 am. Trust me....you won't be disappointed.,1428883200,,495,4.166666666666667

2328184,5,B0009WIE3O,"My children loved all of the Baby Classical.  They would sit in front of the TV from infants & be glued to it.  It is also pleasant to listen to while you try to get somethings done while they are preoccupied.  Much better than listening to Dora or Barney.  I would rather get Classical Baby stuck in my head for the day than one of those.  They are now 5 & & YO and if I turn it on, they still sit & watch it.",1412380800,,410,3.776470588235294

2328187,5,B0009WIE3O,"My son has adored all three, music/dance and art. We try not to watch too much of anything with him, but the truth is, he hasn't really been interested in anything else on the TV, while these hold him spellbound (which is nice when he needs to wind down before a nap or I have to make dinner). We never watch more than one of these a day and put them on a rotation.

It is true that there are certain segments that lose him (like the Ugly Duckling segment on the dance video), and some segments he had to grow to like, but on the whole, this is a total hit.

For us, as adults, its wonderful that we can enjoy this music as well, and many of the animated sequences are top-notch, while a few are brilliant.",1405382400,,706,4.071942446043166

She watches it over and over and has her favorite sketches, she bounces up and down when she hears the intro. It is precious, darling and beautiful. Her 3-1/2 y/o brother thinks it for girls, but he likes it too! (It's on YouTube, but I didn't know that!)",1402099200,,405,4.486486486486487
2328190,5,B0009WIE3O,"I love it. It is HBOs great production. Baby can listen to it and watch it again and again, and it is so well done, we do not mind repeating it for her, again and again. I love this DVD is excellent.
The only downside it is that if you live in Europe you need the kind of DVD that plays universally all formats.

2328205,5,B0009WIE3O,"We LOVE Classical Baby by HBO. My only complaint is that there aren't more than four movies in the series. Our son started with the Music Show around 10 months old and fell in love. The Art Show is just as good and just as loved. He claps along with the animals and stares, absolutely captivated, at all of the pictures. These videos are a parent's dream; no annoying narrator, no annoying music, and no ridiculous characters. My son is now almost two years old and prefers these, without question, to any other kids' shows. We prefer these for car rides and around quiet time. These videos are very calming and beautiful.",1392854400,,622,4.5625

2328211,5,B0009WIE3O,"I just gave this gift to my 15 month old niece tonight and she absolutely loved it. As soon as I hit play, she was enthralled. The segments are so beautifully created with a baby in mind and the music is so relaxing. She also loved the baby conductor that 'conducts' the segments and would say, ""Baby!"" and ""Hi, baby!"" every time it was on the screen. She would wave at the baby, clap between segments when the animal audience clapped, and would sigh and exclaim and jabber while paintings would come to life. She fell asleep at about the 20 minute mark (it's a little over 26min long) and it was adorable. Definitely recommend this for children of artists and art lovers!",1387584000,,672,4.471544715447155

2328225,5,B0009WIE3O,"Our grandchildren are now ages six and five, and have loved the Classical Baby series of DVD's since they were infants.  They are appealing videos as well as having ""real"" classical music played by instruments, not music boxes !  In addition, the DVD's contain many famous works of art, so the children become familiar with great music and great art, while they are being entertained and stimulated !  We've particularly liked Baby Art, Baby Music, and Baby Dance !  Thank you, Amy Schatz !",1380672000,,490,4.7976190476190474
2328226,5,B0009WIE3O,"I had boy/girl twins in January of 2012.  When the babies were as young as 3 months old, we began searching for videos that our babies would enjoy and ran across this series on HBO. Somewhat similar to the concept of Baby Einstein or Baby Mozart, these captured our babies' attention far longer and they still watch these nightly at 18 months old.  Once the opening intro song starts, both babies would stop whatever they were doing and cuddle up with us to watch their favorite little baby conductor! Worried that we might accidentally erase these from our DVR cable box, I got online and ordered them right away.  This is one of my TOP FIVE favorite things that I have purchased for the babies.  Each time we turn it on to calm a crying child or prepare for bed, we are amazed and how much they still love, enjoy and are still very interested in this video after seeing it at least 200 times.....not exaggerating...probably closer to 300 times!

I have to say that my babies absolutely love this video along with the Classical Baby Music and Classical Baby Dance videos.  The music in all three videos is, well, classical and the videos that play along are both colorful and entertaining. I can't imagine what our life would be like had we not found these and would highly recommend them to others in hopes that their babies love them as much as mine have and still do!",1374451200,,1371,4.508064516129032

2328233,3,B0009WIE3O,The videos are nice but it seems like this is marketed to parents who are hoping their kids will become cultured as a result of watching a video about art. The only problem is that kids aren't interesting in watching it.,1364428800,,220,4.390243902439025

My daughter is 8 and still enjoys watching this and talking about which one was her favorite from when she was ""little"". I like that this series exposes kids to lots of different things.

2328256,5,B0009WIE3O,We are big fans of Classical Baby the Music Show and when we found this movie we had to buy. We love this one too. We love the music and the different art that it shows us. I love how there are little people or animals that do things around the art or how it starts from the first of how the picture was drawn. My two year old loves clapping and acting like the animals after each little show. I love to watch it and so does my two year old. Very fun colorful relaxing show the whole family LOVES it. A must buy,1306022400,,511,3.876190476190476
2328257,5,B0009WIE3O,"My son loves this video even more than I possibly could have imagined. I have an extensive art background and only secretly wish that my son will appreciate art as much as I do. When I purchased this at a local bookstore, I was skeptical that it could capture his attention because it wasn't tactile, like a book. I was completely wrong!!! He adores the baby, the frogs, the colors and music. He is captured by the shapes, even going so far as to try to say ""circle"", ""triangle"" and ""line"". He claps each time with the ""audience"" and looks at us as if we should too. It isn't uncommon for him to want to watch it multiple times in a row, and occasionally we let him. This is my son's favorite DVD, even over Kipper and Caillou.",1304121600,,727,4.27536231884058
2328258,5,B0009WIE3O,"The whole HBO series Classical Baby is so good. It is mesmerizing to the young set (and I must admit the grandparents as well) weaving together famous works of art and music.  And for those who think these lessons are not imprinted upon the minds of these youngsters, consider that my grandson, now 8, who watched this as a baby recognized works of art at the Art Museum specifically from this DVD as well as some of the music.  A wonderful introduction to the arts!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",1300147200,2,486,4.563218390804598

The classical music is wonderful and the works of art are integrated in an interesting manner to capture little imaginations.  This has always been a stand-by DVD for bedtime, naptime, or anytime I need my boys to calm down and rest.  It is calming but not boring-truly a masterpiece in and of itself!  Again, cannot recommend enough!",1293235200,,457,4.6625

It is their favorite ""Classical Baby""! I definitely recommend it to anyone with a young child.",1256256000,,406,4.259740259740259
2328262,5,B0009WIE3O,"I just wanted to add my endorsement with a little twist from anything else I've seen written. Yes, it will entertain both you and your infant, the music is beautiful, the art/animation is captivating, but what I have to say is that it is actually quite moving. The pairing of the music with the images elicits some unexpected emotions (for a kids' DVD!) - I find myself getting a bit ""verklemt"" at several of them. There are a lot of touching little moments between cartoon animals and babies, as well as a series of paintings of mothers and babies, and thanks also to the music, I find them really poignant. It's a really special treat to watch this with my 6-month-old (or, admittedly, just a nice break occasionally!), and it always reminds me how precious and marvelous my time with her is. And that's possible because it captivates - and therefore silences - her as much as me! :)

The video consists of animation of famous works of art accompanied by instrumental music. There are soothing, softer works as well as abstract art with jazz accompaniment. It is well-made and contains not one hint of the typical kid-video annoyances. The segments are short enough to maintain the attention of our 16 month old, but not choppy. My husband and I love how beautifully done it is; even our friends who have babysat for us comment on how much they love watching it! I cannot tell you how many times I have watched it with my son on sick days and I never mind popping it in to enjoy together again.",1234742400,,811,4.370860927152318
2328274,5,B0009WIE3O,"Not as get-up-and-dance inspiring as The Dance Show, this volume nevertheless does a great job of introducing great works of art to the younger crowd.",1232150400,,150,5.04
2328275,4,B0009WIE3O,"I was worried that this DVD would be rejected out of hand by one of the two children to whom we gave it.  My worry was for naught.  The very active, just turned two years old child actually watched it and became fascinated by Miro shapes and the frog conductor.  Now it is requested during play time, providing music, art and information amidst the clatter of toys. Even now, questions come up about the music and art, even when I think the child is not watching. Soon we will go to a real art museum!",1231545600,,501,4.252631578947368
2328276,5,B0009WIE3O,My daughter started watching these at 12 months and loves them.  I actually enjoy them more than any other baby programs too.  All of them are also great for watching before bed.,1231372800,,178,4.53125
2328277,5,B0009WIE3O,"This marvelous series is ""must have"" for parents, grandparents and child care givers to share with their youngsters.  It introduces them to the world of beautiful music classics brought to life through interesting, colorful animation.  I imagine the children will experience pleasant feelings whenever they hear these songs throughout their entire lives.

He gets excited when ""Trucks"" comes on he claps with the animals after every ""show."" I highly recommend this DVD. The other ones are good as well but this one is the best by far!",1224028800,,354,4.071428571428571

Adorable animation, famous works of art, breathtaking and moving music all combine to relax and entertain the entire family.  THIS is what I expected Baby Einstein would be!

2328281,5,B0009WIE3O,"This is such a refreshing change from all the Baby Einstein videos. They are good but too many of a good idea drained dry, if you know what I mean. CLASSICAL BABY: THE ART SHOW is for all ages - it relaxed me as well as my 5 1/2 month old.

Music by Strauss, DeBussy, Duke Ellington (to name a few) play as the screen shows slow moving closeups of paintings. All are conducted by a precious little baby conductor. VERY engaging to watch.",1184630400,3,437,4.2023809523809526

The music is beautiful and the visuals are simple and eye catching.  I studied art history and am impressed by the unique way of introducing fine art to an infant.  My son still loves it now at 15 months and has learned to clap with the characters and he dances when the jazz song comes on.  Even my husband enjoys watching it...over and over and over.  We have The music show and the dance show too, but the Art Show is our favorite.",1167868800,6,547,4.074766355140187

The music and animation are both first rate.  It is also educational for parents, who will be exposed to composers and artists who are used in the series. We discovered this 9 years ago through HBO.  We must have watched close to 1000 hours of the music, dance, and art shows with our daughter through her 4th birthday, and although she doesn't have any interest in it these days, I could watch it and enjoy it today.",1481155200,,562,4.534653465346534
