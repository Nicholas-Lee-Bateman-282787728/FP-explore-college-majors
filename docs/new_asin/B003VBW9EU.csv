8406674,3,B003VBW9EU,"This DVD managed to begin with Darwin's most famous quote that suggests Intelligent Design and then show the overall ""proof"" behind Creationism without giving little more than the opening quote to nail the arguments behind Intelligent Design as tightly as I've seen them shown.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone with some (a smidgion would be sufficient) scientific logic and a willingness to recognize where the arguments were carried just a bit too far ... yet, recognize the power of the arguments against Evolution as it is taught in modern schools.

Generally speaking, this is a great video to use to make people at least think more deeply about evolutionary theory and the arguments for God by observing His Grand Design.

The three star review was simply a recognition that Intelligent Design can stand on its own scientific precepts more than this video allowed it to--with its over-emphasis on religious narrative here and there.",1310083200,,943,5.070967741935484
