5087718,3,B007I1Q508,"These are very old films with talented stars. The dvd was in excellent shape and played well.  But I was looking for the ""The FIRST traveling saleslady.",1391299200,2,152,4.62962962962963
5087719,5,B007I1Q508,I love the snappy rapport between Farrell and Blondel. I hate to sound cliche but they don't make them like this any more. DVD arrived promptly in advertised condition.,1372377600,7,168,4.827586206896552

8517104,5,B007I1Q508,"both are cleverly written movies filled with snappy patter from Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell.  I would recommend both to anyone who loves movies from the 30s that highlights the era's wit and grace.  The clothes, buildings and homes are highlighted, but most of all is the dialog.",1492819200,,284,4.895833333333333
8517105,5,B007I1Q508,"This was produced in the 1930s.
I enjoyed this movie. Thank you.",1490400000,,64,4.416666666666667
8517106,3,B007I1Q508,"Two of those movies they ground out like hamburger.  Joan Blondell was a beauty but in  second film hardly there.  Her Marine boy friend had different stripes in different scenes. No time for ""continuity"".  Fun.. but  only that.",1461024000,,228,4.894736842105263
8517107,5,B007I1Q508,Wish there were more Joan Blondell movies available!,1440460800,,52,5.625
8517108,4,B007I1Q508,"I'm a sucker for Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell made a perfect comedy partner for her. These two sprightly programmer pictures from the Warner Brothers movie factory of the 30s may be dated and slightly plotted, but they have a lot of joyous bounce.",1434067200,2,251,4.7272727272727275

8517111,5,B007I1Q508,"30's light comedy at its best! A Joan Blondell two-fer is worth the $15 bucks, good quality remastering on these two short features (each movie is about an hour long) that definitely satisfy!",1426896000,2,191,4.818181818181818
8517112,3,B007I1Q508,i'm a big fan of joan blondell but these two movies were really boring.i wouldn't reccomend them.don't waste your money.,1403395200,,120,5.05
8517113,5,B007I1Q508,"Glenda Farrell was pretty neat, but Joan Blondell was without a doubt.  She was most assuredly the sweetheart of the 30's.
She just had personality coming out of her pores, and, of course, she was the ultimate sex bomb, on top of it.
Most of the time, she pretty much steals any picture she's in, and the rest of the cast just sort of revolves around her.
She may have been at her ultimate peak form in ""Gold Diggers of 1933,"" but, ironically, Aline MacMahon just about stole that picture away from her - through absolutely no fault of Joan Blondell, but to the distinct credit of Ms. MacMahon.",1403136000,2,594,4.4495412844036695
