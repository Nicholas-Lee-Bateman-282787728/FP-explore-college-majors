6599444,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"This is one of my all time favorite films. I saw it at our local Native American Film Festival in 2013 and it was definitely the best film I saw that year.  It's a true family film that's suitable for all ages. I have since bought the DVD and am looking forward to watching it again, and again....",1422489600,,297,4.120689655172414
6599445,5,B00MQ6NGUW,That guest star appearance from Stan Main really makes the picture.,1422489600,,67,5.181818181818182
6599446,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"Won a couple awards at Buffalo Niagara Film Festival, and well deserved I may add. Watch this indie gem!",1422403200,2,104,4.526315789473684

6599448,4,B00MQ6NGUW,"What a wonderful, moving movie that will pull at your heart strings. Not only does it overflow with acceptance, love,compassion and kind nature, it is also beautifully filmed cinematography with striking settings,costumes and outstanding performances from the actors. Truly a joy to watch.",1481241600,,289,5.744186046511628

6599450,4,B00MQ6NGUW,"Maybe the actors are not high ranking professionals, but well done.  Enjoyed this little movie.  The story itself is worth a watch.",1470873600,,131,4.909090909090909
6599451,4,B00MQ6NGUW,"This is a movie about true love, with  gentleness and redemption after affliction and privation. I would like to see movies like this all the time; movies about decency instead of uninterrupted violence. I especially liked the animation, which provided some lightheartedness in a serious movie. Depictions of  the lack of tolerance and racism were horrible, but still gently done enough that I watched the whole movie.  I appreciated seeing pictures of the Seneca culture, lands and people as I haven't been to New York. I would like to visit sometime. Movie Benefactors-It was time  and money well spent.",1468022400,2,605,5.08080808080808

6599453,2,B00MQ6NGUW,"The story line is good but the actors and the dialog is awful. If they would have gotten better actors, the story would have really been a hit. Don't waste your time on this one and that is all I have to say about this one.",1463875200,,223,3.869565217391304

6599457,3,B00MQ6NGUW,"Overlook the simplicity of it, and enjoy the story. It is worth watching.",1457308800,2,73,4.6923076923076925
6599458,3,B00MQ6NGUW,"Good story, but the acting was somewhat boring.",1456963200,,47,5.0
6599459,5,B00MQ6NGUW,This film is truly a gift from the heart!  Im always looking for films that resonate deep within and have long lasting benefits.  I have been blessed to have known many people with developmental disabilities and now I have been given the vantage point of knowing how the Seneca native culture has treated these people in their society.  They have given them the highest level of respect and treated them with human dignity & compassion.,1454284800,2,436,4.786666666666667
6599460,3,B00MQ6NGUW,Interesting,1454025600,,11,11.0
6599461,1,B00MQ6NGUW,"Looks like it was filmed with Phone Cam....Acting?  What acting...I was so board, that i skipped to the end, and I've already forgot how it ended while writing this review.",1452556800,,172,4.733333333333333

6599464,2,B00MQ6NGUW,not so good,1440979200,,11,3.0
6599465,4,B00MQ6NGUW,I was very moved by this story of one society culture rejecting and another society culture that was embracing. It is true that people with handicaps are often shunned. And it is true their are those people that understand the human obligation to care for each other.,1438300800,2,267,4.702127659574468
6599466,5,B00MQ6NGUW,A must-see for all Americans and those wanting the truth about the colonization.,1438300800,,80,5.230769230769231
6599467,1,B00MQ6NGUW,I did not like it so I did not finish it,1435795200,,40,2.727272727272727
6599468,3,B00MQ6NGUW,"I watched the entire movie. The best actors were the ""special"" actors like the main character. They are great actors. There should be more movies out there like this one.",1432944000,2,170,4.7
6599469,3,B00MQ6NGUW,"This was a really good story, but it wasn't especially well done. I suspect a low budget was likely to blame. It is still well worth watching.",1430784000,,142,4.296296296296297
6599470,4,B00MQ6NGUW,I liked this movie. It showed what real love and forgiveness looks like in action.,1430265600,,82,4.533333333333333
6599471,4,B00MQ6NGUW,emotional and compelling,1430006400,,24,7.333333333333333
6599472,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Great Movie with a Fantastic musical background. Worth watching!,1428364800,2,64,6.222222222222222
6599473,4,B00MQ6NGUW,Will probably watch it again,1428192000,,28,4.8
6599474,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Heartfelt story. This movie demonstrates the ignorance and intolerance towards those who are physically and/or mentally challenged. It is not meant to entertain but to teach! Especially poignant for young children.,1428019200,2,214,5.935483870967742
6599475,4,B00MQ6NGUW,This was an interesting film that initially demonstrated the ignorance and disrespect that occurred in the 1800's towards children and people with special needs. It amazingly shows the current acting and other abilities that our people with special needs can display. I am hopeful that it points out how everyone deserves equal respect regardless of their different abilities.,1427760000,2,376,5.5
6599476,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"My brother Adrian created this movie. I loved it, I recommend teachers to use this movie as a teaching tool for their students. It shows acceptance, understanding, caring, love, tolerance, etc. I could go on.",1427328000,3,208,4.9714285714285715
6599477,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Great film for the whole family.  This movie explores discrimination and racism with a intertwining characters and events.  The film shows the Iroquois people and culture as it is accepting of all people despite their differences.  As a society we have a great deal to learn from this film.,1427068800,2,290,4.877551020408164
6599478,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"An amazing story of compassion, acceptance and tolerance.  The world could use the lesson from this story",1426723200,,105,5.176470588235294
6599479,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Bury my heart with tonawanda was a great movie. This is a true story and it was heart felt. I would see this movie over and over,1426636800,,128,3.7777777777777777
6599480,1,B00MQ6NGUW,"I had found this movie randomly when I was on Amazon Prime looking for new movies to watch. So I sat through the entire think, laughing my head off. This movie is unintentionally hilarious! From the laughable acting to the lifeless characters, just wow! I laughed the most when the main character was leaving to go to ""Asylum for Idiots"" and the maid intentionally keeps the lock on the vehicle door unlocked, and nobody notices! I mean well, everyone was looking at it and no character seemed to notice. And the 10 minute random pioneer story that had nothing to do with the plot? Just wow! This movie will give you a great laugh the entire time. If you enjoyed Sharknado or The Room, you will have fun with this ""film"".",1426636800,,721,4.511450381679389
6599481,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Wonderful film. Recommend for all.,1426550400,,34,6.0
6599482,5,B00MQ6NGUW,An excellent film!  So much meaning and history rolled into an enjoyable to watch family friendly movie.  Worth watching more than once.  Plan to be inspired.,1426550400,,158,5.0
6599483,5,B00MQ6NGUW,A wonderful movie which everyone should watch! You will learn so much about Haudenosaunee culture and ways.  This unique film has a never before seen perspective about acceptance and love.,1426550400,,188,5.266666666666667
6599484,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"This true story becomes a Seneca Nation folk tale in this extraordinary film written by Adrian Esposito (diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome) about a boy in 1860 with Down's Syndrome who escapes his cruel father to live on the Tonawanda Reservation. Directed by Gary Sundown (who also stars as Jay Tall Oak), the movie features three actors with Down's Syndrome who portray different stages of John Harrison's life - Colvin Percy, Michael Rice & Stephen Blum. More great casting of Clayton Logan as Chief Red Skye & Magalene Moore-Holly as Diana, the only sympathetic person in the Harrison household. Music from the albums ""Tribal Music Suite: Journey of a Paiute,"" ""Spirit - The Seventh Fire,"" & ""Animal Totems 2.""",1425168000,3,715,5.067796610169491
6599485,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Not the best quality but the message is great,1425081600,,45,4.111111111111111
6599486,5,B00MQ6NGUW,The celebration of being different! This film feels wonderfully old fashioned and its form works splendidly for this tale.  Unwanted by his father a young boys journey to find a place to belong. It is a movie of faith and beauty.,1425081600,,229,4.585365853658536
6599487,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Vary GOOD!!!!!!!I SEEN IT AT LIST #5 THE THE LAST WEEK!!!!!!!!!,1424822400,,63,4.818181818181818
6599488,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"Heartfelt, touching film you can watch with your kids.  Set in a historical period, late 1800s, the film illustrates to viewers that personal differences can be a virtue and tolerance for all is a positive goal. Debunks some stereotypes about Native Americans too.  Nicely done!",1424649600,,278,5.155555555555556
6599489,5,B00MQ6NGUW,A remarkable period film that challenges historical stereotypes about Native Americans through the moving story of a child - affected by Down syndrome - rejected by his family and adopted by the Tonawanda Seneca Nation. An significant theme for the present day since intolerance is making everyday more and more the front page.,1423526400,,327,5.188679245283019
6599490,1,B00MQ6NGUW,"If 0 stars was an option, I would definitely choose that. It was free, and I still feel like I wasted money.",1423267200,,108,3.9545454545454546
6599491,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"It's difficult to find stories like this. The fact that this is a true story, is something else.
Give this a chance!",1423008000,,116,4.318181818181818
6599492,5,B00MQ6NGUW,This powerful true story really moved me. Watch it!,1422748800,,51,4.777777777777778
6599493,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Love this film. An Indie with heart.,1422576000,,36,4.285714285714286
6599494,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Very good movie - especially liked the native American perspective,1422576000,,66,5.7
6599495,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"What a good story. I can't believe it's true. A really touching story about a boy trying to find the right place in life. It's nice to see how far we've come in terms of accepting people that are different. This film reminds us that it wasn't always the case. This film is good for the whole family and a good film to watch with your kids when teaching them about all our differences.

Great production design for an indie film. Great costumes and sets!",1422489600,,453,4.329411764705882
6599496,3,B00MQ6NGUW,"(Excerpted from my own blog; I had a chance to see this at its premiere at the Memorial Art Gallery (MAG) in Rochester, NY.) Filmmaker Adrian Esposito wrote this film about a man with Downs Syndrome in the 1800's who finds help from the local Indians. It's ostensibly a true story and shot around Rochester. The trouble is, the acting and directing were pretty weak, making it feel like a made-for-TV movie. And it appeared to be shot on video and either has an overexposed look, or the MAG's projector was not configured properly. The story is pretty solid, if a bit simplistic, and overall it's pretty good.",1422489600,,609,4.648148148148148
6599497,5,B00MQ6NGUW,Loved this touching film - even more so because it's a true story. A Native American viewpoint not often seen but should be seen more often.,1422489600,,140,4.423076923076923
8673892,4,B00MQ6NGUW,"The storyline for this was excellent, but the acting was pitiful. Every actor sounded like they were just reading a script---especially the father! He was terrible! The only actor who seemed like an ACTOR was the black lady who cared for the boy; she was very realistic and believable when she spoke. All that aside, I still gave it four stars because the story was interesting.",1526428800,,378,4.742424242424242
8673893,3,B00MQ6NGUW,Warm-hearted tale that is perfect for family viewing. It's important to hear the stories and perspective of Native Americans. It's also wonderful to see a main character with Down Syndrome in this film.,1524787200,,202,5.151515151515151
8673894,4,B00MQ6NGUW,"Your heart would have to be made of stone to not be moved by this film. Yes, the acting is amateurish, but it lends itself to the simple authenticity of the movie. The lead actor with down syndrome gives a brave performance that works because it's so sincere and committed. There's beautiful imagery here, some very touching moments, a clever animated interlude and an emotional ending. Not for cynics, but for people who appreciate a quiet, poignant story about compassion winning out over cruelty of those with disabilities.",1524614400,,526,4.988636363636363
8673895,4,B00MQ6NGUW,"The film likely had a pretty low budget, but I'm so glad to have learned of this story. This is what makes indie film so awesome--stories that might get overlooked, don't, because someone with heart brings those stories to the rest of us. I could see this being used in schools, too.",1523923200,,283,4.461538461538462
8673896,4,B00MQ6NGUW,"The story happened close to where I live now. I knew about Mary Jemison, but not about John Harrison. It's a story about how people behave when they value themselves and the rest of humanity. I liked hearing the Seneca language.",1515974400,,228,4.585365853658536
8673897,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"Both a sad and happy historical tearjerker, this film beautifully and subtlety depicts the atrocities of the indigenous of this land, and the discrimination of the disabled of the past that leads to the present.  However, through it all, spirituality abounds.among the natives and the boy who is inflicted with Downs Syndrome. The acting is one of naturalness; in other words, this is NOT a Hollywood version of the Tonawanda Band of Seneca, New York.  I recommend it highly.",1511568000,,475,5.0
8673898,5,B00MQ6NGUW,"I enjoyed this movie very very much, a beautiful story of rejection, and acceptance. The angels were watching and protecting his journey from misery, and hate, to love and joy, and family. The corn doll story was a wonderful teaching, about the reality of our sameness. Great teaching movie for kids, and adults.",1492905600,,312,4.90566037735849
8673899,3,B00MQ6NGUW,"Interesting story about a man born with Downs who escapes his abusive father and finds his way to the Seneca Indian reservation in upstate New York and finds acceptance and love.
The acting is amateurish mostly, Very low budget. The hero's were noble and good. The white people were suitably condescending and racist. Time line from 1860 to 1923.
I enjoyed the story besides the faults and it was a good effort by all involved.
Not a Hollywood blockbuster but a interesting watch.",1491091200,,480,4.795180722891566
8673900,3,B00MQ6NGUW,sorry...it was too slow developing the story...actually quit watching before it was over,1487116800,,88,5.846153846153846
8673901,2,B00MQ6NGUW,Good idea for the plot but it was more like a homemade video. Very amateurish.,1482019200,,78,4.266666666666667
