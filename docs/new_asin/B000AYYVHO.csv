8081117,4,B000AYYVHO,"As far as Beach Boys concerts go, this one won't make anyones top ten. Keep in mind it was a commercial TV enterprise. But the audience is energetic (cute too), and seeing Brian and Carl together on video is something to treasure. Ray Charles performs a magical rendition of Sail On Sailor, which is why I bought it in the first place based on my memory of years ago. Other ""guests"" are hit and miss depending on your taste. This is difficult to find, and if your a Beach Boys junkie (like me), you'll find it a warm addition to your collection. The only place I know of to hear ""The Spirit of Rock & Roll"".",1201737600,2,607,4.241379310344827
8081118,4,B000AYYVHO,"This is a nice show if you can find it.  In attendance are Brian, Mike, Carl, Al and Bruce - RIP Dennis.

Hilights of the show include Ray Charles on piano performing Sail On Sailor with the Boys on background/instruments, Brian on a very energetic debut performance of Spirit of Rock n Roll, Al singing California Dreamin', Carl performing Heaven from his solo album and Bruce singing the first half of Disney Girls.  It also includes all of the songs from their usual setlist.

One could really do without Belinda Carlisle of the GoGo's trying to sing Wouldn't it Be Nice and the 're-imagining' of God Only Knows by whoever that guy was.  Three Dog Night also gets the chance to perform Darlin' - a song originally written for them but then kept by the Boys(good decision!!)  Oh, and the Everly Brothers and their wigs are not to be missed!!

Pro shot with multiple cameras live in front of a great beachgoing crowd.  The DVD has nice pic and sound quality although the Boys overdubbed some of their vocals in the studio after the show.

Truly nice to see Brian up front singing his falsetto parts and looking very energetic, healthy and alive.  A great moment for the band in light of the circumstances at this timeframe in BB history...",1160438400,7,1240,4.595454545454546
