2817930,5,B000PFT3OY,"After reading all the great reviews on this DVD, i decided to get one for myself in Jan 08. Wow, these DVDs are really amazing. I have watched it for more than 4 times and it is really a pleasure to watch these DVDs again and again. The teachings are fabulous, especially topics like ""Mind and its potentials"", ""Presenting the Path"", ""How to Meditate"", ""All about Karma"", ""Wisdom of Emptiness"", etc.

You don't require any knowledge on Buddhism to appreciate these DVDs, cos every teachings is explained in the simplest form and logical way. The topic ""Mind"" is simply impressive and it really ""open"" your mind to understand its potential. I can't really speak high enough on these DVDs, it is really a ""Must Have"".

Look no futher, I STRONGLY recommend these DVDs to anyone who seek for Buddhism teaching, cultivate inner peace, understanding of life and its meaning, etc.

2817931,5,B000PFT3OY,"I first watched these DVD's during my exploration of Tibetan Buddhism a few years ago and immediately became hooked by the wonderful presentaion and summary of the key points of Tibetan Buddhism practice.

I found the DVD's extremely useful in outlining the entire scope of the Buddhist path from the first chapter on the Mind right through to the Introduction to Tantra. I personally really enjoyed seeing Lama Yeshe explain Tantra in that chapter making it sound so wonderful and relevant to helping overcome all our problems and it inspired me to do further study and to read more on all these topics to try and gain a deeper understanding.

Even now I still find it a joy to return to the DVD's to rewatch them again with some new insights obtained each time.",1182470400,25,763,4.686567164179104
2817932,5,B000PFT3OY,"I have owned this 2 disc DVD set for several years.  Because I have been traveling a lot, I found it difficult to find qualified Buddhist teachers. This series allows me to always have great teachers to take with me. Whether I was snow bound in Michigan or in a remote area in New Mexico, I could pop one of the DVD's into my laptop and hear a remarkable teaching.  I have watched each episode many times and I still learn something new. Also, the quality of the production is very high. This DVD set has been invaluable to me as a constant resource of one of the most profound subjects.",1181952000,50,587,4.2792792792792795
2817933,5,B000PFT3OY,"This DVD is a great place to start if you are curious about Tibetan Buddhism.  The teachings are clear and easy to understand.  The presentation of the topics is very informative.  As a result of watching this, I have embarked on the Discovering Buddhism at Home series of 14 modules on different topics prepared by FPMT.  This distance program allows those who do not have access to a Tibetan Buddhist center, study this topic using audio teachings, readings and excellent email support by qualified teachers.",1181520000,38,510,4.964705882352941
2817934,5,B000PFT3OY,"This set from FPMT was well worth the modest investment. I found these teachings most helpful and inspiring with new treasures discovered with each watching. Comments by Richard Gere and Keanu Reeves were sincere observations and insights reflecting their own study and meditation and added to the teachings. I am still very much a beginner in Buddhism but, through some years of self-study, had gathered a few disconnected puzzle pieces regarding the Buddha's teachings on things like suffering, attachment, compassion, how my mind works, emptiness, etc. But I was having trouble fitting together what I had learned into a whole and with how to advance from study to practice. I just couldn't see the forest for being lost in the trees. These teachings came at just the right time and helped me start to fit many of those personal puzzle pieces together as well as adding insights on crucial missing ones. The teaching sequence parallels the Lam-Rim graded-path systematic approach attributed to Atisha and Lama Tsong Khapa. The topics covered include straight talk on tough subjects like death & rebirth, karma, samsara & nirvana, emptiness, bodhicitta, and how to transform our problems into a lighted path to our enlightenment. Watching the DVDs also has propelled me to embark on further home-study with Discovering Buddhism at Home, a 14-part study and meditation course from the FPMT Foundation Store. I find these DVD teachings by leading lamas and monastics, including His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, to be a most precious collection that I will surely watch again and again. I highly recommend the set as essential to anyone interested in studying Buddhism.",1180569600,89,1665,5.17037037037037
2817935,5,B000PFT3OY,"Being a person who has introspectively searched for the serenity of a calm, peaceful and loving mind, but had done so to mitigate the effects of a neurological issue (chronic pain), I had not expected to encounter Buddhism when I was presented several guiding events.  A book from H.H. Dalai Lama; an encounter with individuals who had practiced the path and other drivers led me to this DVD - I couldn't be more pleased with the presentation, the content and the message (esp the captioning) in the presentation.

The message in Discovering Buddhism is organized in a very accessible manner, starting with the foundation and through each ""lesson"" presenting views from Teachers, Students and others who communicate the message in many styles and methods.  The extraordinary message strikes the right balance (IMO) of hard truths and loving kindness through its delivery.  I feel that I'm on the verge of discovering something special in my walk - part of that foundation is this message.  I was reluctant to invest roughly double what a 2-DVD set would normally go for, but consider my investment to have already paid off and the monies go to a mission I can stand behind/with.",1308528000,,1178,4.929292929292929
2817936,5,B000PFT3OY,"This is a truly wonderful film. I have watched it many times and never tired of it.  What I liked best is that each section is taught by buddhist monks and lay people. This is also the film which prompted me to study buddhism more comprehensively.  If you have an interest in buddhism, the expense of this dvd is well worth it.  Enjoy!",1289952000,,335,4.285714285714286
2817937,3,B000PFT3OY,This is in essence a wonderful DVD set but it is not worth the price I paid for it.  The chapters are short and not in great depth.  A book would be better.,1246320000,8,156,3.696969696969697
2817938,4,B000PFT3OY,"Well designed and presented (2)disc DVD presentation on many aspects of Buddhism. Features many revered Buddhist monks teaching various lessons on fundamentals of the Buddhist tradition. Good value and will be an excellent learning tool and refresher for years to come. Initially I thought the product was a little overpriced, but after receiving it and watching most of it I have since changed my mind. Good value for your money.",1232409600,8,430,5.1571428571428575
2817939,5,B000PFT3OY,"Excellent source of information, very detailed, wonderful clips from various teachers.  Great for those looking into Buddhism for the first time, for those wanting to learn more...or to just debunk the myths that most people have about Buddhism.  Great for those who don't have teachers they can access nearby.  Am looking forward to continuing my studies with their (FPMT) separate module trainings that they offer on dvd.

2817940,5,B000PFT3OY,"How does one talk about the myriad of thought this DVD provides?

I at first was interested in how the Hollywood people presented themselves and what the knowledge was they were to impart.
Soon, as I realized the scope of the teachings was so encompassing nothing but that mattered.
Soon, as each chapter was complete, nothing mattered other than what was the next thought to absorb.
Coming from the Soto Zen discipline, that mattered not, as each chapter of thought was presented.

I'm attempting to impart the point that 'all that other stuff' matters not, once one is absorbed by the teachings.

This is an astounding assemblage of one view of Buddhism, as It encompances and explains  both sides (now).

Don't let my flawed view of reality distract you. This DVD is well worth the price.

If you want to learn what Buddhism encompasses, don't hesitate.",1229472000,5,856,4.828767123287672
2817941,4,B000PFT3OY,"This video..with intros from Richard Gere includes interviews with many tibetan buddhist teachers in many different countries and settings.

Discussion regarding Basic Tibetan principles takes place in relatively intimate settings, some during teachings at each teachers sangha.

For those seeking incite into the Tibetan realm, this is a great introduction to the dharma and each teacher's discussion can be accessed without having to navigate thru a heavy dvd chapter system.

Get on the Dharma!!!

2817942,4,B000PFT3OY,"While i mostly wanted to see Keanu riff on all things
on the path (he's on disk 2; Gere does disk one intro's)
i found the talks quite nice.

The one on death and your daily thinking had some
great stuff; i've read about HHDL's daily meditation on
his own death and the 9 meditations of the corpse,
but now can fit these into a context.

Many find the price modest; it's kind of expensive
for a 2 dvd set, considering that Doctor Who Season
one goes for $90 for six dvds.

And i would match a Sonic Screwdriver against
Karma and Dharma talks any day!

p.s. encourage your local library to purchase

2817943,5,B000PFT3OY,"This is a wonderful way to learn more about the concepts of Buddhism.  It is not trying to ""convert"" anyone, nor a ""how to"" course. It is a simple explanation of a gentle way of life. A professional film.",1204416000,14,204,4.230769230769231

8190961,5,B000PFT3OY,"Being relatively new in Buddhism, this video was easy to understand, and I loved the fact that you could go to specific topics instead of ""wading"" through everything to find the answer to an immediate question. Well done for the beginner. The advanced Buddhist may not find it useful.",1344124800,,284,4.816326530612245
8190962,5,B000PFT3OY,"I never imagined this 13 lectures would be so profound and understandable. In my opinion it is within all reacheable levels of understanting. It has 5 different subtitles including spanish, french and german.
It is a work to be seen again and at differents moments in order to gain reflection, practice and meditate in all those different areas. All interventions of Lamas and Rimpoches, including those of students and practicants are worth hearing. My all-time admiration for Richard Gere and Keanu Reeves whom very likely helped materialize this beautiful piece of artfor us!!",1340755200,,579,5.236559139784946
8190963,3,B000PFT3OY,"This DVD is good for as far as it takes me on the road to discover Buddhism.  For the price I was expecting more information.  However I did learn enough about Buddhism to know that it is far too detached and lonely for me.  I need people and emotional involvement and all the messy ""distractions"" of life. I'm not looking for contentment; I want joy!",1330128000,2,351,4.369230769230769

What I got was a series of wonderful, in-depth highly detailed explainations from highly skilled teachers who really know how to explain complex things in language that I understand right away. Direct, to the point, accurate, complete, like a lazer beam. Awesome, all of my questions were answered plus I was given answers to the questions that I would have been asking next.
