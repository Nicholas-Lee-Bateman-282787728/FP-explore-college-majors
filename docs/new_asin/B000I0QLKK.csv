8142702,3,B000I0QLKK,"Prime Evil, where do I begin. There's a funny period piece in the beginning involving satanism. Then we're in the present. This one's in New York City. Boy are people slutty there! Satanism has already got a jump start and you wouldn't think the villains would have much opposition. There's one tramp that actually says ""Don't you want to get poked?"", chiding her virginal girlfriend. Yep, that's life in the city for you. She does however provide some funny stuff and has a lot of life.
The movie is a good little peek into NYC at this period. The main chick is a knockout. The main baddie is an utter creep and it's not entirely convincing that the main chick starts to fall for him, but again we're in New York City so I guess anything goes. This is a very dark movie. The satanism becomes kind of overbearing after awhile. Still there are fun touches like the performance of a cop character who comes in to rain on the devilish party.

Brain Twisters is about technology gone wrong. Kinda cool concept here with some hints at social commentary. Again the main chick is very pretty. A Bill Pullman lookalike plays the male hero. He was kind of funny. Like in ""Prime Evil"" we get another amusing promiscuous character. My favorite thing about this one was the Doctor character. He's an interesting character and the performance is good. He likes the main chick.
