Seeing his Peacock Room on display in the Smithsonian was pure joy and to see it again here a delight!  Enjoyed that the famous law suit vs. art critic Ruskin was included.  Only they didn't add that years later, when Whistler's reputation had grown, he sold the offending picture for 800, about four times what Ruskin said it was not worth...from an article in The National Post in 2004 by Robert Fulford.",1450742400,,506,4.715909090909091

8662392,5,B00KX45684,"I saw this program on PBS. It is an in-depth chronological biography of James Abbot McNeill Whistler. We also get information on the time and place where he lived. We get information on his contemporaries. The presentation is packed with stills and film clips to support the narratives.

You will want to repeat viewing to the presentation as it moves too fast to think about what you are watching.

A good companion boot for the series:
