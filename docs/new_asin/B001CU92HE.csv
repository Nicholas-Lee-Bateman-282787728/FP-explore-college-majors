8290071,4,B001CU92HE,"This was an episode of the ""History Undercover"" series presented by Arthur Kent. This particular episode focuses on the advanced aircraft designs the Germans were working on as the end neared for the Luftwaffe.

The DVD begins with the HE-162 ""Volksjager"", a cheaply and quickly-made jet fighter. With a top speed of 559 mph, it would have been just as deadly to allied aircraft as the ME-262 - except with the numbers to compete with the far more numerous allied aircraft. The video looks at the BMW jet engines that would have powered it, it's armament of 30mm cannon as well as even more advanced designs featuring swept wings and forward-swept wings.

The video also shows a number of advanced or just plain odd-looking secret aircraft that never left the design stage. The TA-183 ""Hunchback"" jet fighter by Focke-Wulf could have fired wire-guided missiles at USAAF bombers. There is a nice overview of the Horten brothers and their fighter and bomber prototypes - the bomber version resting unseen in the basement of the Smithsonian until engineers from Northrop (makers of the B-2 Stealth bomber) visited it. There are a number of interesting aircraft in this DVD.

The episode ends with a hypothetical dropping of an atom bomb on New York by a Horten ""Amerika Bomber"" if the war had extended into 1946. Very unlikely, but interesting speculation. The CGI animation, use of period film, expert interviews and the color still artwork are quite good. This is a very good video on the German ""Wonder Weapons"" at the end of the war, but by no means comprehensive.

My only criticism of the DVD is that the price seems high for a 50-minute DVD-R. It is interesting and quite well made even at only 50 minutes and I recommend it with four stars.",1339804800,,1745,4.787375415282392
