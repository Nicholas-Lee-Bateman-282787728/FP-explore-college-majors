8559171,1,B00AYEUP48,"I have purchased this particuler DVD two times from Amazon and they were both defective. They paused, started and stopped throughout the programs. I shall not try again. Does anyone know where I could get a good copy? I'm afraid to buy any more DVD's in this series because of the defect problem.",1514678400,,296,4.60377358490566
8559172,5,B00AYEUP48,"Boris Karloff, in ""The Veil""-(which I have already), but mainly purchased for Betty Davis, and Charles Bronson, both in two different Classic television shows. I find the latter volumes the stories more interesting, this series will be one of my favorites! I'm really glad I discovered these, they are at a good price, though for packaging and space wise,-wonder why they didn't put more episodes and volumes packaged together?? As the earlier volumes are 1-8, (packaged together--still only 2 or 4 episodes on a single DVD)--I found under $20, some interesting, some quite dull, but Im learning RARE and VINTAGE Televsion and Movies, will be possibly rise in price--as those 1-8 volumes are NOW priced OVER $30!! Will not return as these shows are still better then anything on
Syndicated television today (IMO)--an some contain original advertising -a great find for the ""Vintage Tv/Film"" collector!
I'm wondering if..Turner Classics May issue a 100 best vintage film collection??
I do miss that channel very, very much!",1504396800,,1022,5.2
8559173,4,B00AYEUP48,Interesting collection of failed TV series starring big names.  I got it for the Bette Davis episode where she is a school teacher stranded in her little schoolhouse due to a winter storm.  Great to see her fine acting on the small screen.  All episodes are from the 50s.,1472688000,,271,4.489795918367347

8559176,5,B00AYEUP48,"Golden Age Of television Volume 9 is a fun DVD. With 4 individual stories it offers much entertainment at a budget price. Boris Karloff, Ann Dvorak, and Charles Bronson star in 3 of the episodes. They are all good. The great one and my favorite is Stranded from 1957 and the program Telephone Time. It stars the fine Bette Davis, as a teacher who protects her students in a blizzard. Edd Byrnes in an early role of his career, plays  radio announcer, Jerry Ferguson who brings help with  a snow plow to the teacher and children. This was the year before Edd got his breakout chance in 77 Sunset Strip. He became a teen idol as Kookie. A show you can watch and enjoy with anyone.",1435276800,2,678,4.373015873015873
