8195477,2,B000QCQ88K,I was looking for a video that contained some trippy images but this really wasn't what I had in mind.  It was trippy but seems a little past it's time.  Had alot of old computer generated animations that seems hokey by today's standards.,1324252800,,238,4.511627906976744
8195478,1,B000QCQ88K,"Save your money.  It's nice to look at for about 2 minutes, but after that, quite boring.  Of course, there is no music or any audio, and I would not have ordered it if I had noticed that.  Can't recommend this.",1314230400,,211,4.097560975609756
8195479,4,B000QCQ88K,"While not as exciting as the 3 Lux or X-Mix collection part 1, this DVD still delivers the dated looking early 90s rave visuals that I enjoy.  The draw back is that this DVD would sometimes freeze when loading on a DVD Rom drive.  It works fine on both Xboxes however.  Theres no DVD menu system, the Disc is designed to play and loop forever once loaded into a DVD player.",1296518400,,373,4.225352112676056
8195480,1,B000QCQ88K,"For something like this to work, it must be the highest quality image, full screen, and interesting to look at.  This was just junk.  I work in video, was trained in video arts when I went to art school, and can tell you that this video is without creativity, without imagination, and it is certainly bad art.  Basically, if you put your eye to a two dollar kaleidoscope, and turned it for an hour, this is exactly what you would see. If you can find a video called ""By Design"" by a company called Colorcalm,
you will see what a collection of great video artists are capable of doing.  This video has a series of gorgeous and subtle video 'chapters', each one like a beautiful moving abstract painting.  I've wanted to buy this for all my friends, but I can't seem to find even one other copy.  Meanwhile, save your money on this video.",1265414400,4,836,4.396103896103896
