8121844,5,B000FFJZKQ,"After all these years the Brooklyn Allstars still got it. Thomas Spann with that big bass voice and the harmonizing sound of the Allstars almost brought me to tears. It all took me back to the MET in Philly 1970 - 71. The replacement for Hardie Clifton is in fine voice. I am most pleased with this dvd. Again to the Brooklyn Allstars, thank you for many years of enjoyment.",1178928000,2,374,4.357142857142857
