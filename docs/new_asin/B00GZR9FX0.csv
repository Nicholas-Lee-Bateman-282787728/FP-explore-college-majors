6125128,1,B00GZR9FX0,"Don't buy this!
This edition brings the incomplete show! Only 1 hour time.
Absurd! A stupidity! The credits begin to appear in the middle of the show without any sense.
In this version all these tracks were cut: - La Apuesta; - Medley: No Me Enseaste/ T y Yo/ Entre el Mar y Una Estrella/ Piel Morena; - Amor A La Mexicana; - Medley: Seduccon/ A Quen Le Importa/ Arrasando.
Also missing the documentary.
Who wants to watch a show in half? This edition is nonsense! Shouldn't exist!
Don't spend your money with this.",1398297600,7,515,4.48936170212766

8628898,5,B00GZR9FX0,"Love this concert. Definitely Thalia at her best. Only disapointing thing about this blue-ray dvd is that it does not include the complete concert. A few songs were cut out in this edition.  The complete concert can be viewed on HBO LATINO whenever its included in its lineup, which seldom happens.",1483747200,,298,4.8431372549019605

8628905,3,B00GZR9FX0,I'm a huge Thalia fan but a bit disappointed with this concert because it seems very similar to the Primera Fila dvd. She still looks and sounds great.,1413244800,,151,4.428571428571429
8628906,1,B00GZR9FX0,"This is such a mess it's visually impossible to enjoy. It feels like it was edited by a crack addict. It's like a slide show There isn't a single shot that is from one camera for over 3 seconds. It zooms in,and out then pans the audience, then switches to the band then the singer then back to the audience....etc, it never stops! You can't get a feeling of being at the concert. It's pure aggravation to watch. Very disappointing,don't waste your money",1411084800,3,453,4.469879518072289
