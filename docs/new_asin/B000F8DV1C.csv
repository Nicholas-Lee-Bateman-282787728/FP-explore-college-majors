2554552,5,B000F8DV1C,"A Perfect Fit is a must have because it covers all ""movie territory"" (romance, drama, suspense) and ""real-life territory"" (love, excitment, questioning, etc).  It is dramatic without being false - Adrian Grenier and Leila Archieri are believable as a new couple and all that it brings.  This movie makes you think about relationships and just how powerful they can be.  This would make a terrific addition to anyones movie collection.",1149984000,4,434,5.171428571428572
2554553,5,B000F8DV1C,"Both main characters let you in on how they are feeling. You want so badly for them to find love. John seems innocent in love, but so tormented by his former life it destroys what he wants. You have to see it, I do not want to spoil it for you.",1149897600,3,244,3.803921568627451
2554554,5,B000F8DV1C,"What I liked so much about A Perfect Fit is that it made me feel so much.  The film is clearly a sad story about two people who desperately want to find the love that they feel will complete their lives.  Ultimately, it is a sad story, but along the way, there are some great laughs, some moments of suspense, and it is all done in a way that made me not want the movie to end.  The actors are beautiful to look at, and they seem like real people.  I haven't seen them act before, but I am going to look for them in the future.  This is a movie that I found myself thinking about long after it ended.",1149811200,2,600,3.925619834710744
2554555,5,B000F8DV1C,"Have you ever been in a relationship that ended badly?  Have you ever decided to overlook some of the icky things in a guy because he was charming and gorgeous, only to regret your decison later?  Have you ever been out of control in your relationships?  If so, then you should check out this film.

A Perfect Fit is a gem of a movie.  It tells the story of John (an excellent performance by the charismatic and gorgeous Adrian Grenier), who suffered tremendous abuse as a child, and is barely holding it together as an adult.  The audience can see that he's trouble, but Sarah (played by the gifted beauty Leila Arcieri) can't seem to see beyond his charming exterior.  She falls for him, even though there are plenty of warning signs (if you fault her for this, ask yourself if you've ever fallen for the wrong guy!).  As things get heavier, John starts to crack which leads to horrible consequences for him, for Sarah, and for the relationship.

I had to force my boyfriend to watch this film, because he didn't think he would like it.  But he loves Entourage and so I convinced him.  Well, he loved it too!  Adrian Grenier is so different in this movie than in Entourage.  It's great to see that he has a wide range of abilities and tremendous depth as an actor.  Leila Arcieri is great too ... my boyfriend is now obsessed with her.

A Perfect Fit will make you be more cautious when you are heading into a relationship.  Or, if you're like me, it will make you appreciate what you have.  Congratulations to the filmmakers for making an enjoyable film that, while it makes you uncomfortable, will ring true for a lot of women (and men) out there.",1149811200,3,1651,4.468227424749164

8118806,5,B000F8DV1C,"Ok this move was a great movie, I am so glad I have it in my Collection! As I could not imagine it without it!",1372809600,,110,3.44
8118807,2,B000F8DV1C,"As far as getting the movie here fast and in one piece they did awesome. The movie however, was lame. I give the movie a 1 star if that.",1316217600,,136,3.7241379310344827
8118808,5,B000F8DV1C,"I actually liked this movie. I thought both main characters of the film acted well and made their parts believable. I thought their chemistry together was hot too. The only critism I will say about this movie is that I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It's the type of ending that feels incomplete, and could've been done better.

Overall, the movie was good and had some ""thriller"" moments.",1272412800,,392,4.764705882352941
8118809,5,B000F8DV1C,"First time in my life I had to watch it twice. What a story! I could feel their pain, wow!",1245542400,,90,3.55
8118810,1,B000F8DV1C,"I just got through watching this movie. In my opinion, its preposterous that ANYONE gave this movie both 5 stars AND wrote a raving review about it. I am convinced the reviewers who did so are paid imposters. Why are so many from New York? Hmmm...

It was just plain horrible. Yes, Adrian is great to look at, and can twist up his face in subtle ways, and run down the street awkwardly like someone who is truly disturbed. He is good at those kind of things, but I suspect thats more natural for him than acting. If you like watching him do that a lot, then you'll love this flick.

However, for the most part, the movie is garbage. Its a good thing the cover explains whats going on, because without it, you wouldn't be able to figure out the whole paranoid conspiracy part of the plot. Its way too subtle. At no point do you have ANY idea what is going on in anyone's head. You have to rely entirely on the dialog and sudden, unexplainable scene changes. There are obvious 'memory' scenes, but you don't know who's head your in or what the point is. You're never sure whether a given scene is supposed to be a dream or not. Was the entire movie a dream? Is that the twist?

I still don't know what happened at the end of the movie. I was hoping to find an explanation here, but all I find is ""Perfect Movie!!! 5 stars!!!"" Sigh. So disappointing.

In conclusion, my I recommend that you wait for it to hit Redbox. It would be an ok movie on a boring Thursday night for $1. Don't buy it. Its not worth the shelf space.",1231977600,,1518,4.224137931034483
8118811,2,B000F8DV1C,"I guess I'm on the minority side here.  It was okay but we've all seen this one so many times.

Girl meets boy...boy is such a charm in the beginning...boy changes as time goes and turns out to be overbearing, controlling, and high tempered...boy apologizes and wants to reconcile...boy doesn't change...girl wants out...and boy doesn't take it very well...You get the picture?

There's more, but similar movies include:

Sleeping With the Enemy
Enough
Fear

BTW...Did anyone else think that Leila Arcieri looks alot like Vanessa Williams?",1196899200,,539,5.22093023255814
8118812,5,B000F8DV1C,"HE ALWAYS PLAYED A REBELLIOUS PUNK IN EVERY MOVIE I'VE SEEN,BUT THIS ONE, A VERY DISTURBED DISFUNCTIONAL GUY DUE TO THE PAST & FOR THE FACT HIS MOM GAVE HIM UP WHEN HE WAS 2,WAS THE COOLEST & FRESHEST ROLE ADRIAN EVER PLAYED!!!

I'M A BIG FAN OF HIS,& FOR THOSE WHO WONDER HOW HE LOOKS NAKED,THIS MOVIE IS YOUR CHANCE,SPECIALLY THE FETAL POSITION WHERE HE APPEARS ON BED WITH HIS GIRLFIREND!!

SSSSHH! I'M NOT SAYING MORE,FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO ANALYSE PSYCOLOGY SITUATIONS,THIS MOVIE IS A MUST,& FOR THOSE ADRIAN GRENIER FANS IS A PRIORITY!!!",1152489600,4,542,4.635416666666667
8118813,5,B000F8DV1C,"Like a good book that you can't put down, A Perfect Fit kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. The story is compelling and entertaining. The superb acting by Adrian Grenier and Leila Arcieri made me want to see how their relationship was going to develop, or not, at every turn. Suspenseful, thought provoking, tender, frightening... so much wrapped up in a PERFECT movie. A Perfect Fit is PERFECTLY directed blending PERFECT casting with a PERFECT screenply.

See it today!",1152144000,7,495,4.823529411764706
8118814,5,B000F8DV1C,"How refreshing!  I just loved the movie, and in particular it was really fun seeing Adrian Grenier in this role.  I religiously watch Entourage and Adrian is actually probably my least favorite character in the show.  It gave me a renewed respect for him to see the range that he actually has.  I think that I will enjoy him a bit more in the TV show now.  Back to A Perfect Fit, I think that this movie was paced very well, and I was never bored.  I often fall asleep when I watch a film at home, but I did not get the least bit tired during this one.  The story kept me interested throughout, and by the end, I was wired.  I used to work in a computer store, and I had a coworker who reminded me of that long haired kid who played the part of Ernie.  I thought that he was terrific, and I wished that I could have seen more of him in the movie.  Leila Arcieri was incredible as Sarah.  She could be the sexiest actress I have seen all year.  I found her to be very natural, and I believed that she lived such a picture perfect life with her parents, in that pastoral setting with the pool, that it would not occur to her that she could find herself caught in a web of romantic horror.  She was born to trust the ones that she loved.  LOL I am sounding like a shrink... I don't want to say much more, but see this movie, and if you like an extremely beautiful, sexy sweet hottie, by all means buy this movie.",1150416000,6,1409,4.03971119133574
