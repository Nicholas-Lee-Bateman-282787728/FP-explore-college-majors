8504261,4,B006TXDPEK,"This is a good well shot 3d blu ray for small kids. Adults can enjoy this safari show as well. I don't know where this aired originally , but since I collect 3d blu rays I had to have it. I would say that parents should grab this one , 3d fans can enjoy the native 3d as well.  It's informative and great for family viewing.",1395532800,2,324,3.909090909090909
8504262,4,B006TXDPEK,AWESOME 3D FOOTAGE!  MY KIDS REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE.  I TRULY RECOMMEND IT FOR THE KIDS AND FAMILY!  PROBABLY THE BEST 3D VALUE ON AMAZON!,1369958400,,140,4.52
8504263,1,B006TXDPEK,if you want to watch a couple of kids haming it up go ahead and get this. this is basically the same as the 2 safari 3ds with hunter ellis. same words-same scenes. put out by wild eyes productions. i think they made one movie and then copied it in two other ones so you would think they had made 3 different safari 3ds. i got this because i like the snimal 3ds but very disappointed by this. the kids get on my nerves as they talk so long. i gave this a star but it isn't even worth that. its just my opinion.,1345248000,,509,3.9038461538461537
8504264,5,B006TXDPEK,"My daughter got this as a birthday gift and loves it.  There's also a bonus 3D short, which is a nice addition.",1335139200,,111,4.045454545454546
8504265,5,B006TXDPEK,"My kids love this movie filled with amazing 3D footage of elephants, lions, cheetahs, giraffes, hippos and other animals!  The hosts are 2 of the kids from the movie: ""Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer"" (which they also love) and they do a good job teaching about the great variety of animal life in Africa.  Animal footage looks awesome!  Be sure to pick this up for your family or purchase as a gift for a friend :)",1333497600,,420,4.358974358974359
