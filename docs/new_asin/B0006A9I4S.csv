8040852,2,B0006A9I4S,"This movie is the worst of the Trois series, believe me.  The acting was second rate at best, the plot was weak and the main woman in the story pictured in the background on the box cover was cute but not all that appealing to me.

I've seen all of the Trois movies and each one up to the second one got better, but this one was a major bomb.  The story revolves around an up and coming rap artist who turns to becomming a male escort in order to pay off his debts.  He meets a woman who gets him established in the business, she runs his affairs, cares for him and becomes quite attached to him.  Soon, he learns that paying off his debts are the least of his problems.  He falls in love with one of his clients and things begin to fall apart from there.  The scenes had no spark to them and the actresses seemed to be trying too hard to be something that should come almost naturally.",1112054400,15,886,4.086705202312139
