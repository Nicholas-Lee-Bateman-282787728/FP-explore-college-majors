8485526,5,B005STRM8Q,"James Bridges who directed the CHINA SYNDROME, among other hit features, directed this one. A lot of young actors who went on with their own careers, Dennis Quaid, and Dennis Christopher, starred in the movie. Yes if you are still remembering James Dean, this will re-new some of your feelings after he died. Amazon just got it on DVD. The title is the date James Dean died.
I am leaving out a couple of the other main character stars who were also in the film. Buy it!",1357862400,2,469,4.402298850574713
8485527,5,B005STRM8Q,"Mid-Fifties in a small town in Arkansas.  Football and beauty pageants reign supreme.  Jimmy J.(Richard Thomas) though not necessarily a rebel is a bit of an iconoclast in the environment foisted upon him.  Word of the passing of his idol, actor James Dean, in a horrific automobile accident as an afterthought on the transistor radio.  Jimmy is beside himself.  Aside from his flaky friend Billie Jean (Lisa Blount) nobody can understand the depths of his grief.  This leads to a day of mischief, drunkeness, seances, and graveyard pranks.  Jimmy's friends(which include Tom Hulce and Dennis Quaid in early roles) indulge him but don't really understand.  Jimmy is going to have to go on this one alone.  This film must have been very personal to director-screenwriter James Bridges.  It's difficult to dramatize hero worship.  Even more difficult is dramatizing the death of a hero and the subsequent sense of loss their acolytes are experiencing.  The film is also abetted by a terrific performance by Thomas.  In an act of restraint Thomas charts expertly the stages of grief Jimmy J. is going through.  Two scenes stick out to me.  Jimmy's expression as he watches the final moments of ""East of Eden"" unspool.  Secondly, a scene towards the end where Jimmy relates to Billie Jean key plot points of the posthumously released ""Rebel Without A Cause"".  The final shot of the film that lingers on a movie theatre marquee is brilliant.",1330646400,6,1436,4.966386554621849
