6897970,5,B00R1OHT84,"A well done movie and beautifully directed. This was as good as the original IP man and I found myself watching attentively to see what would happen next. The story has a perfect beginning and when the Master leaves the temple where he has been for many years he realizes the world around him is corrupt, evil and petty. Naturally he is a virtuous man, but he will not allow injustice nor will he allow himself stand idly by and watch the innocent suffer which is what I liked about this movie. I have grown weary of such films where the innocent suffer, and suffer and suffer and even the heroes just watch others suffer and do nothing until the end. This is not such a film. The Master cannot tolerate injustice and as humble as he is he realizes the only way to defeat evil and corruption is with the combined effort of Mind and muscle; education and Physical force (Martial arts. The ending wasn't what I expected, but to tell you the truth I was relieved. I hate movies where evil triumphant and the good perish without a fight...This isn't that kind of movie thank goodness.",1441670400,7,1080,4.459595959595959

6897975,3,B00R1OHT84,Old school style martial arts film featuring but not about Choy Kay Fut. Good southern style fight scenes but the story is the same. Evil non Chinese exploited China and saved by traditional values kung fu. A must for any fan or practitioner of Choy Lay Fut.,1437177600,2,258,4.51063829787234
6897976,2,B00R1OHT84,"I don't like giving movies a low rating, but in this case, I think it's warranted.

The Master is a historical look at the Qing Dynasty, when China was overrun with corrupt officials, opium dens, and foreigners looking to profit off China. Chen Xiang is a student of martial arts and is not pleased with what his country has turned into. He attempts to make a difference by opening a martial arts school, where he can teach people to have pride in themselves and their country again. He also hopes to take back his land from greedy foreigners. The build up involves a power struggle between Chen and the local official. The plot also spends time giving us some commentary on the larger battle against the foreign presence. After a handful of minor events and some obvious attempts at nationalism, the film concludes. I won't spoil it for you.

First off, it's not totally fair to dig on The Master, if it was in fact trying to give a historical perspective on the troubles during the Qing Dynasty. These were real problems at the time, and the film was trying to shed some light on them. The only problem is, it's all been done before, and much better  I might add. The main issue with The Master is, it's not really an action flick, it's not a classic tale of a master teaching a student, nor is it a story of revenge. It's mostly a light take on a few historical figures, who had a mind to bring change to their country. But other than that, the kung fu is subpar to non-existent most of the time. There are no hi-octane scenes of martial arts to speak of. Nor is there a good tale that follows one particular character. It does however, attempt the feel of a classic kung fu flick, with the mask of a high budget, but it never hits the mark. In all truth, I'd say the biggest part of the budget for this movie must have gone to the music department. For a kung fu flick, the music was very melodramatic. In a few scenes I was thinking, enough with the music already, I get it, you want to showcase the score. But it's all done at the film's expense, to an almost corny level.

I did appreciate the fact that this film might appeal more to a Chinese audience, and it didn't translate over very well to a U.S. market. But it still doesn't excuse the overall attempt at making a film that gets botched in several areas. I'll give an example of what I mean.

At one point, there's supposed to be a competition against foreign fighters, where the Chinese have to allow a horse to kick them three times first, before they can fight. (Crazy, I know) But instead of showing that fight, we get a condensed version, where Chen basically kills the horse, then throws all the foreigners on their rear ends, barley lifting a finger while doing so. Even if that was a historical event, creative license should have made that one of the best scenes in the entire film. Instead, it's used to give a slight political commentary, ripping on the Germans and the idea of Imperialism in general. Interestingly the American fighter is spared the criticism, probably because the U.S. and China do a lot of trading these days. That's all fine and dandy, but I would have preferred to see the contest. Situations like that occur a lot in this film. For some reason, good spots where more action could have been incorporated, get cut short, or aren't shown at all. It might have been a budget issue, who knows.

In any case, the film is offered in Mandarin with English and Spanish subtitles. It also includes an English dub. The only other features are trailers of other films.

In the end I gave the film a 2. It doesn't have enough in the way of action or compelling storyline to rate it any higher than that. The background music seemed to be the area where the film was hoping to gain recognition, but its overdone at the film's expense. Overall this was a disappointment. Had it incorporated a little more action, it might have made a difference. But as is, The Master is not the next big kung fu hit, waiting to be discovered. It's more like a quick buck scheme, trying to earn dollars, in the various video rental markets. Watch only if you're extremely interested in it.",1430524800,3,4156,4.446194225721785
