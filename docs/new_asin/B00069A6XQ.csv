I CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
NEEDS TO RETURN TO TV",1387152000,,104,3.772727272727273
8040535,3,B00069A6XQ,"As a fellow Invader zim fan, I bought this product to add to my collection. But overall, I think if you were interested in buying episodes from the series because this is only the first episode. The DVD's are on various sites but go for some big $$$ so your best bet would be buying the episodes on Amazon Instant Video. But if your interested in collecting Zim merchandise, I would definitely buy this product!",1381276800,,411,4.493333333333333
8040536,2,B00069A6XQ,"I didn't read the product description and was disappointed when I received not the first DVD with 6 episodes plus extras, but a mini DVD with the first episode only. This first episode doesn't have the opening music and animation of the rest of the series - one of the things that I personally most wanted. I blame myself for being a lazy consumer - don't YOU be one!",1141084800,9,367,4.333333333333333
