8168799,1,6303535097,You'd think they would show more respect to the venerable National Football League.  This horrendous gift set features some of the the worst quality filming and scripting ever in a sports documentary.  These tapes in no way do the NFL any justice.  Many important plays in football history are bypassed.  This set seems to have been slapped together by some amateurs in their garage.  I'm going to have to throw the flag in and warn you to stay away from this encroachment.,990748800,7,473,4.719512195121951
