2798240,5,B000OONQ3A,"Such is the strength of this production that even a non-Puccini lover like myself found it riveting from beginning to end. The credit goes mostly to Catherine Malfitano as Tosca and to Byrn Terfel as Scarpia, although the directing, the sets, and even the costumes contribute mightily to the success of the production.

I love to hear Puccini arias performed in concert, but in his operas, I find the music in between to be rambling and unfocused; I also miss the ensemble pieces found in Mozart, the bel canto composers, and Verdi. I'm prepared to assume the fault is mine, but, nevertheless, it's how I react to Puccini. However, this production is so tightly crafted from beginning to end that I was caught up in both the drama and the music from the moment the curtain went up until the credits rolled.

Yes, the Cavaradossi of Richard Margison is just average. His voice is strong, but he doesn't bring much characterization to the role. However, because Tosca and Scarpia are the heart of the opera, I don't think this shortcoming warrants subtracting a star from the five I've given it.

Catherine Malfitano sings Tosca with that perfect combination of passion and control. She's also an exceptional actress - at turns vulnerable, jealous, fearless. You will be spellbound by her interpretation and execution of ""Vissi d'arte."" In performing it, she lays bare Tosca's life for us.

Bryn Terfel has such a firm handle on the character, that it's hard to believe this is his first time playing Scarpia. It's not easy to sing so beautifully while projecting such terror as a character, but Terfel does. He is truly frightening, while at the same time mesmerizing us with his full-bodied bass baritone voice.

The director, Nikolaus Lehnhoff has a vision of a decadent, fallen world and he carries it through in sets and costumes that are stark and rich at the same time.

Whether ""Tosca"" is one of your favorite operas or if you're still learning to appreciate it, I recommend this production most highly.",1196467200,10,2009,4.8425655976676385
2798241,4,B000OONQ3A,"This newly released DVD of TOSCA, which was shot in 1998 for posterity on the occasion of Bryn Terfel's role debut as Baron Scarpia, is one of the most visually stunning and musically pleasing productions of this particular opera that I have encountered in some time.

When discussing any performance of this opera, one must first assess the soprano who is singing the title character. In this case, it is Catherine Malfitano, the brilliant and acclaimed artist who was the Met's unofficial prima donna for many years. She is no stranger to the role--she's sung it probably close to a hundred times since debuting it in 1990--and possesses many wonderful quirks that make her interpretation fully singular. When this DVD was filmed (1998), Ms. Malfitano was still in her vocal and artistic prime, and she delivers a riveting account of the legendary diva. I dare any true opera lover to try to breathe during her radiant ""Vissi d'arte"", or her chilling murder of Scarpia. Unlike many notable sopranos of recent years, Ms. Malfitano is also a consummate actress, which makes her all the more watchable. This is really a star performance if ever there was one.

Likewise, Bryn Terfel is a bass-baritone whose distinctive voice and commanding presence has made him a favorite around the world since her came to prominence in the early nineties. Hearing him sing a role as iconic as Scarpia so well, it's hard for me to believe that this was the FIRST performance he ever gave of the part. He sounds like he has been singing it for years. (I felt the same way when I saw his first Don Giovanni years ago, as well). His sound is round, polished, and with the appropriate amount of menace that a great Scarpia should have. He's outfitted in this production to look almost like a sadomasochist (similarly, Malfitano looks like a really stylish dominatrix), but he doesn't need to crack the literal or proverbial whip. His Scarpia is terrifying enough as it is. Bravo.

The less said about the Cavaradossi of Richard Margison the better. I've seen this artist in a variety of roles over the years, and he approaches them all in exactly the same manner: sing loud, sing clearly, and never show any emotion. He plays Don Jose the same way he plays Manrico in TROVATORE and so forth, with absolutely no wavering. His interpretation of Cavaradossi is competent (he sings all of the notes), but never exciting. Watching him, I wanted to jump up and down and holler, ""This is one of the most thrilling roles ever written for a tenor. Do something, for Christ's sake!"" Give me Cura, Alagna or Giordani over him any day.

As usual, Riccardo Chailly conducts with style, grace and supreme beauty. Nikolaus Lehnhoff's production is out there (although compared to some recent outings I've seen in NYC, Chicago and LA, it's fairly tame) but enjoyable, sometimes simply because it is over the top. But honestly, the production doesn't really matter. I would watch Malfitano and Terfel sing this on a bare stage in street clothes. They really are that good.

Highly recommended.",1195603200,21,3057,4.826335877862595
8185907,1,B000OONQ3A,"Positive aspects:
- Terfel does well in the role, despite not possessing much of the grit that makes Scarpia work well.
- Certain aspects of the production's aestethic truly work, particularly in regards to the henchmen's costumes.
- Margison takes some time to get going, but his voice really fit well in the part.

Negative aspects:
- Useless recontextualization. Says nothing important about any time or place, when the original circumstances addressed a specific political situation in society. The 'death trap' motif fails to outlive the scripted scenario.
- Malifitano reaches the upper limit of age/voice for Tosca. Consistently drowned out by the orchestra, slow vibrato, and startling/neurotic eyes the entire performance. She should've sued whoever made her Act II costume.
- Margison looks like no one's ideal Cavaradossi, which combines poorly with his wooden acting style.",1510963200,,885,5.45985401459854
8185908,4,B000OONQ3A,"What a pity this is out of print. If it is reissued, I will revisit the topic at greater length. Suffice it to say that Catherine Malfitano's second video crack at Tosca is more theatrically persuasive and tonally blandishing than her bug-eyed assay in the Domingo/Mehta filmed-on-location version. Bryn Terfel's Scarpia is one of the great ones. Until Decca sees fit to reinstate this, go with a Renata Tebaldi performance, either her Stuttgart telecast with George London or her Tokyo one with Giangiacomo Guelfi (both on VAI).",1471478400,,529,5.091954022988506
8185909,5,B000OONQ3A,"Wow!  This is definitely a Tosca for our times.  Despite the Napoleonic references, the staging of the opera is more akin to something dreamed up by an Eastern European country's secret police in the 1960s or earlier.  Kafka would have immediately recognized this environment.  However, this modernity is what makes the performance all the more intense since it is easy to internalize.  As many have already noted, the singers are uniformly terrific.  Bryn Terfel is terrifyingly evil as Scarpia.  There is no banality of evil here.  Instead, the lighting and stage effects try to depict him as an Antichrist-like figure.  The 50-year-old Catherine Malfitano initially struck me as too old to play Tosca. However, once she started singing, age did not matter. She threw herself into the part and the result was an emotional roller-coaster of love, fear, rage, and betrayal.  Despite comments from some reviewers, I was very impressed by Richard Margison's Cavaradossi.  And the supporting cast just added to the atmospherics, especially Scarpia's henchmen who did demonstrate the banality ""just following orders.""  My only nit to the performance is that instead of a firing squad (granted a small one), I had expected single shot to the back of Cavardossi's head alla the NKVD and others of their ilk to further the staging's mileu.  All in all, this is a devastating performance with a true emotional wallop.  I most highly recommend it.",1304035200,,1438,5.115879828326181
8185910,4,B000OONQ3A,"Tosca, Madama Butterfly, La Bohme and Turandot are the best works of Puccini. You can ask and Manon Lescaut? I find it a little lower. Always preferred to Massenet's Manon. This, theatrically and vocally better built. That said, we have a version of Tosca in 1998 - when I bought I thought it was recent. It's hard to meet this opera soprano, a tenor and a baritone high level. In this version this was achieved thanks to Terfel, Malfitano and Margison.
The production scenarios chooses to modern luxury, where parade propellers and cats. Uniform design, which follows a direction busy, dynamic and even tiring for the singers. Costumes at times such as those of Tosca, sometimes strange, like Scarpia, too effeminate for a boss feared by all. All this, however, not characterized as Puccini: modernize it with a reading interesting and personal. Act I, scene wide open, second act, a propeller and a cat share the scene with a low ceiling, which want to transmit to the viewer? In the third act the scene is low, closed, claustrophobic. Inducing the end of Cavaradossi. Production and direction focused on reflection.
Vocally, the balance prevails, leveling the top. Malfitano was at its height, with his mature voice, dark, with acute generous. Tosca plays a neurotic, obsessed with love, jealous. Terfel is Wagnerian baritone stood out the treble. Lately, many baritones have followed this path. His beautiful tone and interpretation devil make him a great Scarpia, although sometimes a little effeminate. Never died in love with the tenor Richard Margison, but that show the man was in his day: people who watch opera live knows that his performance is never an equal to another. The man sang well, their sharp sprang naturally and control. His tone was pleasant and his reading of Cavaradossi correct, despite the enormous paunch.
The governing Chailly captures the details of the music of Puccini, but it makes a presentation routine. Without being interrupted by applause by the audience - they only appear at the end - can a bureaucratic musicality. It lacks passion, the explosion of Italian music in his reading.
The direction of image sometimes suffers at the plug, near the speed camera on the faces of performers, trick outmoded. The DVD contains 16 minutes of extras, no subtitles, showing interviews with actors and directors. When speaking in English, great, when they speak Dutch, complicated business. Someone understands Dutch ai gente?

Tosca, Madama Butterfly, La Bohme e Turandot so os melhores trabalhos de Puccini. Voc pode se perguntar:  e a Manon Lescaut?  Considero-a  um pouco inferior. Sempre preferi a Manon de Massenet. Esta,  teatralmente e vocalmente melhor construda. Dito isso , temos uma verso da Tosca de 1998 -  quando a comprei achei que era recente.  dificil reunir nessa pera um soprano, um tenor e um bartono de alto nvel . Na presente verso isso foi conseguido graas a Terfel, Malfitano e Margison.
 A produo opta por cenrios modernos, luxuosos,  onde desfilam hlices e gatos. Concepo uniforme, que segue uma direo movimentada, dinmica e at cansativa para os cantores. Figurinos s vezes interessantes como o de Tosca, s vezes estranho, como o de Scarpia, afeminado demais para um chefo temido por todos. Tudo isso, entretanto,  no descaracteriza a obra de Puccini: moderniza-a com uma leitura interessante e pessoal. Primeiro ato, cenrio amplo e aberto;  segundo ato,  uma hlice e um gato dividem a cena com um teto baixo, o que querem transmitir ao espectador? No terceiro ato o cenrio fica baixo, fechado, claustrofbico. Induzindo ao fim de Cavaradossi. Uma produo e direo voltada  reflexo.
Vocalmente,  o equilbrio predomina, nivelando por cima. Malfitano estava no auge,  com sua voz amadurecida, escura, com agudos generosos. Interpreta uma Tosca neurtica, obsecada de amor, ciumenta. Terfel  bartono wagneriano, sobressaem os agudos. Ultimamente,  muitos bartonos tem seguido esse caminho. Seu belo timbre e sua interpretao demonaca fazem dele um timo Scarpia, embora s vezes um pouco afeminado. Nunca morri de amores  pelo tenor  Richard Margison , mas nessa apresentao o homem estava no seu dia: quem assiste pera ao vivo sabe que nunca uma rcita  igual a outra. O homem cantou bem, seus agudos fluiam com naturalidade e controle. Seu timbre estava agradvel e sua leitura de Cavaradossi correta, apesar da enorme pana.
A regncia de Chailly capta os detalhes da msica de Puccini, mas faz uma apresentao de rotina. Sem ser interrompido pelas palmas da platia -  essas s aparecem no final -  consegue uma musicalidade  burocrtica. Falta a paixo, a exploso da msica italiana em sua leitura.
A direo de imagem s vezes peca nas tomadas, aproxima a cmera com velocidade no rosto dos intrpretes, truque antigo  e ultrapassado. O DVD contm 16 minutos de extras, sem legendas, mostrando entrevistas com protagonistas e diretores. Quando falam em ingls,  timo;  quando falam em holands,  o negcio complica. Algum entende holands ai gente?!
Tosca - Puccini

8185911,5,B000OONQ3A,"I just purchased the new Decca Tosca DVD from the Amsterdam production in 1998.  I watched it last night and I'm still haunted by it.  I like when that happens.

First off, Lehnhoff's production is going to seriously piss some people off but it is singularly one of themost exciting performances of Tosca I can recall seeing in years.  Lehnhoffhas taken Puccini's ""shabby little shocker"" and done what many of us have
been eternally waiting for - putting it over the top, right where it belongs.  He has stripped the tale of its ornate baroque trappings and set it in what appears to be hell.  For those who want read only about the musical performance - jump about half a dozen paragraphs.

Act 1's church is an enormous cavernous, foreboding place.  Cavarodossi's Magdalene painting absolutely gargantuan on a highly raised platform that dominates the rear of the stage.  Instead of rococo pillar and posts, the stage floor is filled with countless metal and glass columns a mite taller than your average man.  These columns provide incredible playing areas turning the enormous stage into a series of more intimate settings that work
magnificently.  During the Te Deum, Scarpia alone is on stage before a painting of the devil and at each cannon burst during this the tops of the columns erupt into flame - the cameras catching Scarpia's malevolent sneer, the flames leaping up towards him.  It is one of the most exciting images I've ever seen. And there were more of these to come.

Scarpia's apartment is of the industrial-strength variety.  A massively long two prong staircase dominates the rear stage wall the massive walls go seemingly all the way to the fly space of the opera house.  Stage right's wall is dominated by an enormous turbine which, along with the stairs charges the atmosphere with an ominous subterranean feeling.  This is not a fun place.  At curtain's rise Big Bad Scarpia is on an eight foot long divan, in tight  silk lounge pants with a lizard/snakeskin motif and matching sleeveless vest (my Mom had something similar in the 70's  . . . Hostess Pants).  He is stroking a beautiful yellow tabby.  Cool.

When Tosca first appears, all we see are her red high heels coming down the first staircase -  shoes she will remove before reclining on the divan for Scarpia to collect his prize.  Only after the murder do we realize the massive staircases have disappeared and we feel, along with Tosca completely trapped.  There are no other doors - the room converted into an enormous death trap, the only air seemingly coming from the turbine.  Tosca goes into a genuine panic during the dumb show - now stripped/relieved of the pseudo- religious crucifix/candelabra business.  In her search for the safe passage
conduct, Tosca discovers and takes a gun - almost hinting at suicide in her terror.  When a panel opens moonlight seems to stream in revealing a hidden exit.  With pistol in hand and tea-length fur coat dragging behind . . .  It is thrilling business.

The final act is on an enormous stage filling disc, the floor of which is covered by the shadow of light pouring down from the turbine - which is now in the ceiling.  The rear of the stage gives the feeling of being at the edge of the world - with the moon and stars reflecting in the night.  It's stunning and chilling all at once.

After the execution, the distraught, now fully deranged Tosca holds Scarpia's henchmen at bay waving the gun - and one almost senses she's going to blow her brains out . . . but instead she runs, flings it to the ground and takes a flying leap out the heavens that took my breath away - her hair wildly trailing behind her as Sciarrone and Spoletta hit the ground to safely watch her from
above.

I have read some startling bad reviews of this production, and I simply cannot fathom how anyone would not be wowed by it.  It is an absolutely chilling performance.

Now to the cast.  Malfitano is Tosca to the teeth.  Not your average Tosca, this one is neurotic and obsessive from her first appearance.  In the final act she is barefoot and costumed like a Martha Graham dancer.  Indeed, Malfitano never stops moving - her body, her hair all fluid movement - almost hallucinatory. It's a marvelous performance.  The down side is that the voice was never built for Tosca.  So much of the musical drama sits at either end of the range - really low lows, and pretty high highs.  At both ends Malfitano's instrument simply lacks body and beauty.  To her credit she insists on singing
every note, but the low ""chesty"" business that so many singers make thrilling, are here unlovely and growled and at times barely audible.  The less said about the inaccurate pitching at the top of the range the better.  Still MUCH of Tosca lies in the middle to middle high and here, Malfitano still possesses a voice of bright, unforced lyric beauty.  If this is going to bother you, you should skip it, but if you want a performance that is 75%  really good singing and 100% committed acting, Malfitano's your gal.  I loved her.

In Act II, I kept thinking Theda Bara had been reincarnated - Malfitano HAS to know this and have played on the similarities.  She looks terrific (some complain that even 10 years ago she looked too old for Tosca . . . nonsense). Her ""Vissi d'arte "" is exceptionally powerful - revealing more than a dozen other Tosca's combined.  Her Act III  performance is pure over-the-top, flitting and dancing and laughing - a mad scene, really and believe it or not, it works perfectly in this context.  I always thought Behrens had the best flying leap of any Tosca - but Cathy M. goes her one better  - it is and it's captured with breathtaking, horrifying beauty.

Richard Margison.  I've never been a big fan of the man, but having read so many negatives about his Cavaradossi I must admit to being pleasantly surprised.  He's involved and engaging, and I bought what he brought to the role.  Recondita Armonia is beautifully sung if a little inelegantly phrased at times.  The central act he rings out passionately.  Oddly ""E lucevan la stele"" is sung accurately, but with an odd tone that sounds more furious than forlorn. When Tosca arrives, Margison's Mario sounds much better, caressing the line and believable in the drama.  Yes, he's got a big gut . . . so what?  I was surprised at the depth of some of his acting here, and confused by those who
accuse him of just walking through the role.  Nope.

The night, of course belonged to Terfel in this, his first assumption of Scarpia. Some may not like him, but this is the Scarpia of my dreams in every way. Larger than life, Terfel's voice rings out with a liquidity one seldom hears in this role anymore.  There is a ""wetness"" to his sound that reminds me of Elisabeth Soderstrom (if you know what I mean).  Physically, Terfel exudes a creepy sensuality that feels almost x-rated.  Everything seems to revolve around sex, evil and cruelty.  The ending of the first act with the Te Deum sung so rapturously, flames licking up as this devil holds the stage by himself is a theatrical tour de force.  Poured into his lizard lounge pants he amps up the
carnality and when he stalks Tosca up the stairs I truly sensed danger as the hair rose on the back of my neck.  This Scarpia has everything planned and intricately ordered - seemingly controlling the very universe from his bunker- like world.  For a clue to his sense of order in this nightmare watch him polish a glass before he pours that ""vin d'espagna.""

The Welshman performs this role as though he were born to play it - and I think he was.  How exciting it is to see this different approach to one of opera's greatest roles and Terfel rises to the challenges imposed by Puccini and Lehnhoff, looking not just comfortable but entirely natural and believable every sick step of the way.

Riccardo Chailly has no less than the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra as the pit band and the score has rarely sounded this lush and symphonic.  Chailly brings out details frequently lost in other performances, his pacing is fluid and at times much slower than I am used to hearing in modern performances, but never indulgent.  The sound on the DVD is almost more ""studio"" than live performance and this is enhanced by the silence of the audience until the very end when they go properly mad.  So did I.

There is an interesting 17 minute behind the scenes documentary with some cast interviews and Lehnhoff and Chailly offering up their opinions.

I've heard the evil ""E"" word hurled at this production, and indeed some may find they simply cannot tolerate the changes of settings, but for anyone who can keep an open mind about these sorts of things - hang on tight 'cause you're in for a hair raising ride!

This gets FIVE stars because everything here truly adds up to a spectacular performance of Puccini's ultimate pot boiler!",1215993600,14,8859,4.645016077170418

8185913,2,B000OONQ3A,"I love Tosca and think Bryn Terfel is a wonderful singer-actor and so I bought this DVD despite the mixed reviews.  I should have listened to the reviewers.
I actually liked the set of this opera and the picture and sound quality were top-notch, as was the camera work.
So, what were the problems?  Well, Tosca and Cavaradossi!  Tosca was decently sung, but poorly acted and Malfitano was simply too old looking to pull off the part convincingly.  And, Cavaradossi?  Well, he was fatter than I am (picture Santa Claus...) and would not be considered handsome by anyone's standard.
Indeed, I kept trying to convince myself that overweight and ugly middle aged couples can have a wonderful passionate love story between them, but as my wife would say, ""didn't need that picture in my head"".
When I watch opera, I want believable acting, and part of that is casting.  If 10 had starred Estelle Getty instead of Bo Derek, somehow, I do not think it would have gone down as well.
The opera world seems to get the message, which explains why tickets to operas starring Anna Netrebko and Renee Fleming do well...
In any event, I do not consider this Tosca to be worth watching, let alone owning.  I did not listen to reviewers who said the same thing, but perhaps you will...",1201046400,5,1268,4.633928571428571
8185914,4,B000OONQ3A,"I don't know who wants opera to look like this. Nobody I know. Both the design and stage direction hit below the belt with this ragger. I wonder what Puccini would say? I've seen Malfitano's Butterfly and Salome in the opera house and those performances were better than this. This is vocal struggle, fortunately with tricks to survive it all. She's an adequate actor, but misses the idea that operatic 'acting' is more effective as it grows more hidden, more subsumed in the singing. 'Vissi d'arte' is fascinating; flashes of pungent beauty and an unsought sense of doom come across effectively. Her Tosca is wildly committed. If that's all you need, you might like the performance. Lamentably, vocal luxury isn't a consideration with Malfitano. Richard Margison's Cavaradossi is sterile, forgettable. But Bryn Terfel's Scarpia positively steals the night. Just the right amount of juice, and the right kind. A malevolent, bewitching Scarpia that sings like a seraphim! We've waited for this. Too bad the rest of the production is a clunker. I'd say skip it, and pray Terfel recommits the role as effectively in another production less self-involved - or better, live! But no regrets here. I popped for it expressly to experience Terfel's vocally voluptuous villain, and got recompensed in spades. He burns up the role, and the singing's beautiful. For all Scarpia's menace, the honey just pours out. Bryn Terfel, and the gorgeous sound of the Concertegebouw raises two stars to four!",1197936000,21,1485,5.090163934426229
8185915,3,B000OONQ3A,"When I saw it, my heart sank.  If you're reading this, you've seen it too: The picture of a screeeeaaaaaming Catherine Malfitano, Bryn Terfel lying sleeveless beneath her, and, looming over them, a large...airplane propellor.  Hmmm...Could this be another instance of the (Euro)trashing of a classic?  Actually no, thank goodness.  The production's pretty stylish and interesting; not traditional, by any means, but dramatic and visually arresting.  And that propellor?  It's not nearly as ridiculous as the sight of Malfitano and her Cavaradossi, Richard Margison, rolling around the floor together.  Honestly, I've never seen a more mismatched pair in my life, certainly not on the operatic stage.  They're like an artsy, aging Hippie couple in some small town in America -- you know the ones I mean, who run the ""art gallery"" in the mall, who embarrassingly think they're bringing a bit of Bohemia to the Bible Belt?  They're certainly not the type of Floria and Mario we're used to seeing.  And that would be OK if their characterizations were more in keeping with the actual libretto.  In my mind Tosca is regal and proud, passionate and strong.  Malfitano's neurotic and just downright crazy from her first entrance, a cross between Theda Bara at her most melodramatic and Mad Margaret from ""Ruddigore.""  And there couldn't be a tenor with less charisma than Margison; he's lumpish and lethargic, the male Jane Eaglen.  To be absolutely fair about it, both sound terrific, but there are plenty of other ""Tosca""s on DVD, sung as well -- or better -- with leads that are more the romantic ideal.

Terfel, on the other hand, is one of the best Scarpia's I've ever seen; perhaps in some ways the best.  The voice, of course, is magnificent, and what I love about the performance is that he barely breaks a sweat.  This is one cool cannoli, not the snarling, mustache-twister we've all seen one too many times -- and yet he remains a scary, menacing presence.  He's really the main reason to purchase this DVD.  But if he pops up in some other version one day (with Gheorghiu, please), I can't imagine coming back to this one.",1197158400,17,2127,4.874651810584958
8185916,1,B000OONQ3A,"My first complaint is to the quality of the video. I've never seen so many ""jaggies"" in my life on a DVD! ""Jaggies"" are what should appear as solid lines intestead appear as a step of stairs - an artifact that can be corrected by very good DVD players. Well the DVD player I have is one of the top ones and it has passed all the ""jaggies"" test, so the problem is not on the equipment. I also noticed that from afar (in Act 3) one of the singers eyes looked like a black spot. Decca has done a really bad mastering here.

The sound is good though.

Now the performance is another matter. Catherine Malfitano could not do justice to the role at the time the performance was made (1998). She sings with many voices (basically her lows, mids and highs are not well integrated) and tends to squaliness in the higher notes. Malfitano sings in a ""Sprechgesang"" most of the time which could be appropriate for a Kurt Weill opera but not here (legato for example is nowhere to be found and the wooble is evident). Acting wise she is ok but even at this time (9 years ago) looked a bit old for the part.

Richard Margison as Cavaradossi is predictably disappointing in the acting (he is a bit stiff on stage and of course looks nothing like a handsome painter), vocally he is somewhat uneven. In ""Recondita armonia"" (aria in first act) he lacks poetry and a sense on how to shape the lines; ""E luceven le stelle"" (the aria in Act 3) goes even worse, he is totally wooden here, not capable of shaping the lines again. But the voice is at least solid (Malfitano's is not).

Bryn Terfel (promoted in the cover as a sensation) is a major disappointment. Terfel sings Scarpia and this is a fantastic role which requires basically two things, a huge voice, great acting and a true command of the Italian language. Terfel meets the first two but fails miserably in the latter. The voice is big true but Terfel has a problem when the role goes high (and it does a bit in the ""Se la giurate fede debbo tradir...Gia mi dicon venal""), basically Terfel cannot go that high and starts to shout - Scarpia is usually sung by baritones and Terfel is a bass-baritone. But what is really not good is his interpretation, Terfel fails to portray the character, he just portrarys Scarpia as a burly thug and other singers (Ruggero Raimondi comes to mind) have found much more. Terfel also fails to enunciate the text and as sung here it seems cares nothing about it (which is unusual for him), just listen to the lack of subtlety when he sings ""...la Marchesa Attavanti, il suo stemma..."", this line is full of inflexions and Terfel sings it as if he was reading the NY phonebook.

Riccardo Chailly delivers a routing conducting, nothing bad but nothing good either, there is a lack of fire coming from the pit; he is too cool for a piece that requires passion (any Puccinian score requires that). The Concertgebouw Orchestra is marvelous though.

Nikolaus Lehnhoff's production is a total disappointment (and I usually like his productions, some/many do not). It can be summarized as the ""Tosca Turbine"" production. According to the leaflet (included in the box), Lehnhoff puts a big turbine propeller in Acts 2 and 3 to symbolize Scarpia's torture chambers. Well, the imagery failed me! The setting for Act I is more traditional, there is a huge paiting at the center and to the right and left a bunch of huge post lamps (for what purpose?), the set is very dark also. In Act 2, Lehnhoff has Scarpia caressing a cat (I won't even give his explanation since it is so absurd) and dressed in what to me looked like pijamas. Act 3 at least looked interesting (if not related to the libretto at all) and we have the novely of Tosca using a gun to scare off Sciarrone and Spoletta. The only thing I liked was the jump, Malfitano threw herself really good there!",1196467200,9,3826,4.497841726618705
