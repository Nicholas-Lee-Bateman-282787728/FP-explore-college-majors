1645147,4,B00005Q4EV,"No Mercy, like other PPV's from 2001, is one of the best from the Invasion feud between the WWF and The Alliance. The Austin and Angle rivalry continued here with the addition of argubably the greatest fan favorite superstar from the Alliance, RVD. This event also hosted a great Ladder Match for the IC Title and a classic bout for the WCW Title.

WCW Tag Team Championship
The Hardy Boyz vs. Lance Storm and Hurricane Helms
A very exciting opening contest. All four men did a fantastic job of getting the crowd into the match and putting on a solid match. Great opener. 4.5/5

Kane vs. Test
If anyone says that this match sucks then they just do not like ""big man"" matches. This match never gets boring. And it kept at a good pace all the way through. Kane did a good job in trying to put over Test here. A very good big guy vs. big guy match up. The beatdown to Nick Patrick after the match certainly added more as well. 4/5

First Ever Lingerie Match
Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler
I think the match type pretty much sums up this match. Both gals are hot and they both looked hot in this match. 2/5

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Edge vs. Christian
These two were made for this. Great weapon use and great spots involving the ladders and the chairs. Christian and Edge pulls out some maneuvers dealing with the ladders we haven't even seen yet up to this point. Just a fantastic and exciting match up. 5/5

WWF Tag Team Championship
The Dudley Boyz vs. Big Show and Tajiri
Good match but I think it slowed down the PPV a tad too bit. But still a good tag team title match nevertheless. The crowd was into it and the 3D at the end was what everybody were waiting for. 4/5

Undertaker vs. Booker T
This match just started as a brawl on the outside and continued as a brawl with very little wrestling happening. Undertaker really puts punishment on the arm of Booker. Just a fight with the ending happening before and a bunch of times after this. 4/5

WCW Heavyweight Championship
The Rock vs. Chris Jericho
I really recommend this match to all wrestling fans out there. I feel that this match is twice as better then their Vengeance and Royal Rumble bouts. This match delivered and a whole lot more with the hype behind it just phenomenal leading into the PPV. A great wrestling match. Stephanie interfering towards the end didn't hurt it one bit either. 5/5

WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kurt Angle vs. RVD
The Austin and Angle feud got a little bit more interesting here with RVD being put into the equation. And the RVD factor really played a significant role in the match. Was he with Austin or was he against him. We get the question answered very early in the match. Austin and Angle kept putting on a good match here as they did two months beforehand with RVD being the highlight reel with his high flying offense. Great triple threat match and this match also delivered as well. 5/5

No Mercy is a DVD/VHS I recommend in getting. One of the best PPV's from the Invasion period and just a solid PPV from top to bottom.",1234915200,,3065,4.43950177935943

wcw world tag team championship lance storm and the hurricane vs the hardy boyz great tag team match better than wwf titles and it was good and i was so suprised that jeff hardy tapped out before the hardys won the match and watch for it he taps out to the calgrey crab 4.5/5

test vs kane solid match but patick was bais to test to stay in character but the match was ok and pretty good all at the same time 3/5

lingerie match wrestlecrap

wwf intercontinental championship match edge vs christian really good ladder match but was slow at sometimes i thought it was really good in some spots but only ok in others although i am happy they disbanded so we could have this great match i would have liked to seen christian win to help him get a bigger push because edge at this point to me was getting pushed down my throat 4.75/5 not quite perfect

wwf tag team championship dudley boyz vs big show and tajiri really good again but still not perfect but tajiri and big show was a better team than i thought they would be and the dudleyz put on a real solid match suprise apperence by rhino 4/5

undertaker vs booker t ok match but not as good as some say and it is time filler but nothing special and they have both had better matches 3/5

now for the perfect parts

wcw championship rock vs chris jericho this was the best match of 2001 false finshes and all kinds of things that aren't in an average match it was such a great match no huge spots but just the best wrestling you can get back then 5/5

wwf championship steve austin vs rob van dam vs kurt angle wow this a great match also and is not overshawdowed by the best of 2001 because it is a different kind of match and is a great match of its kind and a little bit of a rush but is also one of the greatest three ways ever 5/5 and yes it would have been great to see rob van dam win the big one along with y2j",1216512000,,1943,4.0390625
1645149,4,B00005Q4EV,"This was at the time when WWE should have its greatest year. However, it failed miserably with this invasion angle. Still they could put on a great ppv with all the talent.

Hardyz VS Lance Storm and Hurricane: A excellent opening match. The ending ruined the match.

Kane VS Test: Two men I could really care less about. I will Test's big boot is vicious though. Nick Patrick continues his run as a crooked ref and Kane beats him up afterwards.

Side note: Kane has been with the WWE since late 97. I know he is the Undertaker's brother (in the storyline, not real life) but has this guy ever changed his moves? Well as of Feb. 2,2008 its been reported Kane has learned a few new moves. Its about time, he was getting very boring and stale.

Torrie VS Stacy Keibler: Stupid and pointless. Just wanted to show off some TNA is all for the men in the crowd.

Christian VS Edge: I hate Edge. Its too bad he is not down in Flordia instead of Christian. A good ladder match.

Dudleyz VS Tajiri & Big Show: A pretty good tag team match.

Undertaker VS Booker T: Didnt really care for this match.

Rock VS Chris Jericho: Two of the best showman WWE ever had. Too bad that Jericho is not living up to the hype nowadays. A excellent match.

Stone Cold VS RVD VS Kurt Angle: I liked the story behind the match. The match lived up to the hype, although it would have been nice to see RVD win the world title. It just was not in the cards for RVD. RVD is probably the best part of the whole match.

A great PPV with no really down side expect the Lingerie match.",1201910400,,1550,4.206081081081081
1645150,5,B00005Q4EV,"This event continued the WWF's hot streak of PPV events in 2001 while at the same time the Invasion angle was starting to pick up to an eventual conclusion. The main feud here was between Alliance Leader & WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin against Kurt Angle but this time, the most popular member of the Alliance Rob Van Dam was added into the equation. Also, WWF superstars were at each other's throats for the WCW Championship as Chris Jericho attempted to win the ""big one"" against The Rock.

WCW Tag Team Champions Hardy Boyz vs The Hurricane & Lance Storm. This was an exciting opener as everyone put on a great performance with Storm & Hurricane actually working well as a team with Lita, Ivory & Molly all getting involved in this match at one point or another.

Kane vs Test. This was during Test's best run of his career as this was a good ""big man vs big man"" contest with Nick Patrick getting involved with his biased officiating that became a factor in the match but pay close attention to the aftermath to show that this type of officiationg doesn't always go unpunished.

Lingerie Match: Torrie Wilson vs Stacy Keibler. This was the obvious T&A segment of the night. Nothing more past that.

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Christian vs Edge. This wasn't the best ladder match that they have done but it was still a strong showing between both men as they each dished out & took some sick bumps here with moments like Christian's reverse DDT off the ladder, Edge's ""edge-o-matic"" from the top of the ladder, Christian taking a fall that would have most men cringe & the loudest & highest ""con-chair-to"" that I have ever seen.

WWF Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs Tajiri & Big Show. Due to Spike being injured at the hands of the Dudleyz, Tajiri was the replacement in what was a good & watchable tag team match but nothing really memorable past that.

The Undertaker vs Booker T. After the feud with DDP, Taker needed a strong performance & he got that here against Booker T as these two actually had a very good match with both men brawling & Taker working on Booker's shoulder with various submission holds at one point.

WCW Champion The Rock vs Chris Jericho. This was their first & in my opinion their best match together. Awesome wrestling match here as Jericho shows that he was main event material that we fans have bragged about while Rock showed the more serious wrestling side that he doesn't show all that much with the crowd actually being split right down the middle as both men were actually faces during this time. With a sick table spot & a cameo from Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, this was the match that stole the show as Jericho finally won the ""Big One"" in the end.

WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Kurt Angle vs Rob Van Dam. A great main event as all three men worked well together with their different styles all coming into play as Austin was the physical brawler, Angle was the technical wrestler while RVD had the most unorthodox style. The bigger story was the appearance of Vince McMahon & ""who he really was cheering for"" that even brought out Shane McMahon that lead to a hilarious moment on the announce table.

In the end, this was the best edition of the No Mercy series as there was really not a bad match on the card & the main events certainly delivered along with a great ladder match. Overall, this event is worth going out of your way to see for the wrestling quality.",1191974400,,3441,4.555016181229774
1645151,4,B00005Q4EV,"Deep into the Invasion era, and past the initial shock and thought of WCW/ECW superstars invading the WWF, I felt there was a slag in the road, as the Unforgiven 2001 PPV was something of a disaster.  But the next month held an even greater venue I soon found out.

WCW Tag Team Championship
The Hardy Boys (C) vs Lance Storm and The Hurricane
Storm and Hurricane was an odd pairing in my opinion, though they worked very well together, and this was a high impact match that had classic Hardy Boys written all over it.  Very few slow points.  (9/10)

Kane vs Test
Two monsters pitted against each other, you expect power wrestling and the occasional brawling.  But when Test's only defining move is a big boot (which any random fit person could do) you can't expect much from him.  This match wasn't as much bad as it was just boring.  Test is not a great entertainer, and Kane had little to work with.  (4/10)

Lingerie Match
Torrie Wilson vs Stacey Kiebler
I don't even need to comment on these sort of matches, do I?  (0/10)

WWF Intercontinental Championship
Edge vs Christian (C)
For a ladder match, and for two amazing competitors like Edge and Christian, this one was surprisingly a dud.  There were some entertaining high points, but most of the match was empty punches and kicks, generic wrestling moves (like catapulting someone into the ropes) and overselling the effects of ladder combat.  There wasn't a minute in the match past the 10 minute mark that didn't see the two of them on their feet and in action without dropping and flopping around exhaustedly.  Not their best.  (6/10)

WWF Tag Team Championship
The Dudley Boyz (C) vs Tajiri and The Big Show
For me, this was one of those post-ECW moments where The Dudley Boyz prove they are one of the best tag teams in history.  This match was on, and the charisma and heel heat the Dudleys generated was awesome to behold, and the team of the monster Big Show and the athlete Tajiri was potent.  (8/10)

Undertaker vs Booker T
Little to look forward to here.  I agree with another reviewer in saying this was just a filler match.  Nothing surprised me or entertained me, it was generic wrestling at its best.  (5/10)

WCW Championship
The Rock (C) vs Chris Jericho
It's these sort of matches that made the WWF the best major wrestling promotion of its time.  The Rock is not a great wrestler athletically, but he is highly flexible, can do some moves, and has an electrifying charisma in and out of the ring which more than makes up for his flaws, even among his detractors.  This sort of energy is painfully missing in the WWE these days with the likes of John Cena taking his place as the fan favorite.  Both Jericho and The Rock were fan favorites in this one, and their bout was full of energy from the competitors and the audience.  There wasn't a silent or slow moment in the entire match.  (10/10)

WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin (C) vs Kurt Angle vs Rob Van Dam
With the disappointment of the previous event's main event, I wasn't expecting much better from this one.  The three fused highly well with their conflicting styles, and while it wasn't as good as the WCW Championship match, it turned out a classic WWF Attitude era main event, and would be one of the last.  (9/10)

All in all, this was one of the better WWF PPVs I've seen, and puts most all the current WWE PPVs to shame.",1187049600,,3369,4.515702479338843

Rating: 9.5/10

Yet the best match of the night wasn't the main event, the ladder match is the best match of the night. Better than to remove the WWF Tag Team Championship match coz it sucks. 2nd best PPV of 2001 after WrestleMania followed by No Way Out.

This Review is Very long so go to ""see all my reviews"" and look for it to see the full review !!!

1. WCW Tag Team Championship

 Hardy Boyz vs. Hurricane Helms and Lance Storm

No Mercy kicked off from the Savvis Center in St. Louis with WCW Tag Team Championship action, as the Hardy Boyz defended against The Hurricane and Lance Storm. The Hardys were accompanied to the ring by Lita, while Hurricane & Storm were accompanied by Mighty Molly and Ivory. Hurricane showed off some of his Hurri-powers as the match began, but the Hardys battled right back with their high-flying, double-teaming tactics. But Hurricane & Storm roared right back with some double-team tactics of their own. Soon Hurricane put on his cape and leapt from the top rope all the way to the outside, taking out his opposition! The challengers isolated Jeff Hardy, but Jeff soon battled back, nailing Lance with a breath-taking corkscrew moonsault. Moments later, he tagged Matt, who cleaned house. Soon it was an all-out brawl in the ring, with several near falls. Matt went for the Twist of Fate, and the challengers hit a double thrust kick, but Jeff saved his brother from the pin at the last second. Lita got involved soon after, getting into it with Ivory and Mighty Molly. Jeff then hit Ivory, and Lance Storm snuck up on Jeff to get the half Crab. But Lita hit Lance with a hurricanrana. Matt then hit a Twist of Fate on Hurricane, and Jeff hit the Swanton Bomb for the win!

Winners and still Champions: Hardy Boyz

2. Kane vs Test

Two of the biggest, baddest dudes in sports entertainment went at it when Test battled Kane. The match marked Kane's fourth anniversary in the Federation, as he made his debut at the October 1997 ""Badd Blood"" Pay-Per-View, right in St. Louis! Test went for his flying elbow, but Kane moved just in time and came back with a neckbreaker. Kane then drove Test down with a suplex, but Test just got the shoulder up at the last minute. A Kane clothesline sent Test over the top rope, but Test recovered to ram Kane into the ring post and hit him with a big boot to the face! Once back in the ring, Kane narrowly escaped defeat. Test measured for another boot to the face, but Kane caught him in a chokeslam! The two then traded blows until Kane caught Test in a powerslam. Kane then ascended the top rope but missed a flying clothesline! Amazingly, Test caught the 300-plus pound Kane in a pump-handle slam, but Test again narrowly avoided defeat! Test then went to the outside to grab a chair, but Kane hit a dropkick against the chair and into Test's face! When Kane went to use the chair, referee Nick Patrick grabbed the chair and took it away! Patrick's interference opened the door for Test to finish the Big Red Machine with a big boot to pick up the win! After the match, an angry Kane chokeslammed Patrick not once, but twice, and then sent Patrick down with a powerbomb!

Winner: Test

3. First Ever Lingerie Match

 Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler

The two sultry divas strutted down to the ring, ready to show off their stuff. Torrie unveiled her lingerie first, a mouth-watering red number. Stacy was slower to disrobe, instead stunning the crowd with some spins and kicks. Stacy then took off her robe to reveal a stunning black number, before slapping Torrie across the face. She then took out a whip, and whipped both Torrie and the referee! From there, the catfight was on, and the two women even rolled right over the ref! The women traded several near falls and then Torrie hit Tajiri's handspring elbow to score the pin, spanking Stacy after the bout!

Winner: Torrie Wilson

4. Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match

 Christian vs. Edge

Two years after Edge & Christian battled the Hardy Boyz in the Ladder Match that put both teams on the map, E&C met up one-on-one in a Ladder Match for Christian's Intercontinental Championship, as it was brother vs. brother! With the title hanging above the ring, the fight started on the ramp way. It didn't take long for the ladder to become a factor, and the two brothers even battled into the crowd. Edge took the early advantage, catapulting his brother into the ladder, but Christian battled back, dropping his brother onto it. With the ladder propped up between the ring and the barricade, the brothers battled it out on top, and Christian fell crotch-first onto one of the rungs! Edge tried to bring the battle into the ring, but a Christian dropkick knocked the ladder right into Edge's face! That allowed the IC Champion to set up the ladder and try and get his belt. But Edge knocked him from the ladder, and Christian clotheslined Edge in the process. Christian then trapped Edge in the corner with the ladder, as the ""Christian sucks!"" chants began. Christian got a steel chair and went to nail his brother, but Edge caught his brother and tossed him from the top rope onto the ladder, spine-first! Edge set the ladder up against the ropes and put his brother on his shoulders. He then tossed him off, and Christian landed on the ladder in a precarious position! Edge set up the ladder between the top two turnbuckles, but Christian reversed a whip, sending his brother into the ladder! Moments later, Christian slingshotted his brother right into the ladder! Christian brought another ladder into the ring and set it up, as Edge started to come to. Edge then set up the other ladder and slammed Christian from the top of both ladders, with both men putting their bodies on the line! Edge was the first to come to, and he ascended one of the ladders as the fans cheered for him. Christian attacked his brother from behind, and hit the I'm Prettier from the top of the ladder! Christian went to the outside and got a pair of steel chairs. He set his brother up for the one-man con-chair-to, but Edge knocked the chair back into Christian's face. Edge then went outside the ring and brought in a third ladder, propping it up on the two chairs. He set Christian up on the ladder, and then went to the top rope and splashed his brother with a thunderous crash! Edge started to climb for the title, but Christian used a ladder to the ribs to knock Edge from the ladder. Christian then propped up the third ladder behind the other two. Christian started climbing a ladder, and Edge went up to the top rope and speared Christian right off the ladder! The brothers then began to climb the same ladder at the same time, and as they ducked it out, their ladder fell to the outside of the ring, knocking both brothers to the floor! E&C were very slow in getting to their feet, and Christian got back into the ring first. He started to climb, but fell a few times, and he was clearly very sore. Soon Edge was back in the ring, and he hit Christian with a chair below the belt. Edge then manoeuvred the chairs and gave Christian a con-chair-to on the top of the ladders! Christian's prone body rolled off the ladders, as Edge grabbed the title and became the new Intercontinental Champion!

Winner and new Champion: Edge

5. WWF Tag Team Championship

 Dudley Boyz vs. Big Show and Tajiri

After putting Torrie Wilson and Spike Dudley through tables, the Dudley Boyz were wanted men in their title defence against Big Show and Tajiri. The Dudleys tried to isolate the Show, but the big man used his power advantage to gain control. Tajiri used his kicks in an attempt to score the Tag Titles, but Bubba soon nailed Tajiri with a Bubba Bomb. The Dudleys tried double-teaming Tajiri to soften up the smaller member of their challengers. Finally, Tajiri got the tag to Big Show, who dominated the Dudleys. The Show did his best Razor Ramon impression, and then signalled for the chokeslam, but the Dudleys knocked him out of the ring. Tajiri knocked the Dudleys down with kicks, and soon locked D-Von in the Tarantula. Moments later, he knocked the Dudleys down with a double handspring elbow! Tajiri went to hit Bubba with the mist, but instead hit the ref. Big Show then chokeslammed Bubba, but the ref was still out of it. Rhyno then ran to the ring and gored the Big Show to the outside. Tajiri then scored an enziguiri and a big kick to the face on D-Von, who barely kicked out of the pinfall. Moments later, the Dudleys hit the 3-D, and pinned Tajiri for the successful title defence.

Winners and still champions: Dudley Boyz

6. Undertaker vs. Booker T.

The most respected superstar in World Wrestling Federation history battled the most decorated superstar in WCW history as the Undertaker took on Booker T. The match started outside the ring with punches and kicks, as the two icons went at it. Taker went to work on Booker's left arm, and soon went old-school on Booker. Booker soon regained the advantage, as the fight spilled to the outside. Booker tried to hit Taker with the ring bell, but referee Tim White stopped him from doing so, and Taker regained the advantage as the fight spilled into the crowd. But Booker battled back as the fight went back into the ring. Booker went up top and nailed Taker with a missile dropkick. Soon after, he hit Taker with a big kick to the face, and a side suplex. Booker then telegraphed a knee to the face, and was about to go for the Spinerooni, until Taker got back to his feet. Taker rallied back with a big boot, but Booker reversed a powerslam and scored a near fall. Booker went to the second rope but was met with a big foot, and the two men slugged it out. A spinning heel kick by Booker was good for two, but Taker hit a DDT soon after. The fight continued, and Taker measured Booker for an avalanche. But Booker caught him, dropped him on the turnbuckle, and hit a kick, knocking Taker to the outside. Booker then hit the Spinerooni! As Taker went to get back in the ring, Booker hit him with a scissors kick, but Taker got his foot on the bottom rope. Moments later, Taker went for the chokeslam, but Booker powered out of it with a low blow, undetected by the ref. Booker punched Taker on the turnbuckles, but Taker nailed Booker with the Last Ride and pinned him to win the match.

Winner: Undertaker

7. WCW Heavyweight Championship

 The Rock vs. Chris Jericho

It was the biggest match of Chris Jericho's career, as Y2J challenged The Rock for the WCW Championship, looking to prove that he could indeed win the ""big match."" Rock -- who lost the Federation Championship last year at No Mercy -- was looking to defeat his motivated challenger. The two popular superstars laid into each other from the get-go, as the fans were clearly split in who to cheer for. Rock looked for the Rock Bottom early on, but Y2J powered out and went for the Walls of Jericho, but Rocky got to the ropes. Y2J then hit Rock with the second-rope dropkick, pulling out all the stops for this unique opportunity to snare WCW gold. He also hit Rock with a top-rope reverse elbow for a two-count. Y2J also scored a near-fall after a flying forearm. Y2J gained the advantage, and assaulted Rock with various manoeuvres, trying to wear down the People's Champion. Rock roared back with a clothesline, but Jericho hung Rock out to dry on the top rope moments later. After a bodyslam, Jericho went up top, but Rock caught him and crotched him on the top rope, and then superplexed him down! The men slugged it out, and Rock tossed Jericho down, and then nailed Y2J with a Samoan drop for a two-count. Running on adrenaline, Rock knocked Jericho over the top rope to the outside. On the outside, he knocked Y2J's head off the announce table, before tossing him back into the ring. Rocky continued to pound on The Rock, but Jericho battled back. Rock floored Y2J with a clothesline, but Jericho kicked out of the pin. Moments later, Rock tossed Jericho to the outside. Back on the inside, Rock scored another near-fall. Rock then tried to wear down Y2J with a sleeper. After battling out of the sleeper, Y2J went for a dropkick but missed. Rock hit Jericho with a slingshot into the top turnbuckle, and then hit a clothesline. Rock continued to dominate, and went for another top-rope superplex. But Jericho pushed Rock down, and hit Rock with a missile dropkick! Both men were slow to get back to their feet, and when they did, they slugged it out. Y2J scored with a neckbreaker and a hurricanrana for two. Moments later, Jericho hit Rock with a Rock Bottom! He then nailed a Lionsault, but Rock kicked out at two, much to Y2J's shock! Y2J then hit a bulldog on The Rock, and went for the People's Elbow, but Rock moved! Rock battled back, putting Y2J in the sharpshooter! Jericho screamed for dear life, and after what seemed like minutes, Y2J finally made it to the ropes, forcing Rock to break the hold! On the outside, Rock took the top off the Spanish announce table, and he and Jericho ascended the table. He then nailed Y2J with a Rock Bottom right through the table! Rock stared down his challenger, and brought him back into the ring. He set Y2J up for a Rock Bottom, but Jericho battled out of it. Rock then hit a spinebuster on Y2J, and went for a People's Elbow of his own. But as he was about to hit it, Jericho caught Rock's foot, and locked Rock in the Walls of Jericho! Rock reached for the ropes for all he was worth, but as he was about to get there, Jericho pulled him away! Suddenly, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley ran to the ring and threw a chair in the ring, Y2J let go of the hold to knock Stephanie from the apron, and when Y2J turned around, Rock nailed him with a DDT. Rock then threw Stephanie into the ring, and hit her with a Rock Bottom! The distracted ref didn't see Y2J knock Rock's head into the chair! Three seconds later, Chris Jericho was the new WCW Champion! After the bout, Y2J mocked Stephanie. Rock grabbed a chair and snuck up behind Y2J. When Jericho turned around, Rock presented him with the chair, and Jericho held up the title belt and the chair!

Winner and new Champion: Chris Jericho

8. WWF Heavyweight Championship

 Steve Austin vs. Kurt Angle vs. Rob Van Dam

This match was made all-the-more interesting by the fact that Commissioner Mick Foley made it a no-disqualification bout on HEAT, and also by the fact that there were many question as to what role Vince McMahon would play. Austin had some words for RVD prior to the bout, as Angle snuck up and nailed both men with suplexes. Austin & RVD soon battled back and double-teamed the Olympian. They knocked him from the ring, and Austin talked some trash to RVD, even giving him the middle finger. RVD gave it right back, as Angle snuck up behind RVD and attacked him. The Rattlesnake pounded on both men, even hitting Angle with a low blow. He went for the Stunner on Angle, who reversed it into an ankle lock before RVD kicked Angle, breaking the hold. RVD nailed Austin with a series of kicks, before Angle attacked RVD from behind. But RVD hit Angle with Rolling Thunder for a near-fall, broken up by Austin. As the ""RVD"" chants heated up, Austin hit RVD with a spinebuster, threw Angle to the outside, and gained a near-fall on RVD. Austin went to work on RVD's knees, and also pounded on Kurt. Stone Cold locked RVD in a half Boston Crab, until Angle broke it up. Austin threw Angle to the outside and locked RVD in a STF, until Angle broke that up too. Outside the ring, Austin slingshotted Angle into the ringpost, and then wrapped RVD's legs on the ringpost. With Angle and Austin down, RVD went up top. He went for the Five-Star Frog Splash, but both men moved out of the way. Moments later, Austin hit the Stunner on Angle, but RVD broke up the pin. RVD set Austin up in the corner, and hit the split-legged moonsault for two. Angle hit the Angle slam on RVD, but Austin broke up the pin. Austin knocked Angle from the ring, and then Stone Cold went outside the ring after him. Austin and Angle ducked it out on the outside, and Stone Cold took the top off the other announce table. He went to piledrive Angle, but Angle backdropped him onto the announce table, which did not break! RVD then scored with a leap to the outside on Angle, as all three men lay on the outside! Suddenly, Vince McMahon strutted to ringside. RVD & Angle were the first two men up, and they slugged it out inside the ring, where RVD hit Angle with a reverse heel kick. RVD then went up top, but Angle caught him with a top-rope belly-to-belly suplex! Austin finally got back into the ring, and hit another Stunner on Angle, but Angle fell outside the ring, so the Rattlesnake turned his attention to RVD. Mr. McMahon then got in the ring and nailed Austin in the back with a steel chair! RVD went up top and nailed Austin with the Five-Star Frog Splash, but an injured RVD couldn't go for the pin right away. When he finally did, Angle broke it up. Angle hit RVD with four belly-to-back suplexes and an Angle slam, but as he went for the pin, Shane McMahon ran down and threw Angle to the outside and into the ringpost! Shane and Vince then started going at it! Back in the ring, Austin hit the Stunner on RVD and pinned him to retain his championship, much to Vince McMahon's shock!

1645165,5,B00005Q4EV,"No Mercy 2001 had so many great matches that it wasn't easy to give this less than 5 stars. The main event was worth the price of this alone. But the card was solid enough to push this to a five star rating.

WCW Tag Team Championship Match

The Hardy Boyz [Champions] vs. Lance Storm and The Hurricane:

This was a high flying, fast paced match. Both teams were accompanied by ladies as the Hardy Boyz had Lita and Lance Storm and The Hurricane had Molly Holly and Ivory. The Hardy Boyz win after Jeff uses the Swanton Bomb. 8/10

Kane vs. Test:

This was a big man match, as both men used giant kicks to the face all throughout the match. Test tries to use a chair but Kane kicked it right in his face. The WCW ref distracts Kane long enough for Test to get the win. 7/10 [After the match the ref gets his a** handed to him by Kane]

First Ever Lingere Match

Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler:

This was for the male viewers, and being one myself i didn't complain. I will say that the wrestling was absolutely horrid though. 3/10 [Just for the outfits]

Intercontinental Championship

Ladder Match

Christian [Champion] vs. Edge:

This ladder match still stands as one of the best one on one ladder matches to this day. Too many spots to name, but one painful one was when Edge jumped off a ladder on top of Christian who was on a ladder. Numerous chair shots by both men but Edge wins after giving the Con-Chair-To to Christian. 10/10

WWF Tag Team Championship Match

Dudley Boyz [Champions] vs. Big Show and Tajiri

The Dudley Boyz main target during this match was Tajiri as Big Show kicked their a**es everytime he was tagged in. Tajiri accidently hit the ref with the green mist. Then Rhyno comes down and gores Big Show. The Dudley Boyz win after giving Tajiri the 3D. 8/10 Good match

Undertaker vs. Booker T:

Not much to say, its just like their match at Judgment Day 2004 but the excitment from the crowd was much better. Back and forth action and the Undertaker wins with the Last Ride Powerbomb. 7/10, [okay match, just a card filler my opinion.]

WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match

The Rock [Champion] vs. Chris Jericho:

This was the best of the three times these two have gone one on one with each other. Jericho gets Rock Bottomed through a table during the match, then Stephanie comes down and gets Rock Bottomed as well. Jericho wins thanks to a steel chair. 9/10 excitment all the way through.

WWF World Heavyweight Championship

No Disqualification

Stone Cold Steve Austin [Champion] vs. Kurt Angle and RVD:

Three unique stlyes met in a triple threat match for Austins championship. The action was fast paced and all three men broke up three counts at various times. Not much weapons were used but Angle did backdrop Austin on an announce table but the table didn't break.

Mr. McMahon came to the ring and used a chair on Austin. Shane McMahon made his presence known and attacked Vince. Austin wins after giving the stunner to Rob Van Dam. 10/10 [Greatest main event in the history of No Mercy.]

No Mercy 2001 was one of the best ppvs that year had near its end. To think that now we have to deal with guys like Heidenreich and stupid car crashes. [Just watch No Mercy 2004 to see what I mean]",1113696000,4,3229,4.476923076923077

Great match!  This is when tag matches were returning to solid favor with the fans.  All 4 do a great job.

Kane vs. Test

Well, I was surprised to see that this turned out to be a good big man match.  A lot of false finishes and lots of big moves.

Lingerie Match

Stacy Kiebler vs. Torrie Wilson

they're hot but ugh...skidmark on the underwear of the wwf.

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship

Christian vs. Edge

Better than it's been given credit for.  It isn't what we expected but it's still a decent match with a good finish.

WWF Tag Team Championship

Dudley Boyz vs. Big Show & Tajiri

Another welcome surprise!  An excellent and unorthodox type of tag match.

Undertaker vs. Booker T

First meeting ever for these two and it's a good one.  Good pseudo-main event.

WCW Championship

The Rock vs. Chris Jericho

A classic!  A masterpiece even!  Everything about this match was perfect.  The feud, the move sets, you name it.  Top 10 match of the year.

Triple-Threat Match for the WWF Championship

Hardy Boyz (Champions) V. Lance Storm & The Hurricane
Pretty good tag team match with some high-flying action. Hardys retain. ***

Kane V. Test
Pretty good Big Man match. Test wins. Someone rated this a four star match, I won't rate it that high, but it's close. ***1/2

Lingerie Match:
Stacy V. Torrie
Why put this on a Pay-Per-View? Oh yeah, to get more buyrates. Torrie wins and who cares. 1/2*

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:
Christian (Champion) V. Edge
This match was not that good at all. It was long and boring. There was really nothing that Edge & Christian did that they haven't done before in other Ladder Matches. Edge wins the title in probably the worst singles ladder match ever. **

WWF Tag Team Championship:
The Dudley Boyz (Champions) V. Big Show & Tajiri
Great match. This is not just a typical match. This was refreshing after watching the underwhelming ladder match. The Dudleyz retain. ***1/2

The Undertaker V. Booker T.
Pretty great match with Taker winning. ***3/4

Another awesome Championship match. Great Triple Threat Action with Austin retaining the WWF Title. ****1/2

Overall, a surprising awesome show. Both Tag Team Title matches were great, both World Title matches were awesome. The Rock, Jericho, Austin, Angle, & RVD gave it everything they had. The Kane/Test and Taker/Booker matches were surprising solid. The only two bad matches were the women's match and the very disappointing ladder match.",1094860800,,1844,5.0394736842105265

1. Hardy Boys vs. Lance Storm & The Hurricane (WCW Tag Titles)

Good way to kick of the PPV.  Very entertaining, fast paced, hard hitting match.  (8.5/10)

2. Test vs. Kane

These two put on a surprisingly good contest.  The WWF has tried forever to put Test over as a Kevin Nash type character.  They just can't seem to find the right mix.  (8/10)

3. Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Kiebler (Lingerie Match)

I hate women's wrestling, but man this is a great.  Words cannot describe this match.  (8/10)

4. Edge vs. Christian (Intercontinental Title/Ladder Match)

Very, very good match.  This match is actually very underrated because you really don't hear much about it.  One of the better ladder matches you will see.  Both men are very innovative with the ladder.  More respect needs to be given to Christian for all the beatings and bumps he takes.  (10/10)

5. Dudley's vs. Big Show & Tajiri (WWF Tag Titles)

Very interesting comination of Big Show and Tajiri made for a pretty formidable tag team.  Pretty good match with a suprise appearance by Rhyno.  (8/10)

6. Undertaker vs. Booker T

These two built up a pretty good fued, althouh this match did not live up to its expectations.  Decent match.  (7/10)

7. The Rock vs. Chris Jericho (WCW Title)

Great match.  Another very underrated match.  This was the beginning of Jericho's rise up the ranks.  These two have great in ring chemistry.  The crowd actually started to cheer for Jericho in the match.  (9.5/10)

8. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kurt Angle vs. Rob Van Dam (WWF Title/Triple Threat & No DQ)

The biggest question going into this match was to see what side RVD was on:  the WWF or the Alliance.  Good match, just way too short.  (9/10)

I recommed picking up this DVD.  Definately pick it up for the ladder match and WCW title match.

Hardy Boyz v.s Lance Storm and the Hurricane (WCW tag team titles) 9/10
There is no better way to start a PPV then this. This was a great match with some really cool moves. Lita, Ivory and Mighty Molly get involved too. Hardy's win.
Test v.s Kane
8.5/10
Another really good match. These 2 give it there all for 10 minutes straight. Kane kicks out of everything until Test gets a huge big boot for the win. The after-match is really cool because Nick Patrick gets the hell beaten out of him. I totally loved this match.
Torrie Wilson v.s Stacy Keibler (first ever lingerie match)
8/10
The wrestling may not have been any Benoit/Angle match, but god dam those chicks are fine!
Edge v.s Christian (ladder match for the intercontinental title)
10/10
An amazing ladder match that goes for nearly 25 minutes. Both men take some of the biggest bumps of all time, especially Christian. Edge wins a classic ladder match and the title.
(Side note: Christian is the next Shawn Michaels, not Jeff Hardy or Y2J; the peep daddy is the next HBK!)
The Dudley Boyz v.s Big Show and Tajiri (WWF tag team titles)
8/10
This was a really good match. Even though it was probably was the worst match on the card, it was still good! Rhyno Gores Big show and the Dudleys win.
The Undertaker v.s Booker T
8/10
This could have been better. It was still good, but a no d-q stipulation would have worked better. Some good moves though and Undertaker wins with a last ride.
The Rock v.s Chris Jericho (WCW title)
9.5/10
This was one of the best matches of the year! Y2J finally wins the big one. The Rock puts Jericho over in an amazing match. Stephanie McMahon comes down and gets a rock bottom. Great match by 2 great athletes.
Stone Cold v.s Kurt Angle v.s Rob Van Dam (WWF title)
9/10
A great and worthy main event between 3 wrestlers with very different styles. RVD was in his first main event match and did really well. Kurt Angle was just Kurt Angle and he did an amazing moonsalt in this match. Austin wins after interference from Shane and Vince. Fantastic main event.

The Rock takes on Chris Jericho for the WCW Championship in an excellent bout with a lot of great athleticism. Edge takes on his brother Christian in a ladder match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. This ladder match was a bit boring in my opinion because it was simply too slow.

There was also a traditional face vs. face feud involving The Rock and Chris Jericho, which leads to another big match with the now defunct WCW strap on the line. There is lots more, including the conclusion of the sibling feud between Edge and Christian in a ever popular ladder match, along with The Undertaker and Kane looking for retrobution against Test and Booker T in singles competition. Many titles are up for grabs on this event, which is stacked with eight quality matches. I will review each match and give it a rating out of five stars (*****):
WCW Tag Team Championship - The Hardy Boyz (with Lita) vs. Lance Storm (with Ivory) and the Hurricane (with Mighty Molly): This is a good opening match, lots of near falls and excitement towards the end, with everyone including the ladies getting involved. ***1/4
Test vs. Kane: Pretty slow match, with a lot of brawling and power moves. The pace picks up a bit near the end, where both men try hard to quicken the pace, but this bout is mediocre at its best. *1/2
Lingerie Match - Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler: A  surprisingly decent outing, with both ladies looking great in their outfits. Some okay wrestling is also attempted, and this will please all male viewers. ***
Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match - Edge vs. Christian: Wicked ladder match between the brothes will with all the stops being pulled out. High risk spots and good grappling result in an awesome battle. ****1/2
WWE Tag Team Championship - Tajiri and The Big Show vs. The Dudley Boyz: Another good example of tag team wrestling with some awesome sequences building up to an exciting climax. ***
Undertaker vs. Booker T: Another slow paced match up, but some decent submission wrestling is thrown in along with some close near falls and a great ending. **3/4
WCW Championship - The Rock vs. Chris Jericho: AWESOME battle with loads of gripping action and thrilling sequences. Match of the night by a wide margin. ****3/4
WWE Championship Triple Threat Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Kurt Angle vs. Stone Cold: Another great bout to top off a spectacular event with loads of high spots from Rob Van Dam and great brawling from Angle and Austin. ****1/2
This is worth the money alone just for the last two matches, both which were brilliant. With other acceptable wrestling this is definately a four star event. It would of acheived five if it were not for the second and sixth matches, both of which had little heat and very slow brawling. Definately worth renting or even buying just for some of the action.

This PPV was my favorite of 2001 and maybe ever, this PPV had no weak matches they were either great or good man from the theme music to the stage to the pyro and finally the matches this was WWF at its best from top to bottm lets get the ball rollin' and review the matches....
1) WCW Tag Team Titles The Hardyz w/Lita(c) vs Lance Storm w/Ivory & Hurricane w/Mighty Molly 9/10- This was a great way to kick off No Mercy, so many double team moves and great action theres no slowing down or any slow spots this match had a steady pace all the way through and just kicked ***!
2)Kane vs Test 8.5/10- This match exceeded what expectations I had for it, Kane and Test pur on a very well fought match Kane has got ""hops"" but dang that dude can jump and dropkick someone nicely, this match was just great the ref was stupid (Nick Patrick) but the cool spots made up for it.....
3) 1st Ever Lingerie Match Stacy Keibler vs Torrie Wilson 10/10- This was one of those matches where it doesn't matter about the wrestling this was flat out awsome reminds me why I was called a perv in Junior High, the only bad was that stupid ref with a woody but hek I would've had one to, great match Stacy and Torrie are both FINE! Nice final pin, grab that ***!!
4) WWF InterContinental Title Ladder Match Edge vs Christian(c) 10/10- This was by far the best singles ladder match ever invented so many different usages of the normal household tool, the ladder.....and something that no other ladder match really had and thats a totally reeking of awsomeness finish! Great match brothers set a new bar in bro vs bro matches alot better than Hardy vs Hardy at Vengeance!!!
5)WWF Tag Tean titles Dudley Boyz(c) vs Big Show & Tajiri 8/10- This match was the second tag match of the night the first was a hard one to follow up too, but this match was also good, lots of spots and cool moves Rhyno was in there for no reason but to knock out Show which was pointless because Big Show looked like he got slapped in the stomach more than a ""GORE"" match was good with a nice ending.....
6) Undertaker vs Booker T 9/10-This match was a good wrestling match some nice moves by both men but could've had more, but still all in all good match with a predictable ending not very original but the match was still a good one!
7) WCW Title The Rock(c) vs Chris Jericho 10/10-This was the show stealer, the best damn WCW title match ever! People who said Rock cannot wrestler and either can Jericho were way off this showed the great chemistry The Rock and Jericho had with no boring moments this was great from top to bottom arguably Rock and Jericho's best match of their careers atleast one fo them, Jericho takes a sick Rockbottom through a table as Jericho reverses the People's Elbow with the Walls! This match just leaves you wanting more, the ending is great and Rock and Jericho put on a CLASSIC!
WWF Title Triple Threat No DQ match Stone Cold Steve Austin(c) vs Rob Van dam(HC Champ) vs Kurt Angle 9.5/10- This match had awsome spots and it really was a great main event, all of the men gave it all they had but I wanted RVD or Angle to win, unlike other triple threats this one was great and deserved to have RVD in it as he showcased what he had, just flat out great.....
Even though this DVD had no booklet or extras the event made up for it and it was great, I have to admit the cover is stupid but who cares, awsome PPV best quality matches of 2001 and just flat out a showcase of the legends to come!",1021075200,6,3519,4.285285285285285
1645201,4,B00005Q4EV,"This Pay Per View event had some awesome matches{especially the Lingerie match!!!!}some of the matches was the Triple Threat match and that was awesome!!!But I think the best match out of the whole show was the Ladder match with Edge against Christian because that match was so breathtaking,I kept on watching that match over and over again{except for the Lingerie match Wow!!!}So what I'am trying to say is that you have to get this DVD!!!!!!!!!!",1008979200,,447,4.973333333333334
1645202,4,B00005Q4EV,"This was a very entertaining event, I mean through and through, from the opening WCW Tag Team Title defense to the WWF Title Match.  The PPV 5 star match at No Mercy had to have been The Rock vs. Jericho, and second best was Edge vs. Christian.  This event really kept me on the edge of my seat.  I was really anticipating the WCW Championship match, and I got what I wanted.  No Mercy this year was better than last years, considering that The Rock has lost 2 different World Championships 2 straight years, that's simply horrible.  Like Unforgiven, it doesn't matter if you buy VHS or DVD, because the DVD had no extras at ALL, and didn't even come with a booklet.  I do recommend this to any WWF Fan, this event definitely made up for the weak Unforgiven this year.  Buy this now!!!",1008028800,,785,4.372413793103449

If you are a true wwf fan order now!
This ppv had a good ladder match but i expected much more.the only thing i ddint like about this match that it was too slow to set up the moves but it had a great endng involving 1 man,2chairs and 2 ladders!
the most  surprising match was rock vs jericho..i knew this was going to be a great to excellent match up but never knew it would have been 1 of the best match of there careers!
It was a defanete show stealer!
I was really excitited about the mainevent!!!!
As it was rob van dam's 1st main event match on ppv in the wwf. All 3 men did a good job but i rekon  it was a bit too short and honestly i thought RVD woulda done some moves with chairs and stuff as it was announced no dq. Other than that you have a fine ppv!",1007856000,,794,3.8650306748466257

If you have never seen this match, just buy this tape for that sole reason. Main Event features RVD and Kurt Angle try to take the WWF Championship from the rattlesnake Stone Cold Steve Austin.

1645208,5,B00005Q4EV,"Live from the Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri, No Mercy 2001 took place on October 21!  I had 4th row tickets and you can clearly see me throughout the show (especially when Austin & Angle spill out into the crowd: I brought a sign that on one side has ""Where's EZ Money?"" and on the other ""R V D"").  If you are a fan of the WWF or just great wrestling, you must buy this DVD.
Edge versus Christian for the WWF Intercontinental Title, the ladder match, was spectacular and will leave you breathless. ****1/2
Chris Jericho versus The Rock for the WCW Title was perhaps the finest match in The Rock's career and truly exemplified Y2J's great talent.  *****
Stone Cold versus Kurt Angle versus ""Mr. Pay Per View"" Rob *point* Van *point* Dam *point* was a good three-way dance with tons of classic spots. ****
This is without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best pay-per-views the WWF has done all year and should be a part of every sports-entertainment fan's DVD library.",1004486400,2,973,4.455056179775281

2. Test V.S Kane ***1/2- a lot more than I expected
3. First-Ever Lingerie Match: Stacy V.S Torrie ****1/2- I loved this match like any other man out there- the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's no Andre V.S Hogan
4. Ladder Match for the I.C Championship: Edge V.S Christian(c) ****- brother V.S brother was great- some great high spots and the one man conchairto on the top of the ladder was great
5. WWF Tag Team Championship: Big Show and Tajiri V.S The Dudley Boyz(c) ***- the only thing that made this great ws Tajiri, Big Show, and Rhyno's gore- dudley's performance was a bore
6. Taker V.S Booker T ****- Great match which ended the same as the one at W17- Booker T should have won
7. WCW Championship: Chris Jericho V.S The Rock(c) *****- show stealer- great performance and the Rock finally lost a match to a worthy apponent
8. Triple threat for the WWF Championship: RVD V.S Kurt Angle V.S Stone Cold(c) ****1/2- great match with plenty of high spots but not as entertaining as the Rock/Jericho

7949810,4,B00005Q4EV,"I used to have many WWF Home Video tapes from the late 90s , but have had most stolen or thrown away by parents over time. Remaining only in my collection of VHS was WWF St. Valentines Day Massacre In Your House 99 and WWF Fully Loaded IN Your House 98. The ppv No Mercy took place during my first year of college so i didn't have much time to watch WWF then. So for me this was perfect because I knew all the wreslters as it took place at the end of the WCW vs WWF angle that would wrap soon at Survivor Series the next month. (Yes, the bring Flair back the night AFTER survivor Series, after WCW has lost? whatever ...doesn't make sense) but anyway the show No Mercy was grand. The main events are top notch As the Triple Threat Austin WCW RVD ECW and Kurt Angle WWF are in a triple threat match for the WWF Championship! An exciting match helped by a hot St. Louis crowd. Also The WCW Championship is on the line in another stellar match between Chris Jerico and Rocky ""The Rock"" Maivia!
Only bad thing the tape was in EP mode, so it had low quality picture and sound. Its too bad as the SP WWF tapes that they used for most PPVS (Fully Loaded 98), Judgment Day In your House, Rock Bottom, and so on were in SP. The only ones I remember being in EP were WrestleMania XV and WrestleMania XIV. Maybe they are longer and decided that was easier and cheaper to do it that way. Really hurt the sound, and they were putting entrances in Stereo, remember at Breadown In Your House 98 with Shamrock theme, and Rocks nation theme being channel so nicely that at the time it was a wow!
Undertaker also takes on Booker T.
The WWF Tag Titles are in a match as the Dudley Boys Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-von Dudley take on the Big Show Paul Wight and Tajiri.
There is a long boring ladder match, thats the worst match on here between Edge and his brother Christian Cage. It s too bad as it was for the Intercontental Title, could have been a classic, instead this match has been buried its so bad,,
Torrie Wilson and Stacy wrestled in thier underwear.
kane battled Test, and The WCW tag team Titles were on the line as Hurricane Helms and Lance Storm teamed up against the WCW Tag Team Champs (who are in the WWF) The Hardy Boyz Matt and Jeff.

WWF and WCW title matches are tops.",1358294400,,2268,4.178082191780822
7949811,5,B00005Q4EV,"1.) WCW Tag Team Title Match: Hardy Boyz w/Lita vs Lance Storm w/Ivory and The Hurricane w/Mighty Molly

This is a pretty good opening match for this PPV! Lots of back and forth action between all 4 contestants and at one point, Lita gets involved in a fight with Molly and Ivory! Jeff hits the Swanton on Hurricane and Matt gets the pin for the victory! The only con about this, was not being able to see Lita in an actual match, against either Molly or Ivory, considering she was having problems with them both at the time.  Match rating: 9/10

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Test vs Kane

A battle of the powerhouses is what you get throughout this match. There are no hurricanranas or crossbodys in this match. What you get is a great showing from these two as Kane and Test really take it to each other thoughout this match. WCW referee Nick Patrick pretty much helps Test throughout the match. Test uses a ringbell but doesn't get DQd but when Kane tries to use a steel chair, Patrick distracts Kane causing Test to get the upperhand and the victory. Patrick doesn't get away though as Kane lays him out with 2 chokeslams and a powerbomb for his bias officiating.  Match rating: 10/10

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Lingerie Match: Stacy Keibler vs Torrie Wilson

After weeks of back and forth torment, this match was basically to see who could embarrass their opponent on PPV while lookng good and walk out the winner. Both Stacy and Torrie receive an A+ for their choice of attire in the match, but unfortunately this match doesn't last any longer than about 5 minutes. This match involves back and forth slapping, catfighting, choking, catfighting over the ref, spanking/whipping, etc. A back handspring off the ropes, spells the end for Stacy and a win for Torrie.  Match rating: 5/10

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match: Christian (C) vs Edge

After a dirty win by Christian at Unforgiven, Edge got a second chance to take the title from his brother in this brutal ladder match. This match may have very well been match of the night. Edge and Christian both take painful bumps throughout this match, judging from the looks on their face and the way they hold their body. This match isn't pretty as both E&C take all their knowledge and skills from previous Ladder matches they competed in and bring them in to fruition in this match up. Edge seizes the title after a sickening Conchairto to Christian sends him slumping off the ladder and out for the night.  Match rating: 10/10

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Tag Team Title Match: The Dudley Boyz (C) vs The Big Show and Tajiri

Not much to say about this match other than the fact that the Dudleyz practically beat the crap out of Tajiri in its entirity. Tajiri accidentally sprays mist in the ref's eyes, leading to Rhyno interfering and Goring the Big Show, leading to a 3D from the Dudleyz on Tajiri for the win.  Match rating: 4/10

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Booker T vs Undertaker

After getting a pinfall victory over Undertaker on the previous Thursday's Smackdown, the 5x WCW Champion had to fight the American Badass again! This was a hell of a performance from 2 future Hall of Famers in a match that looked like it could've gone pretty much either way, but Taker takes the victory after a Last Ride on Booker.  Match rating: 10/10

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WCW Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs The Rock (C)

This match had much more than just the WCW Title to it. This match was also about Jericho proving he could win the ""Big One"" and defeat the Great One. This match was 2nd best of the night! Y2J locks horns with the Brahama Bull to try and take the title away and shut all the doubters up once and for all. A surprise interference from Stephanie McMahon causes enough distraction for Jericho to use the Breakdown on Rock on a steel chair and get the pinfall win for the WCW Title.  Match rating: 10/10

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Triple Threat WWF Championship Match: Kurt Angle vs RVD vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (C)

In this awesome main event bout, Kurt Angle and Alliance member RVD attempt to swipe the WWF Heavyweight Title from the paranoid Alliance leader, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Throughout this match, it seems as if all 3 men were close to winning the match, only to have their pin broken by an opponent. Shane and Vince make an appearance in this match and brawl with each other, which ultimately causes Austin to retain the title and escape St. Louis, still the Champion.  Match rating: 10/10

Overall: This was a pretty good PPV! Only 1 or 2 matches that slacked in the excitement level, but for the most part it was pretty good and recommend this PPV to anyone who's looking for a good old WWF PPV to watch",1353456000,,5500,5.606280193236715
7949812,4,B00005Q4EV,"The WCW Tag Team title match between The Hardy Boyz against the team of Lance Storm & The Hurricane was very good for a opener. The Kane-Test match started horribly but got better as the match went on. The Lingerie match between Stacy Keibler & Torrie Wilson was pointless & painful to watch. The Ladder match for the Intercontinental between Edge & Christian was surprisingly boring. The WWF tag team title match betweeen The Dudley Boyz against the team of The Big Show & Tajiri was not great but pretty good. The Booker T-Undertaker match was so-so in terms of wrestling and it could have done better in terms of storytelling. The WCW title match between Chris Jericho & The Rock was a hard-hitting,heart-pounding,nail-biting match of the night. The 3 way No-DQ match for the WWF title(RVD vs Steve Austin vs Kurt Angle) was also not great but pretty good and could have done better without the McMahons at ringside.

1)hardys vs hurricane and lance storm 6/10
this match is a regular tag match it was fast paced but wasn't very long and didn't have time to develop into much but its watchable
2)Kane vs Test 8/10
this match surprised me it wasn't slow and boring like i had expected its one of the better matches of the night IMO it was given a good amount of time the referee situation gets kind of annoying
3)Lingerie Match Stacy Vs Torrie 1/10 for wrestling 9/10 for the women
ok we all know this wasn't gonna be a technical encounter its fun for one or two watches thats about it
4)Ladder Match Intercontinental Title Edge vs Christian 8/10
this match is the most overhyped of the night the first ten minutes are painfully slow and u see the same moves as the other E&C ladder matches nothing new here a little boring especially with the other ladder matches that took place in 2001 Jericho vs Benoit and RVD vs Jeff Hardey
5)Tajiri and Big Show vs Dudleys 7/10
again another normal tag match a little better than the opening match but still nothing spectacular u get some interference late in the match and the winners are who u would expect
6)Booker T vs Undertaker 7/10
i was expecting alot out of this match maybe that was the problem i havnt seen their Judgment Day match so i cant comment on that one but this one is mostly a brawl but not an exciting brawl the ending comes with taker hitting the last ride out of the corner like so many times before
7)Chris Jericho vs The Rock WCW Title 9/10
this is where it picks up a little this is the match of the night IMO these two worked well together with jericho stealing some of the rock's moves and getting some close pinfalls the ending is kind of confusing with the interference but i don't remember much from WWF 2001
8)Stone Cold vs Angle vs RVD WWF Title 8/10
this could have been the match of the night if they would have given it more time come on 16 min for a triple threat main event but in those 16 mins these three never slow down its high impact all the way through with no rests along the way kind of a cheap ending but it doesnt take away from the match overall",1244160000,,2258,4.238979118329467
