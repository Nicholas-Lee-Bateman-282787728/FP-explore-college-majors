2873299,5,B000ROAMCU,"I originally bought this DVD solely for ""Hearts Adrift"", which was a USA Network original movie that aired in 1995. I have been waiting for the DVD release for years and have searched pretty much every movie website & media store for VHS copies, but to no avail. Then, Amazon.com finally sent me notice that it was being released & would be available. I was thrilled!!

Sydney Penny & Scott Reeves are a winning combination as polar opposites, who come together, thanks to their widowed parents, whom happen to share a romantic past of their own. This film is a great testament to the adage that ""sometimes you need to go back in order to move forward"". It also happens to feature several well-known soap (daytime and primetime) stars. In addition to Penny (All My Children et al.) & Reeves (The Young & the Restless), it also features Kathleen Noone & Don Murray of ""Knots Landing"" fame and Nicholas Coster (Santa Barbara et al.). With a bit supporting part played by Julie Benz of Showtime's thrill ride ""Dexter"", as a young debutante vying for Reeves' Kyle Raines' affections with Penny's Max.

The other film in this double feature is ""Journey of the Heart"" with Cybill Shepard, whom I also enjoy and wish she would either return to TV or make more films, preferably with Bruce Willis. I have loved them together ever since ""Moonlighting"" and miss their effortless spark & terrific chemistry together. ""Journey"" is a very heartfelt film based on a true story of a blind, mentally challenged, musical savant pianist and his courageous mother/family. I recall seeing the movie on TV or cable many years ago. It was definitely a tender & heartwarming refresher.",1203638400,8,1662,4.8076923076923075

8202017,4,B000ROAMCU,"I had watched Hearts Adrift when I was a teenager and have been looking for the movie ever since. I'd catch it on Lifetime either right as it came on or 5mn into the show it always seemed. So I never got the chance to record it. And they stopped showing it after a time. So to get the chance to buy this dvd, and see it as well as the other movie. Was a treasure. I loved them both. Thank you! Showed up on time, was new, packaging was great. It did skip 2x but other then that it was great. & I can't say my player didn't need a clean out.",1326499200,,540,3.7876106194690267
8202018,5,B000ROAMCU,"Very good movie.  I had seen it on TV years ago.  After meeting Tony DeBlois and his mother and hearing Tony perform, it meant a lot more.  For more detail and accuracy, I recommend his biography, Some Kind of Genius by Janice DeBlois, available at his web site or maybe used at Amazon.com.

8202019,1,B000ROAMCU,This movie was very disappointing.  I expected it to be very different and especially good because Sybil Shepard starred in it.  Sorry I can't give a better review.  I really feel I wasted my $$.,1282089600,,195,4.514285714285714
8202020,5,B000ROAMCU,The dvd was in great condition and I have been able to watch it every night and every day since I received it. I will order again. The price was great.,1268870400,,151,3.903225806451613
8202021,5,B000ROAMCU,"Heart's Adrift I watched by mistake on TV and it was fabulous. The story line was heartwarming, romantic and just worth every bit of time to watch it.  I have to get the DVD but want it solo.  So will have to keep searching for it.  If you are in to the ""chick-flick"" genre or enjoy a great love story with a touch of drama this one is it.  Great actors with great chemistry indeed.  Really enjoyed it! Well done.",1263600000,,413,4.1125
