8262173,5,B0016D7S8C,"I can't wait to collect the rest of Yakov's comedy concerts. In this one, he was obviously pleased enough over his new American citizenship to place a very patriotic slant on his presentation. Always with his trademark out-of-the-box point of view concerning the unusual & frequently odd customs & culture which make this nation so entertaining & attractive to foreigners.",1400976000,3,372,5.216666666666667
8262174,5,B0016D7S8C,"You've got to be very, very good to fill a theater in Branson night after night... and Yakov Smirnoff is very, very good.  He's not just funny; he's likeable and entertaining.  His DVD has the standup comedy, but it also has music and dancing and moves right along.  A winner for people of all ages!",1234396800,3,299,4.4
