7836655,4,6303072232,"Donald O'Connor gave a glow to just about anything he ever appeared in.  He's wonderful here, too.  In Francis, the Sequel, he's back as sweet-natured, newly discharged Army Lieutenant, Peter Stirling.  The film picks up where the original left off, so there's a nice feeling of continuity to it.  Poor Peter can't seem to stay out of trouble, and poor Francis can't keep himself from coming to the rescue, much though he might like to.  There's a nifty scene of Francis' over-imbibing and slobbering affection all over his human buddy, and a brief duet of ""My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean"" between Peter and Francis that's just enchanting.  Nice film.  Not the best in the series, but a fine sequel and well worth seeing.",1074643200,,720,4.758064516129032
