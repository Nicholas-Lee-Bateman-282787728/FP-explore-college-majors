Suddenly ""Clone Baby"" had been subbed as ""colon baby"" and other laughable mistakes to the point we stopped watching it and went to find an alternate last episode.",1362700800,,243,4.545454545454546
8478152,5,B004HDVNPM,I love this drama! Its one of these mystery action dramas. In the begining you have a student on top of a building who is going to commite suicide by rumping off but before does another guy on the roof appears and tells him his death will help him and he pushes him off instead. You have no idea whats going on in the begining but its interesting and as you watch the drama little by little eveything falls into place. The subtitles in this one are very good but the last episode is....well there not bad but slightly not as good and their names change to chinese names. This is one is a good buy if i had the chance i would buy it again!,1353110400,,638,4.071428571428571
