8095725,5,B000C65YK8,My husband has a 70 442 and he loved this dvd.  It was a great over view of the different cars though probably didn't give him any information that he didn't already know.  But he enjoyed it and that was enough!,1387324800,,211,4.121951219512195
8095726,5,B000C65YK8,"My favorite muscle car ever... the 1970 Buick GSX. My second favorite... the 1970 Olds 442 W30. Both of these great cars are featured on the same DVD. What's not to love? In all seriousness though, this is a great summary. It doesn't cover every detail, but it is fairly comprehensive on both automobiles. I will watch this one often.",1372723200,,334,4.583333333333333
