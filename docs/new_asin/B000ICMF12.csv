No table of contents, list of dance patterns is weak, only says that they are ""variations.""
It is impossible to find the exact spot on the DVD where patterns are. So I have to write down the time on the DVD where the move is I want to learn. The lack of patterns is very noticeable. I only learned four new patterns, which makes these discs very expensive.

Disk 2 is 117 minutes long, with a self-glorification introduction of a wasted 14 minutes. These dance teachers love to promote themselves on how good they are by showing off the contests they have won. BUT, they keep showing the same clips over and over again.

There is a huge emphasis on footwork movements. Personality I think this emphasis should be done more on the advanced intermediate level. Learners can become discouraged with the emphasis on footwork, arm work, and leading patterns. Some of these footwork lessons are for the advanced learner.

Esoteric principals of W.C. like connection, and push-pull may turn off someone learning W.C. These need to be practiced with a private teacher, or in-group classes by both leaders and followers.

A little to soft spoken, and the pacing is too slow. Somewhat expensive for the amount of dance material that a person can learn. If they would cut out all the self-glorification dance material, reduce the emphasis on footwork, and reduce the amount of time devoted to advanced connection work, then I would rate it higher.

[...]

ALL instructional dance DVD'S should be an adjunct to private lessons, and group lessons at a dance studio, or dance club.

Still a little boring, and talkative. I hardly ever watch it. May be OK for beginners. January 11, 2012.",1246233600,2,1797,4.792880258899676
8145252,3,B000ICMF12,"There is some good and some bad to this product. It seems the makers wanted to put as much as possible into it. So, they only demonstrate the moves a few times. This means that I had to rewind the video often. Also, I don't need to see out takes of their competition every few minutes.

Also, these videos do not play with all of the major video players on the market today. It is very limited in that sense. I would like to see that expanded.

It is evident that they know what they are doing and you will learn lots of good moves and solid basics from this video, but it will take a while. Once I learned it, I didn't want to forget it and have to go through the whole rewind session again. So, I practiced.",1179705600,2,709,4.057142857142857
8145253,4,B000ICMF12,"This double DVD is a good way to get your feet wet in what is not exactly the most newcomer friendly or easily leadable of the social dances.

Not cheap, but probably one of the best intros to WCS available.

The only thing that could be improved would be to make the on screen menu less clunky (hence only 4 stars).",1173571200,3,316,4.163934426229508
