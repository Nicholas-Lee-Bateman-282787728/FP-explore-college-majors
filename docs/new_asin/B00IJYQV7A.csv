6266745,5,B00IJYQV7A,"I looked forward with great anticipation to watching this DVD.  It turned out that this was Michael Jackson at the top of his game.  The concert was recorded by a television network in Yokohoma, Japan in 1987.  Although concert footage was not the same nearly 25 years ago as it is today, this DVD sounds great and Michael and his band are truly in top form.  Especially enjoyable was ""Beat It"", ""Thriller"" and the incredible and touching duet he does with then virtually unknown back-up singer Sheryl Crow on ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"".  At the price of less than $10, this is the best deal on a greatest hits collection available today.  Buy it, watch it, enjoy this cool piece of Michael's recorded legacy.",1247356800,13,713,4.619047619047619
6266746,1,B00IJYQV7A,"Do not buy this DVD. A HUGE disappointment. Quality is extremely poor; it's dark, and blury.  Save your money or get the Live In Bucharest DVD (great quality).",1247184000,4,159,4.678571428571429
6266747,4,B00IJYQV7A,"I enjoyed watching Michael Jackson perform some of his all-time greatest hits. This DVD contained outdoor concert performances during Jackson's 1987 ""Bad Tour.""  Michael performed two concert dates while he was in Yokohama, Japan. (Note:  Michael's ""Bad"" album wasn't released until August 31, 1987 which contained the song, ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" -- towards the end of ""Shake Your Body Down,"" a caption was listed for Yokohama Stadium, Sept 26, 1987). The ""Bad Tour"" was Jackson's first solo tour (without his brothers), so this concert footage clearly wasn't recorded in ""1985."" Michael's magical showmanship is undeniable during his energetic performances.

Sheryl Crow is featured as one of Jackson's back-up singers.  She accompanied Michael in a duet, singing ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You."" I thought they performed well together on stage.  The DVD's overall picture and sound is not top quality, but its still worth it to have in your Michael Jackson collection. The DVD footage captured a piece of history and I personally consider it as memorabilia, which can be passed down to future generations. There will never, ever be another Michael Jackson. He may have left the world physically; however, his music, spirit, and legacy will last forever. Rest in Peace.",1247184000,33,1278,5.214634146341464
6266748,1,B00IJYQV7A,"Dont buy this. The songs were there and so was Michael but the footage was so so so bad. I don't think it ever appeared as a VHS in the first place. I believed it was bootlegged by a group that called itself the Crane Crews, the guys who probbaly held the cameras during the concert. I just bought it today from a shop here in Singapore and am kicking myself for it. The Bucharest concert is better.",1246924800,32,399,4.128205128205129
6266749,4,B00IJYQV7A,"I wanted to see concert footage other than the all too well known Bucharest dvd with footage that showed more of the audience than Michael and his band (except when they were doing dance moves.) While that DVD is good it's not the Michael I like to see performing nor the Michael I am used to seeing perform. This particular DVD concert footage doesn't have the familiar song lineup. Not too much out the norm but there are songs from the J5 days. Not just the cute little J5's medley (I'll be there, I want you back, The love you save, etc.) but the young adult J5's. Songs like 'It's the things I do for you', 'Shake your body down', 'Lovely one' and 'Heartbreak Hotel'.

This is more of the type of concert I like because he not only danced his butt off but he sings too. Many people forget he could actually sing...and well! He mixes up his dance moves but he doesn't forget to sing here and it's a real treat. Although, by the time he gets to 'Billy Jean' he's a little winded from all the dancing but quickly recovers for a very entertaining, loonngg 'Shake your body down'. In my opinion, I see him smiling more here than any other concert footage I've seen since he was a shorty. He seemed to be having a good time here, egging the audience on to participate in a Whoo hoo fest! Or having back and forth vocal exchanges with his background singers.

Now with all this praise you may be wondering why I didn't give this dvd 5 stars. Well, it's the clarity, plain and simple. The sound is okay but it looks as if someone recorded this onto a VHS tape, put that recording onto another VHS and then copied the copy onto DVD with stereo sound. If you feel you need clarity to enjoy your concerts, then this is definitely not the one you should buy. I must admit I was very pissed because I think the concert as a whole is great but to see it in such a 70's format in this digital age is ridiculous.

I don't know who thought this was good enough to put out on the market but who ever it is needs to be shot. Twice! I set out to purchase this before Mike's passing was announced. Although, I am not happy with the way this views I am glad I purchased it. Bottom line; After watching this concert, it's understood why the brother could self assuredly say, 'I'm Bad' and no one could argue that fact!

RIP  'MJ didn't play'",1246924800,112,2323,4.246606334841629

6266764,4,B00IJYQV7A,This is great concert footage. Some are saying it doesnt have the right line up. But Michael's first leg of the tour was basically more of the old songs. The second tour is when he introduces more of the new Bad songs. Despite not having the new songs it was still a great concert DVD. Would recommend for all the Michael Jackson fans.,1345593600,,335,4.333333333333333
6266765,3,B00IJYQV7A,"I loved this concert footage of Michael performance in Japan back in Sept. 26th 1987. He looked ever bit stunning, lively, and professional.

The only down side to the DVD was ITS QUALITY and its written info! When I was ready to watch 'Things I Do for You' and '(You Are My) Lovely One' the DVD kept pausing and in a few cases even jumped to the next performance!

Another thing I found embarassing was the spelling mistakes on a few of the songs on the DVD case AND even once on the DVD itself!

Although the photos of Michael on the DVD case were okay, they weren't of the 'Bad' era and were of the 'Dangerous' and 'HIStory' eras. That CAN confuse some people if they buy this DVD on the Internet!

Watching Michael was of course a joy, but I only just wish that the DVD quality and info were a bit better.",1335484800,,809,4.2

6266767,5,B00IJYQV7A,"This is the first time I have ever written a review for a product purchased from Amazon.com, and I buy from them often. Could not help but share my opinion about what I believe to be one of the most awesome, entertaining and inspirational MJ performances ever!!! I have been a fan for many years and watched a LOT of footage (concerts, videos, commercials, etc) but never seen anything like this. The picture quality is not perfect but totally visible and the sound quality is good. I could've never forgiven myself if I decided to pass on this purchase. Michael is beautiful, sounds great, and totally KICKS ASS with his dancing in this concert. Love it from start to finish...ALWAYS IN MY HEART...I LOVE YOU MJ!!!",1335225600,,715,4.682539682539683
6266768,4,B00IJYQV7A,"People are complaining about the quality of this DVD. There isn't much good footage of Michael's Bad Tour unfortunately. Hopefully soon there will be better footage or even a new DVD for us (I pray every day for this)

For me this is awesome...I don't even care that it's not super excellent quality. I can see him dancing his ass off and hear his beautiful voice...that's all that matters to me!! I watch this frequently. It's one of my favorites!!",1329696000,,449,4.6125
6266769,4,B00IJYQV7A,"Last night I found 'Michael Jackson - Live In Japan' while sifting through clearance priced DVDs at Walgreens. Upon first glance of the DVD, I noticed it's lackluster cover art, so my expectations weren't high, but for $5.99, it was worth a shot. Well, upon first view of the DVD, I noticed the grainy quality and not so crisp audio, but it was in 5.1 surround sound (LOL), and even with those deficiencies, I still enjoyed the rare footage of MJ from 1987's 'Bad Tour'. The DVD had a decent menu, but was pretty 'bare bones' and I'm happy with 'Live In Japan', which is MUCH BETTER (in my opinion) than 'Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour'. That DVD was indeed sharp visually and had better sound, BUT the cameras would NOT stay focused on Michael's performance...In other words, they went back & forth showing hysterical fans passing out & crying OVER & OVER again during the concert. At any rate, I recommend the affordable 'Live In Japan' DVD to Michael Jackson fans.",1328918400,,991,4.668571428571428
6266770,5,B00IJYQV7A,"I don't know why everyone is complaining about the quality.  It's not as bad as many of the reviewers are saying.  You do have to realize that it was filmed in the 80s. Therefore, the quality isn't as good as it today and considering it is most likely a fan who shot it, you all should be glad that it is even around!  If it wasn't for this, do you really think the Estate would release something like this?  I doubt it!  If you are a true MJ fan, you will appreciate this.  If not, don't get it and quit whining!",1319414400,,513,4.02970297029703
6266771,4,B00IJYQV7A,I love this DVD but quality isn't that good. I feel it could be bootlegged as there are parts in the live show that they do camera tricks or something to double him and the pixels show a bit too much. Still like it though.,1313107200,,222,3.9555555555555557
6266772,5,B00IJYQV7A,"Excellent performance!!! As usual, Michael was spectacular.  The audience was wonderful, too.  The best I have ever seen Michael perform for. They appeared to truly enjoy him without getting hysterical.  I suppose it's the Japanese sense of order. If you love Michael and want to enjoy his concert without having to endure emotionally out of control girls being stupid and passing out and crap, you definitely want this DVD in your collection.",1306713600,,443,5.125
6266773,3,B00IJYQV7A,"I was/am looking forward to receiving this., but a cautionary note.. I ordered Live in Japan, but rec'd Number Ones, with a Live in Japan label on it, so there is a problem with the DVD being labeled correctly,  am in the process of straightening out, but hesitate ordering again if there is a problem with this DVD not being labeled correctly..

finally rec'd the correct DVD,  Thank you Amazon for your great customer service,  if you are ANY sort of a fan all at, you will love this!!  Yes the graphics and packaging are a little 'hokey', but it is what inside that counts.  This man was truly extraordinary, fantastic vocals and all the while dancing his a** off.  This is one of ways I like to remember him.  I guess I am not a purist when it comes to the quality (I think it is entirely watchable), it definitely captures Michael's heart and soul and that's what his real fans are interested in.  I think I'll watch it again tonite!!",1303171200,,939,4.412790697674419

Not the seller's fault, though.  They sent it on time and in good condition.",1294963200,,251,4.081632653061225
6266776,2,B00IJYQV7A,I borrowed a copy from the library so I can preview it before buying. And I am glad I did. The quality was so bad I don't think it was ever meant for release. I know this was the 80s but come on- the quality was so bad it looked like it was shot with a home video camera. And they had the nerve to slap the Dolby Digital logo on the package!

I was expecting to have possibly wasted my money and time.  I put this in my DVD player and was SHOCKED!!!  HE IS SIMPLY GORGEOUS in this DVD!!!  Yes, true, the quality is not anywhere near today's HDTV quality (it was filmed over 20 years ago) - but he is still simply amazing and beautiful to watch.  I popped it in while finishing up my English paper - and what did you expect - my paper is still unfinished.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for even a second!!  If you are a TRUE DEDICATED fan of MJ, then you will see no flaw in this DVD.  A little fuzzy and out-of-focus shots here and there doesn't make a difference, because a true fan can see pass that - and watches the AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL Human that is pouring out his heart and soul in music.  I also LOVE that this was an earlier Bad concert, before he got super skinny from the long tour - He has the best ever ""dancer's body"" and I love that BELT!!!  I want every memory of MJ to keep forever - and this is definitely one I am now GLAD that I have.  LOVE YOU FOREVER MJ - RIP and I will miss you forever!!!",1293148800,,1253,4.02834008097166

6266781,3,B00IJYQV7A,"Being a MJ fan I was excited to buy this DVD. I sat down to watch and must
say I was disappointed in the quality of the picture and also to observe
the old songs of Michael were faster than the ones on the CD's I have and
not used to that. I found myself using the FF button at times to get past
some of the songs. I was hoping that this would be better than the later
concerts like ""Dangerous"" but they weren't. I have viewed the History concerts
on my computer and must say they were better than ""Live in Japan"". The crowd
was less involved in the singing, maybe because of where it was done. Oh, well
thought I might just give my opinion as I spent more for this one than even
for the one with Michael's greatest Hits Video's. That was wonderful to view.",1287273600,,757,4.053333333333334

I think the term for the problem is called delaminating.  Whatever the cause, I tried to convey the issue with my seller, but was told to send the whole DVD back, and hope for the best that the new DVD will not mess up too.  I doubt it!  Please don't spend too much on this DVD.  If it messes up on you, then you won't be too upset.  The DVD contents is nice.  This is MJ at his best.  More Jackson 5 stuff and definitely great singing and dancing.  Visually it looks like everyone is more stretched and shorter than they really are.

6266786,4,B00IJYQV7A,"Jackson's voice is at its prime and he sings every single song on this concert with no lip synching like in some of the later Dangerous era concerts. This concert is not better than the Bucharest concert in terms of production quality and song selection, but this one shows Jackson in his prime at the beginning of the Bad era. There are other great clips out there of him during this time period (google ""Dirty Diana Live"") but they have not been released yet as a full concert.

This Live in Japan concert doesn't have the best song selection and only a couple of songs from the Bad album. I was also disappointed to see that ""Heartbreak Hotel"" was not the Elvis cover but an unknown song. The sound on all of the songs funky, perhaps due to the mixing. This seemed like a best of Jackson funky.

This is a great video for collectors and it seems to be more rare these days, though I bought it for $10 at Borders. I look forward to the release of more Jackson concerts.",1280534400,2,971,4.329670329670329

6266788,4,B00IJYQV7A,"First off, the overblown criticism over the video quality claiming this isn't
worth owning because it's not High Definition, or whatever, is misguided.  This
is pure gold: MJ singing live from start to finish.  The 1987-era video quality
could certainly be better by today's standards, but the content is what counts.

The packaging is strange, depicting MJ in later years (circa 2000) and not
1987 when this concert was performed.

None of this matters.

The performance is fantastic, as the concert for the most part entails MJ
alone on the stage dancing lightly (and hence, not out of breath) and singing
in fine form.  Later concerts would feature elaborate lighting and dance
routines, which to some degree overshadowed the superhuman talent that was
Michael Jackson.  This is the basics: a few lights, a microphone, and a gifted
individual having fun and delivering musical magic.

A no brainer purchase, especially at Amazon's price.

On a side note, for the best MJ concert available (far better than the Bucharest
DVD) look around for the ""Michael Jackson Live in Munich 1997"" concert.  If his
legacy could be distilled down into one performance, that would be it.",1267228800,8,1173,5.0310880829015545
6266789,2,B00IJYQV7A,"On the one hand, I'm glad to see an earlier MJ concert after having seen Bucharest & ""This is It""  It's good to see him looking energetic, healthy & young.

Unfortunately, the experience is marred by poor audio and video.  It's really painful in these days of HD computer monitors and when even cheap speakers give sound quality that far exceeds what's on this DVD.

I do feel the later concerts were better -- a bit more paced.  Even this concert gets a bit better paced as it goes on.  The early part of this concert is so frenetic that it's exhausting to warch.  I can imagine Michael's fevered imagination as he thinks back to his childhood where he would be beaten if he made a mistake -- or maybe just for good measure.  He dances as if the devil is on his back.

Still, I don't see how a real MJ fan could avoid purchasing it.

A curious aspect of this video is that the photos on the cover are all from other concerts and DVDs.  None of them are from this concert.",1266624000,2,972,4.228260869565218

I enjoyed this concert series more then the dangerous tour for a two reasons: It had more soul, ""Rock With You"", ""Shake Your Body"" and ""I just cant stop loving you"" had parts in it where you will think you are in church. And, He sing LIVE on EVERY SONG! with Extreme dancing throughout. I've been watching it everyday, and let my mother borrow it, but now im back to get her her own!!!!

I only saw Michael perform live once and I was very far away. I think this gives any Jackson fan an inkling of what it must have been like to be at a live performance when he was just smoking hot on every level. The Billy Jean on this is crazy good. I think this is one of the best examples of just the man in concert at his best. The duet with an almost unrecognizable, channeling Stevie Nicks, Cheryl Crow is great. There was NO ONE like him and this DVD is definitely worth having.",1263600000,,649,4.118110236220472

But if you're a Michael Jackson fan, you won't be disappointed. The 'flavour' of the concert is so strong.  In spite of the 'quality' of the DVD, the concert itself  is so exciting.  I actually went out and bought Jackson 5 Destiny and Victory tour CD's as I found the songs  so great to hear on this BAD concert.  Older songs are included - Shake Your Body Down, Heartbreak Hotel, Lovely One etc that aren't included in the more recent concerts such as the brilliant Bucharest DVD.  The dancing in Japan is just unbelievable.  The interaction between Michael Jackson and some of the dancers is phenomenal.  Shake Your Body would have to be one of the most memorable performances - so physical - explosive in fact.  Testosterone charge is the best way to describe it I think.  Both the singing and dancing  left me breathless.  It also really brought back the androgony flavour/look/feel of the '80's. I highly recommend it to all Michael Jackson fans.",1263081600,2,1165,4.788944723618091

I just can't get enough of MJ on youtube. Believe me there is a ton on youtube but I'd like to have it for my very own on a DVD. I plan to donate my MJ books to the local library after I've read them. It is a way to get out that he was innocent and that his kind of entertainment talent only happens once. I am a new fan; post MJ's death. To keep his legacy alive we need to spread the word. I'd like to see a book dedicated soley to MJ's humanitarian deeds.

While Michael gives unbelievable perfection in every thing he does during this concert, the film and sound quality are poor...I'm sure that it was not filmed for DVD (not in 1987 of course), and unlike the Bucharest DVD, was not mastered to show on HBO. Personally, I can see better live footage of MJ during his HIStory tour on YouTube.  From what I've seen so far regarding live concerts available on DVD, the Bucharest DVD is by far the best.

MICHAEL JACKSON - LIVE IN JAPAN is an awesome DVD, and a must have for MJ fans! I'll be the first to point out that the viewing quality is not what you get in the Bucharest DVD, but don't be turned off by that. All it took for me was to watch the first couple of songs, and I was used to the viewing quality. Trust me, the quality of MJ's performace far outweighs any issues with the viewing quality! It is a chance to see a live performance of some of Michael's earlier work, like ""Off the Wall,"" ""Rock With You,"" ""Lovely One,"" and ""Shake Your Body!"" That is only to name a few!

The DVD had taken bits of the BAD TOUR in Japan instead of the whole concert from beginning to end. The editing was not very smooth. Great songs, great dance. People get to see how Michael danced during the late 80's. The only thing that bothered me was the visual quality. It seems like they made DVD out of an old video without remaster it. Another thing is the pictures on the cover jacket, well, those are photos of MJ during HISTORY years. Not BAD years. That's a big mistake. The photos on the cover should match the content of the DVD.

The author - whoever copied this onto a DVD - knows very little - if anything about MJ. The picture on the cover features MJ in Earthsong which was featured during History tour 1996 / 1997. Other pictures on the cover are from middle to late 90's - totally unrelated to the contents of the DVD.

The contents of the whole DVD is BAD tour! I have been looking for this footage for over a decade and am very grateful I finally have it! It is not hi-def but who cares? It is over 20 years old and hard to find. Michael is SUPER! It is nowhere as theatrical as his last tours (Dangerous or  History), nor does he change his clothes but a couple of times, BUT he SINGS LIVE and DANCES like crazy.

It is a great concert while it appears incomplete and the picture appears fuzzy and grainy at times on my DVD player i popped it into my computer and it appeared to be quite a bit better while not perfect it is not at all too bad for a recorded concert over 20 years old people should keep that in mind while trying to decide whether or not to purchase this nothing that old is going to be perfect. but i can definitely say without a doubt that he was definitely at the top of his game during this period of time doing all the dance moves he became known for and to the best of my knowledge appeared to be singing on every single song no backing tracks or Lip-syncing here.,1257552000,2,806,4.0754716981132075

I spent the first few hours trying to figure out what the dancers looked like and what they were wearing. All the people looked orangish and pinkish in color, and like fun house mirror reflections where they appeared super square and chunky and out of proportion. Although I was glad to not see so much of the screaming audience as in the Bucharest concert, the zooming in and out and different camera angle shots of MJ made me dizzy after a while. If I closed my eyes and just listened, MJ's singing was/is truly amazing. In fact, the ballads he sings in this concert sound better than the ones he sings in the Bucharest concert. But if you have to close your eyes to avoid being visually assaulted by the horrific lack of resolution and clarity, you might as well just buy his CDs. Also, there are three songs where not just the resolution but also the audio is poor and since I don't know the lyrics to all of his songs, I had no idea what MJ was singing. (I have since then looked-up the song lyrics.)I love MJ as much for his dancing as I do for his singing, so this DVD was as huge disappointment. If MJ's dancing is as important as his singing to you, then buy the Bucharest concert DVD and not this one.",1256947200,2,1373,4.325581395348837

In 1987. So for $8 you get a great and rare DVD a must for diehard MJ fans like me. Another note this Concert is filmed in Widescreen (the only one so far)so a plus for hdtv owners. So either wait for an official release or buy

6266828,5,B00IJYQV7A,"I am reviewing this DVD on the week that ""This Is It"" coming out to the theaters. I am so excited about that so I went through my MJ stuff this past weekend. When I got this DVD, I bought it mostly based on great reviews of the people who purchased this at the time (July/August 2009) on amazon.com. I have never played it until this last weekend. I see now that reviews are not as good. People have different views on what's good or not. But for $7.99 - you can't lose with this DVD.

This is recording of Michael Jackson concert in Japan during his Bad Tour (September 1987). It looks like recording from TV broadcast of the concert. It was shot with professional, multiple cameras and multiple angles. It's all there. All shots and close-ups of the stage, of the band, of Michael are there and good. Most importantly the sound is clear and great. The concert is there in its entirety.

I am not sure what the definition of bootleg is but I wouldn't call this a bootleg. There are multiple angles to this recording and over-all quality picture quality is good. It definitely does NOT have DVD HD picture quality, nor 5.1 DTS surround sound feature. The footage might be raw and un-edited too much. The production is very low. It looks like VHS recording that was put on DVD with the minimal efforts. But, to me that gave it the raw feel of the time when it was recorded and none of the technical non-perfections did not bother me.

Michael Jackson's performance on this recording is unbelievable. I think during this time he earned the title of THE KING. I also see how people in the audience would get unconscious and pass out. Michael's singing was flawless. He was performing at the giant stadium to the audience of thousands of people and his voice was just beautiful. He didn't skip a single note. His dance moves here are stunning. We all saw his moves in his videos. But dancing during the live concert wher4e anything can go wrong is another thing. He really was amazing and breathtaking. I was surprised that on this performance/tour Michael Jackson was more R'n'B than pop. Every single music note was played (by musicians obviously). There was no sampling of his recording anywhere and even if there was, it was very rough and for seconds. There definitely was NO lip-syncing what nowadays we see all the time on any performances.

I'd recommend this DVD to everyone who's interested to see what Michael live performance was like ...",1256601600,3,2446,4.577625570776256

If you want to get HIStory Tour DVD and Bad Tour DVD, you would have to settle for second retailers. With that being said, I am very happy with this purchase!!

 Michael Jackson sang all through the concert and looked soooo happy! He smiled a lot and was just so enjoying himself with this first leg of his solo concert!

 The songs were from his early days, and I LOVED seeing him so happy, young and smiling! This is a must-have dvd to your MJ collection!!!

 I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!",1256515200,3,749,4.552238805970149

MJ showed off all his awesome talents when he performed in concert.

Secondly, I see a lot of people saying ""it's in horrible quality, don't buy it.""
And that is just not true! please DO NOT let the ones saying that influence your buying decision~

* take this into consideration: This was recorded in '87, yes they could have remastered it; unfortunately they didn't, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable . So it's more of vhs image quality which isn't that bad folks!!

I've had this DVD for a while now and have played it NUMEROUS times with no problems.

I played it as soon as I got it and I was mesmerized by this concert performance. This is wonderful in that it shows Michael in his element and does not do a lot of panning to the audience. It captures him at his best which is how I prefer to remember him and I loved the duet with Cheryl Crow- very well done. You can't go wrong with this one if you are a fan of his talent for it is showcased here beautifully. Best purchase I've made in a while.,1253923200,,560,3.878260869565217

If you see Michael Jackson Live in Bucharest, you will see an astounding difference between the two DVDs. This isn't worth the money. Take Dramamine for motion sickness before watching Michael Jackson Live in Japan. Perhaps I'm being harsh but this dvd offering appears to be a 1980's VHS recording, then a transfer to dvd without remastering of any kind. This could have been great but I sense it was rushed to market to capitalize on Michael's passing, and that is insulting to Michael's legion of lifetime fans worldwide, and to Michael's amazing talent and legacy. Anyone who knows Michael's productions will see this for what it is, in comparison. I can't tell if this was a professional recording at the time. Michael is his beautiful self, and that's the best part of this dvd. Even shoddy production can't make Michael look bad, on his first solo tour, Bad!",1253491200,2,1191,4.804878048780488

6266853,5,B00IJYQV7A,"In 1987 Michael Jackson released his third studio album on Epic records, ""Bad"" which would go on to sell 32 million copies worldwide. He had previously toured with his brothers (as The Jacksons) in 1984 and was planning a world tour in support of his newest album, which would be his very first tour as a solo act. The Bad World Tour began in Japan in September 1987 and would continue into early 1989.

This DVD features the very first date of the tour, which includes many of the songs performed at The Jacksons' 1984 Victory Tour, as well as the first two single releases from ""Bad."" Songs span Jackson's entire career up until that point beginning with the Jackson Five's 1969 debut ""I Want You Back,"" then onto The Jacksons' 1978 hit ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"" and Michael's solo singles like 1980's ""Rock With You"" and 1983's ""Billie Jean."" Its an excellent performance and this DVD is definitely worth its relatively low asking price.

I read in other reviews of this product that this DVD doesn't have the best picture quality. This may be true, but I wouldn't say that the quality is poor, but average to above average. When it comes down to the music, this DVD is top-notch. Seeing that the film was recorded 22 years ago this month, I would say that it is a pretty good bargain at $8.00. I have seen other Michael Jackson concerts with much better picture quality, but this one is truly one of my favorites, since it offers a far superior track listing to that of ""The Dangerous Tour in Bucharest (1992)"" and some of Michael's other commercially released DVDs and VHS tapes.

As for the songs/performances, here is a quick overview of each track:

1.  Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'- The opening track to the Bad tour, as well as
the 1984 Victory tour with The Jacksons is the perfect introduction to a stellar show. It is also the opening to Jackson's biggest album ""Thriller"" which also gets four more of its songs represented in the concert.

2.  Things I Do for You- An album track from The Jackson's ""Destiny"" album which is really nothing special, but it stands as one of the most familiar tracks from the later incarnation of The Jacksons/The Jackson Five (circa-1976-1984).

3.  Off the Wall- The title track to Michael's first adult-solo record is a highlight. He also performed this number on The Jacksons' 1981 Live album, as well as the Victory tour three years earlier.

4.  Human Nature- One of Michael's best known ballads/singles from ""Thriller"" is one of my all-time favorite songs ever. He performs it in a much different manner than he did in 1984, which gives the song a much more intimate quality as his vocal range really shines. This is also one of the only songs he would perform live in concert (without the aid of lip-singing) during the 1990's.

5.  This Place Hotel- The best track on The Jacksons' ""Triumph"" album of 1980 is Michael's first real super hit of the '80's, which paved way for ""Billie Jean"" and ""Dirty Diana."" If it were included on either the ""Off the Wall""
or ""Thriller"" albums I am sure that it would have gone to Number One on the charts. His vocal performance of this track (minus his brothers) is much more aggressive this time around and his dancing has definitely progressed over the last couple of years since ""Thriller.""

6.  She's Out of My Life- Another ballad. One of his best adult-vocal performances besides ""Human Nature"" and ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You."" This was always a true highlight of his concerts in the eighties and beyond.

7.  Jackson 5 Medley- A great showcase of his early days with his brothers during the 70's Motown era. The real highlight is ""I'll Be There.""

8.  Rock with You- This song went to #1 in 1979 while Michael's ""Off the Wall"" and ""Destiny"" albums were both in heavy rotation in disco clubs and skating rinks everywhere. A sign of things to come.

9.  Lovely One- Another track/single from The Jackson's 1980 LP ""Triumph."" Written by Michael and his younger brother, Randy Jackson, this track is a great example of Michael's singing ability and vocal progression into the eighties. The performance here isn't much different from the Victory tour version.

10. Workin' Day and Night- Another album track from ""Off the Wall,"" which calls for a costume change. This funky-R&B number is very much in the same vein as ""Things I Do for You"" and ""Lovely One."" Its a great example of the late 1970's Jackson sound.

11. Beat It- The first hard-rockin' track of the concert. Michael's vocal and dancing ability is in full swing as he shows off his red-buckle jacket, black loafers and white socks. There is also a blistering guitar solo by touring guitarist, Jennifer Batten.

12. Billie Jean- The true highlight of the night (DVD). The sequined glove ... the hat ... the moonwalk, the rest is history. Jackson's best known song is also his best performance on DVD and in this concert. Overall, his performance is much more electrifying than during the Victory and Dangerous tours, due to the new arrangement of the tune. His moonwalking at the end is really great.

13. Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)- A great way to end his ""Billie Jean"" performance and one of The Jacksons' greatest hits of the 1970's. He also add-libs a few lines from ""Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough"" towards the end of this extended jam between the King of Pop and his touring band, which includes Sheryl Crow.

14. Thriller- The live debut of his last single from ""Thriller,"" which was surprisingly left out of the Victory tour's set list in 1984. As with ""Human Nature,"" ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',"" ""Billie Jean"" and ""Beat It"" this is a real highlight of Michael's abilities as a performer.

15. I Just Can't Stop Loving You- The first of only two songs from ""Bad"" to appear in the concert. It is a duet between the then-unknown, Sheryl Crow and Michael. It was also the first single pulled from the ""Bad"" album in 1987. Like ""She's Out of My Life,"" this ballad is a true highlight of Michael's soulful singing.

16. Bad- Mike shows off his new ""Badder"" look. Jackson wears the black leather buckled jacket/pants he wore in the short film while he belts out the now iconic lines, ""Your Butt is Mine!"" Its a great way to close the concert and a hint of things to come. He would follow-up ""Bad"" with 1991's ""Dangerous,"" another aggressive album. This concert marks the ending/beginning of an a new era for Michael Jackson, as his solo career would eclipse that of his career with The Jackson Five.",1251936000,3,6479,4.649737302977233

I felt people took advantage of his kindness and love for children.

This is a great concert video, and from a female perspective it's nice to see him when he still had some meat on his bones...LOL.

Lots of Michael dancing his booty off, and not the fainting, screaming, and promoting his self proclaimed king title crowd shots from Europe. This is the Michael I remember seeing in concert.

6266868,4,B00IJYQV7A,"I have 3 MJ concert DVDs- This show, Bad, Live in Japan, Dangerous in Bucharest and History in Munich. Having seen all 3 shows, I can tell you this is a great show in terms of vocal performances. Mike sings more in this show than the others. However, the trade-off is more singing=less dancing. I definitely missed the dancing but I didn't say one time ""man I wish he would really sing this one."" He sang every song. His voice is so special and always makes me smile. Gems on this dvd include the performances of Off the Wall hits Shake Your Body, Workin Day and Night, Rock With You and Off the Wall. I also really liked watching him perform Bad. I like that song and he did not perform it at the newer shows. This DVD definitely deserves a place in your MJ video collection. The video quality is not top-notch, but honestly, it didn't bother me at all. The low price makes this a no-brainer. While you're at it, get Dangerous in Bucharest and History in Munich---if you can find it!  These 3 shows display MJ's progression from an exciting performer to OMG YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!!  History is the best show by far, but it's mostly lip-synced and when he does sing, his voice is shot.  But the dancing!!! OHHHH the dancing! Dangerous is the middle ground between Bad and History. You can see elements of both. I can only dream of how incredible This Is It would have been. I hope there's a party in the movie theaters when it hits the silver screen!

6266870,2,B00IJYQV7A,"Ok well...to start off, I will point out the positives of this feature film (not that many). Number one: Michael Jackson is in it...and anything he's in is absolutely outstanding! Number two: He sang all of the songs!
Here comes the bad...and I don't mean the song! For starters, the cover of the DVD doesn't even look like Michael Jackson, it's probably just some guy pretending to be him! (Jealous people of the world). Next, the cover and back of this DVD looks like it was created by a child on word processor and printed on an everyday printer! Not good. I thought the back of this case would be better than the front until I flipped it over(gagging), and realized that one of the songs was misspelled! Instead of 'Shake Your Body', it said 'Shake YOU Body'. I was livid! There were three pictures on the back of this DVD, which appeared to be copied and pasted from a less than average website! The pictures were all stretched out and contorted. I was devastated. So in my fury, I inserted the DVD into my player (why would I do this? I don't know). The scene selection screen had tacky music and a background that could only be described as anti-Michael Jackson. It looked like Woodstock gone wild. As I chose a scene, I found that the graphics were fuzzy and appeared to be created on Windows Movie Maker! I was dealing with my anger, hoping to be calmed by the beloved song 'Billie Jean'. However, when Michael began to recite the song, the song title came up as 'Billy Jean'. WITH A Y! Michael would NEVER want Billie to be spelled with a Y! I smashed myself! Finally the credits were amature and half Japanese! It took away from the magic and delight! As you can see, the King Of Pop was disgraced by this video! I warn you: PLEASE, it's for your own good to NOT purchase this DVD! This comes from real MICAHEL JACKSON FANS!! We love him, and this DVD made us mentally unstable!

It appears to me to be a Japanese TV shoot with all angles from the audience to the stage itself. Close-ups of MJ putting heart and soul (as in ""She's Out of My Life"")into his performances make this a wonderful piece of MJ concert history. Remember this was the BAD tour, it has some songs not in later tours, like ""Heartbreak Hotel"", love it! This Bad concert is not as complicated or extravegant as the Dangerous or History concerts. Dangerous is probably the greatest concert ever conceived.

I've seen Michael perform a song or two live over the years, but other than the very short  Destiny Tour on VHS, and the lip-synched Dangerous DVD, this is by far the best Michael concert I've ever seen. Michael sings very well with absolutely no lip-synching at all. The band is tight, the dancers are on point. Michael looks good and healthy, and is in fine form. Great energy from him throughout, especially given the often rapid pace of his dancing and singing. Set list was the best I've ever personally seen from him. Dangerous Tour DVD had too many songs I didn't really care for. This is the Michael I know and loved. I will admit the picture quality could have been better. There were a few brief minor gliches and lasted maybe a split second. For the most part everything looked good. There were enough close-ups for me personally. No 5.1 audio, but the stereo sound played well on by tv and sound system. Well worth the relatively low price far as I'm concerned. My dvd player has been wearing it out since I got it. Might even watch it again tonight. I especially loved his show closer performance of the song Bad. He knocked-it-out-the-park on that song, even going down close to the audience. There is another dvd of this concert that cost about $20. Packing looks better online, but not sure if the quality is any better. Money is tight right now, so I bought this one. I'm glad I did! I simply believe any true Michael fan should have it. This is Michael at the top of his game pure and simple. Proved to me that few, if any, did it better.

This is actually a Great quality bootleg from a Japanese performance from the 1987 tour. It was one of the earlier shows from the tour hence some if not most of the same setlist as the victory tour a few years before.

The picture quality is a little dark (its from the 80's) but i would definitely rate this DVD higher than the OVERRATED bucharest dvd. Lots of shots of michael and the band with multiple camera views.

Audio Quality is very crisp and clear. Don't expect the most current up to date 5.1 dolby digital sound or DTS. This is a VERY good stereo sound which sounds GREAT.

If you are a MJ fan PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy this DVD of michael in his prime in terms of life perfomance.

If only there was an official or high quality bootleg floating around of a later bad tour to compare setlists and quality of the show. (Later Bad tour setlists contained more songs from the Bad album)",1248307200,20,1011,4.244791666666667
6266879,1,B00IJYQV7A,"I recently purchased this-tsk,tsk,tsk-Amazon. I am HUGELY disappointed!! This is the first product bought from you that I am TOTALLY unhappy with!! I gave 1 star just because it's Michael Jackson.  Other than that, I'm glad I only spent just under $8.00. I almost bought the $19.90 one, but after reading the reviews, it's apparent the only thing changed is the cover.  QUALITY is NONEXISTENT--Hardly ANY CLOSE-UPS on Michael (most footage is from so far, I could barely make him out)--I realize it's first tour, but isn't there ANY way to remaster it??  The DANGEROUS TOUR IN BUCHAREST is the BEST I've seen to date!!  Going to do more research from now on before buying ANYTHING!!!",1248134400,3,683,4.862068965517241
6266880,4,B00IJYQV7A,"This is concert footage from that Bad Tour which wasn't clear when I ordered the DVD. I was skeptical when I read that it was bootleg footage. This is not the case and while the quality isn't 21st century standard quality, it is representative of the late 80s. All in all I am very happy with Live in Japan. It shows Michael at the peak of his career and was a lot of fun to watch. I definitely would recommend this to any Michael Jackson fans!",1247875200,14,444,4.174418604651163
6266881,4,B00IJYQV7A,"Looking around this is the only recording that seems to have been put on dvd for the bad tour.  No the picture quality is often not great, and combined with the horrible cover packaging it has every feel of a bootleg.  However, for $7.50 which is less then most e bay bootlegs I'm not going to cry about quality too much.  The sound is good, and getting to enjoy Michael singing live makes it worth it for me.

If you are looking for just one live Michael Jackson show go for Live in Bucharest, but if you are looking for something earlier with more old songs and live singing, you'll really enjoy this one too.",1247875200,6,611,4.28695652173913

Depending how much you love MJ, I have mixed feelings about this concert.  Sometimes when I watch it I just love seeing him like that and other times I just think the dvd is not up to par.",1523491200,,346,4.276923076923077

8642737,5,B00IJYQV7A,I love anything Michael Jackson so I am pleased with purchase. Video quality is fine and the cover doesn't match the concert that is shown but I don't really care. It could mislead some into thinking it's a concert from his later years (mid 90's) when it's really the late 80's. The packaging was fine and I received it on time.,1502323200,,328,4.39344262295082
