I hate when movie makers give a movie the tag line ""based on true events"" but then they take no care and consideration in even getting the story close. While the story of Sarah Winchester herself is true, and it is believed that a medium told her that the spirits of people killed by the Winchester rifle were haunting her, this interesting true life tale has little to do with the film.  Neither is the story of her house which she continued building and adding on for years until she died.

Instead, we are presented with three bad actors with bad haircuts - a father, mother, and daughter - that move into the Winchester Mansion for a few days.  It's not really explained why they move into the house. Like most haunted house films, they start finding newspaper clippings and photos that might help them explain the haunting, but this is just barely tapped into.  The best of these explanations is a photo of a man with a small chalkboard hanging around his neck; he's deaf and uses the chalkboard to communicate.  But like I said, the directors and writers of this film barely scratch the surface.

Instead, we're taken on a dark, frightful run around the house as the parents panic when their daughter goes missing. Odd spirits with facial deformities appear and attack the parents, even Sarah Winchester herself attacks policeman who show up after the father calls in his daughter's disappearance.  The special effects are horrible, actually there weren't really any special effects.  Just running around and panic, scary music, and bad lighting.  Let's not forget the horrible script.  Some of the conversations between the actors don't even make sense, responses seem delayed, and some lines are just downright stupid.

The family is aided by a paranormal investigator - another horrible no name actor with bad hair - who lives down the road who shows up to help them find their daughter.  He explains to them the types of spirits there are and their purpose, and then magically all of his explanations start to take place, including his own demise (which is a laugh if that).  After an hour of running around and not really accomplishing anything, the movie comes to a sad climax and everything is resolved.  At this point, the film comes to an actually nice and surprising close which was a lot like The Others or The Sixth Sense.  I actually liked the ending and thought it was pretty clever and it's just too bad the rest of the movie didn't live up to it. Overall, the film is stupid, predictable, and a big let down.  The surprise ending came too late, or not soon enough if you decide to sit through this trash.",1255824000,16,2737,4.694560669456067
3909755,3,B002D3E03K,"3-D glasses in place, we settled ourselves down for a bit of a fright---we thought.  Who wouldn't love to visit the spirits inhabiting the haunted Winchester House, in 3-D. Instead, what we experienced was a blast from the past, which led to uncontrollable giggling and a room filled with rib-splitting comments. The hairstyles, and setting, looked straight out of the late 60's.  The only give-away, that this film wasn't from lost archives, was the daughter's iPod. Unfortunately, the acting was about as bad as some of the low-budget horror films, playing the outdoor screens, of bygone years.  Only then, we didn't complain; it was a dollar a carload.

As bad as we found this movie to be, credit is due for the moment of backward, time-travel, and the campy feel of the film, hence the three stars, but I suspect this was not the producer's intention.  Or, maybe it was; they couldn't have been serious.  Could they?  I would recommend a viewing for baby boomers who would like to reminisce about the past, particularly with a group of friends who also experienced some of the early 3-D movies.  It could be fun with the right crowd.

The 3-D option was rather disappointing, though.  It was dark and hard on the eyes and did not add any scare factor.  We actually had to turn it off before the end, because it became headache inducing, when our eyes suddenly started crossing from the strain.  But, many of the new 3-D films have been sub-par, the exception being Coraline, which I consider the best of the recent bunch, and quite eerie, in a subtle way.

Unless you're a serious collector of retro, or retro type horror films, I'd recommend you rent this one first, and give it a go.  I also think everyone that refuses to answer the doorbell on Halloween should be made to sit through this film. That would teach 'em!",1254787200,13,1825,4.6625

This has some elements to behold.
Scary moments aplenty,Make-ups on victims of the Winchester Rifle are great and spooky.
The cast is very real in their performance and story comes to logical conclusion.
The 3D version is OK,Im not sure if it added something.
What was great was this-Based on truth and WHO hasn't been to Winchester Mystery House ?

Wow factor,Is how come didn't use the Real House instead of CGI mockup ?You know copies are gonna end up in gift shop,LOL.

If you have a all region 3d player you can buy this film on blu ray 3d like I did off amazon.de ,  It was followed by 'the haunting in salem' also shot in 3d. By the low budget c class company 'The Asylum' .  That company makes very low budget films with at least usually limited experienced actors.  As opposed to a d level movie which is a bunch of people who have experience at all making a film.  This film is a very tame film , with no gore , or nudity , so I don't know why it's 'uncut' ,  the budget is small here and I mean very small , but it is a traditional ghost story with a twist at the end.  The real Winchester house is not in southern California ,  it is farther north and it really exists.  It's a mansion , not a house. It's huge.  It's a tourist attraction and not a residence anymore.  The place is worth visiting as Sarah really did build false doors and rooms and such till she died to keep the ghosts of the dead away from her. In the 1800's,. The Winchester gun company is still one of the best today!  this film gets three stars from me because it was filmed in 3d. and the 3d blu ray from Germany is good viewing wise.

This California tale is supposed to have some connection to the Winchester rifle heirs and the victims of the rifle during the Civil War. Oliver Winchester, the inventor of the rifle in 1866 lived his whole life in Connecticut, go figure.

The script was rather good and drops clues to the unexpected twist at the end. You didn't know they were clues until they went back and showed you. What killed this film was the acting and directing, and maybe the overuse of the whoosh sound for ghost movement. I had to laugh at the crying scene of Annie played by Jennifer Smart. It was really bad. The introduction of Harrison Dent (Tomas Boykin) was likewise weird. It isn't until the very end you realize the film wasn't half bad, too bad you hadn't enjoyed any of it.

However, when an evil supernatural force abducts their daughter, they discover why the house deserves the reputation that it has as one of the most haunted places in America.

I'm inclined to agree that the acting is horrible in this movie. At times, it is somewhat laughable. If you can get past that, the movie isn't too bad. Like I've said before, I've seen far worser movies. It's a good ghost story. I, like another reviewer here, think that people felt cheated because the story never really had anything to do with the actual house. Heck, the house in the movie looks nothing like the actual house. If you've read any of my reviews, you know that I'm very outspoken and will tell you the truth. If a movie is bad, it's bad and I won't mince words. The movie, though, isn't as bad as it might seem reading the reviews here. Personally, I thought the movie was okay. I like it. It was entertaining although I felt it might have fared better if they made no mention of the Winchester House at all.

THE HAUNTING OF WINCHESTER HOUSE is yet another take on the ""I see dead people"" plot device popularized by Herk Harvey's classic frighter,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CARNIVAL-OF-SOULS/dp/1559409002/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CARNIVAL OF SOULS</a>&nbsp;(1962). ""Winchester"" fails miserably for technical reasons more than anything else. Nearly the entire 82 minutes is dark, with most scenes filmed through a heavy blue filter. The audio track, which ideally supports a story and heightens viewer emotions, doesn't fit on-screen action and is annoyingly overloud. As for pacing, I couldn't abide endless ""creeping around the scary house"" sequences and fast-scanned through them, which shortened the experience to less than an hour without obfuscating the plot. Acting was OK. (two stars)

Not recommended.

The Haunting of Winchester House would play fine as a half-hour or hour long episode of a horror anthology show. It is paced for that length of program, and the story arc can be supported for that length of time. As a full-length feature, it is weak.

It seemed like they were having fun, and I actually had fun watching this, and making fun of this, which was half the fun!  Great ending, that's all I can say on that.  Not really sure why they made any reference to Winchester House at all, I think they could have just left that out and they probably would have had a better movie.  It seems most people felt ripped off because it had nothing to do with the actual Winchester House, except stealing the story of the legend of the house to make this movie.  Really wasn't necessary though.  The photo of the people in the 19th century had much better hair styles than the caretaker family did.

So how is the movie?  It's not very good.  Horrible acting, lighting, direction, partially redeemed by an unexpected twist at the end.  There are some unintentional laughs as well.  Rent..don't buy.",1267228800,,366,5.11864406779661
3909796,1,B002D3E03K,"Shannon is ABSOLUTELY right. I hate when I get suckered in by the DVD titles/Cover titles. Its good if there's NOTHING else on TV & you're bored. When did they wreck?What happen to their baby?? Was the black guy a ghost or alive? I am dumbfounded by the fact they kept saying  ""little girl"" when in fact she was a TEENAGER-she's not a little girl. I complained & the video store gave me a store credit. If anyone knows please email me:)",1264291200,,436,4.317073170731708
3909797,5,B002D3E03K,"Not sure what some of the ""bad"" reviewers are looking for in a ghost story, but this film certainly has them and mamages to entertain and scare at the same time. Creepy, dark atmosphere, ghosts around every corner, and great soundtrack with haunting effects. The ending will catch you totally off gaurd. I liked it! In fact, it's one of the better horror flicks i've seen in a while. The film is inspired by the incidents surrounding the supposed ""ghosts"" at the real Winchester mansion. You know the story of the Winchester rifle family who claim the souls of those killed by Winchester guns returned to haunt the mansion and all who dwell inside. Turn out the lights and enjoy....remember, it's only a movie..isn't it?",1263772800,6,720,4.768
