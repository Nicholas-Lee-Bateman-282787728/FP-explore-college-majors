without a strong Leila the set suffers greatly.",1504396800,,191,4.333333333333333

8686558,5,B00P6NRRIY,Beautiful performance. The voices were very good. This performance has been criticized by some for minimalist staging but this not an opera that requires a spectal. What it does require is voices that give full quality to this glorious music.  This performance has it.,1484352000,,268,5.090909090909091
8686559,5,B00P6NRRIY,"We must thank the San Carlo Opera for this traditional production of this beautiful opera. In spite of the nice costumes and excellent singers the production is somewhat boring because of poor acting, awful choreography (specially in the first act). and poor scenography. However it is so
much better to see and listen to a traditional production however poor than to suffer the indignities of modern productions like the trailers in this set
show.",1468540800,3,448,5.0675675675675675

8686561,3,B00P6NRRIY,"Musically, way better than the first DVD version from La Fenice. The four principals are really outstanding, but forget about any kind of acting..  At times the fact they do not even look at each other when they are supposed to bee singing to each other is unintentionally hilarious. Great orchestra, conductor and chorus. Visually, totally boring.  It seems as if they had no budget for scenery.  Gorgeous costumes, probably with the intent of making viewers forget there is nothing else onstage.  The ballet is totally ridiculous: it looks like an exercise group.  Another one to be heard, not seen.

The postmodernist scholar Eve Sedgewick coined the term 'homosocial desire"" to describe attraction between men that can only be expressed through the body of a woman.  Examples abound in opera, most notably in this one (another is Don Carlo, sort of).  And that is precisely the reason that the Zurga/Nadir duet fails in both DVD productions.  It is not treated as what it really is: a love duet!",1464220800,7,999,4.898809523809524
8686562,4,B00P6NRRIY,It is the better of the two on DVD. My main complaint is that the signature  tenor/baritone duet 'Au fond du temple saint'' is sung only in the first act. Bizet did not finish the opera himself.,1442534400,2,194,4.243243243243243
8686563,5,B00P6NRRIY,"This ids an excellent production of Les Pecheurs des Perles. Bizet did not quite finish this opera. He had to submit it before he turned 26. So he submitted it, not quite complete on the last possible day. So the ending is open to interpretation. I regard the EMI recording with Nicolai Gedda as deserving to be called definitive. I think the finale here achieves the same meaning as the Gedda recording. Les Pecheurs des Perles is eclipsed by Carmen. And yet it abounds with beautiful melodies. This is only the second time that Les Pecheurs has appeared on DVD. Yet DVDs of Carmen are almost tuppence a ton. Have no hesitation about buying this one; and if you have to choose between this and the Venice recording, my opinion is that this is really a lot better.",1439337600,11,764,4.543478260869565
8686564,3,B00P6NRRIY,"This one wins over the earlier DVD from Venice on Dynamic, mostly because of the sound.  I recently went back to that disc to compare it with this San Carlo di Napoli bluray and there is no comparison between the muffled sound in both PCM2.0 and DD5.1 of the 2004 production and the gorgeous lossless audio surround we have here.  I had recollected that the earlier performance was acceptable except for the tenor.  However, maybe we were being unfair to him.  Actually, the San Carlo production would be an acceptable CD version especially for the work of the Lla, Patrizia Ciofi and the orchestra and conductor.  But I just couldn't stand watching it.  The high definition accented the cheesiness of the sets (except during the last act), costumes, acting and video direction.  Showing the ordinary house ladder that was used to mount the Buddha head was unforgivable.  I have never seen this opera live but I think it is possible to mount a convincing production.  For now, there are enjoyable versions on CD.",1432166400,7,1012,4.803468208092486
