2697531,5,B000FAOAX8,"I was way too young when they first started showing Russ Meyer films
i know my dad was going to see them,because he would occasionly bring
back the pocket brochures,and i would get a peek at them,i would even
cut out the ads in the movie section in the newspaper. The first time
i saw the ads for.""Supervivens"" there was no turning back,i was a fan
for life,i collected nearly every printed ad or interview that had
anything to do with Russ Meyer,and when i was eventually old enough to
purchase the VHS copies(of which some i still have).I can only say that
they did not dissapoint. Buying the universal format DVD player was a
no-brainer. Now i have all of the great Russ Meyer films at my fingertips
whenever i wish to look at them. But i know what my dad was going thru
now. I have twin daughters,both will be 11 soon,and i keep such material
in my locked video cases. Thanks Dad,and thanks Mr Meyer too.
May you both R.I.P",1328313600,2,927,4.364161849710983
2697532,5,B000FAOAX8,"Worth every penny for fans. Includes interviews with producer, writer, sometime-actor, cameraman, director Russ Meyer himself and many of his actresses. Also, a few director's commentaries on the films which allow you the unique opportunity to watch them ""with"" Russ Meyer.

Is it art or is it porn? Having now seen every available Russ Meyer movie and read every book related to him, I can confidently say that his work is not porn. These are merely beautifully filmed and edited adult dramas and comedies driven by the theme of sex. Lots and lots of gorgeous big-bosomed women in various states of undress lusted after by lots and lots of incredibly stupid, determined, square-jawed men.

Every Meyer film is an exaggerated take on life, and that's the point of it. Or to put it even more simply, it's fun. Captivating, hilarious, baffling, unforgettable, ESSENTIAL fun.

Breast in Peace, Russ.",1307577600,5,896,5.04054054054054
2697533,5,B000FAOAX8,"Great transfers, very nice set, I wanted to write this review for people who think they can not watch region 0  DVD's or get this set because they are in the U.S or elsewhere, and share the fact that many DVD players can be made region free quite easily, I simply looked up the models of my DVD players players on google, and found simple remote unlocking codes for both my Marantz and Pioneer players and now both play any region DVD's without issue.",1282521600,12,451,4.369047619047619
2697534,5,B000FAOAX8,"First off, if this set were widescreen, I'd give it 5 stars, but it's not, so I gave it 4 (EDIT: I didn't realize that these were actually filmed mostly in the standard or full screen ratio when I wrote this review, so I've added a star since). That is my only real gripe with this otherwise crucial set of Russ Meyer films. I guess another minor gripe would be that they didn't package the films in chronological order, but that probably won't bother most people.

If you're a fan of unique films, you have to get acquainted with Meyer, pronto. If you haven't seen his films, quit wasting time, you don't know what you're missing. This set is totally worth the 80 bucks I dropped on it (it has kept me entertained for over a 2 weeks so far). It's not all-inclusive, but it does have most of his films, and the only ones that most people really want to see. Aside from Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, the few films omitted are minor works. To be honest, I don't think anyone would have missed Pandora Peaks if it had been left out.

So here's what you're getting into: Sometimes funny, sometimes frightening, always unique live action ""cartoons"" featuring hand picked actors and actresses who best represent the overly libidinous characters populating the warped universe Russ Meyer lives in. These films will shock and amaze you. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll shake your head in disbelief. The good guys always win and the bad guys end up getting whats coming to them.

The films, to follow a general trend, started out as almost plotless ""peepshows"", then got more interesting in the mid sixties with dime store novel plots involving salacious and seedy characters in rural or southern locales. The films got gradually raunchier and even more cartoon-like into the seventies, culminating in his last three ""real"" films (2001's Pandora Peaks is generally not counted in Meyer's timeline by fans). You must see these films to believe them.

The set is awesome, even though it's mostly in fullscreen. My personal favorites in the set are Mudhoney, Faster Pussycat, Supervixens, Up!, and Beyond the Valley of the Ultravixens, though there are other gems included here as well. Fans of these may want to seek out the excellent Beyond the Valley of the Dolls as well (not included here). There are director commentaries, cast interviews and featurettes sprinkled throughout the various discs in the set. Lots to see here. I really cant recommend this set enough.

Just make sure you have a region free DVD player if you live in the states. This set is actually worth buying one for. Maybe one day RM films will authorize another all-inclusive set in widescreen in all regions. Until then, this region 2 is a great diversion.",1269302400,15,2725,4.752642706131078
8159052,5,B000FAOAX8,Great collection to educate yourself on a cult film maker that gave the audience what they wanted. The editing and directing is surprisingly done well.,1480464000,2,151,5.08

8159055,5,B000FAOAX8,"Awesome collection of classic Russ Meyer! Very well packaged, great art on the discs themselves as well as the outer box. Lots to love in this box set for sure. You will only need to add a few single features to this set to have a very well rounded Russ Meyer collection. This set is not in the US Region 1 format. And I do not own a multi region DVD player. But I have checked a few of these out on my PC and they work fine. But this collection is all the prodding I will need to be purchasing a new player so I can view these in all their big screen glory.  If you are a fan of Russ Meyer films or any films produced for the Drive In Era and your on the fence about purchasing this set. Just bite the bullet and Do It !  You won't regret it. I don't see these being around much longer.",1403481600,2,787,3.8518518518518516
8159056,5,B000FAOAX8,"This collection ranges from the sublime (FASTER, PUSSYCAT, KILL! KILL!) to the ridiculous (MONDO TOPLESS) to the obscure (EUROPE IN THE RAW) to the somewhat questionable (Seriously, what is up with UP (1976?).

As a general picture of his filmography (BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and a few of the early 'cuties' are missing), this is as close to definitive as a Meyer fan is going to get. Recommended.",1400716800,,404,4.771428571428571
8159057,4,B000FAOAX8,"First of all, this is a fantastic collection and a great value.

Regarding the so-called value--you have to watch the price on this as it fluctuates wildly! I got it for a mere $77, but I've seen it as high as $120. As I write this review it is not even available as a ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" purchase at this time, which is how I purchased it only a week and a half ago. Why this is all over the place like this is a wonder. But for what I paid, it was only a few dollars more than the 3-title Vixen Collection, which is going for $63. Add Faster Pussycat for $35, and you're over $90. And here you're getting all of them except the classic Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and the obscure 7 Minutes. [Note: BVD is available for a mere $13 as part of a 4 disc set called ""Classic Quad Set 9"" here on Amazon and is well worth it, as the ""official"" release goes for a whopping $50--damn they love to stick to the RM fans and right where it hurts!].

But beware: these WILL NOT play on a USA store-bought stock dvd player that has not been modded to be all-region. I have a toshiba dvd player/recorder that I got 2 yrs ago and a panasonic bluray player that I just got just 4 months ago and these won't play on either. I rolled the dice and hoped they would work, but did not. I'm going to end up ripping and re-burning them to dvd+r's on my iMac to erase the region encoding until I get a region-free player. If you want to start watching these right away, make sure your player can be modded to all-region, or buy one that definitely can or already is. I searched online, but could not find codes for either of my 2 units--such is life.

This issue aside, the films are exactly as advertised: pure Russ Myer! What more can be said?
I only deducted one star (reluctantly) because those cheap bastards at Arrow Films don't have this available in good ole' USA region 1 format and force us to jump through hoops to see 'em with this muliti-region BullS***. For movies that are 100% pure Americana in origin, theme and everything else,, this is re-goddamn-dicoulous...

Anyone have any suggestions for that region-free player I'll be getting?",1393804800,5,2134,4.300995024875622
8159058,2,B000FAOAX8,"Better than any of Hollywood but....in my book Hollywood is a benchmark with zero stars so here it goes.
Primitive, outdated, not sexy for a start. Some imagination, some skin, reflect firmly on 50th era.
Yes, I don't remember any flick I value from 50th but I remember these.
Like with most of the movies the main problem with these is that social issuies never shown or discussed openly.

8159059,4,B000FAOAX8,"How can you buy 13 Russ Meyer's films for about $10 each?  Too good to be true?  This collection has everything including the earlier nudie works that are seldom seen, everything except his studio efforts, ""Seven Minutes"" and ""Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls,"" the 2 instances in which he wasn't his own producer/distributor.

And here's the 13 films:

2001 Pandora Peaks
1979 Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens
1976 Up!
1975 Supervixens
1973 Black Snake
1970 Cherry, Harry & Raquel!
1968 Vixen!
1968 Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!
1967 Good Morning... and Goodbye!
1967 Common Law Cabin
1966 Mondo Topless
1965 Motor Psycho
1965 Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!
1965 Mudhoney
1964 Lorna
1963 Europe in the Raw
1962 Wild Gals of the Naked West
1961 Eve and the Handyman
1959 The Immoral Mr. Teas

The two seminal films in his oeuvre: ""Faster Pussycat"" in which his rural nudie aesthetic blend perfectly with his thriller/action sensibilities, making the next run of films rise to the next melodramatic level (particularly ""Common,"" ""Good,"" and ""Finders""); and then the classic ""Vixen!"" in which he's loosened his hold on strict narrative and the buttons on his stars' cleavage and which ushers in the classic daffy sexy era of Meyer that lasted to 1979 and the last desperate gasp of ""Beneath.""  Finally (partially due to hardcore) he became rather culturally obsolete as a filmmaker.",1376956800,6,1386,5.057017543859649
