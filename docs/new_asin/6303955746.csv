7857206,5,6303955746,"The first Christopher Nupen profile of Segovia is a kind of collage w/ performances, scenary, interviews, tutorials, and musical philosophy. This film is now available on dvd w/ ""Song Of The Guitar"" as ""In Portrait."" Nice insights into the Maestro packed into a 52-minute viewing that will warm you up for your daily classical guitar practice schedule. Get to it!",1176854400,,363,5.066666666666666
7857207,3,6303955746,"The video is quite good , whenever we see SEGOVIA playing or talking about his live or the history of the guitar, but unfortunatly not enough- we could have done without watching sceneries of Spain or the donkey walking in the country side !
I would like myself find a copy of the other video showing SEGOVIA playing : it is a 52 minute film from Christopher Nupen called "" The Song of the Guitar "" It was printed on laser disc, but I wonder if it is available on VHF or DVD ?
Thank you for your answer

7857208,4,6303955746,"This video consists of interviews with Segovia at his home and throughout the countryside and villages of Spain in 1969. Three full pieces performed on film,the rest are excerpts or background music narrating shots of the Spanish countryside. Also , footage of a child and donkey ,etc. illustrating a piece from ""Platero and I"" as Segovia reads from the poem of the same name in Spanish. The coverage of his playing is good , as are the interviews. This has better film coverage and sound of the playing than the ""Segovia Legacy"" video. video is 1 hour long. Worth the money.",973036800,5,575,4.702970297029703
7857209,5,6303955746,"This extraordinary video lacks about a relationship of the repertory of pieces performed by Maestro Andres Segovia. I detail them next for all those that are interested:
(1)-LA MAJA DE GOYA, by Enrique Granados (arrangement Miguel Llobet).
(2)-SARABANDE from Lute Suite I, BWV 996, by J.S.Bach.
(3)-GAVOTTE EN RONDEAU, from Lute Suite IV, BWV1006A, and Violin Partita III BWV 1006, by J.S.Bach.
(4)-FANDANGUILLO from 'Suite Castellana', by F.M.Torroba.
(5)-LA FILLA DEL MARXANT ('The Merchant's Daughter'), a popular Catalonian song, arranged by Miguel Llobet.
(6)-STUDY Lesson 26 from 'The Complete Works for Guitar' Vol. 2 page 52 (Chanterelle 802), by Dionisio Aguado.
(7)-RECUERDOS DE LA ALHAMBRA (music in background) by Francisco Tarrega.
(8)-LA ARRULLADORA, Lullaby from Suite 'Platero and I' by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.
(9)-SPANISH DANCE Nr. 10-in G by Enrique Granados (arranged by Miguel Llobet).
(10)-LA MAJA DE GOYA (music in background), by Enrique Granados.
It would be very interesting, for all the fans to the classical guitar, could provide all Videos of Andres Segovia in DVD format.",944784000,7,1103,5.610778443113772
7857210,2,6303955746,"The video started out great with Mr. Segovia playing a couple of peices but quickly degraded to just scenes of the Spanish country-side with only the music being played in the background.
If I was interested in seeing  Spain, I would have bought a video to that end.
I wish I could return  this tape but unfortunately you cannot return opened video  packages!!!
Extremely disappointed, expected more playing and less  scenery.",940291200,22,426,4.957746478873239
7857211,4,6303955746,"This video is shot at Segovia's home when he is at the ripe old age of 75.  The maestro discusses classic guitar history, technique, and luthiers, and the video has plenty of footage of Segovia playing music by Bach, Tarrega,  etc.  As a guitarist I appreciated the director's decision to show Segovia  as he played the various peices, unlike some other videos that frequently  cut to scenes of Spanish countryside while music is being performed.",912816000,4,446,4.8933333333333335
