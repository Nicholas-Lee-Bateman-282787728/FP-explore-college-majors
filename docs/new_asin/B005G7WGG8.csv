4689596,5,B005G7WGG8,"Really beautifully done! Brilliant, yet subtle. The acting is excellent, with believable and touching performances. Well written and directed. Twisty, and fun when things are revealed. Funny, and unusual, and good fun. Best movie I've seen all year.",1338163200,3,249,5.578947368421052
4689597,5,B005G7WGG8,"Very funny! It was fun, novel, exciting, and anything except boring. I have never seed a movie quite like this one and it was refreshing.",1334016000,4,137,4.52
4689598,5,B005G7WGG8,"By day Griff has the usual office job where he is bullied by his workmates and is only ever visited by his brother who tries to make Griff conform to society.  By night Griff takes on the alternate persona as the town's superhero protecting the city streets.  Griff is invisible to the world until he meets his brother's new girlfriend, Melody who turns Griff's life upside down with her eccentricities that only match his own.

Griff the Invisible is a very touching story that blends the lines between reality and illusion that is definitely worth at least one watch and I would highly recommend it.  The story isn't too similar but if you like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind this movie is definitely worth a chance.",1325203200,5,725,4.68503937007874
4689599,4,B005G7WGG8,"Liked it, not loved it. But was worth watching. It seems the director was very good at making it seem to watcher that the lead really did have a high tech set up and super abilities, but in the end you see his psychosis for what it is. Good movie.",1324857600,,247,3.96
4689600,5,B005G7WGG8,"This movie has great acting and a great story. The two main characters are the type of people we don't normally get to see in films, and this was one of the reasons I loved the movie so much. Another thing that stands out to me is that the characters retain these weird personalities right through the end of the movie; which is kind of comforting. (In other movies you might see this type of character being changed into a 'normal' person by the end of the movie).

Ryan Kwanten really did a great job and was completely believable as a strange and meek type of person. I was very surprised at his performance since I'm used to seeing him in True Blood as a completely different type of character.

The music in this movie is OUTSTANDING. I kept finding myself making mental notes to look up what artist sang this song or that song. I wish there was a soundtrack I could buy from this movie.

I definitely recommend this movie if you are tired of the same old same old romantic comedies coming out of Hollywood lately.",1324598400,3,1019,4.380952380952381
4689601,3,B005G7WGG8,"SPOILER ALERT!  I don't try to give away the story plot, but in any review there is a chance of learning things you may not want to know.

This movie was very disappointing to me.  I'm not exactly sure how it could have been done better, but luckily that isn't my job.  I didn't understand what was going on at first, which, for me, led to the inability to enter the fantasy world and enjoy the film.  And then once I did understand what was going on, it was all taken away from me and I was left feeling empty.  The movie tries to make up for it at the end, but it was too little, too late.

The cast is marvelous, and had this somehow been done differently I think it could have been a good movie.  But as it is, it is just weak.",1321920000,3,731,3.958904109589041
4689602,4,B005G7WGG8,"This story brings up again the interesting concept of fitting into the real world vs. escaping from it; especially, when the escapism takes over.  Where the protaganist, meaning well, finds solace, by truly portraying a super-hero.

Griff(Ryan Kwanten), by day, lives a mundane, tortured office life.  Bullied by a co-worker, pressured by his brother to conform and normalize his life, and living in depressed obscurity, he maintains, by night and in his constant thoughts, what he conceives as his actuality- Griff the Protector.  That's plot line number one.

Second, his struggles with the bully.

Third, and definitely, the richness of the movie, his encounters with a young, troubled in her own way, scientist, the girlfriend(Maeve Dermody) of his brother, who takes a not to be put off, persistent, interest in Griff.  He's a super-hero loner, who formulates his own gadgets, for the most part real, and doesn't have time for a love interest; moreover, one that his sensible, real mind knows will probably discover, spoil, and make fun of his secret.

The actors are good, playing the two awkward people, who don't fit in the world very well, who discover each other, after much bumping around the obvious before hitting upon it.  That part is a wonderfully compelling idea.

The story, however, doesn't totally satisfy.  A bit disjointed, it bounces between mild humor, drama, fascination with the characters and what Griff will do next, but overall, everything carries quite a bit of depression.  Griff vascillates between almost creative genius to messing up just about everything he attempts.  The writers stress the negative heavily through the movie until the end, and even then, one realizes there's a lot of issues unresolved.

It ends quickly, will love conquer all, will Griff retain his childlike dreams, and some real practical questions left up to the viewer.  In summary, this Australian film, is for the most part an interesting character study to watch, especially, for those of us who can understand, having felt as such at times, being out of step with the world, maybe as a child in school or even as an adult, and wishing someone would come along and discover and take an interest in us.

There's some violence, language, no sex or nudity.  Kids won't like it- adult themes, slow moving at times; it's psyche not action based.  I give it a solid, stiff-necked 3 stars; my wife likes it a lot and gives it a 4-5 stars because she says it makes you step back and question why we perceive everyday life the same way we do.  My advice to Griff is the same one many of our dads give us: don't give up your day job!",1321833600,,2635,4.841517857142857

4689604,4,B005G7WGG8,It's a good movie. I was impressed with Ryan Kwanten. I'd only ever seen him in True Blood so didn't know what to expect. I now have a lot more respect for him as an actor.,1409270400,,172,3.8055555555555554
4689605,4,B005G7WGG8,"Albeit a bit quirky, I found this dramodey quite entertaining. I saw the trailer while watching another movie and decided to give it a chance.",1404432000,,142,4.72
4689606,4,B005G7WGG8,"Here's a quirky, touching little film that accomplishes so much more than just about every instantly forgettable multi-million dollar blockbuster. Griff is an Australian office worker, shy & awkward, who lives a fantasy life as a superhero -- much to the frustration & concern of his older brother Tim, a well-meaning but clueless member of the social mainstream. Melody is Tim's sort-of date, who speaks of living in a bubble where she can talk to people, but never truly communicate with them ... until she meets Griff, who is clearly a kindred spirit.

Simply on the level of a sweet romantic comedy, this works wonderfully. The two leads are attractive, and the viewer feels for them, waiting for that moment when mutual love makes itself undeniably known. Griff has to deal with an obnoxious office bully & his own social anxiety; Melody appreciates her loving parents but knows they simply can't understand her (though her mother surprises her & the viewers as well toward the end of the film).

But there's a lot more going on here, at least for those with eyes to see: questions of what constitutes both normality & reality -- the tendency to pathologize eccentricity, or a different experience of the world that doesn't harm anyone else -- the rigid & often unforgiving nature of the conforming mainstream. Yet it doesn't shy away from the possibility that our two young lovers may be dangerously past the point of simple eccentricity, either.

In a deleted scene, Melody talks about the billions of realities that exist within each human being, in the universe of the individual mind. This reminds us that everyone, including ourselves, never experiences the world around us precisely as everyone else does -- there are always shades & tones that are peculiar to us. The key is striking a personal balance between the social definition of Normal -- which is ultimately arbitrary, an agreed-upon majority opinion more than anything else -- and maintaining the wonders & mysteries of the person within, and living an authentic & personally meaningful life. Again, the film touches on the dangers of going too far in either direction. If Griff & Melody are sharing a lovely illusion, many of the so-called ""realistic"" people around them have their own illusions as well -- but theirs are socially acceptable.

A film like this is a delicate thing. Just a bit too much, and it slides into twee mawkishness. But that doesn't happen here. The filmmakers are in control of the material, steering it lightly but firmly, and trusting in the charisma of their two leads. It's a film that's a joy to watch in its affirmation of offbeat love ... but it also offers some food for thought that lingers after the credits. Highly recommended!

Note: fans of ""The Science of Sleep"", ""They Might be Giants"", and the classic ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""Miniature"" might well find much to love in this film.",1402358400,,2894,4.8979591836734695
4689607,5,B005G7WGG8,"This movie is adorable! Ryan Kwanten from True Blood is so cute and Griff, the average guy who has a secret life as crime fighting super hero. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",1383782400,,193,4.542857142857143
4689608,3,B005G7WGG8,"but I was never able to see this film in it's entirety.  Griff is a regular guy, fighting crime.  I gave it a 3 because I could not fairly evaluate it because I never finished watching it.  I WAS a little confused for a while, as to whether or not the dude was nuts.  I think the filmmakers did this on purpose.  I would gladly sit down and watch it all the way through.",1370822400,,370,3.945945945945946
4689609,4,B005G7WGG8,"It's tough to relate how excited I was getting while watching this. Is it as good as I think it is or is it somehow connecting with something in me that doesn't allow me to see its faults? One way or the other I liked it tremendously.

Here's the scoop. Griff is a very mild mannered person by day, performing some nondescript job in some nondescript office. He has an array of sophisticated monitoring gear to keep an eye on his neighborhood. If he sees evil doers doing evil, he gets into his superhero suit and takes care of business. It seems he's had some trouble with this in the past and his older brother is present to make certain that doesn't happen again. Griff falls for his bro's kind-of girlfriend, and she for him. Doo-doo hits the fan.

Where to begin. The characters. I liked the way they were written. Griff is so mild mannered during the day it hurts seeing him get the smelly end of the stick at the hand of his workmate. Melody. She sees the world differently than most others and she feels alone because of it. But she sees the real Griff and knows this might be her shot at happiness. Griff's brother Tim means well, but he doesn't realize what a dweeb he really is. Melody's parents mean well. They have good hearts, but they don't have a clue where their daughter is coming from. I liked the way all these people interact with each other.

Then there's the story. This unfolded for me really well. I liked the way the plot was doled out. It kept me in the game, but the third act sprouted some dark things that scared me. How much of this was really happening and how much was delusion concocted by people who simply cannot come to terms with the day to day existence we all have to put up with? Yes we're happy the two have found one another but at what expense? This was directed well enough and there were some great tunes in the soundtrack, but the writing and acting are the stars here.

Again. I cannot say how much I enjoyed this movie. Maybe it isn't as good as I think it is but it's good for me.",1366588800,4,2030,4.278645833333333

I received the item in a timely manner and as described by the seller. The DVD was New and in great condition.
A refreshing look at perception and reality. Ryan Kwanten did a amazing job with his role in the film.
I am familiar with him from True Blood and it was great to see him take on the role like Griff in Griff the Invisible.",1366156800,,488,5.777777777777778

4689612,5,B005G7WGG8,"Lov superhero movies, Netflix had this and stopped weirdly half way through and just needed to watch in its entirety. Good fun quirky film",1351728000,,138,4.791666666666667

8471263,5,B005G7WGG8,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.  Especially like the subgenre where flawed but basically good hearted people try to become superheroes...and struggle at it lol  But really, who hasn't ever wanted to have special powers and defeat the people who bully you in life?  Great empowerment fantasy.

Related to Griff so much.  His relationship with his brother hit home so much with me, though I can't remember if Griff was older or younger, and the typical trope is for the older brother to be the ""normal""/successful one and the younger is the ""mess"".  Wish more movies would flip the script on that.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,2,1647,4.693379790940766
8471264,5,B005G7WGG8,"This is a really great movie, it's not a Kick Ass style average guy putting on a superhero suit and fighting criminals movie, although if you stumbled onto it after it just started on TV or something you might think so at first. It's about a socially awkward man who has the mindset of a child at times but is also at least in his mind a genius. He doesn't have any friends and believes this is so, as he would put them in danger since his destiny is to fight criminals in his neighbourhood. However his older brother has moved back from Adelaide after a past event we don't learn much about but has something to do with his crime fighting and that he also was being bullied where he used to work. His brother has through a friend gotten him an office job and randomly pops in with surprise visits to Griff's home to keep encouraging and somewhat demanding he keeps acting normally. He interrogates Griff about his job and Griff hides the fact he is constantly being harassed and tormented by a bully and the girl he is having an affair with, while the other office workers turn a blind eye, including his so called brother's friend. One day the brother mentions, Melody, a girl he's met, and brings her by on a surprise visit. Melody doesn't seem to like the way the brother is talking about her as if they are about to get married, and even less how he talks down Griff. She sees something in Griff, she doesn't see his behaviour as wrong and tries to strike up a friendship, but Griff is worried his brother won't like it and that Melody will be in danger from Griff's calling to fight evil criminals if he lets her hand around. Griff has his own plans to deal with the office bully, and while at home is trying to perfect his suit that turns him invisible to help him fight crime.

The movie could so easily have failed many times, but it just doesn't. It is helped by the fact that both Griff as well as his brother's girlfriend Melody are very likable characters. It could probably have been slightly longer and included a few scenes where the non main story isn't quite tied up. I would have liked to have seen a comeuppance scene for one particular character for example. But even without that, Griff the Invisible was still a great film.",1469059200,,2246,4.386091127098322
