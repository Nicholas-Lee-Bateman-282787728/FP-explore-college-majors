Anyway, Watch beautiful patagonia and you will never forget. I love living edens...glaciar bay video and this video will be in special place in my heart too.",1080000000,,394,4.642857142857143
7873526,3,6304525745,"Of all the ""Living Edens"" episodes, I liked this one the least.  It opens with quite a bit of footage of bull elephant seals fighting, and some of them are quite bloody when it's over.  We also see baby seals get trampled in the fracas.  I realize that these things do happen in nature, and that Patagonia is a harsh place where competition for survival is very intense.  As a high school or college science video, this documentary has its place.  However, I would not show it to small children in school or at home.  I give it a PG-13 for disturbing gore.",1007337600,3,556,4.349514563106796
