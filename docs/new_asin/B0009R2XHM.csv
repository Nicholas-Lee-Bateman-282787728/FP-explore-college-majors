2313432,5,B0009R2XHM,"""Part History, Part Mystery- Although little is known about Sacagawea, her story has captivated the nation.

Sacagawea's contribution to the Lewis and Clark expedition has made her one of the most honored heroines in American history. Numerous statues have been erected in her name, and more mountains and lakes have been named for her than any other Native American woman.

This one-hour documentary explores the life and legend of Sacagawea as told through the rich opal history of the Shoshoni, Hidatsa, and the Nez Perce tribes, as well as the historical account taken from the journals of The Corps of Discovery. Travel in the footsteps of Sacagawea as the film takes you through the wilds of the American frontier.""",1239753600,,721,5.050420168067227
2313433,3,B0009R2XHM,"This documentary uses paintings, statues, and modern reenactments to describe Sacagawea and her importance to Lewis and Clark's expedition.  In the same way that an African-American man (Morgan Freeman) narrated a documentary on the anti-Communist attack against Black artists, a woman (Susan Sarandon) narrated a work on women's pursuit of the right to vote, and a gay man (Harvey Fierstein) narrated a work on Harvey Milk, Rita Coolidge, a partially Native American woman narrates this documentary on Sacagawea.  The work interviews scholars, tribal members, and even one ancestor of Sacagawea.  The work is diverse showing women and men, Natives and Caucasians.  However, the Lewis and Clark expedition was triracial, not biracial.  Clark's slave named York was important too, but his name, shamefully, never comes up in this work.

One interviewee said Sacagawea was an equal to her French husband Charbonneau, then another interviewee refers to the man as Sacagawea's ""owner.""  The expedition is portrayed as the accomplishment of equals, yet Lewis and Clark call Sacagawea ""the Indian woman"" and almost never call her by name.

This work has much music in its background.  Some of it sounded like the work of the group Enigma.

The work says that more places and monuments are named after Sacagawea than any other American woman.  I love it when I get the golden dollars with her supposed image on it.  This work does a great job in explaining her importance to the expedition and to American history.",1190505600,11,1507,5.156378600823046

8065477,2,B0009R2XHM,Attempts to re-write history. Flimsy at best. A waste of money.,1481414400,,63,4.818181818181818
8065478,3,B0009R2XHM,"I wanted to like this more, because the subject matter is such an interesting part of history.  But I found it difficult to stay focused.  There was too much overly dramatic assumptions/questions about what Sacagawea felt at various points.  Some of that is okay, but especially the first part of the film was overloaded.  I have to admit that the narrator also wasn't my favorite for a documentary, being too emotive for my taste.",1470787200,,431,4.783783783783784

The DVD was not as complete as the book I read (over 1300 pages) but who knew what really happened to her and the end of her story ( whether true or fiction) was also very interesting!!",1440374400,,245,4.083333333333333

8065485,5,B0009R2XHM,I enjoyed the references to the journals and the map showing the journey that was taken by Sacajawea with Lewis and Clark. She was a brave woman and should be respected and admired as a true heroine in our great nation's history. I would recommend this documentary to anyone interested in learning more about this part of history.,1358726400,4,330,4.706896551724138
