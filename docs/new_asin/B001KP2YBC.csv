3667357,4,B001KP2YBC,"This was one of the better Harlequin movies. The two main actors were believable and actually had some chemistry, however, the bad guy wasn't as believable.  It was still a very watchable movie.",1422316800,,194,4.878787878787879
3667358,5,B001KP2YBC,"I really liked this one. It had everything romance, a little suspense, and some humor. I thought the main two characters were cute together and had on screen chemistry. It was so far the best Harlequin movie I have seen.",1313798400,4,220,4.525
3667359,5,B001KP2YBC,"Recipe for Revenge is one of the best Harlequin Movies made. I would say that it along with Treacherous Beauties are the best. Both movies give you a touch of everything from Romance, Suspense, Mystery and Action. The movie keeps you watching it from beginning to end. I also think that Corbin Bernsen is an awsome actor. If you like the whole package you need to see this movie because it gives it all to you. I was very pleased with my purchase of this movie.",1242086400,8,461,4.372093023255814

8315672,5,B001KP2YBC,Loved it! Great cast. The shine on this is the chemistry of the actors and some of the scenes in the film. The tempo is chaotic and mellow...serious at times but often playful. What happened to the leads in this film?,1521936000,,217,4.317073170731708

8315677,5,B001KP2YBC,"She was only suppose to help a friend by cooking for her. Letting the boyfriend think that her friend made the meal.
It's one meal where the meal didn't settle so well.
Romantic suspense.",1507680000,,187,4.529411764705882
8315678,4,B001KP2YBC,I enjoyed the story.  The acting was good but sometimes over the top.  I would have like to see more suspense.  Overall it was good though and I enjoyed the film.,1505692800,,162,4.161290322580645

8315680,2,B001KP2YBC,"Sorry, I could only make it through the first 25 minutes of this movie. It wasn't terrible, but it sure suffered from mood swings! One minute the tone and music were off-beat and quirky, and then POW...there's a murder. Whaaat? Corbin Bernsen was charming as usual, but the lead actress is just awful. I can see how the plot could work well as a book, but as a film it just goes wrong.",1503446400,,385,4.287671232876712
