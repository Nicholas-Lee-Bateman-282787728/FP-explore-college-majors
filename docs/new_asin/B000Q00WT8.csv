8193960,2,B000Q00WT8,"I bought this for Cassandra Cat, which is difficult to find. The film is enjoyable, but the transfer to DVD is just about the worst I've ever seen for any film. Buyer beware! First of all, this is widescreen film that has been reduced to 4:3 ratio without any panning. Often you're not sure what you're looking at because the important part is cut off. It looks like the source material was a bad videotape. The image is fuzzy and hard to see, the color comes and goes, and there are nasty compression artifacts. Internet video looks many times better. I agree with another reviewer that the dubbing is well done.

In Carnival Story, the sound vanishes for 10 minutes. You're better off looking for this one for free on the Internet since it's apparently now in the public domain.",1301184000,,780,4.571428571428571

8193962,2,B000Q00WT8,"I purchased this dvd because I was curious about Cassandra and as a backup to my copy of Carnival Story. I would give Cassandra a 3 , for quirkiness but Carnival Story has been badly cut--about 25 minutes of the film are missing--not a good buy if you're a Steve Cochran fan as I am.",1241654400,,283,4.163636363636364
8193963,5,B000Q00WT8,"This was one of a handful of two-film DVD's I found in a discount-store bin. The first movie, ""Carnival Story,"" was an entertaining circus drama starring a radiant Anne Baxter.

At the end, I let the player go on to the second movie, ""Cassandra Cat,"" which I expected to be a mere curiosity, especially since the titles were clearly foreign (Czech), and the color was somewhat faded and variable (I think it was in Eastmancolor or a similar process - the color in such films made before 1983 has tended to deteriorate over the years).

""Cassandra Cat"" (Az prijde kocour) was directed by Vojtech Jasny, and had been awarded a Special Jury Prize at Cannes. It is dubbed in English, and this, in my opinion, was very well done. The dubbing is synchronized with lip movement as closely as possible, and the voices and inflections match their respective characters quite convincingly.

But the fantasy element is what enchanted me. ""Cassandra Cat"" is utterly unlike any American pop-culture film; I was transported to a different world from the start. The music (by Svatopluk Havelka) truly is, as one reviewer characterized it, ""sublime.""

I won't even try to describe the storyline, which is replete with satire and allegory. It is a morality play, albeit a quite surreal one at times. The riot scene following the pantomime is incredible, an almost psychedelic tour-de-force. A lovely pastoral scene with gorgeous visuals and baroque-like music provides a touching contrast. And there's so much more.

This daring film is all the more remarkable because it was made in 1963, when the visual arts still operated under the restrictions imposed by the party and the government, some five years before the short-lived ""Prague Spring.""",1190419200,4,1728,5.006968641114983
