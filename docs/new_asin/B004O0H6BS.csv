4436522,5,B004O0H6BS,"I'm not sure why people don't like it, I thought it was great and possibly even funnier than many of their videos.  Maybe they hated the changes to the intro?",1279497600,,158,4.266666666666667
4436523,4,B004O0H6BS,"Afetr the disappointment that was Abe and the Amazing Promise, I was beginning to become concerned that the creative minds behind Big Idea in its current incarnation (basically, Mike Nawrocki and some hired guns) weren't up to the task of continuing the legacy Phil Vischer and Nawrocki had created.  Thankfully, Pistachio shows there may yet be life left in the franchise.  Surely the best-looking Veggies episode ever in terms of the animation, the story is solid and the jokes are funny and in character for the most part.  Khalil does steal the show, to be sure, but Larry and Bob and Junior are enjoyable as always.  The ""Extreme Re-Do"" gag is clever, especially since it doesn't really change much about the look of the countertop (blue walls and throw pillows), and Qwerty's upgrade seems logical given the technological advances we've seen in the past few years.  Also, it's a relief to see the return of Mike Nawrocki as the co-writer of the latest Silly Song; the last few Silly Songs were fairly weak with the exception of ""Sippy Cup,"" and I was pleased to see Nawrocki returning to arguably what he does best - write Silly Songs (with Kurt Heinecke, who's also back on board for the rest of the music).  All in all, Pistachio teaches a valuable lesson, though I'd argue that the payoff - the moment where Pistachio chooses to listen to his dad instead of insisting on his own way - isn't as strong as it could have been.  Still, I'd guess this one will find its way into our DVD player on a regular basis.  Nice job, Big Idea.",1279065600,2,1538,4.608058608058608
4436524,3,B004O0H6BS,"While I wouldn't be as harsh as some reviewers, this is certainly not the best effort they've made. The story is fine and the message is fine, it's just not that creative or done with the excellence you might expect. I enjoyed this more than my wife (she would probably give it only 2 stars).",1270944000,11,292,4.327272727272727
4436525,2,B004O0H6BS,"In one of their most recent videos, the VeggieTales crew addressed the theme of listening to your parents. Junior Asparagus takes on the role of Pistachio, a boy carved out of wood who has a hard time listening to his father, Gelato, a wood carver who had no children of his own (played by Larry the Cucumber). My favorite character is the return of Khalil the Caterpillar who plays Cricket, a caterpillar who isn't a cricket (I thought it was funny). From the picture and little bit of the setting, you are correct to assume that this is a retelling of the Disney classic Pinnochio with a VeggieTales twist.
For those of you who have been fans of VeggieTales from the very beginning (Where's God When I'm Scared), you will immediately notice something different... they remixed the introduction! The song, itself, hasn't changed; it's just a bit different. In addition to changing up the theme song, the VeggieTales set gets an update courtesy of a Veggie version of Extreme Makeover. Not only that... Qwerty has been updated to! Qwerty can talk and receive video emails!
It was a bit of a shock to see all the changes, but overall, I think that these are positive changes. One thing that would be really neat is for the video emails to be real ones that VeggieTales receives through one of the many social media outlets like Facebook or a blog or something like that.
As for the story in this video, I found it a bit simplistic and overly moralizing. They did clearly make the point that it is important to listen to parents even though I think it was overdone. I do give VeggieTales kudos, though, for trying to go beyond the ""obvious"" theme of truth-telling when it comes to the story of Pinnochio. Children will still enjoy this video. I also found it fun to see throwbacks from the Jonah movie like Khalil, the whale, and even some deja vu of being inside the belly of a whale.",1270425600,,1883,4.57396449704142
4436526,5,B004O0H6BS,"As I have already stated in previous reviews, every one of the Veggie Tales DVDs are absolutely wonderful. My five year old loves them as well as all my other grandchildren. They all watch and enjoy the DVD's and I especially love the fact that these DVDs are far and away the best teaching tools I have found to teach the values I want my family to have: honesty, faithfulness, friendship, dependability, caring, sharing,",1268870400,3,422,4.716216216216216
4436527,5,B004O0H6BS,"One of the best Veggie Tales ever! The animation was top-notch, the humor was better then usual (I laughed out-loud many times) and the lesson was excellent for children. The importants of listening to wise parents and in this case a father in a child's life. The retelling of Pinocchio was a great storyline for the Big Idea group and they didn't disappoint with a very clever rendition. I liked how they skirted around the whole fairy thing with Madame Blueberry. Very cute. Kahlil (the caterpillar named Cricket) steals the show with his humor and loyalty. The Silly Songs With Larry was a good one with the Office Supply song done as a obscure Broadway musical. Qwerty gets an upgrade but Bob still rolls his eyes.

My four year old loved the entire DVD. I highly recommend it too.

4436546,4,B004O0H6BS,"Pistachio is the VeggieTales where Qwerty gets his upgrade and the VT gets a spiffing up in Extreme Re-Do Crying Edition.  We then move along into the veggie-take on the classic tale of Pinnochio, starring Larry as Gelato, Pistachio's (played by Junior) dad.

Gelato is an adoptive father to three obedient ducklings whom Pistachio (with his tendencies towards rebellious willfulness) is clearly contrasted once he is carved.  Nobody made him, he doesn't need to listen to anyone, and he can be the boss of himself regardless of instructions from his father/creator.

The classical story of Pinocchio is set up with a simple re-telling of the parable of the lost sheep.  This parable is, of course, mirrored by Pistachio's own straying from the flock of his family and Gelato's un-ending quest to recover him.

While VT comes short of fully tying this story of redemption to God the Father's unending love and pursuit of His children, the depiction of fatherly love in the face of disobedience is still moving.

The Pinocchio retelling is very gentle, if not entirely accurate.  There is no turning into a donkey (which some of my kids insisted should be in there).  The meatball bros certainly weren't in be original, but I think they are funny.  The emphasis is slanted more towards filial obedience than honesty, though that's in there as well (with he nose and all).

The CG is lovely with detailed wood textures.  The silly song ""Where Have All the Staplers Gone"" just isn't as catchy for kids (and big kids) as they normally are, though there is some nice, if melodramatic, harmonizing.

The DVD also includes the standard audio commentary track, a discussion guide, art gallery, and ""Larry Visits a Marionette Theater' bonus feature.",1453075200,,1740,4.958620689655173

4436582,4,B004O0H6BS,"VeggieTales still seems to be going strong.  This series of mostly straight to video releases uses talking and singing vegetables to teach Christian morals to kids.  There is usually enough humor to entertain parents as well, hence the reason this single guy keeps buying and enjoying them.  Their latest release is Pistachio: The Little Boy That Woodn't.  As you might guess, it's a spoof on Pinocchio.

The first things long time fans will notice is that they've changed the theme song slightly.  It's not a big enough change that most people will be upset, but after being the same for almost 20 years, it is definitely noticable.

Okay, moving on to the actual episode.

As usual, we start on the countertop as co-host Bob the Tomato is returning from a vacation.  While he was gone, Larry the Cucumber had the crew from Extreme Re-Do: Crying Edition in to fix up the countertop.  Yes, this part was definitely for the adults, and I got a huge kick out of it.  They've also given Qwerty the computer an upgrade, and our letter of the week comes in a video e-mail.  A little boy is wondering why he should listen to his parents.  And so we roll film.

In the town of Bologna-Salami, there lives a lonely toy maker named Gelato (Larry the Cucumber).  He's filled some of his loneliness by taking in three duckling and hiring an assistant, Cricket the Caterpillar (Khalil, and it's been a long time since we've seen him).  One day, he is given a hunk of pistachio wood.  After craving all night, he finds that his new puppet comes to life.  But Pistachio (Junior Asparagus) isn't willing to listen to his father.  As a result, he winds up running from a puppeteer and being swindled at the carnival.  Will he learn to obey before it is too late?

As I was watching the story unfold, I couldn't help but regret the fact that they'd already used the Biblical parable of the prodigal son in a previous episode.  They recovered fairly well, however, by paralleling Pistachio's story with that of the lost sheep from the same chapter in Luke.  This allowed for some nice lessons in the second half about forgiveness and love.

Unfortunately, things are very heavy handed, especially in the first half.  Sometimes, they are able to slip in the lesson in such a clever way you don't really notice you are learning something.  Here, it's obvious we're being taught about obeying parents.  Now I have no problem with the lesson, especially when we remember the target audience is pre-schoolers, but I wish it weren't so obvious.

They do still get in plenty of laughs.  Just about every character is named after some kind of Italian food.  When we reach the traditional Pinocchio climax, Khalil makes some comments about his first appearance in the franchise, which was Jonah.  While nothing was as funny as the opening, I was amused through most of the show.

We do get a new silly song as well, or in this case Obscure Broadway Show Tunes.  Half way through the story, Larry and Petunia come out and sing ""Where Have All the Staplers Gone?""  It's a bit strange, but that makes it funny.

This is not one of the more memorable VeggieTales episodes, but it does still entertain.  I just wish Pistachio: The Little Boy That Woodn't wasn't quite so focused on making sure we got the moral and had a little more fun along the way.

(And as much as I'd love to take credit for the pun in the title, I got the idea from the back of the DVD.)",1430524800,,3428,4.560655737704918

They sing the songs and watch the shows on every possible media device that plays DVD's (Our TV's with DVD players, our computer, our van, etc...)  They both sing along with all the songs, and though I also hear the Veggies talking and singing all day - I still enjoy them as well.

4436684,4,B004O0H6BS,"Our family loves Veggie Tales, we own them all.  I had high hopes for ""Pistachio,"" as I do all of them; maybe the fact that Pistachio is my favorite ice cream made me excited for this release.  It's cute, don't get me wrong.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the lesson about obeying your parents, that they want to do what's best for you.  The character names, songs, ducks, Blue Berry (hilarious)...all of that was clever and hilarioous.  However, I just wish they hadn't done a ""Disney"" adaptation.  The reason we won't let our kids watch Pinocchio is because of the fox and carnival scenes.  Of coure, Pistachio isn't even half as bad, but I still didn't like the scheming and lying parts.  yes, kids will have to deal with them someday, but our 2 to 5-year olds don't quite get that there are people like that in the world.  I answer questions for them and we talk about what God wants us to do, that some people care only about money or other things and that we need to pray for them, etc.  Still, though it isn't our favorite Veggie Tales movie (Ballad of Little Joe, Moe and the Big Exit, Noah's Umbrella, Esther, Joshua and the Big Wall...they are our favorites), it teaches an invaluable lesson.  While our kids never choose it out of our collection, it's one I'm happy to put on in the van's DVD player for our 1+ hour trips.  The songs, as always, are catchy and witty.  It's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a Veggie Tales fan.  5 stars for the lessons, 3 stars for presentation, 4 stars overall!",1308873600,4,1506,4.4489051094890515
