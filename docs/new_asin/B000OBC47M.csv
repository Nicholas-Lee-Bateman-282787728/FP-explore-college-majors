8184177,3,B000OBC47M,They almost lost me with the campy first story. But the 2nd and 3rd stories are worth the wait.,1507939200,,95,4.052631578947368
8184178,2,B000OBC47M,"Oh, they tried so hard and it was so incredibly bad.  It wasn't the subtitles, I watch many movies with subtitles.  It was the acting, the plot, the production.  I would have rated higher if it had been a college attempt.  Pass on this one.",1507766400,,240,4.266666666666667
8184179,5,B000OBC47M,"Really liked this movie! It consists of three short stories. The first one has humor and the supernatural. The end is sweet in a good way. The second is more intense and based of a Philippine legend. The third is very intense and more dark than the others. I found all three really good, but the last was the best. It was a nice progression. I would watch it again, something I rarely do. It is not in English, which to some people it's a no go. I don't mind reading subtitles, although it was not really necessary for me to do so, since movies from the Philippine are usually a combination of Filipino (which I understand a bit), English and Spanish (I'm bilingual), as is the case here. If you only know English, you can figure out what is going on without knowing the others or reading. You are warned, so please don't give it a 1 just because you don't like to read, as I have seen happen often when it comes to foreign movies.",1507593600,3,931,4.265536723163842
8184180,5,B000OBC47M,"This is a damn good series of horrors from my home country Philippines. I've tried to collect everyone of them, unfortunately I've gotten some where there's no option for ""english"" subtitles, and part 1 will never be availble, so I got most I could get that's available. This is a great collection to own for anyone into horror!",1426636800,3,328,4.672413793103448
