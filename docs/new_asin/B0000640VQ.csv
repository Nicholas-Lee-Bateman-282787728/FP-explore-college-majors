1698145,4,B0000640VQ,"Behind the Sun takes place in 1910 in the Brazilian countryside.  Even so, the movie has a timeless feel to it.  Two families have a long standing feud and the film very early on shows us a dream sequence with the oldest son of the Breves family being ambushed and shot while carrying his youngest brother, ""kid,"" on his shoulders across an open field. The shirt of the victim is hung on a clothesline.  When the blood turns yellow, Tonio, the son next in line, will be required to ambush and kill the member of the rival Ferreira family who murdered his brother.
Tonio carries out his assignment, kills his rival, and the stage is now set for the process to be repeated, seemingly in an endless cycle which will ultimately destroy both families.  Unfortunately, a misguided sense of honor has blinded both families to the stupidity and senselessness of the feud.
Only the youngest brother of the Breves family, the kid, seems immune to the craziness of the longstanding feud.  He is a dreamer and we see him pouring over a book about the ocean given to him by circus performers who are on their way to the next town to set up their tent.  The fire-eater in the circus is a beautiful young woman and the kid's older brother Tonio falls in love with her at first sight.  This complicates matters because Tonio knows that he doesn't have much longer to live.  The rival family will kill him when the blood on the shirt of the man Tonio killed turns yellow.
Except for brief moments at the circus, we experience the suffering of a family that has lost much and appears destined to lose even more.  The Breves family has no hope and no future because tradition and honor are more powerful than reason.  We don't have to look far to see counterparts everywhere today -- Northern Ireland, Palestine, Bosnia, etc.
The climax of the film is heartbreakingly sad -- no Hollywood ending here.  The kid loves his brother Tonio and wants him to be happy.  He is a dreamer and he is willing to pay the price to make his dreams come true.  His dreams and sacrifice are a means of liberation for his brother and his family and an example for all of us.  We will not soon forget him.",1062374400,4,2166,4.464467005076142
1698146,5,B0000640VQ,"This 2001 Brazilian film is one of the saddest I've ever seen.  It's set in 1910 in the cane fields of Brazil.  There are two families who live on adjourning land who are part of  a blood feud that has gone back so far in time that nobody remembers the details.
The story unfolds through the point of view of a 10-year old boy.  He is the youngest of three sons. His oldest brother has been killed a month before and his bloodstained shirt is drying in the sun.  Now that the blood has turned yellow, it is time to revenge his death.  This task falls to his beloved 20-year old brother Tonio, who, after a heartbreaking chase, murders a son of the rival family.
Now, we all know that Tonio will be murdered just as his rival was murdered.  And we know he, too, has a month to live while the bloody shirt of his opponent dries in the sun.  A lot happens though during this month though.  A traveling circus passes by and Tonio falls in love with a young fire-eating performer and wants to stop the cycle of violence.
The film was beautiful inasmuch as it captured a time and a place and a code of honor that seems cruel and barbaric.  It also captured the human spirit of the people involved in this tragedy.",1059523200,16,1207,4.254385964912281
1698147,4,B0000640VQ,"Set among feuding sugarcane farmers in rural Brazil at the start of the last century, this film is in most respects a consistently beautiful achievement.  First of all, the spectacular photography, as astonishing on DVD as in the theater, is marked by a series of wonderfully lit or darkened barren and lush vistas of the sort which linger in the memory.  The acting, too, is noteworthy for the naturalness of most of the players, the older of whom have faces rightly savaged by the harshness of the vengeance code they uphold and the narrow meanness of their lives of quiet desperation.  The younger people in the film, eager for a life of more promise and joy than that offered by the declining sugar cane trade or itinerant circus performing, are to a person physically beautiful, yet frail and vulnerable to abuse, even early death, given the limited options their lives actually afford them.
On the other hand, the film ,in my view, has a serious flaw, which is its dependence on the stereotypical character of the wise, unbelievably insightful pre-pubescent child not only to voice obvious truths none of the grown-ups see as quickly but also to provide the entirely predictable, essentially sentimental denouement.  With such astonishingly fresh realism marking the treatment of economic competition (i.e. the scene of price gouging at the sugar trading office) and family feuding (the appearance of the killer among the mourners at his victim's funeral) in the early and central parts of the film, the use of such a Hollywood or T.V.-style wise kid is both jarring and disappointing.",1033171200,3,1591,4.992452830188679
1698148,5,B0000640VQ,"The story in this film is simple: blood for blood feuding between two families in the backlands of Brazil.  If left at that, this would be a conceptually boring movie, one done hundreds of times in various locations for varying Hollywood budgets.  The glory of BEHIND THE SUN is in the presentation and transformation of a familiar precis into a visually stunning prolonged motion painting.  Director Salles has assembled a cast of beautiful actors, minimized the Portuguese dialog so that the visuals may convey the text almost solo, and has added appropriations from other art forms to make this a memorable film.  The only characters outside the feuding families are a traveling troupe of 'clowns' or a circus consisting of an older man and his senusously beautiful stepdaughter.  This nod to the ""I PAGLIACCI"" opera invests intrigue and introduces the concept of the redeeming force of love into this otherwise blighted life story of a young man doomed to die for family honor.  The photography is elegant, the acting is superb, the musical scoring is sensitively appropriate without drawing attention to itself.  This is a very beautiful, very fine film.",1026432000,24,1159,5.068421052631579
1698149,4,B0000640VQ,"BEHIND THE SUN, with English subtitles for Portuguese dialogue, is a Brazilian version of the Hatfield-McCoy feud and set in 1910. The Breves family - husband, wife, and two sons - are hardscrabble sugar cane farmers. We don't really know what the Ferreira family does - perhaps they're ranchers. Both clans have waged a blood feud for generations over a wretched piece of land better bulldozed flat for a shopping mall. Considering the endless cycle of an eye for an eye, will Tonio, the oldest Breves son, live long enough to venture beyond his family's land and experience love before the bloodstains on that Ferreira shirt turn from red to yellow in the wind and sun?
BEHIND THE SUN showcases actors that Americans have likely never seen before (and may never see again), but they're all excellent: Jos&eacute; Dumont as Tonio's father, Rita Assemany as his mother, Ravi Lacerda as his young brother (""The Kid""), Flavia Antonio as bewitching Clara of the traveling carnival, and Rodrigo Santoro as Tonio himself. Filmed in color, the movie depicts a physical landscape of magnificent austerity. Had it been in black and white, it would have been almost brutal.
The film's thematic message, I think, is that embedded tribal conflicts based on ethnicity or religion or, in this case, some overblown concept of ""honor"", are almost impossible to resolve rationally and peacefully. And the film goes on to ask - and answer, in this particular storyline - the question of what must happen before the killing is to stop. My mild disenchantment with the theme of BEHIND THE SUN is the suspicion that it's been done previously many more times than I realize, most recently to my knowledge in the excellent film NO MAN'S LAND, which deals with a more contemporary antagonism. Moreover, the script reduces the problem of tribal conflict to the simplest scenario possible and thus oversimplifies the issue beyond everyday realities. However, in that it strips the issue down to the bone, so to speak, it does manage to admirably clarify the stupidity and tragedy of such discord. BEHIND THE SUN is a film to be admired, but not one to be seen for light entertainment.",1010534400,18,2159,4.917808219178082
1698219,4,B0000640VQ,"It's no Central Station (Central do Brasil), but this movie is a good one. I'm a fan of Brazilian cinema, and I'll be adding this one to my list of favorites. It's a touching movie about a young guy caught in the middle of a family feud. His brother has been killed and now the weight of his family's honor and tradition..etc, becomes his burden to carry. The movie is basically about how he chooses to deal with the situation. For anyone studying the portuguese language, the portuguese in this movie isn't very hard to understand.",1180483200,,532,4.552083333333333
1698220,4,B0000640VQ,"This was a captivating movie, with beautiful filming that captures the awesome, rugged beauty of the Brazilian sertao.  And the story was as captivating and satisfying as it was conventional.  What is remarkable about this film, beyond the beauty of the imagery, is the bittersweet ending, that leaves you both relieved that the outcome was not what was expected, but that also was as sad and tragic as a story could be.

Although this movie was based on a novel by an Albanian writer, it fits well in an established genre of Brazilian story-telling, the stories of the sertao.

The only thing that seemed a bit unnecessary to my imagination was the indication at the beginning that the movie occurred in 1910.  Given the transcendence of the story, this was not necessary.  This movie could have been set in 1879, 1910, or 1928.  It doesn't really matter - it is a mythical, fabulous pre-modern sertao that is the setting, not any particular time and place.",1178928000,2,958,4.7696969696969695
1698221,5,B0000640VQ,"This is a beautiful, little known film.  It is not full of spectacular action sequences but is full of quiet, natural beauty and the depth of human emotions and desires.",1178928000,2,169,4.633333333333334
1698222,5,B0000640VQ,"Striking images all around, 'Behind the Sun' shows how a good picture can let you smell the air of the place, the breath of the people.  Walter Salles ('Central Station' 'The Motorcycle Diaries') tells a story that resembles Greek dramas, with its simplicity and strength, but it is the picture's sheer beautiful visuals that makes 'Behind the Sun' a boon to every filmgoer.  In short, watch this.

It's in 1910, in Brazil, in the middle of nowhere.  Two families are feuding with each other, according to their peculiar rules.  If one goes down, another member of the family revenges his death by killing the killer only.  Thus the life goes on.

Among one of the family, we see the brothers -- younger Paku and elder Tonio.  They work hard to make sugar, using the old machine and two cows, with their silent sad-eyed mother and very strict father.  And the day finally comes when Tonio is ordered to kill: the spilled blood has turned yellow.

The bloody cycle of death is briefly disturbed when a beautiful circus girl comes to the near town.  Or is it to be disturbed?  Will Tonio choose another way of life?  And what does Paku do?

You may say the plot is melodramatic.  It is, sure, but the power of the story cannot be dismissed so easily.  Walter Salles succeeds in creating the atmosphere of the place, and despair and hope of the characters as well, all of which are so compelling.

Also helped by the good acting from Rodrigo Santoro (in 'Love Actually' as Laura Linney's love), the film is about those characters and images. like 'Central Station.'  For all its slightly conventional storytelling (and very powerful one), 'Behind the Sun' remains a gripping experience all throughout.

The story is inspired by a novel 'Broken April' written by Ismail Kadare.  The film changed the original's location (in Alvania) to Brazil, and was shot in the really desert places where the sun scorches from the deep blue sky onto the red rocks.  (It is said that the cast and crew had to travel from the nearest hotel to the location more than 200 km. everyday.)  And see Vinicius de Oliveira, as the family member rivalling Tonio's, who was the little boy in 'Central Station'",1108425600,9,2179,4.693931398416886
1698223,5,B0000640VQ,"Walter Salles will probably best be known to American audiences for his recent film, ""The Motorcycle Diaries"", yet ""Behind The Sun"" is a must see for anyone willing to learn about ""The Other Brazil.""

Behind The Sun is set in Brazil's arid, drought-stricken region , known as the Sertao (located in the northeast).  A region where thousands have died because of its notoriously harsh conditions, the Sertao is the antithesis of the stereotypical image of the country: a lushly green paradise whose expansive rainforest seemingly never ends.  Perhaps the Sertao, with its almost hateful environment, presents the perfect backdrop for a blood-drenched feud between two hateful families.

When Tonio's older brother is murdered by the rival Fereiras, his father calls upon him to fuffill his obligations and defend the honor of the family; that is, murder his brother's murderer.  And this Tonio does, but in doing so, he only contributes to a never-ending cycle of violence, ""where the dead command the living"".  For by becoming a murderer, Tonio himself has sealed his own fate; now he is a (literally) marked man.

The only thing that can interrupt this cycle is a female circus performer, who enchants both Tonio and his younger brother (the narrator of this film), and who provides Tonio with an escape from both the violence and the rythyms of the cane harvest.

Behind The Sun is a well-acted, well-directed film about revenge and redemption.  For these merits alone it would be worth purchasing.  As other viewers have noted, however, the real gem of this film is the cinematography, which is some of the most beautiful I have seen.  For those who have difficulty visualizing the Sertao, think of Arizona or the Badlands, and you will have something close.

Behind the Sun is a moving film, and it clearly demonstrates that Brazilian cinema is at its peak now.

1698224,5,B0000640VQ,"As all movies from Walter Salles this one is great. What makes this one even better than his previous ones is the camera. You can hit pause anytime and you will see a great picture.
The movie shows a part of Brazil, the Serto, which is completely unknown to most people, but has its own beauty.
The actors a re unknown ones, but they are great.
If you are interested in movies which are not typically (stupid) Hollywood you should definetly get it!

1698226,4,B0000640VQ,"What kind of view could one expect from Behind the Sun?  Perception is obviously distorted.  From space, the sun is a hot fiery ball of yellow and red - an interesting contrast to the yellow globe that lights our day, and a unique use of symbolism in the movie.  Sacrificing their children in the name of vengeance, the principle characters fight a losing battle for ""honor.""  Honor that is the only remnant of a dying culture, and the only thing left that gives meaning to life.
The cycle of killing and vengeance is ultimately superceded - not by the principles alone, but by providence in the form of a visiting female circus performer.  The performer offers vision, hope, and love to a pair of brothers doomed to a future of despair.
The major parts of the movie - acting, scenery, cinematography, all come together in a masterful way to augment an otherwise abstract story.  In all, this piece represents an extraordinary work.",1077321600,4,932,4.722222222222222
1698227,3,B0000640VQ,"But alas, I only like it.
Firstly, let me say that this film is absolutely gorgeous- quite honestly frame for frame one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Visually stunning, I felt like pausing and just staring at the palette of colors, the scenery, and the beautiful people- and that this reaction may be a problem.
I can't help feeling that the story, a simple revenge fable, should have been stronger, or the scenes stronger. Alas, in the end, it was prettier than it was deep. It's meant to be like a short poem, able to give a handful of emotions. Instead it plays about like a small story in really neat handwriting, on very fine perfumed paper.
As a dvd, well, its typical for Miramax. The film is there, nothing else.",1075075200,6,736,4.45925925925926
1698228,5,B0000640VQ,"To be honest, I only rented the film so that I could swoon over handsome Rodrigo Santoro after watching his brief, but memorable role in the romantic comedy ""Love Actually"".  Little did I know how good this film was.  I didn't mind the subtitles because they were clear and non-complex.  I loved hearing the language.  I don't know; there's something mysteriously alluring about Portuguese; it has this smooth, almost rhythmic flavor about it.  I was thoroughly entertained by the little boy they called ""kid"" aka ""Puca"" (played by Ravi Ramos Lacerda);  he's basically a kid wanting to drown in the world of his fantasies but has to uphold these responsibilities of labor jus like the rest of his family.  I found him to be sweet, assertive, and pure comedy.  All the roles were praisingly convincing and held my attention the whole way through.  I couldn't get over how young Rodrigo looked even though the movie was taped but only two years ago.  hehe...young, but oh so adorable :o).  He doesn't say much, but...sometimes, words just aren't necessary.  Neways, I think the film's great.  Not one metaphor or streak of symbolism seemed out of place; not one character seemed a bit too exaggerated or too thin in personality.  I really liked this film.  Honestly?  I really did. =)

7960229,4,B0000640VQ,"A friend recommended this movie, as his family was one of the protagonists back in the 1910s, and the story was of such a futile and wasteful tradition of revenge and vendetta, with the very best young men from both families being sacrificed for nothing, I thought the acting and cinematography were wonderful. It made a very difficult subject at least watchable, and you can empathise with both families, despite the stubborn patriarchs causing such sorrow.",1506988800,,458,5.0394736842105265

The cinematography is very well done and mixes superbly with the creaking soundtrack.  The sequence in the beginning where Antonio is chasing down his prey through thickets is captivating.

Behind the Sun is a slow tale that begs the patience of a viewer.  You allow yourself to be drawn in by vengeful circumstances while you await the brutal consequences the early action has set in motion.  It is what happens while waiting that drives this sorrowful movie.  Without spoiling it for others, I'll leave it in the hands of the innocent kid telling the story.  It is the kid who brings a charm and normalcy to what otherwise can only be defined as an abnormal cultural tradition.  Some cycles beg to be broken.",1398038400,,858,4.666666666666667
7960233,5,B0000640VQ,"Brazilian Director Walter Salles has made only four films, but he shows the ability to do character development, especially with younger actors, for which Federico Fellini was famous. He also has the ability to show one of the largest and most varied countries in the Americas that has a wild west, which Americans can identify with. If you like this film, I recommend Salles' Central Station, which is much like Behind The Sun in character development and breathtaking photography.
And don't forget Motorcycle Diaries, Salles' first film, which shows us most of South America through the eyes of Che Guevara.  I would like to see more of Brazil in his next film, hopefully in blu-ray. We know about the Amazon and Carnival in Rio (see Black Orpheus by Marcel Camus).

7960234,5,B0000640VQ,"Do you believe in vengeance? What is the cost? Behind the Sun is a beautifully shot very gnarly movie about life, death, and revenge. It's a dirty western style film that takes place in the Brazil countryside in 1910. This film is about old fashion family land feuds and the way they were handled without intervention of the law. One son is killed and another must die. Cycle continues. This film works on many different levels because the story is as relevant today as it has ever been. The outcome is refreshing, timeless, sad, but also extremely thoughtful. Behind the Sun actually challenges the viewer to rise above old and questionable thought patterns that are in need of reevaluation. This is a great movie and one that everyone should see at some point. Watch it and your mind will thank you.",1309132800,,801,4.6879432624113475
7960235,2,B0000640VQ,"""Behind the Sun"" is a kind of fable, I guess, about a small family of Brazilian sugar cane farmers. They are struggling to make it in competition with a larger family up the road. The rivalry between the families grows into a blood feud. One day, the circus comes to town in the shape of a beautiful girl and her stepfather. The small family's oldest son falls in love with the girl and runs off with her on a last gasp of fun before he meets his fate as the feud's next target.

The cinematography is great, with grand expressive shots of bloody shirts hanging on clotheslines and a memorable scene of a girl being twirled on a rope. There just isn't much story though, and what there is gets awfully confusing. ""Behind the Sun"" is a story about family rivalry, honor and love, but it made precious little sense to me. There may be layers and layers of symbolic action here, but I couldn't care enough to look for them. A real miss.",1267488000,2,933,4.362068965517241

Technically, you wouldn't even need a soundtrack to understand the story, and it is a good one, very moving.  A tale of a family feud with a definite surprise ending.

7960238,4,B0000640VQ,"Throughout the world there are a million stories happening every second.  Try to wrap your mind around that for a moment.  As I sit here and type, or as you sit there and read this review, there are people experiencing their lives through sadness, adventure, humor, or experimentation.  There are those who are finally breaking free from the monotony of life by exploring outside of the box to see where an unfocused, un-traveled path may lead them.  Alas, not all of these stories can make it to the screen, not all of the stories can be told, and not all of these stories deserve to - but thankfully acclaimed director Walter Salles picked up his camera, brought together a group of minimalist characters, and told one story that wasn't filled with CGI, wasn't headlined with big name box-office sensations, and wasn't filled with so many clichs that it would seem obvious Hollywood was financing the project.  Salles instead told a simple story about a family struggling with tradition, about a son ready to experience life, and about nobodies awakening themselves to a fresh bold day.  This is ""Abril Despedacado"" or ""Behind the Sun"", and for the normal film watcher this is probably a boring foreign film that dragged on for too long because of the intelligence of our nation, but for me, this film was closely near to cinematic perfection.

""Abril Despedacado"" is one of those films that you cannot judge directly after watching.  It is one of those films that needs to be developed within your mind first, chewed after, re-watched, then tackled.  It is not a simple film, yet Salles makes it so.  Confused?  I was too after watching this film, not because of the storyline, but because of my insecurity of emotion felt towards this title.  Typically, I can say - ""Nope"", or ""Yep, loved it"", but with this one it took me two viewings to fully find myself saying, ""This was nearly a masterpiece"".  This isn't your typical Hollywood film, but neither was his original first ""Central Station"", this is a film with minimal players, coupled with a simple plot, yet emotion raining down from the sky like fire.  It is about a family that is so caught up in tradition, that living just isn't available.  Year after year, or in this iteration, months after months, two families struggling for control over land (the bickering and death has gone on for so long that the land seems so unimportant in the grand scheme) kill one another in hopes that this final blow will be the last.  The crazy thing about tradition, it keeps going - and this one is not different - until now.  Two brothers, workhorses, who question this tradition after one is faced with the undutiful task of killing, look outside their small box of a life to see what else is out there to life for.  It is there they find something that has been missing - imagination, love, and most importantly - a life.

My description above seems, and feels to me like ultimate cheese spread on a film.  Why would I like this?  I think the first thing that pulled me towards this sleeper foreign film was the fact that I never quite new what was going to happen next.  The story was solid, when I say that I mean it was lacking the typical holes that clich Hollywood standards.  This story was so simple (yet not), that Salles was able to focus on our characters, enriching us with images of the land, the culture, and the possibilities.  The fact that this is a foreign film takes us away from the hardships, makes it almost fantastical, yet keeps us grandly rooted in reality.  I felt sympathy for all the characters because there was no defined evil, I wanted them to explore, go on adventures, and see opportunities that this tradition was holding them back from.  I loved the character of Pacu, or ""The Kid"", as he read the book given to him from a circus performer.  The fact that he couldn't read didn't stop him from using his imagination, bringing stories to life, and enjoying a small cusp of life that we typically take for granted.  What could have been dull or trite transformed by Salles vision into pure gold.  This was more than just a film, but instead a cry to anyone that may feel the pressures of work getting them down, and looking for any opportunity to escape.  ""Abril Despedacado"" is a universal story, rooted within an obscure culture.  Why did this take me two viewings to see it?

I must say everything fell perfectly into place with ""Abril Despedacado"", nothing was missing, nothing was forgotten, and nothing was misplaced.  In a year of overplayed, recycled films, this was a breath of fresh air.  Our characters were strong, yet independent.  I loved that Tonho wanted to leave, find a new hope, yet couldn't forget about his family, especially his younger brother.  I loved the sense of family and trust that happened within a small sect of people that really had nothing in common except the word ""family"" and the roof over their heads.  While the ending was sad, I saw it as the perfect wake up call for these two bickering families.  The scenery was genuine.  The music was somber.  Salles, in my eyes, couldn't have perfected ""Abril Despedacado"" any better.  I have seen some utter garbage this year, and while my eye for film is constantly changing with age, I think ""Abril Despedacado"" is one that families could enjoy, as well as anyone who found the courage to put this in their DVD player.  I am eager to see more of what Walter Salles has to offer, really explore his style, and suggest him thoroughly to friends and family.

Overall, I am very impressed with this film.  It is one that could be watched again and again, and more could be discovered.  It is the perfect film to enjoy on a rainy day, with a warm cup of coffee, and enjoy the beauty that Salles creates with such a poignant family drama that obviously has a date on it, but can be considered universal.  Time has shown on this film, AND proven that ""Abril Despedacado"" is one that can sustain the test of time.  Bravo Walter Salles, Bravo!
