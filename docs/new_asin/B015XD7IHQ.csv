7453383,5,B015XD7IHQ,"A perfect collection of Noir mysteries and beautifully shot frames! Spanning 3 discs, it covers 11 classic titles with heavy hitters such as  Fritz Lang, Orson Welles and Anne Sheridan. Titles included are : Scarlet Street, Woman on the Run, Quicksand, Detour, Inner Sanctum, Kansas City Confidential, The Stranger, Fear in the Night, The Strange Woman, The Red House, and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. In addition to the film themes presented, the quality of the picture is also great. I would recommend this to the devout Noir addict as well as someone just starting to explore the genre, as it serves as a perfect introduction.",1451433600,20,634,4.925233644859813
7453384,5,B015XD7IHQ,"gem of a DVD set. It contains 11 film noir films on a 3 DVD set and a synopsis of all the films. Some of these movies such as quicksand, Detour, Hallow Triumph and others have been offered as separate DVD or Blu Ray titles by them but now you can snag 11 great films packed into one box. It's a total win situation. The 3 discs come in a multi disc box that is no thicker than a standard single disc box so that is a bonus for those of us with limited storage space.

The list of movies are as follows:
Scarlet Street (1945,120mins), Woman on the Run (1950, 77 mins), Quicksand (1950, 79 mins),
Detour (1945, 67 mins), Fear In the Night (1947, 72 mins), Inner Sanctum (1948, 62 mins),
The Strange Woman (1946, 99 mins), Kansas City Confidential (1952, 99 mins),
The Red House (1947, 100 mins), The Stranger (1946, 95 mins),
and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946, 116 mins)

A well rounded set of films all neatly packaged into one set at a very reasonable price. You can't go wrong by adding this one to your collection even if you already own some of these movies as standalone discs. Some of the bigger names in this set are Mickey Rooney, Ann Sheridan, Orson Welles and many others. Although I haven't watched every film on the discs yet the ones I have watched are quality. Intriguing stories and well shot movies are what you can expect to see. Even though these were shot in the 40s and 50s the transfers are excellent. For example when the titles are up you can read the small type except for some of the tiniest fonts but that's true of most movies these days.

I recommend this to film buffs who love film noir and the romance of bad guys vs good guys in the films of days gone by.

7453385,4,B015XD7IHQ,Very enjoyable movies. It's a good selection of File Noire flicks. Glad I made the purchase,1497312000,2,91,4.75
7453386,2,B015XD7IHQ,"The collection of reviews here are misleading. The quality of transfers in this set, are, on average, precisely what you'd expect for the price- sometimes washed out, almost always lacking in detail, globby, almost VHS-like. On the plus side, there isn't a lot of noise and the sound appears pretty good. There are three films with quite good transfers: Scarlet Street, Kansas City Confidential and The Strange Woman. The visuals are crisp, dynamic range good, and the print shows little wear. The Strange Love of Martha Ivers is also sharp, but the blacks are muddy, highlights pushed close to blowing out, and many scenes look heavily vignetted (perhaps that's true to the source, but it looks odd). Nevertheless, it's better than the rest of the films, which are low-resolution, if watchable. I was especially disappointed with Detour, which has been released many times in poor form. The version here may have good sound and little noise, but the visuals are poor. For the price this set still may be worth it, but the nearly five-star rating here is absurd. This is more like a three-star set that gets a few things right and a lot of middling bonus material. If you are looking for a good primary reference for these movies, I'd bet you could do better elsewhere.",1494547200,27,1269,4.825688073394495

7453388,5,B015XD7IHQ,I've yet to even open this collection but am already stoked . Big time . I'd already seen about six of the eleven films here . I own Quicksand and Kansas City Confidential on DVD . I'd have owned more of these features by now but it was cost prohibitive for me prior to this Dark Film Mysteries  collection release . I gather these are wonderful prints and consider myself very fortunate to have been availed of this super reasonably priced triple disc set . Great thanks to Amazon for the recommendation and my fellow writers here for cluing me in to its merits . If you're a noir fan don't hesitate . Automatic .,1494288000,6,614,4.339130434782609

7453393,5,B015XD7IHQ,I love watching film noir and always look for it on Amazon video or TCM. So when I saw this collection I bought it. So far I've seen the first three films and I'm loving this set! Highly recommended,1461456000,7,198,4.102564102564102

8734922,4,B015XD7IHQ,Great selection though Scarlett Street was the real deal breaker for me. It costs about 12 for a dvd on its own so here with about 11 other noir classics was a score. Only complaint is that the Detour print is a bit fuzzy and has a vignette.,1518048000,3,241,4.041666666666667

8734927,5,B015XD7IHQ,"Only new to film noir, but since i had already seen one of the films on this 3-disc set - 'Quicksand'(1950/Mickey Rooney), i knew instantly this was going to be a riveting collection of unkown film noirs and HAD to get it. These are the kind of obscure film noirs that grip you tight from start to finish, they're based on real life, the stuff that really is chilling. Haven't finished it yet so expect a more comprehensive update soon, but so far all of these look excellent, and GREAT VALUE!",1507248000,,493,4.428571428571429
