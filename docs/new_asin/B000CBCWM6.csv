8096579,4,B000CBCWM6,"Tatsumiyajima is an island off the coast of Japan. It is a self sustained island that is a source of hope in a world overrun with alien invaders called The Festum. The teenagers that live on this island pilot mechas called Fafner. Fafner is the only means for destroying The Festum. Kazuki is the greatest warrior among the Fafner pilots. He has a strong sense of justice and loyalty to his loved ones. He risks everything, along with his friends, to protect humanity.

There are a lot of mecha series out there. This one is above average. It doesn't reach the level of Evangelion, but it's a heck of a lot better than Gasraki. I think that it is most like RahXephon. If you've seen RahXephon, then you can get a pretty good idea of what this is like. It has good animation, voice acting, and a suitable soundtrack. There is plenty of action and drama is Fafner as well.

After hearing all of that you're probably wondering, ""why not 5 stars then""? The reason I can't give it 5 stars is b/c some of the characters seemed very distant. Even though the characters feelings and love for each other was a major theme, the relationships between them weren't developed very well. I think that the psychology of the Fafner pilots was focused on too much. The thing that would have made this series great was stronger relationships between them. This is the reason It wasn't great. Don't get me wrong, Fafner is definitely good, but it lacked the most important thing it needed...character development.",1358467200,,1494,4.633962264150943
8096580,5,B000CBCWM6,"OK people, what is Fafner?

Before I get into the story, I will try to answer a hypothetical question first: Who should not and who should watch Fafner.

To begin with, if you are a die-hard fan of Evangelion or Gundam etc. than most probably you will not want to watch this one because it has some similarities with the previous mention animes indeed; and you most probably will `blow away' a great anime like this. On the other hand, people who would like to watch a very good anime, with strong storyline, twists, romance, lots of action and of course Mechas (belongs to the so called sci-fi category) than you should watch this one.

Let us proceed to the storyline:

It starts with the life of people, teenagers going to school, adults to work etc. by introducing the viewer to their everyday life. The place where the story starts is called Tatsumiya Island. To make the long story short, aliens attack earth and obviously the Island gets under attack, devastating their lives and throwing the teenagers into battle; basically, because they are the ones who are able to fly the Mechas. Additionally, power games will start to evolve, exhausting battles all over the globe will occur, between sort of government and military parties etc. and all the teenagers are caught in the middle of all this. As the series proceed, many questions will be raised (which will be answered - directly or indirectly - in the end of the series), the bounds between the main protagonists will become stronger (and of course romance), the viewer will witness all the emotional rollercoaster that these youngsters will go through and some of them will even die.

This sums up the story. I could get into more details and tell you what will go on in every episode but I refrained myself from doing this because I believe that if someone decides to watch the series than I would give away the entire suspense and twists of it.

Overall critique about the series:

If you are into Mechas for a while, then most probably you have watched Mecha series and are familiar with the common pattern that this kind of animes are following: teenagers are the ones who can fly the Mechas, alien invasion, battles, romance, power games etc (as for the good guy vs. bad guy, in the Mecha series this usually presents a grey zone). Therefore, why should someone watch Fafner? If you are not into animes for a long time, should you watch Fafner?

The answer would be yes. First of all, because of its animation, which is very good. Second, because of its storyline, which although is based on the common pattern that is been explained above, yet, it manages to bring forth new ideas, a solid and strong storyline, many twists and mainly till the final episodes you will not be able to foresee its final conclusion. Even if you are a die-hard fan of Evangelion, RahXephon etc. this one is definitely worth a watch from you. As for the action, the series are packed with it. Third, because of its dub; in other words, if you belong to the category of people that instead of Japanese would prefer the English dub, it is very good done and professional orchestrated. Thumbs up!

Apart from it, if you buy the box set or the complete collection, then the box is exactly the one you see in the picture, which is very strong, like a shelf and doesn't brake easily. As for extras, the usual stuff like previews of other animes, not credit opening/ending and so forth.

To the most obvious question: Buying it or not? To be honest, if you can afford the money than I will definitely recommend these series to you, if, you can not afford the money than try to rent it and watch it.

To conclude these series are highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you...",1169769600,,3721,4.587349397590361
8096581,4,B000CBCWM6,"The Neo UN's plans to occupy Tatsumiya Island do not go as hoped. Unable to unlock the secrets of Alvis' Nothung model Fafners, and bewildered by the disappearance of the island's core, the occupiers soon find their ambitions tested to the breaking point. A new Festum invasion places the occupation force on the defensive against a foe it has little hope of defeating. Only through the actions of the island's remaining Fafner pilots, and the timely return of Kazuki in his new Mark Sein, is the attack foiled. Commander Makabe assumes control over the island once more and the Neo UN, bitter with defeat, retreats, but not without one last parting shot. With Kazuki returned and two Human Force pilots choosing to remain with Alvis, Tatsumiya Island's defenses are stronger than ever. Together with friends Kenji, Mamoru, and Sakura, and guided by Soshi, Kazuki and his allies become an impressive fighting force able to withstand the enemy at every turn. Tsubaki Minashiro, the island's `core', continues to aid the young defenders as well. Her new found freedom from the bowels of the island offers the young girl a chance to learn more about those she protects, as well as offer insight into the nature of the enemy. It is not long before a sense of security returns to the island and the children are able to ease back into their civilian lives.

The tranquility does not last long, however. Alvis receives a surprise visit from Maya Tomi's father, now a chief player in the Neo UN's hierarchy. Seeking to remove his family from the island, and acquire Maya for his own purposes, the good doctor is soon opposed by Alvis at every turn. The conflict reveals what Maya has feared all along, that her family has shielded her from piloting Fafner. Armed with this knowledge, Maya hopes to confront her father and superiors in order to take her place along side Kazuki in the battles to come.

With the events of the previous volume resolved, Fafner now moves into the final story arc that will propel it to the conclusion. While there is revelation abound in these episodes, few are truly concrete enough to offer viewers clear explanations. However frequent viewers of this series have undoubtedly grown to expect this somewhat unorthodox nature of plot development. Nevertheless this volume proves to be as entertaining as the previous installments, providing enough action and human drama to keep any mecha fan happy. Because there are so many characters, it is difficult to find time for each and every one of them to grow. That does not stop a few of them from growing closer, occasionally exchanging tense and flirtatious stares with each other. The character of Tsubaki, the island's core, is also a welcome addition to the cast. Always cheerful and very insightful, Tsubaki's presence offers potential answers as well as more mystery (just why is the core in the shape of a little girl who may or may not be the younger sister of Soshi?).

With two volumes remaining, we can only hang on tight and see where the road leads.",1164844800,,3033,4.828846153846154
