Apparently, lifelong TV director Jeff Woolnough shared my sentiment about this taking too long, and released his own sequel a mere eight years after the first movie. In a way, this is a more direct continuation of the story than ""The Return"" because it focuses on events taking place immediately after the first film and features both major and minor returning characters. However, all but one of these is played by different performers, and because this isn't Jean-Claude Van Damme returning as Luc Devereaux (it's actually Aron Tager as his father), the movie is almost unanimously dropped by fans of the original and considered ""unofficial."" I wouldn't go that far, but that doesn't change that this here's a pretty disappointing film.

The story: Luc (former NFL star Matt Battaglia) is captured and reprogrammed by his militaristic reanimators, moving journalist Veronica (Chandra West,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Noise/dp/B00005JNNT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Noise</a>) to pursue him in an adventure that will reveal Luc's long-lost brother Eric (Jeff Wincott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martial-Law-II-Undercover/dp/6302468035/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martial Law II: Undercover</a>).

Let's get right to the biggie: Matt Battaglia is no Van Damme. He's got the build and isn't hopeless when it comes to physicality (I liked his fight against Steven Seagal in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Half-Past-Dead/dp/B0000844MD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Half Past Dead</a>), but he can't hold a candle to JCVD's likeability and just can't do a thing with this role. Even before he's reconverted into a pseudo-zombie, he pulls a monotone act like few I've seen before. Additionally, another instance wherein ""Brothers in Arms"" is outshone by its prequel is comedy. The script has an okay amount of humor in it, but it feels shoehorned and few of the jokes or setups are laugh-out-loud material, including the recreated scene wherein Veronica removes a receiver out of the half-naked Luc's leg. And again, Battaglia's delivery doesn't help: while Van Damme's rendition of Luc punctuated his introversion with the occasional display of cute naivet, Battaglia's is flat, flat, flat. I doubt he was given much leeway by the script, but Matt just doesn't seem right for this part in any aspect.

The movie opens with the unaccountably awkward restaging of the duel between Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, with the latter's part being briefly played by Andrew Jackson, who appeared in Lundgren's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blackjack/dp/B004P7CMTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blackjack</a>&nbsp;but otherwise hardly resembles the Swedish Superman. Nevertheless, this scene is one of only two fights in the movie, the second of which doesn't occur until almost the very end, when Luc takes on stuntman/Unisol Kevin Rushton in a very stiff brawl. There's also some shooting to be seen, but that's about it. Jeff Wincott's character doesn't even get to fight, which is the biggest personal disappointment the film offers. What the movie doesn't have a shortage of, however, are pop songs from its soundtrack: there's so many of these - from a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Major/dp/B000065QAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Major</a>&nbsp;country tune to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bif-Naked/dp/B00000JG38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bif Naked</a>&nbsp;electropop number - and almost none of them are suitable to the scenes they play against, but in lieu of so many other things wrong with the movie, it's nice to have something to listen to.

I've heard a rumor that this one was actually filmed as the pilot to a TV series which was never produced. I'd buy that rumor, and for a television show, this one started off with a good cast, including Gary Busey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon/dp/0790729695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon</a>) and Burt Reynolds (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Nights/dp/B000PAAJZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Nights</a>) as villains. That just wasn't enough for this opener, however, and while I intend to watch the second ""unofficial"" sequel, that one will have a lot of building to do to get a higher rating than this.",1362441600,2,5003,6.886435331230284
7888728,2,6305403384,"As part of an agreement between the brothers Sid, the original blu-ray edition of Universal Soldier goes to headquarters South while the VHS sequel goes to headquarters North. Now this was just fine because no matter how you slice it B is B. In fact we in the North were pretty pumped up by the thought of doing the sequel, especially knowing that the giant toothed legend Garey Busey was on the bill. In an unfortunate development turns out the sequel blows big time. Even with screen legend and Sid beloved Gary Busey on the scene the films horrible plot couldn't be brought to a place of enjoyment.

This one apparently picks up where the first one left off, just minus the budget, actors, and plot. The universal soldiers are now being created by Gary Busey to use them to help smuggle diamonds to foreign buyers. Honestly Sid was roughly 16 at the time this came out and is pretty confident we could have come up with a better plot. Really? This is what Gary Busey is choosing to use these cyborg soldiers for? Anyway Luc Deveroux from the first movie survived the original incident and teams up with some news reporter to stop the breeding of these soldiers for the wrong reason. Yeah it's pretty much even worse then it sounds.

Now one might ask why the two star rating if the movie was that bad? Well it's simple; 1 star is automatic just because Gary Busey was cast in the film and the second come from Busey getting smashed across the face with a pool stick, sending him crashing through a glass window to ultimately die from the fall. The fact that that replayed the pool stick smack in three different camera angles back to back didn't hurt either. It's really ashame being that they made a bunch of these Universal Soldier movies, but it won't deter us. Sid South will be taking care of the original and it's very likely we'll be doing the others in the franchise.",1298246400,,1878,4.504398826979473
7888729,3,6305403384,"This made for TV made movie is a decent update of the man that VanDamma played in the original. It still deals with the man Luc Devereaux has from being a former Unisol. The Unisol program is tracking the former  solider. Luc also has a lady friend who works for the media helping him. The  action is decent (considering it's for TV ) Also in this movie is Gary  Busey playing a commander of Universal Soliders. There are couple of plot  of plot twists along the way so I won't give them away! This movie has non  stop action,thrills and searing special effects! Its a fun movie even if  you have not seen the original movies !",954115200,3,627,4.316239316239316
