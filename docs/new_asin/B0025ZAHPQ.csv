8351496,5,B0025ZAHPQ,"What a wonderful surprise to discover that there was such a DVD.  I have always enjoyed the works of the masters of diverse acting: Brando, McQueen, Dean and of course, Depp.  I have already purchased several of the Biography series programs several years ago, but this is an updated and uncut version of those programs and more... The run time for each is about double the regular played shows. I loved the uncut comments and updated footage.  Definitely a must for anyone who admirers these fine actors.",1260835200,3,505,4.781609195402299
