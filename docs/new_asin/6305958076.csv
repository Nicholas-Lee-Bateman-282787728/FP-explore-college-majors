1098604,4,6305958076,"Although the film flip-flops and completely loses it's delicate balance right before it concludes, there is enough that is absolutely right to recommend this autobiographical look at a working class Muslim family in Manchester, England.  The humor is warm and genuine, and the inevitable brutality we uncomfortably witness is believable.  The acting is first rate with a couple of marvelous stand out performances.
East is East is set near Manchester in 1971.  We meet George Khan (wonderfully played by Om Puri- who played a similar role in the better; My Son the Fanatic) who has one daughter and six sons, runs a fish and chips shop, and tries to control the lives of everyone in his family according to  strict Muslim codes of behavior.  Since he's also trying to be a good Muslim, good businessman, good father and keep up with current events involving the India-Pakistan war, he is not in touch with the details of his children's lives.  In fact he doesn't even realize that his youngest son was never circumcised as is a Muslim tradition. He is also trying to be a good husband for the English woman he loves.  Yes, his children are mixed, they are English and Pakistan.
George's children see him as a hypocritical tyrant who screams orders to his family about the proper way to dress, the need to attend Muslim religious school, the necessity of arranged marriages which he himself has turned his back on, since he has left the first Mrs. Khan back in Pakistan.  It's is the Muslim way of things and arranged marriages is how it must be done and George's offspring should not ask questions of how he married their English mom, but get in line and do as they are told.
How the family relates to each other is captured well in the opening scene which shows his children naughtily joining a parade of Catholics, while their Mom, Ella (in a powerfully effective performance from Linda Basset), distracts their father George just enough so they can get away with their playful ruse.
In an early scene, George's eldest son runs from the alter just prior to wedding a young Pakistan girl in an arranged meeting.  He flees the alter and the family.  Later it's matter-of-factly revealed he's gay and part of a very successful high fashion shop (hats I believe).  To George this son has not just rejected the arranged marriage and become independent, but he has died.
The tone that is set is one where humor comes out of very real autobiographical vignettes that seem authentic and realistic.  In fact the film is based on a stage play which has been adapted for the screen by the play write; Ayub Khan-Din.  It's directed by a very confident and assured freshman director, Damien O'Donnel.
There are many themes that are woven throughout the film, the clash of traditions versus juvenille rebellion, the importance of family, the racism this family of Pakistani's face from even their neighbors, the sibling rivalries, the pursuit of one's dreams, the dangers of false pride, and the importance of love.
All of these things are well balanced through almost the entire film.  The performances are all very strong.  There is an extended sequence involving the youngest boys' need for a circumcision, which is played mostly for humor, but reveals again how dominating George Kahn and his insistence of being a good Muslim family truly is.  There are subplots involving a neighborhood romance which strike just the right type of awkward tone.  There are several comedic moments that arise from the family's living conditions.  Three of the six sons share the same bed.  There is no indoor toilet facilities so pee pots and cast iron tubs are still in use.
The film sharply turns to show us a brutal and disturbing scene. It's a scene that feels truthful and makes the film a lot more powerful than the almost light comedy it has been.
Unfortunately after the film becomes disturbing it then tries tries to quickly shift back to it's earlier lighter tone.  This attempted shift feels all wrong and left me with many mixed feelings.  If we are indeed being authentic, then the film-makers insisting on trying give the film a feel-good type of ending is utterly hypocritical and false.  Perhaps the  material was mercilessly cut, and several scenes exist on the cutting room floor ( or in the original theatrical play)  that would have made the film play much better.  Or perhaps the film-makers failed to realize just how much impact the bit of brutality we see really has.  It's a pity because when the film tries to switch back it derails and loses it's slice of life honesty to become just another film that only partially lets us peak into the lives of people who are different, yet very much like we are.
I am glad however, that ultimately despite the flaws, and disappointing ending (where loose ends are left dangling everywhere) there is a deep lingering sense of the love and commitment that exists in a very strong, very unique marriage -George and Ella's.
East is East won the Alexander Korda award for Outstanding British Film at this year's British Academy Awards.  It's almost ironic since George Kahn is based on writer Ayub Khan Din's father who worked as an extra not just on Dam Busters (which is mentioned in East is East) but also on one of Korda's films as well.  Kahn had some problem with racism on the set until Korda sat with Kahn during his lunch breaks.",978566400,7,5374,4.755651237890205
1098605,5,6305958076,"if the idea behind ""art"" is to elicit a strong emotion than this movie is definitely artwork. Although there are really funny parts, i'm not sure if everyone will find it funny nor do i think that 'east is east' is supposed to be pure comedy. for me it was like watching episodes from my own family life becuase my dad is Pakistani and my mom is froma blue-collar Irish-American family.
Basically, if you want pure laughs unadultrated by a commitment to reality and the human condition, watch something else... God knows we all need that sometimes. but if you want to see a serious film which happens to be very humorous as well, get this one. Om Puri is a badassed actor by any standard.",977184000,3,688,4.468253968253968
1098606,3,6305958076,"""East is East"" is a great film on the tensions that interracial families often face.  Often, the children will prefer one parent's culture over the other's, and the latter is hurt.  This is a funny, yet bittersweet picture that everyone should see.  (Note:  You need a little background in Islamic culture before you see this.  For example, the bride and groom in the arranged marriage are not allowed to see each other until the day of matrimony.)
Now, on to the DVD.  The video and audio quality are very good.  However, the supplemental area leaves a lot to be desired.  The region 2 disc has many extras, including a director's commentary, deleted scenes, interviews, and TV spots.  Buena Vista only put a theatrical trailer on the region 1 disc.  Since this was such a good film and was a huge hit in its native Britain, they should have included at least some interviews.
My advice:  See this film!  It is excellent.  If you have a player capable of playing all regions, get the region 2 version of ""East is East"" for its supplements.",970963200,5,1040,4.617486338797814

1098608,5,6305958076,"It's a sad state of affairs when Hugh Grant is about the only thing North Americans associate with British cinema. For the most part English films never seem to surface over here which is a real shame because there are some great ones being made. Sure, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was pretty big but for every ""Lock, Stock"" we also get three counterfeit British films like Notting Hill or Mickey Blue Eyes. There are a number of really excellent movies being made in the UK that unfortunately will never see the time of day; Final Cut with Jude Law, Heart, The Debt Collector etc...
""East is East"" somehow made it across the pond and believe me when I say that it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. The story centers around the Khan family, and their growing up in 1970's Manchester. George, the Father is a traditional Pakistani who secretly arranges for two of his sons to be married. This causes a rift in the family that results in many hilarious antics and some surprisingly good dramatic scenes.
The film's big focus is of course weather or not the son's have the right to choose their own destiny. Having being born and raised in England they are for the most part oppposed to their Father's views.
""East is East"" is a very effective comedy. The relationship between everyone in the family is perfect and makes for many laughs. Each of the character's are quick witted and clever which is a refreshing change from seeing something from the Adam Sandler school of comedy. Ultimately it is the relationship between all the characters that really makes this movie work well. There is a deep sense of family that is constantly tested by everyone baiting and antagonizing each other.
""East is East"" is a great little British film that is so much more effective than the overated, crowd pleasing ""Full Monty."" If only North America got a great movie from England like this each week we'd be set. (The inclusion of Supergrass was also great.)",969926400,7,1967,4.655172413793103
1098609,2,6305958076,"I have been reading what other people have thought of EAST IS EAST, and just want to know:  WHAT WAS SO FUNNY? I watch alot of british comedies, and this was not that funny at all.  I was very disappointed with this film.  It was more dramatic and tragic than comedic.  It's about a family in which the Pakistan father of a large group of children, whose mother is English.  The father is trying to keep with tradition of Pakistan and arrange his sons' marriages.  There was very little humor in my opinion, I laughed maybe four times in the entirity of the film.  The acting was pretty good, but it was so sad how the father treated his family especially his wife.  It was disturbing to me how it ended. I don't recommend this movie at all, it was fair.",969667200,2,754,4.297872340425532
1098610,5,6305958076,I'm sorry but this is probably one of the funniest films i've ever seen.  Pure british humour at its best. If you liked The Full Monty you HAVE to  see this movie !!!!!!! 5 stars just isn't enough - I give it 10,968976000,,211,3.883720930232558
1098611,4,6305958076,"`East is East,' something of a modern day version of `Fiddler on the  Roof,' explores the culture clash that occurs in the context of a half  Pakistani/half British family living in early 1970's England. George Khan  is a Muslim who, upon immigrating to Great Britain in 1937, married a  British woman despite the fact that his first wife still lives in Pakistan.  Now, twenty five years later, the still happily married couple lives in a  small apartment with their daughter and six sons all of whom have been  raised to honor their father's religion and traditions. Yet, like Tevye,  George is suddenly confronted with the fact that, as times change and the  world moves on, the younger generation will no longer abide by the archaic  rituals of an ancient age. In many ways, this is the flip side of `Fiddler'  in that here the reluctant marriage partners are sons and not daughters.  For indeed, George's ultimate goal in life is to arrange marriages for his  teenaged sons within the accepted tradition of the Muslim faith. But  culture is often a force that parents try in vain to withstand and these  children, raised in the far more open and liberated society of `mod'  England, are not about to take such dictatorial parental control lying  down.
In the script based on his play, Ayub Khan-Din provides an  evenhanded and comprehensive view of the situation. George is not presented  to us as an inflexible or unreasonable ogre, yet at the same time, he will,  in his frustration, strike out even physically at the children and the wife  who seem to oppose him. We sense the fear that runs through him that, if  his sons are allowed to exercise their freedom in this one crucial area,  the family will sever that connection with the past which brings stability  to their lives. Thus, without any traditions to anchor them, George dreads  that he and the family will be cut adrift in a seemingly rudderless world  that suddenly seems in the 1970's to be in such great and terrifying moral  flux. Moreover, we are left to ponder the strange contradiction between  George's own words and the choices he himself has made. After all, his  opting to marry a British woman who does not share the tenets of his faith  obviously went beyond the bounds of the very traditions he is now so  dogmatically insisting his sons uphold. This type of ambiguity within the  characters enhances their credibility, for indeed life and the people we  meet therein come replete with such maddening inconsistencies.
Khan-Din  and director Damien O'Donnell establish an effective balance between  low-key humor and occasionally searing drama. The relationship between the  husband and wife who comprise this interracial marriage is complexly  realized and fully drawn; the obvious difficulties the two have experienced  as a result of the nonconformity of their union has obviously strengthened  their devotion to one another and they appear to greatly enjoy each other's  company. She has undoubtedly made any number of concessions and compromises  to her husband's belief system, yet she has retained her British feistiness  and knows how far to let George go before she draws the line, especially  when it comes to protecting the rights and happiness of her own progeny. In  a similar way, we see, in thorough detail, the complexities that make up  the two very different sets of relationships between the respective parents  and their children. Din and O'Donnell have, wisely, chosen to limit the  scope of their film by downplaying the broader theme of how a suspicious  and prejudiced society deals with so unconventional a marriage and family.  We see only bits and pieces of this in the form of bigoted comments uttered  by a disapproving neighbor and a mere mention of a political rally intended  to rouse the populace on the issue of `repatriation.' Instead, the authors  concentrate almost exclusively on the internecine struggles taking place  within this one family. This helps to keep the scale of the film  life-sized, thus enhancing our identification with the characters and their  universal parent/child conflicts. For, in a way, the Khan family is really  not undergoing any crisis not already familiar to countless families the  world over, as parents cope with children eager to cut the filial chords  and establish life on their own terms and as children, likewise, deal with  parents who want to determine the course those lives will take. The Khans  just happen to provide a more heightened and intensified view of this  subject.
`East is East' is a small movie but an absorbing one. Thanks to  uniformly excellent performances from a gifted cast and a careful  modulation between humor and drama, the film emerges as a compelling and  insightful glimpse into a life that is, as for all of us, so full of both  terrifying and wonderful complexity.",968544000,3,4855,4.951552795031056
1098612,5,6305958076,"I admit, I cried during this movie.  It was difficult to watch the entire Khan family, all seven kids plus mom Ella and dad George, struggle with an identity that not only identified them as individuals, but as a family.  It  hits a chord not only with immigrant families, but all families.  It  relates the struggles of finding a balance between parental power and  individual control.  But despite all that mushy stuff, it's absolutely  hilarious.  Not only are the accents adorably amusing, the children remind  you of what it was like to be young again and caught by your parents doing  something you shouldn't have been.  The opening scene lends to this as it  follows the kids running through alleys so their father, a strict Muslim,  doesn't see them marching in a Catholic parade.  You can't help but laugh  at their antics.  The film is able to embrace both tradition and progress  without becoming too boring.  Definitely an A+!",964137600,13,938,4.786163522012578

1098838,5,6305958076,"Om Puri as usual is great.  The story is about his family with an English woman in the Pakistan centered universe of Whitechapel, London, England (on a sidenote, this was fun for me, because this is the neighborhood where my Jewish grandfather was born in 1900).  The children all being raised as ""good Muslims"" more or less by Puri who is somewhat devout byhe who is devout an Englishwoman who seems to be able to fit in as an extra offbeat, well-intentioned and ethical sister on Hyacinth's show.  This indicates the difficulties of trying to raise a devout Muslim family in changing times, particularly in a Westerm country, with a British mother (who is occasionally threatened by their father that he will leave her for his first wife in Pakistan that he has no intention of doing).  It also shows what is expected for the boys in terms of arranged marriages.

1098961,5,6305958076,"This is one terrific movie. While it centers around a Pakistani father's conflict with Western culture which his children not only embrace but are a part of, it is a universal theme about the cultural conflicts that occur when people from any culture are transplanted to a new and very different way of life. As is always the case the children of immigrants adapt to and want to ""belong"" to the new culture of their friends and neighbors. The parents or parent in this case wants to instill and continue his beliefs and traditions in his children. This is a movie that explores these very real and at times violent conflicts. It does so with touching sentiment as well as wonderful touches of humor. Throughout the film we are both simpathetic as well as angered by the father's behavior toward his children because we see it from our own western perspective.  Yet we come to see that he is driven by real concern and love for his children as well as for his cultural beliefs. We come to see that while it is important to be a part of an adopted culture it is none the less important to preserve those positive elements of our own cultural traditions.

1098963,5,6305958076,"East is East is about a family with split religious beliefs.

In order to try to keep some semblance of peace, the children do everything they can to balance the conflict while the mother tries to be a sort of referee in the situation.  The only drawback to the movie is that you might have to watch it several times to understand the dialog because of the father's heavy English and Eastern accent.  The great thing is that the more times you watch this movie the more you get out of it.

1098964,5,6305958076,"I watched this almost a decade ago, and watched it again tonight on cable. It is still as fresh and funny as I remembered it! ""East is East"" stars the talented Om Puri [""City of Joy"", ""My Fanatic Son""] as a Pakistani immigrant to Britain who has married an Englishwoman and fathered six sons and a daughter. Despite marrying a local, George Khan [Om Puri] is adamant that his children follow the old ways and the traditions of his culture, such as circumcision for his sons, and also arranged marriages. Though the movie adopts a light-hearted look at the clash between East and West, it also has an underlying seriousness to it. Khan's grown children [except for the youngest son who is under 12] chafe at the strictures imposed upon their freedom, preferring to embrace their mother's Western ideals rather than the tradition-bound strictures of their father's culture. Only one son embraces the strict, religious lifestyle of the father.

""East is East"" has amazing scenes scattered throughout the movie - little gems that will have one laughing out loud or cringing in disgust. One particular highlight is the one where Khan's only daughter sings and dances, with a broom, to the tune of an old Hindi song as she scrubs and cleans! The acting by the ensemble cast is credible and excellent, drawing us into the lives of one unique family set against the backdrop of 1970s Manchester, England.

A+++++,1234396800,,326,5.055555555555555
1098966,3,6305958076,"Let me start by saying that this film is terribly mislabeled as a comedy when it is, in fact, very much a drama. Yes, there are times when I laughed out loud but I chose this film because I was in the mood for a comedy. Had I been in the mood for a drama I am sure I would have scored the film much higher.

""East is East"" is the story of a Pakistani father, George Khan, his Caucasian British wife, Ella, and their seven children. The acting is superb, the writing is excellent, and the soundtrack is wonderful. Having said all of that, I do have a few issues with the film. (SPOILER ALERT) First, the oldest son, Nazir, just kind of disappears for a while without any explanation. Did he run away? Did he kill himself? Where did he go? We find out about halfway through the film when his father pronounces that he is dead. This leaves the viewer wondering how one could have missed such an important event, but a few minutes later we realize that Nazir is only dead to him. In fact, we discover, albeit something I guessed in the first ten minutes of the film, that Nazir is gay. This is all the more reason for his Pakistani father to call him dead.

My second issue with the film is that I really liked all of the characters, even the strict and traditional George. Ella is charming the way she can talk him down from almost any argument with typical British humor mixed with a few choice swear words. The kids adore their mother and, although they disagree with him, they love their father. This led me to believe that the film was going to be a ""Dad is a strict traditional man, kids and mom are not, so this is the story of how everyone changes Dad."" (SPOILER ALERT) Unfortunately, the story became, ""Dad is an abusive and closed-minded bastard and starts beating on anyone, including mom, who dares to defy him."" I just don't understand why the story had to change this way. I left the film wishing Ella would leave her bastard husband and raise her kids on her own. We went from the tenderness of how Ella would ask George if he would like some tea and he would reply, ""just half a cup"", to George calling her a ""bloody b****"" and giving her a black eye. Why? My final issue with the film is the ending. (SPOILER ALERT) We are left with nothing changed in the family other than the children discovering that their father isn't just strict, he is cruel. I just feel incomplete after watching ""East is East"". I get that the Pakistani culture is very different from British culture and that, particularly in the 1970's, the west was not very open to accepting this new group of immigrants. What else came of this story? I don't feel warm and fuzzy toward this culture if George is a shining of example of how the men truly behave. Why did he choose to marry outside of his own culture if he hates it so much? Why raise children with a mother who is not Muslim and not from Pakistan if you are just going to teach them that it is unacceptable to marry anyone who is not from Pakistan? I feel like I got a glimpse of a very dysfunctional family who will never see a happy ending and that is just not why I choose to watch films. I watch films to learn something new, or to laugh, to perhaps cry a little, but overall, I watch films to have a few hours of enjoyment. I watch films to forget my own problems for a while. After watching this, I just feel like I would have been better off calling my own family back home and hearing about their issues and problems.",1232841600,,3466,4.273972602739726

At least that's the billing it got when it was recommended to me by friends, and also how I heard it touted years ago by Terry Gross on NPR's Fresh Air. The main character here, George Khan, played by India's prolific Om Puri, is among the least sympathetic figures in all of recent cinema, which would be fine if the feeling was he was being set up to be presented that way, but the impression I got was that we were meant to receive him as more of a misguided soul than an abusive tyrant. He beats his wife, alienates his children by among other things seeking to force arranged marriages onto them, is a bigamist (of sorts) and a total bigot who thinks all Indians are evil and out to get him and other Pakistanis, yet the situations and clues in the background music seem determined to dismiss his antics as humorous. So spousal abuse and overseer-like control of children is funny, then, is it? As I watched this film, all I could think of was good riddance to Mr. Khan's traditions and customs, and long live the tolerance we have here in the west. I found the lives of his children, especially his hairdresser son and English-born wife, to be much more interesting than the self-torturing Khan. East Is East has merit but that comes as a study of cultures in a time and place not long past rather than from its central character, George Khan.

The cast was very well chosen-every actor did such a good job-from the little shy boy Sajid to the dominant father George!

On the one hand, there is shown the gap between modernity and past, between Pakistani and English culture, but on the other bloody hand there is no bloody soltution for this bastard-conflict, but even somehow a justification for the bloody father's attitude.

His eldest son doesn't follow the father's order of getting married and -TADA- he gets gay, what is presented in a very negative way. This is at the same time the second conflict - thout any solution this time.

Such an effort is always invariabily a futile attempt and a swim against the tide.  Very often the first generation immigrants tend to overdo it.

When I first saw this movie in 2000 I was disturbed by its uneven tone -- lighthearted one second then in a flash heavy-handed (literally) and vicious.

1099123,1,6305958076,"I saw this terrible excuse for a movie on TV a few years ago. I would never, EVER in a MILLION, BILLION years buy this garbage unless I was PAID to do so!

The creators of this ""film"" should be ASHAMED for producing this stereotypical load of excrement. If Amazon.com allowed NO stars, that is what I would have chosen for this trash. As a matter of fact, not only does it deserve NO stars, it deserves a couple of puking face icons, along with handfuls of rotten tomatoes!!

I seriously can NOT understand how this foul excuse for a movie is getting so many good reviews and high ratings. Either some of the other reviewers are totally blind, or they are completely ignorant of all the gross scenes, and the rampant stereotypes, and pigeon-holing of ethnic groups.

""East is East"" which is set in England during the 1970's, is about a Pakistani immigrant, George Khan (Om Puri) a vile, uncouth, and abusive man who is married to Ella (Linda Bassett) a British woman who is almost as repulsive as her husband.

George and Ella Khan own a neighborhood fish and chips restaurant, and they have 7 children together, most (if not all) of whom have turned out to be as vulgar and crass as their parents. Rounding out this misfit bunch is Ella's trashy sister, Annie.

Eldest son Nazir, was disowned by his father after refusing to go through with an arranged marriage, and literally, leaving his bride standing at the altar. After walking out of his wedding, and being thrown out of his family, all traces of him - photos, mention of his name, etc., were removed from the Khan house. Only his mother and siblings acknowledge his existence with secret phone calls made from distant pay phones to keep the father, George Khan, from finding out.

The other Khan children are far more disgusting. While one son, Saleem, uses his dubious artistic ""skills"" to create obscene and revolting pornographic sculptures and drawings, another son, Tariq, spends all his time sneaking off to discos, and making out with British girls, especially the daughter of a virulent racist, who's running for public, political office on an anti-immigrant platform.

Sons Abdul and Maneer blend into the background of this awful family with Maneer as the ""goody-two shoes"" and ""brown-nosing suck-up"" to their father, and are only significant in that, they too end up a target of their boorish father's violent rages when they finally try to speak up.

Daughter Meenah (Archie Panjabi) is, in my opinion, the least repugnant, and most likable of all the characters - which is not really saying much, since the other characters are like scum in the bottom of a barrel.

Being the only daughter in a family of six sons, Meenah is a real tomboy, often playing soccer in the street with the neighborhood boys. As has been mentioned, Meenah's acting abilities are the only saving grace of this film, if there is any to really speak of. It's just a shame that such a talented actress like Archie Panjabi has to be associated with such an asinine and ghastly ""film"" like ""East is East"".

Finally, rounding out this hideous family is youngest son, Sajid, who lives in a filthy fur-trimmed parka (a'la Kenny on South Park) and screeches at the top of his lungs when anyone tries to take it off. He is nearly as vile as his father, urinating on the walls of the local school, mosque, and other buildings.

The family in this movie reminds me of characters called the Thingumajigs, in a series of children's books (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thingumajig-Book-of-Manners/dp/0824954343/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thingumajig Book of Manners</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thingumajig-Book-of-Health-and-Safety/dp/082498031X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thingumajig Book of Health and Safety</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Thingumajig-Christmas/dp/082498045X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Thingumajig Christmas</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thingumajig-Do-s-and-Don-ts/dp/0824980506/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thingumajig Do's and Don'ts</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Santa-Visits-the-Thingumajigs/dp/0824966198/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Santa Visits the Thingumajigs</a>) by Irene Keller, that my mom used to read to my brother and me growing up. Those of you who know about those books, will definitely be able to identify with their human counterparts in this movie.

I would SERIOUSLY avoid this movie like the Bubonic Plague, which this film probably carries. This movie is just plain AWFUL!! Avoid it at all costs! It is a stereotypical pile of rubbish!

If you want to see GOOD movies about the Indian sub-continent, I recommend watching ""Bhaji on the Beach"", ""Monsoon Wedding"" or ""Bend it Like Beckham"". ""East is East"" portrays NOTHING accurate about Asians, or the Islamic culture in general.

Director Damien O'Donnell clearly knows NOTHING about Indians & Pakistanis, or Muslims, and its easy to see that he has done NO research whatsoever into the subject. No meaningful study of Islamic laws and teachings, and Asian traditions.

For one thing, in one scene, while the parents are out, the children cook and eat bacon and sausage at home. BACON & SAUSAGE!

Apparently the director, and creators of this film are too ignorant to know, but Islam forbids the consumption of pork!

Now even though the Khan children were eating the bacon and sausage in defiance of their father's Islamic beliefs, there is NO way that any Asian, Indian/Pakistani or Muslim child would eat it blatantly, out in the open like that, in their parents home. It would be considered like the ultimate disrespect and dishonor to their culture and their heritage.

So if they were going to defy the Islamic tenets and eat pork products, they would eat it secretly, away from home, in some distant restaurant, or other far-off place where they would not be seen. They would not disrespect their family, by eating pork at home where they would bring their parents shame and dishonor.

It is obvious that instead of doing his own independent research, director Damien O'Donnell has just taken all the stereotypes, myths, and mis-information about Muslims and Asians, and has just cobbled them together to make this movie.

""East is East"" is the WORST POSSIBLE film to use in developing an opinion about Asians. It is worse than a caricature. I have never seen anyone - Asian, Muslim, or otherwise, act like that - so loutish, uncouth, and vulgar.

Furthermore, I seriously wonder if the director, Damien O'Donnell, is some kind of fetishist. Because, even though this film is set in the 1970's, years after the development and widespread use of indoor plumbing, this family still does not seem to have it installed in their home, and there are excessive and graphic scenes of various characters urinating into chamber pots.

I mean, practically every other scene or so has someone going to the bathroom on-screen. Literally on-screen! It is just disgusting!! One would think that in the 1970's, they would be using regular indoor toilets instead of pots in the corner. Moreover, I cannot understand the director's need to constantly show people urinating THROUGHOUT the movie. Maybe he has some kind of urine fetish. That's the only logical conclusion. But, that he transfers that, into this movie is just revolting.

""East is East"" is NOT worth the time is spent in watching it. People will be better off watching a QUALITY film like ""Monsoon Wedding"", ""Bhaji on the Beach"", or ""Bend it Like Beckham"".

1099124,4,6305958076,"I have watched this movie several times, and each time I have been amused, and chagrined over how accurate the portrayal is of South Asians in Britain during the 60s. You have to understand that post-WW II britain had induced thousands of unskilled workers for their industry. These people were not educated, and many of them married locals. These locals were NOT middle class, or even lower middle class -- in socialist Britain, back in the 50s and 60s, there was still abject poverty. So what you see in the movie is accurate from both sides, South Asian, and the British.

George Khan is unable to reconcile the hopes and aspiration of his children with his upbringing -- even highly educated parents of today aren't able to bridge that gap, regardless of cultures. How often does an Italian marry a jewish person, or a white marries a black? By the way, I am punjabi, and I grew up in Pakistan, and I personally know families in Britain that are EXACTLY like George Khan's family.

Islam or its teachings has nothing to do with the portrayal of this family. The movie succeeds well in demonstrating George Khan's hypocrisy regarding his religion, his patriotism, his family ethics, even in choosing his wife; in one scene, he speaks lowly of all local white women, and when his son confronts him on why he married one, he ends the conversation by threatening to choke him if he continues with this line of reasoning. This is the story of one person's weaknesses in the context of different cultures. That's all. It's interesting to look inwardly for some people who are upset at this movie. I understand that embarrasment -- it's a good beginning. These people should watch this movie over and over again. It is cathartic not just for me as a punjabi Pakistani, but also as a person.

Om Puri who plays George is a fine actor in the tradition of actors like Lawrence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins. He really is a very fine character actor. He has acted in many Indian movies and some english. I will say this again, the family life portrayed in this movie for that period, given the pop culture movements of the 60s, and given the social class portrayed, this is a very accurate movie.

The Conservative Father seems to be the nexis of the culture clash at the heart of the story. He starts out as a sort of lovable Apu character--and then takes the rest of the film down with him as he devolves into a monster, complicating instead of resolving the central conflict at heart in the film.

The film East is East"" is very interesting because it shows a multicultural family, the Khans, and their problems. At the beginning you are involved in the actions immediately, because the conflict between the father and the rest of the family is represented very well. This conflict is about the Muslim tradition of the father and the rest of the family, who wants to live the British way of life. The father, George, forces the typical Pakistani tradition upon to all of his children. Therefore the children are not allowed to live their own life. The consequence is a strong and at the same time humorous rebellion against the father.
The plot is plausible and easy to follow. The film has a good mix between humorous and dramatic scenes. Furthermore, the variety of characters is the most positive aspect of the film for me. George for example is a character who is lovely and sympathetic, but he can also become violent. Each member of the Khan family occupies a different position along a cultural fault line. Especially the seven children have interesting characters. One of them is gay and flees from his arranged marriage. Moreover there is a party-loving rebel and another child is a very religious Muslim. The only daughter wants to live as a boy and loves to play football.
The only negative aspect for me is the end of the film. It is very superficial and does not fulfil the viewers expectations since you do not know if the father really changes his attitude.

It's absolutely hysterical to see the red-headed, chain-smoking British Bassett as she shepherds her very unBritish-looking brood.  But the film takes an unexpected and darker turn as George becomes more enraged at his family's disobedience and ultimately reacts with violence.  While his transformation is believable, there is never really a resolution to the tension, so I would recommend this film, but if you are wanting a flat-out comedy or a film that tries to answer the question of how to resolve multicultural conflicts, this would not meet the bill.
This is a barebones dvd, with an option for English captioning and a trailer.",1063238400,3,1044,5.076023391812866
1099184,5,6305958076,"If you happen to catch the trailer on another Miramax release, you might order the movie on the off chance that it'll turn out to be a quirky enjoyable comedy - I did, and it is.  However, the movie is MUCH more than what is portrayed in the trailer, and in my opinion deserves better exposure than it got.  It is a true comedy, but it tackles the very serious issues faced by multi-cultural and immigrant families, accurately portraying the conflicts between family, tradition, and society at large.  A movie that can be appreciated by anyone, it is certain to strike a special chord in the hearts of those whose traditions and values differ from those of the country they have chosen to call home.",1045094400,8,699,4.576
1099185,4,6305958076,"Much of the publicity surrounding this film rested on its comedy elements. And yet this is only half the story. The humour is terrific - ranging from coarse humour and cheap laughs to subtle jokes about dialect and the period on which the film is set. But the rest of the film is a mature, post-colonial take on the topics of immigration, integration, and miscgenation.
The humour in this film is great. The lovely Archie Punjabi and the boys supply most of this, while their parents deal in more serious matters. Om Puri convinces despite being a bit of a stereotyped Pakistani Dad, and the whole film glides along at a cracking pace, thanks to the humour. Despite dealing with serious subjects such as spousal abuse and cultural identity, the humour prevents any dragging.
Mr Khan has lived in England for 25 years, and this is significant because 1946 is the year before Indian independence, and a time when many Indians and Pakistanis came to Britain. The second great influx of Asians came in the late 1960s with the independence of Uganda and Kenya and their respective new governments repatriating the Asian communities. These latter immigrants would have formed the lion's share of the Asian Communities in Salford and Bradford, and for this reason Mr Khan is out of place with the recent immigrants (all of whom have more knowledge of Pakistan - formed after his departure from India - than he) just as he has not entirely settled in England (he still only speaks pidgin English, despite being there 25 years). Despite being entrenched in his ways and violent to his family, you can't help but have sympathy for this fish out of water and hope that he comes to terms with life in Britain soon.
I recommend this to anyone interested in the Anglo-Asian Community, but also to anyone who likes a good laugh.",1032739200,8,1813,4.7405063291139244
1099186,4,6305958076,"A goofy comedy with some serious moments; not that Im into these flicks but I liked watching how it may be like to be a first generation Pakistani in Great Britain.  A paki (Pakistani; English slang) immigrant comes to england and marries a second wife (a british one) because his first wife is in Pakistan; perhaps polygamy is allowed there(?)  The dynamics between this couple are fairly amusing; he would threaten the English wife of bringing in the first wife if there ever was a war between India and Pakistan.  The bulk of the film is about how his 4 teenage children deal with the strict old ways of the Pakistani father, who manages to get his 10 year old boy circumcised; perhaps a muslim tradition (?).  A fun comedic film on racial tensions/cultural misunderstandings with a dose of interesting british slang.",1032220800,6,820,4.753521126760563
1099187,4,6305958076,"This 1999 British film is about the culture clash within a multicultural family living in Manchester, England, in 1971. The father, played by Om Puri, is Pakistani; the mother, played by Linda Basset, is English. They have seven children between the ages of 13 and 24 and run a fish and chips shop in a working class neighborhood. With a mixture of comedy and pathos, we feel the father's frustration as he tries to instill traditional Pakistani values into his family. Naturally they rebel as they are being raised in England and don't even speak their father's language. Each of the children copes in his or her own way, and there are some moments of hilarious comedy as the father tries to arrange marriages for his sons. But behind the humor, there's sadness, and I especially felt sorry for the 13 year-old boy who is forced to be circumcised. Mostly, the children want to be English and when the father becomes abusive to the mother, even the son who opted to be Muslim rebels against the father.
Acting is wonderful. Om Puri makes the audience both laugh at him and understand his grief. And the rest of the casting feels genuine. I was troubled about a few things though. One was the simple fact that there was no indoor plumbing and there are a lot of scenes including urinating in chamber pots. Another was that the joke is always on the Pakistanis; the father looks like a fool over and over again. We laugh at him and are angry at him and even understand him a little bit. But he doesn't get any sympathy and we learn nothing positive about the Pakistani culture. If I were Pakistani, I'd be angry. I did enjoy the story and the acting. But it's a bit too painful to be a comedy. And it just doesn't work as a drama. I therefore can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.",1014940800,16,1784,4.492307692307692

1099189,3,6305958076,"How many of you think this is a comedy?  I rented this movie after seeing a trailer, with the distinct impression that it was.  It is not!  Who is responsible for putting the trailer together?  Whoever did it, what a deceitful job!  They took a few funny moments of the film, spliced them together and came up with this misrepresentation.  This movie is in fact quite sad.  It explores the huge cultural shift that takes place between migrs and their first-generation children.  In a sense, this film was not unlike The JoyLuck Club, for example.  It does a very good job at presenting how difficult it is to bridge the cultural and generational gap.  It also shows how hypocritical our parents can be in their behavior, and how different seven siblings can be.  Another plus is the great job that the movie does showing a blue-collar English town in the mid-seventies.  The acting is solid, the cinematography excellent, but do not expect a hilarious comedy by any means.",1011484800,3,972,4.720238095238095
1099190,2,6305958076,"This movie gets two stars because: a) Most of the actors put up a decent performance, and many moments of this movie were generally funny. That being said, this movie made absolutely no attempt to capture the real clash of culture and tradition that takes place when people from the 'East' migrate to the 'West'. Just to give some background, the story is about a family consisting of a 1st generation immigrant Pakistani father, his English wife, and their children, and the clash which takes place between the traditional father and the 'modern' children. The father is such a one-dimensional charachter. We know nothing about him: 1) What was his life like in Pakistan 2)Being as conservative as he is, what made him to marry an English woman? 3) Why do these two stay together, considering the horrible amount of abuse the father dishes out? We never see his point of view, except for one line in which he tries to explain to one of his sons why he is so harsh on them. That was it. The rest of the whole movie portrays him as uncouth, abusive and ignorant and nowhere does the movie attempt to show that any other form of South Asian man exists, i.e. that all people from the 'East' are like the father. Being South Asian, I take offense at this portrayal, as all it helps is to propagate stereotypes and racism against Pakistanis and other South Asians, which I don't think was necessary in this day and age. The movie makes a poor attempt capture the melancholy and struggle that immigrants go through in their new home. Watch it for laughs, but please, don't take this movie as representative of the South Asian diaspora in England/America, as you'll be doing all of them a dishonour. If this topic interests you, I recommend two movies, which are not so well known, but deal with the subject intelligently:
1)Hyderabad Blues
2)ABCD (Just released in theaters as of December 18th 2001).",1008633600,6,1894,4.673652694610778
1099191,3,6305958076,This movie starts out as a comedy and works well until it suddenly forgets where it is going and turns into a nasty drama.

1099262,5,6305958076,"This is not a comedy though I will be the first one to admit there are some hilarious moments in this film that are side splittingly funny. Set in 1971 in the bleak city of Manchester, this is the story of a biracial family striving to come to terms with their cultural identities. George Khan (Om Puri) believes he is bringing up his seven children to be good Pakistanis but there is rebellion in the ranks, because George's wife Ella (Linda Bassett) is English and her children are as much her offspring as they are their father's despite his attempts to forget this. This film is coarsely vulgar at times, with ribald jokes and innuendo galore but it is also heart warming and genuinely moving and the plot though loose in parts is pulled together by some slick acting and good directing. The storyline follows George and his family as they struggle to come to terms with conflicting interests, such as the headstrong Meenah (Archie Panjabi) whose idea of fun is playing football in the street and eating bacon sandwiches, to Sajid (Jordan Routledge) who hides behind the hood of his dirty waxed jacket, and has yet to be circumcised, much to the horror of his orthodox Muslim father. The film touches many subjects such as arranged marriages, what the right job is for a good Pakistani boy and how do you make East meet West with out a clash of the Titans. With rude words galore, garish colours and a rocking sound track ""East is East"" is a film that will have you laughing and crying in the same breath. I was raised in the North of England in the 1970s and remember only too well the outside toilets; the freezing cold bedrooms and the cultural divide between two worlds rolling toward a head-on collision. This is a crackingly good film (not for the faint hearted) with excellent acting from all quarters. Who can forget brassy Stella (Emma Rydal) with her eyes firmly on Tariq (Jimi Mistry) and her plump friend Peggy (Ruth Jones) who will do anything for a kiss and a bag of French fries? The DVD version of this film is excellent (with some good bonus material) but if you get the chance to see it on the big screen then do so, it's worth the few extra dollars just to see it larger than life.",1003622400,5,2204,4.5125

A massive hit in Britain, the film was somewhat ignored by audiences when it released here in early 2000. The film is exceptionally funny, and it's great to see a comedy that actually has a good deal of emotional substance... they're far too rare. The subject material is fairly original, and the film is carried off much better than the similar ""My Son the Fanatic"".  I admire how the film succeeds in making its point subtly. By focusing on the specific, arbitrary rules of a Pakistani, the film showed how arbitrary most parents' ideals can be.",999648000,3,666,4.842105263157895
1099264,4,6305958076,"I know people who were very offended by this film's portrayal of Pakistanis and I can say from my own experience that not all mixed families have the same problems as the Khans, but I still think that East is East is an excellent movie. The story is about George Khan, a Pakistani in England who married an English woman and begins to fear that his seven children are becoming too Westernized as they grow up. Anyone who comes from a multicultural family will be able to relate to the struggles of the Khan children to reconcile their father's wishes with their lives in 1971 Manchester. The movie isn't really for children and has a brutal and violent climax, but it teaches an important lesson about being at peace with one's decisions and growing up between cultures. On top of everything,the movie has a great soundtrack, with both English and Pakistani songs from the period and touches on significant historical events such as the rise of immigrant-basher Enoch Powell and the Bangladeshi war that may not be familiar to American audiences. All in all, it's an edgy, funny movie that will leave you crying with laughter and wishing it was an hour longer.

C'mon, we have seen people from SE Asia and arranged marriages.  And I have yet to see a British women getting slapped by a Paki husband. Those people who do not have any understanding of Islam and Pakistanis in general may find this amusing, others would wonder what Islamic culture director was trying to ridicule.  No wonder it did good business in UK.  Such controvercial topics are always good money-makers.  Most of the people watch such movies out of curiosity....",994291200,6,814,4.723404255319149

And if there is a family living out like depicted in this movie, then they are worst than any non-muslim and non-pakistani.  We, in Pakistan, have a deep cultural heritage and family values, which are unique around the world.  This movie shows the worst kind of family.  I am feeling so disgusted after seeing this movie.

First time director Damien O'Donnell appears to have gone to the Mike Leigh school, displaying a similar gift for very believable and affecting character development. Om Puri (largely unknown to Western audiences but a highly respected international actor) is superb as the harried patriarch of a Pakistani-English family in 1971 Manchester. Linda Bassett also shines as his English wife. The youngest son steals every scene he's in- with his ubiquitous hooded parka and a penchant for consistently bad timing, he comes off like a real-life ""Kenny"" from ""South Park"". Be cautioned: while there are a lot of chuckles here, there are also realistic depictions of domestic violence that some might find unsettling; however it is important to the story's arc.

1099268,4,6305958076,"What begins as a lighthearted and whimsical examination of the cultural differences between East and West escalates into a very serious and often dark study of the negative ramifications those irreconcilable differences can cause when strictly observed by those who lose track of the impact on those they love.
Om Puri is magnificent as Muslim George Khan, the traditional father of a very untraditional group of seven children, the offspring of his marriage with British wife Ella, played by Linda Bassett. Born and raised in England, his six sons and one daughter have grown to enjoy the high degree of cultural freedom not present in Pakistan. When George senses that he is losing the control of his family that he once enjoyed, he becomes an intransigent martinet and inadvertently manages to alienate them all.
Built on the foundation of quaint humor, the dramatic frissons, when they come, are stunning. And there's never a false note, as confident newcomer Damien O'Donnell directs Ayub Khan-Din's story with aplomb, a story which is partially autobiographical and based on Khan-Din's own play of the same name.",985737600,12,1118,5.148351648351649

But be forewarned: the cover box tries to pass the film off as a screwball comedy, but it's really anything but that.  It does have its funny moments, but ""East is East"" really excels more as a drama than as a comedy.  As mentioned by another reviewer, you watch the father figure George Khan slowly metamorphize from loving father into abusive tyrant.  It's a painful process to watch, but it feels 100% real.

Husbands can't slap his wife's face, etc.  This is purely George's own problems, but the movie made it seem like that of typical Islamic husbands/parents.",982627200,2,513,5.023529411764706
