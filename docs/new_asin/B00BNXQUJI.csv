8571769,3,B00BNXQUJI,"If you feel overwhelmed, Summer In the City can offer you a temporary break from life's insanities. It's a minimalistic, low-key drama following the aimless wanderings of recently released prisoner (Hanns Zischler) whose lead-logged head offers the viewer an opportunity to gaze at scenery, daydream, and slip into occasional zone-outs. The lead character (ex-prisoner) seems as if his bulb burned out long ago and is hoping that travelling and visiting new places will refresh his wilted existence. Sounds like a sad, pointless film to watch and a waste of time, but that depends on the perspective of the viewer. For me, the man becomes a prop. The bleak city shots Wenders provides indirectly places the lead character in a backseat role. His monotonous voice and drab personality lend him such a flat presence that one wouldn't even notice if he dropped into a manhole and disappeared for the rest of the picture.

This film unwinds at a slow, even pace for an audience content with observing passing scenery, random figures, and their simple day-to-day activities. The soundtrack contains cute, classic tunes from the Kinks, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Troggs and others that don't always suit the sequences they're paired with, so if the images leave you feeling less than impressed, you've got the music to carry you through. Depending on your attention span and frame of mind, Summer in the City might hold your attention  or induce boredom and drowsiness. If you're looking for something more involved and more fulfilling by Wenders, check out Paris Texas or Wings of Desire. (2.5 stars)",1479081600,,1593,5.076335877862595
