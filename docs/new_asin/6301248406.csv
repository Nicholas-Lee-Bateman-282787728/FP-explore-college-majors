1. Nasty
2. What Have You Done For Me Lately
3. When I Think Of You
This is the first VHS in a 2-part series.  I recommend you buy this VHS along with ""Control - The Videos Part II"" to complete the video set of the album that hurled Janet into superstardom (in her own right).",1018051200,6,318,3.953125
