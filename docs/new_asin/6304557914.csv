8194736,3,6304557914,"I'm surprised more people don't know about this notorious B-grade Gordon Liu classic.
Where to begin? The English dubbing is atrocious, with most of the Limey actors who did the job sounding like they're either bored, drunk, or both. The plot is of the cliched, predictable kind that's been done in other kung fu B-movies countless times (i.e., hero gets revenge on bad guys for death of father). Most of the fight scenes are badly choreographed, plus you can see the wires in some shots. The treatment of women is awful (in one part of the movie, Gordon Liu kidnaps the daughter of the enemy who killed his father; he then ties her to a wooden pole in his hideout and then leaves her to pee in her pants). What I can't believe is that I don't hate this crap. In fact, I freakin' love it! This flick would probably be great to watch while you were fried or drunk too, especially when the bad guys do the ""Dr. Evil"" laugh.",1081900800,,921,4.391812865497076
8194737,3,6304557914,"This small-scale Gordon (Master Killer) Liu starrer starts out interesting, then flounders with mediocire fighting and plot.  The fights are non-memorable.  The actual drunken style combat comes after a long wait, and while satisfying, is somewhat less satisfying than you would have wanted. You would expect more from Gordon Liu.",969580800,,330,5.58
