Thank you for your real approach in this era of great deception!",1353542400,,105,4.25
8257950,5,B0015ACQQA,As usual the teachings of Ramtha are so clear and accessible to everyone...this is a great dvd that is going to help you undoubtfully.,1246320000,,134,4.625
8257951,5,B0015ACQQA,"""Chaos is the Engine of Change"" is one of my favorite quotes from this video.  When contemplated it is such a profound statement, as are most of what JZ Knight channels via Ramtha.

Whether you view this channeling as theatrical, or as a sincere symbiotic relationship, makes no difference.  The words and ideas in this video are truly inspiring and should be given much attention.

This is wisdom in its true form and once viewed cannot be denied.  I have owned this video for over a year now and find myself reviewing it every so often when I need to refocus and re-energize my thoughts.

Alot of bang for the buck. Entertaining and enlightening. This video should be a part of everyones spiritual media collection.  I recommend this one with 5 stars.",1235779200,3,753,4.659090909090909
8257952,4,B0015ACQQA,"Ramtha, Our Evolution in a Changing World (in Mexico) is a good watch. I do, however, have other favorites by the author.",1232496000,,121,4.545454545454546
8257953,3,B0015ACQQA,"I saw Ramtha on Youtube and decided to buy a full length video. I enjoyed what she had to say. Since, I go to a Science of Mind Church, I am interested in how other metaphysical people compare to Ernest Holmes, founder of Science of Mind Church. Basically, I did not hear anything different. I still love to read or watch metaphysical material. It is very interesting. I have not heard messages coming through a channel before. It is worth buying if you like metaphysical material. The DVD does not make me want to go to her ranch and become one of her members. I do find her membership a little rigid. As far as the video is concerned, it was interesting. I recommend it.",1223164800,,672,4.384
