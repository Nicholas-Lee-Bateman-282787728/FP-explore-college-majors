A participants few remained until the end but most left. The theme was personally did not appeal to me,  however the dance was first rate as was the choreography.",1488672000,,330,5.111111111111111

8501689,5,B006O8K49E,"I found this at the library. I didn't know what to expect. It was an outstanding find.
There are four works on the DVD.

The full length ballet (about one hour) is Fall River Legend. From the dissonant
opening chords to the final percusive measures this score held my attention. The
choreography is well matched to the music. The period costumes (19th century) are
very attractive. The sets are slightly minimalist but everything that needs to
be there is there. Virginia Johnson performs admirably as Lizzie. I especially
admire her acting and facial expressions. The stern-faced evil stepmother was
performed by Stephanie Dabney and I cherished her performance. Everyone else is
good or very good at acting and dancing. This ballet is creepy. Five stars.

The Beloved is a short (eight minutes) work with only two people on stage. It
ends with the strangulation of the wife. The music is appropriate for what is
happening on stage. Five starts.

John Henry goes about 18 minutes and has a baritone soloist. The work downplays
the death of the title character and ends in a joyous celebration. This is very
Americana. Five stars.

Troy Game runs 20 minutes. There are only male dancers involved. The music is
minimalist. The ballet is mostly abstract. If there is a story I couldn't figure
it out. The men appear to be athletes and there is acrobatics and athleticism
woven into the dancing. There is some humor in this work which I appreciated
after viewing the tragedy in Fall River Legend and The Beloved. Three stars.

This was produced in 1989. The picture quality is good. The sound is very good.
There is no audience if that matters to you. We have a very nice compilation of
four completely different works on this DVD. Highly recommended.",1340755200,3,1748,4.8133333333333335
8501690,3,B006O8K49E,"This re-release of two movies about Dance Theatre of Harlem in 1989 are important as historic artifacts, but viewing of these ballets is somewhat dull. The artists aren't exceptionally good in terms of technique, and over-act in the dramatic aspect. The first ballet, Fall River Legend, choreography by Agnes De Mille, is a very dramatic ballet based on a tale of a girl killing her father and stepmother with an axe. There is a minimum amount of dance, and the majority of the ballet is for the over-dramatic continuation of the plot. The second ballet, Troy Game, choreography by Robert North, is an exciting and fun parody of macho-men. It is set on 17 male dancers, full of energy and good humor. The third ballet, The Beloved, choreography by Lester Horton, is in the same style of over-drama as the first ballet. With minimalistic dancing and a bizarre story, it is short and forgettable. The fourth ballet, John Henry, choreography by Arthur Mitchell, is a very energetic folk-legend, with singing and dancing. It's exciting and fun, though also lacking in dance. Overall, I wouldn't call any of these except the second 'ballet', more so 'modern dance'. The DVD features short interviews with the director, dancers, and choreographers, which provide a unique insight into the ballets. I would recommend this DVD to ballet collectors, fans of Dance Theatre of Harlem, or just for the ballet, Troy Game, which was by far the best.",1336953600,6,1435,4.933884297520661
8501691,5,B006O8K49E,"Dance Theatre of Harlem, founded by Arthur Mitchell AND George Balanchine, is a first rate ballet company and this dvd offers a nice, varied sample of their large body of work, only a small portion of which is available on video(please see my review for ""Fall River Legend"" for more information on DTH). ""Troy Game"" and ""The Beloved"" are exquisitely choreographed modern dance pieces and ""John Henry"" is a light hearted folk piece choreographed by Arthur Mitchell and the input of the dancers themselves(this bit of information comes from what cast members have told me). The DTH dancers are all clasically trained(in those days by Arthur Mitchell and George Balanchine himself) and this is quite evident in their dancing. This production was done in Denmark and is absolutely first rate in quality, from set design to music.",1327708800,3,825,5.029197080291971
