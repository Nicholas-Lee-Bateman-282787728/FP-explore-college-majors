8325848,2,B000W9SGXW,"i a planning a trip to turkey, and i wanted a few travel dvd's ...this series offered them,,  since i had been to the taj mahal, i thought that this  would give me an idea of the quality of the product,,,i was correct .it did , and it is JUNK! ,,my camcorder vids of the taj are better,,this is worth no more than $1.00 as a download,,i am sending it back to amazon,,the shipping may cost more than my refund, if they grant one to me, ,,don't waste time getting anything in this product series,,they make them sound great, but all are no more than 10 minute snippets... ,,they all seem to be the same amateur videos,",1242950400,3,616,4.256410256410256
8325849,1,B000W9SGXW,"I feel stupid because I did not check the playing time of this series.  I only was interested in the Taj Mahal and did not notice until receiving the dvd that it's only 10 minutes long!!!  What a rip-off!  How could anyone sell a dvd that only has 10 minutes of playing time???  These items should be $1.00, not $14.95.  It would be worth the money if at least 3 from the series are sold together.  I have never offered a review before on anything, but I feel compelled and angry enough about this purchase.  I sure learned my lesson - CHECK THE PLAYING TIMES!!!",1213660800,3,562,4.295238095238095
