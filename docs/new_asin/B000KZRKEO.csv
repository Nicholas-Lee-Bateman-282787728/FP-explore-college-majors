2699221,3,B000KZRKEO,"The DVD set I received was incorrectly packaged: the cover is ""Alaska: The Last Frontier"", but the 6 DVDs inside are for the ""Exploring Alaska"" set.

The DVD cover is ""Alaska: The Last Frontier"" - the 6 DVDs included are supposed to be:
- Braving Alaska;
- Bear Island;
- Alaska's Last Oil;
- Giant Bears of Kodiak Island;
- Over Alaska;
- Alaska: the Inside Passage.

However, the 6 DVDs actually included inside are Topics Entertainment's other set on Alaska, ""Exploring Alaska"", ie.
- Icy Killers;
- Alaska's White Pass & Yukon;
- Alaska's Wild Denali;
- River of the Bears;
- White on White;
- and unexpectedly a movie ""The Continuum""

I have ordered separately ""Alaska: Into the Wilderness"" which include the first 4 DVDs (Braving Alaska, Bear Island, Alaska's Last Oil, Giant Bears of Kodiak Island), and also ""Over Alaska"", and ""Alaska: the Inside Passage"". However, I did not order ""Exploring Alaska"".

So I thought this ""Alaska: The Last Frontier"" was a total duplicate of what I have ordered in the other 3 sets.  Yet this set turns out to be exactly what I did NOT ordered, ie. ""Exploring Alaska""..... and is $5 cheaper.

I thought about returning everything and ordering ""Alaska: The Last Frontier"" again - so I can have in ONE set all 6 DVDs I got now from three sets, and then order ""Exploring Alaska"" separately to have the correct cover.  But then the ""Last Frontier"" could be packaged wrong again, and the costs come to about the same or more after postage. It is not worth the effort. So despite the wrong packaging, I am keeping all sets I have ordered.

Quality documentaries, worth watching. I wasn't expecting a movie though as it was supposed to be documentaries on Alaska!",1370304000,13,1696,4.686868686868687

2699223,1,B000KZRKEO,You add this to your list onthe Kilcher family as if it is Season 1. It is very disappointing to pay for one DVD and it has nothing to do with what you wanted.,1355184000,14,159,3.7058823529411766
2699224,1,B000KZRKEO,"If you order the series ""Alaska: The Last Frontier"" about the Kilchner family in Alaska.  The series that has been on television?  You will, instead, receive a series entitled ""Alaska:  A Complete Tour of the Last Frontier"".  I have returned this incorrect series to Amazon (they were good about it) but see the series is still mislabeled.  Do Not Order This Series.  It is not what you want.  I am going to Barnes and Noble to get the correct series.  I will have to wait one to two weeks, however.",1353024000,68,499,4.466666666666667
