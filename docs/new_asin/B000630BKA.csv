Only problem is the change of dubbing voice in the last episodes...",1391731200,,253,4.142857142857143

8037770,2,B000630BKA,"Don't get me wrong.  Space Pirate Captain Harlock is one of the greatest anim of all times. The problem here is this particular edition. To begin with, several key scenes (mostly involving violence or nudity) have been deleted to make the show kid-friendly. If they were few of them, I guess the show would be watchable.  However, episodes such as ""L'etoile Filante de l'amour"" have been so censored that the few scenes left don't tell the story well. It gets confusing.  In addition, if you're someone who actually has seen the original version, you'll know what you are missing.

The other great problem with this DVD set is the music: they replaced the beautiful themes composed by Seiji Yokoyama and Ichiro Mizuki, with a new music score composed by Eric Charden and Didier  Barbelivien, and we're talking about a really bad idea. The new music is annoying; it sounds like an old 80's arcade game with all its synthesized irritating monotony. Hear it more than 20 minutes, and you'll start feeling the urge to bang your head to the walls.

Bottom Line: if you grew up with this version of the show (or you really want to have a Region 1 DVD boxed set of the ""original"" Harlock series  instead of ""Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years""), I guess this will do the trick.  Other than that, you should avoid this collection like the plague.",1196121600,4,1353,4.65546218487395
