The huge 1980s eyeglasses that Steinem and others wear will make some nostalgic and make others laugh out loud.

On the one hand, these are intelligent conversations between famous and articulate women.  On the other hand, it's an advanced feminist pulling ideas out of the throats of more amateur feminists.  Combating the stereotype that feminist activists are loud and irrational, Ms. Steinem is very poised and thoughtful.  However, in our days of shock jocks and sound bytes, it may come off as incredibly boring to many.  And one (inaccurate) critique of feminists is that they are tedious.

This work may feel incredibly dated to some.  On the one hand, Billy Jean King says she hates labels, and many people in our ""post-this"" and ""post-that"" times may relate.  However, she says, ""I am married to a man and had a relationship with a woman, so what does that make me?""  Steinem doesn't offer an answer either.  However, nowadays, in a flash, anyone would answer, ""Bisexual!""  Still, neither ""bisexual"" nor ""homophobia"" ever come up.  Plus, I had heard that Ms. King was a proud lesbian.  I guess that wasn't true in the early 1980s.

This preserves an important moment in time.  This is especially necessary for women and girls looking for she-roes.  However, it may be a yawner for many.",1175385600,,1464,4.8582995951417
