8337594,3,B001R99FXQ,"Unless we are donning fierce feminist hats, we rarely associate men with the gender requiring study or analysis - which is one of the main points and problems brought to light in Tough Guise: Violence, Media, and the Crisis in Masculinity. This documentary, written by Jeremy Earp and Jackson Katz (who is the primary ""star"", authority, and narrator) and directed by Sut Jhally, explores the largely neglected side of gender studies. Males are placed under the microscopic lens of Katz, who critically analyzes the way in which men and masculinity are portrayed in the media and its consequent reverberations on men (and, indirectly, women) in our society.

  The mode of Tough Guise is relentlessly expository, with Katz dominating face-to-camera time, as well as doing all of the narration. The only visual track that challenges Katz's presence is the heavy integration of various archival footage of movies, television shows, news stories, advertisements, music videos, etc., which supplement and illustrate his points and arguments. The cinematic variations end here, and the entirety of the documentary proceeds in a linear, thematic structure, with Katz introducing main points and then verbally analyzing them with the support of aforementioned archival footage. Although many of Katz's observations and analyses are interesting and insightful, his ideas seem to be the only ones present. It appears that he is well-educated and researched on the topic, but his solitary authority weakens the Ethos of the film; I was wishing that someone else would swoop in to validate his statements, present some kind of revealing supporting study, or that a paralleled observation would play.  Unfortunately, none of these ever appeared and the arguments, no matter how astute, remained one-sided. Katz also relies almost solely on Logos, although the predominance in this rhetoric is probably the best, most convincing method for the topic at hand. Pathos probably could have made a slight appearance in order to establish audience connection, but its absence is not as damaging as the offenses of weak Ethos and lack of cinematic variation.

  Cinematography and rhetoric aside, Tough Guise makes many intriguing and unprecedented observations about men and masculinity, and makes good use of archival footage in illustrating/supporting them. Katz is able to make his subject matter accessible for the viewer as well, taking on a more conversational tone most of the time and thoroughly explaining the deeper points and meanings of his analyses. Such main points like the social focus on the subordinate groups (minorities, homosexuals, women) instead of the dominant groups, the shift of men taking up more symbolic space as women's symbolic space decreases in media, and his scathing report of archaic, anti-feminism, patriarchal figures and popularized ideals in current media are poignant and well-illustrated and are prone to stick with viewers, as well as serve the documentary's revelatory purpose. Katz's authority on the subject comes through at these points, which helps to strengthen the feeling of validity in the film for the audience, which is imperative when the Ethos, as aforementioned, is thinly spread.
  Tough Guise is an important film in the gender studies genre, especially in the area of studying the commonly unstudied male side of the concentration. The dissection of masculinity and the media's effect on how men perceive themselves, their behavior, women, and who they should aspire to become is based on a solid psycho- and socio-analytic foundation, but could use more gusto in its Ethos and cinematography. This is a significant film, but is not the end-all-be-all; it should be viewed alongside other documentaries on the similar subject matter and perhaps even supplemented with written research on the topic. It is not a bad place to start, though, and provides significant insight into a complex area of study.",1374192000,9,3942,5.355411954765751
