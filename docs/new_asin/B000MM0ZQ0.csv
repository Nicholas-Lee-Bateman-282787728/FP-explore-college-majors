Also Mr. Godwin's voice is very somnambulatory and boring to listen to. Nonetheless this wouldn't be a bad buy for an unseasoned basketball player looking to improve.",1309305600,,310,4.654545454545454
8169864,4,B000MM0ZQ0,"Okay, I'm one of those guys who purchase tapes because my 11 & 12 year old play competitive basketball, and I'm always looking for good stuff. This is the first video on basketball that I have really enjoyed and the first video that my kids have watched all the way through. This guy is good. Once you get past the monotone of his voice, you began to recognize that this coach has a way of connecting to his listeners. He really lets you feel the connection that he really knows what he is talking about. You watch this guy and he has the game and the wisdom to help take you as  teacher and player to the next level.",1223251200,2,617,4.184873949579832
8169865,5,B000MM0ZQ0,"I purchased this DVD for my two sons ages 9 and 11 who will be trying out for a junior team this fall. I must say, Coach Godwin has got the keys to training successful players. My kids supplement their training by studying this DVD everyday. Coach Godwin has great skills and tactics that young players can grasp very easily, and he teaches them how to use the drills to improve their game. This was a great buy. I will continue to add his collection of training DVDs to my library!  5 stars!",1179964800,5,492,4.290322580645161
