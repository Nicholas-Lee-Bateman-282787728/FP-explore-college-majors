7913552,5,B00000JUEP,"Henry Tamburin should receive great credit for creating an instructional video that introduces a beginner to the exciting game of craps. This video will answer all the questions you may have about craps. He acknowledges that this can be an intimidating game for a novice, but his teaching style in a real casino with real casino personnel is very effective in allowing a novice to feel comfortable playing craps for the first time. He also covers all bets possible, and explains the etiquette that is usually not taught. In addition, towards the end of the video, he role-plays and goes through a complete round of craps until he legitimately ""craps out."" This video is easy to follow, informative, and entertaining to watch. Highly recommended.",1255392000,,745,5.016129032258065

I've always been confused by the game of Craps, this tape not only cleared up my confusion, it also gave great tips on how to win. I love it and would recommend it to anyone interested in truly understanding how the game works, learning how to play Craps and how to profit from it.",991008000,10,424,4.448717948717949
