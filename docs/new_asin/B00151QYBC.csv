It's more of a crime movie about a mafia boss played by Scott Baio with some nice rides in his personal collection. Whatz his name goes to work for the boss as a mechanic after a failed attempt at racing trucks. He f'ed up his Daddy's truck in the process and needs $$$ to pay off that debt. Of course, he soon realizes he's in over his head. There's a car chase involving a Mercedes and LAPD and a parking lot drift race involving a Civic, but other than that you don't see a lot of cars or street racing. Cinematography was pretty decent and you get some nice shots of Los Angeles as well. Acting was also pretty decent. It's a B-movie, but not too much cheese. However, way too much time was spent on the relationship b/w whatz his name and crime boss Daddy's little girl. Other than that though, solid effort. But if you are looking for some cheezy car-racing F&F B-movie rip off, this ain't it. For that, check out 200mph by the Asylum!",1519516800,,1064,4.298507462686567

8256938,3,B00151QYBC,"3 of 5 stars for this action movie. Our friend Mitch is a wash-out in stock car racing. Through a friend, gets a chance meeting with a high-rolling ""broker"" named Chase (Scott Baio all grown-up and doing the bad buy role). The kid gets hired as a mechanic for Chase's cars. The FBI has been closely watching Chase as they suspect he is importing/exporting illegal stuff. There is an FBI undercover agent who gets caught and killed. So the FBI turns to our kid to help them learn when a ""big shipment"" is due. Throw in Chase's sexy daughter who is hot for our kid and you have the story. There are some good driving scenes that are well created. Baio does a good job in this role. The kid is OK. Oh, did I mention the sexy daughter?

All in all a good movie and a great way to fill a Saturday afternoon. Recommended.",1254009600,,815,4.258064516129032

I mean, for crying out loud, you could see how poorly they cleaned the cars in this movie, let alone the fact that any of the car chases were obviously done at like 40 mph and just made to look faster.  Oh it's just a bad, bad, bad movie!",1229817600,2,349,4.0144927536231885
