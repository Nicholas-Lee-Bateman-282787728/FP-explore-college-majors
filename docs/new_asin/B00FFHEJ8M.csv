8615233,3,B00FFHEJ8M,"This movie is pretty much exclusively about the fact that the three featured fighters are Mexican. It starts with that as the primary focus, maintains it throughout, and ends without ever stepping away from that topic. It did talk about fighting, and it was good to hear interviews from these guys (which is why I gave it 3 stars), but this is for folks who have as much love of Mexican culture as they do MMA. Personally, I love MMA and don't really have an opinion about whether they are Mexican... so watching an hour and a half discussion about how tough Mexicans are got pretty boring for me.",1423526400,,597,4.486238532110092
8615234,3,B00FFHEJ8M,This isn't really what I expected....and to be honest I am kind of bummed that I paid money to rent it....I thought there would be more fighting in it....it is definitely more about the fighter...,1394064000,,196,4.628571428571429
8615235,5,B00FFHEJ8M,"This is an amazing documentary on 3 Mexican MMA Fighters (Cain Velasquez, Gilbert Melendez, & Miguel Angel Torres).  It shows their lives leading up to a fight and how they all have a similar mind set when it comes to their heritage.  It is very interesting in that most if not all the Mexican fighters share these qualities.  Everyone who is a fight fan should check this video out.",1386720000,,383,4.521739130434782
8615236,5,B00FFHEJ8M,A great MMA documentary featuring UFC heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez. If you are into MMA you will love this. Looking forward to seeing more of Bobby Razak's upcoming films.,1385942400,,178,5.172413793103448
8615237,5,B00FFHEJ8M,"Great documentary about 3 of the more prominent MMA fighters of the 2000's. Very informative about their careers, as well as their family and Mexican roots. Cain Velasquez is arguably the greatest MMA Heavyweight of all time, Gilbert Melendez is (according to ESPN right now after the diego sanchez fight) a top 10 MMA fighter, and Miguel Torres was at one point a unstoppable force--so this film should appeal to most (if not all) MMA fans. Its a little dated but something that MMA fans should  still give a chance to seeing this.",1383782400,2,532,4.720430107526882
