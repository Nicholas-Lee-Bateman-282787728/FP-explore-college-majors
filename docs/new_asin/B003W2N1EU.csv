8407227,5,B003W2N1EU,"I own this DVD (purchased as part of the 3 DVD set). The video and sound quality is extremely professional. There are plenty of close-ups and alternate angles available. Footwork is always shown close up as well as providing leader and follower perspectives and full body views. Other helpful features include the 'count' numbers on the screen, so you always know where you are in the move with sound muted in freeze frame-slow-motion.

Other nice features include `end of move' and `section/topic' summaries with demonstrations. Bonus features include footage of the original dancers in action.

These instructors clearly prove their relationship to original dancers and original Balboa and Swing techniques of the period.  Learning Balboa and Lindy together (as they integrate anyway) as an integrated system is a work of genius and can shorten the 'understanding' process that is often required when learning swing-dance, or developing from Balboa to Balboa-swing.

These DVD have been really useful in helping me develop my understanding and skills. I recommend this highly and often!",1349913600,2,1088,5.382352941176471
8407228,5,B003W2N1EU,"When I was first learning Balboa (after dancing Lindy Hop for a few years), this was the guide that me and a few close friends would use.  Once a week we would all get together, put the DVD in, and learn a few of moves that we would then practice for the rest of the night.  Needless to say, the JitterBal DVD collection was very well done, breaking down each of the moves step by step, then demoing the final product.  With every move they covered footwork, connection, weight distribution, and timing so that it took my friends and I only a few tries before we had the basics of the move down.  Definitely recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to try to learn swing dancing.",1349827200,4,678,4.31496062992126
8407229,5,B003W2N1EU,"I took some lessons with them when I lived in California. Since I moved, I've been able to keep up through their videos. It's amazing how much you can get out of them. Sometimes even more than an in-person lesson, because of the thoughtful editing, and the ability to rewind, slow down, and practice the moves again and again. They are such talented dancers, amazing to watch, and so clear at explaining what they are doing. Whether you are a seasoned dancer, or just want to hold your own at weddings and parties: highly recommended!",1299974400,4,534,4.631578947368421
8407230,5,B003W2N1EU,"This is going to sound weird, but I got this for my girlfriend as a gift and now I'm hooked! I never thought I'd be interested in Swing Dancing of all things, but my girlfriend wanted to learn and I figured I'd get her a how-to DVD for her birthday. I have always thought of myself as a kind of ungainly lummox, but after learning a few moves from this disc, I don't feel like that anymore. I have never been able to dance without looking like there's something physically wrong with me, so for ME to recommend this says a great deal. Not only that, but I find that my girlfriend and I can't stop watching the thing. We follow along and try the moves and it's surprisingly easy to understand. Even though we've seen it a bazillion times, there's always some detail we catch when we re-watch the DVD. It's very comprehensive and I feel like I've learned something new. There are a lot of DVDs on the market that claim to demonstrate how to dance, but I can honestly say this one really delivers. I'd love to know if these guys teach classes somewhere. Anyway, I highly recommend this disc for anyone that would want to learn how to Swing Dance.",1280534400,3,1143,4.345794392523365
8407231,5,B003W2N1EU,"So many instructional dvds are of poor quality - not just in terms of production but in terms of the actual instruction. Steve and Heidi are very clear and make it easy to see ""the moves"" in multiple formats, with and without music, with counts, and they've layed it out in way that makes it easy to rewind and review.  Additionally this is the only dvd I've seen that conveys a tremendous amount of technique vs. just teaching ""the move"". This is my default learning tool, even after many years of viewing.  I can't recommend highly enough!",1280448000,4,541,4.56701030927835
8407232,5,B003W2N1EU,"I picked up the beginner, intermediate, and advanced Jitterbal DVDs years ago, and I still find myself referring back to them for movement ideas and timing.  When my dance partner and I decided to start practicing regularly to improve our balboa, these discs were where we started.  They're well worth the money and the time you'll spend watching them.",1280361600,,352,4.9491525423728815
