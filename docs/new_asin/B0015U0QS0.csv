8259915,2,B0015U0QS0,"This video came up in response to a search for the movie Prudence and the Pill, along with some memorabilia from the movie. Shame on me, I didn't look to see that the DVD doesn't include the movie I wanted. The DVD features David Niven, the star of the movie. If anyone comes across copies of the movie, please sell them on Amazon!",1316476800,,331,4.26984126984127
8259916,1,B0015U0QS0,"This dvd tells about David Niven's Entertainment History, but, it does not include The Impossible Years.  I am trying to find that title on dvd and am not having any success.  You would think that they would have put it out by now.  I have Candleshoe, the Bishop's Wife, and others.",1272585600,,282,4.490196078431373
8259917,3,B0015U0QS0,"The Niven Signature Collection includes three movies and a selection of trailers. The three features: THE LADY SAYS NO (1951: she hates men and is `saucy,' yet Niven's a dashing fashion photog; with Joan Caulfield), HAPPY GO LOVELY (1951: she asks Niven to pretend he's Laird of the Keep, but he really is Laird of the Keep; with Vera-Ellen), and A NIGHTINGALE SANG IN BERKELEY SQUARE (1979: bank heist; with Elke Sommer).  Newspaper reviews said ""Lady"" was ""a limp comedy"" and ""Happy"" was ""featherweight yet charming"" and ""Nightingale"" was a ""quirky comedy"".  Folks, I suggest the wonderful ""A Matter of Life and Death"". In it, Niven accidentally doesn't die and when Heaven comes to claim him he pleads a change of circumstances - his newfound love for Kim Hunter.  Sony released it in startling rejuvenation at Martin Scorsese's request.  On DVD it's part of Sony's solid director set ""Michael Powell"".",1240531200,26,905,5.013333333333334
8259918,1,B0015U0QS0,"Thanks for the warning! I was also looking for Impossible years. This DVD appeared when I searched on ""Impossible Years."" The seller conveniently failed to list the contents. I'm glad some of you left a review on here, otherwise, I would have done the same thing.

Perhaps they might sell more of this item if they bothered to list the movies. Some of us are Niven fans and might have bought it anyway if we had known what was on it... but there is no way I'm buying something without a description.

I have a real problem with sellers who don't include descriptions or photos with their products. I feel if they can't provide the info, they shouldn't be allowed to sell on Amazon. And there is no excuse for Amazon doing this either. If the person responsible can't do their job, they should be replaced.

Thanks again for warning us about this product not having Impossible Years.

Not knowing what was on the DVD or if any of these might be on it... some of Nivens better films were ""The Bishop's Wife,"" ""The Satan Bug"" & ""Prudence & the Pill""",1239580800,17,1046,4.460732984293194
8259919,1,B0015U0QS0,"Like two others, I'm baffled as to why this is advertised as having
""The Impossible Years"" on the dvd. That is what I thought I ordered and was
VERY disappointed when it arrived with 3 movies I have never heard of. Still looking for ""The Impossibel Years"" if anyone knows where it can be found.",1235692800,13,294,4.363636363636363
8259920,1,B0015U0QS0,"I bought this thinking it had ""The Impossible Years""  like one of the other reviewers.  I've never even heard of these other movies.  I'll watch them, but I'm sure not happy with being tricked into getting it.  Why is ""The Impossible Years"" even listed with the discription??",1233187200,2,275,4.787234042553192
