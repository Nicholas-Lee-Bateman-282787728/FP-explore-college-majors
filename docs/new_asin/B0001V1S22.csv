2025126,4,B0001V1S22,We had The Amazing Book for our children on VHS when they were young. We lost is in a move and now have it again for our grandchildren to enjoy. I have used it them with my preschoolers at church and enjoy listening to them sing along.,1364601600,2,235,4.0212765957446805
2025127,4,B0001V1S22,Kids love it and I am very pleased with the DVD.  A very entertaining tool to teach kids about the Bible.,1357603200,,105,4.0
2025128,5,B0001V1S22,"I want to rate this dvd but I hate writing commentary for my reviews, but I have to write 18 words which makes me less likely to do a review.",1356825600,,141,3.7333333333333334
2025129,5,B0001V1S22,"I have almost no memory of my childhood, except this! So now, I pass this gift along to my son. It's one of the original pieces of art which helps/aids kids in understanding a bit about the bible. This are 3 separate DVDs in one case, each about 25mins. My son is four months away from turning 5. He loves it, and even me with my busy schedule took time off to watch it once again. Great packaging, great memories and the music and theme and message are true and constant and effective. It's nice that I was able to find this again. So simple but so effective for my kid and gets him making comments and asking questions. One thing at least, I know some lessons will stick with him just as they stuck with me. Seriously, it might not be 'techno advanced' like todays cartoons but if you can and desire to some help in your child forming interest in God and the bible and its stories, get it. God bless.",1351209600,9,902,4.219653179190751
2025130,5,B0001V1S22,My 2 year old watches this over and over again which is better than watching some secular stuff. Wish they made more in this series,1338595200,6,131,4.28
2025131,5,B0001V1S22,Bible stories told in a fun and engaging way by cartoon mice. I got this for my 3 year old. I had the VHS version when I was a kid and I still love it.,1308614400,17,151,3.342857142857143
2025132,5,B0001V1S22,"My son has loved these on vhs since he was a baby, first watching one at 4 months of age.  He loved the music and animation.  Now at 8 years I bought the whole set on dvd before a long visit to the hospital and these are by far the dvds of choice.  He goes back and forth between them and watches them several times per day.  They contain great stories from the Bible in music form and are educational. Anything to encourage a child's love of the Bible especially when it is represented accurately.  Most videos I won't let him watch over and over but I figure you can never get too much Bible especially now in the hospital.  It can only help his believing for healing.  ""So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God"".",1266451200,40,738,4.191489361702128

will teach them the word and each segment is not to long so they get bored",1425340800,,146,3.9

2025145,5,B0001V1S22,When cleaning out my old VHS stash form the early 90s I came across the Amazing Miracles tape and my son was hooked. I immediately knew I had to order a better less grainy copy since as a child I had worn that tape down!!! These DVDs have been on almost constant repeat since our mail lady dropped them off.  Both of my kids are dancing to Bible songs daily and I couldn't be a happier mom!!!!,1424822400,,393,4.103896103896104
2025146,5,B0001V1S22,"My 2 girls (ages 3&5) love these videos and enjoy the frankness as well as the music.  They love the ""66 books of the Bible"" song as well as the ""Amazing Children"" DVD that talks about how it's great to be a kid from a biblical perspective.  They of course just love the music and the stories.",1422576000,,293,4.12280701754386
2025147,2,B0001V1S22,"This is very short, has very little educational value and does not retain the attention of even the most mild child. Not worth the money. However the old Testament Bible series is amazing.",1421712000,,188,4.7272727272727275
2025148,5,B0001V1S22,Another older & cheesy video that my kids absolutely love. Wonderful Biblical stories & songs,1417737600,,93,5.266666666666667
2025149,5,B0001V1S22,"This movie is not intended to give children a complete detailed education about the Bible. It is an excellent teaching aid. The best thing about it in my opinion, is learning the books of the Bible easily through song. It is icing on the cake. If you want your children to learn about the Bible, don't plop them in front of the tv. Take them to church, or sit down with them and teach them yourself, give them the moral education they deserve.",1416096000,,443,4.349397590361446
2025150,4,B0001V1S22,I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the sound is a bit scratchy.  You can still hear the lyrics & sing along with it though.  Great for the kids!,1414108800,,161,3.7058823529411766
2025151,1,B0001V1S22,Very little content; poor graphics and sound quality. A disappointing purchase.,1413158400,,79,6.2727272727272725
2025152,5,B0001V1S22,This series was my boys favorite 25 years ago. So thankful to find it on DVD for my grandchildren!,1412726400,,98,4.2105263157894735
2025153,5,B0001V1S22,This is the only video my grandchildren want to watch. They ask for it as soon as they come in the door at our house!,1409875200,,117,3.72
2025154,1,B0001V1S22,"If I could rate this below on the negative star scale I would. This is not at all...not even anywhere close to anything good from in the bible. Don't waste your money...plus for those that it matters to there is a lot of new age symbolism in it. The songs are worthless. If you need a more refined approach than my rant.. my children who actually read the bible and go to a kids sunday school class ages 6 and 8 say ""mom what are the bible facts its supposed to be teaching? We haven't heard anything in it besides a cricket jumping around singing silly songs that don't make sense and don't really describe anything out of the bible.""",1403049600,6,635,4.3
2025155,4,B0001V1S22,"I grew up watching the amazing book and always loved it. I wanted to get it for my kids but all three here were cheaper than just the one. Although I love the Amazing Book, I was very disappointed with the other two discs. I didn't like them at all. Everything else is awesome. It's worth it just for the one DVD.",1398902400,,313,4.064516129032258
2025156,2,B0001V1S22,"Lots of talking, mixed with lots of distractions.  Does not seem appropriate for young children.  And I doubt the Tom-and-Jerry style action would hold the interest of older children -- it's just not that funny.  The lesson is overwhelmed with cartoonish distractions.",1395792000,,268,5.333333333333333
2025157,5,B0001V1S22,Catchy songs good quality and educational. Great DVD my son loves it!! Would most definitely recommend to parents to get it.,1393891200,,124,4.9523809523809526
2025158,5,B0001V1S22,"I think this series is just wonderful for children! But I say that as someone who grew up watching it as a child. The songs are rather catchy; even my wife (who gets annoyed by a few of them) walked about the house randomly humming the very ones she dislikes. -As I said... catchy! The animation can be ""cheesy"" at times, but back in the day was decent. I like that I can have my kids watch a cartoon that focuses on Bible stories and songs that help teach the stories to children. It was actually this series that helped me learn the books of the Bible growing up. I definitely give it 5 stars, but do so as a biased viewer. $5 for 3 movies, you can't go wrong!",1392508800,,662,4.1

2025160,3,B0001V1S22,"Even though it was a fast and free delivery, the description did not mention that the three movies are all less than 30 minutes. Great stories but lack of information was provided.",1391126400,,180,4.65625

2025163,5,B0001V1S22,"These are great little videos (about 20 min. in length) that teach toddlers about God and the Bible. It doesn't distort the message or the point at all, which I appreciate. The songs are very catchy and my toddler learns them very quickly. I highly recommend these videos!!",1389052800,,273,4.708333333333333

2025166,2,B0001V1S22,"terrible animation. seems to be mid-70's quality.. honestly.  Old Tom & Jerry was better than this.
tons of stuff about the Bible without actually telling any Bible stories..
not all all what kids need.",1385337600,,202,4.9411764705882355

2025169,5,B0001V1S22,"I HAVE USED THIS DVD TO TEACH MY CLASS (1ST-4TH) THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE.  AT FIRST, I LET THEM
FOLLOW WITH THEIR BIBLES. (CHRISTIAN SCHOOL) THE MUSIC IS SO CATCHY, THE STUDENTS LEARNED IT
IN NO TIME AT ALL.  THEY WERE MOTIVATED TO GET THEIR SEAT WORK DONE SO THEY COULD PRACTICE.  I LEARNED
THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE ALONG WITH THEM.  THIS IS NOT ONLY AN AMAZING BOOK DVD, IT IS AN AMAZING
PRODUCT!!
I'M ORDERING ONE FOR MY GRANDSON WHO LOVES TO SING.
