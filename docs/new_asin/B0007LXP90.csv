8048514,2,B0007LXP90,"So I was at work contemplating where my life went wrong. Then I wondered what ever happened to the clothing brand that made me feel like such a loser in 2nd grade for not wearing. So I decided to look up ""fubu"" on amazon. This deliteful little digital versatile disc popped up and I just knew I had to purchase! I even shelled out for over night shipping bringing my total from about $20 to $50 but hey whatever. So the next day I went into work and I couldn't even focus(which is bad because I'm a surgeon and I ended up giving someone a penile augmentation when they really wanted breast implants)  anyway I knew full well the snaps would be waiting for me when I got home sure enough as I pulled in my 2015 Prius I saw the package on my doorstep I was so excited I had to relish this moment so I waited until nightfall just staring at the DVD case and reading the back over 164 times. Just before I got in bed I popped it in and boy O boy did it show me what the streets are really like. I was like ""ohhhhhhhh snnnnnaaaaaaps!""
It only gets 2 stars because now I realize where all those yo momma jokes directed at me came from, just another thing I missed out on.. Also made me realize I'm even less cool now than I was in 2nd grade",1411084800,,1234,4.057377049180328

8048516,3,B0007LXP90,"Street Snaps is like an older version of the hilarious show with Fez from that's 70's Show called 'your mother'.

People get together on the street and make lots of jokes about each other that are often quite derogatory.

an example would be ""you're person hygiene is so terrible that your genitals smell like aqua life, perhaps you should shower or invest in some sort of douching device"" or ""your father is so obese that when he sits around the house, his breathing and heart rate are so irregular is causes genuine concern amongst those who care for him"".

I am going to be honest those aren't examples from the DVD but rather jokes I just made up off the top of my head.

I hope you enjoyed them.",1325721600,,700,4.403100775193798
8048517,2,B0007LXP90,"STREET SNAPS is so weak, when I put the disc in my DVD player, it kept automatically ejecting.  STREET SNAPS is so lame, when I went to Amazon . Com to buy it, my account was already credited $9.97 with the satisfaction money back guarantee already refunded.  This STREET SNAPS video has way more misses than hits.  If you like finding needles in haystacks, there's a few good one-liners here, otherwise most are uninspired and lack true creativity and wit. I'd categorize STREET SNAPS more like your mom, it's better to rent it than it is to own it.",1249862400,,550,4.5353535353535355
8048518,5,B0007LXP90,"I don't know what those other people were talking about. I don't know how many times Ive seen it, but I love watching it. Everytime I play it for a group of different people(many different races), because Im in the military, they're in tears cracking up! NOBODY Ive played this for thinks it's boring. FUBU needs to definately come out with a part 2!!! There should be ones in different cities. Im suprised more DVDs like this aren't out!",1140134400,,438,4.556962025316456
8048519,3,B0007LXP90,"It did get a little dry and generic.  Some of the comics ran out of material and I didn't necessarily agree with the matchups, but one of the comedians was just hilarious and the extras made it funny enough to be worthwhile.",1134432000,,224,4.333333333333333
8048520,3,B0007LXP90,"For the most part Street Snaps is an entertaining dvd which can be very funny in the begining but tends to get repetetive and corny towards the end. The first half hour alone is worth the price of admission but starts to wear thin towards the end, if the second half was as funny as the first, then i would have givin it 5 stars but it's still worth a look.",1115424000,2,357,4.042253521126761
