The directing, photography, editing and theme are groundbreaking.  Some aspects of the film are still being emulated as recently as in the film ""MUD.""  The movie has thematic relevance to modern life as well, by depicting life in America before the ""Social Safety Net.""",1396742400,,408,5.151515151515151
