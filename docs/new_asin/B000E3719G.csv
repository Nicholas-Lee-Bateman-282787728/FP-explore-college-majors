8104742,4,B000E3719G,"This is a pretty decent biography, for its length. Using the guidelines for stars, I don't ""love it"" because it would need to be a couple hours to make me that happy with it. This review is subjective, of course. My standards are fairly high for this particular subject because I am related to Boone and I want to know more about him.",1446595200,,334,4.317460317460317
