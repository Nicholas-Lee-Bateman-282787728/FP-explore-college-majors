8618874,5,B00FW79NH2,"The third episode of The Outlaw-Vengeance is Mine continues where the 2nd episode Enter Lillith left off and keeps the momentum going.  The story is very complex and evolving. It is an amazing film.  This episode has everything from Aliens, Alien spaceships, skeletons, dragons, action and great acting by the stars. The stars from the previous two episodes are in this along with centerfold model, Jolene Hexx. The heavy metal music is amazing and enhances the action on the screen.  Jolene Hexx appears totally nude in one of the most sensual sequences ever filled.  The music is fantastic and sets the mood for this film.  This amazing series has so much energy and is a visual treat.  The acting is great and Aceifer Genovese goes the extra mile to make this an exciting series. The special effects are excellent and enhance the story.  There has never been a film series like this one.  The sensual and beautiful Jolene Hexx is stunning. I look forward to the next episode.  This film is also available in a graphic novel as well.  I highly recommend this film.  Gary Evans",1384387200,,1078,4.741935483870968
