8348205,5,B001YXXRQQ,"What a great movie/documentary on cowboys gathering broncs and herding them over one hundred miles.  Shoot, the horses they were using were pretty tough buckers to get on to go do a day's work, but they got on and got the job done.  I enjoyed the scenery and commentary.  If you enjoy cowboys and that way of life, you will enjoy this movie.",1344211200,,341,4.380952380952381

The actual action filled film footage of Casey Tibbs, the incomparable example of a ""World Champion Cowboy, with his friends on the last great roundup & trail drive of over 400 horses  from the Lower Brule Indian Reservation to Ft. Pierre, South Dakota.  These wild broncos that Casey had raised were to be used in one of the muddiest rodeos ever held.  This movie is the true story with a little cowboy humor thrown in that makes this  movie one that  you will want to see if you are into real cowboys & rodeos.
It was Caseys lifelong effort to improve rodeo bucking bronco stock.  Like the 8 championships  he still holds in the PRCA, (hard to beat a 100 point score, especially on the very famous buckin bronco named  ""Old Necktie"" ), Casey  succeeded as you will see in the rodeo in this film of a part of the life of Casey Tibbs, one absolutely great  American cowboy, rodeo performer, and actor.

8348208,4,B001YXXRQQ,"First the Disclaimer:  I grew up horseback in SoDak and the Nebraska Panhandle.  I saw this movie when it was first released, at the Orpheum Theatre in Aberdeen.  When the folks drove us kids to Scottsbluff to visit the kinfolk we always stopped for pie in Pierre at a cafe that had displays of Casey Tibb's stuff.
  That being said, I think it is a classic period piece.
  The color and quality are not the best, but that adds to the character.  I reckon some people might think the narrative and obviously spliced in wildlife shots are pretty corny, in a ""Wild Kingdom"" sort of a way.  And Henry Fonda mispronounces ""Ft. Perre,"" just like everyone else.
  But if you are into the Great Plains, good horses, and getting Western, this is a good one.
  There are a number of Really Good shots of lots of horses moving through belly deep grass under a limtless sky.
  And when was the last time you saw somebody swim his horse across the Missouri River?",1286582400,8,951,4.4476744186046515
