8149577,4,B000JBXHX2,The price was right and this is a good DVD.  Overall I would not have paid full price but for the discounted price it was worth it.,1357430400,,131,3.8518518518518516
8149578,5,B000JBXHX2,"This DVD is by far the best Ford car related video I have seen in a long time, if ever. The crew who put this video together have taken the time to adequately research the history of the 3 cars presented in this feature. The presentation on the history of the Mustang is second to none and if you want an exact time line on all of the historical events surrounding the creation and production of the Mustang,this is it. Folks in the automotive media business need to realize that your average Ford enthusiasts is generally up to date on the subject of Fords and more specifically, Mustangs and we are not easily impressed. If you want a comphrensive and entertaining presentation on the Cobra, Mustang, and the GT 40, this is the one for you.",1327276800,,742,4.463235294117647
8149579,3,B000JBXHX2,"A decent video summary of the Shelby era at its peak. Some interesting information, but, of course, not quite enough depth for the serious gear head. I have never yet found a really satisfying history of deveopment, engineering details, the entire development path for any interesting mechanical toys, be they cars, planes, boats, whatever, presented in a video format, as the producers always play to the lowest common denominator...
If you like the cars, it is an ok piece that may add to your knowledge. If you are a mechanic, engineer or a driver, pass to avoid the voids, as it were.",1205798400,2,588,4.7745098039215685
