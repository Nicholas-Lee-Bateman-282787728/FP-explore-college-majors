3492762,3,B001BGS176,"I bought this at the Steelers store in Bethel Park, Pa in 2009, thrilled that they actually came out with full-games of these Super Bowls. I think Super Bowl IX is very good, Super Bowl XIV is near perfect, and Super Bowl XIII is almost as good as XIV. Super Bowl X was the best Super Bowl game until XIII, and happens to be my favorite, but I must agree with all the other reviewers that the quality for Super Bowl X is lacking. I don't consider it unwatchable, and agree with the reviewer who said the quality doesn't have to be perfect to enjoy this outstanding game, but it's hard to believe they could not have produced a better quality video, since whenever they show the highlights, they are absolutely perfect. I've been able to get several other games from the 70's on a website sportsgames on DVD.net, which I discovered as a link off Amazon. Some of these are as good or better than the ones produced by the NFL.",1377129600,,923,4.372093023255814

3492766,4,B001BGS176,"I bought this collection because despite being a Niners fan I have a great respect for the Steelers organisation. I had previously watched one of the superbowls in this collection which was posted on youtube.  It was Superbowl ten and despite the visual quality being a bit dodgy the game itself was thrilling and I loved how the Steelers defence just took the intiative in terms of winning the game.  Despite the warnings I hoped the quality would be better in terms of visuals...here are my reviews of each disk.

Disc 1 -  steelers  vikings

The first superbowl victory. Not a great game but dominant defensively. Worth a watch. I found the quality better than expected. Its not ideal as has been said but clearer than I anticipated...maybe my expectations had been lowered because of the reviews

Disc 2 steelers  cowboys

The steelers repeat...a fantastic game which ebbs and flows...watch; the cowboys trick plays, Lynn Swanns heroics, the Steelers defence intense pressure drag the team to another superbowl, Chuck Nolls amazing decision not to punt on 4th down and roger the dodger throw two hail marys -one of which hits the Cowboys never to be seen again WR Percy Howard on the head when he had a real chance to catch the ball....thus stealing the superbowl from under Pittsburghs nose. A thrillingly defensive and unusual game. Also some interesting post match comments including the legends Noll and Landry.  Visually...a disaster...unforgivable. Disgaceful....CBS should be ashamed in preserving it so badly...as should Warners in releasing it in this condition...

Disc 3 - Steelers Cowboys rematch

A great game that could have gone either way till the Steelers pull ahead near the end...before the Cowboys fight back! what a fantastic rivalry this was. A fantastic game. There is a lot of pre amble before the game but sadly no post game interviews...id have rather have seen the trophy presentation as opposed to Dick Enberg yapping. Visually...not perfect but very good and a world away from Superbowl 10.

Disc 4  Steelers  Rams

An ok game which was worth watching again but not my favourite. Good to see the last victory of this great team though and does take the story full circle.  Visual quality is very good and there are some post match interviews which is a good add on.

Disc 5 Steelers  Seahawks

Personally, I think its a mistake to put this one on here...different generation...should be a seperate package...why not have the AFC Championship games on instead. And why only five games???  And yet Philly gets 10?!?!  Same for the niners...just 5 greatest games...ridiculous...as for the game...its not  a great superbowl and in truth I thought the Seahawks got some bad breaks but then again Im not a Steeler fan....die hard Steelers will love this disc no doubt. The visual quality is of course excellent and there are no post game interviews.

I loved this box set. For me personally it was all about the battles with the cowboys...the intensity of jack lambert and that whole amazing defence.",1357689600,3,3027,4.936758893280633
3492767,5,B001BGS176,I bought this for my husband for a christmas gift and he really enjoyed watching the games. I brought back many memories from when he watched them as a boy.,1294444800,,156,4.233333333333333
3492788,5,B001BGS176,"As a 31-year Steeler fan, this collection is something I absolutely had to have.  (In fact, I just watched the SB XIII disc last Saturday.) I've read some other reviews containing complaints about video quality on some of the discs, but as someone who previously had to rely on memories, taped highlights, and finally, CDs (which were offered in the Steelers catalog back in 2000 or so), I'm thrilled to have these.  The only thing that disappoints me is that this collection is limited to the Super Bowls.  If the Cowboys, Packers, Giants, and Eagles collections are worthy of 10 games each, then surely, the Steelers are.  Right off the bat, I would add the ""Immaculate Reception"" game, any of the AFC Championship Game victories over the Raiders and/or the Oilers, and the 2002 AFC Wild Card shootout against the Browns.  There's also a 33-30 overtime victory over the Browns in 1979 that I would strongly consider.  Of course, I lean heavily toward the '70s dynasty, but that's what made me such a devoted Steeler fan in the first place.",1269475200,2,1041,4.7555555555555555
3492789,2,B001BGS176,"I read the reviews but ordered it anyway.  They were mostly right on.  I haven't watched all the discs yet, but, the first one was horrible.  I couldn't make out the players from the distance shot.  Up close was ok, but, I remember these games, and tapes are only from 35 yrs ago.  They show highlights from games in the 40's or 50's that are clear, so what gives with this?

That being said, I am an avid fan, and haven't seen these games since I was 12 yrs old.  So, it was fun to watch again.  I would say you must be a diehard fan to watch these DVD's, and thats a shame.",1266364800,2,575,3.982456140350877
3492790,3,B001BGS176,"Being a big Dallas Cowboys fan, I couldn't resist getting this Steelers Super Bowl collection. Now I own the two Steelers and Cowboys Super Bowls of the 70's which are two of the very best Super Bowls of all time. These are great games for any football fan and I enjoyed them immensely, even though my team lost. Unfortunately the video quality of the first two discs in this collection of the Vikings and first Cowboys Super Bowls are pretty bad. I did read all the other reviews that warned of this, but I still bought the set just to see the Cowboys games. I was hoping that the quality could be as good as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NFL-Dallas-Cowboys-10-Greatest-Games/dp/B001D7T45G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NFL: Dallas Cowboys 10 Greatest Games</a>&nbsp;set which has Super Bowl 6 from 1972 and the quality of that disc is excellent compared to these Steelers discs even though the games are more recent. It's hard to make out which players are which because of the shaky camera and the picture seems to go from light to dark at various moments and it sometimes makes seeing the ball hard and ruins some good plays. It's too bad that the quality is worst than an old VHS tape as these are classic games that should have been transfered to DVD in much better quality. On the plus side, the next two discs (Super Bowls 13 and 14) are much clearer and easier on the eyes than the previous discs. You can actually enjoy watching these games as they are as good as the original network broadcasts. And of course Super Bowl 40 against the Seahawks looks great as this was only a few years ago. So 3 out of the 5 discs are of good quality. I would definitely recommend this to any Steelers fan as it's their team and they'll love reliving the Steeler's dynasty of the 70's, even with the poor quality. But even as a Cowboys fan, I'm still glad I got this to see my team in two classic Super Bowls and the Rams and Seahawks Super Bowls were pretty entertaining as well. I just wish the video was better for Super Bowl 10.",1250467200,3,2073,4.697802197802198
3492791,4,B001BGS176,"My father-in-law received these as a gift, and I just watched IX yesterday.  Yes, the footage is closer to that of an older VHS tape, but far from unwatchable.  You can even see facial expressions quite easily on close-ups, although still not of tremondous quality.  If you have the games on old VHS tape and are looking to transfer them to DVD, I imagine you would probably get better quality just buying this set, which I believe is quite reasonable considering you get 5 games on 5 DVD's.  The only thing that I would have liked to see is some bonus material.  Hall of Fame induction speaches would have been great!",1238976000,2,618,4.531531531531532

3492793,3,B001BGS176,"This collection includes some PATHETIC video quality.  The first two games are extremely bad.  (Almost unwatchable.)  What did they use to source this? Worn-out VHS?  The older source material COULD HAVE been made better, but the NFL wants us to buy this set now before we re-buy a cleaned up version on Blu-Ray.

The radio play-by-play and color commentary would have been a nice surprise, but sadly we're stuck with no choice in the matter.  (only television broadcast audio is available)

In the end one of these games occurred before I was even born, so I guess I can't complain THAT much.  Eh, I just won't watch half of it.

I could only recommend this set to a ""completest"" and, ironically, that's exactly the person that would be most disappointed.",1238457600,,756,4.753846153846154

3492797,4,B001BGS176,"Yes, the video quality is crap (and could probably be a bit better, even given the limitations of the archival tapes), and yes, they should have included more/any of the pregame and postgame coverage.  All the same, this is tremendous stuff-- I had never seen SB IX in its entirety until now (I was only 3 at the time), and I hadn't seen the others since their live broadcasts, so I consider this $35 some of the best bang for my buck I've ever gotten.

3492829,1,B001BGS176,The video quality of the first two games is terrible and Warner Bros. should be embarrassed to release this package.  The product definitely does not do these great games justice.  Don't waste your money.,1235174400,3,204,4.970588235294118
3492830,4,B001BGS176,"Okay, here's the deal. If you've read the reviews, you've seen that several people have issues with the quality of the video. Some people have said that SB IX and X are so bad, they can't be watched. I disagree. The quality is poor at best, but if you're a true Steeler fan who wants to relive these Super Bowl memories, then I would recommend this video series. But understand the quality is POOR for SB IX and X. I would relate it to watching a VHS tape that has been copied a couple of times. We thought SB X was actually a little worse that IX. The quality of Super Bowl XIII and XIV is actually pretty good, and of course SB XL is perfect. I put off buying this DVD set because of the bad reviews, and then decided to go ahead and buy it knowing that the first two might not be watchable. Knowing that in advance made it acceptable for me. The bottom line is I'm glad I bought it.",1234915200,2,885,4.091954022988506

3492832,3,B001BGS176,"I can't believe that Warner and the NFL couldn't provide better quality recordings for Superbowls IX and X.  The quality is absolutely HORRIBLE!!!  I'm giving this three stars only because Super Bowls XIII and XIV are much better but not as good as they should be.  Also, Super Bowl XL is better on this set than the one included in ""The Steelers Road To Super Bowl XL"" box because you get the Al Michaels - John Madden audio instead of the radio broadcast.  But other than that, I feel very cheated!!! Warner and the NFL should be ashamed.  The fans deserve better than this.",1231200000,,576,4.5
3492833,3,B001BGS176,"This long-awaited set of the Steelers Super Bowl victories has a lot to be desired, but the bottom line is that for a lot of fans, this is either a slight upgrade over what they had on VHS or a first chance to see these games in any form other than the 30 minute ""highlights"" versions previously available.

The Good:
Until now, the only way to watch these games were half-hour highlight type videos/DVDs that we've all seen on ESPN a million times and don't really satisfy the fan looking to watch the whole game.  These are also the network broadcasts (no Myron Cope or Bill Hillgrove) so you get the ""national"" perspective.  DVD quality assures that they won't deteriate and become unwatchable like VHS will.

The Bad:
While these are the ""whole games"", that statement is very misleading if not a downright lie.  You get the GAME, but that's about it. It's easy to see that Warner Brothers spent no time or money to make this a true must-have collectible that it should have been. This was a hurry up job and it shows.  The games just start (no pregame build up), you get the plays, but all the ""extra"" time between plays is edited out (at least SOME effort was made to keep the commentary matched up).  This effort to keep things to a minimum also means no postgame either.  No celebrations, or trophy presentations.  If you're looking for something like a slick ESPN or NFL Network show of the game, you won't get it here.

The Ugly:
The early games are, well, downright awful in terms of video quality.  The original Zapruder film probably looks better than what we get on Super Bowls IX & X.  The transfer is just embarrassing for a major studio to put on the market in a collection like this.  It's obvious that there must be better quality available since we've all seen the highlights and other programs over the years that have been restored, yet for some reason WB chose not to use them or to clean up the tapes they did use.

Overall:
Football has certainly changed over the years, so has how we watch the game and this set really illustrates how different the broadcasts were.  This set presents the games at an affordable price, and while the quality is disappointing, it at least is a chance to view the games that haven't been available before.
Warner Brothers has also released sets for several other teams and while I don't know that the quality of those are any better, one thing I did note is that most also had other ""best games"" in team history.  Why wasn't the Steelers set peppered with a few important games (who wouldn't want to relive Franco's Immaculate Reception?) that fans haven't had the chance to see...ever?  Maybe we can send a few emails letting them know that if they gave us quality, we'd buy it.",1230422400,2,2735,4.526422764227642
3492834,4,B001BGS176,"Despite some quality issues (which are apparantly unavoidably when dealing with NFL archive VIDEO footage)these dvd's are a must buy for anyone interested in the NFL and NFL History.  Though it is a shame that Superbowl 10 isn't clearer, I still had no problem seeing and feeling the intensity of the Steelers knocking the snot out of Roger Staubach.  We don't need music and John Facenda and slow motion any more.  THIS IS THE FUTURE OF NFL DVD SALES !  WARNER BROTHERS, RELEASE SETS LIKE THE BEARS SET (which I also own)  The Bears set has 12 discs.  12 games from the '85 season.  IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE IN THE OFF-SEASON, A STARVING STEELER FAN COULD JUST GO TO AMAZON.COM AND BUY THE COMPLETE 1975 STELLERS SEASON.  TWELVE (or more)OF THE BEST GAMES OF THE YEAR, INCLUDING THE PLAYOFFS.  IMAGINE THAT.  1978.  1979.  HE COULD JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH THEM ONE A WEEK THROUGH FEBRUARY AND MARCH AND APRIL.  OR GO WILD AND WATCH THEM ALL AT ONCE ON 12 TELEVISIONS!  IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL THING.  (I am welling up with tears just thinking about the possibilities)  My point is this.  Quality be damned.  I don't care how fuzzy some things are.  I want it all to be dvd-ized so that we can have this stuff now before it disintegrates any further.  By the way, someone call ABC and tell them to release seasons of Monday Night Football because ABC seems to have taken better care of their tapes than CBS.  NBC is fair.  Warner Brothers, get to work immediately.  Start with the 1981 49ers, and continue from there.",1228694400,12,1514,4.5055350553505535
3492835,1,B001BGS176,"You can read some of the other reviews, but here is the deal:
The first 2 games on here are completely un-watchable. Yes, the footage is old. No, it wasn't filmed in HD. But theres no excuse. ESPN runs crystal clear footage of these 2 games all the time. Its availabe (somewhere).
Why any company would release this and try to fool everybody is incomprehensible.
The first 2 games look like someone recorded them on an old VHS vcr (with bad reception). Then used the tapes for about 5 years. Then connected another vcr and recorded them again. Then they transferred it to DVD. UN-believably bad. No excuse.
And i've read some other reviews that say ""well, the footage is old, what do you expect??....."". Then why does ESPN and other channels run crystal clear footage of these games ALL the time???
Games 3 and 4 are ok, not great, definitely not remastered like they should be, but watchable.
Game 5, obviously, is perfect. But thats already available on another DVD.
I waited a long time for this...couldn't believe it when i heard it was being released....and pre-ordered it. I read some initial reviews of the horrible quality, and i prayed ""please let it not be true..."". And yes, it as THAT bad, maybe worse.
PLEASE.....do NOT spend any money on this, this is pure trash, a disgrace.

3492868,5,B001BGS176,"First, let me say that I collect old sporting events on DVD and VHS.  I have several copies of these games, so I was interested in what the level of quality would be coming from an official release.  To be frank, it's about what I expected.  Four of the games are from the 1970s, so they're not going to be high quality transfers.  In fact, if you try to watch them on a large plasma, LCD, or DLP television, you're going to magnify the flaws.

That said, these games are most certainly watchable.  Put the game on a 27-inch full-frame tube TV, and it's fine (not high def, but 1970s fine).  In fact, the smaller the TV, the better the picture will be.

Unfortunately, when I received the DVD set I discovered that Super Bowl IX and Super Bowl X have terrible picture quality. They appear to be very poor 9th or 10th generation bootleg copies, at best. I have previous copies of the original broadcasts of these two games and the picture quality is much, much sharper than the versions included in this set. I wonder what source Warner Bros. used for the two games mentioned above? I can't believe that they got them from the networks. The picture quality of the other 3 games (SB XIII, SB XIV, and SB XL) is pretty good for the most part, although there is a slight picture degeneration for a couple of brief segments of the 2nd quarter of Super Bowl XIII.

I've found multiple versions of these games on the internet that put these ""digitally mastered"" copies to complete shame. Super Bowl X is almost unwatchable and Super Bowl IX? Oofa... The unfortunate thing is, this was a chance to 'get it right' and the NFL blew it big. I rated it one star only because I wasn't sure if ZERO stars would register a review here.

3492873,1,B001BGS176,"This was a highly anticipated release seeing how Warner was releasing 5 Steeler Super Bowls complete and uncut. First of all, the games are not complete. To speed up the game they cut a lot of the in between play commentary and sideline camera work. Maybe a small detail to some, but I see it as false advertisement. Second of all, the quality on these is downright shameful. I have recorded better quality from VHS of televised programs from the late 70's than these. It looks as if they transferred the games from a really bad VHS recording. Don't be fooled by the pristine crystal clear pictures of the various games on the DVD cover and back because what you get inside on the discs is horrible. Even the 5th superbowl quality is not what you would expect from something that was just recording in 2005. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh. I watched these games when they originally aired and the quality of the games back then wasn't that bad. Don't get me wrong, I understand about deterioration of film over time, but these are ridiculous. If you are a die hard Steeler fan like myself then these recordings might be of interest, otherwise I would highly recommend saving your money and look on Ebay or for someone that might have the original recorded games which I am sure will have better quality than this. Warner definitely dropped the ball on this release. Too bad. Definitely not worth the money.",1224374400,35,1411,4.603174603174603
3492874,1,B001BGS176,"I received my copy and attempted to watch super bowl 9 and then 10. The video was so poor on a 1080P top of the line plasma I wrote to customer service at Warner Brothers and was told that it was not a flaw, that was the best video that could produce.
I had purchased Super Bowl 10 on Ebay and it was at least clear enough to watch. The 9 and 10 games are worse than any video I have ever purchased. I find it hard to believe there is not a better copy available to the NFL.
I would not recommend this set for anyone.
Super Bowls 13 and 14 are a bit better quality and of course Super bowl 40 is perfect.",1224288000,11,604,3.84
3492875,2,B001BGS176,Like a previous review indicated - the quality of these games are below standard - there has to be better quality footage in the network vaults - these look like they were copied from a bootlegged VHS tape instead of the network source tape -- having said that -- it's still a great piece of history,1224201600,17,299,4.357142857142857
3492876,5,B001BGS176,"With the holiday season approaching and if you have a Black and Gold fan in your family this is a great gift idea. I personally picked it up myself for $22 at the Steelers Sideline Stores and this is just great. You get 5 (near) complete broadcasts of the Steelers SB wins. As I noted earlier with ""near"" you are missing pre-game, Network Intro, halftime, and postgame which I am overlooking but if you watched Super Bowl XL and watched the intro into Ford Field with Terrible Towels going nuts you get chills and that is not on this set so you feel kind of cheated. If you bought the Road to XL DVD set you are getting a second copy of Super Bowl XL, but buy it for the 1970s broadcasts. The Super Bowl XIII game is IMHO one of the greatest Super Bowls ever between Dallas and Pittsburgh. When you breakdown the product by price you realize that this is a steal and a great edition to your video collection!!!",1224201600,6,910,4.296511627906977
3492877,3,B001BGS176,"OK, I've had these games on VHS tapes for years. I bought this set seeking better quality which I did not get. I thought SB's 9 and 10 were fair at best. I thought my VHS copy of SB 10 was better quality than the one in this set. SB's 13 and 14 were good, but not great. Actually SB 9 and 14 were basically the same copy quality I already had. SB 40 was excellent quality which it should be being the newest.

If you don't already own pirated VHS copies already, you should buy these.
If you are like me already owning copies of these and looking for better quality, you're not gonna get it.

Also, why do teams like the Giants and Cowboys have more games than the Steelers, Raiders and 49ers? Ok this was released before SB 43, I understand. But, the Steelers have had many other great games besides the Super Bowls. What about the 1995 AFC Championship game? The immaculate reception game (which i'm not sure exists). The 1975 AFC Championship game vs oakland? The 1978 and 1979 AFC Championship games? How about the 1979 regular season overtime wins vs the Browns? 1989 wildcard win vs Houston. 1984 upset of 49ers and playoff upset of Denver? Just suggestions. OK I know they're are the 2005 and 2008 SB playoff sets.",1223942400,32,1221,4.398230088495575

8283218,4,B001BGS176,"After reading several of the comments about this set I thought I would leave my two cents. I have been a Steelers fan almost my entire life along with being a Cowboys fan. After getting this set it was great to relieve the classic superbowls from the 70's. Superbowl IX and X do not have the best quality but we are watching games from 40 years ago not in HD. But I will say they could have done a better job preserving and restoring Superbowl IX and X. All in all if you are a diehard Steelers fan that wishes to relieve the 70's Superbowls, then get this set without thinking twice about it. If you are worried about the video quality of the games the worst one appears to be Superbowl X but you can still sort of make out what is going on.",1454371200,,742,4.124137931034483
