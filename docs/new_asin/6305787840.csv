1071108,2,6305787840,"I thought this would be a good sequel to ""Twister.""  Was I ever wrong! The story line was poorly conceived.  The acting was just as bad.  If you want to see an action-suspense movie featuring tornadoes -- and, you  really don't care about ""realism;"" then I suggest you get the  original ""Twister"" instead.  Leave this one on the shelves.",966470400,9,337,4.627118644067797
1071109,1,6305787840,"Combine a trite script, poor acting and some badly animated scenes and you get this movie. Scenes are difficult to watch because of the comical score and impossibly funny situations (the lead characters engage in a passionate  kiss as ball lightning hails down upon them, the FEMA director seems to be  an ordained minister as well.) However, one highlight of the movie (and  deviation from the ""Twister-like"" script) was the inclusion of a  government conspiracy involving the Department of Energy. Bottom line: rent  Twister instead.",962928000,7,535,5.247058823529412

7894620,5,6305787840,"when i saw this movie, i thought it was very interesting.  it's just like the movie twister, where they go after these storms, and then storm chase these things, and then being inside the twister.  i think this is a remake of the other storm chaser movies.  i recommend this movie for everyone, that loves studying about tornados.",1384646400,2,330,4.655172413793103
7894621,5,6305787840,I bought this movie because there is so much to learn about tornadoes and this movie shows you some different things!! I enjoyed watching this high action video that makes you feel like you are right there with the actors!!,1367712000,,223,4.6
7894622,5,6305787840,I've been looking for this movie for years.  It is the best twister movie I've ever seen.  Not to mention that I'm a hugh Kelly McGillis fan.,1261958400,2,141,4.185185185185185
7894623,3,6305787840,"Movie wasn't totally bad or silly as some reviews say.  It was after all a made for TV movie and budgets are lots lower then the theater blockbusters.

The best part to me was seeing JAMES MAC ARTHUR.  Not only from 'Book 'Em' Danno fame, but from all of his wonderful Disney and young adult films of my youth.  I've always loved him and it was so great to see him on the screen again.  Hawaii 5-0 was too long ago.  James, your fans miss you.

7894625,3,6305787840,"With a title like ""REVENGE of the Twister"" one would expect this movie to be made in the 1950s along with other such films like The Monolith Monsters or It Conquered the World. And it really does fit the genre of B movie sci-fi. Zero production value, over the top acting, a pitiful attempt to have a character driven story, and a monster not seen until the very end because they couldn't afford the effects to show it. It's all here. Personally I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons. The movie is really quite silly to watch for it's ineptitude. Watch for James MacArthur (Danno from Hawaii Five 0) in his last and likely worst performance. And keep an ear open for silly self contradictory science.
Recommended for MiSTies and B movie fans.",1209340800,,743,4.552238805970149
7894626,4,6305787840,"Kelly McGillis plays Jamie Marshall a storm chaser trying to get over the death of her recently deceased husband.  When Colorado experiences a tornado in an area where they do not normally occur, she is sent in to investigate.  Jamie works very closely with FEMA coordinator Will Stanton played by Wolf Larson.  As Will and Jamie work closely together, the two are very drawn to each other.  When they discover a facility doing illegal experiments that involve clear-cutting the nearby forests, they may have to forfeit their lives to prove it.

I didn't think this movie was as bad as other reviewers.  You have to keep in mind that this is a made for TV movie, and not a blockbuster studio movie like Twister.  Of course the special effects are not going to be done up to standards of a Hollywood production.  I thought the acting was good, and not as scientifically lacking facts as Twister was.",1206316800,22,898,4.67515923566879
7894627,1,6305787840,"Horribly thought out plot, bad acting, unlikeable characters, technically inaccurate, cheap FX and a stupid love story sub-plot all add up to an extreme waste of time.
Bought this out of the 6.99 bin and I still feel I was robbed.
This movie's only redeeming quality is that it makes for a fun drinking game if you drink for every plot hole. (don't drive afterwards)",1086048000,7,366,4.6461538461538465
