8108343,3,B000ECX0BU,Inaudible at the start.....there were some interesting aspects......they could have edited it to a hour-long instead of its final 2 + hours,1512777600,,139,5.363636363636363
8108344,5,B000ECX0BU,"Until I scoured the extras, my reaction was that this was 'over the top.'  There were some interesting extra details about Father Sauniere, but there were so many other suggested possible clues -- to what? -- that it was absurd.  However, in addition to more details about Father Saumiere, there is a cd-rom with pictures and a halting translation of some of the paperwork associated with Father Sauniere's troubles with the bishopric. -- Louis J Sheehan",1197504000,,454,4.9605263157894735
8108345,3,B000ECX0BU,The narrator speaks about a priest and his treasures but was sometimes hard to understand. It keeps going on and on about hidden treasures and secrets. I was not sure want the point was because it wasn't clear from the beginning. I bought another video about the Da Vinci Code and it was a lot clearer from the very beginning.,1167436800,2,326,4.45
8108346,5,B000ECX0BU,"This DVD is not only visually pleasant but it is more informative than most of the other DVDs out there concerning the area of Rennes le Chateau.  It is given from a French perspective by French historians and writers from southern France.  It is a departure from Henry Lincolns hypothisis (which still has merit) and it dwells on the main character, Father Sauniere and a strange murder of Father Gelis a priest who lived only three miles from Sauniere and of course, a secret.  Taken with Henry Lincolns video, it gives one a much broader picture of the mystery....and more questions.  Which for me, is wonderful.  I love a good mystery and this one is one of the biggest mysteries in human history.  I loved it.  I watch it often.  There always seems to be some snipets of information that I missed.  I recomend it to anyone with an open mind about Christianity and perhaps, human origins.",1151539200,15,892,4.630573248407643
