8277845,5,B001AJVR0W,"Though it does not come on in my city anymore, it was a good show.  I looked  forward to watching all the mysteries presented on this show.  It was never a dull moment. Archie has been around for a long time.  The earlier shows were fine, but I like this show better.  The earlier shows had alot of singing in it with Archie chasing after Veronica.  This show has more of a supernatural vibe to it.  I wish I could purchase this as a dvd series. Also, I purchased this set for only $2.99 at a local drugstore.",1298246400,2,509,4.13265306122449
8277846,5,B001AJVR0W,"If you are an big fan of the Archie's or if this is your first time then this is what you been looking for and for those that are my age then you know what I'm talking about. No matter if you like their music or not go ahead and buy this dvd cause you won't go wrong. And when it says Weird Mysteries they are not kidding. So buy and enjoy.
