8469692,3,B003YDP0IW,Dick Slater was one of toughest men to ever step into wrestling ring and that's opinion of other wrestlers...he was one of my all time favorites...very convincing as MR UNPREDICTABLE...unfortunately this interview didn't come off well to me...lot of chatting but not many specifics about each promotion he was in...sadly he made very little mention of Dark Journey considering how great she fit into his time at mid south and how much heat she had..nice to see Dick Slater now but unfortunately I didn't learn much about his career in detail...Slater was one of the best performers in wrestling at that time...,1411516800,,610,4.990196078431373
