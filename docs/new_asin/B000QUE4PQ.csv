8197466,5,B000QUE4PQ,"Little My Maid was the first Adult Dating Sim I ever got and as I played the game I found that I was literally being drawn into it and I felt that I knew all of the character intimately.  The game is exceptionall well done.  Animation of the characters, their costumes and their voices are fantastic.  Background music and the story line are great.  This game is easy to play and it continously changes and unlocks new secrets and adventures as it progresses.  Game instructions are in English while the spoken parts of the game are in Japanese (this was the only thing that I wish they would change to English.  I rate this game overall with 5 Stars and highly commend it.",1307577600,3,673,4.430894308943089
