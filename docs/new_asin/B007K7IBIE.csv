5092608,3,B007K7IBIE,"Mellencamp's ""No Better Than This"" album will go down in history as one of his finest works regardless of its commercial success or any lack thereof. Recorded the VERY old fashioned way, Ampex reel-to-reel and one microphone in mono, in three locations (Baptist church in Savannah, Sun Studios in Memphis, and the room at the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio where Robert Johnson recorded) the filmmaker would have done well to let the story tell itself. It's an interesting enough story on its own, one that has caught the attention of many musicians, engineers and music fans who weren't even Mellencamp fans. Instead, he blathers throughout the film about something he set out to discover on the road. We the viewers never get to uncover what exactly this great thing is he set out to discover and whether or not he discovered it. Instead he winds us up with a vague promise of something big about to come and then rehashes said promise. How much better this movie would be if the narrating filmmaker had exercised the Hemingway rule of ""show it, don't tell it.""

Despite this constant annoyance it's worth sitting through in order to see the too-few clips of Mellencamp, producer T-Bone Burnett, and various musicians knocking out the familiar tracks. Recommended for all musicians and engineers. Just remember to be patient during the useless blathering.",1375056000,3,1354,4.93859649122807
5092609,2,B007K7IBIE,"I'm a BIG Mellencamp fan and I really been disappointed that John has never released a concert DVD, I saw this and thought ""great!"". The film starts off by saying it was made by a father and son team who have never made a film before and it shows! The HORRIBLE shaking of the camera's, the constant switching from color to grainy color to black and white is so annoying! Let the MUSIC do the talking! This may be considered ""art"" by some, it's just considered TRASH by me! Could not even watch the thing the whole way through, thats pretty pathetic since I own every Mellencamp CD from 1976's Chestnut Street Incident to 2010's ""No Better Than This"". I could make a much more excellent film of John and his band, just hook me up sometime John if your game.  GmanIV",1370822400,,764,4.380281690140845
5092610,3,B007K7IBIE,"A very talented performer and an interesting format for presenting his songs. The dvd was different than I expected, but was still entertaining.",1358121600,4,144,5.304347826086956
5092611,5,B007K7IBIE,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on here and say i liked this dvd very much. I just cannot complian about anything. The footage is great, the music is great, and the performances are as close to being there as it gets.  I know, I saw John and Willie and Dylan on this tour. The later two are not in the film but there is plenty of other stuff to keep you entertained. Awesome! Definately recomended.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Mellencamp-It-s-About-You-Blu-ray/dp/B007K7IBIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Mellencamp: It's About You [Blu-ray</a>]",1349049600,,602,6.0
5092612,5,B007K7IBIE,"I love everything about this DVD. It is really well done. Maybe its the artsy side in me, but I love the way it was filmed and narrated. Can't wait to watch it again. If you are a Mellencamp fan like me, this is a must have.",1341532800,7,224,3.7872340425531914
5092613,5,B007K7IBIE,"I saw this before a concert of Mellencamp's can't say I saw and heard every second but most of it like 90% i saw...the footage of the road is great, the places he recorded most notably Robert Johnson's hotel room were interesting to see, some old church think it was in memphis...obviously the songs were from his newest album definitely has a retro feel to americana post war but more like mid-50s feel...i will buy this when it's released and i'd recommend anyone who is a fan of john mellencamp will do the same...i can vouch that this is a very worthwhile release and is not filler or just something to pick up...it's a really good piece of art/entertainment/film/music however you want to classify this...if anything it will enhance the listening experience of the latest album and i will say it's a dvd you'll probably watch multiple times rather than just once because the scenery of cities and landscape is nice to see...you will see the places he actually recorded the songs and he did in mostly landmark places with retro recording equipment.",1336608000,18,1052,4.754098360655738
5092614,5,B007K7IBIE,"I enjoyed this film that came on before John came out on stage. the film was filmed with a 8 mm Camera that looks pretty cool. It shows footage of him when he was on tour with bob dylan in 2009, and the making of his new album. alot of the film is in black and white, but the film rocks. I'll be buying it. I do recomend any Mellencamp fan to buy it if they haven't seen it.",1335312000,9,374,3.7468354430379747
5092619,5,B007K7IBIE,"This is a nice behind the scenes look at the veteran rocker. It nicely straddles the line between a concert film and an artsy indie documentary. The videography is mostly done on somewhat grainy and beautiful super 8 film. Given this fact the regular DVD version would do anyone nicely as the Blue-ray version doesn't add a great deal considering the source. As a long time fan of John Mellencamp's music, that had drifted away a bit over the years, I found this to be the perfect way to reacquaint myself with one of my original rock heroes. There is some fantastic concert footage from a tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson (Dylan and Willie not shown) as well as some amazing intimate recording session performances for the album ""No Better Than This"" produced by T Bone Burnett. The film takes you into recording locations such as the hotel room where Robert Johnson Recorded as well as the legendary Sun Studios in Memphis in a way that will give roots music fans goosebumps. Director Kurt Markus waxes poetic about the american road along the way to great effect. The script is unplanned and events unfold to the film maker as they happen. Kurt does a great job making you feel like you are there. If you are looking for a slickly produced high definition documentary this may not be for you. If you are open to taking a journey into the world of roots rock that sometimes feels like a poetic dream, Mellencamp fan or not (yet), you will be well satisfied here.",1456099200,6,1469,4.568181818181818
5092620,4,B007K7IBIE,"This is a very cool travelogue  'Rockumentary' about John Mellencamp (and his band) staying true to his musical roots!  They even visit physical sites where American music legends like Elvis Presley and Robert Johnson performed and recorded!  It is filmed in Super 8mm format, and is grainy and low-res, which probably adds to the 'low tech' feeling that John is trying to convey here.  There are some honest comments and quotes throughout the documentary, with many live sequences of John and band in a studio setting (Sun Studios, Memphis!) of playing live.  However, given the 'low tech' recording, i'm not sure if I ever want to watch this again.  My 4K Ultra HDTV almost exploded!",1455667200,,685,4.913043478260869

5092622,5,B007K7IBIE,"I watch this one a lot, may wear it out someday! John is my favorite poet writer. His music is inspirational to me. Kurt made me laugh with his comments. He did a fantastic job on this and his comments right on the money the sad state of some places in our great country that were hurting. Also the part where John and Elaine were babtized was awesome. I would love that church and congregation.",1405468800,2,395,4.28

5092624,5,B007K7IBIE,"I recommend this DVD ... Well, the first reason is that I'm in it shown dancing in the audience ....woo hoo! Second reason is that the documentary itself was very well made in that old style feel that John was trying portray. The changes in musical styles from back then to today you can see and hear the difference when you watch this. This stripped down record that he created was an amazing listen.
If you are a true fan of John Mellencamp you will appreciate the style in which it was made and the artistry in the making of this documentary.",1395360000,2,545,4.352941176470588
5092625,1,B007K7IBIE,"I wanted a DVD of Mellencamp singing his songs. It is rare to see him on DVD. Instead this is a very rough (and amateurish) DVD about someone traveling with him. Way too much about the videographer and not enough singing. I suppose if you are a diehard fan that wants to see and own anything about Mellencamp, you might be interested. Otherwise save your money to go see him in person!",1393200000,4,385,4.361111111111111

5092627,1,B007K7IBIE,"If you have insomnia or sleeping issues in general I highly recommend the documentary on John Mellencamp called ""It's About You"". Absolutely one of the worst documentaries I have ever suffered through. It is so bad I would find more enjoyment in watching ice melt on a table. So terrible. SO BORING. Calling it horrible would be a compliment. Just f'ing terrible...but it will put you to sleep QUICK so if that is your problem then by all means go watch it. John Mellencamp really should have said ""NO WAY IN HELL IS THIS CRAP GETTING RELEASED WITH MY NAME ON IT"", it's just so so so so sooooooooooo bad. Really bad. Put this thing out of its misery and take it out of print. GARBAGE.",1383350400,2,684,4.436507936507937
5092628,5,B007K7IBIE,This is the movie I recommend to all film makers whenever they talk about shooting in Super 8. And Mellencamp and his music is outstanding.,1376092800,,139,4.6
8518747,5,B007K7IBIE,This is now a nation of idiots confined and condemned by the definition IQ between 0 and 25. So it is up to the reader to delete many reviews. I had difficulty with this purchase due to the reviews. After viewing the film I see the problem racism and Trump's defense of the KKK and Neo-Nazis some of his deplorable supporters were offended to the Black's in the film and the respect given to Robert Johnson. The film is a masterpiece. It reminds me of some of the early films of Robert Allen Zimmerman- Dylan. It is a film that can be watched over many times.,1525046400,,559,4.283018867924528
8518748,1,B007K7IBIE,"What a disappointment. The filmmaker would not shut up, even when John is singing. The visual images were so bad they gave me a headache. I'd rather watch bootleg concert footage of John Mellencamp on YouTube. And what's the point mentioning that John is on tour with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan if neither of them appear?",1519084800,,322,4.666666666666667
