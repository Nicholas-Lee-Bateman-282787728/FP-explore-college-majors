8546739,3,B00A4Y62I6,"I ordered this collection before knowing what the shows were and I will list them below:

1. Next World: Future Flight - this show is a preview of what travel through the air might be like in the future. As a Private Pilot, I thought some of the concepts were outlandish but the show was interesting and entertaining. The CGI/graphics, as well as the production of the content was great.

2. Black Sky: The Race for Space - this show mostly documents the building of Burt Rutan's SpaceShipOne aircraft which he entered into the X-Prize contest. There is not much content on the other competing designs but is a good documentary on SpaceShipOne. The production is of good quality and the footage is great.

3. Black Sky: Winning the X-Prize - documents Burt Rutan's winning of the $10 million dollar award for the first private group to build and fly a spacecraft which can carry three adults to space twice in two weeks. It shows footage of SpaceShipOne's flight to the edge of space and back. Great footage and good production quality.

4. How Stuff Works: Aluminum - focus's on the metal aluminum and it use in the construction and manufacture of aircraft.

This collection's strength's are its low price and focus on private/civil/general aviation. It documents the X-Prize competition very well. That said, there are no new programs in this collection. Most of the programs are at least a few years old. I was hoping for something that might show the future of general aviation aircraft like Cessna, and the big manufacturers like Boeing. I would recommend this to someone looking for a good documentary on the X-Prize competition but there isn't a whole lot of other content in this collection. For the general aviation enthusiast, I would recommend the Smithsonian's Air and Space Collection which a greater variety and a show on the Space Shuttle. Again, please read the list of shows to see if you are interested in this collection before buying.",1371859200,3,1954,4.82089552238806
