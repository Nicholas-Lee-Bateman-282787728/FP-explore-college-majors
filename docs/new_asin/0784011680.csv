72653,5,0784011680,"This film truly is a masterpiece. It's a crime Robert Downey Jr. didn't win the oscar for this role that he filled perfectly. The portrail of Chaplin does not skim over his faults. And although the film doesn't delve  too deep into Chaplin's darker side, it goes beneath the glossy surface you  are likely to have seen in biography shows on TV.

Touchs on all the  major events in the life of Charlie Chaplin.",964310400,2,409,4.486486486486487
72654,4,0784011680,"Though a great deal had already been written all about the world's most famous and talented comedy actor, here is a film to present his history in every frank detail for the very first time. After the opening credits where  the handsome young Robert Downey Jr. sensuously wiped his chalk-white  Chaplin makeup right off, the celebrated tramp's autobiography begins at  his childhood when the little moppet with tousled hair raced gleefully  right through the theater where his mentally unstable mother used to sing.  Then we are taken though the turn-of-the-century vaudeville days where Mr.  Chaplin first fell into love with a beautiful young girl and the  behind-the-scenes shots at the Keystone studios where he got his very first  break as The Tramp. Here we personally witness the steamy love scenes and  the scorching sandals and trials with several young ladies in Chaplin's  life. Then the poor long-suffering old man finally found his true love who  would continue to remain with him for the rest of his life and thus produce  many beautiful children with him, including the lovely Geraldine Chaplin  who would play the actor's mother in this movie. But the aging celebrity's  peace would be quite short-lived, for he would be so suddenly exiled from  the very country he himself had adopted and entertained for several  decades. But in the very end, the old Charlie Chaplin would return in great  glory to be lionized for his filmmaking deeds and his tremendous  contribution to the relatively short history of cinematography. A very bold  and insightful study of a much acclaimed actor yet a very sad and  frustrated man in his private life.",959126400,3,1653,5.007352941176471

72656,5,0784011680,It's a shame that Robert Downey cannot find more scripts like Chaplin.  This film proved to me that if Downey can set his mind on more positive things.

From his harsh beginnings, to his transition from silent films to talkies, and  his ups and downs on the way, it is all covered in this movie.  A  combination of the true history of the film era and an inside look at those  surrounding it.  Downey Jr. could not have captured Chaplin any better.

72691,3,0784011680,"Excellent production values, terrific photography from Nyquist, Bergman's legendary cameraman. All the cast is uniformly strong, with Downey a fine, physical Chaplin. Catch the late John Thaw (Inspector Morse) in a small part.

The weakness lies in the plodding, superficial scenario, a retelling of what is already publicly known about the protagonist. No insight or depth here. On the other hand, it's free to watch on Amazon Prime, and provides reasonably good evening entertainment,",1494028800,,486,5.5675675675675675
72692,2,0784011680,"I don't understand the high marks people gave this film at all. Aside fro the cinematography and acting, there was nothing good about this story at all. Chaplin's rise to fame was completely ignored. He went from pauper to star in about 20-minutes. I could say that the rest of the movie was about his relationships, but even those were just glossed over. In fact, I'm sitting here scratching my head wondering where the last 2 1/2 hours went. I also took an extra star off for the childish nudity. This was not about the life of Chaplin. It was about nothing.",1493856000,,560,4.5

72697,5,0784011680,"I consistently defy anyone to name a better performance than Downey Jr., in this film. I don't know whether it was his personal history, or simply the lack of ability among members of the Academy to recognize timeless art, that robbed him of his Oscar.
.
I wrote this review especially to say that I have been in love with Dianne Lane all my life, and I do not know of a moment in any film where her beauty has been so raw, and so powerful. In later years, Lane has become a greatly respected actress, but at this time she was still very, very young. She has never lost a single photon of her radiance, and I find her as stunning today, playing the elderly mother of Superman, as I did all these years ago. She is a walking and breathing Halleluiah to the spirit of eternal and incandescent loveliness.
.
If you have not seen this film, I truly envy you.
.
A final note:
.
Before you watch this, find ""The Gold Rush"", first, and then ""The Great Dictator"", and invest a bit of time In watching Hollywood's ""greatest ballet artist"" do his dance, in anticipation of watching the story of his life. Before the words ""that stuff is OLD"" can come out of your mouth, you will be laughing too hard to say them. And, perhaps crying,
.
You will thank me, I think, for knowing Charlie a little more personally, when you come to his own story.",1492905600,11,1331,4.285714285714286

72709,5,0784011680,"A glorious film about a glorious career. A flawed man lived a life all of us yearn for: one that made a difference in people's lives. Brilliantly directed by Richard Attenborough, Chaplin is brought to life through a stunning performance by Robert Downey Jr. I love the fact Chaplin found his soulmate late in life, something he called ""the happiest event of his life"" - true love transcends time.

How it is this movie is not more well known is a mystery to me. Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in ""Chaplin"".",1492473600,6,517,4.559139784946237
72710,5,0784011680,"Excellent movie! very well done, as always love Robert Downey's acting, he seems to always apply himself totally to the parts he plays. I am wondering though, why Chaplin never was prosecuted for sleeping  with under-aged girls? Geeez anyone else who get caught doing that is prosecuted! Guess his fame an money bought him out of his crimes, seems like he was just a dirty old man who liked young girls and got away with it!

72713,5,0784011680,Beautifully performed.,1491609600,,22,10.5
72714,5,0784011680,"I recently watched Chaplin on Amazon Instant Video. My overall reaction to it: all I can do is add one more voice to the overwhelming majority of positive reviews written about this remarkable biographical drama about Charlie Chaplin, the silent film star and one of the greatest actors of all time. This 1992 film, which was directed by Richard Attenborough, is based on the famous autobiography that Chaplin wrote and published in 1964. The film features an all-star cast that includes Robert Downey, Jr., Geraldine Chaplin, Anthony Hopkins, Paul Rhys, Marisa Tomei, Moira Kelly, and Kevin Kline.

In his Academy Award-nominated role as Charlie Chaplin, Robert Downey, Jr. is especially noteworthy not only for his acting ability, but also for the tremendous physicality of the stunts he performed throughout the film. Geraldine Chaplin (Charlie Chaplins daughter and a tremendously talented and accomplished actor in her own right) gives a masterfully poignant performance as Hannah Chaplin, Charlies mentally unstable mother.

William Boyd, Bryan Forbes, and William Goldmans adapted screenplay is especially interesting in how it honestly shows Chaplins greatness and the darker aspects of his life in equal measure. Chaplin is shown as a towering creative genius as an actor, comedian, producer, director, and musician. Having grown up in poverty and having attained great wealth through his own prodigious talents, he remained empathetic toward the less fortunate and generously gave of his time and money to help others. But he was also a perfectionist (sometimes to the point of obsession), and could be very demanding and temperamental. He married four times; his first three marriages ended in divorce after only a few years, and his fourth, to Oona ONeill (daughter of Nobel Prize-winning playwright Eugene ONeill), lasted from 1943 until his death in 1977. He apparently had an attraction to underage girls, and his sexual appetites at one point got him falsely accused of fathering an illegitimate daughter. His well-known liberal political stances led to his persecution by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and his eventual exile from the United States during the McCarthy era.

Chaplin is a wonderful film that I like so much that I recently added it to my Amazon Video digital streaming library. Very highly recommended.",1491436800,3,2333,5.317073170731708

72882,5,0784011680,"Because Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin had such a varied and eventful 88 years, short of being four hours in length, director Richard Attenborough's biopic of CHAPLIN (1992) is necessarily episodic. In fact, the original cut, taken from over 200 hours of material, was indeed an unwieldy double-feature long monster. Despite severe truncation, there are many high and lowlights in the finished product that illumine the world's most famous silent screen clown, a brilliantly conceived and realized work thanks to an all-star cast topped by Robert Downey Jr.'s amazing Oscar-nominated performance in the role of his lifetime.

(John Barry also received statue consideration for his ideal score.)

The story doesn't gloss over Chaplin's penchant for underage lovers, his clashes with Moral Majority types like J. Edgar Hoover (Kevin Dunn), or his complicated relationship with a mother, as portrayed by Geraldine Chaplin, who was more often in than out of madness.

In retrospect, Chaplin's immovable stance against ""talkies"" seems ill-considered, yet two of his greatest silent works,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CITY-LIGHTS/dp/B004OOL73W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CITY LIGHTS</a>&nbsp;(1931) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MODERN-TIMES/dp/B003ZYU3TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MODERN TIMES</a>&nbsp;(1936) were made well into the sound era, and he returned to filmed pantomime on more than one occasion well after these.

No matter its percentage of accuracy, for this film is based on the man's own selective autobiography, fans of silent era cinema should see CHAPLIN. Also those who enjoy star-heavy casts will not be disappointed with this modern classic. Consider this list of familiar (and for those depicted, legendary) names: Dan Akyroyd as Mack Sennett, Marisa Tomei as Mabel Normand, Penelope Ann Miller as Edna Purviance, Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks and Diane Lane as Paulette Goddard.

Also here are Anthony Hopkins, Milla Jovovich, Moira Kelly, James Woods, Nancy Travis and David Duchovny.
Archive clips include Sir Charles himself and many of his contemporaries, plus political figures like Joseph McCarthy.

72937,5,0784011680,"A few years ago when Tropic Thunder came out, a friend was telling me about how they thought Robert Downey Jr.s performance in it was great, but they still thought his acting in Chaplin was the best thing hes done. It wasn't until a few days ago that I finally got to watch the movie, and you know what? I have to agree. Robert Downey Jr. gives an absolutely incredible performance here as the legendary Charlie Chaplin. Not only does he look exactly like the Tramp, the way he acts in a couple of key scenes is something that guys like Daniel Day-Lewis would be proud of. I honestly haven't seen a single Charlie Chaplin film in full. Ive seen clips over the years, and saw part of The Great Dictator in my 10th grade History class (way back in 2000), but I never did  get to enjoy seeing the man in action. After watching Chaplin, I really want to check out all of his stuff.

Chaplin covers the actors life from childhood until when he delivered his acceptance speech at the Oscars. We cut between modern day Charlie, going over his life with someone helping him write a book about it, and the events that hes remembering and being more clear about. From his beginnings in a poor family who got by on fish head soup, to the beginnings of his stage career as he developed characters, to The Tramp and trying so hard to not ruin him by keeping him silent, even as motion pictures advanced into the talkies stage. The man had quite a life, and a lot of it is shown here. His relationships, hard times with people who tried to take advantage of him, and dealing with his fellow Englishmen when he retuned after becoming a big star, and was seen as a traitor by his friends who went to war while he was making movies. Chances are, if you're like me and know very little about the man, you're going to be pulled in right from the beginning, and stay until the end. Its a fascinating story.

Ill be honest- when I sat down to watch Chaplin, I wasn't planning on watching the whole thing. At over 2 hours long, I had a lot to do that night, but once it started, I didn't even look at the clock. The movie breezes by quickly and never drags on. This is one of those rare movies that I didn't want to end- everything was just done so perfectly. Of course, the main reason the film works so well is because of Robert Downey Jr. as Charlie. There were a handful of scenes where his performance had me floored, as well as wondering why more people don't talk about his portrayal of Chaplin. Everyone else does an incredible job too, even if they're only on-screen for a couple of minutes. Im not one to rave about performances unless they're really special, and thats the case here. Out of all the different parts of Charlies life, I have to say that former president Hoovers obsession over busting the actor is what had me interested the most. It was such a silly, stupid time in the history of our country, when anyone with even the slightest hint of affiliation with the enemy was hunted down and spied on. With how he was treated, you cant help but be on Charlies side when he leaves the country.

There was originally one little problem I had with the movie, and that was how Robert Downey Jr. looks when hes made up to look like Chaplin in his final years as an old man. I thought to myself man, thats a pretty sloppy makeup job. Then I looked up Charlies Oscar speech and realized that the two were indistinguishable from one another, and felt bad about my initial thoughts. So in that case, I guess they were still being accurate!

Biopics are always hard for me to review, especially when I have little knowledge of the person they're about. Its refreshing to not only get one thats great, but one that makes me want to go and learn more on my own- not just what I saw in the movie. If you have the time, watch Chaplin. Its one of the best movies Ive seen all year.",1418947200,3,3864,4.316804407713499

From Downey's part, I saw the lead as I had not previously expected: a very complex man with a complex and not so uplifting early life.  I found myself being drawn to Charles Chaplin beyond the iconic clown and his all too familiar props. For that, all credit must be given to the actor who played Chaplin.  In fact,  Robert Downey is the movie, as the movie does not play its role so well as the actor.  It seemed to wander and for that reason sent my wife to bed.

And ""of course"" you see a J Edgar Hoover who just wants to go after his political enemies ""because"" they are immigrants and communists--you know--the monster image Hollywood liberals have been making of him for decades now. And of course you don't see/hear any of the child molestation/indecency/philandering images of Chaplin--he is just a saintly, ""brilliant"" artist.

72986,5,0784011680,"""Chaplin,"" as a biopic, ranks among the best. It helps to start with a magnificent subject, who, obviously in this case, was Charlie Chaplin. And a fantastic lead actor, Robert Downey Jr. Include Paul Rhys, Kevin Kline, Marisa Tomei, Anthony Hopkins (as the fictional editor of Chaplin's real biography), Dan Aykroyd, and it becomes amazing. Adding in Geraldine Chaplin (Charlie's real life daughter) as her grandmother (and Charlie's mother) Hannah Chaplin, and others, and the movie becomes authentic and incredible.

Not all biopics are this good. Too many lay down a bunch of stories, almost independent of each other. Life is a process, not a collection of vignettes. ""Chaplin"" shows the process of Charlie Chaplin's life.

Where the movie most excels, beyond the impressive acting and period scenery, make-up and so on, is in the sheer story. It is well written and edited, Downey can be excellent. He, and the others, are not held back by a dodgy script.

Downey needs to receive extra credit for giving this thing everything he's got. Few roles require so much diversity of skills, and sheer talent isn't enough. It was clear than Downey did his homework before filming.

Summing up the life of such a complex personality isn't easy. The movie neither canonizes him nor castigates him. As brilliant as he was, Chaplin had his failures, and we see those candidly. His wife, Oona, played by Moira Kelly, was portrayed more doting than feels credible. Kelly, incidentally, also played Hetty Kelly, the woman Chaplin first fell in love with before becoming famous.

At 2:23 minutes, the movie still seems too short. I wish it were longer. I want to learn more about other friendships besides that with Douglas Fairbanks. I'm intrigued by why they thought he was a communist. His mom's story seems vague. So do certain transformations from upcoming talent to major star.

""Chaplin"" could have been a five or six hour movie and still have held its strength. Right now, this is all we've got, but hopefully, a remake filling in the rest will be made. For now, I fully recommend, ""Chaplin.""

73017,3,0784011680,"Before I watched this movie, I didn't know anything about Charlie Chaplin, only that his biggest character was the tramp. I actually found that watching this movie sort of destroyed the clean cut image of the Tramp that I thought I knew.
I grew up in the 90s so I watched talkies all my life, with lots of digital graphics. I am only just starting to get into the old classics Gone with the Wind, Ben Hur, some of the silent films. I have see a few of loveable tramp silent films.
Robert Downey Jr, I think did a fantastic job playing Charlie. As the Tramp he looked like Chaplin. His real life alter ego I am can only guess that is what he was really like.
While I would recommend this movie for purchase personally, at least not until you have viewed it first you might find it more to your liking than I did, or you might be just as disappointed as I was in the film.

Its not necessarily a feel good happy tale or slap stick comedy, but its one of those movies that you realize was a tremendous performance and very well done.  Could not have picked a better choice than Downey Jr. to portray Chaplin.  I feel that Chaplin is one of those icon's that most of today's generations don't know hardly a thing about.  This movie provided great and informative insight into Chaplin as a man and entertainer.  I feel a much deeper respect for Chaplin as well as Downey Jr. for having watched it.  I can't say for sure if Downey Jr was more deserving of the Oscar for this role rather than Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman, but its a very close second.",1399420800,3,804,4.391891891891892

However he was delighted with Robert Downey, Jr.s inspired performance in the title roll. All in all I think this is an exceptional well made film about one of the screen's greatest artist. The film does a good job of capture the life and times of Chaplin. The large list of actors do a good job and the film is beautifully photographed and wonderfully scored.

Most of what makes his life truly inspiring is not on here (except for a short little detail or two, like that lunch with Hoover). To make it all even worse, just as one gets into it, the story is interrupted by a present-time conversation between Chaplin and his biographer, which in reality never happened. Why bring an unnecessary gimmick to the film, as if Chaplin's life did not have enough twists and turns to keeps us interested? Beats me.
Robert Downey Jr. was perfect, and that's the only reason I give it two stars. Otherwise, those who truly know Chaplin's life, and appreciate his genius, will be disappointed as this film manages to skip all the glory, and focuses on boring details. How do you turn one of the most exciting careers into such a bore is beyond me. Chaplin deserves much better than that.",1391904000,,899,4.625

A generation of people grew up unaware of Chaplin's English accent simply because they never heard The Little Tramp speak. The impact he had on the industry is difficult to overstate, and Downey's portrayal was beautifully nuanced and true to the man. For an actor who had since earned a reputation for excesses of ego and other questionable behaviors, this early performance in his career is exceptional in its virtually complete sublimation of the actor in favor of the character.",1382054400,,551,5.133333333333334

73109,4,0784011680,"""While not highly regarded as some biopics of a high measure, Chaplin tells the interesting stories of the great actor, comedian, director, writer, philanderer, satirist, and entrepreneur himself from his rags-to-riches story of living in poverty in industrial England to making it in America.

The Chaplin biopic tends to focus much of its lens on his emotional complexities and social mishaps when he married and dated several women and having to deal with his work being the subject of controversy under a communist-fearing government and an anti-American, First World War-depressed British public and so much more. It almost makes you wonder the ""left-wing"" idea that having so much (money, fame, fortune) can often bring someone down if they are not careful. That axiom remains true and Robert Downey, Jr brings, even if American, a compelling persona to the legend himself and reminding that there was a uniquely human side to Chaplin than just the zaniness and slapstick he was known for.

While not factually accurate 100%, the Anthony Hopkins side storyline which shows him during Chaplin's years of ailment and old age is compelling enough that the interview element of the narrative is effective and humorous on some lights to indicate how his timely arrogance pursued all those years. The humour is still prevalent here and is notable in the scenes where he starts filming his great works (with the fast shutter-speed slapstick) and the satire is indicated (but not very highly) with his controversial film, The Great Dictator (if only they could have mentioned more about M. Verdoux, the one that really made communist-fearing America hate him). While not all that relevant, parents might find the PG-13 rating in this film troubling because there is quite a bit of sight of the breast nudity here than found in another PG-13 black sheep like Titanic.

While there is a lot to cover about this man, the film does not feel like it drags on much like the Capote film and the humour and novelty of his persona carries the film to a higher bar than I could have anticipated. Much like a recent film I've seen like this called The Artist (which focuses on a man's emotional journey in a transitional period from silent films to ""talkies""), Chaplin does that and even more and could have easily been silent if it wanted to?""",1380672000,,2331,4.926208651399491

First of all, Robert Downey, Jr. is amazing in the role - you almost can't tell the difference b/w HIM and the real Chaplin (similar to the Faye Dunaway/Joan Crawford resemblance). Aspects of his life are told/shown in a very creative way that is in line with how films were made/directed during his time - for example, the scenes where he and his associates attempt to hide in a hotel to finish cutting The Kid, and you see them running around, back and forth, at a higher speed reminiscent of how films from that area appear now. So, whether you're a Chaplin fan and/or a Downey, Jr. fan, this is a great film. Also, the soundtrack is phenomenal.",1380672000,,764,4.464285714285714
73111,5,0784011680,"A Classic. Why Robert Downey Jr. did
not receive an Oscar for this performance will forever be a travesty.  Only 26 at the time, his portrayal of Chaplin, is one for the ages. It goes beyond mimicry to the heart of the 1st globally known movie star's personal beliefs and stuggles, all deftly handled by another master of the craft. Much has been made of the movie's lofty attempt to include all of Chaplin's life and its lack of including more about his movie making  But it works because Downey is perfection in his portrayal of a man committed to his true love - movie making. If you want to learn about Chaplin's movies, watch them.  If you want to learn where his genius came from and his motivations behind his movies, watch Downey's genius in portraying him.",1380672000,,765,4.528985507246377

After that video, I got curious. I saw a few of the films and thought,""Neat."" Then, I came across this film. Not only does it hold the life story (mostly) of Mr. Chaplin, he's played by one of my favorite actors (Robert Downey Jr.).
The film goes over the life of Charlie Chaplin. From the humble beginnings as a child performer to the move to America to the Red Scare and ultimately his return to the US after the US kicked him out for suspicion of communism. Now, to warn parents who happen to be scrolling down, this does contain some nudity, which I would normally not approve of, but in this case, historical accuracy wins over family friendliness. Another note on accuracy, they get alot of it right, but they cut alot of it out as well. It came to the Great Dictator speech in the film and they cut half of it out, which dissappointed me.
Overall, I love this film. It's an incredible story of an incredible man who ate, slept, and breathed his art. Chaplin's a big inspiration to me seeing as I want to pursue an acting career myself... acting in cartoons, but acting nonetheless. But overall, it's just me. Want a clear verdict on the film?

Downey hits every note:  vulnerable, funny, tender, angry, etc.  The cast is full of wonderful actors, but one absolute stand-out is Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks!  Back to Chaplin...we saw how devastating his mother's mental illness was to him and his brother at a young age as well as how terrible it was to have to put her in a home.  It never got any easier for Chaplin to deal with her throughout his life.  He seemed to know early on that he wanted to be nothing but a comedian and was successful, but not well paid, until he came to the USA.  After arriving here, he discovered silent movies being made, and he could be successful in a profession that he loved.  However, his love life was another story until late in life for Chaplin.

Robert Downey, Jr. does not even come close to portraying Chaplin. Don't even get me started how Downey awkwardley protrays Chaplin as an old man( it was cringe-worthy)The make-up, I believe, was done by a 5th grader and his voice is all but a whisper.
Downey doesn't even fit the shoes as Chaplin when it comes time to show him at his glory days. He's wooden. His accent was that of a terrible ""highschool actor"" on opening night. The plot is snooze worthy. It drags on as it seems all other actors whisper their lines. It seems other boring Hollywood actors wormed their way in this film and Dan Akroyd is as annoying as he always is. Does he ever actually act instead of playing himself on film? Who's idea was it to cast this nightmare. His overbearing presence dominated scenes and all you could think about was how you still couldn't stand him (even Saturday Night Live he was terrible..yes, I said it)
Just because an actor ""might"" look like someone..doesn't mean they should play them. I don't believe Downey was ""experience"" enough to play Chaplin. He needed years of training and it showed as he flumbled during scenes.
I say: skip this movie. Watch Chaplins movies instead or read Chaplin's book. This movie is like drinking luke-warm tea. It's a disappointment from beginning to end.",1367625600,3,1438,4.665354330708661

It is a long (21/2 hours) and at times slow moving, and besides the amount of spectacle and as they say ""money on the screen"", it is most important because of the performance of Robert Downey Jr. It is hard to imagine anyone else with the talent both physical and intellectual, who could have taken on this role. The artistic conceit necessary to attempt to portray Chaplin is extraordinary, and the fact that he is able to be convincing to those of us who remember and revere Chaplin, is almost unimaginable. Any one interested in acting, film, art, history, or simply wishing to see a great artist at work, and to try and understand the forces that try personal achievement, should see this film.",1366502400,2,829,4.570469798657718

Be forewarned, despite its pg-13 rating, there is a scene in the movie showing a number of topless women in a changing room.  This can be easily skipped over with some planning.  The rest of the movie shows Chaplin as he ages through periods of social and technological changes in early to mid 20th century America.

73202,3,0784011680,"Every so often, when I look up the historical critical context of a film, I am surprised by what I find. Most often I see films that are schlock get undue praise, but since most of anything in life is bad (lest we'd not notice the good). This is not unusual. Then there are good or great films that are severely dissed. Almost every Stanley Kubrick film, post-1970, falls into this category. But, then there are films which are nice little films, not particularly bad, but also nowhere near great, that just elicit an off reaction from critics. Such a film is Richard Attenborough's 1992 film, Chaplin, on the life of filmdom's first true superstar. Is it a great film? No. It's a rather standard biopic, and pretty much in line with what the director did, a decade earlier, in Gandhi. Like that film, this one features a previously little known actor who `arrived' via a career-making turn in the title role. In Gandhi it was Ben Kingsley. In Chaplin it is Robert Downey, Jr.

  Most of the kvetching revolves around the fact that the film uses a flashback sequence, or that a character played by Anthony Hopkins is fictive, or that the film focuses too much on the personal and sex life of Chaplin. But, let's look at these plaints. First, that a work of art uses a standard technique does not mean that it is trite. It can be trite, or it can be used very effectively. This film splits the difference. It's neither here nor there in that regard. Second, so what that the Hopkins character was not `real'? Again, it's a standard technique, and like the flashback structure, the use of a fictive character is neither here nor there. Third, a biopic could focus on the art of an artist, if the artist was not a film star, to great effect. But, since Chaplin was a film star, the reason the film exists is because everyone knows who he is, in his art. Therefore, only hints of his personal life are fodder for any extrapolation. And the only nudity the film shows is a rear view shot of Milla Jovovich's buttocks, as she portrays Chaplin's first wife, Mildred Harris.

  That said, and despite the assorted sex scandals that littered his personal life, Chaplin's personal life was rather dull. The real flaw of the film is that which haunts most biopics, and that is it tries to do the cradle to grave schtick, instead of picking a specific period of the comedian's life, and expounding upon it. One of the best biopics of all time, Patton, follows this method. The DVD, by LionsGate, is the 15th Anniversary Edition. Despite that honorific, the DVD is not top notch. Yes, the film transfer, in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, is well done, but there is no audio commentary on the disk. This is an alarming trend on many DVDs, especially considering that the costs for producing them has dropped precipitously in the last decade. There are a few bonuses, but they are meager. There's a brief home movie of Chaplin and Paulette Goddard cruising on his yacht off the California coast. There's a featurette on Chaplin's life and career, on eon his life, and also one called The Most Famous Man In The World, on the phenomenon of Chaplin becoming the first truly global superstar. There's also the original theatrical trailer. The box for the DVD mistakenly lists the film's running time at 135 minutes; although it is 144 minutes long.",1359676800,,3322,4.612521150592217

Watch ""The Buster Keaton Story"" and you'll see the same thing: actual elements from a life well-documented that have nothing to do with reality or blended facts to create something they believed was more interesting and watchable. My thinking is, why would you invest money in falsification? What will they do to Paul McCartney after he is deceased and unable to defend himself from these blended fabrications? I had great respect for Mr. Attenborough before this film was made - I lost it after viewing this film. But as a Chaplin purist, these things bother me - as a film lover, the movie itself is very entertaining - I only wish Mr. A had stuck to the facts as there is NO reason to re-invent the Master.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Sir Richard Attenborough's biographical film CHAPLIN' is of the life and times of Charlie Chaplin, is a very charming, creative and ultimately moving insight into what made Charlie Chaplin tick and shows you why he was a genius and loved by people all over the world. Robert Downey Jr. does a really excellent job at re-creating Charlie Chaplin's graceful slapstick and getting inside the silent-film superstar's head over many years of triumph, defeat, scandal, official persecution, exile, and inner peace.

The film is packed with stars in small roles, as everyone plays second banana to Charlie Chaplin, especially Marisa Tomei, Milla Jovovich, David Duchovney, Dan Akroyd, Moira Kelly, and Geraldine Chaplin, just to name a few. The period accuracy is well done, and the acting is superb and just shows more of Charlie Chaplin doing what he does best in making people laugh! But of course it all showed the negative side when you see James Woods as a prosecutor working hard to nail Charlie Chaplin for anti-American sentiments and making Charlie Chaplin pay $75.00 a week in a paternity case.

To his credit, Sir Richard Attenborough shows `CHAPLIN' as the social activist who had an FBI files, close to 2,000 pages in length. The drama, at times, seemed a bit much for someone known for bringing joy to so many... perhaps, therein lays the irony of Chaplin's life. Seeing this film makes you appreciate why Charlie Chaplin was a genius, especially seeing Robert Downey, Jr. in top form in this Oscar nominated performance and ode to one of cinema's greatest artists who was the forerunner for such ""control freaks"" as Warren Beatty and Orson Wells. Writer, director, actor, producer, editor... Charlie Chaplin did it all!

As expected from a Sir Richard Attenborough film, CHAPLIN boasts strong production values. The editing and camerawork are smooth. There's a wonderful ""life imitates art"" scene where Charlie Chaplin is being chased by the police, and this couldn't have been better composed. The aging effects are some of the best I've seen. When Charlie Chaplin is old, he looks like he's being played by an elderly actor, not Robert Downey Jr. under a mountain of makeup. Veteran composer John Barry's score, while perhaps too reminiscent of his Dances with Wolves music, is evocative. All-in-all, however, even though CHAPLIN is fitfully entertaining, it fails to touch enough emotional chords to make it of more than passing interest.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Blu-ray appears to be derived from the same transfer used for the LIONSGATE 2008 inferior NTSC DVD. The greater resolution afforded by Blu-ray is something of a revelation. In the earlier scenes in England, detail is noticeably improved and colour delineation is superior. You can make out individual faces in images such as the music hall and vaudeville audiences, as well as different articles of clothing in medium shots. But overall the picture remains soft and sometimes almost mushy, and one begins to worry that perhaps the transfer was flawed in a way that DVD's resolution concealed. When Charlie Chaplin steps off the train at Mack Sennett's studio, and snap! The entire photographic style changes. Without calling too much attention to themselves (without, in other words, looking like a Tony Scott or Michael Bay film), images become crisp and finely detailed, and the colours become subtly brighter and less faded. Charlie Chaplin may not know it yet, but he's just taken the step that will change his life, and Sven Nykvist's cinematography registers the transformation. Until now, the film hasn't been available in a home video format capable of fully presenting this transition, which registers unconsciously, unless you're looking for it. Black levels are excellent, and check out those tuxedos, and the film's grain structure appears to be intact and unreduced. Having been completed in an era before digital intermediates were standard practice, the film has been transferred from an analogue source, and close attention reveals the occasional ""pulsing"" instability caused by gate weave. However, this is minor and will probably not be noticed by most viewers.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  When I viewed the previous inferior NTSC DVD, I was impressed with the improvements caused by matrix-encoding the 2.0 Dolby Digital track. At the time, I didn't think CHAPLIN's soundtrack could be improved short of a discrete remix from original elements. I stand corrected. The DTS and the 2.0 track on the Blu-ray gives John Barry's haunting score an increased presence and musicality that adds to the film's emotional weight. However, I recommend playing the track through front left and right speakers only, the track tended to ""bleed"" into the surrounds more than I found desirable. As always with such matters, individual tastes and listening spaces will vary. Dialogue remains clear, as has generally been the case with CHAPLIN. Surround effects are not a significant factor with this film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The only real Negative aspect of this excellent Blu-ray is that the extras are shown in the most ridiculous aspect, as you get this small image at the top left hand part of my flat screen Television and I don't know what idiot who produced this ludicrous nonsense and thought it was at all very clever, but to me it is totally ridiculous and I cannot understand why other peoples Reviews have NOT pointed out this ridiculous situation, as I feel it has spoiled what is otherwise an excellent film on CHAPLIN' and again I don't know how LIONSGATE thought this was a professional job, in fact it was a very unprofessional crass action.

Includes 3 documentaries plus a rare home movie of Charlie Chaplin:

Special Feature: ""All at Sea"" home movie of Charlie Chaplin vacationing in Catalina, California [1080p] [2:27] Rare home movie footage from 1933, shot by Alistair Cooke, then a college student, on Chaplin's boat. It shows Chaplin in private moments, although it also shows how little he could resist the impulse to perform whenever a camera was on. The original footage is 4:3, but it has been pillar boxed for presentation in a 16:9 frame.

Special Feature: ""Strolling into the Sunset"" documentary with Director Sir Richard Attenborough [1080p] [7: 30] Contemporary interviews with Sir Richard Attenborough, Chaplin's son Michael, film critic Richard Schickel and Chaplin biographer David Robinson, whose book supplied raw material for the film, about the film's genesis and the breakthrough that Downey's casting represented. Sir Richard Attenborough is candid about what he thinks he didn't get right and says he'd like to make the film all over again.

Special Feature: ""Chaplin the Hero"" documentary on Charlie Chaplin's contributions to film [1080p] [6:00] A reminiscence of a great career, with a mixture of vintage clips and 'Chaplin' footage alongside numerous interview snippets.

Special Feature: ""The Most Famous Man in the World"" documentary on Charlie Chaplin's status as a pop icon [1080p] [5:00] A continuation of sorts of the above feature, again reminiscing about Charlie Chaplin. I don't see why this needed to be a separate feature.

Theatrical Trailer [1992] [2:00] If you listen to the voiceover, you can hear the marketing department struggling for a hook to sell the film. ""Chaaaaaarrrrrrliiiiie!""

Finally, 'CHAPLIN' isn't a perfect film, nor is it among the top biopics ever made. It is, however, the home of one of the best biopic acting performances out there. Robert Downey Jr. is a fantastic Charlie Chaplin, and watching him recreate the classic, most memorable scenes. Despite slight negative aspects of this Blu-ray, it is still an excellent film and another aspect that is wrong about this Blu-ray disc is that Amazon on both sides of the Atlantic, says that it is just one Region, well I can tell you that information is totally wrong, as it is as stated on the Back Cover that it is All Regions. Highly Recommended!

73219,5,0784011680,"Today we know Robert Downey Jr for playing Tony Stark in the ""Iron Man"" movies or Sherlock Holmes in the new action blockbuster franchise but before all that he had a subdued yet close to brilliant portrayal as the legendary Charlie Chaplin, who was in his day bigger and more popular than most of our current A list actors and actresses. Some say Chaplin was the first actor to open up the world market and the isolating affect it had on him is explored in this film. Incidentally, Chaplin was considered the most famous film star worldwide during World War I.

This 1992 film explores Chaplin's rise to stardom going from acting troupes to taking a job in America in silent films and his gradual control over later films (some not so popular at the time like ""The Great Dictator""), as well as his turbulent romances/marriages (especially the ugly and controversial paternity lawsuit a la Joan Barry) to finally finding the right one. We also get a look into his many pictorial roles, his co-founding of United Artists as well as how McCarthyism ended up fracturing his career and having him move to Switzerland for the next several decades.

There's a nice finale to Chaplin's life in which he returns to the 1972 Academy Awards to receive a special award and discovers that even though Hollywood has changed greatly it never forgot him. One of the last of the clips to be shown is a kid being taken away from his father in which Chaplin is arguably demonstrating the fantasy of what he wished for when he was a child. That was a nice wraparound to one of the matters which haunted Chaplin's past . . . being an orphan and abandoned by his parents. I believe the actual picture was the 1921 ""The Kid"".

Downey's acting got him a nomination for Best Actor by the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards but BAFTA gave him the actual award for Best Actor. The film was nominated by those three for other awards (too many to list, really). Note that one of Chaplin's daughters, Geraldine Chaplin, played the role of Charlie Chaplin's ""going insane"" mother in the movie.

A number of other actors and actresses played various roles, including Dan Akroyd (Hollywood producer Mack Sennett), Moira Kelly (two roles: Chaplin's first serious love interest and then his final wife), Diane Lane (Chaplin's third wife and actress, Paulette Goddard), Milla Jovovich (another actress wife to Chaplin), Anthony Hopkins (as Chaplin's later editor for his autobiography), Penelope Ann Miller (Hollywood actress), Marisa Tomei (another Hollywood actress), Kevin Kline (as Chaplin's friend, Dougla Fairbanks, not to be confused with Douglas Fairbanks Jr, his son), James Woods and David Duchovny (Chaplin's cameraman). For director fans Richard Attenborough directed this piece.

73222,5,0784011680,"First off a warning: For all those people thinking this should be funny because Charlie Chaplin was funny ... it isn't.
This movie is a masterpiece. It explores the life of Charlie Chaplin with all the complexities that life has to offer.
This film is a beautiful work of art. Quality that rivals Hollywoods Golden Age that we rarely get to see. Centered around an actual storyline rather than relying on special effects, or over-payed ""A-List"" movie stars. Each actor/actress was carefully chosen. Great depth and detail went into this film. Included in the writing credits is Charlie Chaplin himself from his book (IMDB), so that adds an additional credibility to the content of the film.
Another aspect that brings life to this story is the amazing Geraldine Chaplin, Charlies daughter, who had the wonderful job of portraying her grandmother, Hannah Chaplin.
Robert Downey Jr pours his soul into bringing this character to life. This is by far the finest performance of his career, of which he should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor, but lost out to Clint Eastwood for Unforgiven (of all films).
If Robert's and Geraldine's uncanny performances and Sir Richard Attenborough's brilliant directorial vison isn't enough; the film sports an all-star cast including:
Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks,Sir Anthony Hopkins, Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane, Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann  Miller, Kevin Dunn (as J. Edgar Hoover),Dan Aykroyd, Nancy Travis and Moira Kelly.

73223,4,0784011680,"Charlie Chaplin is played by Robert Downey, Jr., but also by Chaplin himself in old films, both his own movies and various studio publicity and news items. Another odd little twist is that Geraldine Chaplin plays her own grandmother, Charlie's mother. The only truly fictional character is played by Anthony Hopkins, an editor on the writing of Chaplin's biography, or perhaps his literary agent, or something. In any case, it gives him the excuse to ask the elderly Chaplin questions about his early years and provide narration for the story.

Dan Aykroyd is just right playing Mack Sennett, the director/producer who gave Chaplin his start in films. Kevin Kline plays Douglas Fairbanks and Maria Pitillo plays Mary Pickford, two of Chaplin's closest friends. For the villain of the piece, Kevin Dunn plays J. Edgar Hoover.

Chaplain was married four or five times -- I rather lost track -- and at one point was sued for child support for a child that was not his because the State of California would not admit blood test evidence in court. Not DNA, mind you, but just blood type. Chaplin and the baby were tested, but the judge suppressed the evidence that would have exonerated him from responsibility. He paid child support until the girl turned 18.

The last marriage, to Oona O'Neill (Moira Kelly), was the only one that lasted, and that for more than 20 years. In fact, I think it was more than 30 years, because the setting of when he wrote his autobiography was at least ten years before he died. Oona was only 18, Chaplin was already middle aged, when they married. It seems she may have been the only wife who actually loved him, rather than his money and his fame.

A lot of the political material in the film was things I had not known, including the fact that he was criticized for making ""The Great Dictator"" before the US got into the war, and only praised for it once we were in it. Another is that Hoover eventually had him barred from returning to the states after he'd spent some time in London, arguing that he was a communist. It became quite clear that Chaplin was by no means a communist, with lower case or capital letter, but rather a humanist. Hoover, never one of the great intellectual lights of the nation, was unable to tell the difference, and cited the fact that Chaplin had never renounced his British citizenship and applied for American citizenship.

I wonder if the person don't know the difference between both medias, but the person surely knows that a Blu Ray is most often more expensive than a DVD is, especially when it is a recent release, so, at least is weird, wouldn't you say? You order a BLU RAY, you pay the price of a BLU RAY, and yet, you get a DVD? Come on? Since this has happened to me, it could well happen to anybody else, so, you'd better watch out, buy at your own risk, as for me, it has been an awful buying experience, so I'd never buy again from, nor will I reccomend this person to anybody else, someone who sends you a dvd when you order and pay for a blu ray can't be serious, and it's not worth to be on AMAZON team as well.

73250,4,0784011680,"Chaplin manages to be an effective Bio pic of one of Hollywood's most famous Silent Film stars Charlie Chaplin (Robert Downey Jr.) despite simply jumping from one moment in his life to next. For instance when Charlie says he's going to be a director, it just jumps to him saying that after that he directed over 100 movies in one year. The film is long, yet it feels rushed. Downey Jr's performance is inspired and possibly his best performance, but the film itself doesn't feel too inspired.

  I mean we're supposed to believe that a woman that is only in 2 scenes was his lost love. This is how the film tries to make us believe that. Chaplin is helping a performer with her dress and sees a young actress changing, she's mad he's there, but lets him hold a mirror for her as she puts on lip-stick. Then suddenly the film jumps to them on a date and him asking her to marry him. Did I miss something ? When did he even ask her out and when did she even act like she liked him before that ? Then the film jumps to him getting invited to act in Hollywood and the film doesn't even bother showing him upset that he had to leave her or even show them say goodbye to each other.

  The film introduces Kevin Kline as Chaplin's best friend just as lazy. He simply is just shown playing tennis with Chaplin and I don't think we're even shown how these 2 met. Still, Downey Jr. and Kevin Kline work excellent together. It's the case where Chaplin works due to the actors pulling through better than the script. The film manges to be moving and effective but mostly due to performances by actors like Downey Jr. and Kevin Kline.

  The way Chaplin is unfairly treated like a communist by the President (Kevin Dunn) and a lawyer (James Woods) is well done though. Other than that the movie just jumps from Chaplin being with one woman to the next. It's how he was mis-treated that makes us feel for the guy. Chaplin says in public that he won't shake the hand of a Nazi, yet his film The Great Dictator where he dresses up like Hitler backfires in his face and finally gives the President a good reason to call him a communist.",1266278400,,2120,4.319899244332493

73253,5,0784011680,"Chaplin was a great Artist, and a pioneer of film, arguably the great art form of the 20th Century. American Poet Hart Crane put it this way, in his poem, Chaplinesque:

We make our meek adjustments,
Contented with such random consolations
As the wind deposits
In slithered and too ample pockets.

For we can still love the world, who find
A famished kitten on the step, and know
Recesses for it from the fury of the street,
Or warm torn elbow coverts.

We will sidestep, and to the final smirk
Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb
That slowly chafes its puckered index toward us,
Facing the dull squint with what innocence
And what surprise!

And what surprise it was for Hart when after answering a knock on his door he saw a friend with the great comedian himself in tow. The three spent many whimsical hours together, I'm sure. I will continue the poem at this review's conclusion. While I never had the privilege of meeting Mr. Chaplin, I almost feel like I have, after seeing Richard Attenborough's film, Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr. gave an excellent performance, recreating the great comedy and character of The Little Tramp, and also providing insight into the man behind the myth.

I remember seeing Chaplin finally honored by the Academy after living in exile for so many years. There was a confused, frightened look in his eyes, as if he was afraid that he was about to be ambushed by his old nemesis, J. Edgar Hoover. He looked, as Hart Crane said in another poem, ""confused among the chrysanthemums."" There was also something else, the sense that his contribution was appreciated after all. He was finally getting validation. Robert Downey Jr. really captured that bittersweet moment, and all the other moments in Chaplin's life.

Chaplin's case and the memorable ""Oscar Moment"" reminded me of two other events at the Oscars. One was when Roman Polanski, also in exile, won Best Director for The Pianist. Compare and contrast Chaplin's case with Roman Polanski. Discuss it amongst yourselves, as I have no real point to make--only that it was oddly similar, and oddly different. Then when Elia Kazan won a Lifetime Achievement award, some people refused to stand up for his standing ovation. Nick Nolte sat there looking as grim as a Malibu mug shot. Chris Rock later commented on the incongruity between the reaction for Polanski and the one for Kazan, who had named names to HUAC. How rude of Rock, and no wonder he wasn't asked back to host, but he did have a point.

Chaplin, the film, makes a very good case that J. Edgar Hoover persecuted Chaplin, the man. There is a scene where Charlie is shown (wittily but unwittingly) planting the seeds of rancor:

--------------------------
J. Edgar Hoover: I have to wonder if you people realize the level of responsibility you carry. From my way of thinking, Motion Pictures are potentially the most influential form of communication ever invented. And there's no control over it. Your message reaches everyone, everywhere.
Mary Pickford: Message?
J. Edgar Hoover: Of course, Mr. Chaplin here reaches millions who only have to see; and when they see a mockery being made of our immigration services, I call that a message.
Charlie Chaplin: Yes, well, uh, as you've already said Mr. Hoover, Motion Pictures are for the people; most of the people work for a living, and they don't make much money doing it; gives them pleasure to see an official from the upper classes getting a kick up the backside. Always has, and it always will; and if that can change things, so much the better.
[in a better pronounced, less cockney voice]
Charlie Chaplin: Bet-ter.
=====================================

What was it that Frank Zappa said about the reason Lenny Bruce died? And what was it Richard Nixon said to H.R. Haldeman when he heard that J. Edgar Hoover had died? Funny (again not funny ha ha) that Anthony Hopkins and James Woods, both in this film, played Nixon and Haldeman, respectively, in Oliver Stone's Nixon. And what were the final two stanzas of Hart Crane's poem, Chaplinesque? Why, look down below:

And yet these fine collapses are not lies
More than the pirouettes of any pliant cane;
Our obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise.
We can evade you, and all else but the heart:
What blame to us if the heart live on.

The game enforces smirks; but we have seen
The moon in lonely alleys make
A grail of laughter of an empty ash can,
And through all sound of gaiety and quest
Have heard a kitten in the wilderness.

Geraldine Chaplin played her own grandmother, Charlie Chaplin's mother, Hannah, who was plagued by madness. She was excellent, but what would you expect? It's in her blood. Her presence gave the whole project the Chaplin Stamp of Approval.

John Thaw was familiar to me as Inspector Morse, the title character from the British detective program. He played impresario Fred Karno, who gave Chaplin his first job, but also boorishly sabotaged his budding romance with Hetty Kelly. Akroyd was good as Mack Sennett, the man who gave Chaplin his big break in the film industry. James Woods was the 'persecuting attorney' who tried Chaplin in a bogus paternity suit. Anthony Hopkins was playing an editor, and had a utilitarian role to move the exposition along, when Chaplin was being vague about certain aspects of his personal life. A framing device. Not an actual person, a composite character.

Kevin Kline was good as Douglas Fairbanks, doing some impressive stunts, but I can see him as Cole Porter in De-Lovely, or Guy Noir in A Prairie Home Companion, but I don't see him as Douglas Fairbanks. Funny (not funny ha ha, but funny weird/strange) that in the bonus material of Prairie Home Companion his fellow thespians, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, describe him as ""our generation's Chaplin."" Though he played The Pirate King in a film of Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance, that still doesn't qualify him to play Fairbanks. A minor quibble. He did a good job, but he didn't melt into his character like Robert Downey Jr.

Moira Kelly played a dual role: both Hetty Kelly, young Charlie's first crush, and Oona O'Neill Chaplin, his last wife. I guess that was supposed to show that he was searching for that lost love of his youth. Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann Miller, and Milla Jovovich played other women in Chaplin's life.

Bottom line is Chaplin was a very good film, successful as a biopic, and also as an historical chronicle showing the role of film and comedy in our country's history, and the intersection of politics and comedy. The Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, and Supporting Cast were all top notch. Great performance by Downey, who is a master of comedy and drama, and also not a stranger to controversy in his own life. He was perfect for this role. He could relate.

73255,4,0784011680,"A lot can be said as to how authentic the passages in the movie were but it takes nothing away from the excellent acting and the important recollection of early movie history. For many later generations (my own included) Chaplin has stood as a mere comedian, Buster Keatons 'successor' who bridged the gap into the talking movies etc. There was so much more to the man not the least his increasing political statements that in the end led to him being expelled from the US during the Communist witch hunt haydays......

I certainly learned a lot from this movie and while being mesmorized by particularly Robert Downey Jr's performance I gained an appetite for learning more about this remarkable little English man, all the while I was thoroughly entertained.

Second while somewhat based on Chaplin's autobiography , the film uses flashback sequences and the device of Chaplin dictating his book to a fictional editor/ghostwriter played by Anthony Hopkins to great effect.

The clips from the original films are weaved into the story pretty seamlessly. Finally Chaplin's story is the story of Hollywood and the film industry. The scenes of the early days of Hollywood and and the glow of Los Angeles when it was a small town are fascinating to watch.

This movie opens your eyes to the man behind the comedy, while you still get to see Robert Downey Jr. play the comedian as we know him, and love him.

He has proven, up to the present, that he is one of America's foremost actors, regardless of the off the screen craziness that dragged him down for so long.  The film is very interesting to watch, but it's Downey with his seemingly bottomless bag of talent that lulls the viewer into the false sense of watching a film WITH Chaplin, rather than about him.  The gods of comedy and tragedy have given Mr. Downey a plethora of gifts and it feels good to sit and watch him use these gifts so brilliantly.

73261,5,0784011680,"Those of you who may be a fan of Robert Downey, Jr. from Iron Man and/or Tropic Thunder should see him in his greatest role as Charlie Chaplin.  Chaplin is a wonderfully nuanced portrayal of one of the true geniuses of cinema with an all-star cast which included Anthony Hopkins, Dan Aykroyd, Diane Lane, James Woods, Geraldine Chaplin (playing her actual grandmother), Marisa Tomei, a very young David Duchovny, and Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  But since he is at the center of essentially every frame, the movie's success rides on Downey's performance of perhaps the greatest movie icon ever, and Downey succeeds brilliantly.  Whether emulating Chaplin's physical pratfalls or showing his underlying passion and commitment to his art, to his compassion for humanity, to the real life pathos of his love life, Downey's performance is one for the ages.  The movie's memorable ending shows Chaplin's triumphant return to America in 1972 and being awarded an honorary Academy Award while showing Peter Bogdanovich's homage to the real Chaplin.",1234656000,,1050,5.195266272189349
73262,5,0784011680,"Wow, this is one of the finest acting jobs I have seen as Robert Downey Jr. portrays the famous Charlie Chaplin. His performance includes some of Chaplin's famous slapstick moves and Downey is tremendous at executing them.

To the film's credit ,it does show both the good and bad sides to this famous man. But it's definitely biased. Just check out how they portray J. Edgar Hoover, a man Hollywood loves to hate (along with any Conservative or Republican). Hoover is pictured as mean-spirited and nasty throughout, and is even blasted in the ending credits! (His first speech at a dinner table, intended to show him in a negative actually shows him to be prophetic whether Tinseltown ever admits it or not.)

Regarding Chaplin, if the film was the truth (that's always a big ""if""), then it WAS a real miscarriage of justice to kick him out of the country for having a baby he didn't produce. Nevertheless, most of the film centers around his career and his wives, most of whom were very pretty with great figures.....but too young, most of them being teenagers!

Also shown nicely in the film are Chaplin's talent, his obsession with work, his great friendship with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Kevin Kline), the great films he produced and the sympathy he had with the American poor. On the other side, in addition to his pedophile instincts, one wonders why Chaplin never became an American citizen? They certainly did not help his cause.

The movie sports a big-name cast, with Kline probably providing the most likable role next to Downey. The women were very interesting: from Geraldine Chaplin playing Charlie's insane, pathetically-sad mother to beauties like Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane and Moria Kelly, the latter playing Chaplin's final and devoted wife ""Oona.""

Also in here are some big names: Anthony Hopkins, Dan Ackroyd, Penelope Ann Miller, Marissa Tomei, James Woods, Nancy Travis and Paul Rhys. They all help make this a memorable biography. It's beautifully filmed with a number of stunning scenes and also has a classy soundtrack. I'd like to see this on Blu-Ray!  The story's ending is manipulative, but it works. It always brings a tear to my eye.

I liked what they did at the end with the small biographies of all the leading characters and visually showing who played each one. I wish all films did that.",1233619200,,2324,4.868354430379747
73263,4,0784011680,"Chaplin tugs at your heartstrings and keeps you interested every step of the way. The acting is superlative and Robert Downey, Jr. in particular does a tour-de-force performance as Charles Chaplin. We really get to see the man Chaplin as a human being, both successful and sometimes victimized as he works in Hollywood; and the cinematography is excellent.

The film begins with Robert Downey, Jr. all made up as The Little Tramp--but it quickly breaks away to Chaplin as an old man giving a bit more information about his life story as the editor of his autobiography (a partially fictionalized character George Hayden played by Anthony Hopkins) asks Chaplin questions. Thus we see Chaplin's story primarily in flashbacks.

Chaplin tells the story of how he became a star in vaudeville not long after he got his first break; and he could always make the audiences laugh. But already not everything has gone well for Charlie--although he has his older brother Sydney for support, their mother Hannah (Geraldine Chaplin) is in an asylum for insane persons and his father is very absent. Charles also relates to the editor of his autobiography how he rose to fame at Mack Sennett (Dan Aykroyd) studios and how within just a couple of years was directing his own films making more than Sennett ever did. We also see Charlie's attempts at love--his first crush never married him and it took him a forth try at marriage to a lady named Oona (Moira Kelly, who also plays Charlie's first crush Hetty Kelly) to make a true love last. Along the way we get good performances by Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks and Marisa Tomei as a fearsome Mabel Normand who fell into obscurity after a scandal broke loose involving her.

Unfortunately, the movie takes liberties with the telling of Chaplin's real life. In the movie Charlie barely mentions anything about his father and Chaplin indicates that his father was rather absent when prompted to talk about him from his editor. In real life, Chaplin's father took care of Charlie and Sydney for about four years when their mother could not do so. In addition, the creation of The Little Tramp character was done gradually over a couple of months perhaps; but in the movie it happened spontaneously with Chaplin's first flick at Mack Sennett's studios. The movie makes no mention of the eight children he had with Oona; and although he never lived an especially fancy lifestyle in later life, the movie depicts his home in Switzerland as being rather opulent.

The DVD has a few extras; I liked the interview with director Richard Attenborough the best.

Overall, Chaplin is a great film; but the inaccuracies take away one and one-half stars to make this a three and one-half star review. There are no references to the jumps Chaplin made between Sennett to Essanay Studios, Mutual and First National Studios. Ouch! It's a great tear-jerker at times, especially at the end, but if you're looking for real life in its purest form Chaplin is something more of a fanciful biopic than an accurate one.",1233014400,2,3033,4.847490347490347

73267,5,0784011680,"In the hands of director Richard Attenborough, Charlie Chaplin's life story becomes a sweeping and touching drama.  Robert Downey, Jr. gives an unforgettable performance as Chaplin, who rose from the slums of London to become Hollywood's favorite silent movie character, the Tramp.  Along the way, Charlie had to deal with his mother's insanity, his love affairs, marriages, and a paternity scandal, all involving much younger women, and investigation by none other than J. Edgar Hoover.

This very entertaining story vividly recreates the beginnings of the movie industry.  The sets and costumes are magnificent, as is the John Barry soundtrack, which features Chaplin's own song, ""Smile.""  Downey gives the performance of a lifetime playing a controversial but ultimately very likeable hero over a span of sixty years.  He oozes charisma.

As far as special features go for this one, there's about 3 new featurettes that are less than 10 minutes long as well as some home movie footage of Charlie Chaplin and of course a trailer.

Unfortunately there are no deleted scenes. I suspect that this release has come out only due to Robert Downey Jr's rise in popularity again.

73270,5,0784011680,"If you're anything like me, the almost semi-annual relapse and recovery of Robert Downey Jr. has been an interesting periodic feature of the morning news. After a while one begins to question why does Hollywood put up with him when there is no shortage of talented actors desperately trying to make it in Hollywood? Why would producers and studios, who are so financially dependent on their productions going off without a hitch, take yet another chance on Robert Downey, Jr? Then I saw Chaplin, and I understood.

The intensity and power of the Robert Downey's performance in this film is the stuff of Oscars and true movie legend! It's both a beautiful performance and a beautiful film!

Somehow Sir Richard Attenborough got out of Downey the kind of performance that can sustain a career, and a legend. But Sir Richard's mastery didn't stop there. He got spectacular performance out of everyone, including a young, pre-X-Files David Duchovny. (I know I misspelled that. But you know who I mean.)

In summation, Robert Downey's performance is every bit the equal of James Dean's in Giant, East of Eden or Rebel without a Cause, and maybe that's what we should keep in mind. For unlike Dean, another self-destructive personality, Robert Downey has not driven off the cliff yet, and hopefully he never will.",1222560000,6,1307,4.931818181818182
73271,4,0784011680,"'Chaplin' is a difficult film to pull off for at least two reasons, first... who could possibly portray Charlie Chaplin and his genius?... and how do you fit this guy's entire story into one film?  Chaplin had one heck of a complicated, long life with many severe ups and downs! Fortunately for us, they got some of these important factors right. The film runs well over two hours, but I never felt truly satisfied with the detail of many scenes. The biggest flaw is that some areas of his life are whisked by so fast it's hard to grasp everything.

Robert Downey Jr. should get a lot of credit as without his believable portrayal of this man, the movie could never work at all. It's a very interesting movie with great performances, but it's not a great movie. The DVD has a very good transfer, but lacks in any worthy extras.",1221350400,7,827,4.470198675496689

73274,5,0784011680,"It is probably not the best film ever made about Charlie Chaplin, and I even think it is far behind Charlie Chaplin's own autobiography on which it is supposed to be based. But it makes a couple of points rather well. First, show business is business first of all. Brutal, expeditious, pitiless, cruel, full of hate and with hardly any love, except the illusion of a companionship they call love in Hollywood. But we know that. And even the FBI or McCarthy could not touch that: business money is  business money and cannot be spoiled even if the owner is a communist or at least is accused of being one. Second, McCarthyism was an ugly adventure in the USA, but it is shown as having run in the texture of the country from the very start and particularly after the Russian revolution. The best part about it is that it made American politicians suspicious of anything that was not lauding the USA as THE ONLY country of freedom (except of course for those that have been declared unwanted characters, or anything that could in anyway seem to be supporting the poor, the working class, the underlings of this egotistic world. The portrait of Edgar Hoover is that of a fanatic, a fundamentalist, and yet nothing but an apparatchik that never leaves his pacifying desk and the comfortable warmth of his office. Third, this film shows so well through Chaplin's own life how the world changed and how no politician can stop it. A politician can make some people suffer, at times a lot when he has the means to go out and wage war, but even so he will not be able to change history, to stop history, to even strand or wreck history. Hitler is the best case at hand. The amount of suffering he caused is enormous and yet did he stop history, did he block it into some eternal barbaric dictatorship? Of course not. And Charlie Chaplin's wisecrack about not having the honor of being a Jew is the best answer anyone could do to any attempt at hijacking history: I don't have the honor of being your victim, and if I were your victim I would be honored to be one of them, to have their company. British wit and humor at the same time as British caustic sarcasm. Beautiful!

73275,5,0784011680,"This is far from a perfect movie, but it's still a very good movie and interesting for a number of reasons.

On the down side, I think it probably presents a very biased view of Chaplin, at the expenses of many of his contemporaries (Mabel Normand in particular).  It would have been a much better movie had it been less eager to excuse the less appealing aspects of Chaplin's personality.

On the up side, Robert Downey, Jr., does a remarkable job of imitating Chaplin's physical comedy, and it's a treat to get a look at the very early days of the movies.  I recommend this (and rate it well) despite its considerable flaws, and I wish more biographies (even fictionalized biographies) were made of early film stars.",1213660800,2,718,4.6299212598425195

The film focuses on Chaplin's (played by Robert Downey Jr.) rise and fall in American film, culiminating in his exile from the United States after Hoover's relentless attempts to prove him a communist threat finally succeeded. Downey Jr. is really quite good as Chaplin, especially in the evolution of his English accent. (Although as the elderly Chaplin, he is a bit creepy). Anyone who is a tried and true fan of Chaplin, however, will find many details to criticize: his facial expressions aren't quite right, his physical movements don't quite capture the grace of Chaplin's.

73278,5,0784011680,"`Chaplin' has a lot going for it.  It's a biopic and that always rests well with me.  The subject of that said biopic is a man who was famous for his ability to entertain.  The star cast in that important role of lead delivers a performance so electrifying there's no wonder why he received the Oscar nomination.  The rest of the cast is so star studded you're drawn to the prospect of what you'll see, even if every apart from the star is limited in their screen time.  It's faithfully directed by a man who adored and respected his subject.  But, without a script, without a story none of this really matters.  So, what makes `Chaplin' a film worth every second is the fact that it tells quite a story.

The life of Charlie Chaplin was one filled with rises and falls.  He started off struggling but then rose almost immediately before falling back down only to be lifted up once again.  It's a rollercoaster of a way to live, but it makes for one interesting journey for the audience.  Charlie Chaplin started his life dirt poor.  What made things worse was the fact that his mother, for her own good, was admitted to an asylum while Charlie was still quite young.  His mothers theatrical aspirations did have an impact on Charlie though, a good one, for he soon made a name for himself as a comedian of the stage.  It wasn't until he moved to the states to pursue film roles though that he became the face behind silent film.

`Chaplin' would be little more than a good story without the brilliant performance given by Robert Downey Jr., a performance that captures the essence that was Charlie Chaplin and exposes this man to the full.  Downey Jr. understands Chaplin and brings so much light and charisma to this role, a role that defined him as a star and not just a Hollywood bad-boy.  I only wish that Robert Downey Jr. could receive more roles of this nature for he really sinks his teeth into this performance and drags out something everyone can admire and respect.  He captured the emotional depth of this man while embellishing the signature charm and comedic grace of the legend himself.  A far cry from a mere mimic, Downey Jr. slipped away inside this man and recreated him from the ground up.

Sadly, this was released the same year as `Malcolm X' so I can't truthfully say that Robert Downey Jr. was robbed of the Oscar.  In fact Denzel Washington was robbed of the Oscar, but that's for another review.

The film exposes the good as well as the bad times in this mans life, from his womanizing days, his many marriages and his confrontations with J. Edgar Hoover, a volatile relationship that caused much heartache in Chaplin's life.  It never rushes things but takes it time to flesh out this man and create a feeling of truly knowing him inside and out.  Apparently the original cut of the film was nearly four hours long, and while that seems like a long time I'd be interested in seeing the film in its entirety for I'm sure there is so much more of this mans life that would be intriguing to discover.  Still, with all the cuts made to the film it never appears condensed or lacking.

The film sports a slew of supporting performances, all of which are brilliantly crafted by the cast.  Geraldine Chaplin plays her own grandmother Hannah effortlessly with such commanding presence and Paul Rhys is able to play second fiddle to the star without giving up is star power entirely.  The beautiful actresses who played the women in Charlie's life all do splendid jobs, Diane Lane in particular is stunning and makes the most lasting impression.  Moira Kelly is wonderful as Chaplin's loving wife Oona, but she lacks the screen presence that Lane brings to her performance.  Milla Jovovich is stunning as Charlie's first wife Mildred and Dan Aykroyd is in top form as Mack Sennett and delivers an exciting and well rounded comedic performance.  The cast is so extensive it's really hard to single out everyone, but one performer that needs to be mentioned is Kevin Kline who just delivers effortlessly as Charlie's good friend Douglas Fairbanks.  He's charming and graceful and so in tune with her character it's an utter joy to watch.

`Chaplin' delivers everything you could ask for in a biopic.  It's interesting, informative, entertaining and commanding, giving us reasons to laud, admire and sympathize with a man who brought so much joy to so many people.",1195171200,,4381,4.646753246753247

73291,5,0784011680,"""Chaplin"" starring Robert Downey, Jr. as the Little Tramp from the silent film era does something truly remarkable.  It tells the story of Charlie Chaplin, flaws and all, and still makes you admire and respect the man.

The film, covering a period of roughly 70-80 years, could easily have become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the history, the characters, the events, but it flows so smoothly that never once did I glance at the clock.

Downey turns in the performance of a lifetime.  Nothing against Al Pacino, who won the Academy Award that year for ""Scent of a Woman"", but Downey was clearly shortchanged in nothing short of highway robbery in his loss of the big award.

His Chaplin is thoughtful, inspiring, flawed, creative, torn, troubled and a genius, all at the same time.  The real Chaplin's obvious gift for pantomine and entertaining is evident in this film, as well as his hardscrabble upbringing and his obvious liking of very young women as his paramours. (His last marriage, to the teenage Oona O'Neill, is shown as a real and affectionate marriage from both sides, and not the leering older man going after the young girl, as was the vast opinion at the time).

The film is chock full of talent, from Kevin Kline, Marisa Tomei, Moira Kelly, Penelope Ann Miller, Diane Lane, Anthony Hopkins, James Woods . . .a real ""who's who"" of the Hollywood community.  And yet, the film truly belongs to Downey.

The sets and scenery are beautiful and I loved seeing how Hollywood must have been back in the 1910s and 1920s.

If you are a Chaplin aficionado, you will embrace and enjoy this look at his remarkable life - - even if you aren't a Chaplin fan, you can learn why Chaplin was such a revered man in Hollywood, and certainly appreciate Downey's acting chops.  This film is proof of why Hollywood keeps letting this particular bad boy come back home.

See this movie to pay respects to Chaplin, to appreciate the always great Anthony Hopkins (in a small role) and the many other stellar actors in this film, but most of all, see it to awe over Robert Downey, Jr.'s impressive and poignant turn as one of the Hollywood Greats.

73293,5,0784011680,"It must be enormously difficult to produce a worthy biographical movie, the subject matter can be less clourful than the ""Famous"" persona suggests. Critical scrutiny of the work is always going to be harsh and purist, particularly from family and the fan base. Chaplin is a more rounded and colourful subject than most but that notion in itself would not make the project easy.

Attenborough does a sterling job given that the story has to span several decades of enormous change, incorporate a massive cast and demonstrate Chaplin's artistic importance as well as the complexities of his personal life.

Downey Jr is an outstanding star and gives Chaplin a a fuller and more human character and face which is at once tragic, loving, driven,even sexy. His British accent is impeccable, I actually for got he is American very early on which is praise indeed from a native Brit, his Englishness was far better than Rees's Americanisation (the actor who plays Sydney Chaplin and is actually British, he is great in the role nonetheless).

Downey Jr also manages to portray a sense of iron hard strength and lost and lonely vulnerability that were the essential components of Chaplin's personality. Downey Jr also works hard to get a sense of Chaplin's balletic, choreographed comedy. Essential viewing, Downey Jr was most definitely robbed of the Oscar for this role, he did however win the BAFTA for it (British Academy Film and Television Award).",1132531200,3,1445,5.0125
73294,5,0784011680,"We live in a time when actors have their faces, butts, chests, and legs, digitally improved for the movies.  Chaplin had none of those tools and was on the ground floor of the movie industry.  This picture shows the genious Chaplin on the cutting edge.  Some actors can barely say their lines today, while Chaplin directed, acted, did choreography, and even wrote and sometimes played the music for his movies.  The greatest hollywood talent of all time; it's not close.

The movie of course spent more time talking about his private life which also was very interesting for the public.  It talked about his love for young women and his court battle with the famous paternity case.  At that time even with a blood test, the court wrongly said that Chaplin was the father of a child from a deranged ex when he was not.  He was forced to pay child support.  It was a landmark case.

Robert Downey Jr. was amazing and stayed dedicated to Chaplin while his family watched on during filming.  It showed the best and worst of him.  Like the movie ""Hoffa"", a fictitional character; which wasn't needed; was used during the film and it slightly clouded up the story.  It also talked about his relationship with J. Edgar hoover and the night they became enemies.  Chaplin was also ahead of his time hating the Nazi's when in the 30's many Americans admired them.

From his terrible childhood as a poor English kid with a loving brother and a mother who was losing her mind, to the great break in the ""flickers"".  I watch it all of the time and am now a Chaplin fan.  I've never had anyone that I've recommended it to not like it.",1122681600,3,1620,4.512027491408935
73295,3,0784011680,"Yes, this is without a doubt, the best biographic film made of Chaplin...also just about the only one. However, if you are looking to learn more about the man and his work, choose a well done documentary instead. While this film was mildly entertaining, it failed to capture the magic of Charlie and his character, the Tramp. The movie seems to skip through his life at lightening speed, touching only momentarily some of the greatest things that Chaplin is legend for. Most of the film was spent on Chaplin's personal life off camera and even that was only somwehat accurate. Many of the bits played by Chaplin are out of context and things hapen on screen which never happened in Charlie's real life. For instance, Chaplin supposedly sees his first ""flicker"" in Montana and it is at that time he supposedly gets a telegram from Mack Sennett about signing with Keystone to be in the ""flickers."" While this may add drama, this never happened. To be honest, the way Chaplin describes it in his autobiography is more dramatic than the way it was depicted in this film. As is most of the material.

The thing which is perhaps most disturbing is the appearance of the characters. If you're a true Chaplin fan, you'll know that Robert Downey Jr. is not able to pull of The Little Fellow all that well - in fact there are probably only a handful of actors that could. Downey is much more built, his head is too small in proportion to his body, and his face doesn't show the more gentle demeanor that Chaplin had. His voice was way too different was well. Of course, Chaplin was a silent actor, but he did make a series of sound films and unfortunately, Downey's voice sounded nothing like Chaplin, even the British accent. However, there are a few instances in which Downey did almost make me believe that it was Chaplin himself that I was watching.

The supporting actors weren't all that impressive either. Sydney Chaplin looked nothing like his real life counterpart, Chaplin's mother looked like a completely different person.

Chaplin's early wives are barely mentioned at all. If you haven't read his autobiography or knew about them in advance, you probably wouldn't know who they were at all. Lita Grey is hardly seen while in real life, she constituted one of the most difficult and dramatic parts of Chaplin's entire life, not to mention she gave him two children.

This film can satifsy a craving for observing the personal side of Chaplin, but I'd rather snuggle up with a biography on him written by his friends and family. They reveal what really happened and a side of Charlie that you won't see anywhere else - even in the movies. I recommend ""My Father, Charlie Chaplin"", written by Charlie Jr.; ""My Life With Chaplin"", written by Lita Grey Chaplin; ""The Charlie Chaplin Interviews""; and of course Chaplin's own books, ""My Autobiography,"" ""Charlie Chaplin's Own Story,"" ""My Life in Pictures.""",1118880000,3,2903,4.7654075546719685

73298,3,0784011680,"Directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, director of Gandhi, this is the story of Sir Charles Chaplin. The comic genius who showed the world what comedy was and introduced American society into the film era. This film, simply put, was amazing. I was hesitant at first to see how well Robert Downy, Jr would do as one of the most influential men in movie history...and he was on target. He showed the brilliance of Chaplin, and also showed a bit of his dark side. The side that not many knew about...his underage womanizing, his constant pursuit of perfection over anything else in the world, and also as the humanitarian.

Chaplin did more for film then any other actor during his time, and it showed. Although my biggest gripe about this film would be the director, the actors themselves took me away from my seat an into the life of Charlie Chaplin. This film stared Dan Ankroyd, Anthony Hopkins, Moria Kelly, Penelope Ann Miller, Marisa Tomei, James Woods, Diane Lane, Nancy Travis, Kevin Kline, and even a favorite of mine...Milla Jovovich.  The all star cast pushed this movie to excellence.  This film could have been one of the best autobiographical pieces ever made, had it not been for the director.  Now, don't get me wrong...he does good work...just this one was not his ""cup of tea"".  I went into this film expecting a darker ending...a darker story...and a darker character.  We all knew how funny he was, but how dark was his humor...when I went back and looked at some of his old silent films (before the ""talkies"") I was amazed by how many of them portray his life...the darker aspects of his life.  There are many scenes about his mother and how she was put into an asylum by Chaplin himself.  Hopkins makes the comment, ""Your grandmother was certified insane, and your mother was certified insane...where did you get your humor?"" That line made me think...I would have liked to see the trauma that was impacted him as a child.

Douglas Fairbanks (played wonderfully by Kevin Kline) said to him, ""You know you look like him, Hitler...with the mustache. I think he stole your bit."" and Chaplin just smiles....was there something there that we didn't know about...was Chaplin a communist although his brother was a Jew.  These were confusing, and the director did not cover these grounds.

Downey in several of the scenes tells Hopkins (the book reviewer) that he doesn't want to talk about it...and they don't .... I wanted them to go deeper into his psyche and see where all of it came from.  Most of these points were just passing glance...which irritated me. Watch the ending, the director tries to wrap up Chaplin's life at the Academy Awards, and that was when it hit me about how much darker I wanted this to be...I don't know, I guess I am the generation of JFK and Nixon or Oliver Stone at his best...but I needed darker.

I know it was there.....I just know it!!!!

What sinks the film is the screenplay, Downey's one-dimentional depiction of Chaplin, and a director too clueless to notice what these were doing to his picture. According to his leading ladies, Chaplin was only depressed and brooding when he was creatively blocked. In Chaplin he is depicted as always depressed. There isn't one montage to show him as the directorial dirvige he was described as being by those who knew him. Instead of directing Downey out of this emotional rut, he plods along through Chaplin's life like a man walking from fencepost to fencepost.

73302,5,0784011680,"If you're anything like me, the almost semi-annual relapse and recovery of Robert Downey Jr. has been an interesting periodic feature of the morning news. After a while one begins to question why does Hollywood put up with him when there is no shortage of talented actors desperately trying to make it in Hollywood? Why would producers and studios, who are so financially dependent on their productions going off without a hitch, take yet another chance on Robert Downey, Jr? Then I saw Chaplin, and I understood.
The intensity and power of the Robert Downey's performance in this film is the stuff of Oscars and true movie legend! It's both a beautiful performance and a beautiful film!
Somehow Sir Richard Attenborough got out of Downey the kind of performance that can sustain a career, and a legend. But Sir Richard's mastery didn't stop there. He got spectacular performance out of everyone, including a young, pre-X-Files David Duchovny. (I know I misspelled that. But you know who I mean.)
In summation, Robert Downey's performance is every bit the equal of James Dean's in Giant, East of Eden or Rebel without a Cause, and maybe that's what we should keep in mind. For unlike Dean, another self-destructive personality, Robert Downey has not driven off the cliff yet, and hopefully he never will.",1088899200,119,1304,4.931818181818182

73304,5,0784011680,"Charles Chaplin was one of the pioneers in film who brought us classics such as The Kid (1921), Gold Rush (1925), Modern Times (1936), and Great Dictator (1940).  His many successes are still to this day considered masterpieces which he created, acted, directed, and edited.  He had a brilliant eye for what the human mind was observing and he could make comedy out of almost anything.  However, despite Chaplin's great sense of humor the recurrent theme in his life seems to be surrounded by sadness and loss where his escape was to help others feel a sense of joy.  Chaplin is a brilliant cinematic story that has a fantastic cast and where the lead as Chaplin is managed brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr..  In addition, the story weaves in moments out of Chaplin's life where he got his ideas in an ingenious manner which displays the superb directing in the story.  When the audience sees everything put together they will experience a dazzling cinematic experience.",1073001600,40,969,4.842424242424243
73305,2,0784011680,"I can't understand why directors are drawn to biopics. They never seem to rise above the level of a better-than-average TV miniseries. And they generally gravitate to one extreme or the other: either the subject was a monster or a saint. Attenborough's Chaplin is in the latter category. At times it even seems like an apologia for the often maligned Chaplin, who some biographers accuse of misogynism, communism, and various sexual perversities. In contrast, Attenborough depicts Chaplin as an artist-hero who was highly principled but slightly flawed in his personal life. I admire Chaplin as an artist and even (with reservations) as a person.  I could have tolerated a more balanced depiction of this brilliant man. It would have made for a much better movie.
Robert Downey is a remarkable Chaplin, although he misses out on the sweetness that Chaplin could convey on screen. His imitation of Chaplin's other mannerisms is excellent. As an old man, the heavily made-up Downey eerily resembles a miniature Jabba the Hut. The primary purpose of the many supporting characters is to serve as foils to the greater glory of Chaplin, proving somewhat repetitiously that Chaplin was a man of deep principles and unbounded genius. Thus, these characters have little depth and aren't very interesting. The exception is Kevin Klein as Douglas Fairbanks. He contributes a nuanced and moving portrayal of the young vital Doug and, later, the old decaying Doug.
A final cavil: over the closing credits, we are informed how things turn out for the many supporting characters in this drama. The writers could apparently not resist the temptation to give Chaplin's enemies their just desserts. Thus, we are told that the ""bad"" characters (e.g., Joan and Mildred) end up in mental hospitals or dying through dissolution. Unfortunately, the actress Mabel Normand is placed in this category. As the movie depicts it, her inconsequential talents are contrasted against Chaplin's genius. It saddens me that the makers of Chaplin felt obliged to depict this remarkable woman in such a negative light. And in a final insult to Normand, her closing note dismissively states that she never made another movie after the murder of her alleged lover, William Desmond Taylor, in the early 1920s. This is inaccurate. Normand actually made several shorts for Hal Roach later in the decade, struggling without success to make a comeback before finally succumbing to tuberculosis.",1072224000,9,2451,5.1893939393939394

Footnote:
When all movies were still silent flickering images, Chaplin made features dealing with controversial topics such as racism, and fascism, which lead the US authorities, particularly J Edgar Hoover, to brand Chaplin a communist, and have him kicked out of the USA. Chaplin deserved better, and had to wait until the 1970s before he was remembered and recognised by his peers in America.",1049846400,,844,4.909090909090909
73307,3,0784011680,"It's hard to cover a life like that of Charlie Chaplin's in a short period of time (even if that ""short"" period is two and a half hours). The problem is, Richard Attenborough's ""Chaplin"" tries to cover way too much, and in the process fails to give us much insight on Chaplin or his times. On DVD, the scene selection option is terribly wonderful because the film give different aspects of Chaplin's life seperate, sketchy vignettes. His wives and mistresses are in it for two minutes apiece, ""The Great Dictator,"" ""City Lights,"" and ""Modern Times"" each have only one scene, and if you blink you might miss the coverage of ""The Gold Rush.""
The film is entertaining in that it is briskly paced, and the performances are good. Robert Downey Jr. should have won an Oscar, and supporting performers, especially Geraldine Chaplin, Kevin Kline, James Woods, and Dan Aykroyd, are great. But one reason their performances are so good is because they are given no challenge. Chaplin is the only character in this movie who has more than two dimensions.
The DVD fares better. Colours are good throughout, and there aren't any visual flaws worth noting. The menu interface is pretty neat.

Robert Downey, Jr. literally steals the show away from such heavyweights as Anthony Hopkins and the film's director, Richard Attenborough.
Though Attenborough, he himself an Oscar winning director, does some clever things to draw you into the world of Chaplin (making the film look old and distressed, using the same shakey ""hand-cranking"" speeds for action sequences, and use of moody, uneven lighting), his tempo for the film seems painfully slow at times, and at over two hours, the picture feels much longer.
The film is packed with stars in small roles, as everyone plays second banana to Chaplin--Marisa Tomei, Milla Jovovich, David Duchovney, Dan Akroyd, Moira Kelly, and Geraldine Chaplin, just to name a few.
