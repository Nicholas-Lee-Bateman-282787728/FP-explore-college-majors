I had aprehensions prior to watching this movie but I am glad i watched it. Great movie, Great acting and great songs... Don't miss ""Khali hai...."".

Great film by Amol Palekar !! well done!",1126483200,8,341,4.166666666666667
1571185,5,B00005JOJ8,"this is one of the best movies Shah Rokh Khan has acted in. It is a Rajasthani folktale, set in Rajasthan India. Beautiful costumes, sets and fun acting make it one of the best movies to come out of India. The music is fantastic. Khan produced the movie and it is one of his better productions.

1571278,3,B00005JOJ8,"I watched this on youtube.com so I cannot comment on the condition of the video. I am tempted to buy the movie because it is an entertaining love story starring Shah Rukh Khan. But my conscience won't let me buy it because the story is about adultery and is a little mean. You've got the new husband who is introverted, obsessed with being obedient to his dad by making a good living and he's kind of a snob. He finally comes to his senses and realizes he wants a relationship with his wife. But meanwhile she's been having an affair with a ghost, though at first, she thought it was her husband. When the husband shows up, the ghost usurps his position permanently, by trapping the husband's spirit in a container. Though it was interesting and one can't help get pulled into the love story between the wife and the ghost, it is not a nice story.",1464998400,,847,4.401273885350318

Shahrukh is one of our favorite actors however this movie there was nothing in it. it is an older movie. if you are one who likes the classic movies perhaps you would like this. it reminded me of the Charlie movie with the big rabbit. again we have bought many of his movies however this one we will be returning. we would like to see him do a American actors such as Terrence Howard,1433721600,,434,4.240963855421687

I loved everything about this ancient folktale brought to the screen by SRK , the beautiful Rani and the excellent supporting cast. The setting, the item numbers, the story line and the ending were so different from the usual Bollywood offerings. Please don't get me wrong, I love Bollywood films, but this clearly was a cut above many of them: Love stronger than death,  and sacrificial devotion, make this a folktale worth watching again and again. It is also a tear-jerker, so get the tissues ready. Great acting ! This is definitely a film that you should add to your Bollywood Film Library.",1421971200,,678,4.844827586206897

1571456,4,B00005JOJ8,The movie was very good and interesting and as usual Sharuk Khan's an Rani Mukerji's  acting was excellent and credible. What i didn't like is that recording included advertisements that interrupted the movie several times. That was very annoying  and broke the mood of the movie.

Look, I really really liked Paheli. Rani Mukerji was great in it, the music was pretty good and Sonu Nigam's voice is my life, but someone should have saved me from buying this DVD. I can take (even non-movie related) commercials and trailers before I get to the menu screen... I can even -maybe- accept the commercial (related to SRK) once I hit the play button, but I can't for the life of me accept to see commercials during the movie when I'm playing it on any disc.

I'm halfway through the movie and commercials (3 product ones) have played twice already- the first time before Dheere Jalna begins, and the other right after Kangna Re ends. I don't know if I'm going to run into more of the same three commercials.

1571552,4,B00005JOJ8,What can I say but that it was a beautifully made film. Shah Rukh and Rani have alot of chemistry on screen. The costumes and music was awesome. This is a movie worth buying. I recommend it to anyone. my niece didn't like Shah Rukh mustache in the film. Said she could not take him seriously with that mustache. lol. I heard He himself didn't like wearing it either.,1381276800,,366,4.318840579710145
1571553,5,B00005JOJ8,"This movie is perfect in every respect. I don't understand how this film was a flop in India, but they seem to understand the power and limitlessness of love better than anyone in Hollywood. This film is like a folk tale but it has an ageless quality to it that most folk tales don't have. It feels like it could be happening right now and it feels very truthful and relevant to everyone because everyone dreams of being loved like this. When I first saw Shah Rukh Khan's character Kishan, I was disappointed. I tend to expect Shah Rukh to be immediately magical and romantic but his character is a cowardly, shallow little man that is completely under his father's thumb (he seems to be afraid of his father). And his mustache and bad hat don't help matters. He can flippantly say to his sobbing new bride that he'll only be gone for five years, leaving her alone in a strange house with his family whom she doesn't yet know. He is obsessed with counting every penny he just spent on their wedding and he barely looks at his gorgeous new bride (Rani Mukherji) who is so sweet and so hopeful. You're pretty much hoping Kishan will meet some rabid camels on his travels to make more money. Then Shah Rukh appears as a ghost in the guise of Kishan and you sigh with relief. Although Rani's character Lachchi mistakes him for her husband, only kinder, the ghost lets her know he is a ghost and lets her decide to let him in her life or not. I like how they imply that a ghost is a better man than a man. That a ghost tells the truth when a man would lie and a ghost freely speaks his love and shows appreciation for his wife when a man doesn't feel it to be necessary. I love the spirit puppets that are like the ghost's conscience. This is the most romantic movie I've ever seen and it's so sweet and enchanting and soul-bending. There's not even any kissing, just nuzzling and caressing, and yet it is so passionate you feel like you should look away and yet you can't. It's very nice to see Juhi Chawla and Shah Rukh in a movie together again. Everyone in this movie does such a flawless job. Shah Rukh is tender and real and stunning, Rani is the definition of grace and beauty. This movie is three hours long, as all Bollywood movies are, but it passes so quickly, too quickly. I've watched this twice in a day many times. The soundtrack is epic and sweeping and has the full range of hopeful songs, sad songs, and celebratory songs. The first time I watched the movie, the minute the movie ended I was on the computer ordering the soundtrack. One of the best movies ever made, one of the best soundtracks ever made, breathtaking spiritual love story, gorgeous people, remarkable scenery. If you are reading these reviews and are considering purchasing this movie just stop, put it in your cart, check out and count the days until it arrives and be giddy.",1378684800,,2857,4.412878787878788

Movie Review: Paheli: Real Paheli
It is really a paheli, why amol palekar chose this theme, it is meant for whom, kids or adults, is it suited for today's time when some othe better theme could be taken and presented.

Although direction, cast, acting is marvellous but still movie has flopped, may be due to above reasons.

Movie starts with rajasthan background (deserts) and rani mukherjee (laachi) getting married to kishan who is the younger son of a baniya seth (anupam kher) of a village. Just on the way to his house while taking the new bride, the boy family plans to stop at a place to take some rest. This place is hosting some ghosts. a ghost gets admired by Laachi's beauty and starts loving her.

Laachi does not have her first night with her husband as kisan has to leave for a business tour for five years early in the morning and he has to finish and hand over some work to his father before he goes. (early morning is the best muhurat to start for business which will not come for next 7 years). so the new bride laachi sleeps alone and early morning kisan is moving. On his way, he stops at the same place of ghosts. this ghost talks to him and comes to know that kisan will be back after 5 years. This ghost is having very good character and never tells lies but never minds going to somebody else's wife and enjoy with her in his absence.

Now this ghost take the shape of kisan and comes to his father's house. convinces him that he is kisan and starts living with laaachi. Tells laachi what he is really and asks that if she does not want him to live there he will leave. She is seeking love and affection and hence She tells him to stay as her husband.

In a couple of years she becomes pregnant, real kisan comes back, and everybody gets surprised to find two kisan's. then comes the climax when the ghost decided to leave since he is not real but he just remembers he gave a promise to laachi.

So the real kisan goes and ghost comes back to laachi.

Cast, songs, direction is good but with a poor storyline.",1376956800,,2041,4.310704960835509
1571633,4,B00005JOJ8,"If it has a blue Sogo  and a Red Samay label on the dvd cover, it likely has ads embedded in the middle of the movie. At least that's what happened to me. Mine was a ""legitimate"" Eros--not pirated--copy, with a holographic Eros seal on the package and UPC code 2897010949. The store where I bought the dvd did not consider the commercials a defect, rather it was a ""manufacturer's choice"",  and so I was unable to return it.

The Sogo and Samay labels are tiny. They're printed in the lower righthand corner of the front plastic DVD cover, on the back of the cover, and on the dvd itself. The products in the ads are  Sogo and Samay products, so I think this might be how you can tell that the dvd you're getting has the embedded ads. My copy also had a price marked with a rupee symbol on the cover, I don't know if that's a clue or not.

I finally found a copy of Paheli without any ads interrupting the movie. Comes in a cardboard case, picture on front is a headshot of Shahrukh Khan in orange turban, but UPC code is the same.

The movie itself I like, of course. It's worth looking for an uninterrupted copy.",1374969600,2,1114,4.231132075471698
1571634,3,B00005JOJ8,"I'd seen this movie previously and LOVED the story. So when I saw a ""good price"" for the DVD I quickly bought it. How disappointed I was to find ads embedded EVERYWHERE that ruined my viewing experience for me. This had not happened to any of my other Bollywood DVDs and I sincerely hope this isn't going to happen to future DVDs--which I'll be very hesitant to buy for fear I'll have the same experience. The movie itself deserves five stars, but the DVD gets zero. This one is going back to the vendor.",1374969600,2,504,4.372340425531915
1571635,4,B00005JOJ8,This is one of my favorite Hindi movies. I thought the concept was unique and the characters were great. Never thought I would be rooting for a ghost to win the girl over an actual man.,1374537600,,185,4.166666666666667
1571636,5,B00005JOJ8,"Shah Rukh Khan plays double roles as he often does. These characters are opposites in body language and manner. Lots of fun to watch with folk tales, dances and customs of Rahjastan. Colors alone worth it. Enjoy. A plus.",1373846400,,220,4.666666666666667
1571637,5,B00005JOJ8,"This product exceeded my expectation. I use it frequently. It came in a colorful and sturdy package. This is a fantasy, with mystical features similar to the story in the movie ""Meet Joe Black"" with Bratt Pitt, only it's in a Hindu version. Lots of enjoyable color, music, Romance, and humor. A young woman enters into an unhappy arranged marriage because not realizing what was going to happen, her new husband immediately leaves on a business trip that will keep him away for several years. Meanwhile, a spirit being takes interest in her immediately after seeing her. The spirit transforms himself into the image of the woman's husband and thus the Romance begins between a spirit being and the woman who's grieving because of being separated from her husband. How the story plays out from there, the various circumstances that take place and certain entertaining events make the movie well worth viewing. Of course the language is in Hindi but it has English subtitles. Nonetheless, the movie is well worth that small inconvenience.  Shah Rukh Khan is superb portraying both characters, who are almost nothing alike.",1373846400,2,1120,5.021505376344086

1571640,3,B00005JOJ8,"This is really a great film, as many others have discussed at length in their reviews. However, Eros film company has decided to interrupt it at least 4 times with ads!

Months pass before the bridegroom realizing his mistake starts yearning for his wife.  He sends a letter to his Father wanting news of the family.  Confusing episodes caused by the ghost, follows the letter and the letter carrier.  The bridegroom then hears news of his wife's pregnancy and birth of the baby and returns home to deal with the situation!

1571723,3,B00005JOJ8,"This was a cute movie if you don't read too much into it. The dance numbers are fun and the characters are interesting as is the story.

Definitely one to have for your Bollywood collection. Rani is great, as always. But the songs weren't as catchy as some other films. Super story.",1306972800,,320,4.17741935483871
1571727,3,B00005JOJ8,"My main complaint about the film is that it was just too long. The story takes place during a 5-year period, and sometimes it feels like the movie will END in 5 years! Well, it's really 2 hours and 20 minutes. The movie is about a spirit who takes the form of a newly wed woman's husband for 4-5 years, while the real husband is away on a business trip and neglecting his wife. Clearly, the spirit and the wife bond in that time period, but this becomes too drawn out in the movie. I left the TV with the film on for almost an hour, and when I came back, the story hadn't progressed that much further. The producers should have shortened the middle part of the movie. Also, since it's a 2005 film, and there have been so many movies produced inside and outside of Bollywood with an actor playing a dual role by this time, the doppelganger scenes are not that impressive, either.

Otherwise, it was an okay movie. I must admit the costume and set design was gorgeous. In fact, the movie won an award for best art direction. Do an image search for ""Paheli"" and see for yourself.

The lessons in the movie were pretty good too. The wife learns early on that the man who is living with her is not her real husband. Faced with a difficult situation, she must decide if she should remain faithful to her true husband, or love a spirit who is more affectionate towards her than her husband will ever be. In a way, the movie also encourages adults to focus on their significant others rather than increasing their material wealth.",1296604800,,1522,4.374558303886926
1571728,3,B00005JOJ8,"There aren't too many places in the world more fantastic--in the truest sense of the word--than Rajasthan. The sandswept beauty, the rich culture--it's like nowhere else. The colors there alone seem too vibrant to be real. And it stands to reason that fairy-tale lands would produce wonderful fairy tales. 'Paheli' is a delightful story from Rajasthani folklore about a neglected wife who finds the man of her dreams in the form of an amorous ghost.

Lachchi (Rani Mukerji) is married to a man she doesn't know and sent away from her home and family to live in his village. She's sad to leave, but excited about her new life as the wife of a wealthy merchant. To her great disappointment, her husband, Kishan (Shahrukh Khan), turns out to be a plodding bore who's only interested in running the family business. He finds his vivacious, sensual bride distasteful and refuses to bed her on their wedding night, despite her prodding. The very next morning, he sets off to start a business venture in a faraway city, where he plans to stay for five years, leaving his distraught wife behind. There's a history of abandonment in Kishan's family--his older brother (Suniel Shetty) did the same thing to his wife (Juhi Chawla). A ghost (also played by Khan) falls in love with Lachchi and assumes a human form that looks just like Kishan, and he shows up at the family mansion, pretending to be the runaway groom.

It's an interesting double role for Khan, and he has fun with the characters--the ghost, in particular, who relishes every aspect of life as a human--the splash of water in the bath, a mother's tender touch on his cheek, and especially the love of the irresistible Lachchi. The ghost doesn't lie to her about who he is, and while she's torn about being unfaithful to her husband, she gives in to the attentive and passionate ghost because he's everything she wants. Everyone else believes he's Kishan, and maintaining the charade, as evidence to the contrary mounts, is the source of conflict, culminating in Kishan's inevitable return. By that time, we learn that Kishan isn't such a bad guy--just desperate to please his father (Aunupam Kher) with profits--and he starts to long for Lachchi during his exile. He has a right to be upset because he is, after all, being cuckolded by someone who stole his identity. Why the filmmakers cultivate this sympathy for Kishan, when the ghost is the hero of the story, is confusing.

A no-nonsense shepherd (Amitabh Bachchan) offers a solution to the dilemma, and it's resolved--as is often the case in fairy tales--all too conveniently.

The costuming, dancing, singing are great, and the movie includes some of the rituals unfamiliar to our students.

1571731,5,B00005JOJ8,"The plot of the movie has been described in other reviews on this board.  Suffice it to say that, as in many Shah Rukh Khan films, there is an underlying message in the plot, which is that spirit animates beauty and that we are more than the sum of our bodies.

SRK is well known as the King of Bollywood, but this does not begin to capture the ability of this actor to go beyond acting and to actually become the charcater he is playing.  In this film, he plays the role of the husband and the role of a ghost posing as the husband in the husband's body.  There are no artificial props indicating a switch in charcaters, but you can tell who is the husband and who the ghost because Khan's face literally changes.  So, to call Khan the King of Bollywood is to demean the standing of a very fine actor, a world-class actor, whose presence would grace any screen and production--be it Indian, British, or American.  In fact, it is my belief that American producers will soon come to recognize this man's talent and worldwide appeal and will begin to offer him substantial roles.

The other great feature of this film is Rani Mukherji as the wife.  She is also a very fine dramatic actress, quite equal to the task of playing opposite Khan.  There are several scenes in which she dances in a traditional Indian style and she floats above ground as a flash of fluid color.  Beautiful.

This has not been one of Khan's more commercial films and it did not do terribly well in India.  But it is a film well worth having in your library.",1231545600,4,1531,4.371024734982332

There were oxen pulling carts and the Indian version of women in distress.

Interested only in securing a profitable marriage, as Dr. Z's wife did, they seek out ways to show their value and wealth.  According to Zuleha, he told her father that he would return to America where he had obtained his training in the windy city, Chicago, Illinois, else he would marry a rich American woman.

The DVD comes in a regular DVD case with a plain blue sleeve that says Paheli and Eros International on the front, with a description and barcode on the back.  Then, when I put it into my computer to play it, the colors are way off.  The picture has lines running through it horizontally, and vertical lines of color show up periodically.  The red color is out of sink with the rest of the picture, so you have red ghosts next to the item that is supposed to be red.

Synopsis: Lachchi (Rani Mukherjee) has just married Kishanial (Shah Rukh Khan), eldest son of a wealthy business family obsessed with continually adding to their enormous monetary treasure. On their wedding night Kishanial informs his new wife that he will forego the sexual pleasures of their first embrace in order to prepare for a business trip in the morning, a journey that will last five long years. The joys of marital bliss seem to be unattainable for the lovely bride until Kishanial unexpectedly returns home three days later.

1571893,5,B00005JOJ8,"Of all the Hindi (""Bollywood"") films I have seen in the past year or so, ""Paheli"" stands out as very special in many ways, and together with its presentation in a gorgeous box I think this DVD even deserves a 6-star rating.  Some of this film's outstanding features which impressed me the most are first of all the absolutely stunning feast of colours, beautiful and amazing sets and overall superb photography, all filmed in India's most fascinating region, Rajasthan.  Having toured Rajasthan over 10 years ago, this aspect had special significance for me, but I'm sure every viewer would be amazed by the breathtaking beauty of the traditional buildings and costumes in particular.  Some other Indian and Rajasthan traditions are also incorporated in this delightful fantasy story based on Rajasthan folklore, giving the viewer a delicious taste of India which is not often seen in most popular Bollywood movies.  In fact, anyone used to the popular run-of-the-mill Bollywood output might be very surprised by ""Paheli"" due to its `traditional purity'; its focus solely on a Rajasthan folktale set somewhere in the past using pure Hindi language (ie, no English words frequently thrown in) and shot on location in Rajasthan, India.  Nevertheless, ""Paheli"" still has all the typical Bollywood ingredients such as a song and dance every 20 minutes or so, a sentimental love story and a star-studded cast.  The music, like the story and scenes, are also purely Indian and are played on traditional instruments, which was also a highlight for me personally.

For those in the know, ""Paheli"" boasts some of India's top stars, all of whom give some of their best performances in this film.  Often referred to as `the King of Bollywood', Shahrukh Khan excels himself in this dual role as the leading man and his double: a ghost who impersonates him.  (Impressive special effects also rate highly in this film such as the ghost's `tricks' and scenes in which man and ghost interact with each other)  His leading lady (once again) is Rani Mukherjee, one of the many stunningly beautiful Indian actresses who have talent and skills as well as beauty.  And I always enjoy the great Amitabh Bachchan, this time in only a small but pivotal role as an old desert shepherd who solves the riddle ('Paheli' means riddle) of which of the two identical men is the man and which one the ghost.  It's always a treat for me to see Anupam Kher in one of his good character roles, this time as Shahrukh's greedy businessman father, and the lovely Juhi Chawla also offers a small supporting role.  For dazzling Bollywood stars, ""Paheli"" is sure to please, and for the complete novice to Indian cinema this film's many other superior features are sure to surprise and impress.  And for a little extra depth and behind-the-scenes insight, this DVD has among its bonus features a 30-minute ""The Making of..."" documentary which sheds some light onto the stars' own views on the value and message of the film for today's audience.  My only complaint (though a very small one) is that some of this documentary's dialogue is in Hindi without any subtitles, but for the most part it is informative and enjoyable, and helps the viewer to appreciate ""Paheli"" even more.  Another enjoyable bonus feature on the DVD is a CD launch with interviews with the stars. Bollywood fan or not, this is a special film worth seeing!",1142121600,36,3386,4.893356643356643
1571894,5,B00005JOJ8,"""Life, burn slowly""  -Dharelee jeli (?) in Hindi- is the title of one of the songs inside this Indian film. It is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, and, like the rest of the film, tells us to enjoy life as we get it. Ironically, it is a ghost (Sharukh Khan) who must show us how much life is worthwhile.

The plot for this wonderful Indian movie is inspired on an old folk tale, a love story that tells the dilemma faced by Lachcho when an incarnated ghost takes the place of her absent husband. The husband (played by Sharukh Khan, too) has never really been anything but cold towards her, giving more importance to material gains than to his new relationship, and not caring for his new wife's feelings to the point of abandoning her in pursuit of riches after the wedding night. In steps the ghost, who fell in love with the young bride after just a glimpse of her while she was travelling to her new home. The ghost is grateful for this opportunity of tasting life in the place of Lachcho's reluctant husband, but immediately decides against doing this at the cost of Lachcho's feelings or dignity: he tells her from the beginning that he is not her husband, declares his love and lets her decide what she wants to do.

This opportunity to decide is a deeply moving moment for Lachcho, who has never in her life been asked her opinion, not even about her own life. And this dilemma provides the vehicle for one of the movie's most important themes: the dignity that comes with making our own decissions and taking responsibility for our lives; a dignity that, unfortunately, is denied to many women.

How like Bollywood to make a film that can be ""read"" at several levels, where there is all the glamorous entertainment typical of Indian films -music,songs, gorgeous clothes, bright colours...- and ethical themes that provide food for thought. And it really is like that: Sharukh Khan is his old charming and adorable self (and getting better and better at acting; I hope he NEVER retires !!!), Rani Mukherji has just the right chemistry for him, none eclipsing the other (although she's strikingly beautiful and quite a good actress), the music and songs have to be some of THE BEST I've ever heard in my life, the local setting in Rajastan is so intriguing that it takes an effort not to beging packing your bags to go there immediately.

And all in all, the ""paheli"" or dilemma/riddle for me is....how can you pretend to have any kind of relationship with someone if you don't give him/her the oportunity to choose? The answer is that this is, of course, impossible: there is no love without freedom of choice.",1140307200,25,2633,4.605543710021322

Lachchi (Rani Mukherjee) is a beautiful young woman, who is married to Kishan (Shah Rukh Khan), a man only interested in tabulating the costs of his wedding, on the night the young couple should be honeymooning (!).

1571897,5,B00005JOJ8,"Released in a popular program of Bollywood films to our Aussie cinemas, joining the opening night crowd was a thrill & delight.  The hordes of ex-pat and Australian born Indians who flocked to the theater brought a tingle of excitment and deliciously foreign banter.

Enjoying the film with the commentary of three Indian youths behind my party was a most amusing experience as they poohed and pahhed all the parts we loved best! (the dancing, the romance, the profile... heh heh)

For an excellent overview of the movie Paheli I must recommend the unusually well made official website: (...)

Opening on scenes of a wedding preparation, Rani Mukherjee is Lachchi, who is about to marry Kishen (played most cleverly by Shah Rukh Khan).

Marrying only to to please his parents, Kishen is displeased with Lachchi even on their wedding journey and immediately upon delivering her to the family home he departs upon business.

Devestated Lachchi welcomes his simulcrum home with great surprise when he appears unannounced and unexpected upon the doorstep... In fact a ghost has taken the shape of her husband due to infatuation.

What follows is at times poignant, moving, and humorous.

Exquisite costumes in the Rajastani style are most abundantly presented and for me gave the film extra luster and the dances a special presence. All the actresses are exceptionally beautiful and the scenes beautifully cheographed and filmed.

Shah Rukh Khan's comic timing is proven, if one had not already accepted it, whilst his co-star Rani Mukherjee shines and glows.

A vibrant exciting journey which you will enjoy most wholeheartedly was brought to the screen by director Amol Palekar.  Apparently based upon a famous folk story written by Vijayadan Detha, it could not more vividly appeal to the eye and satisfy the mind.

Watch for the surprise ending!

7941914,1,B00005JOJ8,"unless you can tolerate the loud, obnoxious commercials that Eros International has inserted into the film itself  in four places, no less! This is an exquisite folktale, beautifully filmed and sensitively acted. The delicate mood is totally ruined by these ads that break into it at random spots. I first saw a library copy, apparently the first DVD release, which did not have commercials in the film itself. I loved it and wanted to own it to watch over and over. Ive ordered it three times now and keep being sent the Eros version with these horrible ads. (The tipoff is the two small logos on the lower right corner of the case.) A few months ago I thought I was the only one receiving these marred DVDs, but now I see from the reviews that others have gotten them and object to them like I do. Its the first  and I hope only  time Ive seen a film with this terrible format. So disappointing! Someday I hope to find the original version without the ads.",1477872000,2,958,4.431818181818182

7941918,4,B00005JOJ8,"I watched this movie over seven years ago and fell in love with the story and the characters. My friend let me borrow her copy, and I secretly wish I had kept it.

I'm not sure if everyone's copy is like mine, but periodically throughout the movie there are advertisements that abruptly cut the movie off, which always seems to happen right when you don't want the movie to suddenly stop. I don't remember my friend's copy having these interruptions, which is why I'm disappointed and only gave it 4 stars.

The movie is great, but it feels like there are toooooo many advertisements (and interruptions for advertisements) that distract you from the beautiful story. It's a shame really.",1472342400,,687,4.764705882352941
