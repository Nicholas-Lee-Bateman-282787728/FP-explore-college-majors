8256525,2,B0014W2G1O,"I ordered this CD with some trepidation, as the description and two reviews do not convey what level of player the DVD is intended for. But the lack of useful material on the market, and of a teacher, drove me to take a chance. It was a mistake.

The initial sections on posture, right hand technique and bellows  were, as expected, rank beginner's material.

I was shocked, when Murray began to demonstrate bass chord patterns, because he chose to select a piece requiring a chord which his 72 bass accordion lacks, C# min. So, he approximates with a two-button combination, C# min 7th. The next chord could be D Maj but Murray prefers another combined chord, B min 7th, followed by yet another two-button suspended chord! These three advanced chords require difficult fingering, and much practice to master. Chord combining is advanced stuff and quite out of balance with the previous sections. Now, I'm all in favor with getting away from bass monotony, but the solutions suggested are not accessible to beginning and early intermediate payers in my opinion: there is so much material that must first be learned about simpler chords that can add color to a piece.

The rest of the DVD is about developing four somewhat similar but unfamiliar traditional folk melodies into more decorated pieces. More advanced players who are interested in experimenting with the folk genre may perhaps find some useful ideas here.

I conclude that this DVD is too mixed in content: the first half contains basic material for a beginner which can be found many places, but the second will be out of his reach. Those who can use the second half will not need the first.

""Mastering the Art"" is a great overstatement. 2 stars for being useful to a minority.",1384214400,,1741,4.806020066889632
8256526,5,B0014W2G1O,Murray is an outstanding musician and accordionist.  He has honed the skills of his God given musical talents and demonstrates those skills while simultaneously inspiring the viewer to play more beautifully.,1367107200,,207,5.67741935483871
8256527,3,B0014W2G1O,"Excellent five star material for the price of a lesson.  I am new to the piano accordion.  This instruction will give me food for thought for coming years.  The presentation covers several technical aspect of playing.  It's well organized and endorsed by Karen Tweed (one of my favorite accordionists).  If only it played on my DVD players.

The disc is double sided.  NTSC on one side.  PAL format on the other.  The main menu comes up, but I'm unable to select anything to play.  It's the first DVD I've found that hasn't worked with my OPPO DVD players -- which are PAL capable.  I hope the producers of this DVD further test it's playability and fix its compatibility issues.

I would return it if it were not such an excellent tutorial.  I am able to view the material on my computer using Windows Media Player.  That will suffice for my needs.

My thanks to Murray Grainger for his no nonsense presentation of this material.
Shame on the folks who mastered these DVD.",1331683200,2,973,4.575581395348837
