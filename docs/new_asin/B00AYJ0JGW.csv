Well, when the package arrived, he thought it was the copy of Apocalypse Now and he opened it.  The package was very discreet and nondescript!  He was truly shocked and happy, also contemplated tapping it back together before I got home.  We ended up watching it that night, he was very pleased.",1364428800,,413,4.466666666666667

5528470,4,B00AYJ0JGW,"I'm a currently inactive (since I sold my Stinson) private pilot so The Aviators has been a way to remember some of the joys of flying. For me it wasn't just about getting somewhere but the also joy of the trip. I was also after the ultimate $100 burger which eventually showed up in Fields Oregon. And if you wonder how I landed there (no official airport) it was on a dirt car track that paralleled the paved hiway.  That track was directly across from the tiny diner that marked the North, South, East, and West edges of Fields. I wasn't the first to land on that 1000' of dust nor, I'm sure, the last. The shake was very good also.",1444435200,,635,4.24793388429752

5528512,3,B00AYJ0JGW,"After thoroughly enjoying the first two seasons of The Aviators, I am compelled to rate this third season as a 'mostly enjoyed'. The thing I did not enjoy was that often the background music overpowered the narration to a level which made it very hard to hear what was being said.",1404432000,,280,4.509803921568627

5528536,5,B00AYJ0JGW,"The Aviators is about flying, the people who love flying, and the planes they fly.  That may seem obvious but one just needs to look at the various ""reality shows"" that are on television now that are more about drama between the ""celebrities"" on the show than the title.
The Aviators covers all a variety of aviation subjects including Air Traffic Control, airline operations, the back stage operations at air shows, as well as safety tips.  They have a variety of excellent commentators that are more interested in getting the story told than being a celebrity.
Great show, looking forward to season 4.",1377993600,,603,4.844660194174757

5528543,3,B00AYJ0JGW,"After an extremely rocky first season, there must have been a shake up a the top (ownership changes?) because this series got a lot better.  However, it was so bad; so amatuerish and  lame in its first episodes, that even with huge improvements, ""The Aviators"" still feels like a bunch of local-tv-station characters trying to do national quality production.  They don't make it -- don't come close actually -- but it remains an interesting concept and the content somehow rises above the semi-pro production values now and then to be entertaining.",1370649600,,548,5.0
