6761263,5,B00OU4MP0K,Best show ever!!!!,1416873600,4,18,5.333333333333333
6761264,5,B00OU4MP0K,I purchased this series from amazon UK in the Region 2/PAL version. All five episodes are excellent. The actor replacing Jason Hughes is very good and blends in smoothly with the rest of the cast. I really liked Jason Hughes (as DS Jones) and hated to see him leave but I think the new actor makes a good replacement. I think the running time for the series since John Nettles left is usually about 90 minutes whereas the original series with Mr. Nettles ran about 100 minutes. Even so these are excellent stories once you realize that Neil Dudgeon has different approach to the story and is not a Tom Barnaby clone. I was very happy to see the series continue. I don't get too concerned about run times as long as the show is entertaining and well done. I think Midsomer fans will be very well pleased with this set of mysteries.,1416700800,148,830,4.431372549019608

6761266,1,B00OU4MP0K,"IMDb lists run times for these five episodes as 489 minutes but the product details say this set is 370.  Something is incorrect in the product specifications for this Amazon listing.  Is this set just four episodes or are they cut up so much as to make them undesirable.  If either is the case, I will only be able to give this set a one star rating.",1414886400,28,351,4.208955223880597

6761279,4,B00OU4MP0K,"I have been a fan of Midsomer Murders for quite a while.  It was hard to see John Nettles go, but Neil is doing a good job.  He plays John Barnaby as intelligent, educated, and experienced.  I love his wife... she helps him be more considerate to others at times... and is so pleasant ...  you can't help but like her.  Sykes their dog cracks me up.  That dog is just plain smart.  I recommend the show.",1466899200,,403,4.1558441558441555
6761280,1,B00OU4MP0K,"I have struggled to find some redeeming value in the new Barnaby.  No such luck.

The strange choice to assume that fans of Midsomer Murders are stupid is a huge mistake.  Trying to make this new Barnaby so much smarter than his staff is not only annoying, it is completely juvenile. There is nothing in the material to prove it. Dumb down the co-stars so a narcissistic copper looks brilliant?  Ridiculous.

While I agree that John Nettles was quite irritating when he chose to speak in such a way as to grate the nerves of anyone trying to listen to the dialogue rather than the accent that is anything but organic  was a bad choice by the actor.  I forgive him.

Beyond that, we all knew that something was wrong with his health and worried about it as he truly did become a part of his follower's fantasy family.  Week after week  we heard the actor struggle to breathe and the concern his fans were expressing online made it apparent that there was trouble brewing.  I have read threads on MM fan blogs and found many people wanting to know what might have been  happening to him. And still he is loved  ""as is"".

It astonishes me that Neil Dudgeon is the replacement for John Nettles.  Woe is me!
I cannot help but wonder how much influence Dudgeon has over the scripts.  His character appears smug and such a poseur that I find it difficult to watch him, much less allow the necessary giving into the plot.

The childish stabs made towards his sidekick induce nausea.  Since when would a truly good detective be so silly as to think hurling insults would make him appear anything but common and petty?  It is difficult to recognize if his insults are meant to be humorous  as they are so poorly delivered.  I always got the humor from Nettles in his put-downs but feel uncomfortable when Dudgeon delivers his jabs.

As the daughter of a real detective, I find all of this no more than Hollywood type drivel and yet, I cannot  compare American detective shows to those in the UK unless we travel back in time.  No need to do that as I am well aware that the UK owns the realm.  But, we do have Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett.

Dudgeon seems pudgy, oily and married to a female character with the sole purpose to pretend a healthy home relationship. Oh, how now! Not totally unlike the Tom B household but sheer nonsense in the John B's home.  His behavior from the first episode showed me a selfish man with an out of control ego and unwarranted contempt for his neighbors.  As for the pup, an adorable prop.

Stop making everyone surrounding him seem so stupid when in fact, the Dudgeon character is obviously  a sad case of arrested development bringing to mind those absurd women who think because they are beautiful, no one else is.

I have had to resolve myself to watching the original series episodes to the point that I cannot watch any of it any longer.  It makes me too sad.

Hire better writers.  Tell the ""star"" he isn't attractive when he poses, especially that pursed lips bit.  I cringe every time I see it!

It is heartbreaking to see what has been done to the stories.

Bring back True-May and Horowitz.  That stupid and fear based politically correct choice to remove them was weak.  Rewriting history and once again trying to make yourself seem smart at the expense of your audience's ability to know what is historically accurate makes me sad beyond compare.

Know your audience, PLEASE.

6761282,3,B00OU4MP0K,"Ok, I take it this is the same as series 16. I would have given this 4 stars except for the seemingly deliberate confusion caused by the back and forth numbering system.  I have ended up with 2 of the same thing in other programs in the past which makes me think it's a deliberate attempt to get us to buy something again. The shows themselves are almost as good as always, but I'm becoming disenchanted with the amount of detective work I must do to determine what I'm actually getting.

Many of the scenes seem to be split between lots of time in the station.  The new kid is really good and it would be nice if he took over and the one who plays Barnaby goes away.  Most of the scenes seem to be filmed apart from the two characters unlike the old Midsomer and Barnaby does not seem to treat this new one so much like an idiot and unpleasant as Jones.

This is really no longer Midsomer Murders, it is like all these types of shows now, nothing different from all the others on TV.  If you like those types of shows then this one is for you.",1430179200,3,684,4.067164179104478

6761558,5,B00OU4MP0K,"Midsomer Murders is a veritable institution in Great Britain, a program so beloved that it invites comparison to ""the good old days"" when families would ritually gather around the radio (then, later, the telly) to enjoy their favourite program. So how does a show so enjoyed by so many stay fresh, while at the same time maintaining many of the elements that helped establish it as a perennial?

Change is inevitable, and necessary, but perhaps the answer lies in understanding the delicate balance between what can and should be changed and what must be left well enough alone. Judging by the five episodes that make up the latest DVD release of this series, the makers of Midsomer Murders have found that balance.

Usually, Midsomer Murders is released in sets of four, sometimes three episodes. Set 25 includes five episodes for the simple reason that the last episode of this three disc box set is the landmark one hundredth episode of the series, an important milestone indeed!

Also of note, and arguably the biggest change here, is the departure of Jason Hughes as DS Ben Jones and the arrival of his replacement, Gwylym Lee as DS Charlie Nelson.  Lee has a laid back, almost laconic quality while at the same time projecting the desire to please his new boss.  Lee is a terrific actor and the transition from the much-loved Jason Hughes is as smooth as it can be.

Sykes, the Barnaby's adorable Jack Russell terrier, continues to evolve into a wonderful supporting character always good for a laugh. In this set he even pulls at our heart strings when he appears to become ill, when in truth he is displaying some pre-baby anxiety. And of course, the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Barnaby's new-born is a touch of colour that just wouldn't have been possible back when the great John Nettles was spear-heading the show.

The mysteries are all first rate, and the special, 100th episode sees a collaboration with Danish police which is as much a nod to the recent success and quality of some recent police procedurals from the Scandinavian countries as it is an opportunity to enjoy a literal change of scenery. Some first-rate Danish actors, such as Birgitte Hjort Sorensen, from such recent Danish hits like Borgen, also provide some temporary new blood.

If there is anything to fault in these five additions to the Midsomer Murders canon, I fail to see it. Midsomer Murders fits like a well-worn pair of shoes, but without the need for re-soling. And that is comfort with a capital C.",1428969600,,2489,4.772093023255814

In spite of that the show continues to be a solid hit. Mainly because it delivers good murder mysteries.  It will never reach the quirkiness of it's earlier series probably again.  They could use some of that , BUT it's still a fine show to watch and enjoy.  the new main detective has made the show his own and he's very comfortable in the role.  The new jr. detective is doing a fine job as well.  So we still have this fine show to continue on watching.  It's one of the longest detective shows in history for sure.  I do miss 'a touch of frost' which ran for a long while, but it was different.  This one however looks great on dvd and even better on blu ray. If you can watch it that way. IN hd that is.  I don't understand why some American network won't show these again!  They should.",1426982400,,925,4.163841807909605

He seems like a more hands-on kind of guy and physically able to tackle the ""grittier"" aspects of the job.  We've only watched 2 of the episodes so far, and the scenery looks a little different ~ not quite as bucolic  as the old Midsomer Villages used to look.  A little surprised that the Barnabys are expecting a baby.  She always appeared to be totally wrapped up in her job before with scarcely any spare time.

6761634,5,B00OU4MP0K,"We liked Barnaby's new sidekick.  He seemed more intelligent and proactive that either of his two predecessors.  As usual, the stories are superb, well acted, and well filmed.  And the DVD video quality is excellent - nearly HD quality.  We anxiously await set 26, which has not yet been listed on Amazon.com.

The set has five episodes on three disks, for about 470 minutes of television.

We own all 25 sets, and this one ranks among the best.

Edited to add two additional comments:

1) Neil Dudgeon, the actor who plays John Barnaby, also appeared in an early episode, ""The Garden of Death"", in set #3.
2) Hitchcock fans will experience a bit of deja vu in one of the episodes.  I won't say more.",1425427200,2,700,4.536

The loss of Ben was easy to get used to with the replacement actor Gwilym Lee who is likeable and does a great job, which isn't easy, when you have to fill the shoes of a fellow actor who did a lot of episodes in the past.  The Christmas Haunting was a nice start to the box series, but Let Us Prey was the stuff of previous Midsomer Murders and the following episodes were just as good if not better, and the fourth episode filmed in  Copenhagen was beautiful, especially in Blu-Ray.  Well worth the wait and reasonably priced.  I liked it very much and look forward to set 26.

Love the music as so original for the beginning and end of episodes. As a lover of mysteries I have problem picking out the perps sometime because the stories are so well written. When Tom retired I was concerned but Neil has stepped in and done a fine job and he gets better with each episode. I am going to miss Jason a lot and wish him well.

The transition to a new Detective Chief Inspector and Detective Sargent is good but no real edgy or quirkiness that would engage the viewer.

Maybe the writing wasn't as good as previous series, and also the actors seemed to be getting used to acting with each other.  But, as things went along, things got better and we think we're going to like the actor who plays 'Nelson'.  He is a different character from Jones, but he has his own unique talents to bring to the series.  Of course, Neil Dudgeon, as always, gives a good, laid back performance.  We like MidSomer Murders because they are entertaining, have some 'unusual murders', but aren't gory or upsetting.  Just good British acting that we love!",1425081600,3,691,4.48

New characters are introduced, and it did not take long to welcome them. It made the last if the series a little more exciting. I was given this series from a pal in the UK.

Seargeant Jones has left Midsomer, and we meet DS Charlie Nelson. He is young with city experience and wonders if country life will suit him. However, he is more than willing to give it a try. Neil Dudgeon continues to play John Barnaby, and the mysteries and murders continue. We meet Barbaby's wife, and they are expecting a baby. One of the episodes that takes place in Denmark, is near the birth, and Barnaby wonders if he should take the trip. This episode was one of my favorites. It incorporated some of the characters from Borgen, one of my favorite series. The other episodes are very well done, and the last episode, well..wait and see.

6761650,5,B00OU4MP0K,"MIDSOMER MURDERS, SET 25 here makes its North American and Blu-Ray debut. The highly popular and praised, long-running British television series, a crime/drama/mystery, premiered in the United Kingdom in March 1997. This set contains the series 100th  feature-length episode, with more new episodes still in production. In the United States, the British mystery series has been seen on A & E, the Biography Channel and public television stations. However, these episodes of set 25, which were debuted in the U.K. in Series 16, were first broadcast first exclusively in the U.S. on Acorn TV. The current release consists of five contemporary feature-length standalone police procedurals, set, as their predecessors, in the gorgeous, picture perfect, but evidently dangerous precincts of Midsomer County. The DVD release is a boxed set of three disks, runs approximately 463 minutes, plus extras, consisting of: celebrating 100 Episodes (17 minutes), an interview with the newly-cast actor Gwilym Lee, a behind-the-scenes featurette and photo galleries. And subtitles, though the latter are hardly needed as the cast speaks the Queens English and the sound is crystal clear. I received this as a review copy.

In the current release of this very lively and enjoyable series, John Barnaby, played by Neil Dudgeon, (LIFE OF RILEY), has capably taken over the duties at the cop shop formerly performed by his older cousin Tom Barnaby, (John Nettles). Dudgeon is a more expressive actor than Nettles, with better coming timing, so this is all to the good.  Barnaby is here assisted by a new protg, Detective Sergeant, Charley Nelson, played by Gwilym Lee, (LAND GIRLS). Barnabys wife is exceedingly pregnant and cheerful, almost ready to pop.  They are therefore giving extra attention to Sykes, their dog.  Guest stars include Michael Jayston, (TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY); Sharon Small, (the Inspector Lynley Mysteries); Robert Bathurst, (DOWNTON ABBEY), and Hayley Mills (THE PARENT TRAP).

The episodes are, with thanks to Acorn:

Disc 1
The Christmas Haunting
DS Charlie Nelson arrives in Midsomer to be DCI Barnaby's new partner. His first case involves a stabbing death during a ghost-hunting party at the Morton Shallows manor house. Further deaths follow.

Let Us Prey
Nurse Nancy Dewar is discovered dead in the river with a mask over her heada spectacle eerily similar to one depicted on a medieval fresco just discovered behind a wall in the church crypt at Midsomer St. Claire. More murders follow, each replicating scenes from the fresco.

Disc 2
Wild Harvest
Wealthy farmer Martin Strickland is discovered, mauled to death by wild boars.  His death is linked to a local restaurant, Wyvern House, run by celebrity chef Ruth Cameron.

The Flying Club
The pilot/co-owner of Finchmere Airfield is killed, dropped from a plane into a reservoir below. The pilots have been preparing for an upcoming air show.

Disc 3
The Killings of Copenhagen
The head of Calder's Biscuits dies on a business trip to Copenhagen. After finding that the businessman was poisoned by a biscuit tin sent from Midsomer, the Danish detective asks Barnaby to join the inquiry.

MIDSOMER is based on the novels of Caroline Graham, modern master of the English village mystery, praised as the best detective writer since Agatha Christie by the Sunday Times, UK. And it is amazing what goes on behind the nicely-manicured nails and the carefully-trimmed hair, and the equally carefully trimmed hedges of the fictional county: homicide, blackmail, betrayal.  The photography is fine; the scenery is lush; the acting is good; the mysteries are light, entertaining, without bloodshed or violence; the plots, imaginative and original, laced with humor. Its no wonder that this series has proven so perennially popular.",1423612800,2,3789,5.2724252491694354
6761651,5,B00OU4MP0K,"Since 1997 there is no end in sight anytime soon for murders in Midsomer.
Landscape settings, classic idyllic country England is a signature element assuring years to come. We own every episode on DVD and re-watch them for the beauty, even knowing who-dun-it. Midsomer Murders, each unique, grow in bunches like grapes. The best of UK actors beg to be guest stars. Above all, it's quality writing. It has had major changes since the inception, survived and grown stronger.
I've identified only a few of the guest stars and with them indicated major series they were in of which are also ""MUST VIEW"" DVDs. All 5-stars+++, like Midsomer.

Small regular cast DCI Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon); his wife (Fiona Dolman is super) with `Bump'; Dr Wilding (Tamzin Malleson); and new is DS Nelson (Gwilyn Lee who was superb in the fantastic series ""Land Girls"").

SDH SUBTITLES for each episode plus video bonus segments
Remember you must check out DVDs in (...) & "".""
1==THE CHRISTMAS HAUNTING==Mark Heap (""Lark Rise and Candleford"" postman) as Simon who owns the hunted Manor House. Not as ghostly as murderous--but in such a lovely setting. Ollie played by James Murray (""Under the Greenwood Tree""). Murder weapons include Victorian sward, blacksmith hammer, and a Christmas card from the past is heartwarming.
2==LET US PREY==Church crypt's Medieval fresco duplicates murders by hooded drowning, stoning, impaling by wheel; except the murders take place now, by who? Michael Jayston (Dame Cookson's ""Dinner of Herbs"") is Rev Gould. Frank played by Paul Dopley (""Downton Abbey"").
3==WILD HARVEST==A bear mauling while tied to a tree, a magic mushroom swap, and mixed drink are murder tools. Sharon Small seen from ""Insp Lynley Mysteries"".
4==THE FLYING CLUB==Robert Bathurst (Strallan on ""Downton Abbey"") stars. The episode is about ATA, WW2 lady pilots. Filmed at the preserved White Waltham Airfield. It begins with an airdrop into a lake while unconscious; a new murder technique even for Midsomer. It catches on as a 2nd murder is a tire blow to the head from a flying plane.
5==100th==THE KILLINGS OF COPENHAGEN==A theme of children & parents. This 100th (like another from this set) is written by Paul Logue who cut his script editing teeth on ""Monarch of the Glen"", a Brit classic. A Badger's Woods man is murdered in Denmark via a mailed cookie tin. Wife of the victim played by Caroline Goodall (""Schindler's List"").  A man suffocates by industrial cling-wrap, 2 bros die by carving fork. See Nicholas Jones of ""Little Dorrit"" die. In the 100th a new Barnaby is born. Boy? Girl? Lbs? Name? I'll not tell.

6761652,5,B00OU4MP0K,"I wouldn't have given any odds on being able to replace an entire cast in a popular tv series and still have it be any good. But apparently in the UK they have excellent actors falling off trees because without missing a beat these two new detectives do just fine. This isn't the first season for the Barnaby cousin who took over from the original Barnaby. He had already established himself with his wonderful dog and wife. This season he got a new detective who picked right up just as smoothly. The premise remains the same: take a sleepy beautiful English village with all staid and proper villagers and unleash the wildest mayhem with murder among them. It is the contrast that makes it work and, of course, the humor. These are people for whom murder might be said to be ""bad form"" but that doesn't stop them in the slightest. I too hope this wasn't the last series but they have kept it going despite ferocious odds of its blowing up on them with all of these cast changes. It's been grand while it has lasted if this is it.",1421020800,5,1031,4.403141361256544
6761653,5,B00OU4MP0K,"""The Killings of Copenhagen"" is the 100th Episode of a great mystery series, and the last story in Set 25. For this special event, the episode takes us back to Badger's Drift, the village which hosted the very first Midsomer Murder, in both the TV series (1997) and Caroline Graham's first Inspector Barnaby mystery novel (1987).

Just before the start of this Set 25, Sergeant Benjamin Jones (played by Jason Hughes), who has been at Barnaby's side from 2005 to 2013, was promoted to Detective Inspector. It's nobody's fault but Barnaby's, because he recommended the promotion. But as Jones has left Midsomer for Brighton, Barnaby needs a new sergeant. This Set (which corresponds to the English Series 16) introduces DS Charlie Nelson. Young, active, and a city-boy who has to be introduced to village ways.

I think Gwilym Lee does a good job stepping in as the new sergeant. He isn't Jones, he doesn't try to be - he is someone new. If you've been a faithful follower of ""Midsomer Murders"" since the beginning (1997), you've had to get used to other changes. When Sergeant Troy (played by Daniel Casey) left in 2003, it felt very odd without him. When John Nettles retired as Tom Barnaby in 2011, I wasn't sure the show would survive. But in a stroke of genius, they didn't try to replace the actor playing Tom Barnaby, they brought in another actor as his cousin, John Barnaby. I love Neil Dudgeon in the series. After all, it's really the mysteries that keep me coming back to Midsomer.

A subplot of this series is the upcoming birth of the Barnaby's first child, including the travails of assembling a baby crib and the sympathetic yearnings of their doggy.

This 3-disc DVD or BluRay set has 7.7 hours of excellent mystery viewing. Because each show is 92 minutes long, there is time to tell a good story. The show is presented in 16:9 widescreen. English subtitles are available.

[Edited to Add] In England, these 5 episodes make up Series 16, in a Region 2 DVD release. This series called Set 25 only in Region 1. For the first time, though, Acorn is REISSUING this set for Region 1 with the Series 16 label. amazon has a page for the reissue:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Series-16/dp/B00XDBMA4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Series 16</a>.

...1. ""The Christmas Haunting"" (2013 Christmas Special) The village of Morton Shallows has one claim to fame, which it proudly displays on the town sign: ""Most Haunted Village in England 2003"". But that's old news now, and there are some in town who desperately desire the tourist dollars that re-winning the Most Haunted award would bring in. So, in addition to ghost tours given by The Blacksmith Arms, the Manor House is having its first ""Fright Night"" tonight. The Manor ghost tour is lead by Pippa, who also happens to live in the Manor House with her parents. Participants are fitted out with recorders and other ghost-hunting accoutrements. and Pippa tells them: ""Spread out and use your equipment. We're looking for orbs, cold spots, knockings. And if we're lucky, the ghost of the blacksmith's daughter will appear.""
All lights are turned off, but before the tourists can even settle into their places, one giggling couple make a little detour into a child's bedroom for a little smooching. Which ends with one of them being attacked in the dark, pierced through with an antique sword. Well, what did they expect. Don't they watch any scary movies? They should have known the danger the moment they entered the dark room and saw the line of glass-eyed dolls looking spooky in the moonlight streaming through the windows.
...2. ""Let Us Prey"" Reverend Martha Hilcott has a problem. Her parish church, in Midsomer St. Claire, has a newly discovered medieval fresco in its crypt which could put her church on the map. But it's the rainy season and the nearby river is threatening to wash away her treasure. For people into medieval religious iconography, loss of the full-wall fresco of the haloed Jesus overseeing the punishments of the sinners would be tragic.
That's not really in Barnaby's bailiwick. But what does catch his attention is when a body is found at a weir on the swollen river. It is a woman with her head bound in a burlap sack. Drowned just like one of the sinners in the fresco. It gets even worse when a 2nd person is killed in another manner found in the fresco. Since the fresco shows a lot of sinners dying in imaginative ways, the serial killer has to be found quickly.

...3. ""Wild Harvest"" For a posh dinner, you can go to Wyvern House, set in the picturesque Midsomer country side. You could even see the next door neighbor, the farmer Martin Strickland slouch into the restaurant dining room, tracking with his workboots and leading his hound, and insolently ask for truffles. Before you discover what that was all about, you see Martin Strickland again the next morning. He had been tied to a tree and his stomach smeared with truffle oil. A wild boar ate his torso - while he was still alive. As he appears to have made five or six people angry, Barnaby has a surfeit of suspects.
...It seems 2014 was a good year for death by pig. It is also used in Season 2 of ""Father Brown"". As I wrote in my review of that DVD, I couldn't take it seriously at first. Then I googled ""pigs eat human"" and found newstories about it. It was even used in 2013 as a method of mob execution in Italy.

...4. ""The Flying Club"" It's the dead of night at the privately owned Finchmere Airport. One of the owners is working late in the control tower when he sees the cockpit light go on in his personal plane. He heads out to investigate (while at home you're saying, ""Don't go, Don't go"") and is rewarded for his curiosity by being hit on the head with a wrench. Then he's taken up in his own plane and his unconscious body rolled out over a lake.
When Barnaby investigates the next day, he notes two curious points. The wrench was not washed or hidden and the body wasn't weighted. So what was the message of the killing and who was the message for?

...5. ""The Killings of Copenhagen"" (100th Episode of ""Midsomer Murders"") Eric Calder arrives in Copenhagen for a business meeting. When he checks into his hotel, he is surprised that there is a package waiting for him. He opens it to find an empty tin of his own biscuits. The tin reads, ""Calder's Golden Clusters"" and ""Greetings From Badger's Drift"". This sent a thrill up my spine immediately, as I recognized it as the locale of the very first Inspector Barnaby murder. Sure enough, murder is afoot, because the tin is covered in strychnine and Calder dies an agonizing death.
Barnaby and Nelson work with the Danish police to solve the crime. Not only was Calder a British citizen killed in Denmark, but the box containing the tin was franked from England. Not just England, but from the mail department in the Calder factory in Badger's Drift.
This episode is a perfect example of ""Midsomer Murders"" best - a mystery full of red herrings and psychological dynamics. It has fantastic secondary characters (which again, hearken back to the very first episode) in the form of Atticus and Ernest Bradley, smarmy and creepy.
It also is about children and parents; hopeful beginnings such as with the Barnaby's, messed up relationships, and finally redemptive 2nd chances.
Special Features
...c. ""Gwilym Lee Interview"" (9 minutes) Gwilym sits for an interview on location. One of his comments: ""I think Barnaby misses Jones.... And [I'm] this little upstart comes from the city.""
...d. ""Behind the Scenes"" (23 minutes) Commentators include Alex Pillai (director ""The Killings of Copenhagen""), Neil Dudgeon (in his ""bad"" Christmas sweater), Gwilym Lee, Birgitte Hjort Sorenson (plays Danish DS Degn) and Ann Eleonora Jorgensen (plays Danish DCI Poulsen), plus little bursts of interviews with other actors on sets/locations.
Dudgeon manages a straight face as he says, ""[Gwilym] is young and tall and thin and handsome. Apart from that I quite like him.""
Pillai notes that with 100 episodes, Midsomer County has had over 300 murders.
...e. ""Celebrating 100 Episodes"" (17 minutes) For the 100th episode, they wanted to do something special. That turned out to be the show leaving England for the first time. Denmark was a good place to go, because ""Midsome Murders"" is very popular there, and Denmark has its own crime shows that are popularly shown in England.

6761654,5,B00OU4MP0K,I watched all five episodes of season 16 on line and they are just as good as any episodes of the previous 15 seasons. As usual there are great characters and outstanding guest stars. Midsomer County is one place I could live. On a side note Season 17 started filming this past April and I believe the ITV will start airing in January.,1419465600,3,335,4.333333333333333
6761655,5,B00OU4MP0K,"The new DCI Barnaby continues to develop in this fine series. Barnaby's new Sergeant, Nelson, is an excellent addition. The relationship between Barnaby and his wife and dog is also on display here. All in all, a worthy continuation of one of the finest series ever on television. If you liked it before, you'll continue to like it here. One reviewer says this is supposed to be the last series. I certainly hope not! As long as Midsomer has people left to be murdered, I want to keep watching.",1419465600,65,494,4.561797752808989

6761658,5,B00OU4MP0K,"This is top-notch Midsomer, clever, quirky, odd, and FUN! England: that blessed plot, rife with delightful dogs and detectives. In Midsomer's deceptively bucolic hills and dales, this is the offbeat, alternative universe fans crave. Gwilym Lee (great in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-Girls/dp/B009B8YZMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land Girls</a>) joins the team, as DS Charlie Nelson. He and our DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) are a wonderful team. The U.K. boasts numerous fine (and underrated) actors. DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) has left; he may be a guest in future specials, but  supplies Barnaby a letter in the first story...

And Sykes is in rare form! So is DCI John Barnaby lovely wife Sarah (the lovely Fiona Dolman), pregnant with ""Bump Barnaby."" A synopsis of the delicious episodes in this collection. Happily, there will be future stories to come. Enjoy!

""The Christmas Haunting,"" written by Chris Murray. This is great stuff! DCI Barnaby and DS Nelson investigate a murder that occurs during a ghost-hunting party at a haunted estate. The toys are indeed scary! A guest is stabbed with an antique sword. There is a legend involving a vengeful spirit, a blacksmith's daughter, whilst Barnaby and Nelson unravel earth-bound motives to find the killer. This is the first appearance of Gwilym Lee as DS Charlie Nelson - a fine addition to a great cast! Try a mug of ""Causton Special Ale"" in the pub...

""Let Us Prey,"" written by Paul Logue. Wonderful guest stars add to another fine story. In soggy Midsomer St Clair, a woman is found drowned in a river with a mask on her head. It turns out that an ancient paining had been unearthed under the church vaults, resulting in all kinds of classic Midsomer havoc. Rain continues to flood the area, mindful of ""The Nine Tailors"" by the great Dorothy L. Sayers.

""Wild Harvest,"" written by the great team of Rachel Cuperman and Sally Griffiths. A great addition to the macabre oeuvre of Midsomer! An herbalist finds the unfortunate farmer Martin Strickland tied to a tree, covered in truffle oil, and subsequently mauled to death by one of Midsomer's roaming wild boars. A macabre murder fit for the classic series - right up there with death by trebuchet-launched wine. This being Midsomer, the body-count rises, and complex knots of tormented relationships must be unraveled by our intrepid duo.

""The Flying Club,"" by Michael Aitkens. When the owner of Finchmere Airfield is dropped from a plane to meet a gruesome death, Barnaby and Nelson find the exciting world of stunt pilots and military heroes hides many dark secrets. It's a puzzle whether anti-airport campaigners are behind Bernard King's murder, or if it links back to a tragic World War Two mission. The wonderful Bernie Gribbens (Doctor Who) guest stars.

""The Killings of Copenhagen,"" written by Paul Logue
Yay, we're back in Badger's Drift! A standout! An especially excellent feature, which is a treat since this is the 100th episode. While on a business trip to Copenhagen, the boss of Calder's Biscuits is killed when he opens a poisoned tin of his famous Golden Clusters, sent from Badger's Drift. Danish detectives (quite funny in their comments on English detectives) require the assistance of Barnaby and Nelson. Denmark is Midsomerized beautifully; the Danish cast is superb. There is a great scene inside Calder's Biscuits with the baker- maestro, a la Willie Wonka. Of course, more bodies are found, murdered in inimitable Midsomer style. Be sure to have plenty of and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carr-s-Ginger-Lemon-Creme-Cookies/dp/B0018QLG9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carr's Ginger Lemon Creme Cookies</a>&nbsp;on hand. Sykes is superb throughout, and we finally get to meet the newest addition to the Midsomer family. Enjoy!

The Bonus Extras are a lot of fun, with New Blood: a charming interview with Gwilym Lee, a jovial behind-the -scenes romp, and another: Celebrating 100 Episodes.
