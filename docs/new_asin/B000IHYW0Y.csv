8146003,5,B000IHYW0Y,This product is an excellent one to invest in if your trying to get fit. I get it two thumbs up. Mr. Blanks is the King of excercise. Everyone models themselves after him in the excercise world.,1325808000,,194,4.27027027027027
8146004,4,B000IHYW0Y,"I own a variety of workout videos.  I like to pop this one in when I want something simple to follow as far as the steps...but fast paced.  I am not coordinated enough to follow much more than kick, jab, knee....when there is too much going on I stumble all over the place and am embarrassed even in the privacy of my own home.  The people are kind smiley and yes it's slightly corny but so much fun none the less.  The thing I like about Billy Blanks is he has great energy and can motivate.  The workout has such a good rhythm to it b/c it's 8 counts every time so it's easy to keep the pace of the people working out.  It's challenging enough to work up a good sweat but not overkill.  I used this one to help me get ready to do the Insanity workout for about two months.  I the mean time I saw good results and noticed significant firming of my thighs and core.  You don't HAVE to get the Billy bands but I reccomend them.  I used light weights b/c I was too cheap to buy them but I think I missed out on better toning by not using them.  I also like how Billy Blanks speaks to new mothers and women in general...I know it's silly but he made himself so much more endearing to me for that.  awwwwww[...]",1315440000,3,1207,4.046413502109704
8146005,5,B000IHYW0Y,"I purchased this originally as part of a a 4-DVD set that came with Billy Bands, although the workout doesn't have to be done with the bands. Overall, it is a great workout, as you really do work up a sweat. If you want to read my in-depth review, please check out my blog post at [...].",1298851200,,287,4.052631578947368
8146006,4,B000IHYW0Y,"I have since moved on to Billy's Ultimate Taebo, but now have my boys (11 & 15) doing this DVD 3 times per week. The movements are simple to learn, and in this DVD Billy takes the time to let the home exerciser learn each movement before increasing the speed of the movement. My kids realize that this is based off of kickboxing, and so they're enjoying it.",1298505600,2,357,4.264705882352941
8146007,5,B000IHYW0Y,"As the title says, I'm just getting started. I did my first workout last night and did I sweat like crazy. I got through about 20 minutes and didn't want to overdo it (I have asthma). I really enjoyed the DVD and look forward to the day I can complete the entire workout.",1176768000,6,271,4.132075471698113
8146008,5,B000IHYW0Y,"As my title says, this is a good exercise dvd for beginners. Don't worry about using the billy bands because if you're new then those will just be way too much of a challege for you. If you want, you can buy light weights and use those. Take it step by step and in no time will you be able to complete this dvd and you'll start seeing changes in your body within a few weeks. This isn't one of those intense workouts you used to see on the infomercials in the late 90s, this is for beginners.",1168041600,19,492,4.030612244897959
8146009,5,B000IHYW0Y,"I have been doing tae-bo for about 9 months now so when I found this new series I was thrilled.  After doing the mission one, getting started, I realized I had found another winner.  It is so fun that you want to do more.  You will sweat and feel totally worked, but it feels more like fun than a workout.  I recommend this to all who want to get in/stay in shape and have a good time.",1150934400,,385,3.961038961038961
