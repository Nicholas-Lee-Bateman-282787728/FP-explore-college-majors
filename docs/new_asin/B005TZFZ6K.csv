4893144,5,B005TZFZ6K,"Este especial estuvo muy bonito y ameno. Hace un tiempo atras dije por estos medios que el tiempo fue menos de una hora pero, solo critique eso y no me percate que fue porque solo vi el especial por television. Hoy me retracto y pido disculpas por lo dicho anteriormente. El DVD tiene un total de 80 mins con entrevistas y extras que no salen en TV. Tremendo especial del Banco Popular de Puerto Rico y bien merecido homenaje postumo a quien fue quizas el mejor autor musical no solo de Puerto Rico, si no que del Caribe entero. Una vez mas, el Banco Popular de Puerto Rico bota la casa por la ventana, como dice el dicho. Recomiendo este DVD altamente y en grado superlativo!",1323820800,9,676,4.373015873015873
4893145,5,B005TZFZ6K,This program was aired by Telemundo on 12/4/2011 & it was wonderful. The music & the vintage clips of musicians were beautiful. The program was surprisingly moving & made me want to dance!!  Highly recommended.,1322956800,6,210,5.0

4893169,4,B005TZFZ6K,"Those first Christmas specials were absolutely amazing, I'm so sad that I did not buy them and now they are like collectibles. Then the quality started dropping and I lost the interest. But with this special I think they are going back to the beginning, great stories, great music, great interviews.",1365379200,,299,4.882352941176471

4893171,5,B005TZFZ6K,"This is a nice film with musical numbers taking place in public places such as the streets of Puerto Rico, New York, etc. ""Con los pobres estoy"" is definitely a fantastic number. My guess is that a lot of the songs were dubbed with studio versions, probably not an easy thing to do.",1331251200,,282,4.339622641509434
4893172,1,B005TZFZ6K,"I'm really disappointed i thought i was buying a NEW dvd but instead i got a boot leg copy. To make matters worse the dvd won't play in my DVD player only on my computer. Don't get me wrong the documentary of tite curet is great but i was expecting an original copy, i could have gotten a boot leg on my own. Be careful when purchasing this item.",1330473600,,346,4.028985507246377
4893173,5,B005TZFZ6K,We were pleasantly surprised when we received this CD.  We are going to share it with our grandchildren when they come to visit. There will be lots of dancing going on. This CD is very well done.,1329264000,,195,4.27027027027027
4893174,5,B005TZFZ6K,This DVD contains a piece of history that many hispanics from the caribbean will come to adore when they see this video. The story of El Maestro Tite is awesome. The way in which it was presented and the legacy of titles that he gave to our salsa singers throught the times was unbridaled and beautiful. El Maestro had a knack for writing in a way that matched each of the interpreters that sang his music. his approach to music creation and his knowledge was unmatched. Excellent DVD and just sorry that it could not be any longer. there was plenty of material to create hours and hours of DVD's.,1327795200,2,597,4.4363636363636365
4893175,5,B005TZFZ6K,"Definately this DvD is on my HIT list I enjoyed the gritty feel to it ,it was strait up in the street & in the Barrios , not clean cut like other Popular Specials was a good change the only thing I actually had an issue with was Calle 13 & thier song just did not like it , what can I say Im not a calle 13 fan they low ghetto in my book but I understand they got a large fan base para cada cual but Popular would of did better putting on Juana Bayona they through a small sample  on the extras but i guess ill have to get it else where,  Trina Medinas song Lamento de Concepcion was hot she tore it up ,got some justice from Venezuela, Tego , Ruben Blades & who can forget Cheo Feliciano & the rest of the songs were on point felicidades!",1325548800,,739,3.8552631578947367
