277416,5,6300247163,"Combining soapy suds and exhilarating dance sequences with the formidable  acting skills of lead players Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft, Herbert  Ross creates a winner in The Turning Point.  Baryshnikov is every bit as  magnetic onscreen, in a well-chosen role as a dance lothario, as he is  every second he is dancing; he defies gravity and sends your spirit  soaring.  Leslie Browne, a novice (to put it kindly), in the acting  department, is no less spectacular on the dance floor.  Rarely has a big,  old-fashioned, commercial film been so successful at making classical  ballet so tangible and electric.  The score, punctuacted throughout with  the obvious classical scores of the many pieces we get glimpses of, adds a  resonance to the story.  MacLaine and Bancroft, as rivals in romance and  once, in their careers, have a grand old time with our emotions, as they  traverse the entire wide range of jealousy, humiliation, aging, love,  friendship -- and eventually combust onscreen, which provides the movie  with its most dazzlingly entertaining moments of drama.  Tom Skerrit is  terrific as Shirley's dancer-gone-husband, and the portrait of MacLaine's  character has surprising moments of reality sprinkled throughout the  screenplay.  A wonderful big, overlong, old-fashioned movie, and a great  way to introduce your family to classic dance, not only painlessly, but  engagingly.",962323200,52,1398,5.386046511627907

277499,5,6300247163,"This is the best movie about bellet dancers in terms of superior acting and I was literally blown away by  Anne Bancroft and Shirley Mclanine's masperpiece acting!
They were goddess in this movie.
No flaw at all. Just pure perfecto.
The moments like when they are fighting over the fact that Shirley gave up dancing because of her daughter and Anne continued and went all the way to the top and she said it was not. You gave up because you touched the limit and you just found an excuse that is you've got a baby.
They were fighting like crazy and ended up with laughing and became back to old time friends. The acting was so so perfectly pure and natural I was shouting OSCAR+ CANNE and beyond all the acting award just damn give it to both of them for christ sake!

The dancing sequences are just pure class masterpice elegant makes you eye pop feel like you are in the A + 1000$ seat of the bellet  theater watching the dancing performance.
You are just blessed watching this film without any interruption at home.

Along with them is the great Mikhail Baryshnikov you've seen him from <WHITE NIGHTS> a great dancer himself but also acted for a few movies too.

Also the rising dancer part was the pretty elegant actress Leslie Browne worked very well for the roll made us even more enjoy the movie.

If you liked films like <BLACK SWAN><RED SHOES> and other classic ballet movies this is something that you shouldn't miss at all.
The music, the dancing the acting of two great great actresses never forgotten forever for the part they did for this film.

The fine directorial part done by Hubar Ross who've never made any decent film in his career but just this one shined like never been before.
He should be remembered forever.

Also it was blessed that the movie was restored in stereo knowing the fact that it was shot back in 1977.

The version you can get in dvd is Korean and the Bluray is not playable in the US since it is European B code that I can play since mine is code free but you need a code free bluray player which is expensive about 250-350$ but worth bying since UK sells thousands of blurays like dumping them in 2-5$ per bluray.
Once you buy the player you have unlimited access to any bluray from any country.

Again this is the movie you shouldn't miss.",1471737600,,2281,4.422434367541766

277502,5,6300247163,This a terrific movie if you like some gorgeous ballet sequences throughout a drama about how our life choices when we are young affect the rest of our lives. Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine give really great performances as two middle age woman that decided to make very different choices about their careers in ballet when young. Still best friends they have many resentments towards each other and regrets within themselves. MacLaine marries another ballet dancer played by Tom Skerrit and has three children. They have a dance studio which fulfills Skerrit's life dreams but leaves MacLaine upset that she did not choose the path that Bancroft did as a prima ballerina who has known fame and fortune but lacks real love in her life. MacLaine's oldest daughter is a dancer with the talent to be in the limelight. I liked how they show her dancing and at the same time exploring love too. There is some real fireworks set off by the main characters involved. It is beautifully acted and directed. If you love a mix of dance and drama you will be pleased by this moving film.,1465430400,7,1079,4.714285714285714

277825,5,6300247163,"Combine Anne Bancroft, Shirley MacLaine, Tom Skerritt, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Leslie Browne and Martha Scott...throw in the Corps de Ballet of any reputable company plus the aging ballerina, Alexandra Danilova, as well as the famed apartments above the stage at Carnegie Hall and you have a very believable and entertaining film about transitioning from ballet to ballet to even more ballet.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the treatment given the character of Emma, beautifully acted by Anne Bancroft, was not one which elicited moanful oh nooooo's! As a non-dancer, they depicted her perfectly and yet, her positioning, arm and hand movements were spot on.  Even Shirley MacLaine, who is a dancer by trade, was not depicted as an aging ballerina in anything but dialog.  Anne Bancroft cuts a delicate and elegant figure from any vantage point and is one of the most versatile actresses ever to grace the screen.  Her preparation and understanding of the dance is evident in her actions and reactions.  We don't often get to see the back stage machinations or personal interactions of any company, let alone from the world of ballet so this was a special treat for all comers! Within the context are snippets of dance sequences that are a delight for anyone who loves the excitement of dance. Leslie Browne delivers a fine performance as, Emilia, Dee Dee's daughter who happens to be Emma's Godchild and who will be the next prima ballerina. Mikhail Baryshnikov is splendid as, Yuri, the handsome Russian lover of the company who knows everyone intimately and dances superlatively. He is always exciting to watch, even when not in tights!  The story is one of past, present and future and as two aging ballerinas come to grips with their places within and outside the company for whom they both danced...the next generation is poised and waiting in the wings as even those behind them are crashing the entry doors to the practice floors and careers of a lifetime. This is a story of desire, commitment, missed opportunities, recriminations, self doubt, acceptance, dreams and successes realized and yet, overall, this is a story of hope even as the torch is passed. This is a film I have watched over and over again through the years and is always a first choice for re-viewing one of the great films of the era.",1402704000,4,2314,4.90537084398977

One thing that's very puzzling: This is an American made movie by 20th Century Fox Corp.  Why is it currently being made only to play only as a Region 2 DVD movie -only fit for European DVD players?  I had to purchase a Region 2 (European) DVD player just to be able to watch this American made film?!  Why is there such censorship in America that Americans cannot watch European movies on (our Region 1) DVD players, but ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD CAN WATCH REGION 1 MOVIES -AMERICAN.

277946,4,6300247163,"""The Turning Point"" concerns best friends Emma and Dee Dee. They met as young women in a dance company in New York. Emma became a prima ballerina but has no family and a boyfriend who's married to someone else. Dee Dee married another member of the dance company, got pregnant, and moved to Oklahoma City where she and her devoted husband run a ballet school and are raising three children. Dee Dee returns to New York for a summer with her elder daughter and son so they can study with the American Ballet Company while her husband remains in Oklahoma City with the middle child. The movie explores jealousy, resentment, and the choices we make at our ""turning points."" Well-written and gorgeously-acted by Anne Bancroft as Emma and Shirley MacLaine as Dee Dee, the plot is nonetheless pretty standard soap opera fare.

Mikhail Baryshnikov played his first role in this film and it's easy to see why he has enjoyed such popularity. He out-charms and out-shines everybody not only in this movie but in just about any movie. Had they been contemporaries and Baryshnikov elected to put more effort into building an acting career, Cary Grant would have needed to watch his back--seriously. And he's a freaking amazing dancer. Maybe he's just playing himself, but he's wonderful as the Russian emigre dancer who seduces Dee Dee's eldest daughter Emilia. Sadly, Leslie Browne, a gifted dancer who plays Emilia, is WAY out of her league in the acting chops department. She seems like zombie rather than a character, and I could not shake the feeling that her line readings had been dubbed, limply, by someone else. I see why the other performers (Bancroft, MacLaine and Baryshnikov) got their Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor nominations, but I cannot begin to fathom why Browne was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this insipid sleepwalking.

The dance sequences are the real reason to watch ""The Turning Point."" They are flat-out beautiful, even if you're not a big ballet aficionado, and ""The Turning Point"" doles them out generously. If I were to watch this again, I would fast-forward through any non-dance scene that did not have Baryshnikov and just watch the dances and listen to the beautiful music accompanying them over and over.",1369612800,2,2249,4.931398416886544

It made ballet cool in movies again( and even allowed director Herbert Ross to follow it up with another film, Nijinsky, based on the life of the famous ballet star), featured a top-flight cast and beautifully staged ballet set-pieces in a compelling story.

I'd just like to point out that the cinematography in the film by Robert Surtees is also exceptional and should be a great selling point in getting a new transfer and video release. I saw this film several times on the big screen in '77 and every frame really just glows(watch Leslie Browne's solo over the end titles and see if you don't agree). Traditional video releases didn't do it justice at the time; A new BluRay 4k transfer would look spectacular on any HD screen today.

The Turning Point is a true Prestige film. I would hope that *someone* at 20th Century Fox realizes the value of this film's history and will someday give us the hi-res showcase edition it deserves.",1354579200,2,1064,4.684491978609626

Deedee always wondered if settling down was the right decision and now that her daughter is a ballerina, the old doubts flood back.

If you love ballet, this is the movie for you and if you don't love it, maybe you will after watching it.  The dance scenes are simply magnificent; Leslie Browne, who plays Deedee's daughter, is a lovely dancer (though not a strong actress) and she is paired with the stunning Mikhail Baryshnikov who is charisma personified.  MacLaine and Bancroft are old pros and play well off each other.  The regal Bancroft doesn't actually dance but looks like a dancer and always owns the screen.  MacLaine's character is whiny and at first doesn't appreciate how good her life is.  The two ladies are well-matched and fun to watch; all four lead actors received Oscar nods (and the movie was nominated 11 times in total).

Bad idea not to include sub titles.

278065,2,6300247163,"I don't know if you can label this a `sports movie', but for the sake of my argument I'm going to.  I mean, technically ballet is sort of a sport, right?  Well, I guess not, but whatever.  It'll have to be considered one for the time being.  Okay, so my argument is this.  Sometimes there are `sports movies' that can be enjoyed by any and everyone, regardless of your feelings on the sport itself.  Other films rely on your personal appreciation of the sport to fuel your love for the movie.  I happen to enjoy a good sports movie, when it's done right, but personally I'm not a sports kind of guy, and so the film has to work extra hard to grab my attention.  The film has to be able to make me care about something I'm not too interested in.  When I think of films like `Friday Night Lights' I get all warm inside, because while my interest in football is minimal, that film made me care about the game and the players.  When a film fails to give you a personal reason to connect to the story then you find yourself uninterested and unmotivated.

`The Turning Point' is that kind of movie for me.  It is really only enjoyable (in my opinion) for someone who is in love with the sport (the dance, the profession, the art...whatever you want to call it).  I found myself almost bored stiff throughout large portions of this film, and so I have to conclude that the only way to appreciate this movie is to love ballet as much as it does.

I've seen other dance films and absolutely loved them, so this isn't just a genre thing, believe me.

The film casts Shirley MacLaine (love her) and Anne Bancroft as old friends who become reunited one's daughter joins a ballet company the other belongs to.  Deedee Rogers and Emma Jacklin grew up dancing together, but when Deedee got pregnant she gave up her career to start a family.  Years later Deedee's daughter Emilia joins the same ballet company Emma belongs to and the two friends become locked in a subtle yet powerful war for the soul of Emilia so-to-speak.  While they struggle to hold on the Emilia they also struggle with their affections for one another.  They both have what the other wants so desperately and so their love is bittersweet.

The acting is very good from both Bancroft and MacLaine, but elsewhere it is lacking.  MacLaine is sublime as the conflicted mother, giving her character so many emotional layers; while Bancroft simmers as Emma, keeping her guard up so as to maintain her pleasant faade.  The two actresses give performances that are far and away superior to the film they happen to star in.  I was not impressed with much else.  I felt that the dancing, while beautiful, was too prominent (especially in the end) and took away from the `film'.  The gritty style in which the film was shot is also a slight deterrence, for it doesn't match the films tone at all.  I thought that Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne deliver decent yet very rudimentary performances, neither shining bright enough to deserve the Oscar nominations they received.

In fact, how this movie was nominated for anything aside from MacLaine (very deserved) and Bancroft (also excellent) is beyond me, yet it managed to rack up ELEVEN nominations.  Well, I guess people really liked this movie, but it the flimsy script (there is not enough depth here, really) and the poor pacing make this a film I'm not too keen on at all.",1241136000,,3380,4.560530679933665

278072,4,6300247163,"I remember the ""ballet boom"" of the 70s, and since I was lucky enough to live in NYC, I often saw ABT and NYCB performances. I saw Leslie Browne and Mikhail Baryshnikov perform fairly often (as well as Gelsey Kirkland, who, the story goes, was first choice for the role Leslie Browne eventually got), and I even got to see a class taught by Alexandra Danilova at the School of American Ballet; that was a thrill for me. Those were exciting times for dance, and for balletomanes like me.

That being said, The Turning Point is only coindentally a film about dance. It's more a ""woman's film"" about how in later life we realize what we gave up when we made important choices, and sometimes we have regrets. This should not be news to anyone. The good news is that we see Bancroft and MacLaine, who would be worth watching no matter what. The limber Leslie Browne, then a soloist at ABT who was also the goddaughter of either Herbert Ross or his wife (forgive me, it was a long time ago) is eminently watchable in the dance scenes, but she is not a good actress. (Years later I saw her in the film ""Dancers"" and she was very, very good in a nondance role.)

The big gala at the end is a montage of clips showing dancers in different pas de deux - various gala warhorses. It looks almost like stock footage. But the scene in which Emily performs to ""Ellingtonia"" (it's actually a piece lifted whole from Alvin Ailey's wonderful ballet ""The River"", which was part of ABT's repertory in those years) is worth seeing; both she and the choreography are smashing. And of course there is the almost-obligatory coda from the Don Q wedding pas de deux, which is spoiled in part by the camera's close-ups of Browne's feet while she's doing turns. Yes, we know ballerinas have feet, and ballet fans know what pointework looks like; but when a dance performance is filmed, the dancer's entire body should be in the frame.

The gala stuff is worth seeing if you never knew who these dancers were, or you did and you miss them. One of my favorite dances there is the one with Peter Martins (I think) and Suzanne Farrell; those two were awesome together.

And there's the sequence between Browne and Baryshnikov set to Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet, set in a vast imaginary loft. I want to groan ""Oh, brother"", but the truth is, that scene gets me every time. Browne never looked better than she does in that performance.

Danilova herself appears in the film, and I just love her.",1203120000,4,2462,4.511210762331839

It simply isn't the dated embarrassment that so many 1970s ""classics"" have become.

This is partially because of its untraditional story arc and cast of characters. This film has THREE female leads, yet it hails from an era when you were lucky to get even one. And THE TURNING POINT is also a good reminder of what terrific actresses Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine were. (Though MacLaine should get a lifetime achievement award for bad eye make-up.) And dancer Emilia Rodgers, who plays Shirley's daughter, is well cast in her role as an inscrutable and precocious young woman.

278172,5,6300247163,"The Turning Point was by far the best picture of 1977.  It brought together two great actresses whose careers were in limbo and revitalized them.

Deedee (Shirley Maclaine) and Emma (Anne Bancroft) were best friends.  Both were up and coming stars of the American Ballet Company.  Both were vying for the same role, the new ballet of Anna Karenina (Turning Point #1).  But Deedee gets pregnant and has to decide if she will keep the baby (Turning Point #2).  Deedee decides to have the baby and Emma gets the ballet.

It's 20 years later and the ABC is performing in Oklahoma City, where Deedee and Wayne (Tom Skerritt) have settled down and opened their own ballet school.  Two of their children are dancers but the middle child wants nothing to do with it.  Deedee and Wayne hold a party after the performance.  Their oldest, Amelia (Leslie Browne), is drawn to the fading prima ballerina who invites her to take class with the company the next morning.

During the practice, Emma points out Amelia to the head of the company (Martha Scott) and she sees the talent plus the publicity value.  Amelia is offered a place in the company.  Emma is honored by the offer but is a little afraid at being taken away from family (Turning Point #3).  To help her along, Deedee offers to spend the summer with her in NYC.  Deedee, Amelia and her brother all head off to the Big Apple.

Amelia easily fits into the company and the managers take notice of her.  She quickly gets a \the lead in a major new ballet.  She also catches the eye of the hot new star, Yuri (Mikhail Baryshnikov).  They start a relationship but the difference is she wants more and he wants to play the field.

Deedee quickly finds out that the only thing worse than a fading star is a never was.  So she when she runs into a friend from the old days (Anthony Zerbe), she starts spending time with him.  Amelia feels, a little too much time with him.

Emma has to come to grips with his fading star and latches onto Amelia.  But Deedee is on to her immediately.  This is comes to a head at after the Opening Gala.  The confrontation at the reception bar has become legendary followed by an even more celebrated cat fight in front of the theatre.

Wayne arrives and as always centers the family.  But as this is a time for turning points, Deedee decides to confront some of her and Wayne's demons. This is another great scene for Maclaine.

All ties up nicely with the premier of the ballet that stars Amelia.  This brings Deedee and Emma back together with their differences settled.

This film restarted Shirley Maclaine's career and this performance should have garnered her first Oscar for this but Anne Bancroft's strong performance (along with Jane Fonda) split the vote and she would have to wait until Terms of Endearment to get her recognition.

This was the film gave Tom Skerrit his first break. Leslie Browne followed her movie mother's career as she stepped into her role after the original cast in her role had to bow out.  Ms. Browne received an Oscar nomination along with her love interest in the film Mikhail Baryshnikov.

The film was written by Arthur Laurents who gave us West Side Story and The Way We Were and was directed by Herbert Ross who got his start on the Streisand films Funny Girl and Funny Lady.

Wayne arrives in New York wearing a leisure suit and floral shirt that Billy Carter would have wrestled him to the ground for. This soap opera finally runs totally amuck when Bancroft and MacLaine engage in one of the strangest cat fights ever filmed.

Although the movie is not nearly as good as I remembered, the acting and the ballet sequences with the fine music of course ultimately make this movie worth watching. Bancroft and MacLaine, two of the finest actresses of their generation, can do anything where acting is involved. The dancing by both Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne will take your breath away.",1146268800,6,1369,4.7238493723849375

I think I watched it over 300 times in my life, which is probably why I am a dance major. ANYWAYS, this movie can be watched by anyone. Everything about this movie makes its amazing. You get to see Baryshnikov in his prime, which many of us young dancers never got to view, and you get to see some amazing actress's in action. The whole plot behind the movie is something many dancers to this day are faced with. The question is, to leave dance to start a family and have a ""normal"" life, or to stay in dance forever....never expierencing a family but always be idolized for the achievments you have made. It shows both sides of the spectrum as well as some amazing dance scene's.

278179,5,6300247163,"Fabulous that they have finally found a DVD home for this, one of my favorite movies ever.  Back in 1977, I was a kid of 17 and quite ""different"" from my peers.  Being bored by Star Wars (all that noise and awful John Williams music giving me a headache!), and much more enchanted by three other movies released that same year: New York, New York, Julia, and The Turning Point.  As you can see, I had quite a lot in common with other boys my age!  I can remember as if it were yesterday the first time I experienced The Turning Point on the big screen.  Granted, I was not, nor am I to this day, a particularly huge admirer of ballet - opera being more my style - but after seeing this flick, the combination of fine dancing, and, especially, fine film acting and script writing, just blew my mind and the lid off my head!  The late 70's was a kind of renaissance for great woman actors (and ballet too!), and scripts written for them, especially MacLaine, Fonda, and Streep.  This film was a stand out indeed.  The scenes of MacLaine in her suburban home, preparing to receive the company of her long-lost ballet friends are just so palpable and full of emotion.  Bancroft is no less compelling - gorgeous to look at (is it just me or does she not look a bit like the great Callas?), subtle in her resignation that she is no longer what she was but NOT bitter about it, the way MacLaine is quite bitter and a bit disappointed in terms of the way her life has turned out.  Her caring and admiration for MacLaine's  daughter, Leslie Brown, is never, I feel, done in a way to spite her one-time rival.  It's simply one artist acknowledging and encouraging another for the sake of their Art. The little ""inside"" bits of the ballet world also contribute considerably to this film, adding truth and a texture that, I'm afraid to say, could never be done today (the ballet world is NOT the same today as it was in the late 70's, a glowing period it was indeed!!!).  As for all the talk regarding Ms. Brown's acting ability, I think she is perfect for this role, projecting an innocent, vulnerable quality with an ability to also dance quite well.  As for Baryshnikov?  Well, what can I say.  Beautiful to look at and especially amusing in the early part of the film where he is serenading the post-performance party with a little Russian melody.

This is what film making used to be about - great acting, interesting personalities, fine script writing, and an all-around interest and knowledge of what a particular film was supposed to be about.

278220,3,6300247163,"Glad to finally see this on DVD.  Leslie Brown is pathetic as an actress and the divine Anne Bancroft is a bit melodramatic.  However, having lived through this wonderful period in ballet history, and knowing some former star ballerinas, I can relate to the drama.  This is truly a glimpse into the American Ballet Theatre when it was still great.  Of course, the artistry and excitement reflected in the film doesn't exist anymore.  Too bad!  On of Ms. Brown's worst representations in the film, (she is the God daughter of executive producer Nora Kaye, who by the way was one of the most incredibly dramatic ballerinas ever), is when she performs the thrilling solo Vortex solo from Ailey's The River.  Performed magnificently in performance by such greats as Eleanor D'Antuono, Brown is really BAD.  Another sad thing is that the amazing performance at the end of the film at the gala have not been restored and included as bonus material.  God I would have loved to see those performances in full.  Oh well, probably lost on the cutting room floor.  I do recommend this movie if you love ballet and want to see something of a time that has vanished.

The movie is a very believable examinaton of the conflicts women face and the balancing acts women must succeed at in order to be true to themselves, their mates, their children, and their careers.  The film holds up remarkably well, and as the film poster originally stated: ""The Generations Change, But The Choices Remain The Same.""

As for the DVD, it is a respectable but VERY bare bones affair.  The original preview and a featurette are included.  The featurette was made at the time of production and was mastered from a horrible Master Source (There may have been none better available!) and it features film clips and brief interviews with key people involved in the production.

The film is presented in its original widescreen format and looks to have been cleaned-up and color-corrected.  I would have liked to have had the writer, director, and principal cast do a restrospective and/or a commentary track but just getting the movie on DVD to begin with (and looking this good) is a real accomplishment.

Shirley MacLaine's performance as the dancer-turned-mother and wifie, and Ann Bancroft's role as the aging ballerina who won't let go of the past is quite realistic. Each woman is struggling with an ego that won't allow them to voice their true emotions, all fear-based and poignant. One fears that she wasn't ever good enough to become the star her friend went on to be, and hides behind motherhood and a veiled jealousy of her daughter who is definitely on her way. The other is also jealous of the life her friend has, and fears growing old and being forgotten by the dance world she loves and hates. As Shirley MacLaine's character seeks answers through infidelity and anger, Ann Bancroft takes Shirley's daughter hostage, pets and spoils her - all to feed her own self-confidence.  Frankly, I think the cat fight on the roof is a wonderful scene, because finally, the two friends are able to show her fear and anger of being forgotten and growing old, and express their desire for something they can never have, for whatever reason, to each other. Watching Mikhail leap through the air is indeed a pleasure as well; but I personally enjoy his love scenes and Leslie Brown's long arms reaching to the sky as she falls in love with him.

No one has in all, not in the ballet world, anyway, as exemplified by the ballerina determined not to wind up 'like Emma', although she seems to have achieved a fair amount of success and accomplishment in her own career by that time.

7807378,4,6300247163,"Review of ""The Turning Point""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

The Turning Point is a landmark film in the dance movie genre. It follow two former friends and ballerinas, oneShirley MacLainewho chose to have a family instead of a career, and the otherAnne Bancroftwho chose the career and is weighing the consequences of what she gave up. MacLaines daughter is also a ballerina, and as she pursues her dancing, she idolizes Bancroft rather than her own mother.

The downside of this movie is the two leads. Theres nothing wrong with their acting, and the famous catfight scene makes the entire movie worth it, but its not very believable that either of them was ever a ballerina. MacLaine was a very good dancer in her heyday, and actually knows ballet, but the movie never showcases her skills. To anyone who doesnt know her background, her stature doesnt make her training immediately apparent. Bancrofts willowy frame is showcased in the film, but in the dance world, a ballerina approaches retirement at thirty. Bancrofts age makes the audience exercise a great deal of suspension of disbelief; shes clearly in her forties and still a much-sought-after prima ballerina? Not true in the dance world.

The upside: Mikhail Baryshnikov. What a cutie pie! And while they are the minor leads of the movie, there are some beautiful dance scenes with Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne, real-life dancers. Plus, Tom Skerritt, who plays MacLaines husband, is two tons of handsome. Lots of eye candy in this one, and lots of dancing, so if that appeals to you, rent it during your next girls weekend!",1498435200,,1587,4.914179104477612
