Dewan absolutely deadpans the styles used in all the real filmstrips I was ever subjected to. No crack at all the veneer. The contents so often are completely factual on one frame and then in the next frame they veer off into complete absurdist fantasy or surreal human-heart-extraction delusion or into existential discussions of the plight of the mid-20th-century graphic artist. It requires close and careful watching. All done to the march of ""beep"" ""beep"" ""beep"" frame advancing.

This is not Firesign Theater, or Duck's Breath Mystery Theater, but a different form of absurdism, something maybe more akin to Dr Strangelove, in the way that everything must be done absolutely deadpan. The advance beeps require acceptance of one scene and preparation (anticipation, yes!) for the next. Triumphant!",1374796800,3,891,5.137931034482759
