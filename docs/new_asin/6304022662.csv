Favorite scene: Ator is hang-gliding (why??) above a castle and the movie is playing some corny Ator-flying music and one of the MST guys  starts singing a little song to go along with the action. Other memorable  scenes: Ator, muscled actor with little talent, wrestles with some  ""dangerous"" animals that are obviously poorly-made puppets. It's  a must see!",928972800,,436,4.931506849315069

It's the sequel to a knock-off of Conan the Barbarian.

757014,4,6304022662,"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a movie concept, I think it is better to look at the individual parts of the episode in order to properly grade.

The Movie: The first part of this terrible Italian Conan rip-off is a confusing disjointed mess as the opening credits and flashbacks are not even related to the main plot.  The only part I could follow is that a Freddie Mercury looking villain is trying to obtain an object from a wise man (who makes Kristen Stewart look like a speed talker).  Eventually our feather-haired hero sets out to stop the villain but gets sidetracked by about five different subplots that go nowhere.  Honestly this is a top 10 worst-movie-ever-shown-on-MST3k contender.  The movie did show some promise but it constantly switched back and forth between so-bad-it's-hilariously-funny to so-bad-it's boringly-bad.

Riffs: Joel and the bots have some very good riffs and seem to have fun but there were some moments where the riff rate was very low.  I was left feeling that the MST3k really missed some great riffing moments especially as the:

Host Segments: were hilarious!  For whatever reason, the best ripping on the movie occurs not during the riffing parts but during the host segments.  This is the first time that I can remember when the segments were more witty and more observant than the riffs.  A good example is Dr. Forrester's introduction of the movie.  I didn't realize how subtly funny and observant it was until the movie was over.

Overall: I found this episode to be very hard to grade.  You must watch this episode as the movie contains probably the best scene ever shown on MST3k with Tom Servo adding the perfectly cynical riff (I couldn't laugh as I was shocked on how awfully bad it was - in a good way!)  And yet there are parts of the movie that were so uninteresting and confusing that it felt like a chore to watch.  And for MST3k part, Joel and the bots really let some great riffing moments slip by only to redeem themselves during the host segments.  Like I said, you need to watch this but it is not a great episode.",1356566400,2,2091,4.608108108108108

757020,5,6304022662,"One of my favorite episodes. I'm defineately buying this DVD after seeing on YouTube! Along with ""Manos"", ""The Final Sacrifice"", ""Eegah!"", and a few others, this is one of the best MST3K episodes! In a nutshell, why I loved it:

FIRST- The credits flanking the front & back of this flick....They are from ANOTHER FREAKIN' MOVIE! Some big curly-haired white guy (who is SO NOT MILES O'KEEFE) and some big black guy in a swamp with feather-headressed guys in caves (not the same cave people from the movie), heck there's NOBODY of color in this film for pete's sake!

SECOND- The usual craziness mentioned by everyone else: The modern hang-glider that Ator just whips out of nowhere in two seconds (flying over a modern town at one point accompanied buy cheesy Soap-Opera music). The tire track shot. The Ray-Ban guy. The marathon prequel-flashback with the spider-puppet. The boring old guy. The delightfully fey and FAAAABULOUS ""Freddie Mercury The Hun"" with his weird swan-shaped Samauri-chapeau. The pretty, hubcap-wearing heroine who can't seem to decide if she's a mighty warrior-woman or ditzy Damsel-In-Distress. As fun as the main bad guys is, the bulk his screen time consists of his endless, BORING philiosophical sparings with the old boring Old Wise Guy (Mr. 'Faux-Asian Fu Man Mercury' only gets mean at the last moment, giving the poor geezer a real good thrashin'...something we have been wanting to do the entire flick, mean as it sounds). The 'Cave-Dwellers' are a mere subplot! Why name the movie after it? Why not ""Ator and The Great Rescue Journey"" or ""Saving The Old Wise Master"" or ""Ator Conquers The Dark Huns of Doom"" or something? Why not keep the original title, ""Ator The Invincible""? It's like retitling ""The Wizard Of Oz"" with the name ""The Fighting Anthropormorphic Apple Trees"" or ""I Hate Miss Gulch"" or ""Henry & Em's Busted Incubatior Machine""! Sure the Caveman Chieftain devouring the human heart is disturbing, but still......

THIRD- The host segments, which are priceless. Joel & The Bots (J&TB) ""lucid credit sequence"" in which they reenact the credits (as the proper characters. the faux-credits are a scream). After the film, we get a shot of the shaken J&TBs (Joel's expession alone is comedic gold) then their rundown of the goofs in the movie (similar to the 'They Just Didn't Care' bit they did in the 'Attack Of The Eye Creatures' episode). Love it.

FOURTH- Of course, we get Miles and Miles AND MILES O'KEEFE!!! The funny thing is, the concept of the Ator character could've been cool. Ator is not only a big Barbarian guy, he's a scientist, engineer, physician, alchemist, martial artist, blacksmith AND explosives expert, not to mention less crude (Conan was merely a big dumb Barbarian). Unfortuneately Ator (which would've been a briliant character if he were done right) is a chessy dopey character played by a cheesy dope in a cheesy dopey, poorly-done bunch of flicks which cheesy dopey production values & is basically a big beefy lump-o-cheeze! Ator COULD'VE been the more sensitive, noble, jack-of-all-trades alternative to the Mighty Conan but he ends up being a cheesy ripoff who only big accomplishment is being Tarzan. Therefore, America & the World is still stuck with a big dumb Austrian guy who speaks poor English (and his own comic books) as our great Barbarian extrodinare and Governor Of California.

Well, that's my review. Oh.....Joel & The Bots are cute, nuff said.

So please partake of this great show in all it's incarnations. I love this cool  show, ""Joel Is A Janitor""...no...""Dr. Forrester Wears Green""...no...""Larry Is An Irritating Dork""...no...""Frank's Jor-El Hairdo""..no wait...""Bobo Has A Red Butt""...""Mike Blows Up A Planet...AGAIN""...or is it, ""Mike Does MORRISSEY""...""Joel & Mike Are Cute""...""The Cute Bots""....""Tom Servo Was Made With A Gumball Machine""....OR RATHER THE PROPER, NON-SUBPLOT-SPECIFIC TITLE (unlike this version of 'Ator The Invincible') , ""MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000""!!!",1254182400,,3972,5.148837209302326
757021,3,6304022662,"I'm sorry, but this bargain basement Conan rip off was so bad that even the MST3K antics could not save it (they were the only reason for three stars instead of zero).  I did get a laugh out of the bots costuming up like the idiots in the film.  And also the ""say something!"" comments (as the actors consistently missed their cues).  But this film was so bad -- the continuity, delivery of lines, ridiculous costumes. The whole thing was ridiculous.  I can't imagine how it was ever released.  (I also think the MST gang missed a chance for some great ""Freddie Mercury"" comparisons to that villian guy . . . the one that looked like Freddie Mercury).

757096,5,6304022662,"For me this is the funnies Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie.  Cave Dwellers is a really bad Conan clone, complete with giant puppet spiders and snakes and hubcap breastplates.  The acting is so terrible, the plot doesn't make any sense, and the Cave Dwellers of the title are a very minor subplot.  It's a real mess that gives the critics lots to make fun of.  The characters are just classic.  The main hero is just shouting out ""No!"" all the time.  The main villian has a really special mustache that will have you laughing out loud.  One scholar has the habit of looking straight into the camera when he gives his lines.
Lots of ridiculous things happen.  At one point, the hero is fighting invisible creatures.  I guess they couldn't afford to hire extras for the scene.  At another point, the hero is flying a hang glider.  Never mind that he wasn't carrying it, and that he didn't have any tools to make it with in the few seconds it took to cut to him flying it, but it just doesn't belong in this movie.  It doesn't make any sense, which is why it's perfect for Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Although Ator makes for great eye candy, he proves that even a hunky guy can be a brainless bimbo!  The movie and it's plot are just plain STUPID!  It is just a movie made to be torn apart and made cannon fodder for Joel and the 'bots!
It is so terrible, that after the movie, Joel and the 'bots just stare ahead.  All of Joel's hair is standing on end and he stares glass eyed with mouth open!  And how they got expressions of anger and hate on the 'bots, I don't know, but it was there!
  Dr. Forrester spoke apologetically about that movie to Joel and the 'bots, and all they did was stare ahead and growl!  Finally, Tom Servo shouted that it was the WORST movie they had to endure!  Crow took over, detailing all the movie;s flaws!

757098,2,6304022662,"This movie was billed under a couple different titles before ""Cave Dwellers"" as seen on MST 3000. First off, I am a MAJOR MST 3000 fan, I have been since I first saw the series in the early 90's. I've read the reviews for this and cannot figure out why so many people think this one is so great. This was the only MST 3000 that myself and the people who were watching it were making funnier cracks than the crew. This was one dull episode saved only by Crow's ""continuity problems"" at the end of the movie. Of all the MST's that I own this one has been watched only once. I laughed maybe 3 times through this one and not very hard. True the movie is very bad, but that alone does not make a great MST 3000. If you're wanting a really good/bad viewing experience then I would suggest Mitchell, Pod People, or Manos - The Hands of Fate, because they all beat this one hands down. I can't believe that of all the possible candidates for release that were produced during this series (King Dinosaur, anyone?), that they picked Cave Dwellers. If you are a die hard fan of the series then go ahead and add it to your collection, but try to get it used (if you pay full you'll be sorry).",1054857600,2,1180,4.202643171806168
757099,4,6304022662,"To begin Season Three of MST3K, Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank subjected Joel and the bots to Cave Dwellers, an inane, pointless, bargain-basement excuse of a movie.  The movie opens with scenes from the Cave Dwellers prequel shown in blurry, herky-jerky motion a la cheap 70s TV series, then shows us a scene involving actual cave dwellers (which will have nothing to do with the rest of the picture, by the way).  The story revolves around an evil guy wearing a black turkey hat who looks like a cross between John Saxon and the other guy from Hall and Oates on a bad day; he storms in and threatens the learned ""old man"" in an attempt to get his hands on the all-powerful ""geometric nucleus"" (a device that, by definition, is everything and nothing).  The old guy sends his daughter, who is rather easy on the eyes for a prehistoric woman, to find the great and powerful Ator who lives at the ends of the earth (fortunately only about 20 miles to the east, apparently).  Ator and his Asian sidekick return with the girl to save the wise old man and safeguard the dangerous ""geometric nucleus"" before it falls into the wrong hands.  Ator proves that his capacity for goodness exceeds his capacity to out-think the enemy, but the trio finally arrive and do battle with the silly-looking bad guy and his minions.
This is a pretty good MST3K tape, but there are better ones out there, especially from the amazing Season Three.  Cave Dwellers does feature some good skits, though.  In one, Joel shows the bots how to make cheap movie sound effects with everyday objects.  In another one, the guys dress up in stupid getups like the guys in the movie and act like they are fighting while Cambot blurs and makes the video go into a freezeframe kind of motion just like the movie used for the opening credits.  There are some great riffs and jokes from the guys in the theatre, but there are no spectacular zingers in my opinion.  If you're a Miles O'Keefe fan (and I don't see how you possibly could be), Cave Dwellers is the movie for you as his character is built around his pecs and loincloth.  I won't bother to point out the continuity problems with the movie because Crow does that for all of us after it ends.  The original Cave Dwellers film is bad, really bad, but the guys on the Satellite of Love once again somehow manage to turn a viewing ordeal into a comedic romp.

Here is the story:
Miles O'Keefe as Ator, The Fighting Eagle, gambols about in this charming mixure of Pre-historic and Medieval Europe.  He, along with mute oriental sidekick Thong, are contracted by a prehistoric scientist (the ""really dull old guy"") and his daughter to find some sort of a weapon-type-thingy that has fallen into the hands of an evil guy in a bizarre headpiece (the ""John Saxon type guy).  The evil guy and his hordes of barbarians capture them at one point, but they escape and use a variety of absurd devices to defeat the bad guys (Ator actually builds a hang-glider and flies around dropping bombs on his enemies!).  I'm not sure what happened at the end, but an overly dramatic narrator mumbles something, Ator rides off into the sunset, and then there is an explosion and a mushroom cloud rises on the horizon.  Huh?
Another strange movie.  This one was teeming with continuity errors and ridiculous elaborately named props that are wonderfully lampooned in two host segments.

757102,5,6304022662,"MST3K's third season was from end to end an almost unbroken string of great performances -- some of the Brains' best and most consistent work ever. Show 301, 'Cave Dwellers,' was the leadoff hitter. All MSTies need this episode on the video shelf.
'Cave Dwellers' is a pseudo-caveman, vaguely Gor-like, Conan the Somewhat Unpolished, Ridley Scott on a really, really, bad day kind of flick. Hubcaps double for armored breastplates. Our Hero Ator, played by the incomparable Miles O'Keefe, throws together some sticks and fur and hang-glides into the enemy castle. And continuity? As Crow shows us in the final host segment, continuity apparently wasn't a concern here.

757205,5,6304022662,"This MST3K gem takes on ""Cave Dwellers"", a badly dubbed Italian rip-off of Conan. It is one of the better MST episodes released on video so far. It ""stars"" gym-pumped Miles O'Kefee as Ator, the noble barbarian warrior with ""pecs like melons and knees of fringe"" and numerous Italian non-actors who look embarrassed to be there. Ator is also armed with a leather harness, big furry boots, a fluffy 80s haircut and a really small loincloth.
In an age that mixes stone-age cavemen with medieval European castles, a wise old man possesses the ""Geometric Nucleus"". This shiny cubic thingamajig has incredible powers and must not fall into the hands of the evil guy who approaches. You know he is incredibly evil because he is wearing a Cher wig, a glued on mustache and a big helmet shaped like a swan. The old man (who... delivers... all... his... lines... incredibly... slowly...) explains to his daughter Mila that Ator is their only hope. Cue long and silly flashback that covers the previous movie, Ator the Fighting Eagle. The flashback includes lines like ""After killing the spider-god, Ator captured the glistening charm-shield of Murdor"". (Joel: ""And his secret decoder ring!"" Crow: ""This must be Ator's home movies""). Old man tells his daughter to ""run to the end of the world....where nature itself....seems to decline to follow you further...."" (Tom: ""Canada?"") and fetch Ator. Mila covers most of the earth in about 10 minutes; then she gets shot in the chest with an arrow. This wound causes her to LIMP the rest of the way to a cave, where Ator and his mysterious Asian sidekick Thong heal her by wrapping her head in banana leaves as a huge slobbering dog in the background looks on. (Crow: ""Well, now it's all up to the dog... No Marmaduke! Don't use the triple overhand stitch! Bad dog!"")
The three travel back to the old man, having lots of generic fantasy-movie encounters on the way, including invisible enemies (you know they are there because the actors throw themselves to the ground pretending to get hit), cannibalistic cave dwellers, and a gang of fearsome samurai-imitators who would probably rather be in a Kurosawa film. A slightly longer sub-plot involves freeing a village from a human-sacrificing, snake-god worshipping cult. In the hilarious sacrifice scene a couple of lazy and innocent snakes are made ""scary"" by adding lots of plaster skulls on the floor and growling noises on the soundtrack. Ator gets to wrestle a big cuddly snake-puppet in semi-darkness. (Joe:""It's not slimy at all."" Crow:""That's because it's made of velour"": Tom: ""Just cut the wires Ator!"")
When they finally arrive at their destination, Thong and Mila enter the castle through a secret tunnel (which is very un-secret and well-lit for their convenience). Meanwhile, Ator creates an unnecessary distraction by building a modern hang-glider out of some twigs in about 30 seconds and using it to drop flash powder bombs on the enemy. The end fight against evil guy is just as goofy of course. By the way, this ""caveman learns aerodynamics in seconds"" plot device would later be reused with equal logic and success by L. Ron Hubbard and John Travolta in their Scientology crap-feast Battlefield Earth. Check out how many mention MST3K in the BE reviews!
The host segments are great too and include a lesson on how to make bad sound effects on a limited budget, and how to make cheap props look seem more impressive. Instead of calling the thing the daughter is wearing on her chest a hubcap (and it clearly is a hubcap), you call it something like ""the golden maiden shield of Zondar"". Best of all is the segment where they pause the film to show us continuity problems like ""villagers"" wearing sunglasses, and tire tracks or modern cities being glimpsed in the background. Brilliant episode.

From the opening credits (starring two characters who aren't even part of the feature itself) to the elaborate flashback scene, to the wonderfully schlocky ending battle, this is a masterpiece of the horrid, a movie that makes you laugh and wince simultaneously, wondering all the while, ""How on EARTH did this movie get made?!?""  In fact, it's so dreadful that TV's Frank and Dr. Forrester each feel the need to apologize to Joel at various points.  Now, if that isn't a clear sign that this is something special, I don't know what is.  The commentary is inspired (as always).  Buy it.  Watch it.  Live it.  ""How much Keefe is in this movie?""

757209,5,6304022662,"The year was 1994 and I had never seen a single episode ofMST3K.  I had heard of it, and I was intrigued by the concept: a showthat mocked bad movies from a satellite orbiting Earth.  I was but a naive youth, callow and unprepared for what was to follow, clueless about what I was getting into that late night in my collegiate dorm room. Then came ""Cave Dwellers"" and from that moment on, I was officially a MSTie.  And I have never felt less than fortunate for what I discovered--in short, my favorite television series ever.
And what a great primer on the show.  ""Cave Dwellers"" (which is merely a retitled version of a movie called ""The Blade Master"") is a plummeting duck of a movie.  Obviously made for undemanding audiences, this quickie rip-off of the ""Conan"" movies stars the one and only Miles O'Keeffe, whose only talent involves his ability to be handsome.  He's straight-forward, whip-smart, true-to-the-core, and dull, dull, dull.  But guess what? He's not half as dull as the rest of the cast, except for the actor playing the villain.  Strangely enough, he seems to be getting the joke, if not mastering the language he was speaking. He plays the bad guy with a bit of a wink, like he knew this was a crummy B-pic, so he might as well have fun with the part.  Too bad his energy didn't spread to the rest of the cast, or to the rote script or by-the-numbers action sequences.  And get a load of the oft-mentioned hang glider!  In the long shots, it's obviously an aluminum frame, but in the close-ups, it's hemp rope and tree branches.  As Servo says, ""Let's see.  He killed a deer, tanned and stretched the hide, built an annodized aluminum frame, learned to extrude and weld, all in about five minutes...and learned aerodynamics?""
Of course, all of these errors only add to the hilarity as Joel and the 'Bots let the movie have it with both barrels.  This is definitely a great first episode to watch if you've never seen the show before, and one to own if you don't already have it.
NOTE: Many people comment on the half-hour flashback that occurs early in the movie.  Well, here's the story behind that--it's from a prequel called ""Ator, the Fighting Eagle"", I kid you not.  It occasionally plays on cable stations late at night, and was the first of the THREE Ator movies. What possessed the filmmakers to do three of these?
