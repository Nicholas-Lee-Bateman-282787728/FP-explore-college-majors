6095693,5,B00GOM5AM6,"People who understand good filmmaking and acting will appreciate this film. Everything about this movie was incredible. Great work from the director and actors in this film. An engaging and intense plot, dynamic performances - it is simply a must see. It will stay on your mind well after the credits roll.",1414540800,3,306,4.903846153846154

6095695,5,B00GOM5AM6,"The movie came through USPS, in a fast manner. Great production, great service, and great people! I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see what 1973 land disputes did to families in Southern Arkansas. Coming of age story for a young boy that lost almost everything. Great strength and character.",1392163200,2,302,4.9411764705882355
6095696,5,B00GOM5AM6,"This was a great purchase this month, I am beyond excited that I made this buy. Finally sat down to watch this piece and WOW - what a movie. Its a beautifully crafted, well written, incredibly acted, and cinematically shot film that needs to gain attention. Derrick Sims blew me away with his film and was able to keep my interest the whole movie through the plot, dynamic characters, and cinematography. One of the best shot films I've seen thus so far. I recommend this to any true cinema lover!!!",1389398400,4,499,4.555555555555555

6095698,1,B00GOM5AM6,movie made no sense. If you have nothing better to do then stare at a wall then this movie will be okay watching otherwise don't waste your time,1505001600,,144,4.178571428571429
6095699,4,B00GOM5AM6,I enjoyed this movie. Had some suspense and a story line you could follow.,1504828800,,74,4.357142857142857
6095700,4,B00GOM5AM6,"The plot and setup seemed kind of implausible to me, but the acting was decent, and the pace wasn't belabored.  There didn't seem to be an overall point to the movie, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  The kid seemed to play younger than his years, which I blame on the dialogue.  This was not something I'd be in a great hurry to watch again, but it was worth seeing once.",1504310400,,369,4.242857142857143

6095702,1,B00GOM5AM6,"I got through 27 mins. That little boy was annoying and naive af, his character was very one-dimensional. The film was nothing but dialogue and the dialogue was absolutely painful to listen to. A waste!",1503964800,,202,4.8
6095703,1,B00GOM5AM6,"Horrible.  After a certain point, one is challenged to watch the movie in its entirety just hoping to understand and see something that is interesting.  The boy in the movie is the dumbest child I have ever seen.  He has to be atleast 10 years old yet capable of NOTHING but making the situation worse.  He shoots someone, manages to not help the grandfather, drops the batteries, etc...  Soooo unbelievable.  Sits and moans about being hungry????? Who wrote this,  Kid can't help the grandfather do anything yet is able to to it by himself after his grandfather dies???????? Really????  Sorry for the spoilers, if you are reading this.

This movie is pathetic and hard to understand.  Never did figure out what happened to the father.  Waste of time,",1503792000,,751,4.7890625
6095704,5,B00GOM5AM6,"Be ready for an emotional roller coaster that only goes one way: DOWN. This movie should be required viewing for every psychiatric social worker, nurse and psychiatrist in a nut house. This kid (not a spoiler) got Post Traumatic Stress Disorder about 6 different ways before the movie is over. No child could stay sane after all of that. This is a THRILLER, a spooker, a bunch of brilliant acting (OMG who was that KID! It was like watching a young Christian Bale!), a plot that twists and twists. Even tho  I'm lying here with a German Shepherd that would kill anyone for getting within 10 feet of me, I'm scared out of my mind. Here's what is great: the pacing, the ACTING, the CASTING, the musical score, the SCREENPLAY especially the realistic dialog, the eyes of the mother (OMG! Never seen anyone pull off a performance like that with the camera only on her eyes), the PLOT, the DIRECTION, the photography, the setting. If you're tired of third-rate films and worried that this is another one: IT IS NOT. WATCH IT! Then you'll know why it got almost all 5-star ratings. I'm too scared to go to sleep now!",1500854400,5,1110,4.55
6095705,4,B00GOM5AM6,"Not much going on in this film other than a solid little story that moves along nicely, is believable and the cast delivers it. If you're looking for a feel good hunting story with a kid and his Grandfather then this isn't it. Its what Id call a slice of life story that happens and theres nothing you can do to change the outcome. We weren't disappointed in this one.",1498953600,,368,4.271428571428571

6095712,3,B00GOM5AM6,"To start with you cannot accidentally shoot someone thinking they are prey if you are following all the rules of hunting.  Plain and simple.  No such thing as an accident, just carelessness and stupidity.  If you do not see 100% of your target and what is behind and beside it, you do not shoot.",1496793600,2,295,4.425925925925926
6095713,4,B00GOM5AM6,An odd little movie that is definitely worth watching. It makes you wonder what a more coherent script and story line - along with a less glacial pace - could have produced. But the solid acting and atmosphere make up for the deficiencies in storytelling.,1496793600,2,255,4.688888888888889

6095716,2,B00GOM5AM6,"I'm sure most people will like it but for me it was too unrealistic and extreme, like it was written by someone with a preconceived ideal of how a bunch of country folks would act like in such a situation, during the 1970's. I stopped the movie to look up the guy who wrote and directed the story. Sure enough, it was written by Derrick Sims, who was 27 years old when the movie premiered in 2012. Sorry, but one or two dimwits, maybe, but a bunch of them is ridiculous. I'm guess that the people who awarded him prizes for this movie, were all born in 1984 or there about. Rather insulting to the intelligence of country folks of the 1970's and more recent.",1495843200,3,658,4.272

6095718,5,B00GOM5AM6,"I got to give a lot of credit to the director for capturing rural life with the authenticity of his own background. As someone that has lived in the South for a number of years, this film is genuine in its delivery.

The story, like a good Southern Gothic tale, revolves around a long standing feud between two families over land. While a grandfather and a son are out hunting, they manage to kill a member of a rival family by accident. What began as an ordinary hunting trip soon plummets into a downward spiral towards a tragic conclusion.

The hypnotic cinematography, ubiquitous ambience of the soundtrack, along with realistic dialogue, pulls the viewer into how one tragic accident can unravel everything. Definitely a must see for fans of these types of rural Southern gothic films.",1494720000,8,790,4.801470588235294

6095721,4,B00GOM5AM6,"A nice little dark film that heartbreakingly starts with a mistake and twists with a sinister finish. Well acted and well written.

6095736,5,B00GOM5AM6,"This was a surprisingly well done suspense drama (it comes up under horror for some reason, but it's definitely not). Very atmospheric and realistic. A lot of people will probably find it slow and boring, but it's very much reminiscent of serious and thought-provoking dramas from the 60s and 70s and the quietest movies are often the ones that end up haunting you. It reminded me a lot of A Simple Plan in terms of tone and theme. The somber, tightly-controlled color palette and rural setting also reminded me of The Other, stylistically. It's always a pleasant surprise when a low-budget movie filled with a cast of unknowns doesn't feel low-budget at all. The lighting, sets, acting, and soundtrack here are top-notch. There's ""making a movie"" and there's ""practicing one's craft,"" and everyone who worked on this was clearly very skilled in their craft.",1477958400,16,858,4.965277777777778

6095738,1,B00GOM5AM6,"Boring Movie, I selected horror and searched... this is what came up in the mix. This movie is in no way scary at all. It tries to be suspenseful, but fails at that. It jumps back and forth several times which makes it a little hard to follow. The ending is almost just as bad as the beginning. Do not waste your time this is not a good watch at all.",1476748800,,350,3.943661971830986
6095739,1,B00GOM5AM6,"This movie was slow and boring and leaves a big question at the end.

Pay attention to how much time goes by every time they say things like ""we don't have much time"" or ""better get going"" or ""won't be gone long"". They even have time to nod off and fall asleep when there isn't much time left.

It could have been a really good movie and I stuck with it hoping it would get better. However, when they left one big question unanswered (maybe because it was getting dark soon?), I couldn't give it any more than 1 star. I can forgive most everything if you give me a satisfying ending.",1474934400,,583,4.196428571428571

6095746,5,B00GOM5AM6,It's a heartbreaking coming of age story about two feuding families. It's about justice taking place in the worse kind of way through Karma and the cleanup of the repercussions. When watching this film you have to pay close attention because past events have a direct bearing on the present.  The story is deadly serious and there are not any light moments. It was a well done drama. I gave it a five.,1466208000,2,401,4.493150684931507

6095750,3,B00GOM5AM6,"Released in 2012, ""Come Morning"" is a backwoods drama/mystery about a grandfather and grandson (Michael Ray Davis & Thor Wahlestedt) and their misadventures when taking a hunting trip in backwoods Arkansas. The screenplay focuses on the downside of masculinity, rural property disputes and death.

The story evidently takes place in 1973, which I didn't know until after watching the movie because country folk today generally wear the same kinds of clothes as they did back then and drive similar old trucks, etc. In other words, there's no observable reason it couldn't take place in modern times. Another minor issue is the way the story switches to flashbacks without indicating it to the viewer. Of course I was able to gather that it was a flashback, but why not use an appropriate device to indicate this to the audience?

Regardless, the movie has a great haunting ambiance with a quality score, excellent woodsy photography and good actors, all reminiscent of the haunting rural atmospherics of films like 2010's ""Winter's Bone,"" 2008's ""Frozen River"" and 2006' ""That Beautiful Somewhere."" It's the least of these, however, no doubt because of the $46,000 budget, which resulted in too many holes in an already ambiguous story. Moreover, while the plot's fine, the script is too mundane and fails to create a compelling experience.

My wife and I watched the movie separately yesterday and neither of us could figure it out. The story provokes questions, but the ending fails to deliver the answers. We're not the types who need to be ""spoon fed"" answers. In fact, we enjoy figuring movies out and usually can; see my review of 2001's ""Wendigo"" for evidence. Unfortunately, too much of ""Come Morning"" remains a mystery; even after watching (most of) the director's commentary to find answers. We found some answers, like the identification of the character of Morrigan (Elise Rovinsky), whom we thought was simply the kid's mother, but that's not the case. ***MILD SPOILER*** The story ends with someone's ring found in someone else's possession and neither the movie nor the commentary reveal the significance of this. So this character has a certain person's ring on him, so what? Before you answer, ""The ring is supposed to incriminate so and so,"" I get that, but incriminate him for what? Hunting in a prohibited area? Whoopee. Don't tell me he'll be incriminated for murder because (1.) it doesn't apply to the dead person in question and (2.) just because someone has another person's ring in his/her hand doesn't mean much. No matter how you slice it it's a weak ending.***END SPOILER***

The director and the other commentator reveal that they weren't able to include a lot of scenes from the original script, either because they didn't have the money/time to shoot them or they did and the footage was unusable for one reason or another. As such, there are just too many holes in the story and it leaves you unsatisfied. The director/writer makes the viewer work hard, but then fails to provide answers. Yet the story's not very compelling anyway; so even if they were able to include more revelatory material it still wouldn't help the mundane nature of the proceedings. That said, ""Come Morning"" is worth catching just for the mysterious backwoods cinematography and score, not to mention the quality actors; that is, if you appreciate the aforementioned similar films.

I hope the director makes more films because he's got talent, but he's going to need bigger budgets to do so effectively, plus improve his script-writing skills.

The film runs 80 minutes and was shot in Cleveland County, Arkansas.

GRADE: C- (or a weak 3/5 Stars)",1445299200,,3655,5.001644736842105
6095751,5,B00GOM5AM6,"Director/screenwriter Derrick Sims has acknowledged the influence of early 20th century American writers on his works. Clearly apparent here is the influence of Faulkner: The dialogue is spartan and impressionistic, the characters emotionally stifled, especially Frank, whose maddening and complete lack of self-awareness screams of both Faulkner and, perhaps even more so, Hemmingway. His story is more pathedy than tragedy, more Humbert Humbert than Pat Tilman. The pace is deliberate and plodding, evoked most clearly by the slow, smooth pan through the woods in the opening credits, accompanied by deep strings and solo piano. The tenor is somber from the opening minute, and Sims' choice to resist the urge to speed up the pace in the final third was the right one.

The best two things about this movie were the cinematography and the soundtrack. Both of those elements were better than a film of this budget is supposed to have. The compositions and use of light were spot on, especially in the shed scenes. Sims' ability to achieve atmosphere with hd film is as good as I've ever seen. This is a personal issue for me: I have lamented for the past several years how being able to see individual droplets of fog machine spewtum in a 1080 movie ruins it for me. The Exorcist woulda sucked in modern HD.

The soundtrack was particularly effective. The music was the exact right tempo and of the exact right tone for the story.  This was one of those films where the score almost becomes another character in the film.

The sparse dialogue will leave this film open to possible claims of deus ex machina, most notably when the mother allows the boy to go back into the woods with his grandfather after she finds out about the accident.  Previous dialogue and body language between the mother and Frank, combined with the fact itself that she let him go back out, explains the nature of their relationship and disfunction. The watcher is expected to work that one out for himself.  I found myself willing to do so.

An impressive early work from a gifted young filmmaker. If he gets his due, you'll be hearing the name Derrick Sims again.",1438560000,2,2141,4.817438692098093
6095752,5,B00GOM5AM6,"Extremely well done! This is a dark story with a major change in the grandson ""D"" that we see by the end of the movie. It is very thought provoking and a movie that requires you to pay attention,  so as to catch all of the nuances. It leaves you wondering about the characters,  but not in a way that just makes you feel cut off. Derrick Sims left the story open so that you can finish the story yourself.

Extremely well done and worth watching over and over again to catch more of the story. I highly recommend this drama!! :)",1437004800,3,528,4.1568627450980395

It's camerawork (see the gunshot scene) and lighting capture a dark and beautiful southern charm that makes this movie unique. It's use of authentic locations, sound, and talent mean that every bit is completely genuine.

There is heart and soul in this film. The filmmaker takes his time to establish the characters and the back story without spoon feeding to the audience. It's commentary on family and identity make it perfect for a moviegoers next screening. Love it or hate it this film will have a profound effect on you.",1423699200,2,615,4.80188679245283
6095756,2,B00GOM5AM6,"Good production. Better than average cinematography. Could have maybe been a good story. But the story telling is just so slow, like they're trying to fill time. And much of the dialogue (what little there is) and acting does not seem natural. And at a length of just 1 hour 15 minutes, the movie seems quite a bit longer, as the story just seems to creep slowly by and take forever to be told. If the story had just a little more to tell, or was told just a little better, maybe it wouldn't have had to been so seemingly drawn out to fill just an hour-fifteen.

If you think you might be interested in this film, definitely wait to rent. Not worth the purchase price to me.",1423699200,,674,4.265625
6095757,5,B00GOM5AM6,"Sometimes we grow up much too fast, and by the time the morning comes, ten year old D will have aged far beyond his years.

The movie starts with D's mother attempting to persuade her father-in-law not to take D hunting. But D's grandfather is a stubborn man, set in his ways, and despite her pleas, he takes D hunting. It's a decision that all will soon regret because while out hunting, D shoots and kills a neighbor. D only wants to confess the crime. But because D's family and the family of the neighbor have bad blood, D's grandfather determines to cover the crime. What unfolds is a suspenseful as it is touching. D understands that his crime has gravity but perhaps not to the extent is should. All D's grandfather can focus on is the potential impact to the family.

The movies covers one night in their lives. But it is a harrowing journey. And by its end, D is older and wiser. But we can guarantee that he will never be the same. Mornings tend to shed new light. But that light isn't always a good light.",1423094400,14,1016,4.342105263157895

6095765,5,B00GOM5AM6,"A true gem of the indie filmmaking world.  Well shot, well directed, scored very well. There really aren't any weaknesses to this film. It hits hard from beginning to end and leaves nothing to be desired.  Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys Indie dramas!",1415923200,,259,4.863636363636363
6095766,5,B00GOM5AM6,"Sometimes in life you come to a fork in the road...and you take the wrong one.

You end up somewhere even the Devil doesn't want to go...

From the near perfect soundtrack by Justin Slaughter to the natural flow of an unending nightmare for a child trying to do the right thing, trapped in a world made by adults that he doesn't understand, this film delivers in 80 minutes what many try and fail to do in 3 hour epics.

If you appreciate films like Winter's Bone ( which if you haven't seen is a must see for Jennifer Lawrence's break through performance) then do not hesitate seeing this film.",1415664000,4,595,4.390909090909091

8625622,1,B00GOM5AM6,Alot of the movie was shot in the dark and was very hard to see what was going on.  It was very drawn out.. Much better movies out there.,1530144000,,137,3.7241379310344827
8625623,1,B00GOM5AM6,"What a shame.  Could have been much better with imagination.  It almost seems that it has become ""chic"" to write a script with many disconnects throughout, where the viewer has to fill in the blanks.  Just sloppy - lazy writing.  And, not sure what the director was going for with the kid's character; almost seems like he was Autistic ... ?  Again, we have to fill in the blank.  The trailer looks like an exciting thriller - don't be fooled.  Skip this one.",1527811200,,459,4.457831325301205

I would have given more stars, but that glaring error made the whole movie, in my opinion, sloppily and carelessly done. Ruined it for me.",1526342400,,289,4.8

8625627,4,B00GOM5AM6,"Pretty good psychological thriller, not really a horror film, about a deer hunt that goes very bad.  Slow moving but well made, this film is more sad than it is intense or disturbing.  Definitely worth a watch.",1521676800,,210,4.648648648648648
8625628,3,B00GOM5AM6,"Pretty slow and boring at times, even the actors look bored.  I struggled to make it through all the way to the end, but I made it.  It got interesting at some parts but they were few and far between.  I wasn't crazy about the kid's character, just annoyed me for some reason.  The only likeable person in the movie imo was the grandfather. Its pretty meh all around.",1521417600,,367,4.27536231884058
