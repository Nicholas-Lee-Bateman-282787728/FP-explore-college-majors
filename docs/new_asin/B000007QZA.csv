1196933,5,B000007QZA,"I bought this set in a big box store somewhere, never having seen ""One Step Beyond"" the first time around.  But knowing that ""Twighlight Zone"" was something I loved viewing on the SciFi Channel I purchased this - and LOVED IT!

There is something slightly more mannered yet weird in the production.  There are many famous young faces.  The stories are based on ""true account"" and in this it has a slightly tabloid feel.

Watching it a year later - I again loved it.  That tells me it is a good DVD investment.  I would take the risk if you've never seen ""One Step Beyond"" but enjoy the age and the genre.",1248912000,28,604,4.339285714285714
1196934,1,B000007QZA,"While the episodes from One Step Beyond are classic and wonderful, the quality of the videos themselves is quite poor.  If the orignal film had dirt on it scratched, or there was a break in it, those effects showed up on the video.  The sound at times dragged. The fading in and out scenes were handle in an abrupt manner and not in a smooth flowing fashion.  It's a real shame that the company that produced this video set didn't do a better job.  I was truly disappointed.",1165881600,3,474,4.3522727272727275
1196935,2,B000007QZA,"This is a box set of five videotapes/forty episodes (eight episodes per tape) of the vintage television series, ""One Step Beyond"" hosted by John Newland.  For those of you who are too young to remember, ""One  Step Byond"" was an anthology series somewhat in the same vein as the  ""Twilight Zone"" but focusing more on psychic and/or occult  phenomenon allegedly based on true occurences.  As one might expect, these  true(?) stories were dramatized for television.  ""One Step  Beyond"" was a good show and a worthwhile addition to any horror/sci-fi  video collection.  However, I rated these episodes as two stars because of  the poor quality of the videos.  These videos are standard play (SP) mode  but this did little to enhance the quality.  The videos are not remastered  or enhanced at all.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, however, the  original film print often suffers from dirt, scratches, spots, and age.  The fade-ins and fade-outs are sometimes ""choppy"" presumably from  editing or mishandling by local televsion stations while in syndicated  reruns.  Overall, I am glad I purchased this set.  It is watchable and  better than nothing.  However, I think ""One Step Beyond"" deserves  respect and a much better treatment than ""Bridgestone Multimedia""  (the manufacturer) has given it.",964396800,45,1296,5.140096618357488
1196936,1,B000007QZA,"I looked forward to receiving this disc and was greatly dissapointed!  The material used was sliced, chopped-up 16mm prints.  The picture is dark and the sound is low.  ONE STEP BEYOND was a great show and you'll enjoy seeing  the shows again but the poor quality video will take away from that.",960076800,66,295,4.615384615384615
1196937,5,B000007QZA,"I used to love watching this series on television and when I saw they were still available, I ordered a set of four DVDs.
It bought back old memories, and I enjoyed them very much.
Thank you.",1397606400,2,191,4.1891891891891895
1196938,2,B000007QZA,"I thought this would be interesting; because, I like to watch shows like Twilight Zone and I expected this to be like it, only with true stories. I watched it once and I haven't watched it again. So people may like it; but I didn't care for it.",1394323200,2,244,4.104166666666667
1196939,1,B000007QZA,These DVDs are absolutely terrible! I can't believe they are being sold with such poor quality. I can barely see the picture or make out images. Disgraceful!!,1327449600,5,158,4.888888888888889
1196940,4,B000007QZA,I would suggest watching these DVDs on an old style TV as if you watch them on a wide screen (like an LCD/Plasma/etc) it has terrible quality.,1326758400,3,142,4.296296296296297
1196941,3,B000007QZA,"Six months ago, I would have given this set a four star rating with no reservations, happy for what we OSB fans could get, usually nothing more than bad transfers through Mill Creek, etc. I decided to finally add my thoughts to the review of this product now because, as Christmas comes up, people may be looking for gift ideas. This is okay, and it has a good assortment of episodes from the series (20 episodes), but if you are looking for a gift, do put the extra bucks out and get the official first season. This seems like such a good deal, I know, but the prints are very, very rough - I would go so far as to say that a couple of the episodes are unwatchable -, and it's really, now, only something I'd watch in a real pinch. I know $40 for the official release seems like alot for DVDs now, but the clean up job on the episodes is absolutely staggering, and whoever the lucky recipient is of the official set will keep it, take care of it and appreciate it. If you can still only swing this version, here are the eps included: ""Vanishing Point"", ""Dead Ringer"", ""Open Window"", ""Gypsy"" (The Robert Blake episode), ""To Know The End"", ""The Vision"", ""The Riddle"" (really rough transfer), ""The Lovers"" (awful transfer, wrong credits), ""The Sorcerer"", ""The Dark Room"", ""The Aerielist"", ""The Return of Michael Campion"", ""The Peter Hurkos Story, Parts 1 and 2"", ""Goodbye Grandpa"", ""Where Are they?"", ""Encounter"" (unwatchable), ""Executioner"" and ""The Explorer"" (again, transfer so bad, unwatchable). Hope this helps out someone trying to decide on a Christmas gift!",1290211200,30,1563,4.6872727272727275
1196942,5,B000007QZA,It was what I wanted. I will be ordering more of them.,1257984000,3,54,3.5833333333333335
1196943,5,B000007QZA,"This is a great video.  It's like the twilight zone with a twist-they are true stories.  Would reccommend highly, great price too.",1255996800,3,130,4.863636363636363
1196944,5,B000007QZA,"I remember watching this series with my Dad ""way back when"".  I was just in awe...the Twilight Zone premiered  soon after it but this was the first TV series to delve into the paranormal.  Dad and I watched it together again.  We both still loved it!",1255046400,9,250,4.369565217391305
1196945,4,B000007QZA,This program reminds me of Unsolved Mysteries which aired two or three decades later and was a documentary with a narrator speaking to the viewer and showing them pictures.  This program takes unsolved mysteries of the early 1900s and adds fictional filler to make a dramatization of what the characters might have done.  I am giving it four stars because the script writing is not as good as in Twilight Zone.,1254441600,2,410,4.76056338028169
1196946,2,B000007QZA,"I am a ""One Step Beyond"" fan for sure, but I was disappointed by this release. There are 12 episodes on a two-sided disc, but the quality of the DVD content is poor. The source material appears to be transferred from an old VHS tape. The opening and closing credits are incomplete as well. In the middle of the ending credits, it pauses and jumps to the next episode. True classic television purists will find this unacceptable. However, the Miracle Pictures release of ""The Veil"" is not like this.",1253232000,19,498,4.606741573033708
7905193,4,B000007QZA,"Much as I remember watching as a child, but production values can be very week and acting can leave a little to be desired; but it is of an early era in TV SciFi/",1488499200,,162,3.7941176470588234
7905194,3,B000007QZA,"I recall this program from my high school days in the early 60s. My recollection of this program is better than the reality of it as revealed by this collection. Over the last 50 years, the quality of television has improved dramatically. ""One Step beyond"" is more of a memory now. it just does not stand up to what is available today.",1474588800,,335,4.419354838709677

I enjoy jogging and the step DVD keeps me  in shape to run for  miles.. I am now
79 years old and still stepping with Diane building up to get back into jogging after about 10 weeks off.",1470787200,,261,4.0
