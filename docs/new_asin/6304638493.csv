7875349,3,6304638493,"National Lampoon's Dad's Week Off is an all right movie.  There's some funny scenes, but some of the dialouge is just stupid.  It's one of Neal Israel's better films though.  This isn't a real Lampoon movie; the only  connection it has is the new owner, James P. Jimirro, co-executive produced  it.  This was one movie in a seven-picture deal NatLamp made with Paramount  and Showtime.  Two better movies are Favorite Deadly Sins and The Don's  Analyst.",943747200,,453,4.855263157894737
