8349769,5,B0023EVM6M,I am new to PhotoShop (and to SLR photography in general) and this DVD was a great introduction.  Provided a good foundation to build on and lots of tips and tricks.,1260662400,,165,4.32258064516129
8349770,5,B0023EVM6M,"I found Photoshop CS4 Basics and Beyond to be invaluable and to have truly increased my ability to use all the different elements of Bridge, Camera Raw, and Photoshop.  It was nice to review the basics again and then to go into greater detail of all aspects of the different tools, editing and publishing features of this program.  I learned a lot.  He has nice manor of teaching that was set at a nice pace.  This is an excellent DVD!",1259798400,,435,4.4
8349771,5,B0023EVM6M,"Photoshop CS4 Basics & Beyond, a tutorial by Jonathan Kingston, is by far and away for me the easiest yet to understand.  Mr. Kingston is a soft-spoken young man with a very thorough knowledge of Photoshop, Bridge and ACR who walks you step-by-step through exercises from basic to advanced.  Once one has finished all 6 sections of lessons CS4 will be at your command.  I highly recommend this teaching DVD to anyone who wants to take their photography to the next level.",1259539200,,471,4.719512195121951
