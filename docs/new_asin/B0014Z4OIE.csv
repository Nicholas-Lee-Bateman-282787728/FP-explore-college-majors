The aspect ratio looks like it was originally 4:3 stretched out to 16:9, then someone added some black bars. If they would've just made it anamorphic it would've been fine, but you have to watch it with the annoying black bars throughout the entire movie.
I seriously HATE THIS!
I don't recommend the DVD release, just try to find the VHS.
The original VHS cover is way better, plus it has the correct aspect ratio.
It's sad because this is the first MVD DVD release that I've been disappointed with. This is the same company that released many of the GG Allin DVDs, and the Danzig - Archive De La Morte DVD, which were all fine.
I guess I really can't complain because it was only $6, but I'm just warning everyone who enjoys this kind of sick stuff, if you're a collector, look elsewhere.
I know the original VHS goes for way too much, and it's very difficult to find, which is unfortunate.",1494374400,,1021,4.4361702127659575

Great midnight movie material.",1249257600,,493,4.369565217391305
8256764,3,B0014Z4OIE,"Ive been looking for this on here for a long long time.
Its a messed up movie. Seriously. But its not so much ACTUALLY disgusting stuff. Like if it has someone drinking pee. They don't actually show the
guy peeing into the container. Its all out of view. If it was real...
yeah...different story.

All in all, i think its hilarious.
It has some really BAD BAD BAD humor. Like, if your offended by guys pretending to be midgets while in black face...um seriously, don't bother. I would buy this in a heartbeat...if it wasn't $99.
I love this film...But $99?
I think not my friend. Still im glad its on here.
I absolutely want a copy of it. But after actually SEEING and LOVING
this movie. I STILL cannot justify $99.
its WELL BEYOND the epitome of a low budget B-movie.
If the seller SERIOUSLY and DRASTICALLY drops the price.
I would like to be first in line.",1195776000,,859,4.40251572327044
