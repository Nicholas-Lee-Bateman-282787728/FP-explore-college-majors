The Returned (French: Les Revenants) is a television drama series created by Fabrice Gobert and shown on Canal+ in France, BeTV in Belgium and SVT in Sweden. Eight episodes were shown from 26 November to 17 December 2012. It is an adaptation of the 2004 film They Came Back (in French titled Les Revenants). Season 2 is to air in 2014.

Credit to Wiki for the synopsis:

""In a small mountain town, many dead people reappear, apparently alive and normal: road accident victim teenager Camille; suicidal bridegroom Simon; ""Victor"", a small boy who was murdered by burglars; and Serge, a serial killer. They try to resume their lives as strange phenomena occur: amongst recurring power outages, the water level of the reservoir mysteriously lowers, revealing the presence of dead animals and a church steeple, and strange marks appear on the bodies of the living and the dead.""

Let's get the obvious out of the way.  Yes, the audio is in French and there are subtitles.  Yes, the French are generally not known for producing TV with international appeal (the excellent series ""Spiral"" being the exception).  First point: As an evolving connoisseur (like my use of French here) of international TV, I have come to actually appreciate subtitles.  Why, you ask?  I have found that watching a program (TV or movie) with subtitles requires a greater level of concentration (hence commitment).  I can't be checking my email or playing marbles on my laptop when I have to read the subtitles.  As an added benefit, I found my long forgotten high school coming back to me, as I began to understand more of the spoken words and even some of the inflection.  Second Point: It would be a huge mistake to discount Les Revenants due to the so-so reputation of French TV in general.

I was hooked after the first episode by virtue of a plot twist that I didn't see coming.  I am also interested in how people live and the imagery and bleakness of the French alpine town provides the perfect backdrop to the plot.  While it is not a perfect analogy and I am not even certain that it is a proper catch phrase, Les Revenants has a ""Twin-Peakish"" feel to it.

Give Les Revenants a chance and don't be scared off by the subtitles.  Kudos again to Sundance for taking the chance.  With ""Top of the Lake"" and Les Revenants, I can only hope that Sundance continues to introduce the USA to interesting international programming.",1383609600,,2416,4.725536992840095

Mogwai

The French series Les Revenants/The Returned aired on Sundance last evening. The music by the Scottish band, Mogwai, is essential to the mood and feel of this series.  This is a mystery, but not a who done it, it is more a question and a lot of missing parts.

The series is set in the aftermath of tragic bus accident which took the lives of an entire class of students on a school trip. The Alpine town featured in this series has beautiful scenery. We meet a young girl,climbing over an embankment onto the road and walking back to her home. She was one if the girls who perished in that tragic accident. She arrives home, goes to the refrigerator and starts eating. Her shocked mother comes into the kitchen and can't speak. Camille, the young girl apologizes for being late and says she is so hungry. She goes onto say that she doesn't know what happened, but she awoke from a nap on the side if the road. The family s confused, and in other parts of the town strange happenings are occurring. More people are showing up, the water level in the dam is dropping, the lights are going on and off. People are coming and going.

 What is happening? Is Camille real? Where are the rest of the children? What happens now?

The first episode is alarming and wondrous. No zombies, just real,people arriving home from who knows where. What is to come? Seven more episodes to go. An inviting , scary, wonderfully acted series.

8536420,5,B00960AJEC,"From the moment the butterfly bursts through the glass, to the last sombre view of the valley, ""Les Revenants"" turns the zombie genre inside out, following the unexplained return of six deceased members of a small alpine city and their effect on the lives of those who loved them. Nuanced and artfully paced, this is not the typical tale of the undead. Its horrors are psychological and implied, and really only grasped when you have time to think about them.

A girl killed three years earlier in a bus accident comes home one night to her broken family. Her mother discovers her in the kitchen, eating a sandwich, unaware of what has happened to her. Over the next seven episodes, the residents of the town find that more and more of these ""revenants"" are appearing among them, trying to resume life and relationships with loved ones who in some cases have moved on. That's when this poignant story takes a dark turn.

To avoid spoilers, I won't say more, except that you'll be haunted by questions long afterward. What is it about Julie that has drawn Victor to her? What's the full story about the Costas? Where's the line between life and death? Between love and death? An unexpectely wrenching moment is the last sight of Thomas's face, a character I'd not much regarded till that point, when I grasped the meaning of what he was doing--how often do we only realize a loved one's value as they're slipping away from us? There are many such poignant insights. Apparently a sequel is in the works, but I can't imagine how Canal+ can top this.

There's some nudity, sex and violence. Rugged language, but in French, so it went over the head of this English-speaker. I hope ""Les Revenants"" will be available in a U.S. format soon. It's the sort of series you think about long afterward, trying to understand the characters, and maybe gaining some deeper sense of the nature of mortality.",1374710400,3,1889,4.683734939759036
8536421,5,B00960AJEC,"I caught ""Les Revenants"" (TV) after reading an article on Flipboard. I own the movie from 2004 and found the article very positive. While the Movie and TV show share some basic similarities in concept, (dead loved-ones return to resume their lives) they are very different creatures. Whilst the movie was philosophical the TV show is firmly in Twin Peaks, X-Files, and Fringe mode.

Though it wouldn't be considered a family show, family, friendship, loyalty, trust are at the heart of each intertwined story.

In addition to the excellent human story lines, the soundtrack from Scottish Band Mogwai is both amazing and astonishing and is intrinsic to the overall tone of the show.

Waiting for Blu-Ray to come to US. For now, catch full episodes on YouTube.

And please, spare us a remake set in Aspen, or some such. ""Les Revenants"" should be relished and enjoyed for what it already is.",1369008000,5,888,4.860927152317881
