Since that period, technology has improved to the point where many of these phenomena can be captured in the IR spectrum with a common digital camera. Simply purchase a good tripod and set the camera to automatically record. Or one can simply randomly capture their surroundings through the sunroof of their car at convenient locations, e.g. stop signs. Good luck or bad as it may be to capture these things. ;)

I just watched the first DVD of the set of 5.

The introduction sets the tone that the photographic evidence isn't the best due to the absence of the original sources. Furthermore, this set was originally produced for VHS, not DVD. The set was simply transferred to DVD from VHS for resale. The producers are honest about the quality of the evidence presented. Overall, enough photographic material exists within the first DVD to indicate something abnormal occurring in the skies across the world. No, the evidence doesn't really prove the existence of UFOs, but the evidence does lead the viewer to question the nature of our reality. Does our physical sensory apparatus faithfully capture reality, whatever the latter really means? In other words, can an object suddenly materialize into our sensory world from elsewhere and vanish just as quickly? ;)

Sure, some of the films come from highly controversial people like ""Billy"" Meier and some ""authorities"" with a few little letters following their names feel compelled to flippantly dismiss such films without a thorough examination of the films themselves. No, I'm not claiming ""Billy"" Meier's films are genuine, because I don't feel qualified to categorically state so. However, I won't simply dismiss the possibility of their authenticity either. Legitimate differences of opinion and evidence exist for the Meier case and others as well. Regardless, one can't help watch this evidence without realizing that something strange is happening in the skies around the world.

The second DVD in the set (~1990-1992) has more interesting material. I was especially intrigued by the film shot by ""Guardian"". Pulsing, high intensity lights are frequently associated with UFOs.

The third DVD in the set (~1993-1995) has some interesting cases, e.g. the case in the UK where helicopters chase a flare, err a stationary light. ;) Some other significant cases are the semi-translucent UFO near the Twin Towers in NYC (fake?), the mass sightings in 1994 in Mexico City, the Gulf Breeze, FL sightings, and one of the sightings in Germany. Notice the diamond-shaped appearance of many of these UFOs.

The fourth DVD in the set (~1996-1998) covers the Phoenix Lights of March 13, 1997 as well as one 1995 sighting in Beijing, China. Personally, most of the NASA footage is rather mundane and consists of fast moving, linear trajectories. Occasionally, the NASA footage shows aberrant movement.

I'll update this review as necessary.",1268438400,3,3021,5.1405295315682284
8037528,1,B00062J01M,"all 5 disks were about the same.  they showed a light or a round cylinder in the sky from various locations from around the world and it seemed like 5 minutes just starring at a light or object, then switch to another light or object in another country and they did nothing, extremely boring and was expensive also to be so boring!!!!",1266969600,2,334,4.387096774193548
8037529,5,B00062J01M,"Some of the footage included is of a mediocre quality, especially the older ones from the 50s. However, as is stated in the introduction, some of these footages exist only as multiple generation copies and as a result, are not that good.

The good ones, however, are quite extraordinary, in my opinion. There are footages of sightings from all parts of the world, from America to Asia. There is also footage from Space from NASA and Russian missions which is really exciting to watch. (In particular, the footage of a ""space serpent"" is astonishing.)

I have my doubts whether all of these are authentic and not hoaxes, especially the Billy Meier videos. Another uncertainty is of course whether all these crafts are of extra-terrestial origin or just top secret man-made crafts.

By that I don't mean to say that the images are all blurry and it's hard to tell whether they are man-made or extra-terrestial crafts. Most footages are very clear and clearly show that they are something more than just a misidentified plane or birds.

In my opinion, this collection is an absolute must and last but not least, I found the musical score to be quite good and memorable.

Perhaps the only con about this collection is the fact that these are a transfer from VHS so the sound is a bit 'hissy' and the picture is of VHS quality, but other than that, I found it an excellent collection that I treasure.",1176422400,3,1395,4.677551020408163
8037530,1,B00062J01M,"Not a single shot from US soil, every clip looks the same, lights blurring in and out of focus and jumping all over the screen, never quite reaching a single frame of crispness.

Mexico, Brazil, and a few from Scotland and Great Britain but not a single US sighting when I know for a fact, the best video is typically taken in the US, they are after all based here. Coming in and out of Military airspace, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, et al..

If you want to begin to understand what this propulsion method is, reading ""The Hunt For Zero Point"" is a good place to start. Written by the Editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, it's no crackpot or spook spinning tales and mixing it with fiction. It is in fact, the only thing that makes sense; an artificially generated gravity field would produce the effects and manuevers witnessed by these craft. One inside to protect the operator, and another so that the vehicle literally 'falls' in any direction.

It's also no coincidence that the FIRST EVER sighting of a saucer was in 1947 by two Naval Intelligence Officers in a Cessna flying over Seattle. Right after we absorbed thousands of Nazi scientists. And no, they didn't make 'contact' or anything like that. They knew that there was a science that went beyond Newtonian Physics, and hid it well for over 50 years. I can only imagine what they have now.

Another great source of info is the TLC produced program called ""The Billion Dollar Secret"".",1115856000,4,1444,4.62890625
