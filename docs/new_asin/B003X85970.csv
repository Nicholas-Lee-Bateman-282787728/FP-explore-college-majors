8407809,5,B003X85970,"It is surprising to find these two little gems not in English,but this german version is splendid. First the delightful comedy,then the dark tragedy. Elisabeth Hongen performs the main roles in both,supported ably  by the charming Olive Moorefield and the tender Maria Jose DeVine In both appears Hilde Konetzni,who, like Hongen, had an illustrious career in the German repertory. Mention apart for Nino Albanese in his mute role in Das medium,who conveys  innocence and frailty rare to find in a man. Both have sad ends for the title roles,but you do not know what is worse,the comic or the tragic one. Two small operas that show the genius of Menotti.",1354406400,2,653,4.927272727272728
