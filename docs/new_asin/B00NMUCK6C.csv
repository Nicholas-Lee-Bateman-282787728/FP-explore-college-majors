8679208,5,B00NMUCK6C,"I was having fun teasing Cousin Nancy, (i.e. The one that used to be a Red-head and giggled...) about her broken DVD Player. That brought up the movie that I had to buy from France because, I don't know why it wasn't available here, it just wasn't available here.

It was all about one of the last comments Kari Whurer made on KariWhurer.net. She commented that her kids were telling people that she was working on ""Alien Tomato"" and she thought that was cute... I do miss those times when it was safe for a Public Personality to have a Web Page. Kari's was fun, I thought so, at least.

Kari Whurer in a fun movie. It's for fun, and two hours of fantasy that's almost as good as an old ""Maverick"" show with James Garner.

The plot is straight out of the '50s or '60s, and the Cowboy ends up fighting way above his class and the woman is just like you want her to be. Saucy and Intelligent. One of those women that can beat you at Bridge, or Pinochle. Not your everyday lady.

And the Cowboy has a daughter and he spent her College Savings on keeping the ranch, so you are immediately on her side, even though the ranch is close to Chicago, not out West.

But everything happens the way you know it will, and that's as it should be.

Do remember, it's a B Movie so don't expect the end of the world. But Chicago gets destroyed, and that's probably a good thing...

8679209,3,B00NMUCK6C,"Green tornados tear up the country side. A storm chaser comes to town to see what is going on as the news is not reporting the storms. She discovers government workers who want to stifle any problems.

Some interesting characters but it is slow moving and appears inexpensively made. The tornados head for the big city so it must be figured out how to confront them.",1429228800,,366,4.545454545454546
