8159105,5,B000KSQIOY,"The reg. 2 DVD from DD Entertainment has a good image.  The review on this page is for the VHS TAPE, not this DVD.  It would be helpful if Amazon posted reviews that were relevant to the item shown.

If you can play a region 2 DVD, I can recommend this.  I haven't seen the reg. 1 from Hollywood Attic and do not know if the Hollywood Attic print is a transfer from a UK print and how good that print is or ...  if it was recorded off-air.

APPOINTMENT IN LONDON is an excellent WW2 film. DIRK BOGARDE (not Laurence Harvey-an error )  gives a memorable performance as Wing-Commdr. Tim Mason determined to finish his 90th mission with his men. An inspiring film with actual footage of the amazing RAF Lancaster bombers known for their prowess in night sky raids in WW2.  I highly recommend the film.  Get the best print of it you can.",1356825600,,833,4.288461538461538
8159106,5,B000KSQIOY,"One of the best World War II RAF bomber command themed English movies along with Target for Tonight before it and The Dam Busters produced after it. A detailed story about Lancaster operations against Germany and the crews who flew them. Very accurate historically both in aircraft, uniforms and especially the pre-mission briefings and pathfinder target marking and master bomber scenes. Many later movies used scene plots from this movie in them including The Dam Busters, 633 Squadron and Star Wars IV. Typical for movies of this genre the personel relations scenes are secondary to the flying action as they should be. If you are a fan of airplane movies and especially English airplane movies this one can't fail to satisfy!",1350345600,11,729,5.033057851239669
8159107,2,B000KSQIOY,"My order came quite fast from Great Britain to the U.S. & the price was right. However I was disappointed that I was not able to play it on my VHS/DVD player here in the states. The VHS is marked ""Universal"" but I don't believe it is.",1325980800,2,234,4.0
