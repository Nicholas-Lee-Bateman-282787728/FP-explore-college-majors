3095058,5,B0012QHUB8,"Those who complain about the quality of the transfer are not understanding the film itself. The film was not shot on the best quality of film. Originally the movie was done on a very small budget with 35mm film grade that was just passable. The film appears muddy to us today because of the grade of movies we have today. You can't make the comparison of this movies picture to modern films picture because that would be unfair, the film will be muddy and pixelated no matter how much work you do on the transfer.

In comparing the DVD to the Blu Ray, the DVD was the best it could have been but grainy, this is also true for the Blu Ray it is still grainy, however, the image is more clear on the Blu Ray than the DVD, however, both the DVD and the Blu Ray really do show the limitations of the film grade itself and that can't be fixed. The sound however, is much improved the DVD was really low and compressed heavily, the Blu Ray allows you to hear every word, the music sounds more full, granted, it is only in stereo but that is a function of that being how the film was produced not a function of the actual transfer of the film, they did not record the audio in high definition surround sound.

If you are looking for the best transfer of this film you have found it! Even with all the limitations. if you are looking to complain you can also do that too nobody is going to stop you but that is a waste of time. Just enjoy the film and relax, this movie will inspire you to be your best, have a dream and live it which is something I need to continue to do in my life.",1499990400,3,1576,4.113636363636363

3095183,5,B0012QHUB8,"As a contemporary of Pete Maravich and an avid basketball player, I had always admired and borrowed from this extraordinary athlete during his playing days. I had forgotten about his life until reading his definitive biography, ""Maraviich."" My expectations were high about this half-story, expecting all sorts of creative doges. Instead, this film contains so much truth about those innocent times because it leaves un-tampered the steps to basketball success plainly for succeeding generations to follow. Pete Maravich, the greatest collegiate player to date in most ways, did not achieve the greatest fame in the NBA. It is to the producers and writers of this marvelous sport story's credit that I must say manged to sum up all of his playing time in this simple story. What goes unsaid, but could be implied here about Maravich, is that Pete's father (Press) shared his ascent in basketball until he signed in the NBA. After that, he was literally on his own. He was so ahead of his time that there was resistance to him and un-cooperation from team mates and officials and media. Without saying explicitly, the NBA resistance/reaction to Pete was symbolized in the high-school try-out depicted in this story. The objection to Pete's flamboyant style and salary limited his impact because Press, his father, could no longer be his coach/protector. The treatment of Maravich and Kareem Jabbar by the press and players was a blatant contrast; (of the two, only Jabbar assaulted another player blindly with his karate punch) . Like in this story, Pete was told too often to 'play basics' i.e. move the ball to the tall, slower ""brothers."" There was little reciprocation. To Maravich's credit, he played team ball for several years and found a way to raise all his stats slowly and leave the NBA game with his head high. Realizing a decade later how Pete Maravich's 'showtime' style was beyond the reach of his contemporaries, the NBA placed him in their Hall of Fame without personally achieving a team championship. Be that as it may, Pete Maravich was accorded the same ill-treatment as a southerner (LSU) that Happened to an equally gifted football player, Billy Cannon, a decade earlier.(both forced to play for weak teams) Remarkably, both endured the slings and arrows to excel in their sport.  This is a great re-creation of Pete Maravich's youth and bond with his father, Press, leaving out the great contributions of his father as a player and war aviator. The testimony as a special feature by Pete Maravich shortly before he passed away only enlarges this athlete's legacy as a peerless shooter and ball handler.",1450483200,6,2624,4.9908675799086755

I'm pretty sure the video transfer comes right from the VHS copy because the quality is awful!  More video noise than any movie I've ever seen (and that is a lot).

He actually wanted friends and a normal life as a child. Exploring  that area would have made it a better movie. This disc comes with extras.  Pete speaking live.  He became very spiritual before his death.  After basically walking away from basketball, a wounded warrior, physically and emotionally, he had a burning desire to play again in the rec league.  His last words to his friends during a pick up game was ""I feel great"". Within a minute he fell dead.

3095299,1,B0012QHUB8,"I don't understand all of the positive reviews on this movie. I purchased it based upon the reviews on Amazon, but here is what I found:
1. The acting was subpar, it had a low budget feel to it, from the dialogue to the ridiculous basketball sequences of him maneuvering around kids twice his size. the speed at which he moved made this whole thing very unbelievable.
2. The overall message sent through this film is disturbing. The father was obsessive and arrogant about his sons talent and the push for him to be a professional player. The son had an unhealthy focus on basketball only. Is this really what we want to teach our children?- If nothing else this movie is an example of what is rampant today in families- sports is a God and kids are submitted to ""olympiad"" like training regimines and weekends spent traveling from tournament to tournament.
3. The father was not a very good example of loving his wife. At one point he's sitting at his kitchen table with a bunch of grown men talking about how much he knows about basketball and how great his son is- his wife interrupts him and he tells her something is burning in the kitchen- she replies that she is not cooking and he tells her to go cook something.
4. This movie is supposedly marketed by ""christian"" organizations and books stores, but there is absolutely zero christian content in the whole movie. Pete at some point became a christian and there is a short special feature on it, but there are no christian values in this movie. In fact they are the opposite of what christianity is about. We are to have no God above Him- but in this movie- BASKETBALL and the dream of playing basketball is all but jammed down our throats....",1389744000,2,1701,4.525974025974026
3095300,5,B0012QHUB8,A great movie for a young basketball lover and very inspiring.  My ten year old grandson watched it at age seven and loved it even more at age ten.  The dedication and determination Pete gave to the sport of basketball was amazing.,1389484800,,231,4.476190476190476
3095321,5,B0012QHUB8,"This is a great movie and a true story too. It goes to show that with effort all things are possible with Gods help. It is a shame Pete died so young, I guess God needed another angel for his kingdom.",1388102400,,200,3.902439024390244
3095322,5,B0012QHUB8,"This movie gives real insight into the life of a true basketball legend.  If you have a young person (age 8 and above) interested in playing basketball, I would recommend they see this movie.  It gives a realistic look at how one boy pursued his dreams and made it all the way to the NBA.
Amazingly, Pete played college ball BEFORE the three-point shot was created.  And he played at a time when freshmen were NOT allowed to play with the varsity.  Yet his record to most points scored in a college career still stands!!",1388102400,4,520,4.442105263157894
3095323,4,B0012QHUB8,"I never saw anyone so focused about a career. I wish I had grown up with half that focus to do something. This movie does show how a father can impact his son for good. The movie portrays him as a very innocent person also. I don't follow basketball and don't really know him, but I hope that was accurate because I thought that was very good. This world is so sophisticated and immoral these days that it is great to see the opposite of that.
I was disappointed that the movie showed no interest in Christianity. I hope he is not without God.",1386547200,,543,4.230769230769231

3329555,5,B0012QHUB8,"Those who complain about the quality of the transfer are not understanding the film itself. The film was not shot on the best quality of film. Originally the movie was done on a very small budget with 35mm film grade that was just passable. The film appears muddy to us today because of the grade of movies we have today. You can't make the comparison of this movies picture to modern films picture because that would be unfair, the film will be muddy and pixelated no matter how much work you do on the transfer.

In comparing the DVD to the Blu Ray, the DVD was the best it could have been but grainy, this is also true for the Blu Ray it is still grainy, however, the image is more clear on the Blu Ray than the DVD, however, both the DVD and the Blu Ray really do show the limitations of the film grade itself and that can't be fixed. The sound however, is much improved the DVD was really low and compressed heavily, the Blu Ray allows you to hear every word, the music sounds more full, granted, it is only in stereo but that is a function of that being how the film was produced not a function of the actual transfer of the film, they did not record the audio in high definition surround sound.

If you are looking for the best transfer of this film you have found it! Even with all the limitations. if you are looking to complain you can also do that too nobody is going to stop you but that is a waste of time. Just enjoy the film and relax, this movie will inspire you to be your best, have a dream and live it which is something I need to continue to do in my life.",1499990400,3,1576,4.113636363636363

3329680,5,B0012QHUB8,"As a contemporary of Pete Maravich and an avid basketball player, I had always admired and borrowed from this extraordinary athlete during his playing days. I had forgotten about his life until reading his definitive biography, ""Maraviich."" My expectations were high about this half-story, expecting all sorts of creative doges. Instead, this film contains so much truth about those innocent times because it leaves un-tampered the steps to basketball success plainly for succeeding generations to follow. Pete Maravich, the greatest collegiate player to date in most ways, did not achieve the greatest fame in the NBA. It is to the producers and writers of this marvelous sport story's credit that I must say manged to sum up all of his playing time in this simple story. What goes unsaid, but could be implied here about Maravich, is that Pete's father (Press) shared his ascent in basketball until he signed in the NBA. After that, he was literally on his own. He was so ahead of his time that there was resistance to him and un-cooperation from team mates and officials and media. Without saying explicitly, the NBA resistance/reaction to Pete was symbolized in the high-school try-out depicted in this story. The objection to Pete's flamboyant style and salary limited his impact because Press, his father, could no longer be his coach/protector. The treatment of Maravich and Kareem Jabbar by the press and players was a blatant contrast; (of the two, only Jabbar assaulted another player blindly with his karate punch) . Like in this story, Pete was told too often to 'play basics' i.e. move the ball to the tall, slower ""brothers."" There was little reciprocation. To Maravich's credit, he played team ball for several years and found a way to raise all his stats slowly and leave the NBA game with his head high. Realizing a decade later how Pete Maravich's 'showtime' style was beyond the reach of his contemporaries, the NBA placed him in their Hall of Fame without personally achieving a team championship. Be that as it may, Pete Maravich was accorded the same ill-treatment as a southerner (LSU) that Happened to an equally gifted football player, Billy Cannon, a decade earlier.(both forced to play for weak teams) Remarkably, both endured the slings and arrows to excel in their sport.  This is a great re-creation of Pete Maravich's youth and bond with his father, Press, leaving out the great contributions of his father as a player and war aviator. The testimony as a special feature by Pete Maravich shortly before he passed away only enlarges this athlete's legacy as a peerless shooter and ball handler.",1450483200,6,2624,4.9908675799086755

When I saw that it was available on Blu-ray for about the same price as the DVD I thought ""Sure, it's worth an extra buck"".  I'm pretty sure the video transfer comes right from the VHS copy because the quality is awful!  More video noise than any movie I've ever seen (and that is a lot).

According  to people who was around him at the time his father pushed him extremely hard (beyond the norm). This movie made it look like it was pete's desire to become a basketball  machine.  He actually wanted friends and a normal life as a child. Exploring  that area would have made it a better movie. This disc comes with extras.  Pete speaking live.  He became very spiritual before his death.  After basically walking away from basketball, a wounded warrior, physically and emotionally, he had a burning desire to play again in the rec league.  His last words to his friends during a pick up game was ""I feel great"". Within a minute he fell dead.

3329796,1,B0012QHUB8,"I don't understand all of the positive reviews on this movie. I purchased it based upon the reviews on Amazon, but here is what I found:
1. The acting was subpar, it had a low budget feel to it, from the dialogue to the ridiculous basketball sequences of him maneuvering around kids twice his size. the speed at which he moved made this whole thing very unbelievable.
2. The overall message sent through this film is disturbing. The father was obsessive and arrogant about his sons talent and the push for him to be a professional player. The son had an unhealthy focus on basketball only. Is this really what we want to teach our children?- If nothing else this movie is an example of what is rampant today in families- sports is a God and kids are submitted to ""olympiad"" like training regimines and weekends spent traveling from tournament to tournament.
3. The father was not a very good example of loving his wife. At one point he's sitting at his kitchen table with a bunch of grown men talking about how much he knows about basketball and how great his son is- his wife interrupts him and he tells her something is burning in the kitchen- she replies that she is not cooking and he tells her to go cook something.
4. This movie is supposedly marketed by ""christian"" organizations and books stores, but there is absolutely zero christian content in the whole movie. Pete at some point became a christian and there is a short special feature on it, but there are no christian values in this movie. In fact they are the opposite of what christianity is about. We are to have no God above Him- but in this movie- BASKETBALL and the dream of playing basketball is all but jammed down our throats....",1389744000,2,1701,4.525974025974026
