A few songs in the film but they are done in the right places,ect Jamming with friends, Singing to the little girl, or leading the folk mass. I see Elvis very comfortable in the role, and the rest of the support cast is excellent also. The best scene which shows excellent acting skills with all the actors is the Rage reduction scene. Forget most of the dreadful 60's Elvis musicals before this. This one had a very good story, light comedy, and some good music. And is realistic. Nicely done.",1511654400,,586,4.485981308411215

This very credible albeit low budget little drama had a very slow start in 1970. This fan , buying his new records at the time , was unaware it was even released! It's been written it had no distribution in England .
The excitement of the 1968 TV special , new million sellers , and a grand *stage * comeback in Las Vegas , made this seem small potatos .
Too bad so many people missed the chance to watch Elvis ""do it right "", act and sing occasionally , not every 9 minutes .
The ""ghetto Doctor"" coincided somewhat with his 1969 million seller ""in the ghetto"" and too bad this element went straight to the ether , as well.
Nice to watch Mary Tyler Moore and ed asner in a flick made just before the legendary Mary Tyler Moore series began . Ed played w Elvis as far back as 1961 and that is  another cool backstory .
The socially conscious movie itself is very dated and has some embarrassing stereotypes but at the time was fairly consistent with many new hip tv shows and movies . Hollywood , now going on ""fumes"", as the independents were about to run the show, delivered some entertaining and relevant pieces and Change of Habit , stands proudly alongside .
I think it should have been presented as a ""Made for TV"" and it would have guy in that continuum mentioned above . Should have been Comeback TV Special, Comeback Movie, Comeback on Stage.
Elvis did his most *acting* since Follow That Dream , Wild in the Country, Flaming Star , and he is fully convincing .
A little sad for the fans that Moore panned the movie.
Casual fans will also want to sit through the whole movie - not the usual situation .
Note: unlisted song is ""lawdy, miss clawdy"" , an instrumental played live by Elvis!",1488067200,,1699,4.326018808777429

1191003,4,B0000065M3,"Nice Elvis film, good Mary Tyler Moore too. Surprised by skimpy outfits, adult themes, etc. with the G rating. Touches on some issues of social justice, racial prejudices, and mental illness and autism. Surprising coverage in a seemingly light hearted showcase for Elvis and music. Don't look for accuracy in the celebration of the Mass though. Some of the rules for Mass are not negotiable (well they aren't supposed to be anyway - you get renegades in any ""arena"" and the Church is certainly no exception).",1486080000,3,508,4.9186046511627906

1191005,4,B0000065M3,"Next to Jailhouse Rock, this is probably my second favorite Elvis film. While most of Elvis' films were obviously made to boost record sales, I wish this movie would've been a straight non-musical film. Maybe universal can make an alternate cut? I know, I know, my suggestion is sacrilege, but by today's standards it comes across as hokey. Plus, it'd be nice to see two different versions on the same blu-ray of this and other films where the musical parts would only be kept when crucial to the story.

Anyway, this needs to be on Blu-ray and hopefully it will now that Mary Tyler Moore has passed.",1485907200,,600,4.607476635514018

1191018,4,B0000065M3,"Not as fun as other Elvis movies.  Not the typical formula (which I like).  A much more serious attempt by Elvis and his management crew at movie making.  With all that being said....I didn't like it quite as much.  Although Elvis has talent...he just isn't a Marlon Brando or Robert De Niro type of actor.  I much prefer the more humorous romps like Viva La Vegas, Spinout and Tickle Me which include a few songs, a fist fight, some laughs, and lots of attractive women.  It's what we call ""box office.""

1191048,3,B0000065M3,"First, for an Elvis movie, this is pretty good.  Decent character development, and the plot is ok.  The acting is good, MTM of course was always a great actress, but even Elvis did good here.  When I was a teen I would have given this movie five stars; but now that I have matured, and grown in Faith, I SEE the message contained in the movie, which basically made a mockery of nuns, disrespecting the wearing of the habit as being undesirable, made it seem like renouncing one;s solemn vows to play street activist is a good and moral choice, while it is REALLY mortally sinful, and ending with the two old ladies wishing for the old days ""Where they didn't have to think: was incredibly spiteful ugly and dishonest evaluation of the glorious Latin Tridentine Mass.  It is actually an anti-Catholic movie, meant to make the watering down of the Faith seem alright.  Subtle, not overt anti-Catholicism.  Meant to woo one, not hit over the head with a sledge hammer.  A kind of ""cultrual jihad"" if you will.  So, good acting and decent plot aside, watch it with your eyes wide open, and do not get suckered into the anti-Catholic sentiment in the movie.",1471824000,,1152,4.585365853658536

The only thing I find strange is how this movie got a G rating from the MPAA. I guess the ratings board figured that it's an Elvis movie and slapped a G rating on it without watching it.

1191127,4,B0000065M3,"This is a very good movie.  It is not the ""win the race, get the girl"" formula that Hollywood put Elvis in.  By the way some of those movies made him physically ill as he read the scripts.  Elvis always wanted to be a serious actor and critics thought he really could have been and very good following his rolls in ""Love Me Tender"", ""Jailhouse Rock"", and ""King Creole"".  Hollywood knew that if it said ""Elvis Presley"" it would sell so they didn't bother getting good scripts.

Elvis Plays a doctor in a free clinic in Chicago.  He was coming off his ""68' Comeback Special"" and in the best shape of his life and in a good mood.  You can feel that with his performance in this one.  Mary Tyler Moore co-stars as a nun who, with 2 of her ""sisters"" goes undercover in the poor district to better help the people there.  Elvis and Mary have a good connection but Elvis doesn't know she is a nun so he becomes interested in her.  The other part of the plot . . . There is a loan shark that many of the poor people are in debt to which puts them in danger.

There are a few songs in this one but not like the usual ""musicals"" Elvis was in.  Very entertaining movie with good acting and decent plot.  Ed Asner also has a roll in this and this movie precedes ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" which put them together on the small screen.",1433462400,5,1322,4.15748031496063

My thoughts changed after seeing this movie. I remember watching it a long time ago and it resonated with me. I had the chance to see it again a few days ago and discovered my feelings hadn't changed about it. I loved Elvis in this movie and I loved ""Rubberneckin'"". He showed a great range of acting in this film that made me a believer and he was quite handsome to watch. I wish he had more opportunities to show us his acting chops rather than the crap he was forced to do to earn a buck. That was a downright shame and a waste of his great talent.
Too bad that movie was the last one he did. Put your preconceived notions aside about what you know of Elvis and see this movie, your minds will be changed just like the habits the title suggest. Enjoy the movie!",1382486400,,939,4.136612021857924

1191292,4,B0000065M3,"I first saw this film at the age of 12, in the age of Dialing for Dollars (Janis Joplin, anyone?) Strangely enough, ""Elvis Week"" played before Elvis was dead. The Beatles were the week before. I fell in love with both.

I am now pushing 50 and I still love my Beatles and Elvis movies. I must have seen ""Change of Habit"" 50 times since I was a kid, and the more I see it, the better I like it. It is true some parts are ridiculous, including my pet beef that the nuns are wearing make-up, specifically eye-shadow, in the convent, prior to being ""released"" into the general population. I consider criticisms such as this ""chump change"" -- the kind of thing I can accept as long as the ""premise"" of the movie is reliable.

Serious critics can pick apart many ""credibility"" moments in this movie. Much might appear ""dated."" But for me, I look for the ""soul"" of the movie; the serious intent of the characters -- and the actors behind the characters -- who put their soul into this movie to put forth ideals in ways they were not allowed in their mainstream professional lives.

Elvis (privately) rated this one of the best movies he'd ever done, but, because it was his last movie and was not backed by a soundtrack, was considered by Col. Parker a failure, and therefore did not ""exist"" as a record of accomplishment financially or through social impact. People who ""study"" Elvis know he never cared about the ""bottom line"" dollar-wise; he always cared about people. In this movie, it shows.

Lastly, and this may be a ""technical"" point, but this is the only movie I've ever seen that even remotely deals with what was called the Ecumenical Movement. I am not Catholic, or religious, but it seems to be that this movie takes on even a sliver of social and human rights issues that were taking place in the late 1960s that really weren't addressed at all until prior to the turn of the century, and is poised to be an issue under the current Papal administration, as I write this.

This movie is not for everybody. Some people would say that ""only people who love Elvis would care about this movie."" I can honestly say I never cared about Elvis until I saw this movie.",1379721600,4,2165,4.470886075949367

I don't know that Elvis and Mary Tyler Moore are the best match - the chemistry doesn't seem to really be there - but Elvis is really good in this movie and it has an important message to it.

1191369,1,B0000065M3,"Other than the fact that this movie has ""Rubberneckin'"" in it, there is nothing to recommend it beyond that.  It's offensive in its stereotypes (Elvis utters, ""The last 3 nurses that worked here couldn't take it.  Two of them got raped.  One even against her will."")  Perhaps, at the time, it was meant to be funny, but time has revealed every flaw of this movie and made it utterly irrelevant.  It's very obviously shot on a backlot and not in NY which, at the time, would have added a gritty realism to this saggingly artificial film.

In many ways it reminded me of ""Sister Act"" except that ""Sister Act"" was a comedy and everyone was ""in on the joke"".  This movie would have us believing that autism can be cured by hugs in one office visit.  Mary Tyler Moore is her usual self...playing a bit uptight but well-intentioned.  Elvis, if it weren't WIDELY known before this movie, is no actor.  He delivers the lines in this film as casually and ""throw-away"" as he would deliver a line about a coconut in Hawaii.

1191371,1,B0000065M3,"I have been a fan of Elvis Presley's music since the King hit like a bomb in the mid-1950s. I bought all his early 45s and then the LPs, and by now have collected the best CD masterings of all his good songs (not the movie filler).

Some of his movies were mildly entertaining fluff (Follow That Dream, Kid Galahad); some were talky bores (Wild in the Country, Love Me Tender, King Creole); and Blue Hawaii spawned a dozen copycat color travelogues with thin plots and often thinner songs. In many of his movies, it was obvious that the producers couldn't decide whether they were presenting an actor or a singer. Eventually, Elvis sank to making sitcom-level, low-budget dreck like Kissin' Cousins and Harum Scarum.

""Change of Habit"" is perhaps Elvis' worst movie: a shallow, confused, clich&eacute;-ridden, cardboard attempt to be ""relevant."" Virtually every scene is sickeningly bad, and that is coming from a lifelong admirer of Elvis Presley's talent.

I guess the movies made a lot of money, but overall they were a detriment to the man's career. Thirty-five years after his death, his star still shines bright, but it might have been brighter had he never made a single movie.",1326240000,5,1184,4.851485148514851

The chemistry between him and Mary Tyler Moore is great and believable and the story, itself, is a great story of 3 nuns who move into a neighborhood incognito (no one knows their nuns) to make a difference in the lives of the people and the neighborhood.  They work for a local doctor played by Elvis (who also does not know they are nuns) and the story revolves around their impact in the neighborhood and the lives of the people around them.  It is also a romantic story in the evolving relationship between Mary Tyler Moore's character and Elvis' character.

I mean, there they were, locked up nice and cozy in the convent and because of the Church's project to service the poor, must remove the habit and ""fit in"" society.  Sister Irene particularly was struggling had finally left the religious life.  At the end, Sister Michelle had to decide to get married or stay in the convent and take her final vows.

I mean I saw him in ""Blue Hawaii"", when it first came out and I was all alone in a huge theatre. Not because the movie was bad, but because I went early on a weekday when everyone was at work and I was just a kid. It cost me a whole half dollar! *(50 Cents!!!) That was a lot back then, especially to a kid! I used to play hookey from school and hide under our steps after buying potato chips, ice-cream, chocolate milk and some candy, all for about 25 cents!!! Maybe a little more than that, but not much! The truant officer never found me! lol Times were great, back then! At least to a child. I had no clue we were on the brink of distruction, bought on by the election of the Kennedy clan, who are the ones who really distroyed America. *(Ted with his ""1965 NEW Immigration policy"" that opened the flood gates to the terd-3rd world and open border fiasco we see today!!!) Anyway, this movie was a reminder of hippie-liberal times that turned the nation away from traditional values to the new anything goes era. It's nice to see Mary young again too! Who ever would have thought she'd be on Elvis' hot babe list?!! I miss the nuns of yesteryear in their habits, especially the ones at St Anthony's and the large hats of St Vincent de Paul nuns. Now you have slave women walking around in burkas all over the place instead!!! Not Christian nuns! The world's upsidedown! Thanks a lot, brain dead Ted! The murderer and blood sucking leech of the Senate that road into politics on the coattails of death and prospered much ever since! This movie brings back times of chaos and soul searching. Finding out who we were and changing times of very selfish people. We could have done without the songs in the film though. I do recommend this movie.

This is unfortunate as had this movie been made near the start of his film career (say after'Blue Hawaii') I think it would have become one of his fans most liked films. The story has a slight edge to it - set in an inner city, tough neighbourhood where a group of nuns has been sent to work with the local doctor, Elvis. Presley looks terrific, lean and mean. No outstanding songs but at the end as he sings a mock gospel the camera pans across a statue of Christ on the cross then moves to Elvis, blasphemous or simple coincidence?

Yet, Presley obviously felt the seasoned Moore (versus his standard gallery of vacuous starlets) would give him credibility as a more serious actor in a film that dealt with social issues albeit in a most unbelievable manner.

Directed in journeyman TV-movie fashion by William A. Graham, the contrived story concerns three nuns, undercover as nurses in civilian clothing, who are sent on a mission to an inner city neighborhood to help the groovy Dr. John Carpenter, who runs a free clinic there when he's not singing and playing his guitar. Complications ensue as each sister finds it difficult to assimilate themselves into the community no thanks to a belligerent local pastor against their mission from the outset. The giggly Sister Barbara attempts to confront the local grocer to change his price-gouging ways, while the sullen Sister Irene feels conflicted about being a black woman amid the racial inequity of the real world. Sister Michelle, however, has the most palpable dilemma - should she remain faithful to the church or succumb to the charms of the doctor? If any of this could be taken seriously, there might have been a chance toward a grittier examination of social services to the marginalized. In an effort to stay topical, there is a discomfiting rape scene and an oversimplified treatment for autism called Rage Reduction.

But all this effort is secondary since this is Elvis after all, and he has no facility as an actor to play anyone but himself. With his aggressive sideburns and skintight white jeans with matching shoes, he does not slip into any character that would be credibly living in the ghetto. However, he does sing four songs, of which only ""Rubberneckin'"" is worthy of a second listen. As Sister Michelle, Moore is overly earnest without her trademark irony - the Mary we love only shows up briefly during a touch football scene in the park. Singer Barbara McNair, deglamorized and barely cracking her famous smile, plays Sister Irene, while future soap opera villainess Jane Elliot plays Sister Barbara. Look for Ed Asner playing a progressive cop but sadly no scenes with Moore are offered. The only noteworthy extra on the 2002 DVD is the original theatrical trailer.

We're also cruelly tantalized by the lovely Barbara McNair as--you guessed it--Mary's foxy-nun nurse-buddy, Sister Irene.  None of the Sisters at MY Catholic school looked as good as these two.

So we have Sr. Michelle who tries to naively help the troubled youth, Sr. Irene who comes to terms with her ownself as she learns how to beat the Banker & help her people & young Sr. Barbara - the young rebel, who learns how to fight the tough battle while staying in tune with the neighborhood people.  Elvis has the role of Dr John Carpenter, a calm voice in a sea of turmoil. He knows there's trouble in the streets, he's there to help those he can, get involved when necessary & help where he can.  He doesn't have any illusions of being the superhero.  Actually Elvis seems to have walked in off the street onto the movie set he is so lowkeyed.  He appears to be having fun, relaxed & even gets to play football.  He does sing - 4 songs if you include the title track.  One song at the beginning where he & the neighborhood kids are just hanging out & jamming, & one at the end - a gospel song in church.

1191431,4,B0000065M3,"This movie is enjoyable if flawed (holding a child for 8 hours straight won't cure autism).  Elvis as Dr. Dreamboat is gorgeous, (despite mutton chops) I just wish that MTM as Sister Michelle wasn't such a quavery nervous wreck.  (and besides, she looks like a chipmunk in her full habit at the end). Elvis is very natural with the mediocre dialogue, a shame that he was under the thumb of his manager and didn't get more dramatic roles, he surely could have handled them.  (Check out Jailhouse Rock for a comparison)

 Watching this while I was growing up, I hoped that Sr. Michelle would choose the doctor over the church, (which we are frustratingly left to figure out ourselves). But now I think his character would have been happier with the nun who definitely leaves in the end!

 If not the best written Elvis movie (with stereotypes and heavy handed messages galore) at least it's nice to see him in a dramatec role.  It meant well as a commentary on the times, it just needed a bit more fine tuning.  The opening 'striptease' by the nuns (they change from habits to streetclothes) certainly sends a mixed message and some might say a sacriligious one too, but for the most part, it's just immature and a bit ridiculous.

It has much to say about religion, racial tensions,  morality, individual choice, etc. In a way, it's a time capsule for those of us who were growing up in the turbulent 60's and early 70's. The very idea that Mary Tyler Moore chose to follow her conscience instead of a ""groovy"" young doctor is amazing in itself.

(Then again, Frank Sinatra once played a Catholic priest.) Three happening nuns--Mary Tyler Moore, Jane Elliot and Barbara McNair--venture out into the Real World and it doesn't take long before horny Puerta Rican men with drinking problems try to feel them up.

He fidgets around in every scene, like he can't wait for the director to yell ""Cut-Print"" so he can horse around with his Memphis Mafia. It's the usual Presley screen persona, surly, unpleasant, condescending, peeved at every little thing. (Hardly acting, Elvis hated these movies.) Elvis would tell MTM that she was the first of his leading ladies he never shacked up with. (One thing's for certain, though, their hair dye came out of the same bottle.) There's some ludicrous symbolism involved in this turkey. Elvis plays John Carpenter. Get it? JC? John Carpenter? Jesus Christ? Jesus was a carpenter? Jesus was the King? So was the Man from Memphis? Cough-cough. Dr. Elvis comes on to Sister Mary Tyler Moore and in the last scene of the movie her gaze goes from Elvis to Jesus to Elvis to Jesus and we're forever left wondering which one she chooses.

Before taking their vows, the novices have been ordered to take a walk on the wild side, late-Sixties style, with all the trite social commentary and mild sexual titillation a G rating will allow. As comely, full-lipped Sister Michelle, MTM joins the short list (with Julie Andrews and Sally Field) for the title of Hollywood's Most Wholesomely Hot Sister. Naturally, El is smitten with her and can't figure out why she would choose a life of poverty, chastity and obedience over his funky world of howlingly cartoonish ethnic stereotypes, perverts and other fun types.
After this one, Elvis had the good sense to rip up his Screen Actors Guild card. Everybody say ""Amen!"" But seriously, it's a shame El's last feature film came a cropper. Buoyed by the success of his 1968 comeback special, the Big E looked fitter, less stoned and more handsome (sideburns notwithstanding) than he had in years. Elvis reportedly valued credibility as a serious actor over his natural gifts as a singer/entertainer. Instead of giving him a challenging role worthy of his born-again confidence, ""Change of Habit"" remains infamous for miscasting Elvis at a time when he was primed and ready to prove himself as an actor. Too bad.
The flick IS watchable for its gallery of familiar faces, among them porcine character actor Robert Emhardt (immortal as blustery businessman Malcolm Tucker in ""The Andy Griffith Show's"" most essential episode, ""Man in a Hurry"") hamming it up as a crime kingpin. And the cop that looks remarkably like Ed Asner really is him. How both Asner and MTM managed to escape from the abyss of one of Elvis's most misguided films, only to achieve nirvana in a certain Minneapolis newsroom just a year later, is impressive and miraculous.
This being one of Presley's ""serious"" movies, the soundtrack is lean, but there is one bizarro musical highlight: a piano-pounding Elvis jamming with MTM, self-consciously fingering a classical guitar like a doe caught in the spotlight, on what sounds like ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy.""

Though it is not a particularly profound film , Change Of Habit does represent a change of pace for Elvis. A drama instead of a comedy, this film featured only three songs. Elvis stars a Dr. John Carpenter, a professional man for the first time in his career. Dr. Carpenter heads a clinic in a ghetto area of a major metropolitan area. He is suprised to be offered assitance by three woman. Unknown to him, the three are nuns in street clothing who are on a ""secret"" mission to aid the community but are afraid the local residents might be reluctant to seek hekp if their true identities were known. Dr. Carpenter falls in love with Sister Michelle Gallagher (Mary Tyler Moore) but her true vocation remains unknown to him. Sister Michelle also has feelings for Dr. Carpenter but is reluctant to leave the order. The film concludes with Sister Michelle entering a church to pray for guidance to make her choice - the church or Dr. Carpenter.
Unfortunately, by this time, Elvis had lost his lack of interest in pursuing a film career and had let his film contracts expire. He was eagerly awaiting his freedom to return to live performances.
It's interesting to note the cast in this film. Mary Tyler Moore who had success in the Dick Van Dyke show and her own series The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Ed Asner who co-stared on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Jane Elliot (Sister Barbara Bennett) is now a well know soap opera star. Darlene Love who was a member of The Blossoms singing group that backed Elvis on his 1968 NBC TV Special and later played Danny Glover's wife in Lethal Weapon plays one of the backup singers in this film.

This comedy/drama has all the right substance for a GOOD movie and if you don't get what the movie is about, that just too bad!",1028073600,4,624,4.12396694214876
1191454,3,B0000065M3,"Elvis plays a hip young doctor helping out the neglected souls living in the ghetto. Mary Tyler Moore is one of a trio of nuns who arrive in plainclothes to work undercover in Elvis' clinic. Much romance and social consciousness ensues, all of it presented so clumsily and wrongheadedly that it sometimes made my jaw drop in disbelief.
A shy romance ensues between Moore and Elvis (who doesn't know that she is a nun), leading to the film's unbelievable concluding scene, in which...
SPOILER!
...Moore returns to the neighborhood's Catholic church. Unlike before, it is now a thriving center of worship led by Elvis singing and playing ""Let Us Pray"" (or something like that) on his guitar. Moore is torn between her vows and her love for Elvis, which is dramatized by cutting between the singing pop icon and the relics of the Catholic church. Elvis...or Jesus? Elvis...or Jesus?
A remarkably simple-minded film. I give it 3 stars because its so bad that it becomes weirdly fascinating.  Don't rent it unless the Ed Wood, Jr. bin of your local video store is empty.",1013990400,3,1065,4.819672131147541
1191455,4,B0000065M3,"If you love Elvis movies, you'll love this one as well!  There isn't much singing in it, so this movie has a more realistic feel to the story than most of Elvis' movies.  This movie proves that you don't have to show explicit sexual scenes to have a thought provoking story.",993600000,13,274,4.352941176470588
1191456,4,B0000065M3,"When I was younger anytime my parents or other adults talked about Elvis movies, what came to mind were lame movies with very little plot, structured in a way so Elvis could sing some ""new"" tunes. My ""mama always used to say that"" Elvis was a better actor than most people believed, but from watching films like BLUE HAWAII, I thought she was just couldn't face the truth that Elvis couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  After seeing CHANGE OF HABIT (and learning more about how Colonel Parker ran the King's life) I realized my Mom was right, Elvis was a decent actor. It's just that he was never allowed many opportunities to display his talent and grow as an actor.  This is unfortunate.
CHANGE OF HABIT is a good movie. It has an interesting plot, most of the characters aren't just paper mache blowing in the wind, and the movie deals with social issues that are still relevant even today.  Many people suggest that Mary Tyler Moore is miscast in this film, but I found her believable in her role as a nun. Also, the supporting cast does a good job given their limited screen time.
As is the case in all Elvis' movies, there are tunes. However, unlike the other Elvis' films I have seen, the movie isn't structured around the songs. The songs that you actually see Elvis singing appear more natural than staged and a couple of them are really memorable, e.g. ""In the Ghetto"".
I haven't seen very many Elvis' films, but out of the ones I have viewed, this is the best.  I wish Elvis would have been allowed to make more films like this. He could have ended up being remembered as much for his acting as his singing and that would have really been a change of habit.",983318400,67,1673,4.4045307443365695
1191457,3,B0000065M3,"While his ""new"" music, including the very important title ""In The Ghetto"", was getting good notice across the world, this socially-conscious movie was in release. Unfortunately, the ""Made For  TV"" quality made this respectable effort a minor work, which did  showcase strong  performances by Presley as an inner city Doctor and by  Mary Tyler Moore as a Nun who wants to try a different approach in a  complex setting. The music is very agreeable and is well interpolated - dig  Elvis on piano (""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy"") and singing along with  Darlene Love (""Rubberneckin'""). The somewhat non-traditional  ""Let Us Pray"" number might suggest the controversial ""gospel  rock"" of future decades. The difficult physical/spiritual theme  warranted more time and attention than was presumeably allowed and perhaps  accounts for the film's lesser-known status.",961027200,13,850,5.461538461538462
