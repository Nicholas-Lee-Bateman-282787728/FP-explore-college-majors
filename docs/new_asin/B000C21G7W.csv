2452510,5,B000C21G7W,Totally awesome............  Every Trailer Park Boy's collector needs this for their own!  Only thing I am not happy with is the shipping my box was crushed a little. But Conkey and the DVD made it without a scratch. Peace to all the Trailer Park Family,1250985600,,253,4.6

Is gathering around the TV for a viewing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Santa/dp/B00020HAB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Santa</a>&nbsp;a Christmas tradition at your house?

If you answered yes, pick up a copy of the The Trailer Park Boys Christmas Special which features Conky, the creepy puppet from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trailer-Park-Boys-The-Complete-Fourth-Season/dp/B0007RO8MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trailer Park Boys: The Complete Fourth Season</a>. This DVD provides a backstory to the main characters.

Canada's mockumentary is a bold, unflinching look at the Sunnyvale Trailer Park, where Julian (John Paul Tremblay), Ricky (Robb Wells) and Bubbles (Mike Smith) hold court while constantly dodging the pseudo-authority of Lahey (John Dunsworth) and Randy (Patrick Roach).

As a Christmas gift, I recommend you start with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trailer-Park-Boys-Season-1-2/dp/B00009KNU5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trailer Park Boys: Season 1-2</a>&nbsp;or try the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trailer-Park-Boys-The-Movie/dp/B0012EBVAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trailer Park Boys - The Movie</a>. Here's the product description for the movie: ""From producer Ivan Reitman comes Trailer Park Boys: The Movie-- a comedy full of drugs, alcohol and strippers.""

In summary, this Christmas special is very funny but you'll enjoy it even more if you've already been introduced to the main characters.",1229299200,4,1677,8.197802197802197
2452513,5,B000C21G7W,"Alot of people don't know about this comedic jem from our friends up Nord, but those of us that do all know if it's Trailer Park Boys ANYTHING then it's a must have.  When the Movie comes out in 2006 you'll get a taste too.  Very funny charactors all- Julian and Ricky are just insane, but it's the rest of the cast that makes this show GREAT.  I completely recommend it to any and all with a sense of the absurd and  those who love Canadien humor.  The best thing out of Canada since RUSH...  (And there is a connection between the two..)",1132704000,5,539,4.184466019417476
2452514,5,B000C21G7W,"I am a diehard Trailer park boys fan and believe me this is one of the funiest episodes ever! We once again are alowed to see J-ROCK as Jaime and see Lahey have his first drink, priceless",1131926400,6,187,4.081081081081081
8095407,1,B000C21G7W,I live in The United States of America in Ohio and I love this facking show! 99.00 bucks is a lot of cash for a conky that doesn't even look like conky! I want a real conky!,1457654400,,173,3.7027027027027026
8095408,5,B000C21G7W,"Terrifically funny and beautifully staged. The scenes with the trailers decorated in lights are beautiful and charming. Mr Lacey's trash bag Santa beard and his appearance in church on Christmas Eve s hysterically funny. You won't believe Randy as an elf. And did you know Barb was responsible for bringing Randy home? Crowbars wrapped as candy canes., Julian's take on Christmas repackagijng, Ricky getting sprung from jail. It's all here watch it. Possibly e best stand alone episode/movie of the whole franchise.",1447718400,,515,5.2926829268292686
8095409,5,B000C21G7W,What a swell addition to my trailer park boys collection. The corky finger puppet alone makes this purchase worthwhile. Watching this every Christmas is going to be a new tradition for me now.,1402444800,,192,4.848484848484849
8095410,5,B000C21G7W,"This movie is a prequel set around a Christmas in Sunnyvale Trailer park. It did a great job of capturing the characters at their humorous best. I have seen every TPB production and I believe that this production was better than most of the other TPB movies, which were not always as good as the TV show. Being a prequel it explains the hilarious background to relationships between several of the characters. Particularly, this film sheds light on the colorful past of the disgraced-policeman-turned-trailer-park-manager/nemesis to the TPBs.",1374105600,,542,5.241379310344827
8095411,2,B000C21G7W,The DVD was thrown into an envelope and crushed by the US postal service.  A little cardboard would have minimized the damage. Not happy with the USPS (it's a given that those monkeys don't care about how the mail is handled) or the seller's choice of packaging.,1288137600,,262,4.574468085106383
8095412,5,B000C21G7W,"Nothing more needed to say, its the Trailer Park Boys!
If you like silly humor, and you don't mind a lot of fowl language, then this is your thing.
I love the Trailer Park Boys! Go Bubbles!",1277424000,,189,4.135135135135135
8095413,3,B000C21G7W,The box was crushed. The disc was ok but the packing was crushed. Maybe they should package it for shipping better. I will say that the service was prompt.,1269734400,,155,4.379310344827586
8095414,5,B000C21G7W,"The Trailer Park Boys are a hoot. You never know what is going to happen next, but you can bet the laughs will never stop. I ordered their complete DVD set and it is a gold mine. If you haven't watched these guys you are missing out.",1269734400,,233,3.978723404255319
8095415,5,B000C21G7W,Received the DVD with puppet (made us laugh) he loved it. Thanks much for the NEW sealed product.,1266105600,,97,4.444444444444445
8095416,5,B000C21G7W,Great movies if you love TPB. Kinda short but funny! Great stocking stuffer! Merry Xmas!!,1259798400,,89,5.0
