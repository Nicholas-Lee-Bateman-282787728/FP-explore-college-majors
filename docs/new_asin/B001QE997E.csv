3764554,5,B001QE997E,"This is a very solid instructional video from Cherry Lane --Featuring Danny Gill. It has four songs (Mr. Crowley, Crazy Train, Revelation (Mother Earth) and I Don't Know) off the first album Blizzard of Ozz and four songs (Dairy of a Madman, You Can't Kill Rock and Roll, Flying High Again, Little Dolls) off the second album Dairy of a Madman which Randy co-wrote and played. So you have you Five out of the Six songs Randy considers his favorite songs from these two albums, the Sixth being ""Over the Mountain"" which I felt should have been in there myself (my choice would be to have it over ""I Don't Know""). The Five other songs are, if your curious, ""Revelation, Mr Crowley, Dairy, Flying High Again, Rock and Roll"" which were his favorites.

It does have 2 DVD's and the running time is 4 hrs and 48mins. I was taking a gamble with this order because it has the wrong description for this item from Amazon. Danny goes through each song showing you in moderate musically terms, the rhythms and leads fully for each song. Having said that, if you are a Beginner to Intermediate player this will be good for you if you are disciplined enough to learn these songs all the way through off of this DVD. He does go slow enough to learn each bar and phrase of the song. If you are Intermediate to Excellent player you should have no problem with the musically terms and the fact that there are NO Tabs.

It does NOT show On-Screen Tablature of what Danny is doing but, if you have the Tab books from Cherry Lane of these albums&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ozzy-Osbourne-Blizzard-of-Ozz-Play-It-Like-It-Is/dp/157560437X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ozzy Osbourne - Blizzard of Ozz (Play-It-Like-It-Is)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ozzy-Osbourne-Diary-of-a-Madman/dp/1575600137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ozzy Osbourne - Diary of a Madman</a>&nbsp;you can follow through that way too. (NOTE: only 95% of what Danny does and the Tab books correspond exactly, The 5% you can decide which way you want to play it). I like to have both Visual and Written to learn if I can so these books will help alot.

The only thing I didn't care for was Danny's fingering on some chords, he makes it harder than it needs to be ---Expl. on Dairy.

Good Luck and Keep Rocking !!!!

8335405,5,B001QE997E,"THis is one of the few dvd's that I come over and over to, since Danny Gill, is not only a very ""articulate"" teacher, but also a very good player..It seems as if he is in your living room with you,one on one,  and not, as other teachers, appear to be reading off a board someplace. If ALL the notes are correct or not, I really don't know, since I'm not a Randy Rhoads expert, but the sound and the playing are one of a kind..the sound is very good, and Danny goes through every song phrase by phrase, and note per note.  There is no tab, not even on the screen, but because of the style in teaching, there is almost no need for it...athere are two camera angles, the fretting hand is bigger, and the picking hand , smaller, so one can see what's going on with the picking hand.  If Randy is your hero, buy this dvd...",1365811200,4,818,4.1
8335406,5,B001QE997E,"Getting great education from this.
Helps so much if you take the time and slowly go over each note.
Diary is the best song of all time.
Just try and play it and understand what a mind wrote those notes.
Nobody does this kind of music writing.",1361491200,,242,4.170212765957447
8335407,5,B001QE997E,"This is THE best video out there to learn these songs!  Danny Gill does an excellent job presenting the material, and his playing is superb.  I would HIGHLY recommend this video to those interested in learning these classic songs!",1342396800,,230,4.871794871794871
8335408,5,B001QE997E,"This dvd is great. Over four hours of instruction. I was going to give 4-stars, because there is no tab, but it really is not needed. Danny Gill does such an excellent job of explaining every single phrase that i feel 5-stars are warranted. there are no backing tracks or band demos, just him sitting and playing through the songs and breaking down every bar. If interested in Rhoads' technique this certainly is a great investment in my opinion.",1314403200,2,446,4.658227848101266
8335409,3,B001QE997E,"The subject matter was very good and presented well, but because it wouldn't play in our portable DVD player, we had to mess with formatting a new DVD, etc. Which was a pain!",1295049600,3,174,4.303030303030303
