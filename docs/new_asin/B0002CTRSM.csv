8448274,2,B0002CTRSM,"First off let me say when buying a video from BOOZ Ent you basically know what your going to see, a black version of girls gone wild. This is the kind of stuff BET should've had on BET uncut.
There is only one way to describe this DVD, biggest let down ever. I decided to buy this Dvd after seeing a preview of it on another BOOZ Ent video, and thought it would be a little more explicit. To my surprise it was all censored. Nothing but blue dots and fuzzy shots. I spent most of my time fast forwarding.
Most of BOOZ's movies I've seen aren't this censored, maybe there is a uncensored version somewhere, but if there is this is not it. Bottom line only get this DVD if you're certain it is uncut & uncensored.",1285718400,,711,4.159420289855072
8448275,1,B0002CTRSM,"This DvD shows how wack rappers really are. It is a poor attempt of rhyming skills and a poor attempt of live performing. The only good thing about the DvD is that they had strippers at their live performance and that is not even saying that much. Most of them looked beat up and tired. I was even more shocked that ""Booz"" and ""June Dox"" was even apart of such a horrible DvD. I am a big fan of ""Booz Entertainment"" and this was just horrible.",1120262400,2,443,4.162790697674419
