8643160,5,B00IKVSMII,"I just have to watch this every few years so decided to just buy myself a copy. Vincent Price at his campy best and I LOVE the ball scene. Roger Corman shouldn't have been so cheap and should have hired more extras for that scene because the rooms look too empty. Other than that,perfection.",1530057600,,291,4.407407407407407
8643161,5,B00IKVSMII,"Excellent copy of Masque of the Red Death paired with a good copy of Madhouse (there was a longish glitch in a scene but without loss of dialogue or action).

Masque has been a favorite of mine since childhood.  Not as campy as most Vincent Price flicks, it tells a medieval morality tale in a convincingly medieval setting.  The excellent costumes occasionally advance the plot as do certain colors.

Madhouse, in contrast, offers an exceedingly campy retrospective of Price's numerous horror films.  I'd never seen it before and was pleasantly surprised.  I don't know how enjoyable it would be, however, without familiarity with the previous movies.",1509235200,,652,5.10377358490566
