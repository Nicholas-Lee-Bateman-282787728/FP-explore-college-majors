7306985,5,B010BCBI02,"It is estimated that only 44% of Americans now believe in the Second-Coming of Christ, the time that in the twinkling of an eye His believers will.be called up into Heaven to spend their Eternity with Him. When I was growing up in the 70's, it was more like 75%.of Americans believed in a Second-Coming  We've moved away from God, not the other way around.  The Second-Coming of Christ will still happen with or without our belief.  We don't need to walk around in sack-cloth & ashes to identify one's self as a Christian.  Instead, behaving as a Christian does.  Avid church-goers who numbly sit in a pew Sunday after Sunday does not a Christian make. Considering how unprepared as a country we were for something as horrific as Hurricane Katrina, the vacancy of vital roles in the electronic, emergency, and justice system due to the RAPTURE is beyond frightening.  Homeland security has prepared for hurricanes, floods, riots, and yes, even Zombie attacks, but not the Rapture, because that involves the three-letter word, G-O-D, an entity that the government is trying very hard to eliminate.  This video examines how, and if, we can prepare.",1466121600,8,1146,4.876288659793815

8721743,5,B010BCBI02,"Only issue I have. I thought most of them were afraid to say what the Bible says about children. God is about love,BUT! Children who would make it would be the ones sanctified by believing parents. Remember God knows the hearts whereas man does not. How many stories are told about God knowing the heart of a child? David comes to mind. How about in the old Testament where it states God hated the one child who was a King, if I recall correctly God did not even allow his body to be buried like his other family members. Unbelieving parents I believe their children will stay with them and the real believers children will go with them to be with the Lord. Other than that great gathering of all these wonderful Pastors!",1527292800,,721,4.428571428571429

8721745,1,B010BCBI02,"""According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who remain until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first, those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.""

8721747,1,B010BCBI02,"These type of films/documentaries are quite misleading... The Rapture of the Church and the return of Christ are the same event... Non-denominational Christians who have subscribed to the American Dispensationalism ideas of the likes of the TDS are behind this wrong expectation of the Rapture of the Church... Films such ""left behind"" and so forth, are a misrepresentation of the Rapture of the Church and are unscriptural. Scripture can not be any clearer as we see in Matthew 24:29, and logically, the Church professes a much different view in the Rapture than those subscribing to American Dispensationalism: Per Matthew 24:29, The Church militant is to be raptured upon the Lord's return after the great tribulation; do not be deceived by American Dispensationalism... Not a single person to be here in such days will ever be spared from the great tribulation.  'Wrath' and 'Tribulation' are different words with different meanings. The Lord spares the faithful from His wrath, but not from tribulation...
