8437991,4,B004QC6HFU,Comprehensive review of Grossman's career and expose' on his guitar techniques. Enjoyed the reference to his iconic mentors.,1407801600,,124,5.944444444444445
8437992,5,B004QC6HFU,"Stefan Grossman, the owner of Vestapol Video, has been releasing a series of ""The Artistry of..."" videos for years. These ""Artistry of..."" vids  present as talented guitar player describing their career with performance footage of the musician (sometimes new; sometimes archival) inserted throughout the program. (Most run about 90 minutes.). I've enjoyed the other volumes in this series (which has included David Bromberg and Bert Jansch or instance). Now, Grossman - a Brooklynite who started playing in Greenwich Village in thwe early 1960s and became a protge of the legendary Rev. Gary Davis - has turned the spotlight on himself for this new release. And it's about time! Grossman - who also releases videos of guitar lessons - is a great raconteur and tells some great stories during the 155-minute (that's over 2  hours!) program. We hear about Greenwich Village, his time with the Even Dozen Jug Band and his 20 years living in Britain and Europe. There are over 35 songs performed between his engaging monologues. These come from various times and places with BBC TV appearances from the 1970s, American TV performances from the 1960s to 1996. There's Grossman in Sweden in 1972 and 1974 and San Francisco in 1995. They performances are not chronological but you can tell the approximate year by the length of Grossman's hair. And, on a few of the performances Grossman is accompanied by John Renbourn of - among other groups - The Pentangle.

My only regret on the DVD is that the dates and locations of the performances are not displayed, even, briefly on the screen. For this info you need to put the DVD into your PC and open up the .pdf of the companion booklet to find this info. It's there; it just takes some work.

BUT, when you do open up that .pdf file you are in for a big surprise - especially if you are a musician, which I'm not. The booklet is a whopping 87 pages (!) and not only as an essay about Grossman, and three pages on the performances, but there are the tablatures for all the songs. This guy believe in education and packs in a lot on this DVD.

If, like me, you can't play a lick (pun intended!), you'll still enjoy this DVD. Grossman's narrative is interesting and there are chapter stops so you can play just the performances on future viewing.

Great volume to anyone into acoustic guitar music.

8437993,5,B004QC6HFU,"The ""Artistry"" series of DVDs is an intimate look at the music of some of the acoustic guitar artists that includes personal stories and interesting anecdotes.  It's an enjoyable series (see review on El McMeen)

This is a bit different.

This has the same format as the others, with wonderful (and historical) performances by Stefan Grossman, peppered with stories of growing up, playing with friends, early contact with Bob Dylan, and stories of taking lessons with Rev. Gary Davis.

Grossman comes across natural, warm, humble, yet still enthusiastic for the music.  The camera work is easy on the eye, nice changes and angles; this is now standard for the ""Artistry"" series of DVDs.

Yet this DVD, in particular, is instructional.

Of course, the others are too, by virtue of having the sample of excellence, yet the generous inclusion of the TAB (embedded on the DVD:  put in your computer and print out) is a great additional benefit, especially since Grossman is one of America's premier guitar teachers (see my reviews on his instructional DVDs).

This is an excellent source of entertainment watching a gifted guitarist, but it is another teaching tool for the budding acoustic guitarist who loves to learn!  ***** Stars!",1301616000,,1230,5.044554455445544
