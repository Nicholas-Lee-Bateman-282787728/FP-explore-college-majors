8566315,5,B00BCP83SI,I chose this video for a small group and was really impressed by the different take for presenting the gospel of Luke. Can't wait to do another by Card.,1473552000,,152,4.275862068965517

8566318,4,B00BCP83SI,"The presenter Michael Card brings us through Rome, Galilee, Jordan River and Jerusalem to introduce the person of Luke and person of Jesus.

It presents many though provoking questions about the person of Jesus - who he was and what he taught. Overall its quite well presented in small segment over 8 lessons.

Unforutunately the pace is rather slow.",1388016000,,350,4.915254237288136
8566319,4,B00BCP83SI,"Quite a good presentation.  I believe anyone who wishes to further explore Luke's representation of the Gospels would find this worthy of the time spent viewing it.  I will get into discussion on this later.  I've completed a four-year lay theology course offered by The Episcopal Church through The University of the South's School of Theology, and went back recently to participate again in the New Testament year (34-weeks, 2.5 hours a week), my favorite year with this program.  There are many Bibles and many translations and even more offering their versions of what Gospel and Bible readings' messages are to us.  This provides information for a more informed view.  Everything can be improved upon, and my mind falls within that description...so I have found this thought-provoking.  I leave it up to other viewers to form their own opinions. For the love of God, it was produced and in that spirit, it should be received.",1385510400,2,930,4.961290322580645
