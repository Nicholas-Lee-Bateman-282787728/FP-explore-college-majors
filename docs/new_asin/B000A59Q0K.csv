8074568,5,B000A59Q0K,"Wow! This is a knockout package with three of his greatest concerts from the old days and one of the greatest liner notes I have ever read describing a talent by pop culture icon Bill Zehme. To see Lewis decades ago and now seeing his new ""Bundle of Nerves"" box set out now would be the best surprise under any Xmas tree or Menorah to make any one you love feel grateful they are who they are and not Lewis!",1416787200,2,407,4.1
8074569,5,B000A59Q0K,"I have been a Richard Lewis fan for years.  If you are a fan and have no DVD's, only casssette or CD recordings, this DVD is just for you.  If you are not a fan yet, Richard Lewis is from the old school of neurotic NY comics like Woody Allen and George from Seinfeld, whose character mimicked Woody Allen down to every gesture.  If that sounds interesting, then you must get this.  If you are from Muskogee, Oklahoma and don't 'cotton' to that stuff, that's cool.  This 'ain't for you.",1292457600,3,485,4.344444444444444
8074570,5,B000A59Q0K,"My husband and I were newly married and in our twenties when Richard Lewis became wildly popular in the 1980's.  He was our favorite comedian and actor.  We enjoyed his stand-up act and his appearances on talk shows.  We were avid fans of his show with Jamie Lee Curtis, ""Anything But Love.""
My husband recently had a birthday and I went through the usual angst about what to give him as a worthy gift.  I came across Richard Lewis's DVD, ""Concerts from Hell-The Vintage Years"" and knew this would please my husband very much.  We have enjoyed every moment of the DVD collection of Richard Lewis' stand-up.  It makes us laugh out loud, it brings to light all over again the brilliant, intelligent humor of Richard Lewis, and it reminds us of the great fun we had watching Richard Lewis in our early marriage.
The DVD is packed with great features.  The commentaries by Robin Williams, Rob Reiner, Billy Crystal and other comedy legends, all when they were young and fresh, is marvelous to see.  The recent interviews with Richard Lewis in which he describes his earlier comedy experiences and who he worked with are wonderful.  Thank you, Richard Lewis, for so many years of laughs and entertainment.  My husband and I feel you are a friend.",1271116800,4,1241,4.67741935483871
8074571,5,B000A59Q0K,"I got this DVD today at the Conan O'Brien late night show, where he was featured, it was the first time that I even heard his name, as I wasn't into comedy, but after listening to him a few minutes I became an instant fan of his, so far I watched the first disk of a set of two, and I was laughing and laughing my way through it..... I must recommend this, buy it and you won't stop laughing.........",1126051200,10,400,4.0125
8074572,5,B000A59Q0K,"I cannot wait for this DVD! I can't curb my enthusiasm--I'm dying! These specials were killer. I saw them while I was in college and they killed me. I remember watching one or two in the student union with hundreds of screaming ""students from hell."" This is really some of the ""vintage"" stuff that put Richard Lewis on the map as one of the greatest and it's about time we can see the origins of his insanity. I know he has plenty of other stuff so hopefully this is just the beginning of loads of comedy DVD's from the Prince of Pain.

Mr. Lewis, I understand you're in recovery and good going for you, but don't get too well! And keep fighting with Larry David on ""Curb""--that show rocks! And you two are like Ali and Frazier!",1120780800,17,728,4.313868613138686
8074573,5,B000A59Q0K,If this 2 DVD set doesn't demonstrate once and for all that Richard Lewis is the spiritual descendent of Lenny Bruce then nothing will. I will be sleepless until the release date and then have a viewing party with my rabbi and a minyon of Jewish men from various countries around the world.,1120780800,14,290,4.490566037735849
