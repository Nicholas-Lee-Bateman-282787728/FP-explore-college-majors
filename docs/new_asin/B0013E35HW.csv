3105168,4,B0013E35HW,"Few men pass the tests of time and scrutiny. Praise will winnow a man's character.
As only the crush of wartime concentration camp can do, Eric Liddell's character came forth like choice oil from the olive press.
It's great to celebrate the goodness of a man's quiet integrity which carried him through both Olympian glory and purgatory.
Don't expect Chariots of Fire cinematography...just real interviews with real people who really knew the man behind the story.",1397692800,3,464,5.118421052631579
3105169,5,B0013E35HW,Some found this account of Eric's life dry because it consisted mostly of interviews.  I found it extremely interesting and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Real and informative if you are interested in the details of Eric's life.,1394496000,,221,5.111111111111111
3105170,5,B0013E35HW,"This story is wonderful. I admire Eric Liddell's courage and conviction. He took a stand for God and he did not shirk his belief and conviction even when people tried to get him to change his mind. If we had pastors and popes with Eric Liddell's steadfast courage,faith and conviction today, oh my what a better world we could have! I Highly Recommend This Movie For Everyone!!!",1390435200,2,378,4.656716417910448
3105171,4,B0013E35HW,"This documentary was of value to us  We all watched and loved ""Chariots of Fire"";  this biography told about the Eric Liddell's life and struggles after the olympics and his continued work in the missionary field in China.  He continued to live what he preached, and that made this DVD something inspiring to watch.",1386460800,,315,4.796296296296297
3105172,2,B0013E35HW,"This is a very factual account of Eric Liddell's life, but there are better accounts out there.  A bit dry to follow.",1352073600,,117,4.318181818181818
3105173,4,B0013E35HW,"If I could arrange it, everyone who experienced ""Chariots of Fire"" would secure a copy of this DVD or a similar media  presentation of Liddell's biography.  So much more than an Olympic class athlete, Liddell was a role model for anyone who wants a life to really matter in this world and into eternity.  His faith, his convictions, his compassion toward others and his motivation led to a life and death that had a profound impact then, and still hold power to inspire us today.  My only complaint is the sometimes erratic audio level(s) sometimes evident in interviews included.  The positives, however, far outweigh the weakness.  I am very glad that I bought ""Eric Liddell: Champion of Conviction.""",1348444800,,702,4.906779661016949
3105174,5,B0013E35HW,"I love the movie CHARIOTS OF FIRE, and always wondered about the real person who was Eric Liddell.  A few years ago, I tried to find a biography of him in my public library, and the only thing I found was a child's reader that covered the basics but didn't deeply reveal anything of significance.  An online search and looking in local bookstores also produced nothing of interest.  I figured that the real Eric Liddell must have died without leaving any trace of who he was, other that a few facts about the 1924 Olympics and that he had died as a Missionary in China during WWII.

Then I stumbled across this documentary that completely tells the full story.  How great that this was put together while there are still people living who actually knew Mr. Liddell!  After watching this, I really believe that Eric Liddell as a real live man actually exceeded his movie persona as portrayed in CHARIOTS OF FIRE.  I am so glad that I found this and it was so worthwhile to buy it.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1343779200,10,1018,4.377659574468085
3105175,5,B0013E35HW,I would highly recommend this biography about Eric Liddell.  It is well done and a story worth watching.  It was wonderful that his daughter was still alive and could be interviewed.,1330300800,,182,4.838709677419355
3105176,5,B0013E35HW,"This documentary is included as a bonus on the children's DVD ""The Torchlighters: The Eric Liddell Story"", so I am presuming it is the same program.  This program is very well done and I highly recommend it, not only for Christians but for all who are generally interested in history and sports. In addition to Mr. Liddell's Christian beliefs and dedication, topics discussed include: Christian missionary work in China; collegiate sports and boarding-school life in England; the 1924 Paris Olympics; the Japanese occupation of northern China in the 1930s and 1940s; and the internment of foreign nationals by the Japanese during World War II. Commentators include David McCasland (author of ""Eric Liddell: Pure Gold""), eldest daughter Patricia Russell, the Rev. John Keddie (consultant to the film ""Chariots of Fire""), and several internees of the Weihsien camp who knew Eric Liddell personally.  All in all, a fitting tribute to a fascinating and inspirational servant of God!",1201824000,15,978,5.303225806451613
