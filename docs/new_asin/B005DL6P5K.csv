Kelso's Choices are proving to be a valuable tool to use to help the children in our preschool solve their own small problems.
It is a great way to prepare them for the world in front of them and gives them strategies they can use all their lives.",1423094400,,251,4.122448979591836
8467149,5,B005DL6P5K,I am a new school counselor and this is a wonderful tool to teach and empower children on how to first use critical thinking and then offers practical tools to solve small problems. I liked how the short video clips showed many examples of small problems and then showed children solving the problems in different ways.  The video even had a segment on big problems and showed children turning to adults for help. I used this in second grade and it was very age appropriate for students in grades 1-3.  I plan to show it next year to third grade as a helpful reminder.,1388620800,,568,4.451923076923077
