8003503,5,B0000V8FAG,"I know this series is not visually stunning. It may not have the best premise in the world. And it certainy has flaws.... But I love it! The characters are really likeable. The story, while simple, it's entertaining and has it's great moments. The music is simply beautiful. Don't be so shallow to dismiss it just because it's old.",1073001600,,331,4.627118644067797
8003504,5,B0000V8FAG,"As I mentioned in my review of the first volume, Saint Seiya was the anime that first got me started in anime.
  The second volume of the series finishes off the ""Galaxian Wars"" subplot, revealing it to have essentially been a smoke-and-mirrors method for drawing out the REAL baddies. The real adventures of the Saints have now begun. We get our first good look at both Andromeda Shun -- the almost-TOO-cute, green-haired Saint who is potentially the most powerful of them all -- and his (currently evil) brother Phoenix Ikki. Ikki is the Saints' first major adversary, allowing us to have a lot of character conflict and angst as well as stylized superhuman conflict, some of which is pretty cool.
  It should be noted that the names of the characters are significant; Seiya's name translates to ""star arrow"", which is a term for ""meteor"" (and his special attack is the Ryo Sei Ken, the Meteor Fist). Cygnus Hyoga's name means ""Glacier""; Shiryu means ""Lavender Dragon"" IIRC, Ikki's translates roughly to ""point of briliance"", and Shun is a ""twinkling, as of stars"".
  The dub for the ADV series is LIGHTYEARS superior to the terrible hackjob shown on Cartoon Network, and of course the subtitles are good. Plus the original music remains intact.
  It's fun, it's high quality, what more do you want?",1072828800,6,1301,4.855203619909502
8003505,4,B0000V8FAG,I have seen the whole series many times already and therefore won't comment on the story. I just wonder why this 2nd volume is a special order.,1072224000,,143,4.333333333333333
