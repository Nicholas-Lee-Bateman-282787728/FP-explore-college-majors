7814244,5,6301569229,"One of my favorite movies of all time. A schizophrenic clown running amok in a theme park that teeters on the brink of a mob takeover. Lots of pun humor, its goofy and doesn't take itself too seriously. The viewer shouldn't take it seriously either. If you're not a fan of 80's cheese peppered with a little bit of obvious racism and plays on homophobia, this isn't your movie. Sometimes it pushes the envelope and you can't help but cheer for the clown who has everything against him even his own mind. A underdog tale at it's best with an unlikely hero.",1497052800,2,555,4.450980392156863
7814245,3,6301569229,"This PG-13 Rated film can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy film or a horror film. It is much too tame to be either, but it does have its moments.",1386115200,,163,3.6857142857142855
7814246,4,6301569229,"fun for amusement park enthusiasts 4 Stars.  A little silly and a ""B"" movie for everyone else, 2 stars.  ok",1359244800,2,107,4.3
7814247,1,6301569229,I must have gone to dumbland when I purchased this DVD. Nothing is good about it. it isn't a horror movie. It's for sure not funny. I have seen cockroachs more interesting to watch than this junk. It is stupid. I can't say anything good about it.,1344124800,,246,4.25531914893617
7814248,5,6301569229,"Okay first of all, this movie can not be defined as horror, comedy, or dramatic because it is all three. I feel this movie could be a cult classic, if it were marketed correctly. It's so bizarre, twisteed, goofy, and stupid how can it be labeled? I can guarantee for a person to enjoy this film he/she has to be in a ""what the?"" mood. Mixed lightly with a teaspoon of ""Okay?"" Some of the weirder scenes in the film: 1) at bosse's funeral the clown stands infront of the casket, and talks about how his boss would get a thrill from his secretary's t_ts. 2) The talking pepperoni puppet who likes to argue with his owner 3)the freak out scene when Bruce Burger imagines everyone dancing about, while one lady prances around in a pair of bat styled wings.
Probably one of the goofiest ideas was the mob boss who bought the park...rip off of the God Father Movie. One surprise is that one of the dorky security guards was played by the same woman who was Mimi in The Drew Carry Show.
As I said, this movie has a real flavor to it, but it's a taste you have to aquire first before eating it all up.",1258329600,5,1093,4.23444976076555
7814249,1,6301569229,"My, my, my, where do I start?  I guess I will note how I came across Funland. My girlfriend knows I love cheesy horror movies so she bought Funland, as a Christmas gift.  She had no knowledge of this movie and bought it on a whim.  Once I watched it, I questioned if she really liked me or not.  I mean if you want to break up with a guy cheat on him, or steal his car you don't have to give him this movie on DVD.

As for the movie, not sure how to categorize it, is it a horror or a comedy?  The movie centers around a clown named Bruce Burger, played by David Ladner (Laverne & Shirley's Squiggy).  Basically, Bruce Burger is the mascot of Funland and he is having a hard time separating his life and the character he is playing.  Bruce Burger also talks to ""people who aren't there"", like a dead co-worker, Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe.  Then there is his puppet Peter Pepperoni, which Bruce Burger carries full on conversations with.  Every time I heard the name Peter Pepperoni and saw the puppet, I was laughing so hard I couldn't stand it.  The theme song called ""Funland"", is also painful, ""Mama please take me to Funland....."" Once I hear this song, I wanted to be fed rat droppings.

This movie is 1980's cheese at its best or worst.  I wouldn't say it is a horror movie and it really isn't a comedy.  My best bet is to call it a satire, but it is still lame.  This movie might have been praised better if it was promoted differently.  Funland has the potential to be a nasty little horror film, but nothing ever seems to happen.  It just runs out of gas.  If you like to see Bruce Burger A.K.A Squiggy flip his lid, go for it.  If you want to use Bruce Burger A.K.A Squiggy as a case study for delusions, dissociative identity disorder and/or schizophrenia, you might have a winner.  Otherwise, this could be viewed as one of the worst movies ever made.  Also, I don't even know why the clown's name is Bruce Burger when he is dressed like a slice of pizza.  The only scary part about this movie isn't that someone wrote the screenplay, but that someone produced it into a movie. Oh and if you are wondering if the theme park that is being used is Six Flags over Atlanta, Georgia you are correct. I have been to that park; I can't believe I am linked to Funland.",1172448000,4,2280,4.253488372093023
7814250,1,6301569229,"I rented this movie from Blockbuster, and I really wish I didn't. This is beyond a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. It has no recognizable plot. It is neither funny, nor scary. It is just pathetic. Please, don't rent this film, and do not buy it. I don't understand why Amazon even sells this.

And for some reason after watching this movie, I feel depressed. I don't know if it was the dark lighting or the clown who sat in a dark room and talked to himself during the entire movie, but for some reason, this movie has really upset me, and I really wish I didn't watch it.",1162684800,5,578,4.207207207207207
7814251,2,6301569229,"This film was an early outing for Bonnie Turner, who would go on to creat 3rd ROCK FROM THE SUN and THAT 70s SHOW.  As such, it is a great opportunity to see the roots of this phenominal writer.  You can even see her in a bit role as a militant park security guard.  However, if you're looking for horror or action, go elsewhere.  This is strictly a two note film - the first being a vehicle for Turner's budding talent, and the second to see the phenomenal David Ladner (remember Squiggy in LAVERNE & SHIRLEY?) in an outing as a psychotic clown.  Not a great film, but a good bit of amusement for a week night.",1080172800,6,611,4.188034188034188
7814252,1,6301569229,This movie may seem like it is worth the money but belive me he only kills one person with the gun.  If you had to ask me to by it and recive a million dollars I'd tell em that there crazy.  If you don't want to belive me go rent the stinking movie then see what your mind tells you.  I am 12 and I love horror but this is not even action.  Dosen't come close to horror ethir so please people don't waste your money on a stupid film like this.,1013472000,5,443,3.782608695652174
