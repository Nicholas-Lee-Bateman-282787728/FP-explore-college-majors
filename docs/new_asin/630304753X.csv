The character  development from start to finish was heartwarming and intriguing. What an  original idea too! I mean, a Golden Bear! This movie would have to be  ranked up there with Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Shawshank Redemption.  Please people, honestly, this film is a cinematic suppository and you  actually run a risk of decreased intellect by watching it. BEWARE!",965088000,2,498,5.012195121951219
