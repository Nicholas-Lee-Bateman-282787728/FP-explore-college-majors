This is the intro and one segment of the Playtime video.  Depending on the video, it addresses different segments of the day and life. There are 6 English videos in all, and what I found on Amazon, is that they come individually, or as 2 box sets that have 3 videos in each.  You can purchase these as dvd's or digital download. The discs are:

Disc 1: Eating and drinking
Disc 2: Wake up smiling
Disc 3: Playtime
Disc 4: In my home
Disc 5: Happy, Sad, Silly
Disc 6: I can count!

My son was diagnosed as expressive receptive disorder (difficulties expressing/verbal talking and receiving/understanding) when he was 2, with warning signs for autism.  At 3, he was diagnosed as also having autism, high functioning, and besides the verbal stuff, has difficulties with emotions, understanding others emotions, things like brushing teeth, potty training.  At the age of 3 he speaks like a 2 year old, and it is garbled, broken, not full sentences.  He found these videos on Amazon Prime Instant video, but in Chinese.  Is what caught my attention was the Chinese and that he was repeating it!  I couldn't get him to repeat English but he was copying Chinese (his favorite), Spanish, French, etc.  For some reason he loves these so I didn't see any English version for Amazon Prime video but they where for sale, so I bought them because I didn't want him learning Chinese when he couldn't even speak English.

These English videos are the exact same animation and real life scenes as the other languages but with English.  Is how they work, is a scene, say a ball is on the screen and the word ""ball"" will be shown, and a nice, clear woman's voice will say ""ball"", then a different ball will be shown and will repeat the same thing, and then the next scene will be a boy playing with a ball (all real life images and snips of active videos) and the boy will throw the ball and then the voice will say ""he is playing with the ball"" or something like that.  Then it will add another kid in and say ""they are playing with the ball"".  For the Eat video, one example that my son repeats and now says in our daily life, and did not say before these videos is orange juice.  Similar to the ball example, they show a glass of orange juice being poured, and say orange juice, show a woman drinking orange juice and say ""she is drinking orange juice"" or ""he is drinking orange juice for breakfast"".  Then all of a sudden an animated panda bear will march across the scene or pop his head in from the side.  All the clips of videos and scene are of real life kids, people, items and are short and change fast enough it keeps my son happy and interested, along with the animate clips/images randomly thrown in.  I also like that fact they put the word on the screen that they are focusing on, so he can learn to see and understand it.  Although I want him to know phonics and not just site words, this is just another tool for him/us to learn to speak/read/write.

I am very happy with these videos and bought them all. The ""in home"" video, I believe it is, has one item that would be nice to take out; it says something like ""don't be scared of the dark"" and I am not sure why they would suggest this to kids because they pick up ""I should be afraid of the dark"".  My son now runs around, when lights are low and says ""scare dar"" which is him saying scared because it is dark, and he isn't but says it and acts like he is for a minute. Although his understanding may be limited to these videos for a lot of the content, and might just be simple reciting/copying, it is helping him be verbal and then when I have the real life item, I try to say it and get him to copy and understand and it has worked with things like Orange Juice or Park, mommy, daddy, etc.

I would definitely recommend these videos, for not only second language, but for English as a first language!",1439078400,,4278,4.720430107526882
8468234,2,B005EHDCGS,"We liked the first set, vol. 1-3.  This set didn't seem any more advanced than the first and had unusual words such as pirate . . . Not basic English words.  It also had a part about being scared by the dark, why suggest this?  Repeated the first ones too with animals again.  I would recommend the first set but not this one.",1436486400,,326,4.126984126984127
8468235,5,B005EHDCGS,"My toddler LOVES the Little Pim series.  He loves watching the babies, and I like that it's mostly real objects and not cartoony things he can't relate to yet.  Great for when mommy needs a break, and it reinforces the words that he knows.  I purchased this set for a friend overseas because I am sure her baby will enjoy these as much as mine did.  It has been the only videos that could keep his attention for long.",1401753600,2,417,4.2405063291139244
