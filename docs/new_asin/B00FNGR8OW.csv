8617151,5,B00FNGR8OW,"KELLY'S HEROES is more than just a WWII heist film. I believe its theme is anti war. There are a lot of smiles, goofiness and laughs throughout, but the film never losses sight that this is still a war film and it plays out in a background of stark realism. There are some very somber and reflective moments in the film. Its all about $16,000,000 in gold bars that the Nazis have and Kelly forms a team to steal before the Nazis can move it. It is interesting how Brian G. Hutton directed both KELLY'S HEROES and WHERE EAGLES DARE and essentially that is really those two films are his two greatest and almost only achievements in the cinema. The performances and the characters they portrayed of Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Gavin MacLeod, Carroll O'Connor, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Davalos, and Perry Lopez have essentially been immortalized by this film.",1390867200,,894,4.811688311688312
