7305782,5,B0107GC96Y,"What a perfect movie for a father and his son to watch together. My son loves war games, he's 11 and he knows nearly everything about all guns. And no war games does not make him violent, he played the games with his father and learned the history about war from me. The movie had an important plot that I have been thinking about for years, the relationship between a father and son. The problem for the two men in this movie was they never met their dads. Both dads died as hero's in the war. They laid down their lives for their friends. I never had a real father because mine was an angry drunk who spent his time hurting our family and not being a father. These men missed out having a father in a different way. I relate with them because I look at God as my true example of a father. Both men had trouble dealing in their own ways because they also lost their moms.
My son watched the movie, loved seeing the weapons and letting me know what each one was. He also thought the movie was very sad. Both men turning their lives over to God (in their own time) related to how their fathers turned their lives over to God. My son almost lost his father two years ago which we both talked about. I'm told by everybody that I am a good father, which means the world considering what I went through in my life. Eleven years of a stay at home father has been a pleasure for me. The guys in this film never had the chance to spend time with their fathers and in this aspect, I believe my son and I are very lucky because we can spend that important time together",1445904000,3,1559,4.131578947368421
7305783,3,B0107GC96Y,"The premise of ""Faith of Our Fathers"" is simply that sons of today can learn from the faith held by their fathers even though the father was absent from their lives.

As a whole, I enjoyed the movie. Some of the acting was not up to top grade, but on the whole it was good. The mood of the film switched from dull daily life to comedic between the two main characters as they traveled from Louisiana to the Vietnam War Memorial ""The Wall."" And then in the midst of these comedic scenes it would switch decades back to the Vietnam War and show the two main character's fathers in combat.

John Paul (from California) flies to Louisiana to hunt down one of his father's war buddies and finds the son, Wayne, instead. This in itself is a bit bizarre because it is uncommon for someone to go to this extreme to chase down an unknown individual. However, he does it and when he gets there he is met with shotgun blasts from behind the door of a very unfriendly man, Wayne. So John Paul just sits down in front of the house and waits for Wayne to open the door. This goes on all day and evening. Again, a bit off the wall behavior. Then then two of them start out the next morning to drive from Louisiana to ""The Wall.""

After these scenes of unusual behavior, the drive becomes one of slapstick comedy.

So you just have to wrap your mind around this unseemly behavior and the serious scenes in Vietnam. Once you do this, the film is worth seeing. The end is ""box of tissues"" material and quite moving.

As I said before, I enjoyed it and can recommend it. Now it does have some intensity in the battle scene which you will want to prepare young children for. There is no profanity and no bedroom scenes.

Disclosure- I did receive a sample of the product in exchange for this review and post.",1445817600,21,1788,4.306547619047619
7305784,4,B0107GC96Y,"As Veteran's Day approaches, I can think of no greater tribute than to offer a great review and giveaway of the DVD Faith of Our Fathers from Pure Flix Entertainment and Flyby Promotions. My father and mother both served during the Vietnam War and theirs was not the story that was glorified and honored when they returned like those of the WW1 and WWII campaigns.

In Faith of Our Fathers conveys the story of two men Eddie and Steven who in 1969 find themselves fighting side by side in the Vietnam war, and soon become more than friends and partners, but true brothers in the war so to speak. As the war continues they both write to the sons, John Paul and Wayne they have in the states through a series of letters hoping their words might inspire and encourage their sons should they return from the war. However after a five day mission to retrieve fallen comrades, they both lose their lives.

Now twenty five years later, John Paul and Wayne meet as John Paul tries to find the man his father talked so valiantly about in hopes of learning more about his father, but when he comes across Wayne, he is nothing but a bitter alcoholic who doesn't want anything to do with the father he feels has abandoned him. Yet he holds the only key to John Paul understanding his own father, and he manages to convince Wayne to journey with him to the Vietnam Wall in Washington DC, as Wayne gives him letters from his own father for a price along the way. They two will understand more than they ever thought possible as the movie takes viewers back through a series of flashbacks to help understand the bond that their fathers shared and how it will forever change their own perspectives of who they believed their fathers were.

I received Faith of Our Fathers compliments of Pure Flix Entertainment and FlyBy Promotions for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own personal ones. This DVD runs 96 minutes and contains special features such as, The Heart of Faith of our Fathers, Honoring Father's Day, Commemorating Memorial Day, Si Robertson Interview, and Stephen Baldwin Interview. Candace Cameron Bure, Rebecca St. James, Stephen Baldwin and Si Robertson star in this amazing movie. It parallels the story of fathers and sons, twenty five years apart, and shows how they are bound together forever which is such a worthy tribute to our veterans this Veteran's Day!",1445558400,7,2460,4.689814814814815
7305785,1,B0107GC96Y,"As a Christian I want to support Christian films, but in all honesty the Pureflix preview was so misleading I was shocked as I watched the movie! I just kept telling myself, ""It will get better. It has to - the preview was so incredible!"" But sadly - no, the entire movie was just weird. The strange way that the director tried to be funny was not shown in the preview and didn't appeal to me at all. 90% of the preview was about the fathers back in Vietnam, when in fact that was most of the war footage in this 96 minute movie. From the fact that Downes' character (John) leaves his fiance - at her insistence to make contact with White's character (Wayne), 3 weeks before their wedding. ""Lack of John's resolve"" causes Wayne to make John sit in Wayne's dump of a yard all day after flying from CA to MS, then at night he invites John into his house, only to tell him absolutely nothing till the next morning. At dark thirty John is awakened by a chainsaw wielding Wayne, turning his car into a convertible for ""the road trip"" to the Vietnam Memorial. Wayne will only allow John to read his own father's letters at $500 per letter! On the way to ""The Wall"", Wayne gets into a brawl with some ""rednecks"" and John helps beat them, then Wayne picks up a couple of hitchhikers, only to have John let them steal the car. And all the while back at the ranch Johns fiance is freaking on him about not being there for her Do I really need to go on? I wish I had read the imdb reviewers posts - they pegged this movie! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1322393/reviews?ref_=tt_ov_rt",1445299200,39,1569,4.3951890034364265
7305786,5,B0107GC96Y,"Thank you Kevin Downes and David A.R. White for yet another fantastic movie. This one was encouraging, edifying, funny, and had me crying.

I give this five stars all the way! I noticed however that IMbd gave this movie a 2.7 out of 10. In a very Christlike way I would like to inform the secular critics that they are idiots who have no clue what Christian's want and should keep their filthy stupid opinions to themselves. Unfortunately I'm still trying to figure out that Christlike way to inform them. So until then. thank you again pureflix for another fantastic movie to add to my collection.

God bless you guys.

7305788,5,B0107GC96Y,"REVIEW FOR FAITH OF OUR FATHERS

With the Vietnam War raging in 1969, two young fathers report for duty. A man of great faith and a doubtful cynic. A quarter-century later, their sons, Wayne and John Paul (David A.R. White and Kevin Downes), meet as strangers. Guided by handwritten letters from their fathers from the battlefield, they embark on an unforgettable journey to The Wall-the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Along the way, they discover the devastation of war cannot break the love of a father for his son.

7305800,2,B0107GC96Y,"I can usually watch almost any movie all the way to the end -- but not this one.  It was a waste of time.  First, I am so sick and tired of the stereotypes one finds so often in Christian films.  For example, to stress that modern day Christian women are not expected to be 'barefoot and pregnant,' Christian films often swing to the opposite extreme and portray women (like John's fiancee) as hopelessly unable to perform the most basic of domestic chores.  [I'm pretty sure this same stereotype was used in The Resurrection of Gavin Stone, another recent Christian film.]  Please, give me a break.  The opening scene of, ""Honey, please don't cook:  let's order pizza!"" (because she is a horrible cook) was stupid and insulting.

Second, the story line was idiotic.  Like John is REALLY going to fly across the country three weeks before his wedding to confront (whomever answers the door) because after a lifetime of not knowing anything about his father, he just CAN'T wait 24 hours to see if he can get the guy he's trying to reach (Wayne) on the phone?  And he is REALLY going to sit outside all day waiting on Wayne to let him in the house and talk to him?  And Wayne has absolutely nothing going on in his life that he can spur of the moment say ""We're going to Washington D.C."" with a total stranger -- the same total stranger he made wait outside an entire day before he would deign to even speak to him?  And you are REALLY going to leave your car empty, with keys in the ignition, with complete strangers you picked up as hitchhikers the day before milling around with easy access to it? No one is that trusting.

And, like, REALLY that every letter Wayne's father writes home from Vietnam is going to be completely about how wonderful John's father is, a man who is a total stranger to his family?  Give me a break.  So unbelievable.

Third, the 'humor' was juvenile, predictable and HOKEY TO THE MAX -- as it often is in Christian films, which is so sad and embarrassing. About the time the hitchhikers stole the car, I couldn't take any more.  My reaction was, ""Clearly this movie isn't going to get any better or more realistic; why waste any further time?""",1508716800,,2172,4.486005089058525

For a movie with Christian themes and characters, I have enjoyed ""End of the Spear"" and ""Woodlawn"", both true stories. ""Unbroken"" is also good, but I would recommend the movie over the book any day, as it cut-out the significance of the main character's faith to such a degree that it ruined it for me.

This movie was a bit different than I thought after seeing the trailer for it. But for the good. Kevin Downes and David A.R. White did a great job playing two young men trying to learn about their fathers who became friends while serving in Vietnam and were both killed there. It is through a series of letters that the two men learn something about their fathers and themselves. There are some poignant, serious scenes from the war that form a serious focus in the movie and yet the characters of Downes and White have a comical element as they learn to care about each other through the adventure of driving to the Vietnam wall in DC. I don't think the humorous element of the relationship between a straight-laced suburbanite and a socially detached hick from back-country Louisiana takes away from the seriousness of the Vietnam War and sharing the gospel of Jesus to hungry souls. A very well-produced movie with a good plot and action to keep you plugged in. The end of the movie is the best with a lot of touching and misty-eyed sentiment.",1451692800,8,1176,4.525821596244131

7305927,5,B0107GC96Y,"Faith of Our Fathers is a creators of other recently known films such as Gods Not Dead and Do You Believe.
The film was directed by the wonderful Carey Scott.
Harold Uhl, Carey Scott, Kevin Downes and David A.R. White wrote the story that took place during the Vietnam War when two fathers (Sean McGowan and Scott Whyte) reported for duty, leaving their very young sons at home.  One man is quite a cynic and the other has so much faith!  Later on, years later, their sons John Paul (Kevin Downes) and Wayne (David A.R. White) meet up.  As strangers, John Paul and Wayne read letters from their fathers on their way to The Wall  quite an unforgettable journey where you learn about family, freedom, and faith!
David A.R. White, Michael Scott, Shelene Bryan, Kevin Downes, and Bobby Downes produced this amazing film that you will definitely want to see.
There were many wonderful stars in the film including: Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Downes, David A.R. White, Rebecca St. James, with Si Robertson, and Candace Cameron Bure.
So Im sure you're not only wanting to know about the film, but what I thought about it, right?  Did I like it? Love it?  Was it just plain awful?  Hmmm
Let me tell you, the film, being about the military had some pull to me wanting to view it at first.  My aunt and cousin was/is in the military.  I wasn't sure how that would affect me while watching the film  I didn't know if it would make me more intrigued by it, or if it would turn me off.  The action in the film was good.  There wasn't too much as to disturb those watching, but enough to get the idea of it being during the time of the Vietnam War.  My only concern was to make sure there was a disclaimer of anyone who may have PTSD due to the scene in the middle (not giving away any major scenes or anything) of the film, but when John Pauls and Waynes father die.
I loved the fact that David A.R. White was in the movie, as I enjoy watching him on film a great deal.  Ive been a huge fan of Candace Cameron Bure as well (yes, I grew up on Full House  and am ready to see Fuller House).  The entire cast was amazing and had a great chemistry.  I was quite pleased with how they worked together.
The entire story line was very well designed.  The writers did a great job with this film.  I believe many will learn a great deal from the film and want to see if over again.  This is one you will want to see with many different groups of people.  Not only does it involve family  the relationships of brotherhood, a marriage, and father/son relationships, but it also deals with freedom  of our country and I also saw freedom of guilt that one man held onto for far too long.  The film involves a lot of faith, learning more about it and learning to have more of it.",1447200000,3,2747,4.289320388349514
7305928,5,B0107GC96Y,"For me, exceptional Christian films are sometimes hard to find, and thankfully this is one I can highly recommend. Furthermore, I was ecstatic to recognize so many actors in this film, so as I begin to review this film, I find it a true honor.
At the very heart of this film is the relationship between these two characters, John and Wayne. For David, this role of the somewhat impudent Wayne is a bit of a departure from the roles I am used to seeing him portray, but he plays the part of this peculiar man faultlessly, and the interactions between his character and John are exceptional. They provide much of the humor in the film, but there are also some highly dramatic parts definitely worth noting as well. On the shoulders of these two competent men rest the bulk of the film's story, and I found myself especially intrigued by the story they were recounting through flashback. Though a myriad of pitfalls bombard these two unlikely companions, the end is never in question. But as with most movies of this genre, it is the journey to the destination that makes the ride entertainingly worthwhile.
It was an unexpected delight to see ""Uncle Si"" appear in this film, and although he was the gas station attendant, come on, we know he was really playing himself. He brings his signature wit and demeanor to the role, and it warms my heart to see the Robertson family making the rounds in Christian films today. Long may that continue.
Seeing Candace Cameron Bure in the film was another welcome surprise. As I have followed her for the majority of her career, I have been consistently impressed with her talent as well as her stalwart devotion to her Christian faith in spite of any stumbling blocks or snares in her way. She is always beautiful, and when she acts, it is purely effortless. There are few people who are born with the innate ability to act, and she is decidedly one of them. I am devoted to everything about her, and my support will always be with her.  In this role, though small, she makes a memorable contribution as only she can.
In the flashback sections of the film, we are treated the acting abilities of Sean and Scott in the roles of the soldiers who gave everything they had in Vietnam. Although I am unfamiliar with the acting of these two, they fit their roles quite well and give noteworthy performances. While I know very little about the actual horrors of the Vietnam War, what I have heard is enough for me to realize that even after all this time, that war is looked back upon with great difficulties due to public perception, official decisions, and horrendous conditions.",1447200000,,2611,4.61505376344086

7305930,4,B0107GC96Y,"Faith of our Fathers was a really good movie. It's about two men whose fathers both perished in the Vietnam War. They're both seeking answers about their dads, and they come together in a hilarious way. One guy is a rough-around-the-edges character, and the other is soft-spoken and determined . . . and a bit naive. As they travel together to Washington, D.C., a bunch of obstacles impede their efforts to find answers. They have to learn to work together through the ridiculous (yet funny!) situations they find themselves in.

The characters are great, the storyline is funny, touching, and may even jerk a tear from your eye. The movie is rated PG-13 due to the war scenes. There's no foul language or explicit scenes. My 11-year-old watched along with us without problem.

The Vietnam War is something that is often not talked about, and so my children received some entertaining education and opened up discussion about the Vietnam War.

I really think this is a great movie for those who like war movies. It's a clean, Christian-based film that is entertaining and uplifting. I gladly recommend it!",1447113600,,1105,4.867021276595745
7305931,3,B0107GC96Y,"I know there are many in the Christian community who will enjoy Faith of our Fathers. I wish I could tell you that I love this film but I do not.

While the story is interesting, the pace of the film is slow. The acting is good but I've come to expect much more from a David A.R. White and/or Kevin Downes movie. There is humorand a funny segment is due to the quirky performance of Si Robertsonand some of the dramatic moments are very compelling. However, the hackneyed portrayals of ""good ole boys"" and back country Southern folk in general were stale, stereotypical, and left this country girl unimpressed.

The movie is family friendy, the message is a positive one, so there is an audience within the Christian community. I just think Pure Flix could have done a better job telling this story.",1447113600,,799,4.541666666666667

7305934,5,B0107GC96Y,"I guess some Christians might shy away from a movie with ""Christian themes"" they way they might pass by a similar book.  How good can a story be if it is seen as 'santized' (no swearing, no PDAs or mention of physical relation between the sexes)?

Likewise, some people of other different faiths might pass this movie by cause it mentions Christianity and Jesus.

Both those groups of people would be missing a beautiful movie if they browsed by ""Faith of our Fathers"".

Eddie and Steven are two young soldiers in Vietnam.  The war wasn't pretty or sanitized.  There would be no ticker tape parades for returning soldiers as for those who had served in other wars in the 20th century and earlier.  All the soldiers in those jungles had was each other, their weapons, and, if they were lucky, their faith in God (whatever their religion might be).

John Paul and Wayne are Steven and Eddie's sons, respectively.  John Paul (whose surname is ""George"" - can we say Beatle-fan parents?) is a straight arrow like his father, and Wayne is adrift, much like Eddie was before he met Steven.

Wayne is a bit of a wild-man.  His hair is mussed up, his clothing is very casual, as is his manner.  He tries to 'sell' John Paul some letters that might have information about their fathers.  Wayne decides they should travel to the Vietnam Wall in DC, so John Paul's 'quick info trip' turns into a 5-day US safari with quite a string of adventures.

At one point, they part company, and not on the best of terms.  That's probably because they land in jail.  John Paul makes bail.  Wayne does not.  But, in a fortuitous turn of events, the police officer who took them in was their father's old sergeant back in the war.  People looking for faults might point to that as contrived.  But it did not seem so to me.

Wayne and John Paul accept the officer's invitation to reminisce about their fathers.  He provides some closure they might not have gotten any other way.  Since their car was previously stolen, the man offers Wayne the keys to one of his vehicles.  Wayne does not accept.  The man throws them a second time and tells Wayne to take them, the vehicle and John Paul and go to the Wall before he changes his mind.

This was the point where the tears that had been threatening in my eyes for a while started spilling over.  I don't think my eyes were dry for the rest of the movie.

Faith of our Fathers is a touching, heart-warming movie about faith, fathers and sons, and losses associated with war.  And being released, as it has, shortly before Veteran's Day here in the US, a gentle reminder of the sacrifices made by soldiers, veterans and their families and the debt those of us who are able to stay safely at home, owe to these service men and women.

I am sad that Faith of our Fathers will probably never have the wide release that I feel it deserves, in part due to the mentions of religion.  But I loved it.

Men and women who go and fight for our Country to keep us safe. Terrible when you find it good and a blessing your son is hurt over their and gets to come home. It was a blessing to me.  I know my heart was in this movie and a great movie for all to see and think about what others have done for us. Where we here need to have their backs. What these two boys did to find out about their fathers and what fathers did to find their sons was a sweet story to the heart to find some kind of peace . Which they all did find. Sad yes but true.

It has some great moments by AR White and it is well done overall. The PG-13 rating is for war violence (which is a bit intense at the end but no more than a superhero movie). I watched it with all my kids and had no issues. Very forward with its Christian message, and is definitely puts the Gospel message right out there. It's a tear-jerker. Something I would recommend to those who like Christian films but are looking for something a bit different than what's out there. Great casting, too.

7305937,5,B0107GC96Y,"An emotional story of two sons and their journey to find answers concerning their fathers who served together in the Vietnam War. One son knows nothing about his father just what his mother had told him until one day she passed away and the home he grew up in becomes his. Cleaning and searching through things in the garage he finds a box his mother labeled to keep. When he opens it he finds his fathers things when he served in Vietnam, now he contacts someone and this is where the adventure turns from bad to worse. Well you can say the story will take both characters on a road trip to the Vietnam Memorial Wall but along the way their faith will be tested. Ones faith will hold true because of his upbringing but the other, he will learn to have faith and find himself and break down those walls that holds just pure bitterness in his heart. But all this is due to the fact how their fathers lives had intermingled when they became soldiers in a war. How one helped the other to find God when they most needed it and what transpired after that is the most touching scene I had seen. I was an emotional wreck but to find the solace they found made me tear up. Both sons and fathers found their solace in Jesus Christ. I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd and Im sure you will too.

7305938,4,B0107GC96Y,"We watched this movie as a family and overall was very pleased with it.  I couldn't imagine growing up and not knowing your father, but this is a reality for some.  This is a very touching movie that is filled with every emotion possible.  I would say the one thing that I wasn't crazy about in the movie was Wayne.  The character can get a little annoying at times, but I totally get where they were going with it.",1447027200,,415,4.215189873417722
7305939,5,B0107GC96Y,"Faith of our Fathers has a beautiful picture of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus. I was touched by the bond that the fathers Eddie and Steven formed in the Vietnam War. One had a strong relationship with the Lord and the other one was on a journey that leads him on the road of salvation. What a clear message that we don't know when we will meet the creator of the universe face to face. I was brought to tears many times throughout.

John Paul and Wayne start out with a rocky relationship. Both of these young men are so different in so many ways. It makes it funny and it also has a few quirky parts. Both sons lost their fathers in the war. Each one is searching to know more about the men their fathers were. Its life changing for both of them.

The film is rated PG-13 due to some war scenes and some violence. I would let my kids watch this as its you don't see blood and gore. Its extremely tasteful for the whole family. Some younger kids may get scared due to the war scenes.

My father served in Vietnam and I lost him at a very young age. I know that Vietnam changed him in so many ways. What a touching tribute to the men who lost their lives in this war. Very touching for the families whos fathers gave their lives for this country.

7305940,4,B0107GC96Y,I received this DVD for free for the purpose of a review.  This movie surprised me.  I was expecting it to be very serious and somber and although the movie does have those moments it was also very silly at times and made me laugh.  I liked that I was able to play this movie at night while my kids were still up and not worry about what they would see on the TV if they came into my room.  My daughter watched it for a while with me although she's still a bit too young to follow the story-line.  My son wanted to know what I was laughing at when he heard me laugh out loud.  The movie makes you stop and think about what your kids will keep with them when it comes to your faith and it makes me consider writing letters to them to let them know how much I love them.  It's also a movie that makes you appreciate the huge sacrifices others have made for us.,1447027200,,858,3.953488372093023
7305941,4,B0107GC96Y,"I really enjoyed the story of the film but feel the writing could've been a bit better and the character of Wayne wasn't very believable and quite frankly was really annoying.

It seemed the makers of the film were trying too hard to make the road trip the two sons take to be some grand adventure with various mishaps along the way. Obviously they were trying to lengthen the movie to make it feature length and to allow us to see a glimpse into the relationship of the fathers and it's significance. It would've been more believable if Wayne hadn't been portrayed so poorly.

Regardless of all that, the story is still worth being told and if you can get past Wayne you can actually enjoy the movie for what it is. And I can say that weren't too many awkward/unnatural ""Christian moments"" making the movie one I could recommend if was movies are your thing.",1447027200,,859,4.5

7305944,5,B0107GC96Y,"Faith of our fathers is an excellent movie! We truly loved watching this over and over! Such a clear presentation of the Gospel of Christ like I had never heard it before. I am in awe of how the entire staff pulled together such a beautiful movie.

 The first time I saw it, I was invited to a special screening of it in Louisville. It really touched me.

I got to watch it with my boys at home, and so I asked them what their thoughts were.

Jonah says, I loved the clear presentation of the Gospel. I had to agree. That was on of the first things I said when I first watched the movie. That is the clearest presentation of the Gospel I had ever heard. It was simple, straight from the Scriptures. You just cannot get anymore clearer than that. Christ loves you, and he died for you.

I asked my son Adam, the same question, He says, It was good.  He is 15. Not much for words, unless it is about something he wants to talk about.

I really liked how the they would go from the present day sons, to their fathers fighting the war. I think that acting was spot on, The storyline was clear.

7305946,5,B0107GC96Y,"Years ago a small scaled replica of the Vietnam Wall was traveling around the nation, vets who were with the Wall were able to be thanked by many for their service.  To see the equipment, pictures, flags, names on the Wall and other items was a very humbling experience.  When I learned about this film, I knew it would be a very touching movie.  One cannot help but see the names of those who gave their all engraved on the Wall and be changed.
At the time, these servicemen came back from the Vietnam War weren't thanked or seen as heroes and knowing that was beyond my understanding.  Now that my sons are older, they thank anyone they see in any uniform for their service.  Those who weren't touched so intimately by losing a father, uncle or having them come home perhaps as an amputee have really no idea how hard it was for the remaining surviving spouses and friends.  Sometimes that ignorance can lead us to be arrogant or ungrateful to God and those who served for what we richly enjoy these days.
When you watch this movie, you might tear up as I did or you might not.  Whether you do or don't isn't the point.  The point is how men reached out and shared the Gospel, the eternal hope even when it was mocked or made fun of just like people do today.  Yet, we cannot help but share the hope that is within us and teach the coming generations the cost people paid for our freedom in America, and Jesus paid so we can be reconciled to God.
In the Gospel of John, we are reminded:  Greater love has no one than this:  to lay down ones life for ones friends.  Those who serve in the Armed Forces and in towns everywhere as EMTs, police or firefighters should be thanked and shown the love God has for them.  Please consider how God may call you to support them and share Gods love for them with the message of the cross.
It is my sincerest desire that people watch the movie and share a copy with others.  Whomever God leads you to, may they come to understand the One who gave the greatest sacrifice before we even knew we needed a Savior.  God Bless.
Please thank those who have and do serve either in the Armed Forces or local emergency teams.",1446854400,,2153,4.294554455445544

But I have to say that it is a good and interesting movie. I watched it by my self on my me time so I could understand the whole movie.

It was a bit funny and emotional at the same time to me.
Love the way the actors form their roles and how they grew together.
It shows how two different man became good friends and evolved to a friendship with faith, and two sons living their daily different lives also came together and learned about their fathers even though they never seen them.
 Guided by handwritten letters from their fathers from the battlefield, they embark on an unforgettable journey to The Wall-the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Along the way, they discover the devastation of war cannot break the love of a father for his son.

7305949,3,B0107GC96Y,"This movie was little uneven to me.  I really loved the wartime flashbacks and the building of the story of the war, but the 1990s setting with John Paul and Wayne falls a little flat for me.  Both of them, as characters are slightly stereotypical and not as well developed as they could be, making their interactions not hit the emotional pitch for me that I think that the filmmakers were going for.

However, the film was pleasant, and I enjoyed the storyline.  My eight year old and my Hubby sat and watched it with me, and my eight year old really got sucked into the storyline, and she enjoyed it very much.  The things that seemed stereotypical or bland to me didn't seem that way to her.  She really got the message of the movie.

I think part of my problem was that I was hoping for a little more of the war and backstory between the fathers than the movie gives, so to find that the movie was dominated by the road trip and the 1990s characters was a disappointment.  It does make a great statement about fathers, about the power of faith, and about how these affirmations can change a life.  So, even though I wouldnt consider it PureFlixs best film, it is definitely a film worth viewing.

7305951,4,B0107GC96Y,"Faith of Our Fathers is told in parallel stories during the Vietnam War and in 1997. Eddie and Steven gave their lives together in Vietnam; more than 25 years later, their sons Wayne and John Paul embark on a search to know their fathers.

At its heart, Faith of Our Fathers is a road movie, as strangers Wayne and John Paul travel from Mississippi to Washington, D.C. to visit the Vietnam Wall. This is actually where I feel like the film falters a bit, as it's never quite funny enough, some of the situations are bizarre without being humorous, and sometimes the acting seems a bit forced. The Vietnam portion, while much shorter, is much stronger, and the ""modern"" section improves greatly once the road trip hijinks are finished. AndI can't believe I'm about to say this, as I'm generally not a fan of his actingStephen Baldwin is one of the highlights of the film (just don't get me started on his ""old man"" makeup ...).

That's not to say this is a bad filmfar from it, in fact. It just suffers from some of the same weaknesses that many faith-based films do: uneven acting and jokes that don't quite land. That said, this is one of the better faith-based films I've seen; better than ""God's Not Dead"" and ""Facing the Giants,"" and not quite as good as ""Courageous"" and ""Do You Believe?"". It's safe for the whole family (that PG-13 rating is due to war violence, but it's mostly off screen and nearly bloodless), and it's worth watching and discussing. 3-1/2 stars.

7305952,5,B0107GC96Y,"Faith of our Fathers has something for every movie fan - action, comedy, drama, and suspense. It's a movie families with older children (due to the fighting scenes) can enjoy together.

As a daughter of a Vietnam War Vet I found it very interesting. As a Christian I found it encouraging.

Early in the movie the character of Stephen George is reading is Bible in a field in Vietnam and says, ""I'm just finding some comfort in a place that's not really comfortable."" That quote sums up the theme of this movie in my opinion.

We're all going to be faced with uncomfortable situations and it's where we find our comfort that matters. This movie leaves no question as to where and how that comfort can be found.

After finding some information about an Edward that knew his father, John Paul sets out on a journey to meet him, only to find it's his son, Eddie. These two men are so different from each other, and yet bound together by the fathers they never really knew.

I found this story to be well written, and for the most part, well acted. Often times, I find Christian based movies to be sorta cheesy, but this one was not. It showed the journey that both men took to find out more about their fathers, and themselves. All throughout, stories of their fathers and how their friendship formed, play out in the Vietnam War. I had moments of tears, and was moved by many of the scenes, as well as lots of laughing! This movie had everything I love and a great message to boot! One of the things I like best is that it can be watched as a whole family. I have kids
ranging in age from 18 down to 8 and it was appropriate for all of them. Some of the Vietnam scenes got my younger two asking lots of questions about wars, but it is all an opportunity for them to learn and grow.

7305955,3,B0107GC96Y,"""Faith of Our Fathers"" was a bit different than what I had originally expected. There were a few parts in the film where the actions of John Paul and Wayne (the sons) seemed a bit unconventional (**SPOILER ALERT** like sawing off the roof of a car in order to make it a convertible for their road trip), but since it is just a movie, I tried not to look too much into these small parts. I particularly enjoyed the scenes that would reflect back to Eddie and Steven, the two fathers. They seemed to grow a strong bond with each other that was evident. I would have liked to see that same rapport happen between their sons earlier on in the movie. When their connection finally happened, the film was almost over. That is when I was left wanting more, and I'm guessing a sequel would be a bit far fetched (although you never know).

All in all, ""Faith of Our Fathers"" is still a nice movie to watch. Being married to a veteran, I have a great appreciation for the premise of this film and the story as a whole, since it personally touches me. As a mother, I can also totally understand that special bond between a child and a parent. As a Christian, I'm very grateful for movies like this. I really enjoy viewing films that are wholesome, heartfelt, and put out a positive message. On a side note, I highly recommend watching Pure Flix's ""God's Not Dead"" and ""Do You Believe?"" These are two of my favorites from Pure Flix Entertainment.

7305958,5,B0107GC96Y,"Faith of Our Fathers is a brand new Christian movie. The movie begins with young couple John Paul (play by Kevin Downes) and Cynthia (played by Candace Carmen Bure). They are getting married in a few weeks. John Paul has unanswered questions about his late father, Eddie. His father served in the Vietnam War alongside his best friend, Steven. They were both tragically killed in combat. He tracks down his fathers best friends son, Wayne (played by David A.R. White). Wayne takes John Paul on a road trip journey to see the Vietnam Wall in Washington, D.C. and he tries to help him discover the truths about their fathers. Along the way, Wayne convinces John Paul to buy the letters he received from his father for $500 dollars a piece. These letters contain information about their fathers and what happened in Vietnam.

I would recommend this amazing movie to anyone who enjoys faith based movies. This movie is a perfect movie to watch to remember Veterans Day. I loved the dynamitic list of movie stars staring in this movie. Candace Carmen Bure is one of my favorite actress who always portrays in nice family friendly roles. I also loved the surprise guest star Duck Dynasty, Si Robertson and how he brought humor to the scene. I loved seeing Christian artist, Rebecca St. James back on screen. I liked the overall plot of the film and how they showed old war scenes to add to the movies appearance. I also liked how the letters showed the journey of how Waynes father became a Christian by being influenced by Eddie. The movie is kind of a sad movie but I liked how the film showed the power of brotherhood in fathers and sons.
