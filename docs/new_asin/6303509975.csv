7849610,5,6303509975,"I believe this film was very much underrated! Kathy has always said that Tennessee Buck was her favorite film, but I think LA Goddess is just as good if not better. Kathy is still beautiful (and the NR version has Kathy full frontal as she steps out of the shower. A very pleasant opening of the movie) and I think she turns in her best acting job. Over all the story is believable and the acting overall (with one exception) is very good. A don't miss for Kathy Shower fans.",1351123200,2,475,4.288888888888889
7849611,4,6303509975,"It may not be a five star winner to be featured as an all-time great classic in your home video library, but what makes this film so great is Kathy Shower. Kathy has to be the most beautiful woman to ever hit the cover of Playboy Magazine. I can only hope that she continues to star in similar films to prove her capability not only as a sexy cover starlet, but as a supporting actress for erotic late night thrillers. I suggest you buy the unrated version where Kathy gets out of the shower at the beginning NAKED! In the R-rated version she gets out of the shower after reaching for a towel to cover herself. Want to see more? Then buy this movie...I guarantee you will not be disappointed!",996192000,8,692,4.3307692307692305
7849612,5,6303509975,"Kathy plays stunt double who really yearns to be successful writer. She is given her chance by reasonably top movie executive but soon it turns to love as she is wooed again and again, wined/ dined, so on, etc by top exec.  I can't help feeling that Kathy deserves more. I know I keep referring to  this 'bedroom' scene or that 'rub-down' scene, that's just because Kathy is  so beautiful. At the same time, there must be more roles for Kathy so as to  allow both her physical and acting talents work in true synchronization.
As for L.A Goddess. The film is by the numbers, no real soul. The  supporting cast do their bit (as much as a supporting cast can do), all the  famous 'actors brothers' are in this if you know what I mean. There are a  few nice scenes as in pool scene with Kathy and the executive or the bed  scene with Kathy and the executive. Kathy may also be seen strutting her  stuff about in those one piece lingerie numbers She likes so much. You can  catch one of these numbers in 'Tennessee Buck' and the Playboy video from  '86. There are two versions of this 'Goddess' . One has Kathy getting out  of the shower at the beginning of the film ...naked, the other not naked. I  could watch Kathy changing the wheel of a tractor or painting the side of  an oil tanker if she were naked. Anything!  The stars are for Kathy. She  put every one there and if you love Kathy Shower like I do then you'll love  this film.  More like this I say, More!",927849600,9,1461,4.250909090909091
