There was only one researcher, who's also made a new video by UFO TV called Atlantis: Secret Star Mappers of a Lost World, who was really the only person who got close to describing any kind of mystery to me. The whole video is nothing but a series of interviews with different scientists and researchers, no graphics, photos or videos. Pretty boring unless you're really already into this stuff. I've been researching the ancient cvilizations of the pre-flood world as found in Genisis and this one author was right on it. But as I said, the others will never be watched again. For the serious researcher like myself who is looking for further evidence of Cain a.k.a. Sargon the Magnificient, it's a piece of the puzzle you won't want to be without, otherwise, I think only researchers of that specific area, throughout all of ancient but not modern history would be intersed in it. It was more about stuff I didn't care if I ever knew about, and not enough information about the stuff I wanted to know more about.",1219708800,6,1066,4.61578947368421
