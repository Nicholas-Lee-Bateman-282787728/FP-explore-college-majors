6035819,2,B00FXCIS90,"I did not like this very much. It got good reviews but I just was not feeling the energy. It felt slow and draggy. The female instructor seemed to be fidgety in her poses. She reminded me of a cat preening. It felt pretentious to me. I previewed all the practices, but just couldn't enjoy it even on mute and fast forward. This one didn't meet my expectations.",1412380800,,360,4.3088235294117645
6035820,5,B00FXCIS90,"Great yoga video to practice at home. Great for beginners to learn and practice yoga. Would highly reccomend this video, it has three levels of practice on it and it is very convenient to have them all on one DVD.",1410912000,2,213,4.35
6035821,4,B00FXCIS90,The 3-pack is good for beginners through advanced. Each practice is fairly long so be sure to allow sufficient time.,1394582400,4,116,4.85
6035822,5,B00FXCIS90,"I bought the flow series before, with each workout on a different DVD when living abroad. I love the Total Yoga DVDs. There is a voiceover explaining each move, and commenting on the benefits of certain moves and other yoga philosophy. This allows the instructors to flow smoothly through each move without having to pause to explain. Everything moves at a really good pace, and the instructions are clearly understood. The only con to this particular DVD, is that each workout is basically only once chapter: you cannot skip single moves in each workout.",1463788800,,555,4.914893617021277
6035823,5,B00FXCIS90,Easy to follow,1456444800,,14,4.0
6035824,5,B00FXCIS90,I had my own copy and enjoyed it so I purchased this one as a gift.,1454976000,,67,3.25
6035825,5,B00FXCIS90,"I discovered Tracy and Ganga about ten years ago,this is the fourth time I am buying their complete flow series,I've done them all for Rodney to shiva and these are te beat by far",1451347200,,179,4.294117647058823
6035826,5,B00FXCIS90,"This has been my go-to home yoga practice for about 15 years and I bought two more to give to friends just starting out. The different practices allow you to ""move up"" as you master beginning poses. Great instructions and explanations including the important yoga breathing to get the most out of your practice.",1451347200,2,311,4.777777777777778
6035827,5,B00FXCIS90,"Love all of Tracy Rich and Ganga White yogas!!! They are the best! This dvd gave me the opportunity to try their earth, water, and fire routines. I still prefer their original, but like to do the water one for its smooth flow also. And for an in-vigorous  yoga workout, fire is incredible!!",1449014400,,290,4.471698113207547
6035828,5,B00FXCIS90,"Best yoga DVD I've ever purchased.  3 levels so you can start out with Earth, move up to Water.  If you're ready for a challenge do Fire.  I've been doing yoga about 14 years but tend to get lazy without a class or something to push me.  This DVD does just that.  I liked it so much that I bought 2 more to give to my adult children as Christmas presents.",1447372800,3,355,3.943661971830986

8619188,5,B00FXCIS90,"A nice, well rounded practice, suitable for beginners through more advanced (3 different practices).  One of my favorite go-to yoga practices.",1515801600,,142,5.761904761904762
8619189,5,B00FXCIS90,Awesome all levels in one cd. Easy to follow.,1506902400,,45,4.111111111111111
8619190,5,B00FXCIS90,I've practiced this yoga series for the past 10 years. I bought this DVD to take on vacations.,1497657600,,94,4.277777777777778
8619191,4,B00FXCIS90,"Challenging for a beginner.  I can get through the Earth & Water segments, but it'll be a while before I'll be ready for the Fire segment",1488240000,,137,4.269230769230769
8619192,5,B00FXCIS90,"This is my third copy of these workouts. I've had them on VHS, DVD that I've lost, and now another replacement set. Every other Yoga workout that I've done feels like bullpoop by comparison. When I was younger and in better shape, I gave away the Earth video because it was too easy. Well, I'm older, in worse shape, and recovering from some injuries, so I really needed it again. I wish there were loads and loads more videos by Tracey Rich and Ganga White.",1486166400,4,458,4.4
8619193,5,B00FXCIS90,Love this dvd.  Very challenging and varied.,1479945600,,44,5.285714285714286
8619194,3,B00FXCIS90,"yoga video is okay.  its VERY slow and VERY late 70/early 80's. the production says it was made more recently but you can't tell that from the people, voice and style of the yoga. I do like the VERY detailed breathing in the first beginner video. Not much variety in the entire set though. I definitely prefer Rodney Yee.",1478390400,,321,4.440677966101695
8619195,2,B00FXCIS90,"The beginner level is to difficult for a beginner who has never done yoga. The beginner level uses terms unknown to a beginner and does not teach what the terms definitions are nor does it teach what yoga positions are and what the names of them are.
I bought this D.V.D because it stated it had a beginner level. I wanted to get more of my body's mobility back that it had a few years ago, but it begins at a point I am working up to. I am sure it is a good tape, but not for beginners. Maybe for individuals who have prior knowledge and exposure to yoga, but not for a beginner.",1474588800,,580,4.052173913043478
8619196,5,B00FXCIS90,Love this DVD,1470009600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8619197,5,B00FXCIS90,"In my humble opinion this is one of the best yoga series available. I started with the Total Yoga original several years ago. It has been my fallback favorite when I'm tired or feeling sore from other types of workouts. If you need something more gentle start with ""Earth"". My husband has knee injuries and a sketchy back and is able to still do most of the practice. I believe the basis of these flows is founded in Ashtanga with variations. Until you get to ""Fire"" though these do not have the intensity of a traditional Ashtanga practice. These DVD's are an awesome way to work up to such a practice.",1467504000,,603,4.441441441441442
