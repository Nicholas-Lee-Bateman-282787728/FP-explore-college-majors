4570759,5,B0054SDJEC,I'm a Martin Clunes junky and will watch anything he's in or connected with. The Reggie Perrin character is so hilarious and the writing is superb!,1332201600,5,147,4.6923076923076925
4570760,5,B0054SDJEC,As usual - Martin Clunes delivered the humor. He takes Reggie to new highs and new lows. You won't be disappointed.,1378080000,2,115,4.523809523809524
4570761,4,B0054SDJEC,"We really enjoy Martin Clunes, so searched for something to watch until we can continue on with the Doc Martin series.  Reggie Perrin is a silly sit com, but no more so than any other mindless TV you might watch on a slow weekday evening.  Some really funny parts and the supporting cast gets some character development in the second and third season - which adds a great new dimension.  I must guiltily admit that I've added ""you silly sausage"" to the household vernacular.",1377043200,,474,4.619047619047619
4570762,4,B0054SDJEC,Season 2 is actually a little better than season 1.  It is humorous and the story line is a little more developed.  Definitely worth watching,1376092800,,141,4.6
4570763,5,B0054SDJEC,I love this show. Martin Clunes is wonderful. It's a very funny show and well written. It is so British!!,1373068800,3,105,4.3
4570764,4,B0054SDJEC,I lov english shows this one is interesting. I always though he was serious but in this he shows his other side,1369785600,2,111,4.090909090909091
4570765,4,B0054SDJEC,"I love British sit coms...but this is a creative, contemplative study of society as well. We are victims of big business and hedonism and Clunes is an incredible actor who I would watch any time!",1369267200,,195,4.6
4570766,5,B0054SDJEC,"Side splitting laughter. Having never seen the original series I was free to enjoy Martin Clunes in this funny series about a mid-level executive  and his mid-life crisis.
I hated the laugh track but it was soon drowned out by my own. My husband actually stood outside our house listening to me for 10 minutes because he said my laughter was so loud and I was obviously enjoying the show so much.",1368748800,,396,4.5
4570767,5,B0054SDJEC,"The season was filled with comedy and drama, and the cast outdid itself in portraying the most hilarious characters while keeping things real. Clunes is a strong actor with spot on timing, perfectly executed comedy, and leaves me wanting more. If there ever is a Season 3, I will certainly be front and center watching.",1368748800,,319,4.818181818181818
4570768,3,B0054SDJEC,"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, starring Leonard Rossiter, was a terrific show.  This retread, even with the great Martin Clunes, can't match it.  But it has some funny moments.",1368489600,,183,4.870967741935484
4570769,5,B0054SDJEC,"Sorry to see that there weren't more seasons after the first two.  Definitely watch all episodes in order, as they build on each other.",1368144000,,135,4.625
4570770,5,B0054SDJEC,"Very definitely one of the cleverest t.v. comedy sit-coms ever in the English language.  Another Martin Clulnes performance to rival, if not exceed, his performance in ""Doc Martin"".",1367884800,,181,5.464285714285714
4570771,5,B0054SDJEC,"In Reggie Perrin, the writing is whip smart, not to mention Clunes delivers his asides and torments in excellent comic style.  A continued exploration of suburban commuting, what to do when you are horribly unhappy in your work.  For an audience, who does NOT have to commute with uncommunicative strangers all crowded together heading for a job you hate, it's a joy to watch Reggie try to figure out what else he can do, when the one thing he is good at is marketing....shaving supplies.",1366761600,,488,4.729411764705882
4570772,5,B0054SDJEC,"Hope there is another season. Really enjoyed the humour, Martin Clunes and whole cast were fabulous, before I started I was curious to see if this new version would be as funny as the original series, think it was even better. Strongly recommend it.",1366156800,,249,4.681818181818182
4570773,5,B0054SDJEC,"Lots of irreverent and thought provoking humor about the middle-class, corporate-job-oriented life. I love the brief fantasies. Wish there were more seasons.",1365811200,,157,6.181818181818182
4570774,5,B0054SDJEC,"A character that feels like most of us do every day.  Work sucks, commuting sucks, life sucks.  This is how it can be.",1365033600,,118,4.086956521739131
4570775,5,B0054SDJEC,REally got into it by season 2 and found I liked Reggie. Love Martin Clune. I hope he doesn't something again soon. What a hoot!,1364601600,,128,4.16
4570776,5,B0054SDJEC,"While not the best comedy on the planet, I think this comes in the top few as having managed to blend mundane with whacky.",1363737600,,122,4.125
4570777,1,B0054SDJEC,"I am a fan of Martin Clune, so I thought I would enjoy anything that he was in,  not so.  The story lines are too bland I was dissapointed.",1362960000,3,139,3.7586206896551726
4570778,5,B0054SDJEC,"As a fan of the original, quirky series ""The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin"", I loved this new series.  I like the way they tied into the old series with the same intro music, putting the original ""boss"" on the cover of the new ""Boss Magazine"", and the quote, ""Reggie, I didn't get to where I am today without....""
Great fun! Enjoy.
But, once again, we must say good-bye to Reggie?  No season three?",1362787200,,401,4.333333333333333
4570779,5,B0054SDJEC,"If you are a fan of Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) this is one to get. It's funny and surprising, very good. I'm still waiting for British Men Behaving Badly to become available on instant video.",1360022400,4,191,4.485714285714286
8457008,4,B0054SDJEC,"Wonderful. We have watched Doc Martin for years. Only recently saw the original movies, when the character was very different. This show definitely clinches the fact that we like Martin Clunes an awful lot. I have to look and see what else he has done. :)",1514505600,,255,4.565217391304348
8457009,5,B0054SDJEC,British humor + corporate shenanigans + marital bliss = middle class life the way we wish it were.  FUNNY!,1494460800,,106,4.578947368421052
8457010,5,B0054SDJEC,"I saw the first season of this program years ago, but never had the chance to watch season 2. I already had a region free dvd player, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon! It does have a wry sense of humor, so it may not be to everyone's taste, but I really liked it. Too bad it only lasted two seasons, I would have liked to have seen more.",1469664000,,345,3.73972602739726
8457011,3,B0054SDJEC,Not quite the writing quality we expected after seeing Clunes in other series.,1462147200,,78,5.076923076923077
8457012,5,B0054SDJEC,The acting is superb. It's a fun look at life situations.,1415404800,,57,4.2727272727272725
8457013,2,B0054SDJEC,"SORRY, I DID NOT CARE  FOR IT AND GAVE IT TO A FRIEND WHO THINKS I GAVE THEM A BAG OF GOLD....",1412467200,,94,3.272727272727273
8457014,5,B0054SDJEC,"Enjoyed the second season, I wish there was more Reggie Perrin.",1408752000,,63,4.818181818181818
8457015,5,B0054SDJEC,Great fun,1405728000,,9,4.0
8457016,1,B0054SDJEC,"Not happy with this movie...I loved the  Dr. Martin series...watched them before renting this movie,  Maybe that was why I  was disappointed with this movie...Found the movie too slow and sort of boring.  Did not finish watching...perhaps I should give it another chance.",1403568000,2,271,5.232558139534884
8457017,5,B0054SDJEC,"Well, I found the background car noises in some of the outdoor scenes a little distracting, otherwise it's fantastic. He is very talented.",1400025600,2,138,5.043478260869565
