5159182,5,B008G33NLG,"At first I didn't like most of Marvel's attempts to do animated films.  I watched a lot of them when they first came out and dismissed them.  After DC let me down with many of their more recent films I decided to check these out again.  Most of them were on Netflix and after watching a few I was sold.

Now I'll admit these aren't all gold and many of them don't compete with some of DC's better work.  However that hardly means they're bad and in fact a lot of them play more like movies and less like comic adaptations.  My main issue with a lot of the DC stuff is they assume you read the story arc the movie is based on.  A lot of important plot points are glazed over leaving you checking Wikipedia to get what happened.  They do zero leg work in establishing everyone and this makes them less stand alone.

These Marvel features feel just like regular movies and many of them are very character driven.  They really do play like animated motion pictures with the ability to do things they couldn't afford to in live action, at least not at the time.  The viewer is introduced to all the elements and it's not assumed that you know anything.  The movies get better as they go on.  I enjoyed Iron Man and Dr. Strange as they played like origin movies with scripts as good as any of their live action counterparts.  A lot of the 2008 Iron Man filmed took cues from it's animated predecessor.  The Hulk movies are some of the best they have to offer and I'm not even a fan of the character.  I thought Thor: Tales of Asgard and Next Avengers were going to be the lamest films in the collection but they turned out to be some of the best.  Despite staring kids they manage to maintain the adult themes that make the other films enjoyable.  Next Avengers especially surprised me with it's bleak post apocalyptic story line involving most of the world's heroes being killed by Ultron leaving their children to grow up without parents.

You'll notice that all the films had the same crew working on them which helps them to keep a sense of continuity.  The weakest films in the set are the Ultimate Avengers movies but this is no surprise as they were the first films this team did together.  These same people went on to make Wolverine and the X-men and Avengers:  Earth's Mightiest Heroes.  If you liked those series then this set will give you a lot of bang for your buck!",1408752000,15,2374,4.357630979498861

5159184,5,B008G33NLG,I bought this collection for my youngest son as he loves superheroes. I then went out an bought him DC movies to show him what real super heroes are supposed to be. Captain America is a drug user and should be banned from baseball forever.,1402876800,,239,4.333333333333333
5159185,2,B008G33NLG,The discs listed in the description were not even close to what came. They were inexpensive and my daughter was okay with them since she didn't even know they were coming and it led to her liking Dr Strange but still inaccurate description.

5159186,3,B008G33NLG,The movies in this set are at best alright. The animations were not very good and most of the stories were pretty boring. The only movie I really thought was good was all the Hulk stuff. This is very very iffy.,1388534400,,210,4.146341463414634
5159187,5,B008G33NLG,Best collection!!! I love this b/c now I own all of them in 1 case which is my favorite kind of collection. I like it when they put the whole series all in one Blu-ray disc. I hate it when you think its in one collection but then they're all separate cases.,1388016000,2,257,3.9615384615384617

How? 1 disc out of 7 doesn't work, this makes the whole Set useless. I own a standard PS4, so I don't see what's the problem.

5159207,3,B008G33NLG,"Many of the movies in this pack are not going to be enjoyable to the casual viewer. The two avengers movies aren't bad but there's no character development and characters that only a comic fan will recognize. Dr. Strange, ironman, are origin stories and so a little boring to me. Next avengers and thor tales of asgard are almost childrens cartoons. Hulk vs is exactly what it sounds like a nonstop fight scene pretty much. Planet Hulk is a real star in this . Well animated and developed it tells a story that could fit in any version of the marvel universe. Now I am not saying any of these are bad, they are good in their own right but unless you want a very eclectic collection of mix and match buy the ones you want individually.",1430784000,4,734,4.364963503649635

The boys are having fun watching the DVDs and then reenacting the stories, along with their own creations, with their collection of action figures (sold separately).  Nice set!",1419552000,7,327,5.018518518518518

GOOD FILMS:
Ultimate Avengers
Invincible Iron Man
Thor: Tales of Asgard
Hulk Planet

OK FILMS:
Hulk vs. Wolverine
Doctor Strange

As a fun watch, this DVD was worth it - but some of the characters weren't very well written and some of the story lines predictable.",1414368000,10,386,4.818181818181818

8527557,3,B008G33NLG,"I want to note that I bought and am reviewing the DVD version. I had considered waiting for a good deal for the Blu-Ray version but after watching some of them on video streaming services, decided that I would be fine with DVD. The animation isn't elaborately detailed, so you're not missing much by going with standard definition DVD instead of high definition Blu-Ray.

The movies I've seen are okay to good, I don't think any of them are great. The problem is they mainly cater to people who are already fans of the characters and aren't good at introducing them to newcomers, with the possible exception of Doctor Strange. I'm sure the individual product pages will have reviews of the movies if you want to read more about the movies. This review is focusing on the presentation of the movies in this package.

The movies included are Ultimate Avengers, Ultimate Avengers 2, Next Avengers, The Invincible Iron Man, Thor: Tales of Asgard, Planet Hulk, Doctor Strange and Hulk Vs (which is actually two 40-minute films: Hulk vs. Thor and Hulk vs. Wolverine). I wrote them in the order they're packed in. These were all released separately on DVD and Blu-Ray with the two Ultimate Avengers movies being released on the same Blu-Ray disc.

This particular set that I am holding might be a reissue. There seems to be a previous version that contains eight separate discs. This one I'm looking at contains five discs: the first three discs are what we call ""flipper discs"" or DVD-10s. Instead of reauthoring the movies to have two on a dual layer DVD, the producers of the set used discs that have reflective data layers on both sides, so you can turn the disc over when you put it in the player and watch a different movie. The discs are otherwise identical to the solo releases. People who've collected DVDs for a long time have definitely seen these as a way to cut down disc count in complete season sets or on early releases to offer fullscreen and widescreen versions on the same disc. The problem with these is that they need to be handled carefully as both sides contain reflective surfaces that contain data and buffs and scratches that can impair playback are easily done. Luckily, the case they come in holds them securely while not being too restrictive, letting you lift them out easily, so just keep your fingers on the edges of the discs or the hole in the middle, and keep them in the player or the case when not in use, and you should be fine.

*Huff...* So, as long as you're prepared for flipper discs, this is a good, cheap way (I bought it in a store for $9.99) to get these eight animated Marvel films in one go.

Disc 1, Side A: Ultimate Avengers
Disc 1, Side B: Ultimate Avengers 2

Disc 2, Side A: New Avengers
Disc 2, Side B: Invincible Iron Man

Disc 3, Side A: Thor: Tales of Asgard
Disc 3, Side B: Planet Hulk

Disc 4: Doctor Strange

Disc 5: Hulk Vs.

The Blu-Ray version, as I understand it, puts Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2 on the same disc (not a flipper), but all the other films have their own discs and comes in a thick 7-disc case. The older version of the DVD set, if it exists, has separate DVDs for each film.",1487721600,6,3162,4.50261780104712
