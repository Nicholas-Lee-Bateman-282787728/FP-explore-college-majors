8467795,4,B005DZLD7G,"Thank you so much for providing a long-forgotten and inaccessible movie from my childhood. I had to do many google searches before ""firebird russian cartoon"" gave me any results! The quality of the film itself is pretty bad, though. I realize it's an older cartoon with zero to little demand so it won't be remastered or touched up. However, the charming qualities of the film, the great music, and the very unique characters made me quickly forget the animation's quirks and just turn up the brightness of my laptop screen. I heartily recommend this product!",1320883200,,559,4.894736842105263
