2930727,3,B000V5EYXS,"Synopsis: The '07 made-for-television `Avenging Angel' is a somewhat entertaining western starring Kevin Sorbo as the avenging angel known as ""the Preacher."" You've seen this storyline many times before, idealistic, God-fearing man stands up against evil only to have his family killed and left with nothing but thoughts of revenge. He returns to the scene of the crime one year later and sees the same form of injustice taking place again perpetrated by the same group of bad guys. Looks like a good time for payback.

Critique:  Sorry to disappoint all the Sorbo fans out there (which I am one of) but this is not a -5 Star- film. The first thing I found to be quite noticeable was the abrupt breaks in the presentation which of course one should expect in a film made for television. However in this case these interruptions were especially annoying because the storyline always seemed to have advanced during the intermission leaving the viewer to feel as though something had been missed. I also found the dialogue to be predictable and uninspired leading to stilted, predictable and one-dimensional performances.

As for Kevin Sorbo? Sorbo is at his best when he is allowed to inject humor and whimsy into his performance. Here in `Avenging Angel' he was confined in a role requiring a stoic, sullen individual. Such a portrayal doesn't play to Kevin's talents and hence doesn't deliver the type of performance his fans have come to expect and enjoy.

Positives: Kevin's real life wife Sam Jenkins has a small role at the beginning of the film as his soon to be deceased wife. It's always nice to see them on the screen together.

My Rating: Worth a watch, but probably not something to add to your permanent DVD collection unless you're a big fan of the big guy, -3 Stars-.",1196208000,10,1780,4.803921568627451
2930728,5,B000V5EYXS,"Avenging Angel is a western movie with a preacher who seeks justice for the untimely murder of both his wife and daughter. Kevin Sorbo (the preacher) manages to show emotional range and change his appearance to reflect his inner struggle to cope with his loss.
The supporting cast consists also does a fine job of displaying acting talent. This movie is simple, yet spectacular. The low budget does not impede the director from delivering one of the best made for television movies that I have seen in years! Good costumes, good location to create a western movie, and amazing acting is what Avenging Angel has for its viewers. Kevin Sorbo alone warrants a star. In fact, this is one of his best movie roles to date.
I rate Avenging Angel a 5 star movie. This will be a classic! Very well done-",1195948800,5,794,4.598591549295775
2930729,5,B000V5EYXS,"Without question,Kevin Sorbo gave his best performance ever in this story of a preacher torn between his faith and his desire for vengence after losing his wife & daughter at the hands of a greedy landbaron's henchmen. This movie will remind you of many of Clint Eastwood's westerns,most notably Pale Rider. As the Preacher grapples with his decision,into his life comes Maggie,a former saloon girl and her young daughter,Amelia. They remind him of what he lost and through the goodness he sees in them,he begins to see the goodness in himself. A wonderful movie for anyone who loves a good western. The dvd extras(an interview w/Sorbo and a featurette on the making of the General Store scene)are wonderful and the packaging is very nice. The only complaint I would have is the lack of deleted scenes,which would have put a new dynamic on the relationship between Maggie & The Preacher. However,that is a minor thing and overall,I absolutely love this movie!",1195084800,23,959,4.962732919254658

And Kevin Sorbo, as the great actor he is, makes the Preacher reminds us how to get back to ourselves after we lose everything in our lives! It's a touching wonderful movie!

2930761,4,B000V5EYXS,"This surprised me!  I'm not a big Kevin Sorbo fan so I went into this not expecting alot.  I watched many of the Hercules episodes with moderate interest but this was actually an entertaining western.  Though the story was common and a bit predictable it was well paced with very good acting and the action sequences were well balanced by the drama and story.

I will have to give some other Kevin Sorbo films a view as a result of this.

This was a made for TV western about a preacher (Kevin Sorbo) who looses his wife and daughter, murdered by the henchmen of a powerful and greedy land barren played by Klaus Hauser.  I saw his name at the beginning credits but did not recognise him until well into the movie.  He played the part well.  Sorbo, as The Preacher, turns from a man of God to a bounty hunter exacting revenge, but his actions nag at his conscience.  Eventually he comes to an understanding of who he is and what he needs to do.  Fine performance by Mr. Sorbo.

This is more than a moderately entertaining western.  They did a good job keeping the story flowing especially considering the limitations that network television puts on time.  It could have used a little more time given to background details, but it wasn't available.  It still makes sense though.  I'd recommend this whether or not you are a Sorbo fan.",1348704000,9,1333,4.495833333333334
2930762,5,B000V5EYXS,"This movie was surprising.  Kevin Sorbo was very good.  The storyline was simple, but effective as a western.  It was not a classic western by any means, but decent to watch or own later.",1317859200,,187,4.4411764705882355
2930763,5,B000V5EYXS,Mr Sorbo and the rest of the crew cast did an outstanding job representing harsh times of this nation. Good job!!Bravo!,1298764800,,119,4.714285714285714

2930765,4,B000V5EYXS,"A preacher turned bounty hunter (Kevin Sorbo) helps a group of homesteaders to stand up to the man who murdered his wife and daughter.

There is nothing original about this made-for-television western, but hey, there's little originality in most westerns, so you can hardly complain. ""Avenging Angel"" is, nevertheless, an entertaining film that contains all of the right elements to please western fans (clear-cut heroes and villains; assorted gun fights; a girl whom you know that our hero will end up with in the end); Sorbo, as usual, is likeable enough to make us care for his character; and the plot is a lot easier to follow and has a much more satisfying ending than Sorbo's other made-for-television western, ""Prarie Fever"". Being made for television and clearly targeted at a family audience, there is very little in this film that is likely to offend anyone. No one ever swears, everyone keeps their clothes on and even though some people do get killed, there is never any blood. Futhermore, there are no moral grey zones - the villains are purely evil and the hero is purely good. There's even a nice little sub-plot about Sorbo's character finding happiness with a single mother and her daughter. It's all pure escapist fantasy, but fans of Sorbo's other films/television shows and western fans in general will likely find this an enjoyable way to spend 81 minutes of their lives.",1230940800,,1392,4.923404255319149

There is so much plot to this movie.  The interaction with this little girl is wonderful. I would recommend this to anyone liking westerns, family togetherness and action to purchase this one.  I love Kevin Sorbo.  I have every movie he has made.  Another great one is Walking Tall and the sequel with him.  The first one with ""the Rock"" was also good, but the 2 follow up movies with Kevin Sorbo are super.  Also, Prarie Fever is another one in my library.  Again with KS.

2930768,5,B000V5EYXS,"This movie was so much more then I had expected.  I really loved the whole story a lot and the great thing was, everyone could watch it. Sorbo really should be a cowboy more often, he makes the role very believable.  I did not expect that.  Cynthia Watros, what an actress... she really fit this whole scene really well and that adorable little girl... she just makes your heart melt. Once again, looking for the hero... look for the ""Man in Black"".. again, would love to see a sequel to this. I truly believe the way things were left with the bad guy, it is a possible venture...

2930770,4,B000V5EYXS,"Avenging Angel is a decent western. Not horrible but not great either. It was nice to see Neil Summers again however through this so/so movie a star is born! Playing the role of Spencer with murderous precision is Lorin McCraley. Remember that name folks. I'm convinced we'll be seeing a lot of him in the future. His facial expressions alone were comedic in an insane kind of way, exactly how I think the Spencer character would be. The conviction with which he delivers his lines is so convincing, when sharing scenes with Kevin Sorbo, you would almost have to wonder who the star of this film really is. I imdb'd him and it says he's in some vampire show on HBO called ""True Blood"" created by Allan Ball. I think i remember him from a Bud Light commercial to but I'm not sure which one. As for Avenging Angel, I felt that in the end I found myself rooting against the bad guys as opposed to rooting for Kevin Sorbo, so props to the bad guys. I would definitely say it's worth the money to pick this one up, if for nothing else the performance of Lorin McCraley, a classic bad guy role brought to life with more emotion, humor and hatred than I've seen in quite some time!!",1204070400,,1175,4.36986301369863
