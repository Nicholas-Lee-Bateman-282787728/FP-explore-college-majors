4573456,5,B0055CP9MC,Arrived on time and in good condition.  Great sampling of this series.  Can't wait until entire series is affordable.  Hurray for oldies TV.,1356825600,,140,5.0
4573457,4,B0055CP9MC,"I've been on a 70's kick recently and for the price this ISIS DVD collection was something I couldn't pass up. I used to watch ISIS and CAPTAIN MARVEL in the late 70's and upon viewing these shows again they sure don't live up to the memory I had of them. Still if you are looking to relive a bit of your childhood or share it with your kids the stories provide good morality lessons for the young ones once they stop laughing at the crude special effects.

I would recommend Wonder Woman over this any day. The production values and acting aren't quite top of the line but this isn't bad at all  if you're looking for some retro fun. Also the show features a young Joanna Cameron and there's nothing wrong with that at all.",1355961600,11,724,4.2773722627737225

Loved this when I was watching Saturday morning cartoons along with Shazam.
They don't do shows like this any longer which is ashamed the moral in every story are just as important today as they were back in the 70s
Fully recommended for the young girl in everyone's family.",1352851200,3,293,4.634615384615385

4573461,3,B0055CP9MC,"When a archaeology teacher (JoAnna Cameron)unearthed an ancient Egyptian amulet, she learns that the item was a magic piece of great power. So, whenever there is trouble, she dons the amulet and chants, ""Oh Mighty Isis"". With that, she transforms into the Egyptian goddess, Isis.
The early 70's was the heyday of Saturday Morning TV. From the people that brought you such cheese as ""Shazam"" and The Real Ghostbusters, comes Iris.
Being around 9 when this came out, I distinctly remember Joanna Cameron giving me a funny feeling,' you know... down there!
And looking at it now.........wow
She was insanely hot!
my first crush. Sigh.
Oh Mighty JoAnna.........

Joanna Cameron is good in the title role, but the series has not aged well. The stories are very simplistic. And with better pacing would last only about 10 minutes today. I watched a couple of episodes then scanned through the rest.

Brian Culter as coworker Rick Mason is particularly bad - very stiff performance.",1432771200,,423,4.780821917808219

4573497,3,B0055CP9MC,"Before the Bush administration put Malicki, Saddam Hussein's political enemy, into power in Iraq after ousting Hussein and his regime, which gave rise to ISIS, there was the Filmation live action series about a little known Egyptian goddess; Isis.

I have the same complaints about this show that I did regarding the Captain Marvel (SHAZAM) series that had come out about the same time.  To me Captain Marvel went after bad guys like Captain Nazi or Mister Mind, or even some of Fawcett or DC comic's heavier hitters (usually reserved for the likes of Superman or Green Lantern).  But nonesuch the case here as Isis is confronted with the everyday problems of boys and girls getting themselves into danger, or, more seriously, confronting bad adults who mean to effect the same.

As a young viewer I thought Isis was pretty.  I liked Isis for that, and because she was a female I had this innate young boy sexism lay over my thought process that it was okay for her to be concerned with the matters of teenagers and younger.  Why was that?  Because all of my teachers, the primary authority figures, were female, as were the parents (mothers) who watched after my friends.  Ergo, Isis taking on school issues and issues orbiting the school or touching neighborhoods, made sense.

Ah, but she's still relegated to going after kids in trouble, and the occasional genuine bad guy who talks kids into doing bad things.  Again, it was a kids' show, so I gave it a very tacit pass, but I still wasn't enthralled with it.

The gist of this review is that my inner boy already knew the values my parents taught to me, and I felt very condescended to and placated to by this kind of show which could have been a little smarter.  Kids may be socially dumb, but they're also pretty smart, just not fully realizing at times all of the consequences of their actions.  And an episode addressing that kind of thinking, I think, would have been far more worthwhile than some of the fare that was offered to young viewers like me.

And I say this without feeling that I was smarter than other kids.  I wasn't.  I say this without feeling superior in intellect and savvy than the other kids, because again, I wasn't.  I was slower to learn.  The other kids were able to get their assignments done.  The other kids, from all indications, seemed to be far more adept at learning, retaining information, and regurgitating it on demand than I.

So, if that's the case, and it was, then how is it this show got made when young viewers like me felt like this was an insult to young viewers intelligence?  Simple answer, a lot of adults tend to forget that they were kids, and that they knew or understood a lot of what went on around them, though not everything.  Kids mature a lot faster than people think, but, on the other hand, that doesn't mean that they are worldly and know  all the ins and outs of social dynamics.  Kids may be ignorant, but everyday they are in their developmental stage they are learning like a hard drive hooked up to a T8 line.  They catch on.  They actually do know right from wrong, though sometimes that example needs to be reinforced to drive the lesson home.  And that's what was missing from this show.

Otherwise it's a decent nostalgia blast.  For all my criticisms of it, I did grin as I watched my then newly purchased DVD set.",1426377600,,3342,4.54180602006689

4573499,5,B0055CP9MC,"I was a huge fan of the T.V. series Isis when I was growing up and when I saw this set I decided to buy it and see if it was as I remembered. Now that I am grown up these shows seem a little silly, but they are well worth watching. This series and many other series similar to these teach moral lessons to kids. These shows teach that truth and honesty is the right way to go. They sure don't make shows like this anymore. I would recommend this for all children. Excellent.",1422057600,5,474,4.0

First of all, she's gorgeous and she has this confident smirk when she's getting the bad guys.  I love when she says ""Oh Mighty Isis"" and lifts her arms....""oh zephyr winds which blow on high, lift me now so I can fly.""  It's actually not a corny show at all.  I was afraid that my childhood memory would not be comparable to watching it as an adult, but I was pleased to see that it's still a pretty good, and fairly well-written kids show.  The cover, as others have noted, does say that there are 5 episodes, but there are indeed 7 on the DVD.  For me, it was just enough to remind me of how much I loved the show, and why.  I wouldn't be interested in owning the whole series, so for me, the 7 episodes on this disc were just enough.  Well, WELL worth the cheap purchase price.",1404259200,18,921,4.313953488372093

I give it 3, because it's not totally complete. In particular, the 2 part episodes. The scene where the two students run out the warehouse, then you see them running up the stairs. Originally, in the scene, the stairway entrance was blocked the boards, the Asian character,( I can't  remember his name right now so I apologize ), used his martial arts skill to break through, and then, the next scene was of them running up the stairs.

Thus, it was not directed at nor had any appeal for the traditional sci-fi audience.  Suffice it to say, it was a big disappointment, barely using the talents of star Joanna Cameron.  There was no unique aspect of the show that you could marvel at; the plots just meandered until the final credits with no excitement whatever...

4573577,4,B0055CP9MC,"I remember watching Secrets of Isis on Saturday mornings when I was much younger. It was great for me then. I loved superheroes and mythology as a child. When I saw it was on DVD at a such a low price I jumped at the chance to add to my collection. The show is still great; but for different reasons now. These days I enjoy it with my wife and kid for the pure nostalgia and cheesiness it offers. We love the disco background music. Unlike Superman and Wonder Woman's secret identities whose professions may lend themselves to some danger along the way, Isis' alter ego is a science teacher--and yet she still somehow gets involved in unlikely adventures--much to our amusement. We always laugh when everybody in town seems to treat a heroine able to fly and lift cars like no big deal. Seriously, they treat Isis like ""Oh hi, Isis, didn't see you there"" and it is just hilarious. Superhero TV was different and simpler then. However, looking at it through a different lens, it is still enjoyable now.

As for the DVD itself, it is just a collection of episodes from the series. No special features or even subtitles. This was disappointing but considering the price, it was to be expected.",1369526400,,1190,4.5607476635514015

While it may not have been a simpler time, we were still literate enough to enjoy television at its finest.

Joanna Cameron plays the role of the attractive goddess in human form with all the powers of her namesake. One important thing for modern viewers. This series is in NO WAY CONNECTED to any terrorist group or association. This has NOTHING to do with anything like that. High morals are taught with borderline preachy levels. GOOD. Surprisingly good special effects for a 1970's Saturday morning show for kids and teens. Not to mention the fact that male adults liked watching this sometimes for obvious reasons.

8457944,4,B0055CP9MC,"The Secrets of Isis was a Saturday morning live-action kid's show that ran for 22 episodes 1975-76. The fantasy show about a teacher/archaeologist who becomes an ancient Egyptian super hero whenever she intones the words, ""Oh Mighty Isis"" generally has not aged well compared with Wonder Woman. However; that was was a prime-time adult show with a much higher budget. Isis was innovative in that it was driven by a strong 1970's female lead character with special powers who was not shy about using them as the situation warranted. Of course Joanna Cameron was stunningly beautiful in her Isis attire. Was she prettier than Lynda Carter? I will leave that for others to decide. Watching the show now, it is fun nostalgic shtick. The theme song, fashions and vintage 1975 Volkswagen Thing that they drive around in all make for a  pleasant visit with old childhood memories of getting up early Saturday morning to eat dry sugar cereal straight out of the box as I sat hypnotized by my favorite kids' shows. That being said, in retrospect, the writing, special effects and the supporting acting are all pretty thin.

This DVD will appeal to x-ers looking for some nostalgic reto-escapism served up Ala-mode with a scoop of sci-fi. The DVD is $6 on Amazon including shipping and includes 7 episodes.  The drawbacks include absolutely ZERO bonus features. Also, the brief ""moral lesson""  segments where Joanna Cameron spoke directly to the camera to share some life lesson about being honest, helping your parents or some such message, were excised for syndication back in the 1970's and are not included here. Some of these ""moral lesson"" segments are included on the complete series box set as a bonus feature. Also none of the Shazam crossover episodes are included. Although you do get seven mostly complete episodes for just $6!  Unfortunately the complete series now sells for over $100, and the reigon 2 set from Spain only has Spanish audio, although it does have better picture quality than the region one set. My advice is to purchase this DVD, and only buy the entire if you absolutely have to ($100+  = kind of a lot for 22 half hour episodes that are incomplete).",1450396800,,2172,4.856756756756757
