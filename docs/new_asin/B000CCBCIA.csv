2457173,5,B000CCBCIA,"I have just now pre-ordered ""Star Trek: Fan Collective - Borg""  Among all Star Trek Episodes I find the ones featuring The Borg the most entertaining of all.  I have to be honest the cost of all the Star Trek series is simply outrageous in my point of view, so i am unwilling to pay what they ask, but i must say that this set of DVD's is a very reasonable price to me.  You get some of the best and most entertaining Star Trek episodes out there at a reasonable price.  I ask you, who can beat that?",1138233600,2,500,4.02020202020202
2457174,5,B000CCBCIA,"For any of you die hard fans out there complaining that this is another attempt at milking the consumer out of more money, you don't need to buy this set. You already have all these episodes on your season sets. This set isn't marketed for you anyway. This is marketed to a more casual fan who hasn't purchased the season sets, but would still like some of the episodes for their collection. I would fit into that category. The Borg were far and away my favorite storylines and I always though it would be great if I could just get the Borg episodes and not the whole season. And low and behold, here is that opportunity. I am very happy to see this release and am anxious to see which episodes are included. Hopefully it includes the two part STTNG where Picard is trasformed into a Borg and of course the first episode where Q first puts them in contact with the Borg. Anyways, I love this idea of the themed sets and the Borg theme is right at the top of my list. My next wish would be a Q set. Keep them coming!!",1136332800,18,1016,4.2153846153846155
2457175,5,B000CCBCIA,"The die hard trek fans may bitch and moan, just as X-Files fans have, about BEST OF sets after the season set releases are done, but there IS such a thing as a casual fan, and I have no problem forking over $30 for themed best of sets. Would I ever buy a VOYAGER season set? No. The show, unlike DS9 or TNG, never produced a fully great season, but throw out some SCORPION, UNIMATRIX ZERO, or ENDGAME (and the inevitable addition of BEST OF BOTH WORLDS) on dvd for under $40? Sign me up (and release the episode list!)",1136332800,,518,4.19
2457176,1,B000CCBCIA,"Another Themed Trek box set and anyone who is a true Trek fan has already bought the box sets if they really wanted them. These of course at the $100.00 price tag. So what does Paramount do? They have to release the episodes Again to try and make even more money off the fans.

Shame on them!",1136246400,3,292,4.12280701754386

2457200,4,B000CCBCIA,"A great collection of the best Borg stories from all of the Star Trek series that featured the Borg (the Original Series and DS9 did not). The selections begin with Enterprise, and end with the last episode of Voyager. Because the Borg featured in many Voyager episodes, this series has more selections than the others. My favorite was the ""Scorpion"" two-parter from Voyager which introduces Species 8472, residents of Fluidic Space.

Definitely one of the better Fan Collective anthologies, and a good choice for those who are interested in the Borg.",1434412800,,551,5.054945054945055

2457205,5,B000CCBCIA,"What's not to like about the Borg! They're a Zombie movie on steroids. They just keep coming and coming. They must be popular for a separate Borg compilation to be put together. You get all the Borg episodes from every Star Trek series.  Then, the Borg meets species 8472, who kicks Borg butt. Those episodes are included as well. A worthy effort, for those who don't mind nightmares.",1429574400,,384,4.647058823529412

2457209,5,B000CCBCIA,"Outstanding dvd Star Trek collection for real fans.  The Borg are the true intergalactic sinister menace to the galaxy's freedom.  Very well conceptualized cybernetic alien villains for the Star Trek franchise.

We have episodes starting with ""Enterprise"", where due to the events from the movie ""First Contact"" with the NG crew, the Borg have landed in Antarctica from their previous battle with Captain Picard in space and have become frozen in ice until thawed out by a science team.

 Then we have the TNG episodes that premiered the Borg characters as a new threat to the Federation, including one of the absolute best episodes (Descent 1 & 2) of the entire series where Data is manipulated by altered renegade Borg Fighters who are being controlled by his evil brother Lore from a distance planet.  Their new political movement based out of an exotic castle on a far out planet in the furthest reaches of the galaxy, and they launch attacks against the peaceful Federation colonies with their super starship.

 In further episodes we have the Borg Queen taking on the crew of Voyager and challenging the loyalty of former reformed Borg 7 of 9.

 Only in my own opinion, the Borg represent warriors & workers of the fantasy and delusional, ""Utopian Society"" & their Queen represents an absolute dictatorship whose drones are convinced that they are living and working in a super perfect world.  These drones are compelled to force other beings around the galaxy to adhere to their system, or make their targets face torture and death if they refuse.  The Borg drones believe their leadership is benign, and cosmic who has only their socialistic interests at heart, while in reality just like any other Socialist dictatorships their leaders are charlatans who exploit, harm, and manipulate their population all the while convincing them otherwise.

 Some of the best intergalactic episodes ever conceived and produced by the ""Star Trek"" creation and acting masters from Paramount Studios.",1425081600,,1992,5.070552147239264
2457210,5,B000CCBCIA,"The star trek borg collection was everything I expected and more.  Each story is a 5 star collectors dream.  All the stories were in sequential order and is worth the price.

All the Enterprise and TNG Borg episodes, and the ""best"" 7 of the 18 Voyager Borg episodes",1408924800,2,730,5.033057851239669

2457221,5,B000CCBCIA,"Mostly Star Trek Voyager episodes, but that is okay. Covers the Borg encounters and Seven of Nine's history. If you want to run through all the (non-movie) Borg encounters, this is the collection to get.",1392508800,,203,4.828571428571428
2457222,4,B000CCBCIA,This is a decent collection of Borg episodes that span across the Star Trek multiverse. I like the fact that I can just pick up the Borg episodes without having to snag an entire season or a box set.,1388793600,,199,4.128205128205129

2457224,4,B000CCBCIA,"Im not a Trekkie or Trekker; Im more of a Star Wars guy. However, I was a fan of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION when it was originally on television. I remember watching the episode when the Enterprise was first introduced to the Borg through Q (Q Who?). I also remember watching the season cliffhanger, The Best of Both Worlds where Picard was kidnapped by the Borg. The Borg were a fearsome antagonist and rightly so. Therefore, I looked forward to watching STAR TREK FAN COLLECTIVE: BORG as it collected together some of the best episodes featuring the Borg. The DVD set includes 4 discs that contain a total of 14 episodes. The episodes are presented as they would have chronologically appeared.

Disc 1:
STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE  Regeneration: In this episode, STAR TREK: ENTERPRISEs
attempt at cashing in on the popularity of the Borg by having an artic expedition on Earth awakening an assimilated alien crew and Captain Archer and crew chasing them down before they escape the solar system. Outside of the continuity problems presented, Regeneration is actually a good episode of Star Trek.
STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION  Q Who?: This is the episode that first introduced
the Borg to the Federation.
STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION  The Best of Both Worlds, Part 1: The first Star
Trek season cliffhanger, where the Borg capture Captain Picard and turn him into Locutus.
STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION  The Best of Both Words, Part 2: continuation of
the series cliffhanger where the Borg prepare to invade and overtake Earth.

Disc 2:
STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION  I Borg: the crew of the Enterprise save an
injured Borg drone. Data and Geordi plan to use the drone as a weapon against the Borg, but as time goes on, the drone show individuality and is called Hugh.
STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION  Descent, Part I: the Enterprise encounter a
planet apparently ruled by individualist Borg.
STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION  Descent, Part II : continuation of the previous
 episode.
STAR TREK: VOYAGER  Scorpion, Part I:  the crew of Voyager and the Borg have to form
an alliance to defeat Species 8472. Seven of Nine is introduced.

Disc 3:
STAR TREK: VOYAGER  Scorpion, Part II: continuation of the previous episode, the Borg
and the crew of Voyagers alliance is broken after the confrontation with Species 8472.
STAR TREK: VOYAGER  Drone: a malfunction in the transporter chamber with Seven of
Nine and the Doctor causes the creation of an advanced Borg that the Voyager crew help
make into an individual.
STAR TREK: VOYAGER  Dark Frontier: the crew of Voyager makes a plan to steal the
transwarp coil of a damaged Borg sphere. Also, Seven of Nine has memories of her parents abduction and comes face to face with the Borg Queen.

Disc 4:
STAR TREK: VOYAGER  Unimatrix Zero, Part I: a Fifth Column of sorts is discovered in
 the dream world of some of the Borg called Unimatrix Zero.
STAR TREK: VOYAGER  Unimatrix Zero, Part II: second part of the previous episode
where Janeway plans on using Unimatrix Zero as a way to cause destruction to the Borg.
STAR TREK: VOYAGER  Endgame: the finale of STAR TREK: VOYAGER where a future
 Janeway travels through time to help Voyager get back home sooner.

Other than some text commentaries for some of the episodes, there are no extras on this set.

Overall, this is a good collection of Star Trek episodes featuring the Borg.",1385596800,,3375,4.799307958477509
2457225,5,B000CCBCIA,"If your a long time fan or if you want to get into Star Trek, this is the DVD set for you. The borg have always scared the crap out of me ever since i was a little kid. Watching how they came into the Star Trek series really made it an enjoyable expeirance. I strongly recommend this to those who are intrested. Trust me: its worth it.",1384905600,,335,3.9411764705882355

2457227,5,B000CCBCIA,"Just another link in the fan collective collection. Sorry, no pun intended. At first I wondered why I started buying these fan collectives, I already own all the series.

2457229,5,B000CCBCIA,It is a good value for the price. Nice touch to present the shows in chronological order spread out over three star trek franchises. Only way to make it better would be to include the opening Deep Space 9 adventure which included a borg cameo.,1366243200,,243,4.4222222222222225
2457230,5,B000CCBCIA,"Many of these episodes are found on other collections but this is still a great set. It contains the borg in all of their glory. And it ties the various Star Trek series together with the Borg theme. If you want to put a topper on this theme, add in the film ""Star Trek: First Contact"".",1366156800,,286,4.125
2457231,3,B000CCBCIA,"I watched the dvd once and put it away. I don't know if it will be on the rotation list to watch. maybe once a year. The shows are what they are, gets a little boring after a while.",1364169600,,181,3.6666666666666665

Because of the time frame when the VHS Collection was first introduced years ago, they have now added ""A Lot"" of extra movies in this DVD collection that were not available before, it's awesome...it really tells the entire story of ""The Borg"".

I did not know that they first appeared in Enterprise and were instrumental for Voyager making it back to the Alpha Quadrant.

Seeing all the Borg episodes in Enterprise, in Voyager and finally the TNG in chronological order put their history into perspective.

2457235,5,B000CCBCIA,Nice that this collection spans several of the different Star Trek series.  Having these in one collection is so much easier than looking through the entire series trying to find the best of the Borg.,1357084800,,200,4.714285714285714
2457236,5,B000CCBCIA,"I think these fan collective titles are a decent idea as this one gives you a bit of a few of the Star Trek spin-offs as there is 1 Enterprise episode, 6 Next Generation and 7 Voyager episodes all dealing with the Borg. If commentaries aren't your thing then this doesn't have much in the way of special features for you. If you are a Borg fan like I am and you don't own complete seasons then this IS for you. You get Q, 7 of 9, Picard being assimilated...hours of entertainment.",1356480000,,480,4.228260869565218

with no problems. Some wear on case.",1351814400,,129,5.190476190476191
2457241,5,B000CCBCIA,"This is a good collection of Borg episodes. I also own ""Star Trek: First Contact"" on DVD (holding off on the BD purchase) and I figure someday my kid would want to know more about Picard's personal history with the Borg that is mentioned in that film. This TV box set answers those questions and even throws in a few other ""Borg"" episodes from the other franchises (it contains mostly The Next Generation and Voyager but there is one Enterprise episode here as well). The ""ST: Enterprise"" episode, ""Regeneration"" that is included in this box set could even serve as a ""sequel"" of sorts to the events in ""Star Trek: First Contact"".

There is some annoying blue tinting on the left side of the screen during the opening credits of TNG and aside from the audio commentary on ""Regeneration"" and text commentary for ""Best of Both Worlds I and II"" and ""Unimatrix Zero II"" there really aren't any extras on this collection. This box set could have really used an interview or two, a behind the scenes look at Borg VFX, makeup, etc. Even an animated DVD menu would have helped. Overall, great episodes to show your kids before popping in ""First Contact"" but don't buy it just for the small handful of extras. If you own any other Star Trek box sets, you may want to also cross check the episode listings to make sure you aren't doubling up on episodes you already own because there may be some overlap there.",1335744000,2,1400,4.555555555555555
2457242,5,B000CCBCIA,"Your resistance is futile. The Borg, the most dangerous enemy in the Star Treck universe. With episodes from Star Treck the tv series, ST Next Generation, and ST Voyager, this is an excellent set of episodes. If you like the Borg, or you missed any of the tv eposodes, this is your chance to catch up. Even if you have no clue about the Borg, you'll like this series.",1314057600,,367,4.333333333333333
2457243,3,B000CCBCIA,"It was an excellent series. But it irritating, because it kept getting ready to go to commercial sound, then no commercial. The original Star Trek series played straight through like a movie.",1300492800,,191,5.0
2457244,5,B000CCBCIA,My family watched this over many evenings.  Everyone looked forward to the next session with the borg.  At some point we took on some borg behavior and had borg dreams.  This could be a little much for younger ones so be ready for having them up and awake at night.  Our 11 y.o. daughter was just fine but I know a few years earlier she would have been sleeping in our room a few nights.,1300320000,,387,4.12
2457245,5,B000CCBCIA,"This is a great collection of episodes spanning nearly the entire Star Trek universe. I consider it the best of the ""Fan Collective"" series, which in this case is very well titled, considering the battles of Captains Archer, Picard, and Janeway against the Borg, the cybernetic adversary of the Federation that assimilates cultures and civilizations (as well as their knowledge and experiences) into their hive-like single consciousness.

Anchored by the award-winning ST:TNG episode ""Best of Both Worlds"", not liking these group of Star Trek episodes would be futile. For the Star Trek fan, it has action and drama, nearly sending the Starships Enterprise and the Starship Voyager to their destruction, and forcing each captain to improvise and examine the morality of their decisions, keeping in spirit of the ""morality play"" which defines the Star Trek franchise.",1297555200,,866,5.367647058823529

It was about an individual Borg man/drone picked up by the Enterprise and was fascinating in that it explained a lot about the Borg.  Included Captain James T. Kirk, Scotty, Spok etc.
I recently purchased the re-vamped TV Series including all three series.  Does this include this original Borg encounter or was it lost?  Have only just started to watch the old series which is timeless.

2457260,5,B000CCBCIA,"Another awesome collection for ""Star Trek"" fans who want just the Borg episodes, but including the feature film ""First Contact"" would have been a good way to start this one, simply because it explains how the first Enterprise, Captain Archer's ship from the show ""Enterprise"" encounters the Borg by accident , many complained about this one, why, I do not know, in this episode ""Regeneration"" an expidition team in the arctic discover the remains of the Borg sphere that Picard & Co. destroyed in 2063 as they pursued the Borg back in time to stop them from altering history in the feature film ""First Contact"", unless you have seen the film. this ""Enterprise"" episode will not make sense to you, unaware of what they have found buried underneath the snow, the team tries to preserve their new discovery, soon the Borg once thawed, regenerate themselves & assimulate the arctic team members, when contact is lost, Archer is ordered to intercept the stolen arctic freighter that the Borg are using to fly home, it is here that Archer comes in contact with the Borg as they try to access the ship's computers, Archer has them flushed out in the air-lock, as him & Reed plant explosives in the stolen freighter & barely escape with ther lives before it explodes killing the Borg, many didn't like this one, but it does help to explain how the Borg was able to find Earth in Picard's time, as T'Pol informs Archer that they sent a distress call to their homeworld in the Delta Quadrant that would take about 200 years to reach them thus setting up the NG episodes, it also helps to explain how Data & Dr. Crusher might have known how to cure Picard of his Borg infection as Dr. Pholx cures his in Archer's time, many complained that the Federation would have had a history report about Archer's encounter in Picard's time, who says they didn't??, & really, do we ever learn from history anyway, if we don't, then why would they, & let's face it, the Federation probably wouldn't tell Picard & Co. anyway because it would possibly alter their attempt to stop the Borg in ""First Contact"", which by the way they had not done yet in ""Best of Both Worlds"", so it is probably best for them not to know, seeing that they caused it in the first place, one would have to assume that the Federation didn't percieve it as a serious threat however, as they discovered, they were wrong,  which brings me to NG's ""Q-Who"" where Q introduces Picard & Co. to the Borg, being the devious one that he is, it is fair to assume that Q would not reveal Archer's encounter anyway, which many have said he would have, their main complaint for ""Enterprise's"" Regeneration"" episode, let's be real people, would Q ruin the element of surprise, I think not, which brings me to NG's ""Best of Both Worlds"" this was the best cliffhanger episode if there ever was one, where Picard & Co. are attacked by the Borg & Picard is abducted & assimulated into the collective, & Riker now has to decide whether to destroy Picard or save him, he attempts to destroy, but fails, then realizes he can rescue Picard & possibly retrieve vital information from Picard's mind to find their weakness & hopefully save him as well, this was a cool two-parter no doubt, the next one ""I, Borg"" is where they find a frozen Borg on a ice planet that was left behind & seems to be able to think consciously about himself & his surrondings, Picard, still reeling from his Borg experience orders him destroyed, but is swayed by members of the crew to reconsider, this one of course sets up the two-part episode ""Descent"" in which as a result of this Borg's(I, Borg) emotions has somehow instilled individual thinking among other Borg members, with Data's evil twin Lore leading them, ""Voyager's Scorpion"" episode introduces a new villian, & ""Dark Frontier"" introduces the sexy Seven Of Nine's Jeri Ryan, but the the two-part episode ""EndGame"" bring back Alice Krige as the Borg Queen from ""First Contact"" & is as good as NG's ""Best of Both Worlds"", again this is an awesome collection, but it still should have included ""First Contact""!!",1221350400,2,4076,4.645429362880886

2457263,4,B000CCBCIA,"I always found my favorite episodes in any Star trek series were the ones with the Borg, They were opponents dreamt up after the Ferengi induced more laughter than fear, and they were good villains to have around. My favorite episode was TNG, the Best of both worlds, and I feel it was movie material. Look at this 2 part cliffhanger compared to wimpy movie productions like Nemesis, and you will see what I mean...

About the product:
1. It comes in a cardboard slipcase, with nice graphics inside
2. A plastic DVD book, unlike the bad packaging that the Enterprise DVD set came in
3. Opens like a book, should last a while, with care
4. Not a very sturdy construction
5. 4 DVDs, with 16 episodes at 32$, so that is 2$ each.. but all of them are good episodes, the Enterprise DVD quality is better

It is something every Trek fan should have, if you don't have the episodes separately. Best of both worlds alone, makes the set worth it, though the Voyager episodes are also good, especially Scorpion and Unimatrix 0. I enjoyed Endgame, though it had a shaky plot and was not a fitting end to a 7 year saga.

Definitely worth it. Thinking over this buy is irrelevant,thinking is irrelevant. Prepare your credit card for assimilation!",1213747200,3,1233,4.545045045045045

2457268,5,B000CCBCIA,"The Borg have always been mysterious... so powerful, so pitiless, and so... cubical.  Since I had skipped Voyager, the series (yes, I ended with Deep Space Nine), I had no knowledge that the Borg tales had continued.  Captain Janeway's adventures in the Delta Quadrant surpass Picard's. The Borg collective's home base is IN the Delta Quadrat!  No more of this being chased by a single Borg ship... picture being chased by many.  Then prepare to be introduced to species 8472, who knock off Borg ships like fleas off a dog.  In a switch from Picard's friendly drone, Hugh, the crew of the Voyager  captures and ""tames"" their own drone, Seven of Nine.  The big new addition is the introduction of the Borg Queen, and the secret world of select drones, Unimatrix Zero.  Finally, the ending episode has Captain Janeway and Admiral Janeway (!) working together to get Voyager home and destroy one of the hearts of the Collective.

Wow!  Many of these episodes were complex, two-parters.  You will understand the Borg better.

Resistance is futile.  These Collective sets (Borg, Klingon, Time Travel, and Q) are really icing on the cake for the Trekkie.  And as the Coneheads say, ""We will enjoy them.""",1196726400,,1197,4.861386138613861

You can actually have both parts of 'The Best of Both Worlds' (as well as several other great season cliffhangers) on dvd without buying 2 seasons!  It would probably be a good idea for them to make a 'Cliffhangers' collection just for that purpose.

Anyway, if you love to hate the borg, I highly recommend buying this set.  I won't bore you with episode details (as they're already listed elsewhere), but suffice it to say, these are really good!  Once you have this, you just have to assimilate the movie 'First Contact,' to complete the borg collective.",1178841600,2,593,4.718446601941747
2457274,5,B000CCBCIA,"I'm not a Trekkie (I have a couple of friends who are), and there is nothing wrong being one.  The fact is,  I'm more of a casual fan.  I think the ""Star Trek"" franchise is not bad, and there are some great intriguing ideas explored in the stories, but I could never get that engaged into most of them.  Then I saw the film ""Star Trek-First Contact"", and I was stunned.  The Borg is, without a doubt, the most jacked-up antagonist the Federation ever had to face.  I also saw a ""Voyager"" episode involving the Borg (it's on this collection), and I was hooked.  Again, I'm still not a total fan.  I don't really plan on getting the other collections, but the Borg is SCARY - in an awesome way.  I did enough ""research"" so I was up to snuff on other storylines so I was able to enjoy this more.

For those who don't know, but if you're reading this you probably already do, the original ""Star Trek"" is not featured because the writers didn't come up with the Borg idea yet.  ""Deep Space Nine"" is also omitted, but the other three shows are present.  The episodes are presented in star date order.  I'm not going to go into who or what the Borg is - if you're reading this, you already know.  Besides, the less said the better, you have to experience it as it plays out.

I don't know too much about ""Enterprise"" with Scott Bakula, but it seems to be a real good quality show (except I feel it has one of the worst opening theme songs ever).  This episode is great though, and it gives a good explanation about the Borg for the unintiated.  Next, there are six ""TNG"" episodes, two of them are two-parters.  ""Q Who?"" is, I believe, the first show to introduce the Borg.  Although the Borg's appearance was not fully realized yet, ""Q Who?"" (scary & suspenseful) and ""I Borg"" (touching & endearing) are incredible, the best shows from ""TNG"".  The others are good too, but they had a tendency to paint themselves into a corner, and they went on a tad too long.

Next, there are seven episodes of ""Voyager"".  Two of them, ""Scorpion"" & ""Unimatrix Zero"", are two-parters; another one, ""Dark Frontier"", is a two-hour season finale, and ""Endgame"" is the two-hour series finale.  Even though I felt ""Voyager"" was inferior to ""TNG""; ""Scorpion"" (which introduced the character Seven of Nine) and ""Endgame"" (which got the actress who played the Borg Queen in the movie to reprise her role) are absolutely amazing.  The other episodes are, of course, good, especially ""Drone"", but like ""TNG"" two-parters, they painted themselves into a corner (so to speak) and seemed reeeaaal long.  However, ""Voyager"" really defined the Borg.  Now, I'm a casual fan, and I loved this.  If you're a Trekkie, you should be ashamed of yourselves if you don't own this.  The fans have spoken, and they picked winners.  Buy it, NOW!",1175990400,7,2795,4.534

I found ""I Borg"" to be rather amusing,and the concept of possible Borg individuality was fascinating. I don't remember ""Drone"" too well because, although it was good, I watch my favorites more often.""Dark Frontier"" with the exploration of Seven's past was good,although I felt sory for Seven during her temporary reassimilation into the collective. Finally,last but not least,""Endgame"" is a remarkably good episode with Voyager's long anticipated return home and the severe blow they dealt the Collective when they managed to destroy a Borg Transwarp hub on the way.

And even though the premise was somewhat lame, I still liked the final episode both of the Voyager series and of this collection -- ""End Game."" But I've watched the version in this set three times now ... and something's not right. I refuse to pay more than $100 to get the full final season of Voyager, which in my opinion included several stinkers, so I'm drawing on my (admittedly) frequently flawed memory here. But I don't remember the original final sequence of ""End Game"" being so ham-handedly edited. You see Yoyager fleeing through a wormhole just ahead of a Borg sphere ... then there's a pause ... then the sphere emerges in the Alpha Quadrant in front of a waiting fleet of Federation starships. They all blast it, there's a big explosion ... and there's Voyager! Surprise! Was Voyager inside the sphere? Why wasn't it also blown up? Who knows?

2457283,5,B000CCBCIA,This is an AWESOME collection. I saw episodes I never did before. Most are from TNG and Voyager. Q takes the TNG crew to the delta Quadrant where they meet the Borg. Captain Picard is assimilated. Capatain Janeway has several confrontations with the Borg Queen. See 7 of 9 become a member of the Voyager crew. This is a must if you are a Borg fan. And don't forget to watch them in order. Resistance is futile!!!,1164931200,2,412,4.363636363636363
2457284,5,B000CCBCIA,"The initial concept of the Borg was chilling in its simplicity: they are a cyborg collective consciousness that consumes all. Everything they encounter is viewed as raw material to be absorbed and made Borg. The Borg are not interested in power or conquest or wealth.  They consider being Borg pretty much the pinnacle of existence. They want to ""raise quality of life for all species,"" as Picard-Locutus insists. The way to do that, in Borg philosophy, is to make all species Borg.

This was the pure idea of the Borg introduced in 1988 in the episode ""Q Who"" and continued on an epic scale in ""The Best of Both Worlds,"" both stories featured in this excellent collection. While I think the idea of the collection is terrific and I bought it on sight, the episodes gathered here only highlight how the Borg concept became corrupted by writers who decided to meddle with the core idea in search of ways to explore well-trodden issues rather than confront the real problems thrown up by the Borg concept: what do you do with such an opponent? How can you win? Is there any chance of a negiotated co-existence? If so, on what terms and how to get there?

The rot starts with ""I, Borg,"" when we meet the cuddly Borg, Hugh. Hugh, once disconnected from the collective, turns to be just a nice kid, a bit pallid and prone to weaing silly black outfits. In a stroke, the writers butchered the pure Borg concept by making individuals of the drones. Now the collective Borg consciousness was cast more as a tyrannical ruler over coerced individuals, and not a single organism with multiple dependent parts (the drones). The movie (not included) continued down this path by introducing the Borg Queen. They tried to make it seem like the Queen was merely a manifestation of the collective, but the tyrarnnical nature of that collective was only reinforced by its incarnation. The Borg became less chillingly alien and more familiar: they had power structures after all, an identifiable ruler with whom Picard could argue and win points of order.

The nadir was reached with the dreadful two-parter ""Descent,"" where we get fully individualized Borg, complete with names and bad attitudes. Now the Borg really were little more than pale blokes in black suits.

The ST: Voyager stories compensate somewhat, esp. the epic two-parter ""Scorpion."" My main gripe here is that the post-movie Borg look about 50% as cool as the original ones introduced in ""Q Who."" The Borg outfits now look like jumpsuits with bits stuck on, there are far fewer tubes and mechanized limbs, their death pallor has given way to mottled skin with a greenish tinge, and they have menacing, snarling expressions. This makes the Borg malevolent and evil, when the beauty of the initial concept made them far scarier -- they were totally indifferent as they went about their Borg business and destroyed your way of life. The continued exploration of Borg Rehab with the individualizing of Seven of Nine in ""Drone"" underlined the mistakes made in ""I, Borg.""

Finally, it was a dreadful mistake to introduce Borg into ST: Enterprise, a story that opens this collection (which is arranged by Stardate chronology). This opened a series of glaring contradictions and discontinuities that go unresolved. If the Archer Enterprise encountered the Borg, photographed them, studied them, and fought them, why were they such a complete surprise to Picard's crew some 200 years later? Weren't they already in the Federation databanks? Hadn't the Federation been given a 200-year lead time to prepare for the inevitable invasion? If so, why the less than a year of thinking about them in ""The Best of Both Worlds""? And if Archer encountered the post-movie Borg (with their injected nano-technology and green skin) why did Picard encounter pallid, non-nano-equipped Borg two centuries later?

The Borg represent a great idea that was corrupted by uninspired writing. But you still have to have this collective, if you're a Borg lover. I give it five stars, despite the presnce of dross like ""I, Borg"" and ""Descent.""",1154649600,47,4059,4.925438596491228

A sequel to Star Trek First Contact and a prequel to ""Q Who"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds."" I never have seen this episode all the way through when it first aired.

To be fair I never got completely into ""Enterprise"" and honestly it was done with care much like Sussman's other work on the show. I found it at least entertaining.

Commentary with writers Mike Sussman and Phyllis Strong does not disappoint . It does not put you to sleep. Both writers talk about their reactions to what fans had to say about this particular episode. As well as how this episode came to be as well as some other interesting trivia.

With TNG ""Q Who?"" the first aired appearance of the Borg.

the nail biting ""The Best of Both Worlds"" , the Borg Hugh is featured in ""I,Borg"" and its sequel story ""Descent Parts One and two""

The next 3 Disk expand into Star Trek Voyager with Scorpion parts One and Two, Drone, Dark Frontier, Unimatrix Parts one and two and Endgame.

""Endgame"" can also be found on the Time Travel Set. ""Q Who?"" can also be found on the Q Continuum set.

One of biggest quirks about most of the Trek DVD's at least for me has been the packaging. It does not have to be flashy or fancy they left the product speak for itself. Which it should be. They are still uniformed much like the other Fan Collections but theirs no fancy plastic of chrome all over the place.

 And it is more apparent in The Fan Collection DVD's where the product speaks for itself. All four DVD's are packaged in a slim case about the size of the recent Movie Collector Editions. So if your worried about space.

To the powers that be make more...I know I would not be disapointed when the Klingon Set comes out.

But this collection has all the powerful episodes together in one place, which is great if you don't have the money or inclination to buy the individual series.

2457288,5,B000CCBCIA,"The Borg Collective is a great little set, tightly focused on one aspect of the Star Trek universe.  Its a nice alternative to the full season sets.  And it really is a trade off.  You don't get the diversity or the episodes of a full season, then again...  you aren't paying the full price of a Trek season.

The Borg collective features an episode from Enterprise, a handful of TNG, and a good sampling of Voyager episodes.  For those without a UPN affiliate in their area, some of this material might be 'new' Trek.  Something we could all do with these days.

Long story short, if you are specifically interested in one aspect of the Trek Universe, such as the Borg or Q...  then the Collective is a great way to own some Star Trek on DVD.",1153267200,,743,4.364963503649635
2457289,4,B000CCBCIA,"This could have been one of the best ST comps yet, if only it was complete. The Voyager episodes Dark Frontier and Endgame were both two-part cliffhangers when they were first run, yet paramount has only included one half of each two-parter on this collection. Here is an idea: Lose Dark Frontier and include both parts of Endgame. Endgame was not only the Voyager season finale, but the final destruction of the Borg itself, the race of aliens this series focuses on. Admittedly, Dark Frontier is good stuff, and probably deserved a place in this collection, but only half the episode/story? When weighed against one another, Endgame is clearly the one that needs to be in the collection, so why split these two cliffhanger episodes? Other than this bizzare choice of half stories in the Voyager stuff, the rest of the borg collection is pretty tight, with all the best (voted on by fans) Borg entries in all the series this race of aliens appeared in. Classic TNG episodes like ""Q Who"" and ""Best of Both Worlds"" are present, as well as newer stories from ST:ENT and ST:VOY. After another run through of these episodes, the Voyager stuff seemed to be a bit tighter than the rest, as it is shot a bit better, lit better, and the effects technology had improved quite a bit. I think the ST producers found a happy medium in production design with Voyager, as TNG looks a bit too bright and sterile and DS9 was too damn dark (production design, not theme). To me, Voyager still looks slick and these episodes play well, years later. Almost a great collection, if not for some odd episode choices.",1151452800,2,1594,4.656028368794326
2457290,5,B000CCBCIA,"I won't go into the details of the DVD, since it has already been well covered by other reviews.

As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the main problem with the set is the omission of Seven-of-Nine's physical transformation.  Without the missing episode, Seven-of-Nine's character jumps from fully Borg (at the end of Scorpion part II), to her familiar human form (at the start of the ""Drone"" episode).  The addition of ""The Gift/4th season"" episode would have provided more continuity, better explaining her transformation.

Otherwise, together with the ""Star Trek/First Contact"" DVD (provides a circular time travel link to the ""Regeneration"" episode), the main stories of the Federation's encounter with the Borg is well represented in this collection.",1151280000,4,755,5.427350427350428
2457291,4,B000CCBCIA,"The ""Fan Collective"" sets are one of the Star Trek franchise's best ideas.  Only the hardest-cored Trekkie is going to buy every season of every series!  Those of us who are more casual fans want their favourite episodes to be available without having to buy an entire season.  Thus, the Fan Collectives were born.  Voted the best episodes by the fans (on the Trek website), this collection contains the best episodes featuring those best of alien bad guys, the Borg.  The episodes are:

From Enterprise, ""Regeneration"" where the crew fight time-travelling Borg left behind from the film First Contact.

From Next Generation, ""Q Who"" (Q throws the Enterprise into Borg space to prove to Picard that some species cannot be reasoned with); ""Best of Both Worlds"" (Picard is assimilated in an attempt to conquer Earth); ""I, Borg"" (Geordi teaches one Borg drone to be an individual, then sends him back to the Collective); and ""Descent"" (where a Borg ship has fallen under the command of Data's brother, Lor).

From Voyager, ""Scorpion"" (Voyager and the Borg team up to fight Species 8472); ""Drone"" (a Borg hybrid is born on Enterprise); ""Dark Frontier"" (Janeway hatches a plan to steal Borg technology); ""Unimatrix Zero"" (a Borg resistance develops a virtual world where drones can exist as they were before assimilation), and ""Endgame"" (the series finale of the series).

There are some obvious problems with the lineup.  The worst is that the Borg crewmember on Voyager (Seven of Nine) suddenly appears fully-integrated into the Voyager's crew in ""Drone.""  This collection clearly needs the episode ""The Gift"" to show the transition of Trek's most important Borg from drone to human crewman.  More distressing is the inclusion of ""Endgame"" on both this collection and the Time Travel collection.  Surely there are enough Trek episodes to avoid this overlap!  For example, why not have included ""Emissary"" from DS9 (where the Battle of Wolf 359 is re-fought from another perspective), or replaces ""Endgame"" on the Time Travel collection?

Those gripes aside, these episodes are some of the best Trek episodes.  ""Regeneration"" is a much-maligned episode, but one of my favourite from Enterprise.  Many have objected that if Archer encountered the Borg, Picard would have known about it.  However, with thousands of intellegent races in the galaxy (many of which are cybernetic), Picard couldn't have been expected to immediately recognise the Borg when meeting them in ""Q Who.""  ""Best of Both Worlds"" is probably my favourite Next Generation episode.  Unfortunately, the premise of the Borg starts to wear thin after too many episodes - ""Dark Frontier"" and ""Descent"" drag somewhat because we have the feeling we've seen it all before.

There are some commentaries by the usual Trek suspects, but no other extras.  Fortunately, the price is reasonable, the quality of the transfers high, so this set is a good value for someone wanting these episodes but who doesn't want to buy entire seasons of Voyager or Next Generation.",1149465600,6,3018,5.116326530612245
2457292,5,B000CCBCIA,"This is one heck of a great collection for people like me who don't want to get all the episodes from all the series.  As I really like the Borg episodes and I already have the complete TOS and DS9 collections, this is excellent as no TOS episodes(obviously) and no DS9 episodes are on this which means I get to avoid any overlaps!

This collection starts with one of the few good Enterprise episodes, ""Regeneration"" where Borg are discovered on the North Pole, remnants from the encounter with Cochrane and the time-travelling TNG crew as detailed in the Borg movie, are inadvisedly revived by clueless scientists and it's up to Archer's gang to clean up the inevitable mess that's caused.

We next get the introduction of the Borg as Q decides to teach Picard a lesson in humility by sending the Enterprise into the Delta quadrant to face the Borg.  Once this Pandora's box is opened, the episode ends with the foreboding feeling that this would not be the last time that the Federation would have to face the Borg.

We then get the 2 episodes of ""The Best of Both Worlds"" which end disc 1 where Picard becomes assimilated!  Disc 2 begins with ""I, Borg"" where Picard faces the ethical dilemma of using an ""innocent"" disconnected member of the collective as a vehicle to infect the Borg with a killer virus or to send ""Hugh"" back unharmed?  The next 2 episodes, ""Descent, I & II"" are probably the weakest ones on this whole collection as we get to see Hugh again but with Data getting his loyalties confused due in no small part to the designs of his evil brother.  The plot is weak and the episodes very weak overall but fear not as the other episodes more than make up for this.

We now get Voyager episodes that are among the best ever of the series in ""Scorpion I & II"" which introduces us to Seven of Nine and a species that is actually stronger than the Borg!  Next we get an episode that is very similar to ""I, Borg"" except that ""One"" instead of ""Hugh"" gets to be the star for an episode.  Disc 3 ends with ""Dark Frontier"", where we get to see the Drone Queen in all her dark majesty.

Disc 4 contains both episodes of ""Unimatrix Zero"" where we see Janeway and her crew manage to plant the seeds of dissent and individuality into the collective mind and finally with my favourite Voyager episode, we get ""Endgame"" where Janeway defies Starfleet and goes back into time to secure a better, alternative future for her crew.

All the episodes here are ordered so well and all tell of a very unique element of the Borg while introducing key characters in doing so.  As I'm not a fan of Q and I had to tolerate his appearance on thankfully just the one episode on these discs and as I already have the best time travel and Klingon episodes both here and on TOS and DS9, until they release other themes of Fan Collectives, this Borg Collective is all I need for now.

Very highly recommended!",1147046400,55,2894,4.444234404536862
2457293,5,B000CCBCIA,"I share the same comments as one other viewer. Having a collection like this allows me to view my favorite episodes without having to buy the DVDs of all the different seasons. And the scenes with the Borg are indeed the more thrilling episodes. The ""Best of Both Worlds"" episode to me was the the greatest of the Borg episodes. I can remember watching the first part of that episode, which was the last episode/cliff hanger for the one season. And at the end, Commander Riker asked them to fire at the Borg ship, which had Captain Picard who was asimilated as Locutus. And seeing the ending sent a chill down my spine and I know I couldn't wait to see the conclusion in the next season!

I do have a suggestion though that I would like to see another colletion created which features all of the holodeck episodes. My favorite holodeck episodes are the ones with Data as Sherlock Holmes and with Professor Moriarty as the bad guy. An even more interesting episode with that theme was the one called ""Shp in a Bottle"", where Professor Moriarty created his own holodeck fantasy and led Captain Picard and Data to believe they were on the rest of the ship outside the holodeck, but they really weren't. Another good one I liked was where Commander Whorf and his son pretended to be cowboys, but something happened with the holodeck program and the safety features were not working. And Data was the bad guy and had the ability to kill for real since the safety feature was not working.",1145664000,3,1482,4.550561797752809
2457294,5,B000CCBCIA,"I was a big fan of the Borg from the time of their introduction in the ""Q Who?"" episode from ST:TNG.  For fans of the multiple series who liked the Borg as an adversary (who doesn't?), this DVD set is a great way to experience the best of the Borg episodes.  You get episodes from 3 of the 5 series (ST:TOS and ST:DS9 never had Borg episodes).  Episodes are in Star Date order, so the episode ""Regeneration"" from ST:Enterprise is the 1st one on Disk 1.

Since others have gone into detail on the episodes, I won't repeat them here.  Suffice to say there's plenty of action and personal interplay in the episodes.  For action, check out ""Dark Frontier"", ""Q Who?"", and ""Endgame.""  For personal dynamics and deep thoughts, you have ""I Borg"", ""Drone"", and ""Unimatrix Zero"" Parts 1 & 2.  Some episodes have both, like ""The Best Of Both Worlds"" Parts 1 & 2, with Part 1 having more action and Part 2 having more personal focus.

Once again, it is nice to have the shows shown in their original, uncut version -- most of the episodes last a shade over 45 minutes (in syndication, most are clipped about 2 minutes shorter to allow for more commercials).  There are 14 episodes on the 4 DVDs, including ""Dark Frontier"" which is really a 2-parter in length.  ""Dark Frontier"" marks the introduction of the Borg Queen and is the longest episode/2-parter in the entire Star Trek series (unless ""The Menagerie"" uncut is longer).  It goes just over 1 hour 32 minutes.  ""Dark Frontier"" is often overlooked by Star Trek fans, but I like the interplay between Seven of Nine and Naomi, as well as the personality conflict and debates between Seven and the Borg Queen.  The flashback sequences showing Seven of Nine's human parents, and their incredibly risky study of the Borg when Annika (Seven) was just a child, are also top-notch.

The picture quality of the DVD's is superb.  Pixelation using the DVD zoom feature is minimal.  All episodes are shown in a 4:3 aspect ratio except ""Regeneration"" which is shown in 16:9 Widescreen.  I watched several of the episodes on an HDTV with a progressive scan DVD player and the picture was enhanced even more, though if you have a regular TV and standard DVD player you won't feel you are missing out.

There are not many features in the DVD set, which is not surprising since the purpose was to get fan favorites to the public in an affordable manner.  There are some Text Commentaries by Michael & Denise Okuda on a few of the episodes; I wouldn't have minded additional commentaries by them or other Star Trek producers or writers or actors on the other episodes.  Still, it is what it is and I suspect most people buying the set are buying these to see the action-packed episodes involving the Borg.

All in all, a well-produced set which gives good value for the money.  Star Trek fans did a great job in voting for their favorite Borg episodes and now all can enjoy this selection of top-notch episodes in a nice-looking DVD collection set.

NOTE:  ""Endgame"" is the series finale to Voyager and is also on the Time Travel Fan Collective, FYI.",1145491200,6,3074,4.5963302752293576
2457295,5,B000CCBCIA,"I was never crazy about the Borg, but decided to give this a try.  Even skipping the Enterprise episode and Hugh trilogy as I did, Q Who and BofBW plus the Voyager episodes provided a heaping helping of entertainment value for the money.  I'd frankly forgotten just how good those first three TNG Borg eps were (still refuse to watch the next 3).  I wasn't a regular Voyager viewer, but did see Unimatrix Zero and Endgame when they were on--and those two eps convinced me to buy this set because both are quite fine.  Scorpion, Drone, and Dark Frontier were new to me, and UZ and EG are absolutely as fab as I remember.  What I loved about the Time Travel collective was having TOS eps added, and I didn't intend to buy this--but at the end of the day, the Borg story arc does make for an excellent dvd collection.  Sure it's bare bones with no extras, but for all the dvds in my collection, the only extras I watch more than once are gag reels anyway, so no extras didn't bug me much.  Sure Endgame is repeated here--but toss in Year in Hell from Time Travel and you have a very nice Seven of Nine marathon if you're partial to that character.  Following up Q Who and Best of Both Worlds with Family and the Drumhead from the Picard collection makes for another nice rainy day.",1145491200,2,1278,4.340336134453781
2457296,5,B000CCBCIA,"The collective compilation is, possibly, Paramount's best format for the respective shows based on the ideas of the late visionary, Gene Roddenberry.  While purists may scoff at the concept, often reproducing episodes that share common content, these issues provide the best of the show in an economical packaging that fits the pocketbook.

The Borg, introduced in the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" installment, ""Q Who,"" have provided the franchise with some of the most intense and thoroughly engaging stories.

This particular compilation has episodes from the late ""Enterprise,"" ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" and ""Voyager.""  As one that was unable to see the last five years of ""Voyager,"" due to the fact that UPN was not provided by my cable service provider, I was in Trek heaven when I got the set with the Borg episodes.

As far as the episodes are concerned, there is no filler here. ""The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II,"" (arguably one of the finest in ST: TNG's history), ""Scorpion, Parts I and II,"" and ""Endgame"" possess state-of-the-art special effects and bravura acting from the respective cast members, along with superb guest turns from Susanna Thompson (as the ""Borg Queen"" in four episodes), Jonathan del Arco (""I, Borg"" and ""Descent, Part II""), Alice Krige (reprising her ""Borg Queen"" role from ""Star Trek: First Contact"") and veteran character actor John Rhys-Davies as ""Leonardo da Vinci"".

Kudos must also be given to the part II of ""Descent,"" one of the few episodes wherein Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) takes the helm of the Enterprise and must serve as acting captain.

Even these few glimpses into the seven-year long run of ""Voyager"" shows why Kate Mulgrew's ""Kathryn Janeway"" is, possibly, one of the best actors to appear as a ship captain in the forty-plus long history of the franchise.",1145059200,2,1836,5.03960396039604
2457297,4,B000CCBCIA,"I am as big a Star Trek fan as the next person. But I've always gagged on the horrendous prices of the full-season box sets. I watched Star Trek: The Next Generation religiously when it first was on the air, but now, large chunks of it seems dated. And badly-written. And cheesy. Not in a good way. But a lot of it was really good, too. So I'm happy to pay for the good stuff, as long as they don't make me watch the The Game, The First Duty, or most of Season 7 ever again. And while I liked Voyager and Deep Space 9 in spots, and would enjoy watching some of those episodes again, there is absolutely no freaking way I'm paying what they're asking to get ahold of them currently.

So now we get these ""fan collectives"". The episodes aren't exclusively the best of Trek - the Borg got over-used towards the end, and the two Time's Arrows episodes (from the time travel set) are about the 101st and 102nd best Next Generation episodes. There is some minor duplication amongst the sets. And those text commentaries have to be about the lamest special feature ever. But the sets are comparatively cheap, and they have episodes that are generally good at the very least (with a number of really outstanding ones in there), and for someone who likes Trek but isn't obsessive, having 14 solid episodes drawn primarily from The Next Generation but also from Voyager (and Deep Space 9 and the original series on the other sets) gives a nice variety for those of us who want an occasional Star Trek fix but don't want to sit through an entire season of episodes of hugely varying quality.

Fan polling may not exactly be the ultimate arbiter of quality. The hard-core fans who vote on these things have different tastes than the wider world (which I assume explains the inclusion of Time's Arrow). But given how badly Paramount has lost touch with reality in the management of the who Star Trek enterprise (as evidenced by the most-recent-series-which-will-go-unnamed, which started out appallingly bad and then proceeded to get worse), I'll take it.",1144368000,3,2042,4.622589531680441

2457299,4,B000CCBCIA,"This collection revolves around the `Borg', and is devoted to The Next Gen and Voyager- although the opening episodes are from the Enterprise series.  It is hard going from the widescreen digital format of Enterprise and then back to the old-school format of the two older series- I think it tends to emphasis how much special effects have advanced, but it also detracts a little from The Next Gen and Voyager.  Additionally, this is a whole lot of Borg episodes- if you are only going to purchase one of these collections, get the `Time Travel', I think it has more variety within its theme.  But, obviously, if you are all about getting a Borg fix, then this is the set for you, hands down.

These lower priced boxed sets are a good way to review all your old favorites from the various trek series. You avoid two of the pitfalls found in the alternative of purchasing all individual seasons: firstly, even at a reduced price, you will end up spending considerably more on individual seasons; secondly, having a bookshelf devoted to startrek is not always socially the wisest course of action. For those who make the leap and fully indulge in their passion for Trek, I make no judgments. Personally, I would like to enjoy my sci-fi fix with a little bit more subtlety than a 28 season marathon in my room and few more dollars in my pocket.

The episodes chosen seem to capture the theme of each boxed set very well, and it would be nice to see a ""Startrek: Classics"" set with no particular theme, just those good episodes that were fun to watch.

I will fault the selections for the overlap that is present in each theme. I'm not positive, but I don't think you can purchase any two sets without re-purchasing at least one episode.",1144108800,2,1733,4.574193548387097

2457301,5,B000CCBCIA,"Sorry, but it's more a waste to buy seasons 4 and 5 of Voyager just to get ""Scorpion"" and a bunch of episodes I'll never watch again.  Amongst TNG season sets 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7...  And I never cared for TNG 5 and 6 anyway...

I think it's great Paramount is releasing such amalgamation sets.

This one is Borg-specific and contains most of the stories featuring the Borg.  Pity the one with the Dreadnought wasn't included as that features an alien who wants revenge on Janeway for inadvertantly introducing his species to the Borg (oops!)  But no real complaints otherwise.

All the stories are here:

* That Enterprise episode that breaks continuity.

TNG stories:

* Q Who (the story that truly introduces the Borg and sets up situations in later TNG and Voyager stories of which we're reminded it's Q who did the real work...)

* The Best of Both Worlds (no words needed, it's the best)

* I, Borg (feeble, illogical preaching)

* Descent (the worst of the lot given it's self-mockery, silly when not psychotic dialogue, atrocious acting, and self-parody - and Picard isn't even demoted for his blunder from his idiocy in ""I, Borg""!)

VOYAGER stories:

* Scorpion (a very competent 2-parter)

* Drone (a fascinating, if not altogether superior version of ""I, Borg"")

* Dark Frontier (let's copy that movie's camera angles and scribble in a plot, but it's okay otherwise)

* Unimatrix Zero

* Endgame (a fascinating, if not slightly flawed finale that ends on two good notes.

The episodes look very good in video quality.  Sound quality is great, especially in 5.1.

Those who are fans enough to like certain villains or collections without wanting to spend $1400 for the entire TNG and VOYAGER box sets just to get all the Borg stories plus another 380+ stories, half of which aren't any good will undoubtedly prefer this set.

Also look out for the Q set coming in June (why not sooner?  Q is too popular to be held back for so long...)  While we get some duplicates (chiefly Q-Who), it's not that bothersome to me.

Let's hope they have a Picard II set and Data set coming out.

2457302,1,B000CCBCIA,"Ok, I understand everyone's opinion about how great this is for someone who doesn't own (or can't afford) the seasons, and I agree. However, for people like me who do own all 28 seasons, 10 ""Special Edition"" movies (that I have already bought twice because I also owned the single disc versions that they released first), this would be an absolute waste of money. In my opinion, Paramount is simply trying to make up for the shortsightedness of canceling Enterprise.

Sure, the first season of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" was a slow start and the second season (although better), wasn't much to write home about. The third and forth seasons were not only much better but more along the lines of what true ""Star Trek"" is all about. It showed us history and explanations for things in the Star Trek universe that had never been explained before. Now, I'm sure that because of the serialized nature of the last 2 seasons, the ratings may have fell a little because not everyone owns a DVR and once you miss an episode, and you're lost. Big deal! You can't tell me they didn't sell enough DVD sets to make up for the ratings.

Now, for the first time in years, there is no new Star Trek, and no new income. Not only for Paramount but also probably a lot of the behind the scenes staff as well. In the meantime they are releasing these ""collectives"" in hopes that the die hard fans, like myself, will buy them, because I think I have to own it all. Well not this time! Like I said above, I have already bought the movies twice because they didn't put any specials on the first set. I'm not about to spend money on the same episodes I already own, not to mention the fact that there are episodes that appear on more than one of these ""collectives"".

If Paramount wants to continue the ""Star Trek"" revenue, they should release new material. Unlike a lot of people, I enjoyed ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" and would love to see movies released about Voyager's return to earth, or what happened to Deep Space Nine's people after the war was over, or anything else NEW that Paramount could come up with.

Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) must deal with this unknown menace as the Borg proceed to try take a Federation vessel and assimilate his doctor. Next we get ""Q Who?"" the episode that introduced the Borg. The all powerful Q challenges Captain Picard's assertive statement that they don't need his help to get out of jams by flinging them across the galaxy to their first encounter with the Borg. Unprepared, outgunned and with the Enterprise being carved apart by the Borg Picard must decide whether or not he wants to swallow his pride and call on Q to help them escape. ""The Best of Both Worlds"" is a two part episode and, perhaps, Next Gen's finest hour. Written by the late Michael Piller, the Borg finally arrive and begin assimiliating entire worlds as they move towards Earth. Picard and his crew must stop the Borg but not before a key member of the Enterprise crew is kidnapped and turned into a Borg against his will threatening the Federation and all of humanity!

""I Borg"" humanizes the Borg a bit. The Enterprise receives a distress call and when they arrive to help they discover the lone survivor of a crashed ship is a Borg Drone. As he spends time with the crew he wants to explore his individuality. Picard is torn because Star Fleet wants to use ""Hugh"" as a weapon to destroy the collective. ""Descent"" is another two part episode in which Lore Data's ""brother"" trains Borg cut off from the collective to serve him. It seems that Picard's plan to reintroduce Hugh the young Borg they saved in ""I Borg"" has worked all too well introducing the concept of individuality but at a terrible cost.

The Voyager episodes featuring the Borg were among the finest the show produced. Starting with ""Scorpion"" we're introduced to 7 of 9 (Jeri Ryan)and a war brewing between Species 8472 creatures from fluidic space (from another dimension)as alien as the crew has ever encountered. Janeway agrees to help the Borg develop a weapon against the creatures in return for safe passage through the quadrant. When the crew terminate their agreement with the Borg 7 of 9 is trapped aboard Voyager. She slowly begins to rediscover her humanity. In ""Drone"" A transporter accident causes the advanced circutry of the doctor's mobile emitter to combine with Borg technology creating an advanced drone who calls himself One. In the two part ""Dark Frontier"" Captain Janeway decides to steal a transwarp coil from a Borg ship that would allow them to get home faster. 7 of 9 volunteers for the mission but elects to stay with the Borg. In ""Unimatrix Zero"" 7 of 9 discovers there's a collective ""dream"" where Borg meet to explore their individuality. Her involvement with these people threatens Voyager. In the final two hour grand finale for Voyager ""Endgame"" Admiral Janeway travels back to the past to offer Captain Janeway technology from the future that will allow Voyager to get home quicker. While her reasons for doing so are somewhat mysterious Captain Janeway accepts her offer. Unfortunately the Borg detect the technology and want it for themselves.

This set has text commentary tracks on ""The Best of Both Worlds Parts 1 & 2"" by Michael and Denise Okuda as well as on ""Unimatrix Zero Part 2"". There's also the original commentary track by writers Mike Sussman and Phyllis Strong on ""Regeneration"". There aren't any featurettes or documentaries on this set. A pity that there aren't any audio commentary tracks for the other ""Next Generation"" episodes. You'll notice that there aren't any ""Deep Space: Nine"" episodes here because the Borg didn't really appear on the show.

This is a great place to get your ""Star Trek"" fix with the show's most memorable villans. Image quality varies quite a bit as these feature the exact same transfers as the original boxed sets but overall they look pretty good. Only ""Enterprise"" is presented in widescreen and actually looks the best of all the series here simply because it's the most recent.",1142726400,154,4493,4.869281045751634

8097355,4,B000CCBCIA,"If you love the Borg characters, this is a VERY GOOD collection. It would be great IF it included every ST episode that included the Borg storyline so that you could trace the development of the relationships. For example, their only appearance on DSN is not included: ""Emissary,"" and Voyager has several missing episodes: ""Blood Fever"" (their first appearance), an episode about Borg children titled ""Collective,"" and ""Q2.""",1520726400,,424,5.25
