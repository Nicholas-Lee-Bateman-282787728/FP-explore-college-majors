8439916,5,B004SKJYGY,"It was UFC 87, and on the preliminary card, HIS ONLY PRELIMINARY CARD, and his UFC debut, Jon ""Bones"" Jones made his UFC debut with an impressive showing against an experienced Andre Gusmao. At UFC 94, UFC Brass gave Jones a test in Stephan Bonnar, and Bones would once again go to town. At the TUF Heavyweights Finale, unfortunately, due to ""illegal elbows,"" Jones would suffer his 1st and only loss, a disqualification to Matt Hamill, who was clearly at a loss for the offense Jones came at him with. Brandon Vera and Vladimir Matyushenko were lined up in Main Event Fight Nights, only to get owned, and owned badly and quickly! And I think fans were still convinced that Jones hadn't fought anybody with caliber just yet. So at UFC 126, they gave him TUF 8 Light Heavyweight Winner, Ryan Bader, who came into the fight undefeated. Well, Jones left the octagon undefeated after that fight, in impressive fashion, and with a whole new challenge on his hands. He was being offered a title shot against Mauricio ""Shogun"" Rua at this event, UFC 128. And whether or not Rashad Evans liked that or not, this was the Main Event!

Everybody who's a fan of MMA knows exactly who Urijah Faber is! Everybody was waiting for this moment to arrive, for Urijah Faber to step onto the biggest stage on the planet, the UFC octagon! This is his UFC debut, against Eddie Wineland.

With those 2 being headliners, what more could you ask for? 12 fights in all, that's what! And I'll list 'em all below for you.

Raphael Assuncao vs. Erik Koch: Both scrappy competitors, both ready for the big show. One of them gets a beautiful 1st round KO!

Nick Catone vs. Costa Philippou: New Jersey takes on a member of Serra's team! Philippou was derailed after dominating Joseph Henle on TUF, but he's still getting his chance. Catone is one tough son-of-a-gun. Good scrap that goes to a unanimous decision.

Joseph Benavidez vs. Ian Loveland: Both of these guys bring a lot of scrap to the octagon, and one of them earns an impressive unanimous decision!

Kurt Pelligrino vs. Gleison Tibau: This is simply one of those scraps that when the dust settles, you have to choose a winner! And that's about the truth because it's a great fight, and a split decision in the end.

Ricardo Almeida vs. Mike Pyle: If you had to choose 2 fighters to define the words ""crafty veterans"" then these 2 would immediately fit the bill. They both come to bring it, and one of them gets a unanimous decision.

Edson Barboza vs. Anthony Njokuani: Barboza proved how lethal his all around game is, not to mention his leg kicks in his UFC 123 debut against Lullo. Njokuani comes to the cage as a great striker, and no joke to previous opponents. What wins this fight is LITERALLY in the final 10 seconds of the fight, it IS the FIGHT OF THE NIGHT, and this is an impressive battle for all 3 rounds! Unanimous decision, and a GREAT FIGHT!

Luiz Cane vs. Eliot Marshall: Cane loves to stand and bang, and Marshall isn't too bad himself. But one of these guys get owned badly, and somewhat quickly with a 1st round TKO in the 1st!

Mirko Cro Cop vs. Brendan Schaub: They both love to stand and bang, and they're both equally tough. One of them gets a 3rd round KO, thanking his hero for being the reason he started MMA in the first place!

Nate Marquardt vs. Dan Miller: When Akiyama couldn't make it due to weather conditions, Dan Miller took his place for Marquardt's final battle in the octagon. It goes to a unanimous decision that wasn't all that impressive, and hopefully Nate learned some kind of lesson after his little stunt.

Jim Miller vs. Kamal Shalorus: Coming in undefeated, Shalorus is without a doubt, a threat. But is he that big of a threat to Jersey's own Jim Miller? The answer to that is a 3rd round TKO!

Urijah Faber vs. Eddie Wineland: The winner earns a title shot with a unanimous decision! Welcome to the UFC, ""The California Kid,"" Urijah Faber!

Shogun Rua vs. Jon Jones: If this was a test, then don't tell Jones that. Incredible performance against a veteran like Shogun! New champion, so line 'em up!!

And eventually, the war with Rashad begins. But I'm not so sure that Rashad's taking this one.",1332806400,,4176,4.556742323097463
8439917,5,B004SKJYGY,"I thought it possible that Jones would be in the cage with someone who would take him apart.  Jones exceeded my wildest dreams.  It is exciting when there is a paradigm shift.  Royce did it.  The sport has evolved impressively, but generally along the same lines.  Now boom.  Everyone can learn BJJ.  But no one is built like Jones, so how do the fighters learn if their builds are the same.  This will be fascinating to watch.",1302048000,2,427,4.454545454545454
