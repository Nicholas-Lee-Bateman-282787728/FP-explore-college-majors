8109452,5,B000EGEKPG,"One of my all-time favorites. Each time I do it I like it more. I consider myself advanced and own everything from Cathe to Amy, Jari to Christi, you name it, I have it but I only keep the best. It must be challenging, varied and fun and this one fits the bill perfectly. Love it!",1240790400,,280,4.017857142857143
8109453,5,B000EGEKPG,"This is a fantastic workout.  Kimberly is becoming a fast favourite instructor of mine.  Each workout of hers is really good and very effective.
This workout is kick box inspired, but it also includes step aerobics, standing floor toning work and floor cardio.  This is pretty much non stop from start to end (it's actually quite unusall that she's called this Kick Box boot camp because the kickboxing aspect isn't there throughout like you'd think).  This is definately high energy and you'll have a lot of fun with it and burn calories quickly.  While it's easy to follow because the moves aren't tough to do, it's still challenging.  This workout ends with a routine that's for your core strength and balance.  She is a great cuer so that's very helpful so you know what's coming up and you're prepared for it.
All up, from beginning to end, it's a little under an hour and I highly recommend it because of the fun aspect and the great results you'll get if you stick to it for a little while.  All you need is dumbells and a body bar and you are good to go.  I really enjoy this dvd and have begun to incorporate it into my regular dvd workouts.  I haven't got bored with it yet and it's well worth buying and trying.",1183766400,2,1222,4.439461883408072
8109454,5,B000EGEKPG,"I bought this DVD when it was first released and I still find it provides solid workout.  I like my workouts to be varied from day to day so this is a nice change from hi-lo, step and kickboxing.  For the purposes of this video, I think an 8 lb body bar provides sufficient resistance.  This DVD is great for an overall cardio and strength training workout for the days you're not looking to kill yourself trying to get through an intense video (ie Cathe's high intensity workouts--which are also very good by the way).  I own several of Kimberly's DVDs just cause I love her cueing and the flowing transitions of her workouts.  She has a few straight up kickboxing workouts that are worth checking out.",1171152000,8,703,4.503937007874016
8109455,3,B000EGEKPG,"I've only done this workout twice thus far (once with the step and once without), so these are my initial thoughts.  Doing the workout the first time (without the step or body bar, but with hand weights), I didn't care much for it.  While Kimberly Spreen isn't (thankfully) one of those super-perky exercise instructors, I also didn't find her very warm or engaging.  She came off more like an Army drill instructor than someone I want to be having fun working out with.

Being that I am a huge fan of kickboxing workouts, I was a bit disappointed that this workout was a lot more ""boot camp"" than it was ""kickbox.""  On the other hand, I definitely appreciated that Spreen included two arm movements (in addition to the jab, cross, hook and upper cut) that none of my other kickboxing workouts include.

When I did the workout a second time with the step, it was substantially more aerobically challenging than without the step.  I had to revert to side steps or marching a few times when I got out of breath from the constant up and down off the step.  I was sweating so hard that I had to mop my face several times during the workout so I could see!  There is some excellent (and not your garden variety) core and toning work included that is also tough.  I did the body bar section the second time with a broom handle subbing for a weighted body bar.  Even though I didn't get as much benefit with a lightweight broom handle, I still thought that segment was effective.

So my bottom line is that, while it is a challenging cardio AND toning workout, I just didn't find it much fun.  If it's not fun, I'm not going to keep doing it and that means it isn't a good bet for a purchase (I have it on rental right now).",1145836800,13,1717,4.344827586206897
8109456,4,B000EGEKPG,"This is basically a cardio sculpt/aerobic weight training workout which uses a step (placed in a vertical position), light hand weights (for punching), and a body bar (for strength moves). I don't have a full step, so I substituted the bottom (blue) section of my Fanny Lifter. This worked fine, although next time, I think I would be better off using the shorter (purple) top section; I also think you could forgo the step entirely and do the workout on the floor, especially the cardio segments. I used an unweighted dowel for the body bar, but I don't think this provided enough resistance (even though I was wearing my 1-lb. weighted gloves), so next time, I might try dumbbells instead.

The workout begins with a 5-minute basic warmup; instructor Kimberly Spreen spends a lot of time warming up your shoulders in particular since you'll use these muscles a lot during the workout. Next comes 25 minutes of cardio sculpt. Kimberly uses the step to add intensity at times, but the impact is still fairly minimal. The simple choreography includes punches, bob-n-weaves, side steps, lunges, knee lifts, and a single knee-kick move. The cardio segment segues into about 10 minutes of more toning-specific moves using the bar, including a fun block move, squats, rows, planks/push-ups using the step, and lunges onto the step. Next is 8 minutes of core/abs work, mostly oblique moves while seated on the step with balance v-sits between each set. I was a bit disappointed in the core work, as I didn't feel it was very intense, but I liked that Kimberly included some balance moves. Kimberly finishes the workout with a 9-minute segment that includes some nice lower body stretches (again using the step) and a Tai Chi-like cool-down, which brings the workout in at about 57 minutes total.

In general, I liked this workout, although there were a few disappointments. First of all, I wore my heart rate monitor the entire time, but it showed that I was only in my target zone for about 15 minutes, which was frustrating since I did feel like I was working hard. It's possible that because this was my first time with the video and I was just learning the moves, this may have affected my HR, so I'm hoping that my time in zone numbers will improve. Also, as mentioned above, I didn't feel that the core work was very intense, so I'd be inclined just to skip it in the future (luckily, the DVD is chaptered, so this would be easy to do). Finally, although Kimberly was a good instructor and cued well overall, there were times when she slipped up a bit-e.g., at one point she cued ""upright row"" when she meant ""front raise."" She also has a tendency to be a bit goofy in her comments, although she does come across as very down-to-earth.

In summary, this is a solid cardio sculpt workout, and I'm hoping to get greater cardio intensity from it in the future.",1145232000,7,2857,4.687250996015936
