2703433,5,B000LC4C0Q,"I have been waiting for decades to get ""The Old Fashioned Way"" on first VHS and then DVD. To my knowledge, it is the only time his famous and historic juggling routine was recorded on film. I once saw a performer who had mastered WC's cigar box juggling, and he was very careful to inform the audience about the bit's creator, Wolchester Cowperthwaite Fields!

I finally got a bootleg copy on e-bay from a guy in Florida. He had taped it off television on one of its rare showings. But, to now have DVD with closed captioning to catch every mumble, it's heaven.",1174694400,,561,4.446601941747573
2703434,5,B000LC4C0Q,"So now we have vol 2 coming up. That's great! It still doesn't cover all of his films! What about ""If I Had a Million""(1932),(never released on video!) or ""Million Dollar Legs""(1932)?

I never understand the haphazard way in which classic films with big name stars are released/non-released. Who decides and how? Why would the current owners of these properties NOT release these films for DVD sale? If you owned a Garbo film, would you keep it in the can?! What good does it do there? At the current rate of release, we could see the majority of 1930's film production to be in full video release in about 15 years... Make sense to you? Not to me. This set consists of titles that should have been released YEARS ago on DVD.

There is no marketing plan in evidence for any classic film property. People love owning the rights to these films, but nobody seems to know how to peddle them to a new generation of viewers and consumers. Hence these films are primarily being bought by people who already know about them and purposely seek them out. Not a strategy for growth.

Buy this set. Vol 1 was good, and I'm sure vol 2 will be just as good. Those of us who love this stuff must support it with our dollars- otherwise the powers that be will be even more diffident about this material then they already are.",1172102400,14,1309,4.445833333333334
2703435,5,B000LC4C0Q,"I was delighted to find this today on my Recommended list, as I had not heard anything about it.  I was so excited when volume 1 was announced, primarily because there hadn't been a decent dvd copy of ""It's a Gift"", but also because I was hoping beyond hope that there would some day be a volume 2 that included TMOTFTrapeze, and The Old Fashioned Way.  Trapeze, especially, is on my must see list, and almost instantly alienates me from the uninitiated of my generation.  It usually takes some cajoling, but when I finally get friends to take time out to drink in a Field's picture, they usually get turned in the right direction permanently.

The scene where Fields trips, crashes through the door and down the cellar stairs, shoots himself in the posterior, pulls from under him a piece of wood with a ridiculously long nail in it, and utters ""Drat"", is usually enough to get the job done for good.  Just thinking about it, I am having a difficult time restraining my laughter as I type.

The movie was never one of his most popular, but it is riddled with small and incredibly funny gags.  His constant ""brushing his teeth"", the dialog with his shrew of a wife (hideously played by Kathleen Howard, in a role that she more or less reprised a few times with Fields) regarding a late night wrong number, Fields's comment on hearing burglars singing in his cellar (""Oh, what rotten voices""), his subsequent joining in with the singing burglars (one of them played by a very young Walter Brennan), and his following appearance in court are incredibly well crafted.  I think that this flick may be the best example of the Fields wit, but you have to pay close attention to the movie to really pick up on it.  His expressions and under-the-breath comments are truly one-of-a-kind, and turn him into more than just a cliche.

""The Old Fashioned Way"" is another great example of a Fields vehicle that never quite got the attention it deserved.  Probably most famous for a kick that the Great Man delivers to Baby LeRoy, it is also filled with great little scenes that show off W.C.'s versatility.  The play, his juggling, his throw away lines all make this a very entertaining entry.  Keep an eye open for a truly great supporting role by Jan Duggan as ""Cleopatra Pepperday"".

Never Give a Sucker an Even Break and You're Telling Me are both amusing,
but were never at the very top of my Fields list (although the scene in YTM where he shoots the tires on the police car is pretty darned funny).

Poppy is one that, I have a hard time believing myself, I've never seen.  I've read some pretty good things about it, so I'm looking forward to the viewing.

All in all, I am much, much happier this afternoon than I was this morning, thanks to finding this announcement!",1171411200,16,2763,4.572008113590264
2703436,5,B000LC4C0Q,"I'd written a review of the first volume of Fields films and the gist was that MCA had packaged a good deal of previously released product.  Now MCA has finally come clean.  At last here are the true classics of the Great Man's film career.  Eternal thanks for the Paramount selections....and Never Give a Sucker An Even Break ain't bad, either.

2703438,5,B000LC4C0Q,"FINALLY!!!!

My favorite Fields movie on DVD!  I have only had an awful, recorded from TV version, with horrible quality to watch. I can't wait.  For any Fields fans out there who have not seen this movie, it is great!  The others will all be great too, but I am buying this DVD for just one movie!",1170720000,3,298,4.175438596491228
2703439,5,B000LC4C0Q,"It's about time these films are available on DVD. They are long overdue!

""The Old Fashioned Way"" is as good a picture of the bygone days of Vaudeville as exists anywhere, to say nothing of being the only available footage of the great man's cigar box juggling routine. ""Poppy"" is a comedy milestone with Fields portraying Larson E. Whipsnade, the quintessential carny. The ping pong scene is timeless! ""Never Give a Sucker An Even break"" is packed with laughs and a great example of how Field's mind went beyond the ordinary bounds of comedies of his era to open the door for later films like ""Being John Malkovitch"". ""You're telling me"" has many memorable scenes bringing us to the main event: ""Man On The Flying Trapeze"". This is quite frankly the most underrated film of his career. I'll never forget The synopsized New York Times review of this film that appeared in the TV pages when I was a kid: ""A man besieged and a man to remember!"" The older I get the more I relate to Ambrose Woolfinger! The parking ticket scene is the definition of perfect. It still brings tears to my eyes. When he takes a swing at his mother in law, Mrs. Nestlerode, it's not for the faint of heart. A person could literally die laughing! As fate would have it, I happened to watch that film tonight, before I made my weekly check of websites to see if any more Fields was on the way and Lo and Behold I learned that March 20th 2007 is to be a day of celebration.

For far too long, much of Field's greatest work has been conspicuous in it's absence from the marketplace. It's nice to know more of these gems are finally on the way! Now, if we live long enough, we may yet see ""Missisippi"", ""Tillie and Gus"", ""If I had a Million"", ""Million Dollar legs"", The Old Army Game and ""Six Of a Kind"" (Though available on Burns & Allen Collections) & ""The Big Broadcast of 1938"" (Bob Hope Collection) as well as Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch"", ""Sensations"" & other missing Fields films, available on future DVD collections as well.

Saving the world will take more than reversing global warming. It will take reversing mediocrity In art as well as politics! A good start is making available entertainment where wit, physical dexterity and clever use of language rules, as opposed to the overhyped tripe Hollywood routinely serves up to a mass audience it perceives, perhaps correctly, (Though I choose not to believe it), as being thick, uneducated and disinterested in anything filmed in glorious Black and White!

I say: ""A thing worth having is worth waiting for! Hope springs eternal! Build it and they will come!""
These films are national treasures. Watch often, laugh hard and live longer!

Sincerely, Henry Gross",1167868800,51,2695,4.629707112970712
2703440,5,B000LC4C0Q,"It's been a long wait for the second installment in the Field's collections but FINALLY we have another, the choices are superb,excellent and I'm like a kid in a candy shop just waiting for the release!

 Man On The Flying Trapeze, Old Fashioned Way and Poppy have never been officially released in any format before so this is just GREAT! All of these movies are superb, this is a MUST BUY for anyone with an interest in old classics (as was the first Field's collection). Some folks questioned the contents of the first collection. I personally liked the choices and now this second collection starts to fill things out very nicely.

Now comes the problem...we absolutely need a third collection, chances are if it happens it would be the last, so how to fill that out? PLEASE don't repeat what's available already, 6 Of a Kind, The Big Broadcast of 1938 and David Copperfield ARE avalable on DVD.

What we desperately need is Mississippi, Tillie And Gus, Her Majesty Love, Million Dollar Legs. I also think Tales Of Manhattan should be included as the VHS is now out of print and Fields part in there is superb. Also, If I Had a Million would be nice.

What else besides those becomes problematic. perhaps a 4th collection of silents, The Old Army Game, Sally Of The Sawdust(uncut)& Running Wild.

Then there's the remaining bit parts movies, I don't think we'll see these in a Fields collection so you hardcore fans will have to watch and see if they come out alone. Alice In Wonderland(1933)(never released), Song Of The Open Road(never released), Sensations Of 1945(available on VHS), Follow The Boys(available on VHS).

Strong sales of this may help a 3rd collection to happen, so buy 1 for yourself, and a few as gifts!",1166745600,71,1727,4.717607973421927
2703441,5,B000LC4C0Q,"The Great Man is back with Volume Two of the fantastic W.C. Fields Comedy Collection. Titles included are:

THE MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE (1935) -

Ambrose Wolfinger wants the afternoon off (his first in twenty-five years) to go to a wrestling match. He tells his boss that he must attend his mother-in-law's funeral. The afternoon is no joy. He tries to please a policeman, assist a chauffeur, chase a tire, and ends up getting hit by the body of a wrestler thrown from the ring. A series of mishaps leads his boss to send floral tributes to the house and notify the papers of the death (due to poisoned liquor). His shrewish wife, judgmental mother-in-law, and good-for-nothing brother-in-law add to his burdens. In the end he enjoys their fawning loyalty, a raise in pay, and his first vacation.

NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK (1941) -

Fields wants to sell a film story to Esoteric Studios. On the way he gets insulted by little boys, beat up for ogling a woman, and abused by a waitress. He becomes his niece's guardian when her mother is killed in a trapeze fall during the making of a circus movie. He and his niece, who he finds at a shooting gallery, fly to Mexico to sell wooden nutmegs in a Russian colony. Trying to catch his bottle as it falls from the plane, he lands on a mountain peak where lives the man- eating Mrs. Hemogloben. When he gets to the Russian colony he finds Leon Errol (father of the insulting boys and owner of the shooting gallery) already selling wooden nutmegs. He decides to woo the wealthy Mrs. Hemogloben but when he gets there Errol has preceded him. The Mexican adventure is the story that Esoteric Studios would not buy.

YOU'RE TELLING ME (1934) -

Sam Bisbee is an inventor whose works (e.g., a keyhole finder for drunks) have brought him only poverty. His daughter is in love with the son of the town snob. Events conspire to ruin his bullet-proof tire just as success seems near. Another of his inventions prohibits him from committing suicide, so Sam decides to go on living..

THE OLD FASHIONED WAY (1934) -

The Great McGonigle's traveling theatrical troupe are staying at a boarding house. They are preparing to put on a production of ""The Drunkard"" (and do so during this movie). Cleopatra Pepperday puts up money for the show provided she can have a part (""Here comes the prince!""). Little Albert Wendelschaffer torments McGonigle all through lunch (""How can you hurt a watch by dipping it in molasses?""). In spite of being pursued by several sheriffs, McGonigle is able to keep going and see his daughter Betty happily married.

POPPY (1936) -

Poppy, daughter of carnival medicine salesman Professor McGargle, falls in love with the Mayor's son. Countess Maggie Tubbs DePuizzi is claimant to the Putnam estates, but McGargle and lawyer Wiffen plot to make Poppy claim the fortune. Wiffen and the Countess double-cross the Professor, but kindly Sarah Tucker notices a resemble between Poppy and the deceased Mrs. Putnam. It turns out that McGargle adopted the girl, she is the rightful heir, the purported Countess is only a showgirl, and every one has a happy ending.

This set is shaping up to be every bit as fine as first one released in 2004. Not expecting it to be heavily laden with extras, this is Universal we're dealing with. Likely to be superb prints but even Volume One only had trailers and a documentary.",1165795200,41,3376,4.695431472081219

2703521,5,B000LC4C0Q,"The Fields formula comprises two different characters.  One is the pompous and grandiloquent small time misanthropic con artist, who is usually an entertainer with some traveling show.  This is exemplified by his famous phrase of never giving a sucker an even break.  The other and now more popular one is the bumbling henpecked husband who is always trying to sneak in a drink.  In both cases there is always a pretty daughter or niece of marriageable age.

The best movie is probably the 1935 movie The Man on the Flying Trapeze.  Here Fields has a shrewish wife and an even more abusive mother in law who both detest alcohol.  Fields has set up an apple cider (applejack) still in his dingy basement but the women know nothing about it.  Burglars break into the basement, start drinking the cider, and then start singing.  The wife has Fields call the police and go down to the basement to investigate.  The most memorable scene results when Fields, a policeman, and the burglars end up drinking and singing together.

As usual Fields never has a regular job and here is a memory expert for a company president, where he memorizes details about all of the clients so that the president can discuss them when he meets them.  Fields has not had a day off for 25 years but wants an afternoon off when a big wrestling match comes to town.  He gets the afternoon off by falsely claiming that he must attend his mother in law's funeral.  This story eventually backfires and Fields is fired.  But then the president realizes that he cannot manage without Fields.

In the 1934 film You're Telling Me, Fields is an inventor who has been trying to perfect a puncture-proof tire for twenty years.  Buster Crabbe (of Flash Gordon fame) is the son of the town's wealthiest family and is pursuing Fields' daughter.  The man's mother is against any engagement but relents when she discovers that Fields' wife is descended from a prominent Confederate family.  Then she meets Fields and any engagement is definitely off.  Meanwhile, Fields accidentally runs into a European princess on a train.  She befriends him and creates a Cinderella-type plot when she visits his home town to rescue him from his predicaments.  The most memorable scene is when Fields takes about ten minutes to hit a golf ball.

The obscure 1934 film In The Old Fashioned Way takes place sometime in the late 19th century, where Fields wears spats and horseless carriages are a novelty.  Fields is the manager of a traveling theater troupe which is always one step ahead of creditors and the law.  The troupe enters a small town and Fields tries to con the wealthiest widow there.  The movie features a long melodramatic play by Fields' troupe which is apparently a parody of 19th century plays but modern audiences may have difficulty appreciating the humor as the underlying story with Fields is just as melodramatic.

At the end of the play Fields displays his juggling skills, which apparently got him into show business to begin with.  The best scene in the movie is when Fields tricks a hotel owner into letting him escape without paying the bill.  Fields is more of a con artist in this film and there is no happy ending where he overcomes all obstacles.

The obscure 1936 film Poppy is also set in the past, specifically in 1883.  Here  Fields is a con artist who is an entertainer with a traveling carnival.  Poppy is his pretty daughter who is a singer.  When the carnival visits a small town, Fields performs with his daughter, sells snake oil, and sees whom he can swindle.  When he learns that a local fortune has been left for a long-vanished heiress, he forges a document to show that the heiress is his daughter but this backfires.  The Cinderella theme re-emerges with the son of the town's mayor pursuing Fields' daughter even though she is a carnival girl.  This one has a happy ending.  This is apparently the first time Fields utters his phrase of never giving a sucker an even break.

Despite the title of this 1941 film Never Give a Sucker an Even Break, Fields is less antagonistic here than in other films.  The movie is set on a mythical studio lot which was undoubtedly Universal Studios.  Fields' pretty young niece is the singer Gloria Jean.  There is no nagging wife here but the waitress at the local restaurant is onto Fields and plays the same role.

Here Fields is promoting a screenplay to a producer and the scenes from this movie within a movie take up most of the movie.  It is probably the silliest Fields plot which starts out with Fields jumping out of a plane to retrieve a bottle of liquor he accidentally dropped from a plane window.  He lands on the top of a hill which is supposed to be in Russia but looks more like the Alps.  There he finds a pretty young girl who has never seen a man, having been secluded there by her mother, played by Margaret Dumont of Marx Brothers fame, because she doesn't trust men.  When Fields learns the mother is rich, he pursues her for marriage.  This cold weather place is populated by gorillas and monkeys which do not live there today.

At the end Fields performs a mad car ride through Los Angeles while transporting a female passenger.  The middle aged woman wants to visit her daughter at a maternity hospital but Fields thinks she is the one delivering and drives like crazy.  This part gives you a good picture of what Los Angeles and its cars looked like in 1941.  This was apparently Fields' last movie.",1426982400,,5453,4.644723092998955

2703726,5,B000LC4C0Q,"William Claude Fields was one of a kind, a comedian who was a lovable scoundrel in a long-forgotten era of non-scatological and non-sexual comedy that everyone (excluding contemporary politically correct morons) can enjoy.  The occasional politically incorrect comment is even funnier now when certain phrases and words are forbidden by the PC guardians of speech codes.  No one has or will ever be able to imitate Fields' type of comedy.  He had a tough early life and left home at age 11 because of a brutal father, and he grew up in the school of hard knocks.  That only encouraged his career of juggling and entertaining the crowds.  His well-known alcoholism was often a source of comedy too, e.g., ""I once loved a woman who drove me to drink... that's the one thing I'm indebted to her for.""  Another comment, ""... drowned in a vat of whiskey?  Death where is thy sting?""

His attempts at the golf course, croquet lawn, and the pool table reveal another major source of laughter as he tries ineffectually to show his ""expertise"" at games for which he has no skill.  His dislike of children is another peculiar characteristic and a sympathetic one because all his interactions are with little monsters or toddlers who throw oatmeal in his face and dip his pocket watch in a jar of molasses.

In this collection of five films there is no bad one.  All are worth having for many reasons -- a time long gone and distant memories, a time for laughter at many of our own foibles and mistakes, and a comedian whose larcenous behavior is actually funny.  His many names for his role and that of other characters are also humorous -- Larson E. Whipsnade (say it fast and it sounds like Larsony Whipsnake; Egbert Souse' (can be pronounced ""souse"" if you ignore the French accent mark) and many more.

In Poppy he sells a ""talking dog"" to the bartender, but it is Fields' ventriloquism that makes the dog seem to talk.  Before he walks off with $20 from the bartender, he has the dog say, ""I don't think I'll ever talk again because he left me here.""  Of course he never will talk again.

There are many such scenes in these movies and you will find them all enjoyable and unlike anything you have seen before if you are new to Mr. Fields.",1357689600,,2234,4.575376884422111

2703780,4,B000LC4C0Q,"WC Fields Comedy Collection Vol#2,features five more Fields entries;the majority from Paramount,and the last being from Universal. They are not Fields best films by any means,but they are still a nice collection to have,especially for all Fields fans out there.
First is You're Telling Me(released April/34)finds Fields as an optometrist and inventor by the name of Sam Bisbee. He invents a puncture proof tire,but when he gets an audience with some tire execs,he picks the wrong car to demonstrate on,flattens all its tires,and being a cop car,is forced to flee. On the way home by train he is contemplating suicide by Iodine but decides against it. He mistakenly goes into what he thinks is the bathroom but is the room of a countess. He spies an iodine bottle on her table and says don`t do it,and explains what he almost did. She instantly likes him,talks him up and they part. Next day she comes to town and the previously put down Fields is now on top of the world,thanks to the countess. Also the tire company apparently found the right car tires and has bought his invention. The countess and Fields part,with Fields still oblivious to the fact that she is a real countess. This is about the best of the bunch in this collection. The plot does meander but it shows off Fields famous golf routine and has some heart in it,especially in his attempted suicide and his preventing of the countess` suicide(the iodine for her was there because she cut her finger).Watch for a younger Buster Crabbe as Fields daughters suitor;soon to become famous as Flash Gordon. Tammany Young,as his caddy,was oft used by Fields in alot of his pictures,setting up Fields`vast array of gags. 3 1/2-4 stars.
The Old Fashioned Way(released July/34)finds Fields as the Great McGonigle,the head of a third rate performing troupe. He has a daughter in the show and she has a suitor who wants to perform with her,and refuses to go back to college. McGonigle discovers a wealthy woman in town and uses her to bankroll the show but he never uses her in the show at all. In the end the show is cancelled and Fields tells his daughter he is leaving for a big offer in New York city. His daughter and her suitor marry. The last scene shows Fields selling a household remedy.
This is quite the uneven movie and if it wasn`t for Field`s turn at juggling,and impressive it was at that,this movie would be a total failure. This movie,like so many of the others in this collection,has a quick,we-have-run-out of-time,ending to it. The film doesn`t tie all of its loose ends up,and the middle of the film showing Fields troupe performing its Drunkard sketch is just a 20 minute time waster,and not a plot advancer. 2 1/2-3 stars.
Man on the flying Trapeze(released Aug/35)finds Fields as Ambrose Wolfinger,who works in a company as its memory expert. He is a fountain of information on all the companies clients. His filing system is a shambles,but Fields knows his stuff. One day Fields tells his boss his mother in law has died and wants the afternoon off to attended her funeral. Off he goes,but it`s to the wrestling matches instead. He comes home to an explosive wife and no job as a result of his deception. In the end he gets his job back and his family reconcile. This films ending is another one of those that you scratch your head at. It shows the family driving out for a picnic,with the mother in law and her son in the rumble seat,as it starts to rain. Another we-ran-out-of-film,quick-lets-tag-on-something,anything. This is a mixed bag also,but it does have some funny moments ,ike the opening drunks singing in the cellar. Watch for a young Walter Brennan as one the drunks,and Grady Sutton of Taxi Boys fame(at Roach studios) as his mother in laws son. As you can see the title had nothing to do with the circus. 3-3 1/2 stars.
Popppy(released June/36)has Fields as Prof. McGargle who is a sideshow medicine salesman. He and his daughter lead a rough and tumble existence and one day they venture into a town. One of the rich boys falls in love with Poppy. There has been a big estate sitting fallow in town,run,in absence of a real family member,by a countess. Fields writes up a false marriage certificate which states he had married one of the last daughters of the estate name,and that his Poppy is rightful heir to the estate. Eventually the scheme falls through,but a sister to Fields imaginary wife,is still alive and a locket around Poppy`s neck contains proof Poppy is actually the real heir to the estate. This film is really an uneven mish mash and one of the poorest in the set. Its plot is as old as movies themselves and there is little excuse for Fields to do much of anything funny of import. 2 1/2 stars.
Finally,Never give a Sucker an Even Break(released Oct/41)has Fields as The Great Man. He is on his way to a film studio to hand in a script he thinks is a dandy. Much of the rest of the movie,off and on,is taken up with a filmic portrayal of the less than stellar script he hands in. He is fired and his daughter,an aspiring singer,quits as well. Fields takes her to a dress shop and while she is in there a middle aged woman asks for help getting to the maternity hospital. Fields drives her there for the last 10-15 minutes of filming.
This was Fields last starring film,and a rather rotund Fields now was past 60 years old,and about 5-6 years shy of passing on. This film has a good back up in the form of a Fields friend and vaudeville performer in Leon Errol,Margaret Dumont,a Marx brother stand out,is there,young Gloria Jean,Universals newest Deann Durbin imitator,but talented,and Franklin Pangborn. Pangborn,Jean and Fields all used their real names. There is a nice moment when Fields looks into the camera in a soda shop and says:``This was supposed to be a saloon, but the censor cut it out!"".And Gloria Jean also gets a into-the-camera look at the end when she says:""My Uncle Bill... but I still love him!"".The unreal script fields submits to the studio takes up a good deal of the time in this film and is really unfunny,to me. The film was directed by former Keaton collaborator Eddie Cline,whose Keystone roots really come to the fore in the maternity hospital race. 2 1/2 -3 stars.
Technically speaking the films are clear and crisp and look excellent considering their age. I`m glad they put each film on separate discs as it lowers the compression rate. There is a very nice documentary here,about 55 minutes long ,on WC Fields and hosted by the legendary Canadian comic duo of Johnny Wayne and Frank Shuster.
All in all this second collection should please all WC Fields fans out there. These films are not the best of his works by any means,but there are alot of Fields moments in here worth seeing. Recommended.",1349308800,,6742,4.685497470489039

2703782,5,B000LC4C0Q,"I was thinking of getting either Buster Keaton or WC Fields and decided on the latter, The Comedy Collection Volume One and Volume Two. Enjoyed both especially, ""Its a Gift"", ""The Bank Dick"", ""Never Give a Sucker an Even Break"" and ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze"". The movie My Little Chickadee is ok but I'm not a big fan of May West. A couple of the movies are a little too musical for me but its easy to hit the fast forward and skip through songs. Noticed that many of the same ""players"" are in a lot of his movies, sometimes playing the same role and sometimes cast as different characters. As slow witted as his characters seem to be, there is one movie in which he demonstrates his ability to juggle and I realized how well he played the part of someone who always seem to be confused about and bumbling through life. Some of the names of the players are a hoot such as Filthy McNasty. Enjoyed the settings of the 1930s and early 40s, seeing how people lived during those years, clothes, cars, the cost of food, the morals concerning liquor, smoking and relationships, adult humor then comparing same against todays standards. Each Volume includes a special feature describing his life. I liked the one in Volume One the best as it delved into his childhood and how his childhood affected his acting career. He had an affair with a younger quite attractive woman in later life despite being married and in the Volume One feature, it mentioned that she had been given roles in several of his movies. It was not until I played the movies again that I began looking for her name in the list of ""players"" and saw she was a secretary in at least two movies. Collectively, really enjoyed the two Volumes.",1338681600,,1705,4.485530546623794
2703783,5,B000LC4C0Q,"With almost six hours of the comedy genius of W.C. Fields, this 2nd volume was a must have for me! Here we got five of his classics - ""You're Telling Me"" 1934, ""The Old Fashioned Way"" 1934, ""Man on the Flying Trapeze"" 1935, ""Poppy"" 1936, and in his last film appearance ""Never Give a Sucker an Even Break"" 1941. Many if not all of his regular players were on board too. My favorites among these were ""You're Telling Me"", the hilarious ""The Old Fashioned Way"" with the classic scene with 'Baby LeRoy' (Albert Pepperday), and ""Man on the Flying Trapeze"". I never tire of watching the great W.C. Fields, in a way these films offer a glimpse into an long forgotten era! 'Universal' did an amazing job on the restoration and transfer of these films, the pictures are now in a pristine state. The beautiful case they come in is also noteworthy (reminds me of the great Time/Life collection of classical music!).

2703785,3,B000LC4C0Q,"W.C. Fields was an American original performer in many fields including juggling, comedy, acting, and writing. This second volume of his film collection is all black and white and treasures to be behold.

If love him, you'll love this collection of his five latter films with ""Never Give A Sucker An Even Break"" as his last film appearance and a Canadian documentary honoring his contributions to the entertainment industry. Although they could have gotten another documentary since the two hosts display his comic genius, timing, and his ability to manipulate the audience. The documentary does help us understand what made him different from other comics of his time like Sir Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, or Harold Lloyd. Fields never played sympathetic characters--he was playing con men and crooks but he did it genius and a smile. You liked him anyway.

In some of these films, he played the father figure since he wasn't young at the time. I loved him in ""You're Telling Me!"" with Adrienne Ames and a young Buster Crabbe playing his future son-in-law. ""The Old Fashioned Way"" was fine about a man running a touring show with his daughter. ""Poppy"" was about his daughter falling in love with a suitable gentleman in town.

Of course, the last ""Never Give A Sucker An Even Break!"" is his last hurrah but worth it to watch the car chase that begins innocently enough around Los Angeles over 7 decades ago. W.C. Fields made millions of Depression era Americans and the world laugh at himself and others. In the documentary, W.C. Fields's favorite co-star and collaborator was the incredible Mae West and a scene from ""My Little Chickadee"" is worth watching.

Unfortunately, I don't understand why they needed 5 DVDs for five films and a documentary. They could have used only 3 DVDs with both sides for all of them. Second complaint is that the film, ""The Man On the Flying Trapeze,"" didn't work on my DVD player. That's why I deducted a star for it's 5 DVDs which I felt was an evironmental waste and the one DVD that didn't work at all.",1325462400,,2043,4.779036827195467

2703788,5,B000LC4C0Q,"By now, I will assume if you are reading this, you know about W.C. Fields and his comedy.  These five films are very representative of his style and unique character.  Two films, ""The Old Fashioned Way"" and ""Poppy"" are his carnival/side show/con man character with many quotable one liners, with ""..Way"" being the better of the two.  ""You're Telling Me"" and ""Man on a Flying Trapeze"" are his misunderstood family man w/daughter.  Both are very funny with Fields in fine ""drunkard"" form, and with ""It's A Gift"" from volume 1 make the hat trick of domestic comedy/frustration scenarios and provide many of his most quoted sayings.  These two films made the purchase of this collection worth it.  Even on multiple viewing, I still won't contain my laughter.  The last film ""Never Give A Sucker An Even Break"" was his last feature, and is truly a surreal adventure in film making.  He had complete control of this film, and I can only wish that he would have maintained health to have created a few more of this type of comic nonsense.  To be honest, it was the price that brought me to purchase this collection.  I always wanted these films, but couldn't bring myself to afford them.  At under $15, I couldn't afford not too.

""Poppy"" (1936) is the weakest of the bunch due to Fields' relatively limited screen time, but all remain hilarious showcases for The Great Man's iconoclastic brilliance.

That said, his brand of humor holds up amazingly well more than 70 years after some of these were first released.

Sound and picture quality are first-rate.  ""You're Telling Me"" is a rare gem--a film I had never seen before--and very funny.  (The one time it was supposed to be on television, my local station showed the 1942 Hugh Herbert movie instead.  Arrgh!)  ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze"" and ""The Old Fashioned Way"" are mid-1930s classics.  Fields is at the top of his form in both films.  You will find yourself humming ""The Banks of the Wabash"" and that shell-gathering song by Jan Duggan for weeks afterward.  ""Poppy"" is the sound version of Fields' starring stage play.  He was very sick during the filming, but it's still an amusing film.  ""Never Give a Sucker..."" is a plotless mess with flashes of his usual brilliance.

2703932,5,B000LC4C0Q,"""A thing worth having, is a thing worth cheating for."" - W.C. Fields

That may be true, Great Man, yet I am sorry to admit that I could never try to cheat this set to me. Having done such an exquisite job restoring the rest of the very best of one of the most side-splitting and original funny-men to ever enter the screen, Universal deserves all the credit they can get. Not quite as much credit as the man who made it all possible in the first place, though: W.C. Fields!

The debate as to which film is the best in this set seems to vary to such a tremendous degree that I'll not bother telling you which one to watch first. MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE, YOU'RE TELLING ME!, THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY--if you appreciate Fields at all, you can't go wrong with any of these; if you've never seen his work, these films should serve as an excellent introduction. NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK is also terrific, in my opinion, despite what some might say. The only bit of a letdown to me was POPPY, which focused too much on the difficult love affair between a boy and the daughter of the Great Man, than the Great Man himself (he's as hilarious as always, no worries; I just wish he could be seen more in it). There's a little documentary from the mid-1960's as a bonus on one of the discs, covering his life and (mostly) career through clips from his films. Sadly, the documentary has not aged one tenth as well as the films it presents, but is nevertheless charming to the fan. Just don't try to introduce the unfamiliar with it.

Fields' humor does not seem to appeal to everyone. One could say he inhabits a rather misanthropic view on the world, and is not instantly lovable in the manner of, say, Laurel & Hardy (whom I also adore). It took me a few films to truly understand him, but once I did, there was no way around; he now easily ranks among my favorite comedians. Even in his lesser films, Fields always manages to throw in some memorable lines and ad-libs; and his very best films, some of which are included in this set, easily rank among the funniest ever made.

Fields best work is a companion to Volume One which included the Comedy Classics ""It's a Gift"" and ""The Bank Dick"", Field's two best films in my opinion.  While this volume does not have a close rival to those two films, the films included here nonetheless have quite a bit to offer any Fields Fan.

""You're Telling Me"" features the hilarious extended Golfing Scene with Field's very suspect caddy...

""The Old Fashioned Way"" included Fields at his best when it comes to dealing with little obnoxioius children (in this one, Field literally gives ""the boot"" to arch nemesis Baby LeRoy...

""Man on the Flying Trapeze"" (which has nothing to do with a man on a flying Trapeze) features a memorable cast of family characters who Fields ultimately triumphs over...  This film is often overlooked in the Fields Pantheon but I think it's a gem!

""Poppy"" features the essential Fields personality, the con man who gets by on his personality flaws to make a living...

""Never Give a Sucker an Even Break"" is perhaps most interesting in this collection as it is Fields Last Major Starring Film (1941) playing more or less himself but in fantasy sequences often laced with his special brand of boozing humour.  Such lines as ""I was in love with a beautiful blond once.  She drove me to drink and that is the one thing I am indebted to her for!"" This movie also contains Franklin Pangborn, who played the memorable Bank Examiner J. Pinkerton Snoopington in ""The Bank Dick"" the year before this film was made.

""Poppy"" is less pure Fields but it still an entertaining film that shows that W.C. could do it all. All four of these films are loaded with GREAT characters actors ... check out Kathleen Howard, for instance. What a delight she was! Technically, these 65 to 75 year old films have been restored to absolute brilliance. This is a MUST own W.C. Fields collection.",1198281600,,945,4.564705882352941
2703991,5,B000LC4C0Q,"Ah yes.

My friends, It behooves me in the auspices of this regarded medium, to present for your consideration and edification, this treasured assemblage of veritable comedic virtuosity. The Great Man's unprecedented mythological persona and peerless powers of euphonious linguistics, flawless timing, sociological impossibilities, and acts of astonishing physical coordination, are magnificently ensconced in this sophomore offering of cinematic masterpieces.

Here we see the Great man's true essence in all its complexity and grandeur. What a cornucopia of idiosyncratic responses to the harsh realities of American life and the unfathomable moral paradoxes that inevitably arise. Witness, by way of example, ""The Old Fashioned Way"" wherein Mr. Fields, in the guise of the Great McGonigle, blusters his way through the plot with his usual braggadocio of larcenous chicanery. And in the end, in an incongruous act of unheralded clemency sacrifices his own contentment and felicity to insure the beatitude and plenteous prosperity of his daughter.

This is but a single citation from the convocation at hand, congregated and arrayed with all the gaudy trappings of pageantry.

Service and delivery was also excellent.",1188518400,,134,6.105263157894737
2703999,5,B000LC4C0Q,"Let me begin by saying this: Thank God for DVD! It has given us fans the opportunity to see (and own) these great films (some for the very first time), instead of allowing them to languish forever in some musty vault.
After viewing & enjoying Volume 1, I didn't think it was possible to top that initial collection; I'm happy to say, I was wrong. Volume 2 unearths such rarely-seen gems as ""You're Telling Me"", ""Poppy"", ""The Old-Fashioned Way"", ""Man On The Flying Trapeze"" and of course, Fields' starring swan song, ""Never Give A Sucker An Even Break"".
Do I have a favorite among this collection? It's tough choosing one, considering I really like all of them, so I won't. ""You're Telling Me"" starts off hilariously with Fields drunkenly stumbling through his front door--and having the nerve to try to hide his inebriation from his shrewish, disapproving wife. An ambitious inventor, he tries to get patented by demonstrating his ""puncture-proof"" car tires by shooting out his own tires--but accidentally shoots out a police car's tires instead. The movie climaxes with a classic old Fields bit, the ""golf routine"".
""The Old-Fashioned Way"" is a grand 1800's-style vehicle which puts Fields in his element as the leader of a theatrical troupe, always one step ahead of the law & one step behind in financial obligations. The film is packed with great comedy moments: Another hilarious encounter with Fields' child nemesis, Baby LeRoy; Fields listening to an audition by the shrill song stylings of a stage-struck rich dowager (Fields only wants her around to plunder her bankroll); and the play itself, ""The Drunkard"", with performances so hokey & over the top that it's hysterical to watch.
""Man On The Flying Trapeze"" relies more on situational comedy than broad slapstick. But the story is a beauty: Fields, after 25 years of service, asks his boss for the afternoon off; however, he makes the mistake of saying he's attending his mother-in-law's funeral, when actually, he's sneaking off to see a wrestling exhibition. The ""little lie"" snowballs into a preposterous disaster as Fields loses his job, finally tells off his irritating in-laws & defends his devoted daughter (Fields tended to portray families as mean & nasty in his films, a reflection of an unhappy childhood at the hands of an abusive father). To our surprise, the situation rights itself: Fields gets re-hired (with better pay & benefits), and he puts his shrewish wife & clinging in-laws in their place. The intricate workings of the story are simply amazing.
""Poppy"" is the film adaptation of a Fields stage play. Balancing a dramatic storyline (the title character, Fields' daughter, seeking a better life, love & acceptance into society) with a more comical one (Fields as her finagling medicine-show father), it's another classic Fields vehicle.
Fields reached his zany zenith with the dizzy ""Never Give A Sucker An Even Break"", a mis-shapen comedy confection where Fields tries to sell the most ridiculous, preposterous movie script to a movie studio head (played with wonderful exasperation by Franklin Pangborn). As the script story unfolds, logic is completely thrown out the window. We don't believe it, the studio chief doesn't believe it. But who cares? This, after all, is a comedy to enjoy, and we delight in Fields introducing such crazy things as gorillas, planes with an open observation deck, reclusive & wealthy women (played here by the Marx Brothers' favorite dowager, Margaret Dumont), and silly kissing games.
Even middle-aged, Fields' hands are as nimble & quick as ever. Just watch him do his juggling routine at the end of ""The Old-Fashioned Way"" or use various props to accentuate the laughs in any of these films. His physical bits are simply astounding to watch.
Another interesting thing about Fields is his screen character: He might be dishonest & loutish at times, but no matter what happens, we are with him all the way, proving that underdogs can come out on top.
The DVD extras include a 60's documentary about Fields, hosted by Wayne & Shuster (?).
If Universal is smart, they will release a Volume 3 to round things out. After all, we still need to see other gems such as ""Six Of A Kind"", ""Mississippi"", ""Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch"", ""If I Had A Million"" and ""David Copperfield"".",1187913600,3,4293,4.9805013927576605

2704054,4,B000LC4C0Q,"With this second collection of films starring W C Fields, Universal now have 2 sets which cover all of his best work.  Field's films tend to fall into 2 categories - those when he is a hen-pecked husband and those when he is a performer. I prefer the former because he is much more sympathetic when he is put upon. It is worth noting that most of Field's films were programmers which supported the main feature; hence the modest production values and short running times.  This collection contains 4 films from the Paramount days and one from Universal. Amazon and others have described the films perfectly but here a few observations.

- ""You're Telling me"" is a precursor to ""It's a Gift"" and ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze"" because Fields is henpecked. The film is surprising, offering Fields some unusually serious scenes with the stunning Adrienne Ames as a princess whom he meets on a train.  His golf routine is hilarious.
- ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze"" is a book end piece to ""It's a Gift"" and almost as good. Kathleen Howard is back as his shrewish wife and Mary Brian is his charming daughter. The film has no plot to speak of and a very short running time. Fields singing in the cellar with the burglars is hilarious.
- In ""the Old Fashioned Game"", Fields is the Great McGonigle who runs an acting troupe and keeps one step ahead of the sheriff. The film is well mounted and contains famous scenes with Baby Leroy and Fields's juggling act.
- ""Poppy"" is a weak Victorian melodrama and Fields, while top billed, supports the charming Rochelle Hudson as his adopted daughter who is an orphan heiress. The best moment is near the start when Fields sells a talking dog.  Also, there are some charming opening credits with the title song sung in close harmony.  Fields was seriously ill by this stage in his career and there is an obvious use of doubles.
- ""Never give a Sucker an even Break"" is a Universal production, the last film in which he starred.  The photography is clearer and brighter than the Paramount films. The film is screwy in the manner of a Marx Brothers comedy with no real plot but it is worth waiting for the superb car chase which ends the film. The disc also contains a rare TV special on Fields hosted by the comedians Wayne and Schuster. The documentary is modest by today's standards and the hosts are genial at best. The best thing is it contains most of Fields and Alison Skipworth's episode of ""If I had a Million"", an hilarious piece whereby they reek revenge on road hogs.

The prints are superb, by far the best I have seen. The set is good value.",1182297600,3,2589,4.517094017094017

But I would like all the so-called Fields fans to knock it off about ""My Little Chickadee"" and ""You Can't Cheat an Honest Man."" I recently re-watched the former on the Mae West box (from Amazon), a cheap little Universal knockoff, and it was plenty entertaining, particularly mae west blowing away Indians from a moving train with all the nonchalance of a woman waiting in a bank line. ""You Can't Cheat an Honest Man"" has fine Fields bits, like when he showers with the trunk of an elephant (""Give, Queenie. Give, queen!""). It's not the cream of the best, but both have their moments. As for Vol. 2 here, people laud ""Never Give A Sucker An Even Break,"" but I think that one's kind of sluggish. It is wonderfully absurd at times, but except for ""Squeegelum"" there's not a lot going for it. It's certainly not ""The Bank Dick."" See, I can nitpick, too...but the point is we've got what we've been asking for. Let's just enjoy it.",1182297600,,1075,4.517948717948718

2704125,5,B000LC4C0Q,"W.C. FIELDS COMEDY COLLECTION: VOLUME 2 is a DVD boxed set that should be an ideal introduction to younger audiences who do not know his work, and should delight his millions of avid fans around the world.  An hour-length Canadian TV documentary exploring with generous clips why he is so funny and immortal is a most welcome bonus.  It is ""hiding"" on disk five, not disk one.  Five movies are on five disks on open-up cards in unusually high class packaging for Universal Home Video.

I love all five of these W.C.Fields movies, starting with YOU'RE TELLING ME! (1934).  Henpecked husband and inventor Sam Bisbee has bad luck with inventions like a puncture-proof tire.  On a train out of town, he is saved from suicide by a princess (Adrienne Ames in a lovely performance) who wants to be an ordinary person.  So she inroduces herself to Sam as ""Marie"" and becomes his friend.  Watch the reaction when Marie wants to meet Sam's family and town who hate him.  And watch a hysterically funny golf game; it takes ten minutes with fussing around and a pesky caddy (Tammany Young) to leave the first hole.  This is a 67 minute masterpiece.

THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY (1934) has Fields as The Great McGonigle, leader of a vaudeville troupe back in 1880's small town America.  Much of the action takes place in a boarding house with unpaid bills (and includes memorable work by Baby LeRoy), and The Great McGonigle gets to swindle a lot of unsuspecting people at a carnival setting.  Great fun.

These are short films, about 70 minutes each; I was double-billing them.  MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE(1935) is a 65 minute comedy masterpiece with Fields as henpecked (as always) Ambrose Wolfinger, a hardworking businessman.  Poor W.C. lies about the death of a loathsome mother-in-law so that he can have a rare afternoon off to go to a big wrestling match.  Before the day is over, he may wish said mother-in-law really WAS dead when the house is filled with condolence flowers.  This is the movie where Ambrose manages to get FOUR traffic tickets simultaneously; you have to see it to believe it.

POPPY (1936) is a sweet and funny sound remake of a W.C. Fields silent gem called SALLY OF THE SAWDUST (1925).  I like POPPY a bit more because Fields' Professor Eustace McGargle is nicer, and Rochelle Hudson is wonderful in a starring role as his daughter Poppy.  McGargle is an epic con man and master card shark who wants to have Poppy marry a millionaire and be happy.  There is a skillful dose of poignancy mixed in with humor here.  It is a lovely and funny movie.

Finally, we have the incomparable NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK (1941), with Fields playing himself and pretty ingenue actress Gloria Jean as herself and his niece.  Fields has a looney screenplay he wants Franklin Pangborn (also playing himself) of Esoteric Studios to buy.  As Pangborn reads the script in his office with Fields, we see the deranged comedy script dramatized--on an airplane with Gloria Jean, Fields jumps out a window to retrieve a whiskey bottle.  He lands at a mountaintop estate of Margaret Dumont, a virgin daughter who wants to play ""post office"", and a pet gorilla.  One look at Dumont sends Fields diving off a terrace and descending 2,000 feet in a basket.  But Leon Errol, a Russian addicted to goat's milk, has stories of Dumont being a millionairess.  So, to make Gloria Jean happy and wealthy, Fields decides to woo Dumont.  The climax is one of the American sound cinema's greatest car chases.  This surrealistic comedy is a neglected masterpiece that has improved with age.

If you love W.C. Fields, this second boxed set is better than the first, with true Fields movies and really good ones in crystal-clear knockout studio prints.  If you are not familiar with his anti-social and henpecked con man persona, W.C. FIELDS COMEDY COLLECTION: VOLUME TWO is one you should add to your collection to get acquainted with the comedy master.  Now if only we can have a Volume Three with some Fields silent films and the incomparable TILLIE AND GUS (1933).  And more bonus material.",1176422400,9,4070,4.747863247863248
2704126,5,B000LC4C0Q,"As a Volume 2, this box set is as good as it gets and comliments Volume 1 quite nicely.  The ""Man on the Flying Trapeze"" is a true comedy classic and the second best Fields movie ever (after ""It's a Gift"" on Vol. 1).  ""The Old Fashioned Way"" is great because of Fields' interplay with Baby LeRoy and it also has rare footage of Fields' vaudeville juggling act that is amazing to see even in this day and age.

2704131,4,B000LC4C0Q,"I am delighted that Universal has begun to get off its big, lazy corporate tush and FINALLY release some of the vintage Paramount features they've held hostage for so long.

Though all of the five Fields features showcased in this set are good 'uns, ""The Old Fashioned Way,"" from 1934, is a godsend. Not only is this Fields' most heartfelt filmic effort, but this film has NEVER been commercially available on home video until now.

The print is in fine shape, complete with the original NRA logo preceding the Paramount logo. What a joy this film is! This is Fields at his most accessible AND most challenging. He draws out certain scenes to the point that they're guaranteed to tax someone's patience. But a certain brilliance occurs, as in the films of Jacques Tati, as a result of this protraction. Brilliant comic set-pieces permeate this film.

The finale contains an extended demonstration of Fields' juggling and sleight-of-hand. It is spellbinding. I'm amazed at how Fields works humor into these feats of co-ordination and eye/hand contact.

And then there's the extremely melancholy ending...I don't wish to spoil it for anyone who's not seen this remarkable movie.

It's nice to have the also-unreleased-on-video ""Man On The Flying Trapeze"" on DVD, plus the digital debuts of ""Poppy,"" the terrific ""You're Telling Me!"" and Fields' swansong, the baroquely absurd ""Never Give A Sucker An Even Break.""

My only complaint: this should have been a two-disc set. These are short films. Three of them could have fit on one DVD, and two, plus the ""vintage documentary,"" which I've not yet seen, could cozily sit on the other. It's wasteful to put a 70 minute film all by itself on a DVD.

This complaint goes for the prior volume. I think more people would buy these sets if they were less expensive. A $29.99 two-disc set would sell more copies than this overpriced, excessively-packaged five discer.

But the quality of the films can't be questioned. Aside from ""It's A Gift"" and ""The Bank Dick,"" the first set is dross. The five films on this second set all have great merits. I can't stand ""You Can't Cheat An Honest Man"" and ""My Little Chickadee,"" which pollute the first set. They are highly compromised by co-stars who antagonize Fields without complementing his comic wit. I find both films depressing, and a waste of Fields' gifts as a comedian and actor.

""International House,"" while a delightful '30s free-for-all, is not a Fields vehicle, per se. He's just one of an array of Paramount stars and vaudeville troupers who tromp through its paper-thin, absurd ""plot.""

This second volume, then, is an improvement over the first. I hope people won't be put off by the unnecessarily high price, and wasteful packaging. They will miss out on some of the most sublime moments of comedy in American films. W. C. Fields' humor is not for everyone.

8161214,5,B000LC4C0Q,"This box set of 5 W.C. Fields classics is, at the moment, a fabulous buy for holiday gifting. The content, film by film, deserves an ""A"" (volume 1 perhaps deserves A plus).  The box is sturdy board.  A new set features all ten films plus eight more for $75; if you have none of Fields' work, that is not unreasonable. However for those who need a less complete set, then $14.95 (I paid $59.95 when it came out in 2007) is a no brainer. You'll receive an elegant package of hilarious, and important, work by an American original.",1447372800,,528,4.377551020408164
