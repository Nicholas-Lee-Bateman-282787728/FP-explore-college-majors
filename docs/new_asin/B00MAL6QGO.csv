8671137,2,B00MAL6QGO,"I received this as a Christmas gift and I was so excited to start watching this. I had this on my wish list and I had done so much research and I thought I had found the American version of this wonderful tv series. I have nothing against the original Japanese version, I've even read the manga, but I saw the American version first and immediately fell in love. It's so hard to find episodes, let alone a complete series, of the American version since it was cancelled in Japan and decided to be taken off the market because of some questionable scenes. Because of that the American version was pulled too. I thought this was finally my break and the American cardcaptors was being rereleased, but I found out the hard way that the English was just dubbed over the original Japanese show. I was so disheartened and can't believe that I now have 23 episodes of pretty much useless content, and I don't have the heart to tell my parents who gifted this too me that they wasted their money. If you are a fan of the original Japanese anime and don't feel like reading subtitles then I recommend this product.",1482710400,2,1105,4.448275862068965
8671138,4,B00MAL6QGO,So I prefer to watch any anime dubbed never subed because I can't stand how overly exaggerated japanese voice acting is but sadly none of the original series voice actors come back to do their past roles in this re release and it's a shame but we can't always have everything and should be grateful for what we get regardless,1482710400,2,325,4.433333333333334
8671139,4,B00MAL6QGO,"I just received Volumes 1, 2, & 3 in the mail today. The DVD's arrived in perfect quality and I could not wait until I popped the DVD into my laptop. Upon seeing that it had the English dub, I decided to watch it in that format, hoping to hear the voices I heard and loved as a geeky child. And oh boy, were my hopes and dreams crushed into pieces. The English dub is flat out horrible. Sakura's voice is way too high and pitchy, actually many of the female characters are, Cerberus' voice is also high & pitchy. Toya and their father's voice are just bland, monotone, and boring. This actually seems to be the theme for many of the male characters on the show. It was really disappointing to hear, because despite Nelvana heavily editing the show when it aired in North America, I feel that the voice actors they got were better suited for the characters.

With that being said, the quality of the show is fantastic; the colours, sound, picture quality. And it's great that you're getting all 70 episodes when you order volumes 1, 2, & 3. They're unedited, so you're seeing the show as it aired in Japan. So for die-hard fans of the show, you'll be happy with the DVD, and like me, you'll have to watch the show in Japanese with English subtitles.",1480118400,5,1248,4.379310344827586

8671141,4,B00MAL6QGO,"This is a bittersweet boon for many fans of this legendary series. On the one hand, we finally have an official release of the full, uncut Cardcaptor Sakura that's NOT a mediocre bootleg. On the other hand, any fans who have seen the mangled English dub will find this cast extremely lacking.  The representation, cells, colors and audio are all perfect and luckily these DVD sets DO contain the original Japanese sound track.  That said, the voice acting for the English dub is subpar to say the least. Very amateurish (inflections and emphases added at strange times that barely matches the characters' reactions), no big name seiyuus to carry the production, and there are several major pronunciations that differ from the previous English dub (MadHouse's ""Card Captors"") that will be off-putting to any fans who first learned of/sampled the series through that production.  ""Clow"" is pronounced ""Cloh"", as opposed to the """" (ah) sound used in it. Sakura is pronounced ""Suh-KOOra"" as opposed to the proper ""SAH-kra"" and Kerberos is pronounced ""Ker-BEAR-os."", which is actually much closer to the actual name (A Japanese play on words of the Greek ""Cerberus"") than ""Keroberos"" was in the other dub.  As for the voices, while most of them do match the characters well enough, they just leave something to be desired. Kero, in particular, is high and whiny especially compared to the deep, self-assured voice he had in the previous dub.  Sakura just sounds like your average young girl and her brother and love interest are just as generic.

Here's the thing though: while the voice acting was much better in MadHouse's ""Cardcaptors"", the footage was cut, mangled and re-arranged to make the whole series more American/child friendly. This is a very polarizing issue for fans--you either love it or you despise it for what it did to CardCaptor Sakura. For those of the former, this production is a hard pill to swallow. For the latter and those who've never seen Cardcaptors, it's a fairly decent addition to your ""Magical Girl"" collection that does the original justice--other than certain aspects of the voice acting for the English Dub.",1453593600,5,2139,5.011267605633803
8671142,2,B00MAL6QGO,"I am not going to comment on the other two volumes because they have the same problem.  I ordered these before and thought it was the old nelvana.  how stupid was I.  anyway, each disk container holds 4 disks yet it only has one hole to put all four disks on.  that is not a good idea.  I had another dvd series like that.  there were 3 disks, yet they were on top of each other.  every time I brought one disk out, I had to take all disks out and a few scratches got on them on the first few days I had them.  long story short, the disks in the future got thrown away due to too macy scratches and skips.  to save people time and money, always have one disk being held by one lock even if you need more that one disk sleeve in the case and make it look thicer.",1431993600,2,761,3.858064516129032
8671143,5,B00MAL6QGO,"one of if the the greatest series ever made in now available in a complete format. this has been a labor of love in searching for. ive spent the last 8 years looking for this series, and now its here. the animation is crisp and clean. the sound is good. its still amazing that i have this series in my hands. an absolute must have for anime libraries.",1414108800,6,351,4.176470588235294

8671145,5,B00MAL6QGO,"...Of Clamp's one and only Cardcaptor Sakura! With the original Pioneer DVDs out of print and getting harder to find, the only alternative until now was various bootlegs of dubious quality. (I saw one that claimed to have all 70 episodes on 3 discs. Yikes!) But just this month, NIS America has finally come out with a licensed re-release of the entire series on Blu-Ray and DVD which includes not only the original Japanese voices, but an uncut English dub by Animax--still not very good, but at least not a hatchet job like Nelvana's 'Cardcaptors'.

Here I am reviewing Collection #1 of the Region 1 DVD release. It includes Episodes 1-23 on 4 single-sided discs in one case. They are stacked on top of each other on one spindle which is not my favorite form of packaging, so I've moved them to a better case of my own. The cover is so generic that it's easy to mistake this for just another bootleg, but rest assured it is the real thing. The quality is good with a picture ratio of 4:3 (pillarboxed 16:9) and Dolby digital sound. And of course, the show itself is still as delightful and charming as ever.

If you're looking for a REAL release of this show for the 21st century, this is it--and if you want it on Blu-Ray, that version is on Amazon as well. The only downside is the price. I can understand the whole Blu-ray set going for $200 and up, but $150+ for the DVD's (with no option to buy them all together and save) is rather steep. Still, NIS America is a small company and a licensed release of this series couldn't have been cheap. If you can afford it, skip the bootlegs and reward their efforts now!",1408147200,20,1618,4.426174496644295
