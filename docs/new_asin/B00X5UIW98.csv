7158830,1,B00X5UIW98,"I am getting tired of re-purchasing Charlie Brown DVD's just for one brand new episode that I havnt seen on DVD before. Why can't they just release box set's and call it good? The decade sets were fantastic, but they got cancelled. Charlie brown good grief! Your not going to survive in this current generation by just releasing your episodes on DVD! Release in box sets on Blu-ray and then I will be happy! I have every DVD that I want from Charlie brown and can't see myself buying anything charlie brown except for collectibles. Sorry Charlie brown. RIP",1443398400,7,556,4.626262626262626
7158831,5,B00X5UIW98,"This is the collection I've been waiting for. holiday collection aside this has all my childhood favorites. Some of the videos were new to me so that was a plus. and while the ones i love to watch are found on other dvds its nice to have them all together.
come on how can you not love
It's Magic, Charlie Brown
Life is a Circus, Charlie Brown
It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown
My kids have already watched both disks about a dozen times.",1442707200,3,436,4.329268292682927
7158832,3,B00X5UIW98,"This is a ripoff. I need to get this collection because What Have We Learned and Why Charlie Brown Why are not on DVD and I don't have those. The others have already been released and I already have them on the individual releases. I don't like that I have to pay more to get what I already have when I only need two shows. I wish Warner could have released those two specials by themselves so I wouldn't have to rebuy all these others I already have. Nevertheless, I'm sure I will enjoy old Charlie Brown and Snoopy as always. Just shame on Warner for ripping people off.",1433116800,7,572,4.256880733944954
7158833,4,B00X5UIW98,"You might want to call this ""The 1980's Collection, part 1"" as it features just about every half-hour 1980's special.
By the 1980's television was pushing more education on kids, and the Peanuts Specials had a message of inspiration to tell.
Yes, there was always a message starting with the very first Christmas special, but now that becomes the main focus.  Humor and entertainment seems to take a pack seat.  Now we get stories on how to deal with friends dying of cancer.

Also sourly gone is the classic Jazz music of the late Vince Guaraldi who sadly passed away before these were made.  Instead of re-editing his classic theme songs to these new specials, new easy listening music was now used.  It didn't feel the same.

So now we have a new type of Charlie Brown special, still worth a watch but not by any means a classic.",1432598400,9,832,4.550335570469799
7158834,5,B00X5UIW98,"I for one am glad to see this collection being released later this year. I have always been into Peanuts but when it comes to DVD's I prefer collections vs individual specials which is why I was very happy to see the decade sets being released. Prior to that I only had a set which included the Christmas, Halloween and Thanksgiving specials. I quickly jumped at the opportunity of getting complete sets and hoped for more. I was saddened when they stopped after the 70's.

At that point they went back to individuals but I refused to but then just in case. The only exception was the This Is America set. I'm glad I held out. This for me includes all brand new to DVD specials except for two which are in the decade sets but two out of eleven is nothing to contain about. Aside of the two from the 70's this set includes eight from the 80's and one from the 90's. I can only hope this encourages them to continue with these type of releases.",1432425600,3,942,4.292134831460674

7158836,5,B00X5UIW98,"This September, Warner will release Peanuts: The Emmy Honored Collection (no doubt to tie-in with the release of the upcoming Peanuts movie!). This release features 2 Emmy winning and 9 Emmy nominated Peanut specials (2 of which appear on DVD for the very first time, and 5 newly remastered!). Here's the following according to TVShowsonDVD.com:

-You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown (already on DVD, already remastered) (Nominated)
-She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown (already on DVD, already or newly remastered) (Nominated)
-It's Magic, Charlie Brown (already on DVD, already remastered) (Nominated)
-Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown (already on DVD, newly remastered!) (Nominated)
-Is this Goodbye, Charlie Brown? (already on DVD, newly remastered!) (Nominated)
-Life is a Circus, Charlie Brown (already on DVD, already remastered) (Winner)
-What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown? (First time on DVD!!!) (Nominated)
-It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown (already on DVD, newly remastered!) (Nominated)
-Snoopy's Getting Married, Charlie Brown (already on DVD, newly remastered!) (Nominated)
-Why, Charlie Brown, Why? (First time on DVD!!!) (Nominated)
-You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown (already on DVD, already remastered) (Winner)

I for one I'm really excited because as mentioned already, we're getting to new-to-DVD titles and 5 newly remastered and even though 4 are double dips, it's worth the purchase for the new material! Highly recommended!

One complaint though; no A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. Still, worth it.",1430784000,23,1565,5.737068965517241

7158859,5,B00X5UIW98,"Unlike the real decade sets of the Peanuts specials, the Emmy-Honored Collection contains 11 Peanuts specials on a 2-disc DVD set, all of which received Emmy nominations, all of them are non-holiday specials, and all of them are remastered in UHD (Ultra-High-Definition). Other non-holiday Peanuts specials received Emmy nominations but never made it here, nor the holiday specials themselves! Even so, this collection contains almost one-quarter of all the Peanuts specials ever made, and 8 of them are most of the half-hour Peanuts specials made in the 1980's, so you can call this volume 1 of the Peanuts 1980's Collection, if you want to, and add it to the decade sets if you have them! The WB left out a lot of Oscar-nominated toons for their Academy Awards Animation Collection DVDs from 2008, even though the nominees' discs were reissued by themselves in 2013 and 2014, so this isn't the only time the WB left out important stuff from such elite, prestigious, prodigious, collections! This set contains the 1983 special What Have We Learned Charlie Brown, which is a sequel to 1980's Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (And Don't Come Back!), which Paramount finally put on DVD just a few weeks after this set! This AND the 1990 special, Why, Charlie Brown, Why?, have never been on DVD until this set, but it also has 2 specials from the 1970's that have been remastered, even more so than in volume 2 of the 1970's Collection, and it has no bonus features at all, for reasons unknown, to me at least! Bon Voyage... ain't in this set, if you're wondering; in fact, Paramount put all 4 original Peanuts movies in 1 DVD set in 2016, at long last, albeit Faux-Widescreen compared to being seen on VHS many years ago! Add this elite collection of Emmy-worthy Peanuts specials, which is a new decade set in disguise, and then some, to your decade sets today!",1453248000,11,1853,4.775700934579439

7158864,5,B00X5UIW98,"Nice collection of Emmy nominated Peanuts TV specials!

The picture is great as is the sound. Nice variety of stories with all of them at least interesting. Of course since this is Charlie Brown and the gang the stories are fairly simple and straight forward. And the animation is fairly simple as well. The charm is in the interaction of the characters and how they handle things.

I would rate this a pretty good 8.75 to 9.25 out of 10 - recommended for Charlie Brown and the gangs fans or anyone looking to remember a part of their youth!",1448928000,,541,4.454545454545454

7158866,4,B00X5UIW98,"I, like many of you, were holding out on buying individual releases hoping they'd continue with the decades sets. I made a few exceptions (""Snoopys Reunion"", ""You're A Good Man"" and ""I Want a Dog for Christmas""), but besides those I mostly stuck to buying collections. I bought the 4- disc set that included 4 ""Happiness Is.. Peanuts"" releases which featured one TV special as well as an episode of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, so it's basically a collection as I got 4 specials, and I also consider ""This Is America, Charlie Brown"" as a collection. So I was thrilled when I saw this EMMY Honored Collection as it had 6 specials I did not own. 6 out of 11 is kind of bad, but considering the decade collections only had 6 specials each, and Warner Bros. continues to release them 2 per disc (one special plus another one as a ""bonus"") I decided to make the leap. Very glad I did, as well.",1446508800,,894,4.391566265060241
7158867,5,B00X5UIW98,"When I heard about this new set coming to stores 4 months ago, I was initially reluctant to buy it since, as others have mentioned, it's all double-dip and I already own all of the Peanuts specials on DVD. But when I saw that most of these were going to appear as new 4K remasters, I eventually changed my mind and figured I would upgrade. I bought this at Barnes and Noble last month when it came out and am glad I did. Although the 1980s specials and ""Why, Charlie Brown, Why?"" (1990) on this set have already been released on iTunes or some kind of standalone Charlie Brown compilation, this is the first time they've appeared restored as opposed to the other ""off-the-shelf"" prints that appeared on those earlier formats.

By my count, if Warner Home Video were to release the rest of the Charlie Brown specials by the decades (which they absolutely should), it would take two more sets for everything to be available on DVD:

1980s - DISC 1
A Charlie Brown Celebration
It's An Adventure, Charlie Brown!
You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown! (already remastered for its own Deluxe Edition DVD)

DISC 2
Happy New Year, Charlie Brown! (already remastered for I WANT A DOG FOR CHRISTMAS, CHARLIE BROWN)
Snoopy!!! The Musical
It's the Girl in the Red Truck, Charlie Brown

1990s/2000s - DISC 1
Why, Charlie Brown, Why? (already remastered for this set)
Snoopy's Reunion (already remastered for its own Deluxe Edition DVD)
It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown
It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown
It Was My Best Birthday Ever, Charlie Brown
It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown

DISC 2
A Charlie Brown Valentine
Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales
I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown (already remastered for its own Deluxe Edition DVD)
Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown
He's a Bully, Charlie Brown

The only special that probably won't be released would be ""You're in the Superbowl, Charlie Brown"". I've heard that WB doesn't own the release rights to this special because of the NFL logo and other trademark symbols appearing throughout the special.

I highly recommend this set, along with the 1960s and 1970s decade sets.",1443830400,2,2122,4.8292011019283745
8715079,5,B00X5UIW98,"This collection of Emmy-nominated specials from ""Peanuts"", were quite a joy to watch!
