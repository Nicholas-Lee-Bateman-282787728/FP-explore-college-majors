7234782,5,B00YS4V53A,"So great to be able to get all three movies in a boxed set! I love the Minions, and even though the Minion Movie did not get great reviews, I loved it! So happy to have this set, and to get it send so quickly!",1457740800,,209,3.6666666666666665
7234783,4,B00YS4V53A,Christmas gift for my four year old grand daughter... she loved it!,1456790400,,67,4.666666666666667
7234784,5,B00YS4V53A,"""Were sorry, but you have entered a code that is only available for redemption in the following area(s): United Kingdom, Ireland. If you are currently in an area mentioned above, please contact your Internet Service Provider for assistance.""

I'm probably going to be returning this and seeing if there's a United States equivalent. I had no idea what ""UV"" was when I bought this (I figured it was some DVD player jargon, so I glossed over that bit.), and I'd certainly like to be able to download these movies onto my phone and computer. The quote this review started with is the message ultravioletuniversal.com gives you for trying to redeem the Ultraviolet code in the United States (or Canada, or wherever else that isn't Ireland or the UK, I'd imagine).

I still love these movies. I looked at the product's information before buying, so I was curious if it would work on my PlayStation 3, my Blu-ray player. I was thrilled: They totally do! It just took the PlayStation an unusual amount of time to notice the disc was in. There seemed to be a glitch, though. I first watched Minions without a problem, then went to its special features, selecting ""Behind the Googles: The Illumination Story."" The PS3 froze for a minute, then gave me a message to the effect of ""Invalid disc."" Selected ""OK,"" (or tried to; that may have frozen also) but I definitely turned off the PS3. turned it back on, and no problems after that. Watched several special features. The ""[Region-Free]"" now also makes me assume it would work on any Blu-ray player, though I can't give you that guarantee; if others reviewed, commented on this review, or started a help thread, they might be able to help.

Still rated it five stars because it was my own ignorance that caused the (rather minor) issue around UltraViolet. Nothing against the movies or Universal, and Amazon did note that the ""UV Edition will not work in the USA (only eligible in the UK)"", even though I had no idea what that meant. Minions is one of my favorite movies, and the Despicable Me's are also a lot of fun.

Forgive me if I've made any ignorant comments about the UK and Ireland.",1453161600,9,2132,4.662234042553192

7234795,4,B00YS4V53A,"Updated review:
So when I first purchased this set - the description had no mention of it being UK/Region Free.  However, I needed a cheap physical set quickly for a long road trip to keep the rug rats entertained.  So for $22 this worked great.  Sadly, as confirmed from the other reviews and now that the description has been updated - the digital codes did not work.  However, all 3 movies worked fine in my 2017 Pacifica Blu-ray player along with my 2014 Samsung home Blu-ray player.
Now it looks like this set is even cheaper ($15) - so it all depends on your expectations.
So pay attention to your web browser address bar and/or the ASIN number in the product details.
The UK version:  B00YS4V53A
The US version:  B01DDEEWSU (there was a lightning deal for $15, but regular price seems to be $22)
Finally, it's worth noting that the US version digital codes wind up in VUDU/MoviesAnywhere.",1511568000,2,895,4.632911392405063
