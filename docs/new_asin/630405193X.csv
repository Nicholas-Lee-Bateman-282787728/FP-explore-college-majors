The only people advocating this view are those who produced this video. This is what's known as a lie. No science, no legitimate controversy, nothing that could pass muster in a peer reviewed journal or publication.",1435622400,,374,5.431034482758621

7859869,1,630405193X,"Ok this video is nonsense. Biblical flood indeed. Instead you should read The Rocks Don't Lie, David R. Montgomery. There was no biblical flood, nor was there an ark and no Noah did not collect all the animals and cart them around for a year. And just because geologists do not know the exact processes that caused the canyon that is not an excuse for a magical mystery creator. Use your brains and see the light. It is called SCIENCE.",1354147200,,435,4.45
