8064805,5,B0009POP5W,"Discovering Sculpture: The Lost Wax Technique is a fascinating examination of the third dimension in the arts, sculpture. Emphasizing the importance of the sense of touch in three dimensional art, world renowned artist Gary Schofield graphically demonstrates the technique of sculpting and casting of Bronze sculptures.

To open, there is a lot of relevant historical background here, with especially effective discussion of Ancient Greek sculpture, as well as the works of Michelangelo and the techniques he used. Schofield emphasizes the precision required in sculpting stone or marble, which, as a process of subtraction, leaves no room for error. Schofield then contrasts this with the preparation of bronze work. By demonstrating the preparation of the initial clay model though a process of both addition and subtraction, the film shows that this is an approach that would allow anyone, even a beginner, to reach the desired result through a process of trial and error guided by the sense of touch. After that the viewer is walked through a visually stunning narration of the steps used to transfer that clay model into bronze. Throughout, the soundtrack, also composed and performed by the multi talented Schofield, provides a perfect accompaniment- this DVD is worth the price for the music alone!

I have seen nothing on the market in the field of art instructional/analysis videos that can compare with this unique, high quality offering. This is a repackaging and re-release of one program in the excellent ""New Dimensions"" series, and lives up to the standard set by the series as a whole.
