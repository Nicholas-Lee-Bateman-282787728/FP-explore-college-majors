8118032,3,B000F6YWYO,"This is a wonderful opera sang by great voices, but staged by a miserable person. The Salzburg Festspiele is famous for its distorted stagings, and this ""Clemenza"" is a good example of that. The explanation of the problem is described in the DVD-booklet: ""...the greatest demands are placed on the performers if they are to present [this opera] in a convincing light, especially for an audience that sets out from completely different PRECONCEPTIONS from those that obtained in Mozart's day.""

So we now go from Mozart's conception to the conception of Mr. Kusej, the director, who makes the main character [Titus] a psychopath wreck. It is painful to look at him on the stage, running around the three-storied stage in a skirt over his pants, chewing his fingernails after scratching his hair, and presenting the type of singing what a strangely contorted face can do.

The first act - just to demonstrate Mr. Kusej's improvements over Mozart - ends with two huge and loud explosions on the stage, right after Maestro Harnoncourt's beautiful and quiet closing music ends. The two wonderful mezzo-s [Kasarova & Garanca] are visibly struggling throughout the performance to create, and sing, their operatic characters vis-a-vis the psychopath Titus.

You must be prepaired to sit through most of the performance with closed eyes, but even then you would hear the craziness of Michael Schade [Tito]. To finish this sad review, I must say that ""es ist Schade"" [it's sad] to have such a good opera destroyed by a stage director.",1419984000,6,1524,5.015810276679842

8118034,3,B000F6YWYO,"I must introduce a slightly dissenting note in the concert of praise for the 2003 Salzburg/Harnoncourt production of La Clemenza.

All the reviewers and commenters have voiced their oohs and aahs about the fine expertise of the singers and the masterful rendition of Harnoncourt and his orchestra.

But I wish to place myself in the shoes of the average opera-goer or the Mozart amateur who has fallen in love with the extraordinary music of Mozart, has become familiar with the great classic operas, the five sure crowd-pleasers and favorites of opera house managers: Entfhrung, Nozze, Don Giovanni, Cosi, and Flute, and then tries to approach the opera serias. Idomeneo has now become part of the popular repertoire thanks to Pavarotti and Behrens, but the others are still ""terra incognita"" for most opera aficionados: Mitridate, Lucio Silla, and Clemenza di Tito.

My own introduction to Clemenza was through multiple visits to the Met, first in the Standing Room section behind the orchestra seats, and later through the 1979 Dresden recording of Bhm/Peter Schreier. I, of course, adored the brilliant musical phrases and arias, but had to confess that this did not give me an immediate grasp of the complexities of this work.

It is only when I got exposed to the brilliant 1980 video interpretation of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle that I got my first full understanding of all the various facets of this tortured story, and that I was able to absorb the emotional impact of the opera.

Ponnelle's fantastic stagings started haunting me with the spectacle of those fabulous Roman ruins painted in silver-grey lighting, and the fantastic costumes derived from those at the court of 18th c. Versailles he's invented for his singers in his spectacular 1980 film. The characters all gained an extraordinary dimension, with their extraordinarily tortured emotional hangups. Every character is a walking volcano of emotional eruptions. They show it, we feel it and we hear it. The grandiose music finally felt fitted to the grandiosity of the characters and their decor.

It is initially for comparison's sake that I first tried to watch the video of this modern 2003 Harnoncourt/Salzburg production, with Harnoncourt conducting, whom I have always liked in Mozart for his energy and brio, and also because this Salzburg video figures adorable female singers.

I am not a fan of the modern productions shown in the 2006 M22 collection, although I did buy a few of its separate items, and I was not sure what to expect from this earlier (2003) performance of La Clemenza.

I appreciate the fine analyses of the singers and the musical rendition of the opera produced by our expert audiophiles/reviewers, who seem to consider the audio part as the only reality worth focusing on in this product. But I feel there's a misperception in this modern view.

Opera is not just an audio experience, savoring only the pleasures of the beautiful music. Our restricted focus on music alone is a distortion, an aberration of our modern age, thanks to the miracle of recording.
This is ""opera seria"", in its essence, its ""raison d'tre"", ""DRAMMA PER MUSICA"", a continuation of the ancient Greek tragedy performed on stage. It is, first of all, a grand VISUAL experience, where the spectacle of actors/singers is meant to feed our imagination and express the global impact of the action framed by stimulating music.
I love all the singers in this cast, especially Roschmann, Garanca, Bonney, and Kasarova, and I always appreciate Harnoncourt's energy and brio. But, all this exclusive focusing on music alone, on the quality of voices and conducting, is an abstraction, easy to write about, but is misses the core of the opera as a dramatic performance-- the DRAMMA.

It is the merit of Ponnelle to have felt in his bones that Mozart could never be rendered simply by playing his opera music in isolation from the physical personalities of his singers, and isolation from the majestic scenery of their action.

Not surprisingly, I simply could not empathize with the drama unfolding in the Harnoncourt/Salzburg production (surprisingly, 2h 34' vs 2h 15' for Ponnelle). I didn't get it, and I instinctively rejected seeing Mozart's Roman fantasy set in drab, dark, bare, naked, modern interiors (what is it, a warehouse? a multi-level parking? A residential building stripped of its facade?), that felt like a Soviet Gulag decor, with actors in underwear or somber modern costumes (which again reminded me of Soviet-ruled East Germany clothings), so radically in contrast with the splendid, luxuriant, majestic music -- in spite of the sexual shenanigans, underwear and nudity display with which modern producers try to titillate the audience.

Dropping all pretenses of sophisticated justifications, we have to admit that all this is very cheap staging costwise (my guess that spare cash explains the banality of modern stagings), compared to a full Met production, or a Ponnelle grandiose staging, and Salzburg perhaps does not have the money to mount a full grand opera by Mozart.

So, because the music of this Harnoncourt video is so splendid and the singing so fresh, so crystal-clear, and so simply entrancing, I listened to the whole opera as a real audio, by keeping the picture off screen.
And it is indeed energetic, gripping, music-making. Which on sound alone, I nearly prefer to the Karl Bhm-Peter Schreier 1979 Dresden recording, which used to be my initial favorite.

But to appreciate only the music component, as the Amazon expert reviewers here seem to be doing, you have to be already intimately conversant with the full opera. An impossible task for an average viewer. And this is where Ponnelle becomes the key that opens up the full vista and grandeur of the opera to the non-expert viewer -- a feat that this production will never achieve.

And, I doubt I would have developed a spontaneous affection for this opera if I had first seen it in this bizarre, minimalist, staging. And I am pretty sure that this opera seria is hard enough to get into for a modern opera-goer that this kind of production cannot do much to widen the popularity of La Clemenza among a modern public. It is bound to remain an item of curiosity for a few voice experts.

From the average opera-lover's perspective, there's no way the Harnoncourt/Salzburg video can compete with the grandiose power of the Ponnelle images.
To make contact with the Mozart drama visually and emotionally in its full gut-wrenching intensity, the average modern viewer -- who is not just an audio expert with little interest in the visual attraction of grand opera -- needs to revisit the images of the Ponnelle film, which, for me, remain indelibly linked to the story of Clemenza di Tito.
And the Ponnelle video is a version which has also a very fine cast of attractive singers (visually even far more attractive than the cast of the Salzburg/Harnoncourt version), and a marvelous brilliant musical rendering by James Levine and the Vienna Philarmonic.

So I respect and admire the subtlety of the delicate nuances of our reviewers in pointing out the strengths and flaws or the Salzburg singers and the slow tempi of Harnoncourt, but, whenever I hear the Overture, or an aria from the Clemenza, it's the Ponnelle images that immediately spring back into memory.

Mozart lived all his life amid the trappings of the grandest courts of 18th c. Europe, and always was infatuated with the decors and costumes of supreme elegance.
Performing a Mozart opera in an abstract, modern setting, (essentially for reasons of cost) is a major misrepresentation, that Ponnelle combated all his life.

If Mozart ever had to choose between Ponnelle/Levine and Salzburg/Harnoncourt, I feel certain he would consider the Salzburg staging a monstrosity, and wouldn't hesitate to give the nod to the Ponnelle extravaganza.
I would go further, and judge the Salzburg ""modern"" production an abomination. ""Modern"" is now, in opera criticism, the euphemism for cheapness and underwear clothing.

When, back on Feb. 22, 2010,  I reviewed the M|22 DVD set of ""The Salzburg Festspiele Opera Boxset"" of 22 operas in modern stagings at the 2006 Salzburg Mozart Festival"", I concluded with the remark that
""It still remains that the abstract and simplified stagings obscure the original magnificence of the music designed to portray actions and feelings in visually picturesque ""scenas.""

Mozart's wrote his grand music designedly for use in grand scenery. He fitted it, not only to the superlative singers then available, but also to the majestic scenery planned for the grand opera. Initially, La Clemenza was written for the coronation in Prague of Emperor Leopold II as King of Bohemia (Sept. 6, 1791).

In Mozart's mind, the only way his resplendent stately music could be fully appreciated was when specifically associated with beautiful characters dressed in the most elegant costumes of his day in the most majestic and imposing staging the state of the art could then provide. Any contemporary opera house worthy of its pre-eminent reputation would take it to heart to respect Mozart's original intention. The Met usually does, and so does, in  his own creative way, Ponnelle.

Not so, this Salzburg production. Make no mistake, this production is in no way the flesh-and-blood work as composed and envisioned by Mozart. Yes, the music component is there, but not the grand opera seria.

------------------------------------
I was recently rereading the famous interview that the great Canadian heldentenor Jon Vickers gave in 1981 to Bruce Duffie, published in ""Wagner News"", Volume XIII, No. 7 (November, 1986). Vickers expresses his view that opera is being distorted, even destroyed by the modern trend of producers who ""take the meaning out of these works, and twist them to shove their own perverse sense...down the throat of the viewing public."" They no longer want to respect the authenticity of the original opera, but turn it into an expression of their own superior artistic personality. Instead of serving the work, they use the work to serve their purpose of ""star"" aggrandizement:

""[T]he difficulty that is happening is that the whole of the operatic world in terms of production is in a state of flux.  The whole world of production is going through such convolutions and upheavals of trying to find a new direction, a new way, a new method of illumination and the tragic aspect of this striving that is going on is that many people (and I might say the popularity of opera itself is contributing to this) is giving opportunity to human beings who call themselves producers, like some singers in our present generation, to use the works of art, the great works of art themselves for their own particular purpose.  They take the meaning of these works and twist them to shove their own perverse sense, their own perverted philosophies down the throat of the viewing public, and that is a fact and that is happening in Germany to such a tremendous extent today that it's frightening."" (Jon Vickers, 1981)

This Salzburg production of ""Clemenza di Tito"" is a good example of what Jon Vickers denounces as the distortion of opera by modern producers.
------------------------------

When I expressed a similar evaluation on YouTube about the video of the Salzburg/Harnoncourt production, I was taken to task by a ""bogdiworksV2"", some lover of modernistic productions. I answered:

Yes, you say it very well: ""It's an abstract happy ending..."".
But not only the ending, the whole production is an abstract interpretation, as you emphasize: ""the story is the story, regardless of the setting: lust for power, seduction, friendship, the alienation of those in power from those around them.""

This kind of license reduces the concrete fabric of the story - Rome, Empire, princesses, burning of Rome, crowns, and imperial edicts - to mere concepts, abstract ideas.

It's the plague of modernism, radicalized by political correctness, of trying to forget our concrete existence - as human bodies of flesh, organs, blood, anchored in space on our planet, and in time in a specific slice of history, in a specific culture with its habits and biases - to be reduced to ""human beings"" with feelings that are made up of the same kind of abstractions, ""lust for power, seduction, friendship, alienation"", not anchored anywhere but floating freely in imagination, with no regards for ""settings"", which are pooh-poohed as a mere frivolity in this imaginary universe where everything can be played out by ""human beings"" anywhere, on the moon, in an deep sub-oceanic cave, hey, even in a multi-stage parking garage.

It's like reducing the Star Wars dramas to a conflict of two opposed insect colonies on some dead branch in the African savannah. Yep, ""the story is the story, regardless of the setting...""

This wonderful kind of post-modernist validation is a blessing for any cash-strapped production, and it can be retroactively applied to rework the whole operatic (and theatrical as well) repertoire into creative productions in underwear (as was done for the ""Belle Helene"", for instance). When in fact the unrevealed underlying factor is lack of cash, lack of resources.

We are in an age when we, paradoxically, try to affirm our restoration of real history, of authentic instruments, authentic texts cleaned of alterations and bowdlerizations, authentic personalities, bared of the sanctimonious masks that a pious posterity has erected on their dead figures.

So, as for us, fanatical Mozart purists, we want to reconnect with the authentic vision of the drama as conceived by Mozart:
- with its grand characters (nothing less than kings, emperors, nobles and traitors, will do),
- its grand decors (usually palaces and grand temples),
- its grand passions,
- its grand costumes.
- its grandest voices. Mozart was lucky to always have at his disposal the best voices of Europe, and he wrote specifically for theses voices, their brilliances, and their limitations.

Coming from a middle-class background, but exposed since infancy to the best standards of the upper classes, Mozart always wanted to deal with only the finest examples of everything, and his works were rooted in that universe of extreme elegance and sumptuosity.

The matter of dress was, for example, of capital importance to Mozart. Mozart was fanatic to the point of fetishism about the high quality of his dress. Every morning in Vienna, the ""coiffeur"" (hairdresser) would come to his house and do his hair. Since early childhood he had been accustomed to wearing the fanciest dress of the aristocracy, and whenever he conducted, he always made a huge splash in his expensive, flamboyant costume.
He couldn't think of appearing in drab, ordinary garments. He was attracted to the noblest clothes, the noblest materials, making a grand fuss in Vienna to find the right buttons for one of his magnificent jackets. He was exaggeratedly proud of his appearance. All his voice music was destined to top singers in exquisite attire. Mozart would have never written any music for any singer wearing the kind of cheap costumes used by modern producers. To suppose that he would have accepted the kind of costumes used by Salzburg is a fantasy alien to the Mozart vision of his world.

So, yes, any modern interpretation of La Clemenza can find a mental or rhetorical justification for our modern brains, and please those modern masses deprived of historic sense, and who have never read the libretto or even any of Mozart's letters. But it matters not, it is not the opera as conceived and projected by Mozart. And no amount of rhetoric can convince us of this legerdemain.

In a nutshell: I would never visit again this caricature: ""La Clemenza di Tito"" in a goulag-like German parking garage! Modern opera productions are abominations dictated by the lack of cash to create authentic scenery, buy authentic costumes, and hire top singers up to the task of  singing in mellifluous Italian. The ambition is much larger than the bank account.
In an age when we claim our obsession with authenticity and historicity in all aspects of art, opera production has become too often in our century an isolated island where monstrosities are allowed that have only the music as the only link to their original. Forget the ""dramma"" and the show. Cost of ""historic"" productions is the bane of modern stage directors. They finesse it with ""creative"" ""concepts"" that jettison any pretense of authentic rendition of the original opera. They invent costumes and settings that are superficial, ephemeral, and that nobody will remember.

To reconnect with the real ""Clemenza di Tito"", better listen to the music on the DG/Karl Boehm 1979 CD or this Salzburg/Harnoncourt 2003 video as audio, which gives us at least Harnoncourt's nervous conducting and his lovely voices, and watch the DG/Levine/Ponnelle 1980 DVD to remember that Tito was a real Roman emperor, and not some cartoonish figure, and you'll get much closer to the original Mozart work.

The wife of the new Emperor Leopold II, Maria Louisa, gave, as the legend goes, her Spanish evaluation of the work after the first performance on Sept. 6, 1791 in Prague, where the coronation of Leopold II was taking place -- ""una porcheria tedesca"".
And, to paraphrase her, we, Mozart purists, are justified in finding this Salzburg kind of production, a bit tongue-in-cheek, and certainly more appreciative of the Salzburg effort than Maria Luisa, but still disgusted by the miserable staging and setting that destroys the grandeur and nobility of the piece, ""UNA PORCHERIA MODERNA"".

8118035,5,B000F6YWYO,"This dvd was purchased as a gift for a fellow lover of the best musical instrument;  the human voice. I purchased the original release of this 2003 performance several years ago but never put my feelings for it into print until now.
After approximately 20 viewings over the years, this has moved to number three on my list of opera favorites. Being a Verdi nut, Traviata and Rigoletto are Numbers one and two. Essentially perfect operas because Verdi in his middle period never lets the incredible music stop. If Mozart had cut the last act of Figaro in half, It would move up to be included in my top five.
This is not written as a commentary on my taste, so on to the issue of La clemenza di Tito. This singspiel, in my opinion is the best opera that Mozart wrote. His love for the clarinet comes into play a couple of times but the use of the basset clarinet in Vitellia's final aria is truly wonderful. The cast is as good as it gets and as a group, certainly far above those of the other dvd's available. Speaking of other available videos, I have owned or seen them all and although many will accept only these period performances, in my opinion (and that's what it is, folks)  they are all unwatchable compared to this performance.
That's the good stuff: conductor and cast clearly a dream team.
The only thing that will turn some people off is some aspects of the stage direction. The director introduces some nonsensical bits
that certainly could and should have been omitted. However, producing a quality opera may be the most difficult of all stagings, so
grit your teeth through the few silly bits and enjoy the great music and singing.",1389398400,6,1648,4.545454545454546
8118036,4,B000F6YWYO,"This recording of Mozart's La Clemenza, recorded in 2003 at the Salzburg Festival is, to my mind, a successful production although there are clearly some challenging aspects as regards the updating decisions which will not appeal to all viewers.

The production is largely in modern dress with the exception of Titus who is attired in a flowing skirt-like item for much of the time. The scenery essentially makes use of the theatre building to create a series of separate chambers or rooms in which the action between the cast members takes place. The props can only described as minimalist and Spartan - nothing approaching any form of luxury or social advantage that one might expect of a ruler and his associates. The chorus makes its first entrance as modern tourists with Titus appearing to be an exhibited model who then springs to life and addresses his subjects. At the beginning and at the end a large number of these cubicles is peopled with a young coy in each dressed in just his underwear pants, the significance escaped me. This is the only part of the production that causes me any unease.

Moving on to the singing the considerations are much easier to deal with as this is a uniformly top quality cast of young singer/actors who all fulfil their sung and dramatic roles to perfection in my opinion. In the course of the opera the full gamut of intended emotional expression is fully met and matters of conflicting loyalties, and considerations of offices of power and how those responsibilities can conflict with personal relationships is fully and powerfully met. Michael Schade makes an excellent Titus as he struggles with his various dilemmas and in this he is equally matched by Vesselina Kasarova as the equally compromised Sesto. She is good at trouser roles. Elina Garanca is a convincing Annio, also a trouser role and Dorothea Roschmann portrays the ambitious and jealously driven Vitellia. Both Publio and Servilia are well delivered in their lesser roles by Luca Pisaroni and Barbara Bonney respectively.

The Vienna Philharmonic are on good form and produce glorious playing of power and bite under the firm guidance of Nicholas Harnoncourt who makes sure of the dramatic drive.

The camera work is very good and provides imaging of fine detail and colour definition. The sound is well-balanced, full-toned and of impressive presence. It is presented in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1 and in stereo options.

This essentially seems to be an attempt to portray this drama as a timeless exploration of power, conflict, corruption and ultimate clemency and is, to my mind, very successful. This is in spite of my reservations about certain aspects of the production as described above. In my opinion the very sparseness adds to the concentration of the drama and the fine musical and dramatic values maintained throughout at all levels manage to overcome those doubts.  It has given me increasing satisfaction each time I have watched it and has significantly increased my admiration and love of this late work of Mozart which I would now rank as one of his finest achievements.

For those who consider musical and dramatic delivery as the priority over production issues this may well prove to be especially rewarding and well worth a 5 star rating. This would be my personal verdict but bearing in mind production issues as described above I feel that 4 stars may well be more appropriate for most interested purchasers.",1352246400,14,3434,4.951388888888889
8118037,4,B000F6YWYO,"Since there was no ""Clemenza"" to wrap-up the M22 series of complete Mozart operas given for the composers' 250th birthday in 2006 in Salzburg, Deutsche Grammophon decided to ""borrow"" from TDK this stimulating performance from the 2003 festival. I was happy to see that Kusej (of Don Giovanni fame) was in charge of the production while I was very concerned about what Harnoncourt would do of the music.

As it stands, Harnoncourt is one of the stars of the evening: his reserved tempi are in now way interfering with the progression of the drama, the music unfolds with grace and momentum, and his attention to detail is phenomenal. Never has the Wiener Philharmoniker (in this collection) sounded more opulent or consistent. As a result, Harnouncourt's failure in ""Le Nozze"" is all the more impossible to comprehend, in light of the musical success of this ""Clemenza"".

Dramatically, this is almost as good: the best example to give is probably the way the Recitativi are polished. Here, the combination of Kusej's stimulating production and the talent of the actor/singers, not to forget the harpsichordist - help us get into the flesh and soul of all these six characters, all with clear and well-defined motivations.

Kusej's production, albeit successful, is less focused than its Don Giovanni efforts. The Felsenreitschule is organised as a three-floor building which, according to the demands of the inszenierung, can be either a home, an office, a palace, a museum or all of this at the same time. The setting is resolutely modern and addresses the consequences and the collateral damage of a political plot and a raging assassination attempt. This would be very good were it not for the uncertainty of the motivations of the main character, Tito, the most ill-defined of all: gentle leader? paranoid tyran? weak Nero? The production never decides what it wants to make of the title role and this is where we find the limits of this otherwise convincing production.

Vocally, it is great to see the beginnings of Elina Garanca and Luca Pisaroni, who would both be called to do bigger and better things: they are both superb. Dorothea Roschmann is much more ""in character"" than in the pitiful ""Nozze"" already mentioned and she can let her voice's big sound go for it and fill the house: she is sublime and very lyrical. Barbara Bonney is the living example that age has no grip on vocal quality when a voice is well taken care of while Vesselina Kasarova, as Sesto, is the star of the evening. Vocally, this great ensemble is slightly let down by the uncertain Michael Schade, who finds the virtuosity of the part mostly difficult for him - but then who has ever sung this part properly?

Overall a very stimulating Tito suffering from a weak lead and an unfocused production at times but what an ensemble of singers! What a conductor! What an orchestra! and what a talent to have this contrite opera seria fly like a Hitchcok movie!",1349827200,3,2940,4.860279441117765

8118039,4,B000F6YWYO,"There is no getting around the problem that an opera which requires two natural sopranos, two castrati sopranos, one tenor and one bass cannot achieve a dramatic equilibrium. Perhaps pants roles can be made to work for those sitting in the far reaches of the auditorium but not when camera closeups allow us to count each bead of sweat on a performers brow.
The two male roles are ably sung but the scenes in which they interact with their loved ones simply fail to be convincing.
I found the tenor playing the Emperor lacking in the dramatic weight one expects of a stage monarch (even though reality often fails to meet the criterion). The bass playing The Leaders Chief of Police also lacks the sonorous qualities required to lend weight to The Mighty Caesar.
With all this, and a set reminiscent of Broadway in the 30's and 40's (as well as the Busby Berkely musicals) the performers rise to the occasion and give us a satisfying (if not thrilling) version of the Master's composition. Certainly, it is more than adequate to take its place in the Mozart 22 Collection.

I'm always dubious about more contemporary productions, but this one really didn't bother me except I never understood the men's skirts and in such ugly (glittery) fabric.

I had never heard Schade before and he did take some getting  used to. He rather reminds me of a tenor Hampson, the timbre and the way he uses his mouth. This is not a criticism, merely my obervation.

I found all the singers really quite stunning, and Roschmann was

terrific, particularly in one of the more difficult roles ever written for a, um, normal female. As for Kasarova, I, too, was disappointed that her pianissimi didn't really show up to any advantage.

As for Bonney, as much as I like and admire her, I felt that the bloom was off the rose, although that may not be fair since I've only heard her sing very lyrical roles, none requiring anything gutsy or glottal.",1152403200,20,960,4.558139534883721
8118041,4,B000F6YWYO,"I saw photos of this show on operajaponica and other sites before it was released, but they don't do it justice. The two trouser roles are marvellously sung and believable! Kasarova and Garanca may not look butch but one won't forget they're playing male characters. And the romantic scenes are tastefully done, and don't look gratuitous (gotta show how Vitellia controls Sesto, after all). There is no nudity in it (Vitellia changes her clothes a lot on stage,but she is always covered).

The singing is wonderful. 'Vitellia''s music is extremely difficult and Dorothea Roeschmann acts all out on stage very convincingly. Her Vitellia really comes to life ..all blood and guts! As convincingly in-character during the arias as in the recitatives.

Vesselina Kasarova is the gold standard Sesto today. She sings breathtaking pianissimo, but that carries more effect when heard live than recorded. She is known for her soft-singing for good reasons. And when she abruptly blasts you with ff passages straight out from a pp and then right back to it in pieces like 'Deh, per questo istante solo', the effect is very dramatic. What a fascinating artist! Everything she does  enhances her story telling. This Sesto isn't a wimpy caricature (like all the other versions on film.. Paris included) but a man who, presented with a choice of either his lover or his friend, decides on his own that he could live without Tito. A passionate and believeable performance by one of best 'Sesto' ever.

Kasarova, Roeschmann, and Schade share the rare quality of being able to make what they sing sound so spontaneously natural with their acting and not like they are singing a rehearsed music at all.

Young Elina Garanca is a revelation to me. I did not like her in the Vienna 'Werther' DVD, tho much was the fault of the stage direction, but she turns in a very natural 'Annio' here. Not very facially expressive yet. Good chemistry (barring a disconnected look during the love duet) with the gorgeous Barbara Bonney's 'Servilia', who turns in another outstanding performance. Her top may not be as crystaline as before (and I wish she wasn't made to do so much singing lying down during 'S'altro che lagrima'), but otherwise she is exquisite.

Michael Schade plays 'Tito', and gosh he looks hot! Sweating like he's trying to flood the town. Was there a heat wave in Salzburg during that festival? He sings wonderfully, tho. Here is a tenor who can and does sing softly to great effects (tho, like Kasarova's, his pianissimo is often barely audible in the recording). Vocally there isn't a better Tito out there today. His 'insane' choreography takes some getting used to. It's as if he's been watching Vincent D'Onofrio too much. Very neurotic. I thought Tito is supposed to be a bit more sane looking. Truth be told, his mentally iffy Tito does make it understandable why Sesto would choose Vitellia (for all her touchiness) over him.

The young bass Luca Pisaroni acts and sings 'Publio' perfectly, tho his Publio seems to think the 'Se al volto mai ti senti' trio in Act II is a scene where he wants to bed Sesto and Vitellia... Apparently Kusej has Publio out looking for love in all the wrong places through out the opera (wrong places for Publio, that is). All in all, there just isn't a weak link in this cast!

The set is clever; a modern 3 stories see-through building and the actors/singers have to navigate the thing  sometimes singing ensemble pieces from different levels! It works great since they can show actions away from the singer doing his/her aria so it isn't static like other productions tend to be. I especially love the burning of Rome sequence and like the use of lighting to direct attention to the characters key to the scene.

Maestro Harnoncourt is excellent in the pit. He sets quite slow tempi (but the music doesn't drag). This makes this production quite a bit longer than the others (tho it helps that the recitatives are shorter in general). Harnoncourt succeeds in bringing out all the nuances in Mozart's last opera with it, tho. And he has a cast of singers with superb techniques capable of coping with the tempi. As a result this production is much more dramatically affecting than the others. The 2 clarinet-soloists are marvellous in the two obbligato arias, too.

I enthusiastically recommend this DVD. A gorgeous musical performance that is passionately acted, too. There are clips from 6 other TDK releases on the 2nd disc (from: Don Giovanni, Die Zauberflote, Ariadne auf Naxos, Un ballo in maschera, Turandot, and Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail).

PS: A star is omitted because of some choreography for the chorus (and those boys in underwear) is so abstract I can't understand it even after many viewings. It is still the best production of this opera on DVD, in my opinion.",1147996800,51,4810,4.84531059683313
