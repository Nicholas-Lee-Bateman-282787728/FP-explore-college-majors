Maybe watch it with the sound off.  The acting, especially the Dr. Goodhead character, is atrocious.  The screenplay was seemingly written by a 10-year-old boy.

 Another globetrotting extravaganza in another Bond film.  This time we trek with Sir Roger Moore as 007 on location to Paris, London, Guatemala, Italy, Brazil, the USA, as well as outer space.  Moonraker has a Sci-fi bent,  so if you enjoy Space Shuttles, you are in luck!  Dr. Goodhead and James pilot a shuttle called a Moonraker to save earth's human inhabitants from a megalomaniacal space dictator Hugo Drax plotting to decimate humanity on earth while also colonizing space.

Sadly,  During the filming of Moonraker, Sir Roger Moore needed a kidney operation,  but production only halted about a week while he had the procedure. You would never know while enjoying this film that he had had a medical affliction pop up during the production, as he carries himself with a Brit's fortitude.

Jaws the giant from the prior film ""the Spy Who Loved Me"" shows back up in Moonraker,  and is still after Bond but quite unexpectedly the two- Jaws and 007-  reconcile at the end. You don't see reconciliation that often in good guy vs. bad guy films, but it lends a unique dose of humor to Moonraker.

In summary, I'm especially glad to have seen this for the fabulous scenery and action.",1509062400,,1304,4.81981981981982

1398669,5,B000056OCJ,"Roger Moore is my absolute favorite Bond. I love his 'dry British humour' ($10 to the first person to catch that reference) & his utterly unflappable presence. Moonraker is a combination of all the awesome things Moore brings to the table: Winking humour, high flying set-pieces, Rube Goldberg gadgets galore, a mustache twirling villain w a vague Eastern European visage & an, apparently, unlimited bank account (eat your heart out Elon Musk!) w AWESOME retro futurism @ every turn AND, obviously, who can ever forget Bond's GREATEST foe?: MISTER METALMOUTH, HIMSELF, JAWS! And, not just regular Jaws, BUT, JAAAWSS INNN SPAAACE!! Doctor's recommendation: Cuddle up w someone special, smoke a fatty, order a giant version of your favorite  pie & throw on this bad boy.

1398670,4,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker (1979) attempted to cash in on the sci-fi craze that was sweeping the country after the enormous success of Star Wars. In fact, after The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), the next film announced was For Your Eyes Only, but that film was shelved until 1981 in order to make this goofy (yet respectable) Bond film. If the goal was to make a sci-fi experience through and through, then the creators failed, because the 'sci-fi' element is present only toward the end of the film. And why (WHY) was Jaws brought back? He has no place in this film, and his sophomore outing threatens to diminish the great performance in The Spy Who Loved Me, as he's goofy here, and even expresses infatuation for a woman. That's not the Jaws we know; he was much more serious and intimidating in the previous film. While this film has its share of over-the-top and unrealistic scenes, it still manages to sport some serious scenes, and the settings are first-rate. The special effects are good for the time as well. The blu ray picture and sound quality are pristine, and the special features are very good. Overall, I recommend this blu ray for fans of the James Bond franchise; I wouldn't say this film is for die hard fans only- it's essential.",1493078400,,1229,4.590909090909091

1398695,2,B000056OCJ,"I watched Moonraker again recently to see if it was as bad as I remembered. The answer? Not quite, but almost.

The Bond producers have often tried to ride the coattails of pop culturefor instance, developments in politics, tech, or entertainmentwith mixed results. With Live and Let Die, it was Black Power. With License to Kill, it was Miami Vice. With Goldeneye, it was the Internet. With Casino Royale, it was cell phones (particularly texting). Nowhere was this more blatant than with Moonraker, which tried to cash in on the original Star Wars, released a couple of years previously. The result was a disastrous foray into not merely Bond-style space-age escapism, which the producers had veered into in prior films such as Doctor No, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever, but pure, unapologetic science fiction (at least for the final third of the movie). And it was science fiction done badly, with effects that were quite cheesy compared to those of Star Wars as well as Alien and the first Star Trek motion picture (both of the latter being released the same year as Moonraker) and on the small screen Battlestar Galactica, which had debuted the previous year. And lets face it: Once Star Wars had taken us to a galaxy far far away, and Star Trek had taken us throughout the Alpha Quadrant, Earth orbit is pretty tame. But this was by no means the worst part of the film.

The main problem with Moonraker was that in the spots when it wasn't deliberately being silly, it was insufferably ponderous. The whole thing just seemed to be executed by people who lacked interest and energy. Even John Barrys score sounds as if he were exhausted when he wrote it and as if the musicians were bored while performing it; even the old standby Bond themes were rendered at an almost sleepy tempo. Not even Shirley Bassey can rescue the title song (a far cry from her tour de force in Goldfinger and not even as good as Diamonds are Forever). By this point Roger Moore, besides not seeming very interested in his role in Moonraker, is too old for Bond. In the following film the producers get around this nicely by having the script embrace that fact; but for that exception, Moore should have bowed out by this point.

The other leads are even bigger problems. Lois Chiless Holly Goodhead is among the least memorable Bond Girls in the history of the franchise. Utterly lacking any chemistry with (and even interest in) Roger Moore, and bereft of any backstory or character development other than the fact that shes a scientist with an implicit chip on her shoulder (please guys, I get feminism, but it just aint gonna fly in a traditional Bond film even if you put it in a space shuttle), shes simply uninteresting from any angle. (Among other things, she meets Kronsteens assessment of Rosa Klebb in the novel From Russia, With Love: a sexual neuter. She sleeps with Bond, but doesnt show any interest in the fact either before, during, or after.) She doesnt even do anything to further the plot; she could easily have been written out of the script and wed barely have noticed.

Michael Lonsdales Drax is even worse. Utterly uninteresting and one-dimensional, he shows less emotion than a dishrag. Lonsdale was (thankfully) the last of the franchises Stalinist megalomaniacs bend on world destruction/domination, but he cant even get revved up about the fact that hes planning to destroy the entire freaking world and start over. The only good thing that can be said of him is that apparently he made the producers recognize the error of their ways and ditch the concept forthwith. Beginning with the very next film, the template for the Bond Villain changed dramatically (as symbolized by Bonds dropping Blofeld down a chimney during the opening sequence). After Drax, Bond Villains became much more human, much more life-size, and much more interesting, sometimes driven by inner demons (e.g., Le Chiffre in 2006s Casino Royale; the new incarnation of Blofeld in 2015s Spectre), and usually fixated on making piles of money or carrying out revenge on someone (understandable and relatable and life-sized goals) rather than destroying the earth (again). Alas, to get to that point, we have to suffer through Drax.

So much for the ponderous; now for the silly. As time passed, the franchise began to drop in small humorous touches that, in small doses, didn't detract from the seriousness of the main themes. At first they provided a touch of light relief, but eventually they became too heavy-handed. This was a particular problem during the Roger Moore films, partly because Moore, more than any other Bond, played the role for laughs. In Moonraker the laughs (or rather, attempts at laughs) are far overdone. The worst part of this is what the producers do with Jaws. In the previous film, the considerably better The Spy Who Loved Me, Jaws was an intimidating, deadly villain (and yet another homage to pop culture; see above) who could produce laughs (usually through his indestructibility) without betraying his fundamentally threatening nature. In Moonraker, from the outset, the producers deliberately make him a purely comic figure, and one who isn't even any good at killing people. Geez, guys, if I want comedy Ill go see The Pink Panther (just like if I want sci-fi Ill go see Star Trek/Wars).

Something that the Bond cinematic franchise never seems to have gotten is that whenever it incorporates original Ian Fleming material, the film is almost always better than when it ignores Fleming. All of the best Bond films are Fleming-derived, such as From Russia, With Love, For Your Eyes Only (which immediately followed and nicely recovered from Moonraker), and 2006s superb Casino Royale. Admittedly, nearly all of the Fleming material has been mined, but with a little ingenuity it can be reused. With Moonraker the producers ignored practically everything in the original novel, even the elements that weren't dated and could have been adapted easily. This is yet another reason for this films failure to measure up.

I was young and crazy for all things Bond when Moonraker came out (and I remain to this day quite the Fleming aficionado), so back in the day I stuck with the films after this one. But if the franchise hadnt redeemed itself with For Your Eyes Only, I might have found it very hard to keep watching Bond films in the wake of the train wreck (or shuttle wreck, or whatever) that was Moonraker.",1481241600,,6435,4.855191256830601

1398707,3,B000056OCJ,"If you are a fan of Roger Moore's take on James Bond, then there is a good chance you probably even like Moonraker. Despite all of it's notoriously bad press, with a reputation of being recognized as the worst James Bond movie (Die Another Day owns that title), theres a fair amount of entertainment to be had from Moonraker, and after all, thats what it's all about anyways.

Of all of the 007 films in the Roger Moore series, Moonraker may actually even have the best locales. Starting with the intro in the sky going to California, Venice, Rio, Argentina and of course space. Locales are important to these movies, because it's apart of the escapist experience the action/adventure genre thrives on, the more places we can go as an audience, the more exciting it is to watch these films. The main villain, Mr. Drax, isn't a terribly memorable one, but does feature the classic Bond villain archetype of being an eccentric mega-corporation ruler.

Space seemed to be the next logical place to go after of course the huge success of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (referenced by the theme played on the keypad to enter the secret room), and truth be told it wasn't a bad idea. Had they just kept some of the near constant puns and silliness out of it, like the scene with Jaws finding 'true love' after a great cable car sequence, I think it may have gotten a little more respect. However some of the shoddy special effect work didn't help, it's 1979 and they're still using those horrible fake backgrounds.

There is no specific Bond car in this one, but the boat hang glider, gondola hovercraft and spaceship were pretty decent replacements. There also doesn't seem to be one or two particular Bond girls, but rather a handful of them, all of which seem to be capable of performing their duties. Shirley Bassey's final Bond theme may be one of the most overlooked aspects of Moonraker, it captures the essence of the original themes but also shows the modernization that is to come.

Because this was the most expensive 007 movie up to this point (reportedly costing more than the first 6 movies combined!) they were able to do some things that really impressed visually. Starting with the giant Drax control center for one, and for two of course the massive space station. Both  are on a scale that we have really never even been close seeing before in this series. If you can watch Moonraker knowing that it isn't serious (and it's not trying to be) then in the very least you will find some entertaining moments.

1398752,5,B000056OCJ,Moonraker is perhaps the ultimate Roger Moore Bond movie from the height of cheesiness. Moore's Bond looks like a lecherous old man hitting on 20-something girls. The villain is one of my favorites; Hugo Drax has probably the best lines of any villain in the entire series of films. And the film is filled with so many tongue-in-cheek jokes that it makes Daniel Craig just seem like a far-too-serious grumpy fart. My only regret is that they couldn't somehow put Jaws and Sheriff J.W. Pepper in the same episode.,1459209600,,512,4.764044943820225

That said, the movie is actually one of Moore's better Bond movies.  Drax is a grade higher than serviceable as a Bond villain, the plot is a bit fantastical but laid out nicely, the movie score is excellent, and the movie is well paced with plenty of classic Bond action.  The movie has probably the best and most believable scene in which the villain kills one of his employees - Drax unleashing his dogs on a nice female worker who betrays him by helping Bond.

1398834,3,B000056OCJ,"I've revised my opinion of this film on a recent watch. It's not horrible, but the space sequence simply does not close the film with a bang. There are too many details it gets wrong, even if it was well-intentioned and had a good budget for the time.

The station and its many elements fail to jell as a believable or realistic thing: sound in space, badly scaled explosions (sparks, fire, debris, etc.) inconsistent and badly explained artificial gravity, a badly designed irregular station - why did not they go with a classic donut or L-5 design (especially since it was meant as a permanent base)? etc.
Maybe the sequence needed a better set up for all the individual elements, but as it is it just fizzles.

I feel that with careful design Bond can and should have a realistic and suspenseful sequence in space (if they ever decide to take the current Bond to space, get Cuaron to direct the sequence, at least,) but this was not it.

I thought the Maya connection was clever - since the 'Chariots of the Gods' phenomenon had already linked Maya culture to space travel.
But the irregular shape of the space station makes it not only unfeasible for generating artificial gravity but distances it from traditional space design (as it is are we meant to think that the station 'floor' is correctly oriented to take advantage of the rotation shown? Because it clearly is not.) A man floats towards a chair to sit down - in zero G no less, and other Amazon Women on the Moon styled goofs that make the whole segment inconsistent and ultimately unbelievable.
2001, Disney docs (The Black Hole did a pretty good, old fashioned job at it) and countless low-budget Japanese or other international efforts had already shown us what was required.

Sometimes it does help to have some knowledge of what one is attempting to present onscreen and care to do it (or at least not ignore what is already generally known,) since we are meant to be witnessing a primitive space dwelling system and not the advanced, and fictional artificial gravities of Star Wars and Star Trek. My point is that a more 'nuts and bolts' approach would have helped the film - less [fanciful] lasers & more [realistic] darts inside a space station.

The idea of the private sector developing space vehicles is not only a Heinlein idea, it it probably prescient now that NASA is pretty much gone out of business.",1446422400,,2380,4.670644391408114

1398838,5,B000056OCJ,"Okay, I really don't understand why so many people hate this movie.  Yes, it's ridiculous and perhaps the campiest Bond film (at least until Die Another Day.)  Yes, the plot is convoluted and seems haphazardly strung-together.  But who cares?  While it may border on self-parody, it does it with such panache and joyful abandon that I can hardly muster the effort to give a crap.  The beautiful locations, the amazing sets, the breathtaking Lois Chiles, the unforgettable one-liners, etc.

It also has my favorite Bond villain, Hugo Drax, whose megalomania is so extreme that he wants to remake the world in his image.  Michael Lonsdale's performance is wonderfully aloof and eccentric, and the way he delivers his lines is so acidic that you can almost taste his self-absorbed misanthropy.  While we've seen this sort of pompous, psychotic villain in previous Bond films, Hugo Drax takes it to another level.  He's the best thing about Moonraker, and he steals every scene he's in.

Bottom line, this movie never fails to put a smile on my face, and though it may not be the best the franchise has to offer, for my money it's the most rewatchable and shamelessly entertaining. Crazy and silly it may be, but it's also a hell of a lot of fun.",1444348800,,1242,4.761682242990654

1398848,2,B000056OCJ,"Bond goes galactic in this crappy, slappy attempt to capture the 2001 vibe without upsetting his usual audience. Those genres make for an exceptionally awkward match under the very best circumstances, of course, and this attempt is far from graceful. Poor special effects and an absurdly loose grasp on physics and technology kneecap the orbital scenes, while a redundant gauntlet of traps and action sets, plus a dry, repetitive bit of recon work, spoils the Earthbound action. It's a bad spy movie, but a terrible sci-fi movie. Bond has never before felt so formulaic and played-out. It seems like the series has blazed through a dozen boat chases by this point, and they all feel like the same scene set upon a slightly different waterway. The random addition of GI Joe-grade laser weaponry, plus a continuing descent into forced, groan-worthy one liners, makes this installment feel like a particularly pedestrian dose of self satire. It doesn't help that the screen is so thoroughly drenched with blunt, obvious product placement, either. A real sellout moment for the series, ditching its soul in favor of an expired, gimmicky flavor-of-the-month that can't even justify its own existence. Worst of the entire franchise? It's certainly in the running.",1434931200,,1257,5.166666666666667

1398850,5,B000056OCJ,"While the incredible stunts and sets of The Spy Who Loved me may have seemed difficult to follow up, Eon Productions jacks up the ante here with even greater spectacle! For example, while the former film had a spectacular ski jump off of Mount Asgard, this one has a classic skydiving stunt that's just stupendous, there are amazing locations, and huge sets (the great chamber where bond fights an anaconda, the Mondrian room, and the space station itself, not to forget the shoot-out at the end!

The plot of the film is not great - industrialist Hugo Drax is building space shuttles, and the plot replicates The Spy Who Loved Me nearly perfectly, but inverts it - while Kronstad plotted to rebuild civilisation under the sea, Drax uses space to rise above the genocide he and his beautiful people plan for Earth's population (yet another ultimate Nazi eugenicist). The story also lifts Jaws from the previous film, and re-enacts the amazing battle between good and evil that you see in Thunderball, except this time with lasers and space suits! Bond has also found another spy to love him, this time one who works for the CIA. The film hardly uses anything from the book, which is a sedate tale set completely in the UK that incorporates casino shenanigans with a resurrected Nazi working with the Soviets to destroy London.

The film has great settings that jump around a lot - one sequence that's supposed to be set all in Brazil moves from Rio to Argentina to Italy to Florida to Guatemala! Another supposedly set in California intersects with scenes actually shot in France, ha ha. Drax's assistant Corrinne Dufour is altogether too helpful to Bond - what's her motivation to betray her boss, yet another inexplicable traitress for Bond? Great scenes in Venice, including a gondola chase, and a cheezy scene when the gondola converts to an amphibious hovercraft, giving Roger Moore new opportunities to wryly smile and wave at people. Great battle scenes in a Rio gondola, ambulance capers, and the beautiful Emily Bolton as 007's Brazil contact Manuela! Awesome shots at Iguazu Falls as Jaws takes a boat over the edge, Bond escaping on a paraglider. Ultra creepy Jaws stalker at the Rio Carnival. Jaws and his girlfriend Dolly (big chest, pony tails, librarian glasses) are pretty cheezy, but it's funny when Richard Kiel breaks his silence at the end - oh, seems he could speak all along! Sort of a Simpsons moment!! Cheezy love theme when Jaws and Dolly see each other, parodied mercilessly in Top Secret! Bond as Leone's The Man With No Name in his poncho and cowboy hat - rancho spy camp! Cold beauties. Rocket exhaust was apparently falling salt from miniatures. Executive producer Michael Wilson gets a cameo as a radar operator at 1:39:05, his voice clearly dubbed. Colonel Gogol has a cameo (as he does in the next film), with dialogue stolen from Star Wars, ""steady... steady...!"" Great sexy references: ""My God, what's Bond doing?"" ""I think he's attempting re-entry, sir."" Cheezy final lines - ""James - take me around the world one more time...""

This film marked the last appearance of Bernard Lee as M, who died of stomach cancer in 1981 before he could film any scenes for For Your Eyes Only. It was also the last ""escalating overblown"" Bond, as For Your Eyes Only pared things back in terms of outrageous spectacle.

As usual, the DVD is full of extras, although not as many as other Bond films on DVD.

Declassified: MI6 Vault contains ""Ken Adam's Production Film"" (11:30), with shots from Iguazu Falls, covered Brazil in two Lear jets scouting for locations. Landing in Rio, Guatemala Mayan temples, on yacht, in Chateau de Vaux-Le-Vicompte. Concorde landing with dancing at 5:00 AM, Venice, gondola yards, funeral boat. Adam mentions how in this film the old team of Bond-makers was disappearing. ""For me, it was the end of Bond"", and this was his last film in the series. ""Circus Footage"" (1:10) shows some of the unused big top footage, with the attempt to have Jaws collide with tight rope artists. They had shots of Jaws emerging from the collapsed tent, but it's gone lost, only have stills. ""Bond '79"" (11:00), includes interview pieces with Albert Broccoli, Lewis Gilbert, Roger Moore, Lois Chiles. ""We had to update them, we have to advance ourselves with the story."" ""Sean, physically, is a much tougher individual than I am; it was easier to accept him as a killer than me. My sense of humour has to overcome that."" Moore bond has more humour. ""Skydiving Test Sequence"" (3:55) establishes that it's possible to film a fight in the air, with a specially-designed camera to do it with.

007 Mission Control: ""Exotic Locations"" (4:28) shows the US, France, Italy, Brazil, Guatemala, LAX and Drax's space factory at Rockwell International in California, then the Georges Pompidou Centre as Drax's lab.

Mission Dossier: ""Inside Moonraker - An Original Documentary"" (42:00). At the end of The Spy Who Loved Me, they announced ""James Bond Will Return in For Your Eyes Only"", but they switched this to Moonraker to capitalise on the popularity of Star Wars. Hoped to coincide with the real NASA space shuttle launch, but NASA delayed it. Kept name of Hugo Drax form the book, and little else. ""We're not 'science fiction', we're in fact 'science fact'"" says Albert Broccoli vacuously. Considered using India and Nepal, but they didn't have the needed logistics (they claimed). In those days, the Concorde flew from London to Brazil in five hours. Did part of the film in France, used all the stages in Paris. Microlights. Louis Gilbert met Lois Chiles on a plane, she was cast. Jaws was hugely popular after he appeared in The Spy Who Loved Me, kids wrote to ask why he was a bad guy. Claude Renoir had to withdraw from Director of Photography as he'd lost his sight. Great Chamber was an early shot. The Mondrian set. French crews were made excited to work on weekends (outside union hours), they even brought their families on Sundays. Speedboat over falls shot is explained, and the problems that they had; finally done at Pinewood in miniature. Moonraker cost as much as the budgets of the first six Bond films combined. ""The Men Behind the Mayhem: Special Effects Documentary"" (18:05) goes from Dr No to A View To A Kill. John Stears' SFX on Dr No had a budget of 1,000 to destroy Dr Non's base. Oddjob's hat into the bars shown in reverse, meaning that it was filmed wedged into the bars and yanked out. Octopussy had every effect you could imagine. Derek Meddings died shortly after Goldeneye.

Ministry of Propaganda contains only a ""release Trailer"" (3:45), which is a collection of stunts and explosions. Seems that the film was rated R when it came out in 1979!

1398859,5,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker manages to achieve a gorgeous & lush late-70s aesthetic feel, with spectacular set design and great location shooting. While often derided with a James-Bond-In-Space sneer, the actual in-space period occupies a minor fraction of the running time and works quite well, with careful use of special effects that hold up decently even today. Without the elaborate motion-control photography rigs that Star Wars had, the crew had to compose the space scenes in-camera, with multiple photographic elements being layered onto one final take without optical compositors, where the film would run again and again through a printer. This required meticulous and unerring preparation, but the results look GREAT on Blu-Ray, with little grain and awesome clarity.  Its a gorgeous film to look at, with that slight optical fog and film grain looking so lovely, like a shiny gleam over everything.

Do all the exaggerated comedic elements (such as Jaws; no fault of Richard Kiel, but rather the writing in the case of this character) work? Certainly not. They can come off feeling a bit forced at times. They must feel foreign and awkward to modern audiences which are used to dealing with unending darkness and hyper-realism in their films. These elements can come off as dated; no question there. Best to remember that this was a time of films before 7EVEN, or Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, when studio executives though that too much darkness would scare an audience away, and darkness always needed to be leavened with humor, appropriate to the story or not.

A very welcome element is the strength of the female leads that play opposite Bond. Much more than window dressing, they are crucial plot elements, and in the case of Lois Chiles wonderfully cool, intelligent and composed performance, help James save the day (and the world) in the end.

John Barrys score is pure heaven. Several cues stand out. The initial reveal of the  Drax space station from total darkness low brass soaring, both triumphant and menacing.  The pursuit of Draxs lethal globes as they plunge into the atmosphere, all tense, brooding strings and sharp snare drum. How easily this scene could have dissolved into pure near-parody, with a lesser, more frantic score and hyperactive editing but between the well-done, simple and effective visuals, the good, serious acting between the two leads and the swirling scoreit builds tension and just plain works.

Moonraker, to me, is one of the last great analog films of a particular era. It was assembled with an extraordinary degree of care by great craftsmen, with exquisite attention to detail paid to sound and set design, and to overall mood and atmosphere. Not every single piece of the whole works, when taken by itself, but the entire experience does, even decades later.",1429056000,,2801,5.06290672451193

I thought Roger Moore had finally combined his best qualities as a personality and an actor to represent James Bond in this film. His scene in the centrifuge showed his ability to bring depth to the character in a very credible way. This one scene is a standout because it equals any performance given by any of the actors that have portrayed James Bond in this series. Christopher Wood, given sole screenplay credit this time, delivered a script full of witty dialogue. The free-fall pre-credit sequence with John Barry's background score, incredible stunt work and cinematography was excellent.

When I saw this film on opening day I remembered how the whole lobby was crammed with people. As I sat during the film I remember a little boy who was sitting in front of me turn around and look at his father. ""Daddy I really like this movie."" I never forgot that. It took me about 10 years to understand what this film was really all about. The Bond films have been around for almost 40 years now.

OCTOPUSSY is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie. It seems like a throwback to the 60s style of filmmaking. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have more subtle wit interspersed. It has an overall nostalgic feel about it. The opening is excellent as we see Bond the spy infiltrate a banana republic air base. Bond escapes via a Bede Acrostar mini jet aircraft with a guided missile in hot pursuit. The score by John Barry is very good as it seems to be a transitional state to some of his best work yet to come. He scored the early scenes very well and they had that unique Bond sound that he used to bring to the earlier films. As the film progressed the score seemed to become repetitious and tedious. He did do a good job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which had that eastern block flavor similar to his score for ""The Quiller Memorandum.""

To its credit, OCTOPUSSY uses elements from the short stories ""Octopussy"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" by Ian Fleming in a sentimental throwback to earlier Bonds. ""For Your Eyes Only"" filmed just before this one, also used some of Fleming's original writings for inspiration. In that one Bond as the shark bate in-tow was taken directly from Fleming's novel ""Live and Let Die."" Louis Jourdan as Kamal, in a very underrated performance, is excellent and is one of the best villains of the series. He is Bond's counterpart nemesis. It was also good to see many of the regular cast members return for this one. Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" seemed to return to his old self prior to ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Walter Gotell as Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the Minister of Defense, Eva Reuber-Staier as Rublevitch, Jeremy Bullock as Smithers and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny all reprised their roles much more effectively and reminiscent to the style of the earlier Bonds. Robert Brown replaced Bernard Lee as the beloved ""M."" We all missed Bernard.

OCTOPUSSY goes a little over-the-top near the end having Octopussy's troupe of beautiful amazons attack Kamal's Monsoon Palace. Then the film really goes over-the-top and under-the-top as Bond crawls all over Kamal's Beechcraft Model 18 Super H18 as it dives, loops and tailspins. I don't see anything wrong with that. In all OCTOPUSSY is a good Bond film.

For some reason A VIEW TO A KILL is one Bond movie that I return to often. When I first saw A VIEW TO A KILL on its initial release I didn't know what to make of it, but I did like it. It seemed like it got its inspiration from GOLDFINGER and Ian Fleming's Bond novel MOONRAKER. However, it was like a jumble of everything thrown up in the air and played out in the order in which they landed for what would be Roger Moore's last film as James Bond. Actions just seem to turn on a dime in this film. For example: Bond is being chased down an ice-covered slope by Soviet troops in Siberia all to an exciting John Barry score. This is an excellent scene. A gattling gun mounted on a Soviet helicopter blows the ski mobile right out from under Bond. He picks himself up, grabs the runner from the ski mobile and begins to ski board down the slope this time to the musical accompaniment of the Beach Boys' ""California Girls."" What happened to John Barry's score? The scene and all its dramatic tension are destroyed, yet it seems to work much better today, almost 30 years latter.

A VIEW TO A KILL looks a bit sloppy. The stunt doubles are not always matched to Roger Moore very professionally. His hair colour seems to go from brown to straw to red. In one scene when Bond is chasing May Day through Paris in a borrowed taxi, there is one camera shot where you can see that it is definitely not Roger Moore. The fight scene where Bond and Sir Godfrey wrap up some of Zorin's guards in the warehouse has to rank at the bottom of the series. The editing couldn't even salvage it. Yet, your heart kind of went out for Roger in this one.

He didn't have a good outing in this picture and it being his last Bond film, he perhaps deserved better. But, watching A VIEW TO A KILL today, it looks like a lot of fun. It has great locations, sets, cinematography and a good cast. There were a several memorable scenes that do make this film a good one. After Bond is chased into the woods on horseback and is captured, Bond tells Zorin that there will be retaliation if they kill him. ""You amuse me Mister Bond,"" says Zorin with indifference. ""The feeling's not mutual,"" responds Bond. After that scene I was hoping that Bond would really put this fellow out of his misery. The one image that remains with me from this film is when Bond carries Stacey on his back climbing down the fire truck ladder rescuing her from the burning City Hall. As corny as that scene may have looked it hearkened back to a time in films when heroes really were heroes. Roger did a fine job during his tenure.

After Bonds have come and gone through the years A VIEW TO A KILL somehow still entertains more with each passing year. It remains one of the most underrated Bond films of them all. In many ways A VIEW TO A KILL is an end of an era. It ended on an upbeat note.",1418083200,,7185,4.480152671755725

1398884,4,B000056OCJ,"This is one of the more divisive Bond films. At the same time it's also one of the most successful. This is James Bond in outer space. Thanks to the Star Wars craze back then the producers decided to delve further into science fiction on this adventure. What it boils down to is longtime Bond fans tend to not like it as it's a far departure from Bond's terrestrial adventures. Those new to James Bond at the time (as well as sci-fi fans in general) tend to like the movie for it many of the same reasons Bond fans hate it. However you slice it Moonraker is still very much a James Bond movie. It has it's departures and it has it's quirkiness, but Bond is still Bond.

This particular spy adventure evolves around a number of Moonraker space shuttles have been stolen and agent 007 is tasked to investigate. Bond travels the globe and finds a more nefarious plot unfold the more he learns of Moonraker's manufacturer Hugo Drax of Drax Industries. From there it's off to outer space to save the world. I admit that last part sound like a stretch from spy film to space opera, but it is what it is. On the surface the story does hold its own. As evil plots are concerned this one does take the cake, and the reasoning behind it makes enough sense along with the methods of carrying it out. However below the surface little inconsistencies weaken the overall film.

First off you will have to suspend your disbelief a little bit further than you normally have to on a James Bond movie. In this reality space shuttles are not all that rare, and world governments can essentially order one built when needed. Keep in mind this movie came out a few ears before the first NASA space shuttle launch, so we are talking about a significant departure from the real world. While this isn't that big of a deal as it's part of a significant plot point any sticklers with real world continuity that have already been chomping at the bit with Bond's previous exploits will likely make this the breaking point.

Secondly Moonraker follows the common playbook found in most Bond films. Evil mastermind, notable henchmen to fight Bond, girls to seduce, cracks to wise and so forth. On this area it seems Moonraker goes a little heavy on the stereotypical side. You can almost set a checklist with this movie. Also the amount of ""funny"" moments peppered into the movie distract a bit more than entertain. In other words they aren't really funny, and do more to pull away from the story than help it. So not only is Moonraker a turn off for fans because of the sci-fi elements, but also because it's not really taken seriously by the production itself.

So that's plenty to not like, but I have to say I do enjoy this movie for a few reasons. One of course is I actually like sci-fi, and even if you have to suspend your disbelief and put aside some glaring plot holes (like a fully fueled Moonraker shuttle flying off of being piggybacked on a 747 jet and Q testing out a laser when by the end of the movie it's pretty obvious lasers are predominant). I also have to enjoy the attempt at scientific accuracy as well, again in spite of some obvious missteps like how zero-G environments don't act all that zero-G (I blame production limitations more on that) and so forth. One big plus on this film's sci-fi element is the modelwork, which looks amazing. Especially the shots of the Moonraker shuttles on the launch bay. You could swear it was a real launch center.

Moonraker also has its share of spy thriller action with Drax's agents trying to take down James Bond at about every turn. Bond uses an array of spy gadgets to get out of trouble in this film instead of any quick thinking or personal skills, but the gadgets are part of the draw on a spy film. Also Moonraker tends to do a bit more globe trotting than usually seen on a Bond film. France, Italy, Brazil, Guatemala and of course Pinewood Studios in England. So you get lots of beautiful landscapes both natural and man made to feast your eyes on.

Acting I would say is on par mostly. Michael Lonsdale as Drax felt a bit wooden, but then again it seemed to work enough for the character. Roger Moore was his normal suave and cheeky self as Bond with a dry joke and smooth talk whenever the script requires it. Richard Kiel reprises his role as Jaws in this film, and I must say I enjoyed him having a chance to do a bit of comedy (and have an actual line in the movie). The score is classic Bond, but the title song at the beginning felt pretty forgettable in my opinion.

The Blu-Ray looks really good. The globe trotting scenes really come to life with the clarity. Usually a high definition release means the scenes that used bluescreen stand out more. While it's true you can easily notice most of those it's not as glaring as I have seen in other Blu-Rays. Composite scenes that don't use bluescreen are pretty seamless. This is really the best looking release yet for the film. Audio is also a noticeable improvement. Dialog is cleaner for sure even if you can still notice some of the limitations of the original audio. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is nice sounding, but it's obvious the surround track is not original. In the action scenes it can get a bit crazy with the environmental effects, which in contrast to the dialog scenes are louder and a bit more distracting. There is also a Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo audio track that's more true to the original mix while still enjoying a much clearer sound.

This disk holds quite a bit of extra content. However none of it is new or exclusive to the Blu-Ray. Still you get a lot. Here's the list of extras:

MI6 Commentaries - Two commentary tracks. The first one has director, producers and writers together chatting about the film. Not exactly all that informative, but the banter is enjoyable for fans. Second track is Sir Roger Moore going through his illustrious career as James Bond, and is a pretty entertaining track even if it's not talking specifically about Moonraker.

Inside Moonraker (Standard def)- This is an extensive documentary funning at 42 minutes. It covers a lot including production, stunts, on location shoots, writing and visual effects. This is the kind of making-of documentary that should be expected when implying behind the scenes coverage.

007 in Rio (High Def) - This is a feature made during the Moonraker production and has interviews and movie clips. I think this was a TV promo, or at least it plays like one, to promote the movie. Not all that informative, but the interviews are neat. The disc says high definition, but the source material screams a limited video source. It may look better than the original, but real resolution is more like standard def or maybe upscaled.

Bond '79 (High Def) - Additional interviews much like the previous featurette, only these are more frank. Basically all the suspicions you had about how the movie was directed and written will pretty much be confirmed in this interview.

Ken Adam's Production Films (Standard Def) - These are home movies made by production designer Adams he did while they were going to various locations to be used for the film. A nice distraction, but nothing informative.

Learning to Freefall: Skydiving Test Footage (Standard Def) - The beginning action scene with Bond and Jaws in that skydiving duel is further elaborated here. At the time this was one of the most daring stunts done for a movie.

Sky Diving Storyboards (Standard Def) - Two minutes of footage going through the storyboards of the skydiving stunt scene.

Circus Footage (Standard Def) - Essentially two minutes of alternate footage related to Jaws freefall into a circus tent that wasn't used in the movie.

Cable Car Alternate Storyboards (Standard Def) - The original storyboards for the cable car fight scene. Interesting to see what changed from the original idea to conception.

The Men Behind the Mayhem (High Def) - This featurette showcases the special effects artists who have done several Bond films, including Monraker.

007 Mission Control - Glorified scenes menu with some other options I never tried. It all looked pretty boring to me.

Release Trailer (High Def) - High definition version of the original movie trailer.

Image Database - Standard photo gallery with images of posters, production stills, publicity shots, etc.

All in all Moonraker is a mixed bag. Longtime fans will likely pan it for all the reasons stated above, but there may be a few who appreciate those quirks. Sci-Fi fans can get a kick out of the models and final act of the film more than anything else. As a popcorn film it delivers and it delivers with a bit more depth than most action films. Just don't take it all too seriously. This is a tongue in cheek type film most of the time. If you can get past that you may enjoy the good parts.",1414454400,,8814,4.611359285258455

I thought Roger Moore had finally combined his best qualities as a personality and an actor to represent James Bond in this film. His scene in the centrifuge showed his ability to bring depth to the character in a very credible way. This one scene is a standout because it equals any performance given by any of the actors that have portrayed James Bond in this series. Christopher Wood, given sole screenplay credit this time, delivered a script full of witty dialogue. The free-fall pre-credit sequence with John Barry's background score, incredible stunt work and cinematography was excellent. With so many fine elements at their peak of perfection it was a shame that the film unraveled in so many different directions.

When I saw this film on opening day I remembered how the whole lobby was crammed with people. As I sat during the film I remember a little boy who was sitting in front of me turn around and look at his father. ""Daddy I really like this movie."" I never forgot that. It took me about 10 years to understand what this film was really all about. The Bond films have been around for almost 40 years now. I suppose with each decade another generation of Bond fans is born. Each generation takes with them the fond memories of their introduction to James Bond. Each generation savors the moment and no matter what I or anyone else says is going to erase those memories. The magic of MOONRAKER is that it contains the best to the worst, or the worst to the best, of all the elements found in the series. There is something in MOONRAKER for everyone.",1413849600,,2138,4.533678756476684

1398888,4,B000056OCJ,"The 007 franchise hits new levels of lunacy in Moonraker. Jaws essentially becomes the coyote to Bond's roadrunner during the insanity that marks the middle portion of the film. Then there's the double-taking pigeon shot during the amphibious gondola scene. Just read that last sentence again and you will realize the theater of absurdity that 007 was in by the late 70's. And although it sets up a great stunt involving a lack of a parachute, the pre-title sequence begs the Austin Powers Query: why not just shoot Bond in the head? It seems extremely non-utilitarian to parachute out of the plane and leave Bond in it to crash. Why not just throw Bond out of the plane and blithely fly on? Maybe the unnamed nemesis is hoping to cash in on some insurance money also.
That aside (and that's a LOT to put aside) the arrival of Bond at the villain's lair is good, and the death of Corinne Clery-who should have been the lead Bond Girl here-is suitably Flemingish. The scene of Bond surviving the centrifuge machine is the best in the whole movie as Moore totally nails the Bond character.
 Now skip to Bond's arrival at the launch pad and the story finally gets into some steady, serious, and pretty awesome 007 action. I even admit to being pleased with the resolution of Jaws and his Heidi-chick. Now, just leave out the gondola part and you've got a pretty good Bond movie!",1411948800,,1375,4.612244897959184

1398905,3,B000056OCJ,"Getting the right tone in a Bond film can be difficult. A little humor adds some panache, but as Moonraker shows, too much humor undercuts the suspense and thrills we want in a Bond movie and pushes the Bond franchise into camp territory. Moonraker's abrupt juxtapositions of action sequences and goofy humor can be jarring, as when Jaws fights 007 on a tram that crashes into the station. We then see Jaws, cartoon-like, sitting on the ground with a large metal wheel around his neck that despite his superhuman strength he cannot push away until a diminutive pig-tailed woman Dolly shows up and helps him. They look at each other and as Jaws smiles his metallic grin, they instantly fall in love to the sounds of Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliette Overture-Fantasy, which swells satirically in the background. Moonraker is full of weird moments like this, including the opening where Jaws survives a free fall from an airplane by flapping his arms like a bird to aim to land on a circus tent. That's an unfortunate decision by the director, because it undermines the brilliant stunt sequence that preceded it.

This movie obviously has Star Wars on its mind, right down to the sound effects of the lasers that inexplicably are mounted on he front of the American space shuttles. Otherwise, the movie adheres to the Bond formula that was stale by this time: Megolomaniac bad guy with crazy plans for world domination, Bond girls, etc. On the plus side, Moore had settled into the role comfortably by this time, but otherwise the Bond franchise needed freshening.",1391644800,,1561,4.868421052631579

1398909,3,B000056OCJ,"Not bad.  It's a good fast-paced action Bond movie, and I was especially interested in it since it's set partly in space.  The rehabilitation of the Jaws character seems contrived and not very realistic (what, he's a good guy now? previous murders forgiven? what does he do for a living now? etc.), but it was ok in context.

However, the substantial inaccuracies of the movie have cost it a star in my book.  You can't fly space shuttles around like aircraft (though this might not have been common knowledge in 1979).  More significantly, a shuttle's main engines don't run without fuel from the external tank, and the shuttle at the start of the movie was attached to a 747 instead of a fuel tank--so the entire premise of the hijacking was invalidated right from the get-go.  (And who would transport a fully fueled shuttle across the Atlantic anyway?)

Jaws bites through a gondola cable--and does it easily, as if he were chomping through a carrot or something!  I don't care what his teeth are like, no human being has jaw muscles strong enough to cut through over an inch of steel.  You couldn't do it with both arms and an oversized set of bolt cutters--it's simply ludicrous to have him use his mouth to do that job, just to show how impressive his teeth are.

Also, the centrifuge is messed up.  A centrifuge works on centrifugal force (as you'd expect from its name), so the seat faces toward the center--but in the movie it's shown facing sideways.  Seated like that, as it accelerated Bond should have been forced hard against the left side, not backward into his seat.  Given that this machine apparently laughs at the laws of physics, Bond probably wasn't in real danger during that assassination attempt--so how seriously am I supposed to take the others?  Basically, good premise, bad execution.  3 stars.",1389657600,,1823,4.742857142857143
1398910,1,B000056OCJ,This was just a really bad movie.  Didn't even finish it but pulled the plug on the dvd player.  It was so far below the quality of the Bond franchise movies that would make Ian Flemming cry.  It made me cry that I spent $ on it.,1389484800,,229,3.8297872340425534
1398911,4,B000056OCJ,"This was the first James Bond adventure produced after the success of STAR WARS, so it jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon by combining the suave appeal of Agent 007 (once again played by British Roger Moore) with enough high-tech hardware and special-effects to make Luke Skywalker want to join Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the razzle-dazzle of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office.

This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured NASA scientist Dr. Holly Goodhead(played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin).

There's a grand-scale climax involving space shuttles and ray guns, but despite the film's popular success, this is one Bond adventure that never quite gets off the launching pad. It's as if the caretakers of the James Bond franchise had forgotten that it's Bond--and not a barrage of gizmos and gadgets (including a land-worthy Venetian gondola)--that fuels the series' success. Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as ""like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension""), MOONRAKER had no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites.

MOONRAKER also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 6 going on 7 years old and saw it in the movies for the very first time back in the Summer of 1979 before it was shown on HBO for the very first time in January of 1981.",1389139200,,1866,4.936305732484076

1398928,3,B000056OCJ,"This the 11th Bond film and the 4th with Roger Moore as 007 is a pretty average affair although some of the special effects and sets are pretty spectacular.  Moore manages to wear a suit or sport coat and tie with great style.  His fighting skills are pretty abysmal in contrast.  So here's the deal.

A multi-billionaire named Hugo Drax (darn good Michael Lonsdale as the villain) is the builder of the space shuttle used by NASA.  When one disappears on a flight to England (on loan from the Americans), Bond must find out what happened to it.  This leads him to California where the craft is built, then to Italy, Brazil, France and other great spots where Drax also has operations.

After an hour or so of the usual Bond on girl and Bond on bad guy routine we get to the rationale for all of Drax's efforts.  He has developed a gas that will kill all humans, but will have no effect on animals or plant life.  He plans to shoot the stuff at Earth from a space station that is invisible to radar.  He will load attractive human couples onto 6 space shuttles and dock them at the station while the rest of the human race will be extinguished.  They all return, have kiddies and pay allegiance to the all mighty Drax.

This might all work except for Bond and his new buddy and NASA spy, Dr. Holly Goodhead, played by the always nice to look at, Lois Chiles.  Jaws (Richard Kiel) returns as a Drax thug but turns against him when he realizes that he and his new girlfriend (Blanche Ravalec) don't quite fit the bill as perfect specimens of humans.  ""Moonraker"" should satisfy many Bond fans, especially those who prefer more comedy than action.  As it is, this is clearly one of the lesser Bond films.  Still, it looks good and so do the ladies.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is certainly a step up from even the best of the DVD versions.  It looks clean throughout and has excellent clarity and depth.  Colors and black levels are also excellent.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is very good with well directed dialog, but with minimal use of the surrounds.  I suspect the transfer is hampered by the audio technology of the era.  The extras are plentiful.  Some may find them more entertaining than the film itself.  Here's a list:

1398932,4,B000056OCJ,"The 11th James Bond film was supposed to be For Yours Eyes Only but with the news of the Americans launching their first space shuttle, Albert Broccoli (now the single film producer) and his team decided to make Moonraker their next Bond film.  With science fiction all the rage, the producer and screenwriters gleaned a story from Ian Fleming's novel of the same name.  The villain remained but the story changed with the introduction of an outer space threat agaiist the earth.

The film, Moonraker opens with the midair heist of a shuttle, the moonraker from the back of a jumbo jet and an inventive and unnerving sequence featuring Bond being pushed out of a plane by Jaws.  He saves himself by stealing the parachute from the pilot.  The film itself featured more 'in-house' jokes, more camera smirks by Roger Moore, and the use of musical themes from other movies (Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Magnificent Seven) - a ploy not appreciated by many traditional Bond fans. In this film, James Bond (Roger Moore) is called in by M and is issued a wrist mounted dart gun/watch by Q and is assigned to clear the British of the shame for losing the loaned moonraker.  He begins his search at the Drax corporation HQ in California, where the shuttle is made.  While there, he meets Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), surely possessing the most sexually explicit name; a pilot, Corinne Dufour (Corinne Clery)"" Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale); Chang (Toshiro Suga) - a real life black-belt judo master (a nod to Henry Sakata/Mr. Oddjob); and the first of several pairs of beauties who are part of Drax's plan.  Bond romances the doomed Ms. Dufour into helping him uncover some of Drax' secrets - she meets her end at the jaws of hunting dogs. Bond survives the first assassination attempt by a hidden gunman.  Convinced that Drax is up to something, Bond follows a lead based on some blueprints of a glass container to Venice, Italy, the site of one of Drax's many companies.  In Venice, he discovers one of Drax secret labs where nerve gas is being developed and encased in glass tubes and a mechanical carrier.  He steals one vile and causes the death of several scientists. Trying to leave, Bond battles Chang before throwing him to his death.  Drax calls in Jaws (who was saved by producers due to his huge popularity and request to soften his character).  Bond and Goodhead run into each other and unite their investigation once Bond figures out that she is a CIA plant by pointing out her CIA-issue equipment - this scene is silly. The two separately head off to Brazil where many of the crates from Drax' glass company.  The two survive an eye-popping murder attempt by Jaws on cable-cars suspended 2,000 feet above the ground - which Jaws survives and is rescued by Dolly, a tiny, freckled pig-tailed blonde. Escaping this and another death attempt, Bond ends up riding a horse across the pampas to the Monastery of San Nicolo the location of another MI-6 HQ and another Q laboratory.  Bond meets Q who tells him that the poison from the stolen vile comes from - an orchid that grows in a desolate area of the jungle river basin.  Bond is also issued a speed boat equipped with a built-in glider.  Of course, while cruising the Amazon, he is pursued by several speedboats and Jaws but escapes over the falls by way of his glider.  Bond lands and finds Drax's hidden hideout and HQ.  Drax unveils his plan to destroy all humanity by way of the re-engineered and now-fatal nerve toxin and then re-populate it with his hand-picked and perfect specimens whom Bond has met.  Drax and his crews take off on board six moonrakers to his cloaked space station without realizing that Bond and Good head have snuck on board.  The two foil Drax plans with the help of Jaws once he realizes that he and Dolly have no place in Drax perfect specimen world. The end battle in space between American soldiers and Drax' army is very well-made.  Of course, Drax space station is destroyed and Bond saves the day and the earth.  the film ends with another patented sex-themed scene (with Holly Goodhead).

The film proved to be the most successful Bond at that point but was not on par with The Spy Who Loved Me.  The Ken Adam sets and stunts stole the movie and Roger Moore brought his own style to the role which was now firmly his.

Side note: The Drax lab seen in this film follows in the tradition of many other labs featured in many Bond films (Goldfinger, Diamonds Are Forever, Live And Let Die, and Man With the Golden Gun).

1398936,5,B000056OCJ,"I saw Moonraker in 1979 on HBO. Yes it is over the top. Yes they were trying to cash in on Star Wars (who wasn't?) But to my 12 year old eyes, it was bliss.

What's not to love? First you've got Roger Moore, in that classic gun pose in a space suit. Add to this hot chicks in space, 'Lazers,' Jaws floating in space. A hot chick scientist hanging off his leg, named Dr. Holly Goodhead. That's right, Goodhead. You can't make this up, but someone did and they were probably laughing themselves silly when they did.

It also has what has to be probably the best Roger Moore double entendre in the entire series;

As bond and Dr. Goodhead are having sex in zero gravity the Prime minister says, ""What is Bond doing?"", Q, who is looking at a monitor says, ""He's attempting re-entry sir!""

Cut to a space shuttle flying off to a disco beat and you've got one heck of a movie!

You can't make this stuff up, but someone did.

And we're all better off for it.

It was the most successful Bond film in the series up to that point.

It was the 70s. You had to be there.

1398939,5,B000056OCJ,"I have seen Moonraker several times over the years, and always feel it is excellent as a Bond movie. The movie gives me a sense of nostalgia for the cars and objects I remember from many years ago when I was a kid. You don't see that style of Ford trucks any more -- and notice that Bond films over the years seem to focus on Ford vehicles if they are filmed partly in the United States. It is useful to study how the sets are constructed and what furnishings are provided. It brings back a bygone era, and often, that can make up for other things that a movie is missing.

This movie has no subtlety at all. We are quickly shown that Drax is indeed a villain within a minute or so of seeing him. From then on, it is very clearly Drax vs. Bond: evil and good, black and white, Death and Life. Of all the Bond movies, the scene in which dogs are unleashed upon one of Drax's employees is one so brutal I can't bear to watch it. I'm bothered by how Richard Kiel (Jaws) is used in the film, the role feels a little like he is being insulted by using his height and great strength to cast him as a freak of nature. However it is also a role where Jaws experiences love and begins a transformation. We can wish them both a happy ending to their adventure.

It is hard for me to judge Roger Moore as a Bond. I like his keep calm and carry on Eton approach. He is a very good Bond. We see him thinking about what he is doing, even though it is remarkably easy for him to add 2 and 2. We see him loving the girls and fighting the bad guys, which is to be expected. (He seems to endure hand to hand combat with boku-wielding ninjas better than he did in ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" against trainees who had only their fists, but that is another miracle story.) As 007, he succeeds against his villains effortlessly, and that is hard for viewers to accept. There is no doubt in my mind that the two best Bond actors are Daniel Craig and Pierce Brosnan. Both have an explosive power and immersion into their roles that is authentic to viewers. Where Moore doesn't get so much as a chipped fingernail, Craig is often wounded and at least once tortured. We see he same things happen to Brosnan, again with authenticity. Connery experiences wounds and torture as well, but with less authenticity than Craig and Brosnan can convey. Moore goes on without a scratch, Craig and Brosnan and Connery bleed and go on, and are therefore more interesting. But note, they make stunningly rapid recoveries from wounds and torture.

In Moonraker, most of the scenes lack real authenticity. It is hard for the viewer to believe Bond's ability to survive and then destroy Drax despite all the obstacles. Drax's villainy is cleverly played, and it carries authenticity; his attempts to kill Bond should have worked. We can believe Drax: we can't really believe Bond. For instance, why would a space shuttle need an air shaft under the launching pad? It seems such a good way to destroy the launching facility.

Even so, I give this movie 5 stars. I love watching it. I love seeing the old Ford trucks and 1960s/1970s buildings. That's a '5'!",1370563200,,3114,4.363793103448276

1398942,1,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker, Moonraker, Moonraker. Why oh why did James Bond go into space? When I was a kid I was a Star Wars nut, still am and back then a bloke in a tuxedo battling bad guys in space was the movie to see. Even though I had never seen  any James Bond until that time, it seemed awesome.. Unlike Star Wars , the childhood fondness and fascination disappeared upon growing up and seeing this entry alongside the other Bond films.

The fourth Moore outing is a souless, overblown, gadget ridden action film, moving from one over the top set piece to another, changing exotic locales each time. Sailing dangerously close to being a camp parody of itself with Roger Moore near to winking at the audience at certain points.

It has it's good points though Michael Lonsdale  plays it absolutely straight and sinister as main villain Drax, despite the absurdity of the plot which is basically a re-hash of the Spy Who Loved Me - e.g. madmen attempts to wipe out all humans except for the superior ones he has chosen for re-creating in his home built Utopia replacing an undersea city with a satellite. Lois Chiles turns in a great performance as Dr. Goodhead, a ludicrously named but kick-ass CIA agent who endures the most sexist line ever in a Bond film ""...a woman?"" The last good point is the return of metal teethed henchman Jaws but it's a shame he's played for laughs this time round. It's also the last appearance of Bernard Lee as the original, crusty, 'M'.

Bad points, some already mentioned, are Jaws falling in love, a rubber snake, an enemy space station that no defense system can detect even in the 1970's (?), laser battles and space shuttle chases in space to cash in on the popularity of Star Wars...the electronic gondolier...and many more camp moments. Also the third and most lackluster of Shirley Bassey's Bond songs - she was only given a couple of weeks to record it when a couple of other artists dropped out...

Least the disc is better on this edition, the picture transfer is digitally as clean as a whistle and has none of the graininess that as past editions have shown making look more modern, except of course for the fashions -ugh!
A good documentary abound on this ultimate edition - highlighting hown popular Bond was by the end of the 1970's. Like all 1970's Bond movies it has excellently had an excellent surround sound upgrade, you can almost hear Moore's eyebrow raise...

1398949,4,B000056OCJ,"""Moonraker"" for me has always been the best of the Roger Moore Bond outings. For years the single DVD was hard to find, at least at a price beneath $25 or so. I was thrilled when, last fall, apparently as part of the Bond movies 50th anniversary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moonraker/dp/B000NIBURG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moonraker</a>&nbsp;appeared. Bond movies are like ""Godfather"" movies, every year or so they come out in repackaged box sets, New! Improved! Whiter! and Brighter! than ever before, hoping to get fans to shell out even more money for movies they've already purchased countless times in countless formats. This edition of ""Moonraker"", I'm happy to report, offers high quality sight and sound, and features several bonus features, including commentary from cast and crew. Note , however, the picture of the front that appears on Amazon differs from the actual DVD package.

I know that my preference for ""Moonraker"" over ""Spy Who Loved Me"" puts me in a minority of 007 fans (one that doesn't include Roger Moore). While ""Spy"" has several first-rate set pieces and arguably the best pre-title sequence of all Bond movies, for me ""Spy"" suffers from draggy pacing, usually by the time Bond is rescuing the sailors from Karl Stromberg's underwater fortress I find myself nodding off.

In ""Moonraker,"" on the other hand, director Lewis Gilbert keeps the story moving at a crisp pace, and the actors, for the most part, play their roles relatively straight. Moore has yet to descend into his cynical, play-Bond-for-laughs acting method. Richard Kiel as ""Jaws"" steals every scene he's in. Michael Lonsdale, as the villain Hugo Drax, displays a dry wit and quiet intensity that hints at the volcanic inner life of a mega maniac ready to annihilate the world's population and start a new master race.  Bernard Lee, in his final appearance, as M, and the rest of the Bond regulars appear.  The only real weak link is Lois  Chiles as CIA agent/NASA scientist Lois Chiles delivers line readings for the most part in a sleepwalking monotone.

""Moonraker"" opens with a familiar 007 plot device, the theft of a major piece of military industrial hardware, in this case, a space shuttle. Bond is dispatched to get it back, and the story takes him from southern California to Venice to Rio and the Amazon jungle, before climaxing in Drax's space station. Highlights include Bond trapped in a G-force training vehicle, a motorized gondola chase through the canals of Venice, a knock-down brawl with a Ninja assassin in a glass museum, a chase and fight with ""Jaws"" on a cable car, a boat chase on the Amazon, and the final battle in outer space. The film's strengths include an imaginative pre-title sequence in which Bond is tossed out of a plane without a parachute (featuring stunt work that has come to be widely imitated in action movies), a snazzy John Barry score, with Shirley Bassey performing the title song (A Shirley Bassey vocal is always a sign you're in for a treat), and a gag involving a secret gas warfare lab that delivers one of the biggest laughs in any Bond film (I can still recall the roar of laughter in the theater I saw it in originally).

""Moonraker"" has received a great deal of criticism over the years, especially for its outer space sequence. Many see it as a rip-off of ""Star Wars."" Yes, the producers were trying to cash in on the ""Star Wars"" craze, just as they cashed in on the ""blaxplotation"" and martial arts film crazes of the 1970s with ""Live and Let Die"" and ""The Man With the Golden Gun."" And let's face it, by 1979 the stories had pretty much exhausted the impregnable fortress ideas, having placed them everywhere from under the ocean to the top of the Swiss Alps. After ""Spy"" they literally had nowhere  else to go but up.

Of course, once you've sent your hero into space it can be hard to top, and after ""Moonraker"" the Bond movies really didn't try. The filmmakers dialed the stakes and special effects back  considerably in ""For Your Eyes Only,"" but only proved that, for Bond, there was no going back. The Bond films deteriorated into dispiriting exercises in the mechanics of franchise moviemaking. With the Pierce Brosnan films the franchise regained some creative and commercial vitality, but it's only been in the past six years, with the ""rebooted"" Bond played by Daniel Craig, that the Bond filmmakers have been able to recapture the original magic of Bond as more of a flesh and blood character than larger-than-life cartoon, in stories that push the boundaries of plausibility without falling over into being utterly preposterous.

The 1970s 007 films, long derided by fans and critics alike, may be in line for a critical re-appraisal. Sam Mendes and Craig have remarked how one of their biggest inspirations for ""Skyfall,"" the most commercially and critically successful Bond movie of them all, was the Bond films they saw in their movie-going youth in the 70s, such as ""Live and Let Die."" That marriage of 70s-pop culture sensibility and 21st century film technology, along with a world view shaped by the tumultuous events of the past 12 years,  should help insure Bond is around for the next 50 years. ""Moonraker"" is no great work of art, but it is first-rate escapist entertainment and futuristic, in more ways than one.",1365206400,,5335,4.948603351955307

If you like the movie, get it. This is a 4/5 for the Blu-Ray and a 7/10 for the film itself.  On to the review...

Of all the James Bond movies, Moonraker seems to elicit the quickest negative opinions in conversation. The producers, admittedly, attempted to capitalize on the sci-fi bandwagon of the late 70s taking major liberties with the original story and rocketing James bond to space. On the cover of it all, indeed even the movie poster itself, this is a laughable scenario. But in practice, I'm not sure it's actually enough to doom this Bond outing. In my opinion, Moonraker is far from the worst Bond movie, and actually quite enjoyable.

All Bond movies are a product of their time. All these movies are a great reflection and pulse of their respective contemporary popular culture. So while today it is easy to say Moonraker is a cheesy forgettable Bond movie, I'd say you never saw Live and Let Die or Octopussy. Essentially, you've already seen Moonraker. Just like The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker is yet another re- working of You Only LIve Twice which was really just reworked from Thunderball. A water/space craft is stolen and taken to an underwater/outer space fortress to wreak havoc on the free world. That's pretty much it.

So you think Moonraker is cheesy? Space Shuttle cheesy? Did nobody actually watch Goldfinger and the laser beams, razor Odd Job hat, or Thunderball jet pack? Jaws is a good guy cheesy? Well Lois Chiles' ""Goodhead"" is pretty laughable, but runner up to the raciest double entendre after Pussy Galore. There are no stupid poison tipped knife shoes. Bond does not build a helicopter from a briefcase or dress up as a clown. Moonraker is definitely riding the coattails of the near perfect success of The Spy Who Loved Me, one of the top two Bond movies ever in my book, and it's a great piece of entertainment with a nice, if nonsensical, title song.

There is no perfect or reference Bond film. They are all just escapist entertainment with flaws keenly visible on any repeated viewings. Many people want to point to Goldfinger as the, er, gold standard, but it's cheesy as heck in every way. While Connery is easily the best 007, I think On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me and Goldeneye are the actual movie benchmarks. But don't fool yourself thinking Bond is anything more than a two hour fantasy. Even the really bad ones like Die Another Day, License to Kill or Live and LEt Die are watchable. Moonraker fits nicely in the middle. Don't be a snob, Moonraker isn't a comment on the human condition but it's fun and entertaining in a way the dour and stale Skyfall isn't. Cut it some slack. Space Camp from 1986 is much worse than this.",1353456000,,2934,4.641618497109826

1398976,5,B000056OCJ,"During the late 70s, Space movies were a big hit so not to be outdone, MGM decided to send James Bond where he has never been before....space.

The original Moonraker novel is about intercontinental missles but the movie adapation ditches the missles for space shuttles. After a space shuttle is stolen from a 747, James Bond is sent to investigate its disappearance and travels to America, Italy, Brazil and finally space. He also uses a laser gun that is never seen in the series again but it was during the Star Wars craze so it is forgiveable.

The blu ray has a good transfer and the details do stand out, you can see the shine on Jaws' metal teeth and the final battle in space is nice, good sound and hip 70s soundtrack, it is amazing to see all the sights and product placements (7up) and while the movie can be dated at times, it is still fun and Roger Moore's swagger plays out well during the film.

1398977,2,B000056OCJ,"Every time I watch Moonraker I always wonder who the studio's targeted demographic was- Star Wars fans of Bond fans. There is no other Bond film with more over-the-top special effects or overuse of special effects. The plot itself has only passing resemblance to the book of the same name. The movie is fun, don't get me wrong, but it is the weakest link in the entire Bond series in my opinion.

  I will forego nitpicking the little things and focus on the main two issues I mentioned above. First of all, let's compare the plot.

  The basic plots of the movie and the book share very little resemblance. In the book, the main villain, Hugo Drax, is a former German special forces commander who pretends to have been a British soldier suffering from amnesia. He is working on an upgraded V2 rocket capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The catch is that he intends to destroy London with it, not sell it to the British government.

  In the movie, Drax's background is not really discussed at all but he lives in America instead of Britain and has built a fleet of what look exactly like NASA's space shuttles. Instead of destroying London, he wants to destroy all of humanity and repopulate the world with the offspring of his select-chosen super humans in efforts to create a super race. Indeed, these ""super humans"" live on a space station orbiting the Earth.

  Drax, who as you can see is so very different from the book, even has a henchman named Jaws who never appeared in the book. However, in the studio's defense, a henchman named Horror who resembled Jaws did appear in the book The Spy Who Loved Me, the movie of which Jaws was also in.

  Additionally, Hugo Drax has another bizarre henchman named Chang who appears to be a modern-day samurai despite apparently being Chinese. I have to point out that Samurai are Japanese, not Chinese. The martial arts of the two countries are very, very different. I'll stop there. As you can see though, the movie and book are similar in name only and leagues apart on the believability scale.

  The special effects are the other thing that weakened this movie for me. I will not spend much time here but suffice it to say, the overuse of space shuttle-like space ships and the abundance of laser weapons was over the top. Everyone seemed to have a laser gun. Hokier yet, Drax had five shuttles if I am not badly mistaken and even the U.S. Marine Corps had one. It was silly to say the least.

  I realize this movie came out in the wake of Star Wars and no doubt the studio wanted to cash in on the sci-fi audience. Still, they pushed this movie not only far beyond the book but way beyond being anything like a normal Bond adventure. It is fun to watch, especially if you have never read the book, but is silly to the point almost of being a comedy at times. For all the above, I give it two stars. One is for the fact that despite all the bizarre differences from the book, the movie is still fun escapism. I give it the other star for the once-again amazing Blu-ray transfer. I recommend this only for the most staunch-Bond fans or for anyone who is just a sucker for anything sci-fi.",1343606400,,3142,4.47719298245614

1398979,4,B000056OCJ,"I first saw the movie just after NASA dropped out of Space Shuttle program. 11th James Bond movie released in 1979 vividly introduced to the world how the near future NASA space programs would be like as we have witnessed that what the movie showed was exactly how the space shuttle programs basically are except that the programs were not used for annihilation of human race. Production team did it excellently because the actual takeoff scene of the Space Shuttle Columbia two years after the movie was exactly like how the movie depicted.

The movie overall stressed comical side of the bond film. Particularly how the Villain Jaws was characterized in his second appearance of the bond film aptly exemplifies this. In previous movie The Spy Who Loved Me, Jaws was portrayed as cold-blooded invincible villain. In this film Jaws  ' invincibility stayed the same but with more comical side of his appeal such as how he came along in the Rio Carnival scene. And he even falls in  love with the girl! Personally I hoped Jaws stayed bad character until the end just as previous film.

In the movie You Live Only Twice the production team excellently introduced both current and traditional sides of Japan. But on this movie Japan was not treated well. It's nice the Chang wore Kendo costume but Chang was set as Chinese character not Japanese. Just as previous film the production team might have confused idea on the difference between Chinese and Japanese culture.

Verdict: Enjoyable but Still Bond is Earthbound.

1398980,4,B000056OCJ,"I rate The Spy Who Loved Me as Roger Moore's best Bond outing, but Moonraker was a worthy follow-up.  Watching it now, the thrills of the sci-fi 70s haven't dated as badly as one might expect.  In fact, what the production team manages to achieve with the Space Shuttle launch into space is quite astonishing in terms of realism.

The highlight of the 2 DVD set (which does come with a lot of padding) is the 2000 documentary on the making of Moonraker - a worthy interview with the men who made Bond's stunts and special effects happen.  Production Designer Ken Adam's set was quite rightly the star of Moonraker, and the sheer scale of Bond films makes one marvel and appreciate when special fx entailed real creativity and labor - 96 exposures on a single negative.  The definition ""Computer Generated Imagery"" didn't exist yet!  For their efforts, the team was nominated for an Academy Award.

Roger Moore is consistent as ever.  The jokes are a little hokier on this outing and some moments are plain silly, but why take it all so seriously was always the filmmakers' attitude, and Roger Moore always pulled it off with panache.  Moonraker has been lambasted for taking Bond into a less ""serious"" mode but at least it has the Bond fantasy elements that entertained audiences convincingly. The sense of scale that Bond films achieved would seem contrived and strained today if attempted by other movie franchises, but the Bond team always made it seem like an effortless jaunt.  Bond was still the best of the best, with no imitations.

For those who want a super serious unsmiling Bond, there are plenty of other Bond films or books to peruse.  But Moonraker is about having fun - Bond style.",1334361600,,1697,4.715254237288136
1398981,1,B000056OCJ,"It's taken some years for me to warm up to this film, but it's become one of the Moore Bond films that I'll go back to quite a bit more than the ones that proceed it (with the possible exception of FYEO).  It has plenty of ridiculous moments, but it is overall pleasing to my person.

Seeing as this review is about the PRODUCT and not the MOVIE ITSELF, 1 star is more than appropriate considering the HORRENDOUSLY-made DVD I have in my collection.  I purchased the disc second hand a few years back and it's absolutely scratch-free (on both sides) but it doesn't work AT ALL.

I'm sure if I had typed this review back in 1998-2000 I'd have a much higher opinion of the disc, but now that the ""laser rot"" has reared its ugly head it's completely useless!  I just hope that the companies that manufactured these discs (and all of the other CDs, DVDs and the Laserdiscs of yesteryear out there that are now coasters of varying sizes) have changed their fabrication practices for modern disc formats or have completely gone under.

1398983,5,B000056OCJ,"""Moonraker"" is the 11th James Bond film and the fourth to star Roger Moore. Although a huge box office hit making over $200,000,000, the movie is seen by most Bond enthusiasts as one of the worst in the franchise. This is mainly due to the ridiculous script that made no sense what so ever. Despite the efforts of a wonderful cast, a campy villin, and beautiful exotic locales, the movie just didn't jell with film goers. The plot deals with a maniac's attempt to rule the world by killing the earth's population by a space station.

 The film is also known for it's hugely expensive budget. Still, if your a huge Bond fan like me you must include this in your collection.",1318636800,,672,4.5
1398992,4,B000056OCJ,"OK So this is one of my faverite bond films.

Whats good about it:
1. I personally like how the film feels like it was filmed in the 60's... or another goldfinger... like a gold finger part 2... or something
2. Chick gets eaten by dogs
3. James bond shoots a man in a tree.
4. He makes out with that one chick at the beginning after exchanging a paragraph worth of words.
5. Hover craft chase in venice
6. Jaws.
7. Boat chase scene with the 'classic' 007 song
8. Space fight.
9. Killer sound track
10. Hot chicks
11. Hugo Drax
12. Multicultural

Whats bad about it.

1. they land on a circus tent... so that part is pretty stupid. equally as stupid as when the car does the flip in man with the golden gun, and there's that stupid whistle in the background... the editors must have been smoking too much pot and had just finished watching cheech and chong.
2. When he makes out with that chick at the beginning, except that part was so bad its good so it actually doesn't belong on this list.
3. Stupid intro and exit songs. the exit song would have been cool had it been an instrumental
4. Jaws- yeah Jaws is cool its just like.. Jaws is also kind of  stupid. Also... which Jaws fight scene sticks out in everybody's psyche as the epitome of all Jaws fight Scene's?.... Of course the one on the train in the spy who loved me... First bond forcefully pushes a Russian Spy inside a folding... train... bed...? and then takes jaws on.. one on one... So he could have suffocated a Russian spy who apparently loved him or so says the deceiving title. So bond thinks oh i can take on this invincible bad man who can eat bullets. so he pushes the bed into the wall which contains a woman who is trained as a spy for the Russian government. so bond is thinking that he would be better off if he fights mister metal teeth by himself because a woman who is a spy would just get in the way... take that feminism. any who so he is being choked by metal teeth man and James is thinking to himself... oh god what am i going to do. i just stuffed a Russian woman between a wall and a bed and now i am being strangled by a man who is invincible with metal teeth. what could possibly be his weakness... oh i know metal teeth Pokemon are week against electricity. instead of hitting him over the head with that near by lamp... i will first break the bulb in it first thus breaking a link in the circuit. once the circuit has been broken, i will use the metal on this man's teeth here to complete the circuit. judging by the poor dental hygiene of this man has i would imagine that his gumms aren't strong enough of a ground to handle all that power... so by  placing this here broken light bulb will... if you will... leave a ""shocking"" after taste....that is what james bond was thinking while being choked by Jaws.
5. Jaws Girl friend- easily the worst part of the movie. They both even some how make it into space. So Jaws and Mary Hartman are making out in a space ship and don't make their appearance toward the end .. holding hands...how did those people get back to earth any who. did the secret service find the control room on earth and hire their own space people from the British space control room to come over to drax's control room. or did they just pay the people who were already manning the control boards do it, and then take them to jail after they were finished. Or did they contract the Americans to do it because the British didn't have people working in a control room. Or was the ship on auto pilot because the people on earth would have been dead had the mission gone through as planned. Also why did the women on the ship agree to do it. and what is money's value if only 9 people can use it. another thing... he would have created a future with only one race because the offspring of the pretty people of each race would have to have sex with a member of a different race because having sex with a person of your same race would mean that you were having sex with your brother and or sister. also where would you bring the women when the babies were popping out. a hospital? with nobody running it?  so the women basically signed a contract that said that they were willing to become pregnant in a apocalyptic world where there was only 10-15 in habitats, and if they got a yeast infection you would have to just deal with it cos there aren't any doctors around. You also couldn't listen to any new music because your favorite musicians would be dead and you couldn't watch t.v. and if you did want to watch t.v. you would have to wait until your collective of 10-15 people produced enough off-spring to relearn how to operate this old technology. on top of that, you wouldn't have any electricity. so first you would have to make enough babies to understand how to generate power, and then make enough babies to operate cable television. This is why Jaw's girl friend sucks.
6. The space scene-This scene is awesome but it has nothing to do with anything and its like 20 minutes long and nobody talks until the end so it's kinda like 2001: a space movie in a way... on the grounds that no one talks in it.

so as you can see there are way more awesome things in this movie than lame things... like a total of 12 cool things and 6 lame things... so it is apparently 50% more cool than it is lame... so anybody who thought this movie sucked... which it clearly didn't... apparently didn't take the time to weigh out the good and bad aspects. If you were looking for a film to make fun of... it should have been... a view to a kill sucked... but even then, it had enough cool action scenes to fill up two hours of your day...ok im done now",1292544000,,5647,4.252327746741154

1398996,1,B000056OCJ,"Fantastical adventures across Venice, The Brazillian Rainforest, and even Space!  This is like Close Encounters, The Time Machine and Star wars all wrapped in one.  You get it all!  The plot is no less entertaining, the villain is nefarious and twisted, the gadgets do their job, and as usual there are girls a plenty.  The problem with this film, is the obvious pretension the filmmakers had in out-doing the previous Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me.  How could we possibly take Bond to the next level?  All of elements are fine, but are inherently flawed, which in the end makes the whole FAR FAR worse than the sum of it's halfway decent parts.  There are plenty of great action scenes--but there are WAY too many.  The entire plot is James seeking out the mystery of Drax's operation, but being stopped by a gondola assassin here, a boat chase there...Maybe as a saturday morning cartoon or a video games this works, but c'mon, even Bond has standards...

I can't even go on...basically this movie is ridiculous.  You have Jaws flapping his wings to circus music in the opening scene, James Bond riding a hover craft gondola through Venice--while a pigeon--A PIGEON!!! does a double-take, then there is Bond wrestling an albino python deep in the Brazilian rainforest and to cap it off a horrible laser battle climax that looks like they borrowed graphics from an Atari 2600 game.  Even James Bond in his own movie can't help holding back the disbelief: ""Moneypenny I was being chased by a ski lift...aw nevermind.""  Watch this movie for the one-liners...that's about it...or maybe the breathtaking views of Rio de Jeneiro.  The great tragedy, is the fact that this movie could have been very good!  The story premise is interesting.  However, they introduce the villain too early on, and from there it becomes a giant chase scene to kill Bond.  Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead has some of the worst acting in the whole series.  Sure, the 'hot' models in the 60's films weren't great, but at least they didn't seem like they were reciting lines for their high school play.

1398997,2,B000056OCJ,"This ain't the worst Bond, but it's very close. Moonraker looks great in blu-ray, but as the saying goes, you can polish a turd but it'll still be crap.

Having seen every Bond film many times, some of them many dozens, I feel confident in saying, this one sucks. It was great the week it came out and I was a kid in the thrall of all things Star Wars-ish, but that's who this film was made for: pre-teens who have never read a Fleming Bond book and don't understand what this character is meant to be.

Here, Bond is pure cartoon. Other reviewers feel this is better than Live And Let Die and Golden Gun, but I say, not even close. Those two are campy but fun; this one is merely campy and stupid. Terrible script, jokes so bad they're not even wryly funny, and on. I hadn't seen this one since the 80s and realized why: it is indeed not worth watching except for Bond completists. The scenery here is lovely in blu-ray, but I can watch travel shows in HD if that's all I want.

Moore is obviously bored and as bad a Bond here as Brosnan ever was, maybe worse. But what to expect from a film that was, according to the producers (on the decent extras doc, the only worthwhile thing here), a complete Star Wars exploitation flick? Nothing, and that's what we get.

I'd watch the first five Bond films a dozen times each before I'd get bored enough to watch ten minutes of this, and then only the first ten, as they're the only remotely decent thing here.

I love Bond films when they're smart and fun; Moonraker is neither, and blu-ray in some ways only highlights how cheesy this movie really is.",1260057600,,1597,4.31

The gadgets weren't that great, the music was not the best and the plot was even more over the top than usual.  I am also not the biggest fan of Roger Moore's interpretation of Bond and his psyche.  He is much more comical and soft than the Bonds before and after him.  The Blu-Ray is a nice clean up of the picture, but there is only so much that can be done with the older movies before the special effects work becomes obvious.  The soundtrack is probably the most improved aspect of this movie vs. the DVD.  The color and contrast of the film is also greatly improved vs the DVD.",1258070400,,671,4.1875
1398999,5,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker is actually the first Moore 007 title I've ever purchased. Despite some obviously dated effects (e.g., several ""matted in"" 'aereal' scenes), this was a very pleasant surprise in every way in terms of both the film itself and the quality of the Blu-ray. Lots of action, plus a cool plot, and some funny lines from Mr. Moore and the very entertaining ""Jaws"" character that always turns up no matter where 007 goes! I think the space scenes give it a nice added hint of sci-fi that you don't always get in Bond films. I actually enjoyed the film so much and the beautiful cinematography (particularly in Rio de Genaro) that I watched it again as soon as it was over just to look at the stunning image quality! If you're both a bond fan and a real sucker for excellent image and sound quality, this Blu-ray disc is a treat! I only have a 720P plasma, and this film from 1979 has better image quality than some more recent films. (E.g., Just saw Blu-ray of Bram Stoker's Dracula from '92. A much newer film, but of course perhaps due to artistic intent, with a decidedly softer image. Certainly Better than a standard DVD, but nowhere near as sharp as Moonraker). The 5.1 HD Master Audio track is also quite robust and pretty directional for its age. Many of the scenes boast almost 3-D-like image quality, with jaw-dropping color and detail (check out the scene where 007 is on a boat looking through a telescope. The lens almost ""jumps"" out of the screen.) The aereal scenes and scenes in Rio de genaro and Venice have to be seen to be appreciated. The detail in the buildings and scenery is outrageous! Blu-ray is here to stay... simply the most amazing video medium ever... Like a great car you want to keep driving, the more I experience Blu-ray the more I appreciate it.

1399001,4,B000056OCJ,"The mention of ""Moonraker"" usually elicits controversey.  Serious Bond fans usually despise it due to its far-out premise of sending Bond into outer space at the conclusion.  Yet, if you just want a relaxing and entertaining film, ""Moonraker"" is wonderful entertainment.  This was Roger Moore's 4th Bond film, the Bond film right after his personal triumph in ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" Moore's best Bond and one of the most lavish and entertaining films in the series.  ""Moonraker"" is nowhere as good as that film, but it is fun nonetheless.  If anything, the main problem with ""Moonraker"" is that it tries to give the audience too much, usually to the detriment of the film.  There is a gondola chase scene in Venice that concludes with the gondola driving up into St. Peter's Square and Moore driving through hundreds of tourists that makes me cringe everytime I see it.  There is a totally unnecessary scene of Moore being attacked by a large python and dispatching it with a CIA device that he should not logically have.  This scene and the previous one should have wound up on the cutting-room floor.
However ""Moonraker"" does have academy-award nominated special effects, wonderful location work, a beautiful all-American leading lady in Lois Chiles and a wild confrontation between American Marine Astronauts(?) and the villain's stooges in outer space. (Sort of like the underwater fight-scene at the conclusion of ""Thunderball"" transferred to outer space.)  In an attempt to outdo the pre-credits sequence of ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" ""Moonraker"" has Bond being pushed out of a plane without a parachute.  This is a terrific and exciting sequence.  (One thing ""Moonraker"" has an did not need was the return of Richard Kiel as ""Jaws.""  The attempt to turn him into a good guy at the end was ridiculous."")
""Moonraker"" was a smash hit in the summer of 1979 and received mostly positive reviews from the likes of The NY Times and Rex Reed.  It played to sell-out crowds.
The picture and sound on this blu-ray are excellent.  There is an excellent Roger Moore commentary.  Most of the special features have been seen before including a terrific ""making of"" documentary, another great documentary on the special effects of the Bond films, vintage interviews, etc.  The special features are very good.

1399006,2,B000056OCJ,"I thought for the longest time that I would be incapable *not* liking a James Bond film.  From `Diamonds Are Forever' to `Die Another Day', there had not been a ""Bad"" Bond film that I didn't find some redeeming value in.  I guess in an over twenty movie-long franchises I was bound to come across one that I wouldn't enjoy, and the day finally came.  Moonraker is without a doubt the worst James Bond film I have ever seen.  Everything about the film just comes across as wrong.  From the random references to popular science-fiction films, to Moore using the same gadget to solve just about all his problems, this film feels like an exercise in camp, and pointlessness.  These were present in other Moore films, but never were they as poorly used as in Moonraker.

The plot is pathetic, and when Bond finally gets into space it really is worthless, as it only lasts about twenty minutes.  The plot is almost non-existent, and the villain is one of the most forgettable ones in the franchise's history.  Jaws also returns from `The Spy Who Loves Me,' which does lead to one of my favorite Bond lines: ""All I know is his name is Jaws.  He kills people.""  Funny bit of dialogue, and often Moore does give good one-liners in this film, but they can't compare to the many bad bits of comic relief thrown in throughout.

Only die-hard Bond fans should own this film.  Yes, I purchased it, because I am a fan of the series, and like re-watching all the films on a fairly frequent basis, but I can say that Moonraker will be the one I return to most seldom, and will do so only with friends so that we can point fingers, laugh, and engage in conversation.

When Cubby came up with the idea for this abortion, he said something like ""It's not science fiction, it's science fact."" Well if we're supposed to believe that Space in real life is Star Warsish, than this is indeed ""Science fact""- a Turd of one, that is.

It's just a complete and utter disaster. A completely inane and stupid plot, a bored looking and sweaty Moore, a cheesy-as-all-hell final fight, this all equals an incredibly cheap and cheesy Bond that's disgusting and just plain awful. And what was with the ""Bondola""?

1399010,3,B000056OCJ,"After ""Stars wars"", ""Alien"" and the space as probable battlefield for the two great potencies of those ages, the producers of the Bond series, decided something should be done around making a script that dealt with this thematic. Just remember, we are in 1978 and the War Space dominates the first video games by then, it's to say the fictional nightmares foreseen in 2001 have reached its adultness and the very fact of planning an outer conflict beyond the barriers of the atmosphere was more than a bad feeling. That's the reason why Moonraker emerged as first priority to make the series would not lessen. Bond needed to achieve his role as space hero too, because the espionage issues simply couldn't ignore that surrounding reality. The fact that 2010 was made in 1984 carves in relief that many screenwriters were aware about the new tendencies of the entertainment industry by then.

Due these circumstances, Moonraker was provided of an undeniable big budget to make great space sequences at the end of the movie ( I must confess that those sequences between the good and the bad guys in the middle of the interstellar space were so closely tied with the marvelous submarine sequences in Thunder ball). Besides the multiple stages Rio de Janeiro, Venice (where Lewis Gilbert simply couldn't avoid to pay a deserved homage to David Lean's ""Summertime"" (remember the sequence of the bridge, it's the same location in which Katherine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi have his ""wet encounter"").

So everything promised an admirable space saga but the main flaw was at least to my mind the persistent presence of ""Jaws"" in practically all the action sequences and the incredible love story between him and a nave girl (The girl with the flaxen hair) and the final ambition of the main villain (Michael Lonsdale was excessively cold, without that bitter humor of let's say Goldfinger). But what it really disappointed me more was that unbelievable final in which ""Jaws"" redeems himself and miraculously turns a good guy as a miracle of love, give me a break.

Those structural twists during the decade and a half of Moore playing Bond really affected seriously the majesty of the personage. Somehow Bond suffered a real process of ""Americanization"" (that really achieved its peak with the actual 007, Daniel Craig) in order to dive Bond into fashionable waters.

Brilliant special effects, beauty women and wonderful landscapes, but these conceptual flaws were lead upon the wing.

What a pity!.",1232582400,,2492,4.995180722891567
1399011,3,B000056OCJ,"The Bottom Line:

A pretty silly film that shamelessly tried to capitalize on the space craze set in motion by 1977's Star Wars, Moonraker features a character named ""Holly Goodhead,"" laser fights in space, a steel-teethed villain who falls in love with a nerdy girl half his age, and a villain whose agenda is pretty much the same as the previous Bond villain, but in space not underwater--in a word, pass.",1230249600,,407,4.732394366197183
1399012,1,B000056OCJ,"Other films promise you the moon. Moonraker delivers  boasted the eleventh James Bond film that finally took 007 into the one territory he had not previously conquered - outer space. Oh, he nearly got there in You Only Live Twice, if Blofeld had not pulled him out of the SPECTRE rocket, but then Twice was made in the era when the Bonds always kept at least one foot in reality no matter have far fetched the plots became. However perverse parody became the hallmark of the Roger Moore canon, more like Our Man Flint than Ian Fleming. With the success of Star Wars making sci-fi a fashionable cinematic genre again, and the outward bound sounding title Moonraker at his disposal, Cubby Broccoli decreed it was time to boldly assign 007 to where no Bond had been before. The resulting film has been the source of contention among Bond fans ever since.

The film's plot Bond on the trail of a missing Moonraker space shuttle, hijacked on its way to England for a software fitment. Investigation commences with the manufacturer of the shuttle, billionaire Sir Hugo Drax, who Bond begins to suspect as being in on the hijack when Drax's henchmen made several attempts to kill him - well that would make you suspicious wouldn't it.

Bond follows Drax to Venice, where our undercover secret agent maintains discretion by driving a hover-gondola across St Mark's Square, much to the amusement of the pigeons. Joining forces with CIA agent Holly Goodhead, the pair jet off to Rio where steel toothed lug Jaws has decided to come pop along and join in the fun.

The villains grab Goodhead and Bond tracks down Drax's Amazon lair, complete with six Moonraker shuttles ready for launch. Bond and Holly are reunited in incarceration, but escape being toasted underneath one of the shuttles only to stowaway on another. Once on board Drax's space station, the dastardly plan to destroy all human life on Earth and replace it with a master race is revealed. Bond alerts the authorities and the station is attacked, Jaws switching sides when he sees which way the tide is turning. Drax takes a one way trip to oblivion, while Bond and Goodhead become the first couple to make love in zero gravity; unless there is something NASA is keeping quiet about.

Unsurprisingly the film bears no relation to the Fleming novel, using only the title, the character name of Hugo Drax and a single scene where Bond and his girl are imprisoned underneath the rocket, Drax intending to celebrate its launch with a human barbecue. The book had Hugo Drax as the sponsor of a revolutionary Moonraker missile, which he intends to test by firing it into the North Sea. But Bond and Special Branch officer Gala Brand discover Drax is really nazi war criminal Graf Hugo von der Drache and not from Liverpool after all. He installs a nuclear warhead in the Moonraker with the intention of firing it on London to avenge the defeat of the Third Reich. As Drax makes his escape in a submarine, Bond alters the missile's course and blows Drax's sub out of the water, an idea used in the film of The Spy Who Loved Me.

Cubby Broccoli dismissed the novel as dated, saying ""We have one piddling little rocket threatening London. We want a threat to the whole world."" Throwing out the book's plot, Broccoli had his team come up with an original screenplay. After a lot of hard thinking they came up with a blatant remake of The Spy Who Loved Me, shifting the central setting from underwater to outer space. A bit unfortunate considering that Spy itself is a remake of You Only Live Twice, substituting the sea for outer space. The absurdities of the aforementioned Connery film were successfully glossed over by playing the whole thing with a straight face. Moonraker could have worked with the same approach but is undermined by an overdose of Carry On humour and the persistence of Jaws, a cartoonish character who had become tedious about halfway through his previous film. With a redundancy of character potential, Jaws simply botches one assassination attempt after another, with unfortunate rebounding consequences on his person. The resemblance to Wile. E . Coyote - even down to the ""Doh. What went wrong"" expressions on his face - is so strong that one can only assume his professional equipment is supplied by Acme.

Roger Moore is, well, Roger Moore. While fun and entertaining when the action is rolling, he always seemed to lack conviction when called on to play the serious stuff. Moore's moments of human drama in Spy, where Bond reacts to Anya mentioning his wife and when Anya discovers Bond had killed her boyfriend, were particularly weakened by the actor's apparent discomfort, delivering his lines as if he was reciting a shopping list. However Moore does come across better in Moonraker than usual. When he emerges from near death in the centrifuge, there is none of the usual Moore-isms; he is shaken, probably stirred and suffering to the point of speechlessness; a definite first for Jolly Roger.

The evocatively named Gala Brand was re-christened the more provocative Holly Goodhead and the dishy Lois Chiles made a satisfactory job of her, despite not once appearing in the skimpy costume worn on the film poster. Michael Lonsdale is disappointing as Hugo Drax, playing the part with a one dimensional monotone that worked for Joseph Wiseman's Dr No and Donald Pleasance's Blofeld, but had become somewhat cliched and tiresome since. The scarred, deformed Nazi of Fleming's novel would have been better served by Jeremy Kemp or James Mason (who was considered for the part) , while retaining his SS background would have given the film Drax more depth to his motivations. However, Lonsdale's characterisation does lend a certain droll to much of his dialogue, particularly when he orders his servant Chang ""Look after Mr. Bond. See some harm comes to him.""

Derek Meddings executes the special effects with his usual finesse, the climatic space battle being particularly spectacular though the sound of lazers and explosions puts paid to Broccoli's promise that Moonraker would not be science fiction but science fact. Like George Lucas, Moonraker uses the laws of physics when it suits and discards them when it doesn't, but this is a minor quibble. The real sore point about the film's climax is Jaw's rather unconvincing conversion into a good guy and his infatuation for a diminutive Daisy May character complete with blond pigtails and steel rimmed bins; a real forunner for Spice Girl Emma Bunton if there ever was one.

The infuriating thing about Moonraker is that it could have worked if the it had been structured to be as straight and realistic as possible, in order to support the more fantastical elements of the screenplay.  Instead, it is undermined by pointless chases and idiotic jokes, including a ludicrous power gondolier chase through the canals of Venice, which replaced what could have been a more inventive motorcycle pursuit through the same location.  Screenwriter Christopher Wood later distanced himself from these aspects of Moonraker, claiming that the visual jokes were later added by the production team. His rather serious novelisation of the script that accompanied the film's release is probably more indicative of what he had envisaged.

Moonraker may not have been a hit with the fans but it was with the public, turning out the highest grossing Bond of its time (though inflation adjusted figures still put Thunderball at the top). With the fashionable motif of space adventure and residual expectations from the success of Spy, it would have been more surprising if Moonraker had flopped. Despite this success, Moonraker proved to be the last of its kind. Broccoli realised that the franchise had gone too far in the cartoon direction and resolved to bring Bond down to earth with a kiss-kiss-bang-bang.",1229299200,,7825,4.918939393939394
1399013,5,B000056OCJ,"It's hard for me to argue with people who hate Moonraker. It is the most cartoonish of all the Bond movies reaching its peak of silliness right off the bat with Jaws, returning from The Spy Who Loved Me, surviving a freefall from an airplane. The absurdity is made all the more tragic in that it follows one of, if not the most spectacular Bond opening in the entire series. Moonraker is a movie with sky high highlights and some pretty bad lowlights. The pre-credit sequence with Bond being shoved from an airplane sans parachute is thrilling and leads into the spectacular Moonraker theme sung by Shirley Bassey. This movie may have the best musical score of any of the Bond movie and that is no small feat.

Moonraker was created by some of the most talented people ever to work on the Bond films. John Barry produced the music, John Glen was the film editor and the set designs were still being created by Ken Adam. Unless you're a ravenous Bond fan like me you may have never heard of Ken Adam but his work probably has as much to do with the success of Bond as anything and Moonraker is one of his best. The locations in Moonraker also excel, in particular the French estate owned by Hugo Drax is absolutely one of the most beautiful backdrops of any of the Bond films.

The incredible music and set design are so good they take a mediocre plot and create something special. Here is an example. Late in the movie Bond is searching a river in South America in a speedboat. It's really irrelevant how he get to this point because the scripting is paper thin but the music that kicks up when Jaws and Drax's henchmen attack is perfect. Next Bond happens to stumble across Drax's lair and what a set. It looks incredible and the design of the command center is absolutely breathtaking. Even the final space battle between the space marines and Drax's men is rather goofy but the music is done so well that it works.

I fully understand if people don't like this film. It is the least serious entry in the series existing in a completely different universe than films like `From Russia with Love' and `Casino Royale' but there are moments that really make the film. When Bond staggers out of the G-Force simulator it is one of the very few moments in the Bond series where James looks really human and wounded. It is perhaps Roger Moore's best moment as Bond. I also tend to be a sucker for the crazy zillionare who wants to take over the world scenario. I'm going to give this one five full stars because I find it to be one of the most watchable of all the Bond movies.",1225756800,,2572,4.421940928270042

1399017,5,B000056OCJ,"I steered clear of MOONRAKER (1979) for years because critics unanimously said it was awful. In 2003 I systematically went through the Moore era and finally came to MOONRAKER, fully expecting to see a real dog. Wow, was I wrong! MOONRAKER is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end and one of the best films of Roger Moore's 7-film stint in the series.

THE PLOT: Bond investigates Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) after a space shuttle on loan to the British is stolen. James slowly discovers that Drax has a mad scheme to re-create a human race of perfect human specimens. The giant villainous sidekick Jaws (Richard Kiel) returns from THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977) as 007 teams up with the beautiful Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles). The story climaxes with a spectacular space battle at Drax' space station.

WHAT WORKS: Everything in MOONRAKER is over the top! The locations, the action, the villain's mad scheme, the humor, the seriousness, Jaws and the space-battle finale. This works fabulously because Bond films were never meant to be deep, thought-provoking pieces of art, but rather grandiose pieces of thrilling eye candy.

One thing that I demand in any Bond adventure is great globe-trotting and spectacular locations. This is one of the reasons I consider LICENCE TO KILL (1989) weak, but MOONRAKER delivers in spades! The film starts out with breathtaking scenes high above Napa Valley, California, as Bond engages in a thrilling sky-diving duel. From there we get France, Venice, Rio De Janeiro, the jungles of Brazil & Guatemala and the spectacular Iguazu Waterfalls, Argentina.

Lois Chiles is one of the more beautiful and competent Bond ""girls."" Of course her name -- ""Dr. Goodhead"" -- is ludicrous in the tradition of Pussy Galore and Chew Mee (lol).

Drax is a formidable, serious nemesis contrasted by the cartoony villainy of Jaws.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The film works on every level in entertaining the viewer, but -- depending on one's tastes -- some people may have one or two cavils. For instance, many criticize the goofy humor associated with Jaws. The good thing is that it's really funny and you'll likely bust out laughing a number of times. Regardless, the picture remains an essentially serious story, albeit totally outlandish, which is in keeping with the series (e.g. GOLDFINGER and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE).

Others object to the notion of Bond in space. I don't get this beef. He's been all over the earth and in every ocean, why not have an adventure in space for something new? Some have criticized that MOONRAKER was trying to go ""Star Wars"", but this makes no sense; MOONRAKER has nothing in common with ""Star Wars."" It's like arguing that THUNDERBALL ripped-off ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" because it has underwater scenes.

Something else I'd like to point out: One of the reasons I steered clear from MOONRAKER for so many years was because I thought most of the film took place in space, and space is not something I seek in a Bond flick, but this isn't the case. Bond doesn't go up in space until over an hour & a half into the story! Overall, only 23% of the film takes place in space. More importantly, the climax is actually interesting and exciting unlike the ending of, say, THE SPY WHO LOVED, which was boring.

FINAL ANALYSIS: Roger Moore has done more Bond films than any other actor (which is only matched by Sean Connery if you include his unofficial 1983 entry NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN). Roger started the role in 1973 when he was 45 and ended in 1985 at the age of 57 (!!). Regardless of his age he always looked great and perfectly convincing as 007 -- yes, even in A VIEW TO A KILL. His films contained more humor and action than the slightly-more-serious early 60's films, which were fantastical and absurd in their own way (e.g. Oddball's killer hat, etc.), but Moore's stint isn't so different when you consider Connery's later films, like YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and especially DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Many prefer the Connery era, and I certainly appreciate those films, but I find the Moore era to be the most consistently entertaining in the series. Every one of his films was successful at the box office and MOONRAKER was the most successful Bond film until Pierce Brosnan's GOLDENEYE in 1995. There's not a dud in Moore's bunch. They're colorful, vibrant and full of pizazz.

The film runs 126 minutes.

1399018,2,B000056OCJ,"Roger Moore's biggest box-office hit during his tenure as Bond, Moonraker has seen its reputation plummet to the point where its widely regarded as the worst film in the entire series. It's not exactly difficult to see why. The ill-advised jokes that end the otherwise stunningly shot pretitle sequence of Jaws and a parachuteless Bond battling midair unfortunately give a hint of what is to come, but for the first 35 minutes it chugs along very competently, even throwing in one good setpiece in a G-Force simulator. Then comes the gondola/hovercraft sequence, a setpiece that abandons any notion of internal logic for cheap gags and illustrates one of the film's biggest problems: there's no real menace when we know Bond doesn't need to rely on his wits because he's got an absurd gadget for every occasion, and without any sense of threat the action scenes constantly fall flat. Many of them aren't even particularly well-staged but look rather haphazardly thrown together. Worse still, by offering the second consecutive reworking of You Only Live Twice's plot (all from the same director, Lewis Gilbert) it all feels like it's just going through the motions because they can't think of anything better to do.

While it doesn't show the contempt for Bond that Octopussy seemed to revel in as it seemed to go out of its way to humiliate Bond by making him literally butt of all the jokes, it constantly winks at the audience as if to say ""We know it's nonsense, but at least it's very expensive nonsense."" Unfortunately, it does set up two of the least welcome future developments in the series - as well as being the one where the product placement started to get out of control (my, didn't 7-Up and British Airways do well?), it also started the unfortunate tradition of the Michael G. Wilson cameo. Still, it's nice to see Bernard Lee getting to play a warmer M in his final Bond, finally proud of the boy (the film is very much the end of an era, with most of the surviving members of the old team breaking up - this was Lee, Gilbert and Ken Adam's last film), the great special effects are genuinely impressive even 28 years on and Michel Lonsdale provides the series with one of its best villains and gets all the best lines (""Look after Mr Bond. See that some harm comes to him"") even if he is wasted by the derivative plot.

There's not a huge amount in the way of new extras on this two-disc Ultimate Edition - Roger Moore's audio commentary, a 1979 making of featurette, footage of the Rio shoot, test footage for the skydiving sequence and a couple of storyboard sequences.

1399021,3,B000056OCJ,"This is the point where the Bond franchise took a silly turn. Obviously inspired by the phenomenal success of the sci-fi fantasy ""Star Wars"", James Bond was launched into space. ""Moonraker"" is so crammed with space hardware and overblown gadgetry that it's barely about Bond at all; the producers lost focus on the main subject, almost parodying him.
The criminal industrialist Drax is just another loony-as-a-bedbug power-mad villain cut from the same clothe as the previous Bond baddies. One of the most blase performances from a Bond villain ever.
On the plus side: The menacing, steel-toothed Jaws returns from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" to liven things up as he picks up where he left off---trying to put the bite on Bond. The subplot in which the mute Jaws is softened by love & becomes an ally is campy too but ultimately touching.
""Moonraker"" is entertaining popcorn fun, but beyond that, it's little more than a far-fetched ""spy-in-space"" opera. Roger Moore would re-bound with his following outings, but it would really take his exit from the role to get the franchise back on track.",1196208000,,1089,4.923913043478261
1399022,4,B000056OCJ,"The first time I watched Moonraker I was honestly blown away by the large scaleness of this Bond film - keeping in tradition with the prior The Spy Who Loved Me film.  The locations and variety of suspense and action was one-of-a-kind, but upon a few more viewings, I began to see where it all started to go wrong.  For such a big film, this is perhaps oe of the laziest Bond films ever made.  Roger Moore isn't the only one at fault here - even the Bond girl and main villain seem to be sleeping on the job.

Moore has seemed to have aged rather quickly after his first 3 Bond films, and in Moonraker, seems to be a bit sluggish to everything around him.  The dry humor seems to have hit an all time low, and the charm towards the ladies feels tiresome.  I get the impression Moore wasn't very interested in this film, but the script didn't really help provide very exciting lines to work with.  Hugo Drax is the super-villain, and in the tradition of large-scale Bond movies, has plans for world domination.  He owns all the manufacturing plants for Moonraker shuttles, and steals them to transport his perfect humans to a space station - there he plans to use the poisonous pollen of a rare orchard to wipe out human life on Earth.  Unfortunately, Drax too looks terribly unexcited with his role, and is nearly unemotional with the majority of his lines.  He has two notable henchmen - Chang - who does gives Bond a good fight in a glass factory (but he's no Oddjob, that's for sure) and the return of Jaws, who was still pleasing to watch, though too goofy this time around after his introduction in The Spy Who Loved Me.

What still manages to keep Moonraker a fun ride is the combinations of locations and action.  The film begins with an exciting and breathtaking scene of Bond and Jaws battling it out in the sky, falling to the Earth without parachutes out - followed by the opening credits paired with the gorgeous Moonraker theme.  After the credits, things start to role in California, at the Drax estate, which is absolutely marvelous - perhaps the biggest villain estate seen in all of the Bond films.  Bond continues to Venice, where we see some good fights and boat chases through the Venetian canals.  Then Bond travles to Rio, where some of the most spectacular arial views of the bay are shown, including a very fun cable car fight between Bond and Jaws high above the city.  After Rio, Bond heads deeper into Brazil, where another boat chase occus on the Brazilian rivers, which ends in an array of waterfalls.  Lastly, Bond travels to space along with Drax and Jaws (not the real space of course).  The space station scene is entertaining, but feels extremely odd for Bond, and the effects and action are ok, but really extremely cheesy.

A big time Bond adventure that was wasted by uninteresting actors and script is what Moonraker comes down to.  This movie is worth it just to see some fabulous scenery - some of the best ever.  The whole space thing is a little ridiculous, but some may find it an enjoyable change of pace.

From the beginning, it seems like we know where this one is going, and it certainly walks that way, by way of an overabundance of comedic gags and one-liners, and an overly simple plot.  The makers obviously took advantage of the popularity of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, as well as trying to top the sci-fi flicks of the 70's, but it captures some of the hugeness and vastness of a super-spy doin' good in outer space. It also is an example of how a Bond film captures the danger and sense of doom and villany.  The chases are classics, despite the one-liners, but the flow of the film is well-paced.  The space battle is not the quickest but it makes up for it in the brilliant special effects.  Roger Moore is not in his best-his humor having got in the way.  But he is dynamic when it comes to the ladies. Check out some of his more successful acting scenes, some which you won't see until his next, more ground-based 007 film, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  In fact, this movie is an important preview to some of the next two, dynamite epic 007's. John Barry practically saves the film and gives it the sense of danger and excitement not seen since the Connery days.  Roger Moore stays on for the next, more tightly delivered two Bonds, leaving this one in the dust.  The best part: The return of Jaws!",1193616000,,1513,4.333333333333333
1399024,3,B000056OCJ,"I remember seeing Moonraker when it first came out at the cinema - as a young boy, it seemed like the best Bond ever - bigger and better than all the rest.
How times have changed.
This movie starts out on a high note - literally, as Bond is thrown out of a plane without a parachute.  It is a breathtaking reminder that once there was a time when for a Bond movie, this sort of spectacular unique stunt was done for real.  However, then follows the theme song - one of the most turgid and uninspired of the Bond movies, and a sign of what is to follow.  From a French chateau recreated in California, to Venice and on to Brazil, the movie covers ground, and actually has Bond spying and involving in skulking around - the first time he has done that in a while in the series.  But the tone falters... there are some great lighthearted moments (gondola chase), and there are some significantly dark moments (the beautiful pilot Corrine gets mauled by dogs in an extended chase scene), which do not sit well next to each other.  The director could have done better - Moore actually looks even more relaxed in the role than he did in The Spy Who Loved Me, and not yet too old even as he was turning 50, and Lois Chiles plays well as an initially ice cool astronaut.
Really it does check off all the boxes for a great 70's Bond movie - the big stunt, the boat chase, the beautiful ladies, the droll monotone Michael Lonsdale playing the heavy (if only someone had given him a white Persian cat to stroke he would have been perfect...), and the return of the popular Jaws character, this time showing a softer side.  Why, the whole idea of the story has been lifted from the previous film, with the bad guy seeking to destroy humanity so that a new master race can survive under the sea / in space (delete as appropriate) and repopulate.
No, it is the last act that really trips up the movie looking back on it now - the effects have been done terrifically well, for the time, especially since they were done in-house, without the aid of an effects company.  It is the whole misconceived space station and subsequent laser shoot out in space.  Terrific then, horribly dated now.  It just seems to drag on too long to be exciting,  much like other sci-fi movies of the time which were too impressed with their own special effects to use the scissors.  And since when did blowing up the villains lair seem a good idea - when it was in space, and you were still on it??
Well, let's not be too churlish.  It's a Bond movie, in the true escapist mould.  It has terrific moments, and it still entertains.. for that I am willing to let it scrape through on 3 stars.. but be warned, for every moment that makes you cheer, there are a few moments lurking round the next plot twist to make you groan...

Ultimate Edition delivers yet again on sound, and bright sharp colours for the picture.  The usual extras are here from the Special Edition, and a few more - but truth be told nothing too riveting, save perhaps for Ken Adams home movies of the production (his last Bond movie).  Roger Moore also adds a talk track on the movie.
5 /10 for the movie, 9 /10 for the extras.",1191888000,,3159,4.33786078098472
1399025,5,B000056OCJ,"When I first saw this film I remember that it really broke my heart. I grew up in the 60s on James Bond and Sean Connery amongst others. The first 45 minutes of ""Moonraker"" was the closest that the Roger Moore Bonds had ever come to the look and feel of the James Bond films of the 60s. It was really incredible. Equally incredible was how the film did a flip-flop into slapstick when Bond is floating down that canal in Venice. As the film progressed the level of slapstick escalated. It was just plain out ridicules. The film was very annoying.

I thought Roger Moore had finally combined his best qualities as a personality and an actor to represent James Bond in this film. His scene in the centrifuge showed his ability to bring depth to the character in a very credible way. This one scene is a standout because it equals any performance given by any of the actors that have portrayed James Bond in this series. Christopher Wood, given sole screenplay credit this time, delivered a script full of witty dialogue. The free-fall pre-credit sequence with John Barry's background score, incredible stunt work and cinematography was excellent. With so many fine elements at their peak of perfection it was a shame that the film unraveled in so many different directions.

When I saw this film on opening day I remembered how the whole lobby was crammed with people. As I sat during the film I remember a little boy who was sitting in front of me turn around and look at his father. ""Daddy I really like this movie."" I never forgot that. It took me about 10 years to understand what this film was really all about. The Bond films have been around for almost 40 years now. I suppose with each decade another generation of Bond fans is born. Each generation takes with them the fond memories of their introduction to James Bond. Each generation savors the moment and no matter what I or anyone else says is going to erase those memories. The magic of ""Moonraker"" is that it contains the best to the worst, or the worst to the best, of all the elements found in the series. There is something in ""Moonraker"" for everyone.",1191542400,,2118,4.541884816753926
1399026,5,B000056OCJ,"I steered clear of MOONRAKER (1979) For years because critics unanimously said it was awful. Well, in 2003 I was on a Bond kick and systematically saw most of the films (the ones I didn't see I was already well familiar with, like GOLDFINGER). Anyway, I was going through the Moore era and finally came to MOONRAKER fully expecting to see a real dog. WOW, was I wrong! MOONRAKER is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end and one of the BEST films of Roger Moore's 7-film stint in the series.

THE PLOT: Bond investigates Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) after a space shuttle on loan to the British is stolen. Drax has a mad scheme to destroy the entire human race via nerve gas loosed from his hidden space station, starting over with what he considers perfect human specimens. The giant villainess sidekick Jaws (Richard Kiel) returns from THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977) to stop Bond as 007 teams up with the beautiful Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles). The story climaxes with a spectacular space battle at the space station.

WHAT WORKS: Everything in MOONRAKER is over the top! The locations, the action, the villain's mad scheme, the humor, the seriousness, Jaws and the space-battle finale. This works fabulously because Bond films were never meant to be deep, thought-provoking pieces of art, but rather grandiose fun pieces of pure entertainment.

One thing that I demand in any Bond adventure is great globe-trotting and spectacular locations. MOONRAKER delivers in this area in spades! The film starts out with breathtaking scenes high above Napa Valley, California, as Bond engages in a thrilling sky-diving duel. From there we get France, Venice, Italy, Rio De Janeiro, the jungles of Brazil & Guatemala and the spectacular Iguazu Waterfalls, Argentina.

Lois Chiles is one of the more beautiful and competent Bond ""girls."" Of course her name -- ""Dr. Goodhead"" (yeah, right) -- is ludicrous in the tradition of Pussy Galore and Chew Mee (LOL).

Drax is a formidable, serious villain contrasted by the cartooney villainy of Jaws.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As far as I'm concerned the film works on every level in entertaining the viewer, but -- depending on one's tastes -- some people may have one or two cavils. For instance, many criticize the goofy humor associated with Jaws. The good thing is that this humor is really funny -- you'll likely bust out laughing a number of times throughout the flick. Regardless, the picture remains an essentially serious story, albeit fantastical.

Others object to the notion of Bond in space. What's the problem? He's been all over the earth and in every ocean, why not have an adventure in space for something new? I don't get the beef. Some have criticized that MOONRAKER was trying to go ""Star Wars"", but this makes no sense; MOONRAKER has nothing in common with ""Star Wars."" It's like absurdly arguing that THUNDERBALL ripped-off ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" because it has underwater scenes (as another reviewer more eloquently pointed out). Listen, compared to MOONRAKER ""Star Wars"" is a kiddie space flick (and, no, I don't care how much money it's made).

Something else I'd like to point out: One of the reasons I steered clear from MOONRAKER for so many years was because I thought most of the film took place in space (sssnnnnooooorrrreee). This isn't the case at all. Bond dosn't go up in space until over an hour and a half into the story! Overall, only 23% of the film takes place in space.

FINAL ANALYSIS: Roger Moore has done more Bond films than any other actor (not including Connery's unofficial NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN). He started the role in 1973 when he was 45 and ended in 1985 at the age of 57 (!!). Regardless of his age he always looked great and perfectly convincing as 007. His films contained more humor and action than the sightly-more-serious 60's Connery films, which were fantastical and absurd in their own way (Oddball's killer hat, etc.). Many prefer the Connery era, and I certainly appreciate those films, but I find the Moore era to be the most consistently entertaining. Every one of his films was hugely successful at the box office. There's not a dud in the bunch; I don't care what anyone says. They're colorful, vibrant and full of pizzazz, unlike Pierce Brosnan's ultra-dour stint.",1191542400,,4275,4.861263736263736

That aside, Moonraker is ridiculous. It is an absolute disgrace to the Bond series. It takes Bond and turns him into a slapstick comedy character, and the movie is absolutely BORING. I wasn't a big fan of Moore, but The Spy Who Loves Me and For Your Eyes only are masterpieces next to this disaster.",1189987200,,449,4.769230769230769

Still if you like Roger Moore Bond movies then this is right for you, cause most of his are over the top anyway.  If you love Bond this is one you should see, but understand it's so over the top that you'll wonder if you're watching a Bond movie at the end.",1189728000,,394,3.962025316455696
1399029,2,B000056OCJ,"James Bond at its wimpiest. In my opinion, not the best James Bond. Roger Moore looks like a tired 007. There is barely any emotion shown in the movie by Moore and it lacks dynamic performances. The film is also a bit disjointed and the plot is not well tied together. Gotta love Jaws though...he is a great henchman! But, there is even a laser gun...Star Wars anyone?",1189555200,,368,4.426470588235294

The villain Drax, well played with icy quiet menace by Michael Lonsdale, is the only Bond bad guy that can compare to my favorite, Aurick Goldfinger. There are certain symphonic musical passages in the film that are absolutely gorgeous to listen to such as the music heard during Bond's discovery of the orchids growing place in the Amazon while several stunning women appear. Bond's CIA counterpart, Dr. Holly Goodhead, played by Lois Chiles is for me the sexiest woman in all the Bond films. Wow. The storyline and script are among the best of the Bond films and hold the whole thing together nicely.

There is a style and coolness in this one that you only get in the Connery Bond films.

If you are one of those hardcore Sean Connery Bond fans that won't even watch a Roger Moore Bond flick, I highly recommend you give this one a chance. Its a shame that none of the other Moore Bond movies can compare with this one. God knows they had enough attempts at it.",1178323200,,1139,4.393364928909953
1399034,3,B000056OCJ,"Last night I decided to watch the most controversial James Bond Film Moonraker. Id say 60% of it was great. As good as any Roger Moore Bond film. But that other 40% was so weird that it almost ruined the whole thing.

The high performance motor-driven gondola he had in Venice was REALLY BAD. The gondola even turned into a hover craft (???????????????????). Bond also had a few cheesy fight scenes with Jaws that were hard to watch. Also Jaws finding a girlfriend (??????)(Who was actually pretty by the way) was a bit too much to bare.

Moonraker came out after Star Wars and they wanted to put Bond in space. Which thankfully was only the last 30 minutes of the film. I threw in the towel when a full fledged SPACE WAR broke out between American Space Marines and Drex's evil hoard. Just a bunch of guys floating around in space suits with LASER GUNS, ala Star Wars. That was it for me.......Its a shame because the rest of the movie was pretty good.",1176854400,,953,4.44
1399035,3,B000056OCJ,"""Moonraker"" is the James Bond movie that reached the height of cartoon antics that  plagued the world of 007 throughout the bell-bottomed seventies.  It's a low point for many die-hard fans; a point where the series veered without shame from Hitchcock-like thrills to Max Sennett-like madness.  For me, it's the guiltiest of pleasures. Read on.

As been observed by many, producer Albert R. Broccoli reeling from the world-wide success of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (James Bond's campy but self-assured comeback) took only the title and villain (Hugo Drax), from one of Ian Fleming strongest books to build what could have lazily been titled ""The Spy Who Loved Me II.""  Replace the previous movie's sea world motif with outer space and you have essentially the same movie-  Bond aided by equally adept female spy goes after megalomaniac bent on world destruction. Bond blows up megalomaniac's operation.  Bond sleeps with female spy (this was also the exact template used for ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" but that's another review).  That said, through nearly half of ""Moonraker,"" returning screenwriter Christopher Wood does set up an intriguing mystery angle with our intrepid hero following nonsensical clues from what seems like the entire western hemisphere (A document in California, vials of poison in Venice, etc. etc...) But when the action starts, the filmmakers can't seem to reign themselves in and go for the cheap laugh time and time again.

 I agree for those who like their Bond films shaken, not stirred, that there is a lot here to cause a spewed martini.  For one, there is Roger Moore.  The very name is a scourge to those who prefer Sean Connery or Daniel Craig's bad boy Bonds.  After displaying a slight hard edge in the last half of ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" Moore gallivants through ""Moonraker"" like, well, Roger Moore- a likable, but flippant, jet setting, celebrity. Moore's Bond just sails too effortlessly throughout this adventure.  Even some of the gorgeous (of course) Bond girls like Corrine Clery and Emily Bolton seem to robotically sleep with Bond as if they were programmed to do so.  And then there's Jaws...As fiendishly good as Richard Kiel's Frankenstein Monster-of-a-hit-man was in TSWLM, bringing him back for a second outing in ""Moonraker"" and making him the ""Coyote"" to Moore's ""Road Runner"" leads to some the most draw-dropping, ""jumping-the-shark"" moments in the series history.

 Still there is a lot that surprisingly dazzles here. Whatever you may feel about the movie's school boy humor, Moonraker  is a slick, gorgeously photographed (the great Jean Tournier), action-packed package. It moves along with more zip than the oddball ""Man With The Golden Gun"" or the insanely plotted, (and the most debated among Bond fans) ""Die Another Day.""  Lois Chiles is appealing as the Lauren Bacall-esque ""Holly Goodhead"" (wink, wink) and Michael Lonsdale is, oddly enough, a deadly series Bond villain giving off such lines as ""Mr. Bond, you return with the inevitability of an unloved season"" with such oily ease.  ""Moonraker"" also has one of composer John Barry's more evocative scores that stubbornly soldiers on as if the movie was a true epic, not a lark.  However, the true star of this entry is legendary art director Ken Adams.  A master whose low-slung, futuristic set pieces marked the series' visual style beginning with ""Dr. No,"" Adams, in his last Bond film to date, gives us a near orgy of complex walk ways and shimmering steel.",1176681600,,3471,5.052631578947368
1399036,3,B000056OCJ,"MOONRAKER starts out as a very promising picture and is thoroughly entertaining--that is, until they decide to shoot Bond into space.  It's hard to know what happened on MOONRAKER.  After the terrific success of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, it seems that producer Albert Broccoli decided to make the same movie again, switching the underwater environment of the previous film to the outer space environment of the second.  Indeed, the whole choice to make MOONRAKER (after announcing that Bond would return in ""For Your Eyes Only"") seems to have been to capitalize on the recent success of STAR WARS and the like.  Broccoli even threw 34 million dollars at the film--over twice what THE SPY WHO LOVED ME cost.  In the end, nothing can save it and the film is just a bunch of wasted potential.

After the opening ""gun barrel"" sequence, we are greeted with yet another ""hijacking"" sequence, this time reminiscent of THUNDERBALL.  The scene opens up on a large Boeing 747 carrying a Moonraker space shuttle on its back.  Two stowaways sneak aboard the space shuttle and launch off the top of the plane, destroying the plane in their wake.  MI6 is soon on the prowl to determine how the craft could have been hijacked because England was in charge of its security.  We flash cut to Bond aboard a different plane, once again romancing a girl.  Only this time she is false and Bond gets pushed out of the plane by the returning Jaws without a parachute.  In a spectacular stunt diving sequence, Bond free falls and catches up to another parachuting bad guy, only to disrobe him of his parachute and use it to land safely.  While it is an amazing stunt, it feels a bit too similar to the opening of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  The titles roll, featuring falling silhouettes, an image of Moore, and other silhouettes in flight and bouncing on trampolines.  The theme is haunting, once again sung by Shirley Bassey, and is definitely not the worst Bond theme.

The plot, as I said, stinks of the previous one.  Bond is sent to investigate Drax Industries and its eccentric owner, Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), the company responsible for manufacturing the space shuttles.  Bond travels to California, but the producers wisely decided to transport Bond out of dull America and into French royalty by setting Drax's mansion in the style of an expensive French chateau.  Here, Bond meets Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), an American scientist working for Drax whom we later discover is actually a CIA agent.  It is clear that everything is not right at Drax's estate and Bond almost comes to his death a few times.  Drax is quite pompous and underestimates Bond at every turn.  Bond discovers some secret plans at Drax's estate and his adventures soon take him to Venice for a great part of the film. As Bond begins to get closer to the truth, the evil plans of Hugo Drax are revealed.  Drax has created a giant space station (much like Stromberg's ""Atlantis"" in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) that is invisible to radar.  Drax has transported a special race of humans (like Noah) to the space station and plans to release a poisonous toxin all over the Earth that targets human life.  After wiping out human existence and creating a master race, Drax plans to repopulate the Earth with his creation.  Will Bond be able to prevent the extinction of the human race before it is too late?

Despite the fact that MOONRAKER seems like an expensive remake of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the film is surprisingly enjoyable throughout most of its length.  Watching the relationship between Bond and Holly Goodhead is enjoyable and the action is also good.  The fight sequences are top notch, the Venice speedboat chase (while reminiscent of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN) is well done, the Amazon boat race ends in a spectacular hang glide over Iguazu Falls, and the gadgets are cool (particularly the cigarette case that opens to reveal a x-ray lockpicking kit).  Beyond that, the dialogue is pretty good and the return of Jaws keeps the comedy fresh and strangely appealing.  Not bad.  But then, Bond launches into space and the movie grinds to a dead halt.  The space sequences are terrible.  Yes, the special effects are good for the time.  Yes, the scale and style of Ken Adams' set is amazing.  But beyond that, the action is just boring.  The fight sequence is a dull rip-off of the underwater sequence in THUNDERBALL, the volcano sequence in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, and the oil tanker fight in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  It just doesn't work this time around.  The lasers look fake, the action is slow, and the plot is tedious.

I won't even bother to mention the acting performances in the film because this film is not about acting: it is all about larger-than-life ridiculous action.  But, as I said, the film really succeeds for most of its length before falling apart before the finish line.  If only the producers had chopped off the last twenty minutes or so.  But we can talk about ifs all we want.  Needless to say, MOONRAKER is often considered one of the worst Bond films, one of the cheesiest Moore films (and that's saying something), and the height of the ridiculousness of the series.  The producers should have left Bond on Earth and not tried to capitalize on the STAR WARS trend.  The Ultimate Edition looks and sounds great.  It also includes all of the documentaries you could hope for.  If you are a cult fan of this film, you owe it to yourself to get this edition.  If you're just looking for a great Bond film, look elsewhere.  And whatever you do, don't watch it after watching THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  Trust me.",1175299200,,5587,4.661554192229039
1399037,3,B000056OCJ,"This motion picture hit the theaters on June 29 1979 Starring: Roger Moore as James Bond, Lois Chiles as Dr. Holly Goodhead, Michael Lonsdale as Hugo Drax and Richard Kiel as Jaws. Agent 007 James Bond blast into orbit in this action packed adventure that takes him to Venice, Rio de Janeiro and Outer Space.

Summary: When Bond investigates the hijacking of Moonraker, which was piggyback on an American Space Shuttle, he and the beautiful CIA Agent Dr. Holly Goodhead are soon locked in a life or death struggle. The person there struggling with is Hugo Drax, a power mad industrial whose horrified scheme may cause people to reshape there lives. The picture opens with the shuttle riding piggyback when the engine fires and it takes of on its own. James is shown to be in a private plane when he's left by himself as the man and lady that were with him, shootout the plane instruments before bailing out. Therefore, Bond jumps out of the plane after and goes after the man that has the parachute. Both Bond and the man he's after fight over the parachute as they fall through the sky heading for land. James is summoned by the British Prime Minister to find out what happen to Moonraker. Therefore, Bond leaves the office and goes to California where he's met by a helicopter who takes Bond to Hugo Drax place of training. After a meeting with Drax, Bond is given a tour of the grounds. After his tour, Bond is taken and introduce to Dr. Holly Goodhead and she process to take Bond to see Moonraker. Drax tells his supervisor to make sure some harm comes to Bond. Bond is put into a machine by Dr. Goodhead that can reach 20G, which could kill you. When Dr Goodhead is call up by Mr. Drax, Drax hit-man takes over the experiment. As the supervisor takes control of the instruments he starts to make the machine go faster and faster. The only way for Bond to get the machine to slow down is to shootout the instruments. Later that night Bond charms his way into the Drax office where he unlocks the safe and takes pictures of plans that he found in Drax presents. The next day, Drax invites Bond to go on a pheasant hunt where Bond first shot takes down a pheasant. However, the price for one of the employees who help Bond could be costly. The role of Drax was first offered to James Mason who turned it down. In the picture The Spy Who Loved Me, Lois Chiles was offered the part to play Russian Agent Anya but turned it down because she wanted to cut back on her workload. Some parts of the picture where shot in different locations such as the Rockwell International Manufacturing Assembly Plant in Palmdale California. The other location that was used for this picture was the Vehicle Assembly Building in Cape Canaveral in Florida. This was the fourth film in which roger Moore was used as James Bond and the second one that the opening scene was shot with Bond using a parachute. This was the first movie that featured a space shuttle. The release of this film was suppose to be around the time the NASA was going to release its first ever shuttle launch into outer space. In order to create the final shot in which the space station is destroyed, the visual effects crew locked themselves in the studio and shot the model of the space station to pieces using shotguns. When work on the film began, NASA had in fact not yet officially finalized the design of the Space Shuttle. Fortunately, for the production designers, there were subsequently no visible changes made to the shuttle's design, making their rendering of it accurate.

As far as my thoughts on this movie? I didn't think that this picture had attention grabber that the others did. Even though I thought Lois Chilies was good she didn't have the glamor that some of the other Bond picture did. Barbara Bach would have done so much to the role of Bonds leading woman if she would have been given a chance. Overall, this movie didn't have the suspense the others had so I give this movie 6 weasel stars.",1174176000,,3974,4.518055555555556
1399038,3,B000056OCJ,"Roger Moore had his ups and downs as James Bond.  After an excellent entry in the series with ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" ""Moonraker"" was another weak entry.  The fault this time lies with the far too science fiction outer space shootout that finishes the movie, a reprise of the underwater battle from ""Thunderball"" in combination with a bit of ""Star Wars"" Death Star destruction.

The basic concept is similar to many of the previous Bond films that have worked so well.  Hugo Drax, effectively played by Michael Lonsdale, has a plan for (what else) conquering the world.  Lonsdale is one of the most superb Bond villains ever, easily surpassing Ernst Stavro Blofeld and in the same league as Christopher Lee.  Lonsdale is one of the most coldly calculating megalomaniacs to ever menace the world in the Bond series, and his only error is to dismiss Bond too readily.

Lonsdale's plan is quite complex, and involves choosing ""perfect"" human specimens to transport into space, and then cleverly eliminating the rest of mankind.  How does he do all this?  You must watch and see.  Obviously space shuttles are involved and a clever plan for killing all the humans remaining on Earth.

One thing I've wondered about in some of Roger Moore's Bond movies is why the bad guys are good at what they do and the good guys are not all that good, or perhaps effective.  This time Hugo Drax is supported by Richard Kiel as Jaws, Corinne Clery as Corinne Dufour and Toshir Suga as Chang.  All these actors and actresses are competent and intelligent.  Bond, on the other hand, seems to get people who appear to be amateurs or think he is bumbling.  Makes you want to be on the side of the bad guys.  Admittedly, two of Drax' key personnel end up helping Bond, but I still wonder why the good guys can't get better help.

As I mentioned before, the final portion of the movie takes place in space, so you can guess that this film is loaded with technology and gadgets.  In another reprise we see Bond in a boat chase through the canals of Venice, a chase that includes a gondola being cut in half similar to the boat chase in ""The Man with the Golden Gun.""  Bond's gondola turns out to be loaded with nifty extras, of course.  Later Bond gets another cool boat in South America.  This boat includes torpedoes, mines, and a built-in hang glider.  The boat itself looks very high tech.  We also see lasers quite a bit in this film.  Similar to the science fantasy movie ""Star Wars,"" the laser beams are visible.  One of these days someone will make a realistic movie where the laser beams are not visible; admittedly more boring, but also more factual.

Bond movies have always had great locations, and this one meets the standard; Venice, Guatemala, Brazil, among others, and the credits list outer space.  I believe I recognized the Lancaster-Palmdale area of southern California as part of Drax' facilities for building the Moonraker shuttles.

The theme song for this movie was sung by Shirley Bassey, who also sang the theme to ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia with Love,"" and appeared as a lounge singer in the movie ""Live and Let Die.""

Even though this movie had a bit too much hokum and a wooden performance by Bond, who appeared to be bored much of the time, there is still a lot to like about this movie.  Richard Kiel is a super-villain worthy of a super-spy.  Admittedly the jokes associated with Jaws' appearances are often corny, but Jaws is a cool, bizarre villain.  I also enjoyed Bond's escape from the cable car in Brazil.  Jaws' outfit in Carnivale was interesting and unique, and fitted his personality well.  I really enjoyed the fight between Chang and Bond in the glass shop in Venice.  The fight between Chang and Bond in the warehouse is an (inadvertent?) homage to Bruce Lee's ""Game of Death.""  There are quite a few other worthwhile scenes.

It's hard to rate this movie higher than three stars because of the flaws and Moore's rather weak performance.  However, it is a Bond movie, and always worth a bowl of popcorn.  I recommend this movie for fans of Bond and for those who like cheesy science fiction or science fantasy films.  Movies like these typically do not win many awards, but they sure are fun to watch.

1399040,3,B000056OCJ,"Watching this movie again after so many years reminds me of why the new Casino Royale is such a great movie.  This movie is pure James Bond Cheese.  The story is simple.  A billionaire has built a space station and wants to destroy the earth.  This is a James Bond movie so I guess it won't be a spoiler if I were to say Bond saves the world and gets the girl (her name is Holly Goodhead.  I guess they were trying to be more suggestive than [...] Galore) in the end.

That's not to say the movie isn't a lot of fun to watch.  There are some great sequences, mostly featuring one of the best Bond Villains, Jaws.  But, in the end, even he falls in love.  This movie will be remembered as the Bond franchise attempt to cash in on the success of ""Star Wars"" as opposed to being one of the best Bond movie.  Still ""Moonraker"" is worth a look.",1168387200,,839,4.0920245398773005
1399041,3,B000056OCJ,"When a Moonraker space shuttle, on loan from the United States to England, is hijacked, Bond is called in to investigate...

Bond surely possess the latest knowledge about nuclear power and is able to fly a rocket ship... Bond's girls too have moved with the times and now join battle alongside him, fighting off the enemy with equal proficiency...

It's nice to see Bond dressed as a Brazilian gaucho, galloping up to a 16th-century Benedictine monastery, and safecracking in a magnificent French chteau...

Roger Moore is seen humorous and light hearted, gliding through St. Mark's Square in his motorized gondola... He fights with a Chinese manservant in the Venice Glass Museum with great style, and stops himself from throwing a priceless bowl valued at 1 million... He takes out one speedboat with some mines, another with a torpedo and takes off on a hang-glider as his boat goes over the falls...

Bond was initially surprised that a top rocket scientist at Drax Industries was an attractive young woman... He set aside his aggressive attitudes when he realized that not only was Holly a fully trained astronaut on loan from NASA--she was also a CIA agent... She liked better working alone and he had to exhaust himself to win her over...

The eleventh Bond film seems to recycle a number of elements familiar from earlier adventures, most obviously Stromberg's hired killer, Jaws, played once again by Richard Kiel... Hugo Drax, the vengeful ex-Nazi of Fleming's novel, is reinvented as a psychotic who is obsessed with the conquest of space, and plans to wipe out the globe's population with a powerful type of nerve gas... His plan for mass murder completed, Drax will then repopulate the planet with his own master race... His fleet of shuttles--the Moonrakers--which are based in South America, will transport his master race into space... There they will live on a radar-invisible space station until Earth's depopulation has been completed...

Drax likes to play a little Chopin on his grand black piano, and enjoys a cucumber sandwich... His vanity leads him to control his ferocious hounds by the click of his fingers... He brings from France every block of stone used on his California residence... According to his charming pilot, ""What he doesn't own, he doesn't want!"" and, like Auric Goldfinger, affects a desire to play English country sports...

Michael Lonsdale's performance is astonishingly controlled and precise as Hugo Drax... There's something really scary about his true personality and character... He gives sarcastic remarks about 007: 'You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season.' 'At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery!' 'Mr. Bond, you persist in defying my efforts to provide an amusing death for you.'

Jaws returns in ""Moonraker"" and adds some tension to the film... Richard Kiel has become something of a cult figure since his appearance in 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. He reappears as indestructible as ever... He impersonates Christopher Lee in Dracula mode, and has an entirely different trip down a mountain... His little scenes with a cute little blonde girl are very sweet... His despairing search for her on the disintegrating space station is wonderful... The bitter little smile he and Bond share as they prepare for their set-to atop the cable car is inspired...

Corinne Dufour (Corinne Clery) becomes one of Bond's early bedmates... Corinne is Hugo Drax's beautiful helicopter pilot and executive assistant... Unfortunately, in Drax's eyes, her amorous byplay with Bond also marks her for early elimination...

Sadly, 'Moonraker' would mark the end of Bernard Lee's 45-year film career... Already visibly frail, Lee would succumb to stomach cancer; he died in London's Royal Free Hospital on 16 January 1981... Although he made a notable contribution to such outstanding mystery dramas as Carol Reed's 'The Third Man,' and Basil Dearden's 'The Blue Lamp,' it is for his definitive 'M' that he will be remembered...",1168214400,,4010,5.1271056661562024

James Bond was high there on my list. The first 45 minutes of MOONRAKER was the closest that the Roger Moore Bonds had ever come to the look and feel of the James Bond films of the 60s. It was really incredible. Equally incredible was how the film did a flip-flop into slapstick when Bond is floating down that canal in Venice. As the film progressed the level of slapstick escalated. It was just plain out ridicules. The film was very annoying.

I thought Roger Moore had finally combined his best qualities as a personality and an actor to represent James Bond in this film. His scene in the centrifuge showed his ability to bring depth to the character in a very credible way. This one scene is a standout because it equals any performance given by any of the actors that have portrayed James Bond in this series. Christopher Wood, given sole screenplay credit this time, delivered a script full of witty dialogue. The free-fall pre-credit sequence with John Barry's background score, incredible stunt work and cinematography was excellent. With so many fine elements at their peak of perfection it was a shame that the film unraveled in so many different directions.

When I saw this film on opening day I remembered how the whole lobby was crammed with people. As I sat during the film I remember a little boy who was sitting in front of me turn around and look at his father. ""Daddy I really like this movie."" I never forgot that.

The movie is filled with problems. Roger Moore sleepwalks his way in his performance. Lois Chiles (Dr. Holly Goodhead) is one of the dullest Bond girls of all times. Michael Lonsdale (Drax) is a brilliant actor, but in this movie he appears bored. The storyline of Richard Kiel (Jaws) finding a girlfriend was so corny I could not believe it. And the space fight scene at the end was hilarious in the worst way. Despite this, this movie was a HUGE success (thanks to the return of the character Jaws and the success of Star Wars, which this film ripped off) and is considered the quintessential Bond film.

A total rehashing of the plot from The Spy Who Loved Me by Christopher Wood, only this time instead of destroying mankind and rebuilding a world under the sea, Hugo Drax is going to destroy the Earth and rebuild his uber-society in outer space.  Big deal.

Plenty of cleavage, jokes, gadgets, exotic locales that make almost no sense to be going to, and Roger Moore jokesy one-liners abound.

Lois Chiles makes a typical Bond-girl, in a bad way. Although a CIA agent (better looking than Felix Leiter), she apparently has very little to offer in the brains or attack-defense departments.  As for acting, she gets 2/5 stars, and that is probably being generous.

Richard Kiel as Jaws is reduced to a buffoon compared to the menace he portrayed in The Spy Who Loved Me.  No wonder we never saw his character again.  Who could take him seriously after this?

Michael Lonsdale, although a fine actor whom I've seen give some very good performances, basically sleep-walks through almost the entire film.  He appears to have been too heavily medicated.  It is only when he yells, ""Jaws!  You obey me!"" that we see any life out of the man.

1399047,2,B000056OCJ,"Just as it was possible to find people in the early '40s who would jump up and declare how Hitler wasn't THAT bad, if the world would just give him a chance, there ARE -- unbelievably -- people who will tell you how ""Moonraker"" isn't really THAT bad a Bond movie . . . if only you give it a chance.

Well, the ""Moonraker"" apologists are wrong.  It IS that bad.  I just watched it last night, for the first time in probably fifteen years, and boy howdy, is it bad.  I'm being incredibly generous and giving it two stars, and here's why it gets that much credit: (1) a generally great John Barry score, (2) some lovely locations, and (3) a genuinely terrific pre-credits skydiving stunt.

Now, on to the bad.

(1)  Lois Chiles gives one of the most wooden performances of the entire series.  She is AWFUL.  Roger Moore is not at his finest, but he gives a performance worthy of a Nobel prize in comparison to Chiles.

(2)  Michael Lonsdale, so great in ""Munich"" decades later, is almost as wooden a villain as Chiles is a heroine.  ZERO charm, ZERO menace.

(3)  Jaws.  Jaws, Jaws, Jaws . . . what an awful henchman.  I know people like him, but I don't care.  He's silly.  The subplot involving his girlfriend is one of the lamest things ever to appear in an A-list movie.  He was bad in ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" but here, he's abominable.

(4)  A completely nonsensical plot.  So full of holes that the screenplay could be a colander.

Even more points off for the DVD, which includes another commentary by the evil trio of producer Michael Wilson, director Lewis Gilbert, and writer Christopher Wood, all of whom seem quite pleased with themselves.

It's for no good reason, I assure you.",1158105600,,1688,4.4411764705882355
1399048,3,B000056OCJ,"Roger Moore had his ups and downs as James Bond. After an excellent entry in the series with ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" ""Moonraker"" was another weak entry. The fault this time lies with the outer space shootout that finishes the movie, a reprise of the underwater battle from ""Thunderball"" in combination with a bit of ""Star Wars"" Death Star destruction.

The basic concept is similar to many of the previous Bond films that have worked so well. Hugo Drax, effectively played by Michael Lonsdale, has a plan for (what else) conquering the world. Lonsdale is one of the most superb Bond villains ever, easily surpassing Ernst Stavro Blofeld and in the same league as Christopher Lee. Lonsdale is one of the most coldly calculating megalomaniacs to ever menace the world in the Bond series, and his only error is to dismiss Bond too readily.

Lonsdale's plan is quite complex, and involves choosing ""perfect"" human specimens to transport into space and then cleverly eliminating the rest of mankind. How does he do all this? You must watch and see. Obviously space shuttles are involved and a clever plan for killing all the humans remaining on Earth.

One thing I've wondered about in some of Roger Moore's Bond movies is why the bad guys are good at what they do and the good guys are not all that good, or perhaps effective. This time Hugo Drax is supported by Richard Kiel as Jaws, Corinne Clery as Corinne Dufour and Toshir Suga as Chang. All these actors and actresses are competent and intelligent. Bond, on the other hand, seems to get people who appear to be amateurs, or think Bond is bumbling. Makes you want to be on the side of the bad guys. Admittedly, two of Drax's key personnel end up helping Bond, but I still wonder why the good guys can't get better help.

As I mentioned before, the final portion of the movie takes place in space, so you can guess that this film is loaded with technology and gadgets. In another reprise we see Bond in a boat chase through the canals of Venice, a chase that includes a gondola being cut in half similar to the boat chase in ""The Man with the Golden Gun."" Bond's gondola turns out to be loaded with nifty extras, of course. Later Bond gets another cool boat in South America. This boat includes torpedoes, mines, and a built-in hang glider. The boat itself looks very high tech. We also see lasers quite a bit in this film. Similar to the science fantasy movie ""Star Wars,"" the laser beams are visible. One of these days someone will make a realistic movie where the laser beams are not visible; admittedly more boring, but also more factual.

Bond movies have always had great locations, and this one meets the standard; Venice, Guatemala, Brazil, among others, and the credits list outer space. I believe I recognized the Lancaster-Palmdale area of southern California as part of Drax's facilities for building the Moonraker shuttles.

The theme song for this movie was sung by Shirley Bassey, who also sang the theme to ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia with Love,"" and appeared as a lounge singer in the movie ""Live and Let Die.""

Even though this movie had a bit too much hokum and a wooden performance by Bond, who appeared to be bored much of the time, there is still a lot to like about this movie. Richard Kiel is a super-villain worthy of a super-spy. Admittedly the jokes associated with Jaws's appearances are often corny, but Jaws is a cool, bizarre villain.

The scenery is amazing in typical Bond fashion and as far as the action goes there is a lot to like about this film. As far as the plot is concerned it is as credible as any Bond film out there except for the last 20 minutes. If you just sit back and roll with it the ending is not that bad. The Bond franchise was capitalizing off the success of other science fiction films of that era and really the last few scenes are right in line with some other famous films of that time.

Although this is not my favorite Roger Moore era Bond film, I like The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only better, Moonraker has its moments, there is a lot to like here. I know for those critical of this film there is a lot to find fault with, but I think that the positives clearly outweigh the negatives here.

The Moonraker soundtrack is outstanding and quite possibly one of the very best of the series.",1150416000,,1052,4.177339901477833
1399051,3,B000056OCJ,"Ah, Moonraker...the most hated of Bond films. It has been almost fashionable to rip this movies as the dregs of the core 16 Bond films {not counting Never Say Never and the Brosnan abominations!!!} In truth Moonraker is a lot better than people give it credit for.

I think a different ratings system is required for the Bond films. I divide the core 16 Bond films in two categories:

Category 1- the realistic, Ian Fleming based films {Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, OHMSS, For Your Eyes Only, Living Daylights, License to Kill}

Category 2- the outlandish, campish, action films {You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever, Live and Let Die, Man With the Golden Gun, Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, Octopussy, View to a Kill}

Bond films can be enjoyable in both categories. But in viewing and judging ""Moonraker"", you can;t judge it the same way you would a Category 1 movie. Your going to have to put on your Category 2 hat to rate Moonraker. In general to enjoy any of the 16 Bond films your going to have to appreciate and understand the two categories I mentioned above.

Moonraker is essentially another version of ""Spy who Loved me"". An absurdist fantasy about a superspy stopping a meglomaniac from destroying the world.

The Good:

1. The movie does for space what Thunderball did for underwater and OHMSS did for snow. You really get a feel of the majesty of space, the romnance of space and just how really amazing it is that man has gone into space. The feeling is expressed in nearly every way from the music to the setting of the pieces.

2. Without a doubt, the BEST opening teaser of all the Bonds. I didn;t think anything could top ""Spy Who Loved Me"" , but the Moonraker does it. Even the Jaws antics don't take away from the suspense and real danger of a person falling in the air without a parachute.

3. Most underrated Bond theme. Shirley Bassey really shows how much depth of emotion she has in rendering this lovely ballad!. The slow pacing seems to complement the visuals and the overall space theme of the movie. Mr. Barry's score during the space sequences are wonderful and almost reminiscent of

4. Hugo Drax is a far superior villain to ""Spy""'s Stromberg. Darax gives the feel of a child prodigy gone wrong. Much more of a prescence than Stromberg. I absolutely loved the scene with Drax playing piano while waiting for Bond.

5. Some very good action sequences from the  attempted assasination with the ""Centrifuge"", the attack in warehouse. Even upon watching this movie again, I noticed that the space sequences were very good and still were pretty exciting.

6. One of the most useful and practical of bond gadgets--the wrist shooter. Hell who wouldn;t have a use for something like that!!!

The bad

1. Holly Goodhead just doesn;t equal up to Major Amosova in ""Spy""

2. The entire Venice speedboat scene turns out to be more hokey than action packed. The hydro-gondala was just ridiculous

3. Depending on your tolerance the Jaws antics may be too goofy or ridiculous. Personally, I always felt that Jaws was a cartoon character, so why not go all the way and make him a complete cartoon.

4. The script and writing is not as tight and together as it was on ""Spy"". Too many wasted opportunities. Too many times where it seems as if Bond is stumbling into the plot rather than figuring it out.

In a nutshell, Moonraker is ""Spy Who Loved Me"" in space, but with somewhat weaker elements.",1135296000,,3442,4.65016501650165
1399052,4,B000056OCJ,"Bond in space?  Hell, Jason and the Leprechaun did it, why not?  Moonraker, an attempt to cash in on Star Wars fever, is considered by many to be the worst Bond film.  Definitely not true, don't believe any schmuck who tries to feed you that line.  For the worst Bond films, the last three with Brosnan flicks win that title.  At least you can laugh at the silliness of Moonraker.  Bond doesn't even make it to outer space until an hour and a half through the film.  For 90 minutes he's trying to investigate the disappearance of the ""Moonraker"" shuttle that  the RAF was supposed to be protecting.  He's pursued by the villain's henchmen as well as Jaws, who's now sort of a Wile E. Coyote character.  Lois Chiles is the rather cold Bond girl.  I don't know why, but I find her the hottest of any girl I've ever seen in a Bond film......and she does the whole film fully clothed pretty much.  I think it's that voice of hers-HOTT!  And of course she's very pretty.  The reason Bond goes into outer space anyway is coz our multigazillionaire(naturally) villain plans on destroying the world from his space station and repopulating it with a superior race of humans.  Naturally it makes sense that Bond would have to go into space to catch this guy.  It's really not as ridiculous as you may think.  Sure it's ridiculous, but since DR. No. you've had to suspend your disbelief where Bond is concerned.  Is is easier to accept a man in an underwater fortress plotting to destroy mankind to build an underwater city?  Or a rocket snatching vehicle housed in a lair inside a volcano?  Or Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist?  You've always been expected to suspend disbelief, Moonraker just asks you to suspend it a tad more.  The film is a bit sillier than the average Bond with the one-liners, Jaws' antics, and a laser battle that looks like it comes from a Buck Rogers episode more than it does Star Wars.  But hey, it's only one in a large series of films, and I certainly have no trouble enjoying it for what it is.  Hopefully you can too.",1133568000,,2044,4.491847826086956
1399063,4,B000056OCJ,"When I was growing up, in a time before you could buy movies on VHS, we looked forward each week to see what the big Saturday night movie was going to be on ABC.  When it came to Bond, 9 times out of 10 it was either GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, LIVE AND LET DIE, or MOONRAKER.

So, it is more than likely that my love for this movie is based on a nostalgic remberance of my childhood days gone by.  Whatever it is, I have a very fond place in my heart for this movie.

Let's be honest - it's a very silly movie.  The plot is lifted almost entirely from SPY WHO LOVED ME, in that a maniac is stealing space shuttles with the intent of carting himself and a collection of perfect people to a space station, from which he will rain down a fatal chemical that will kill all humans, and then he and his ""colony"" can come back down and repopulate the earth.  Yeah - stupid plot!  And yes, this movie was largely a response to the space-craze STAR WARS had kicked up, as well as a continuation of the big-budget hike that began with SPY WHO LOVED ME.  So, we have ALOT of action and effects, the return of the favorite henchman (Jaws), and space battles to boot!

But, even with all this silliness, there is still alot of good moments in the film.  Bond does not actually go to space until the last 30 minutes of the movie.  So there as alot of down-to-earth fun beforehand.  We get the thrilling opening piece involving Bond being pushed out of a plane without a parachute.  A pulse-pounding fight atop a sky-tram.  A cool gadget filled boat chase, and Bond just being Bond all the while.

As for the space stuff - well, it isn't completely inconceivable that Bond might hitch a ride on a Space Shuttle.  But of course, the idea that he is suddenly suited for Space Travel, can fly a Space Shuttle, that the millitary can be ready to launch yet another shuttle full of troops armed with laser guns just moments after Bond notifies them of the Space Station's location . . . yeah, it's pretty far-fetched.  But so is most of the series, is it not?  Just detach a bit and enjoy.

The Bond girl is a mixture of attractiveness and smarts - she's more resourceful than she is sexy - but she is also a good actress, so no worries there.  The villain is serviceable, not really memorable in the sea of Bond Baddies, but also a decent actor.

MAD MAGAZINE had it right when they titled their spoof MONEYRAKER - it is designed to hit hard at the box office (which it apparently did).  But it's still a fun Bond outing, and FAR from Moore's worst (that dubious honor goes to OCTOPUSSY and VIEW TO A KILL).",1125273600,,2586,4.277777777777778
1399064,2,B000056OCJ,"Easily the most ambitious, overblown Bond yet produced. ""Moonraker"" stands as an example of why filmakers should not try to jump on the latest trend to help sell their movie to the public.

Cashing in on the ""Star Wars"" theme, ""Moonraker"" begins with the theft of a space shuttle on loan from America to Britain and our man Bond must track across three continents in search of its wherabouts. He quickly meets the shuttle's manufacturer, Drax, who is instantly recognizable as the villian of this film. But Bond apparently has a lot of frequent flyer miles to use up, so he jaunts around the globe with ""Jaws"" from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" in full pursuit.  Eventually, Bond finds Drax's immense shuttle base and launches himself to the bad guy's space station.  Can Bond stop Drax from killing every human on the planet? Well, yes he can, but I suppose that really isn't giving away too much.

The problems with this film are almost too numerous to mention.

The acting is pretty bad, especially Michael Lonsdale's Drax who's flat, monotone delivery sounds pretty much like the ""countdown guy"" from ""Diamonds Are Forever"".

There are plot holes and voids of logic large enough to fly a space shuttle through.  Questions that instantly pop to mind when watching this flick include;

- Why would a shuttle riding piggy-back on a 747 be fully fueled?

- Why does the pilot take the time to shoot out the control panel of the plane, yet not bother to shoot Bond.

- If the ""radar jamming"" device indeed keeps the space station ""stealthy"" from radar tracking stations (which it wouldn't, but that's beside the point), you can still certainly SEE the station.  Considering that the international space station is visible from Earth, I would think Drax's creation would be even moreso.

- Speaking of the space station, why waste billions of dollars to create something so impractical to Drax's evil plan? Why not just build a large, underground chamber to keep the ""nubile youth"" safe and use lots of small rockets to deliver the toxin around the Earth?

The film also has a poor mix of comedy and action as ""Jaws"" (clearly an inspiration for the ""Terminator"") really plays second fiddle here and apparently redeems himself in the eyes of Bond despite killing countless people.  Bond's love interest, ""Dr. Goodhead"" (perhaps the most juvenile name in the history of the Bond series) is completely uninteresting and while the lack of women in bikinis may be a nod to feminism, it does leave the film rather ""lacking"" in eye candy.

""Moonraker"" is not the sole source, but you can see where Mike Meyers got some of his inspiration for the ""Austin Powers"" series from this film.

Having said all that, there are a few highlights.  In particular the exciting skydiving scene and the gondola chase (which is nearly note for note copied from the boat chase in ""Man with the Golden Gun"") ends with a delightfully insane sequence where the gondola Bond is in transforms into a hovercraft and zips through the streets of Venice. While most of the ""reaction"" shots are pretty standard (gawking faces), the one from a dog is absolutely priceless and got howls of laughter from the theatre audience I sat with during its original release.

And I must point out that ""Moonraker"" is the only Bond film that is set in the near-future.  After all, the space shuttle was two years away from flying into orbit at the time and we still haven't created a laser pistol like we see in the film.

Overall, I cannot recommend ""Moonraker"" as entertainment, but it may be useful to filmakers as an example of how big budgets and efforts at following trends can ruin an otherwise decent idea.

Personal Note: I saw this film when it opened in 1979 on a ""Cinarama"" screen (a screen so wide it actually was curved to handle 70mm projections) at a theatre called ""The Continental"", which has long since been torn down.",1124755200,,3881,4.736998514115899
1399065,5,B000056OCJ,"This screen is starting to look like the metaphorical equivalent of the sweet space battle at the end of this breathtaking achievement of cinematic perfection. Well, I'm here to shoot a few of my own lasers now, this movie totally kicks a$$. Let's start with the opening song, which I think is easily in the top 3 of all time best Bond openers.

So there's this frog named Drax who wants to kill everyone on Earth, and start from scratch with his own breeding stock of beautiful people. The genocide of the ugly people of Earth comes by virtue of a space delivered disease, or nerve agent, or something equally superfluous, which Drax of course also manufactures.

I have a theory which goes a little something like this: When a man reaches a certain level of wealth, he naturally begins to contemplate some dimension of world conquest. The uber-villains Bond is often pitted against seem to pan this theory out nicely, begging the question, when will 007 take on Dick Cheney, Bill Gates, or Ronald McDonald?

So in comes old pervy Bond to salivate all over the dames, karate chop some mouth brething henchmen, and get all up in Drax's grille. Drax, for is his part, is no sllouch though. The man is straight evil, but his taste in women, crib's, and lasers is beyond reproach. I suppose because I grew up with Roger Moore playing Bond, I get the best of both worlds, because Connery and Moore are both Bond to me.

Now, in a movie which already has so much to offer the entertainment starved masses, we see the return of super hencmen JAWS. That alone should raise a pulse or two, because this guy is emma effin indestrutable. You can shoot him in the face, throw him out of an airplane, drop him in a tank full of ill tempered sharks, drop his a$$ from outerspace, and he doesn't die. Why can't we unleash this cat in Iraq?

So anyway, Bond figures Drax out, and its on. As I have previously alluded to, there is a magnificent space battle involving cats floating around in space shooting lasers, and invading space stations like that's all they got paid to do. Wow, if it get's any better than this they'll start taxing us for it.",1124668800,,2133,4.515544041450777
1399066,4,B000056OCJ,"The year 1979 was a big year for science fiction.  Eager to cash in on the continuing success of STAR WARS, MOONRAKER went all out for a taste of that sci-fi fun, and what fun it was!  This is my second favorite BOND after THUNDERBALL.

It was great to see Jaws again in this one.  The plot and the villian are just as implausible as any other BOND movie before it, but you presume to check your intelligence in-at-the-door before you watch any BOND movie, so hey, why not?  This movie also introduced the space shuttle design to audiences before it officially lifted off for the first time in 1981.

In a year that also saw ALIEN, THE BLACK HOLE and STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, MOONRAKER fit in quite nicely.",1124064000,,712,4.396946564885496
1399067,3,B000056OCJ,"Even though Roger Moore is my favorite Bond, I can't defend this mess. The only standout is the villian Hugo Drax. He clearly stole the show. After a thrilling opening this movie goes downhill in a hurry. If not for Die another Day, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is not Enough, this would be the worst in the series.",1123545600,,320,4.35
1399068,3,B000056OCJ,"I was vacationing in Europe earlier this summer, and a brief tour through Venice (complete with Gondola ride) prompted me to dig up my Moonraker DVD when I got home. Venice is of course one of the locations Bond visits this time around, along with Rio de Janeiro and finally, outer space.

I call this the most ambitious Bond movie ever, because even the newest Brosnan installments, for all their heavy action and effects, haven't launched Bond into outer space. All things considered, it's handled rather well. The space romp is only the last portion of the film, and the build-up to it is as realistic as one could expect from a Bond adventure. It also helps that the special effects hold up well, not quite ""Star Wars"" level but still rather impressive. The only silliness is the space marines, but what's a Bond film without a final epic brawl between the good guys and bad guys?

It's pretty much the non-space parts of the film that fall flat. Mainly, Moonraker is a rehash of The Spy Who Loved Me, the film before it. The plot and pacing is pretty much the same, except the threat has moved from underwater to outer space. The Bond girls are flat and unmemorable, and Roger Moore's acting feels stale and lifeless. If he'd projected the same energy and charm as in the movies before and after Moonraker, this film would've been much better. The film's saving graces are the memorable pre-credits parachute sequence and the action sequences in the gondola and on the cable car.

There's a nice making-of documentary, and also a second special effects documentary which feels like a ""best-of"" piece culled from clips from the documentaries of the other Bond dvds. Otherwise, the disc isn't quite as loaded as others in the 007 series. More of a rental for non-fans, though the uniqueness of Bond in space may convince you to add it to your collection.",1121644800,,1857,4.690184049079755
1399069,2,B000056OCJ,"I am a huge fan of the Bond series. In fact I own every movie in the series, some I even have both the VHS and DVD versions. But this movie is a big pain to the series, and the only reason I have it is so that my colection can be complete. Roger Moore was a horror to the series. He and the writers at the time turned James Bond into a painful slapstick comedy series and it got worse then ever when it reached this movie. Even Jaws whom is one of my favorite villians in the series second only to Ernst Stravo Blowfeld, is annoying in this movie.

Lets start out with the basics. The movie starts out ridiculous when James Bond is pushed out of a polane and is pursued by Jaws. When Bond escapes him by stealing one of his oppenents parachutes and opening it up, Jaws tries to do the same only to realize that his chute isn't working. So what does this villian do. HE FLAPS HIS ARMS LIKE A FREAKING BIRD AND MAKES ""FUNNY"" FACES. That is not the style of Bond. That my friends is Loonet Toons.

Lets move on to one of Bonds gadget filled vehicles. No Bond movie is complete without a really cool juiced up vehicle full of gadgets from Q branch. And this one has a doozie. Thats right boys and girls ger ready for Bonds tricked out... Gondola? That's righ James Bond fight villian on a river with a super charged Gondola and to make matter worse he decieded to wear a silly hate, aint that precios. Ok I'm sorry I just thought that James Bond was supposed to have style, to make all men envy him. To me it looks like grampa forgot to take his medication.

As we move on again we come back to Jas who in this movie is probably the most annoying character seond only to James Bond. This guy cannot stop with the Looney Toones Crap. I'll just give you two situations right here and stop wit that. One James Bond is in a buileding searchign for somthing and Jaws approaches his female companion to attack her in a creepy clown costume. Ok this is good, so far this scene is playing out just right, what is she going to do, right? Well when James comes out he has a small fight with him but then Jaws is carried out with a dancing crowd, so Jaws decides that he should DANCE WITH THEM!!! Argh, no,no,no,no, that aint right. He then falls chases Bond Later in these giant air track things, I'm sorry I actually don't know what thy are called, they are like giant ski lifts. Anyways Bond escapes by using his Jacket and sliding donw the wire. Jaws chasesd him and crashes into a wall. Looney Toon sound effects and look, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA NO! Jaws is then found by a big chested girl with glasses and they fall in love. How sweet (insert sarcasm here).

I can just go on and on, the cheesy space battle, the boring main villian, Jaws's change of heart, its all so cheesy it makes me sick. You want good Bond skip this and the rest of the Roger Moore films that followed, expept for A View to A Kill because that has Christopher Walkin and that guy rules.

1399070,2,B000056OCJ,"After the rousing success (and rejuvination of the series) of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME in 1977, I was again excited by the James Bond films and looked forward to the next one.  At the end of SPY, the credits announced that the next film would be FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.

I should've known when they changed the project to MOONRAKER--to cash in on STAR WARS--it was an ominous sign.

The opening action sequence is the best part of the movie, an ""eye-popping"" stunt of Bond getting knocked out of a jet without a parachute.  It was wild and exhilirating to see in the theatre...then the rest of the movie started.

MOONRAKER almost plays like a parody, and not a very funny one.  The locations are beautiful but the story just lumbers along.  Roger Moore, who's actually a couple of years older than Sean Connery, looked like 007 in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (I've seen photos of his 50th birthday party while shooting that film), but he really began to show his age in this one (and he would go on to be in three more!).

Lois Chiles looks great but comes across as flat and embarrassed.  Michael Lonsdale is probably the most narcoleptic villian in the series.  Jaws, whose outlandish size and cartoonish teeth still managed to have some menace in SPY, is strictly played for laughs.

I'm a huge James Bond fan, but I still know when one is working and when it isn't.  No matter how millions it makes.",1109894400,,1389,4.446640316205533

This movie also takes the prize for most egregious product placements. Defintely Moore's worst outing, who would have known he would come back for his best two years later in ""For Your Eyes Only.""

Bond goes to Drax's palace in France where he meets his Drax's beautiful mistress Corinne Clery, who has a stunning figure in her low-cut dress.

Her murder at the hands of Drax, as a punishment for helping Bond, shows the cruelty of Drax.

Drax had Corinne savaged by his vicious Dobermans. Though I never like it when the bond girls are murdered. I always prefer them to be rescued, as is the gorgeous sultry Brazilian Manuela (Emily Bolton) who has a close run-in with Jaws ( Richard Kiel)

He also runs into Drax's thug Chang (Toshiro Shuga) who fails to exterminate Bond, and ends up the worse for it.

And it gets worse - in Brazil Jaws meets Dolly and )okay its too painful to go on). Suffice to say the movie makers bowed to audience pressure to turn Jaws into a goodie and in doing so eliminated any menace the character had not just in this movie but in its brilliant iconic predecessor The Spy Who Loved Me.
Indeed this movie seems to be an attempt to remake The Spy Who Loved Me which was in fact a remake of You Only Live Twice. One bright spot this movie does hold is the always enjoyable and watchable Michael Lonsdale as Drax. Lonsdale gives us probably the best villain since Auric Goldfinger with some wonderful lines - Like a lord of the Manor with ""May I press you to a cucumber sandwich?"" to the classic instruction to Chan ""Look after Mr. Bond, make sure some harm comes to him!""

1399087,4,B000056OCJ,"Reviewers unfairly criticize this film as being one of the worst Bond movies ever. I find it hard to believe that this film could be worst than the Timothy Dalton films or ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" Even in Moore's career as Bond, this movie is hardly as shallow as ""Live and Let Die."" As a matter of fact, this movie is no more a leap in imagination than ""The Spy Who Loved Me""; indeed, it's pretty much the same story except that space shuttles disappear instead of nuclear submarines: both Stromberg and Drax had the same plan of creating a new world and a master race.

Reviewers who bash on this film as being too futuristic with credibility gaps are either irrational; blind hippocrites; or simply lack the courage of admitting that they don't like Roger Moore in the role of Bond. I mean please, as if space capsules gobbling each other to land into a volcano base in Connery's 'You Only Live Twice' is credible but space shuttles flying to an orbitting space station isn't? The last I heard, space capsules upon reentry have almost no propulsion and simply splash into an ocean with a parachute: they don't land vertically with reverse thrusters to fit nicely into a narrow volcano chimney like a car backing into a cozy garage.  Is Moonraker's space station any less credible than Stromberg's submersible city and tankerhip in 'The Spy Who Loved Me'? Are the laser guns in 'Moonraker' any less credible and entertaining than those of SPECTER and Scaramanga in 'Diamonds are Forever' and 'The Man With The Golden Gun'?  As far as gadgets go, Bond's dart wrist watch in 'Moonraker' is probably one of the most credible gadgets presented throughout the entire franchise! Finally, in terms of special effects and their realism, it's completely ludicrous on the part of some reviewers to bash this film for its effects and at the same time praise Connery films in which the technologies depicted are horribly obsolete and the special effects for them even more so.

This is perhaps a good place to reveal to such snobbish Bond fans pontificating about how 'Moonraker' went overboard into fantasy about some basic premises in storytelling and film types.  First of all, the entire idea of Bond as a story format is complete fantasy from the get-go: Bond films were never intended to be 'realistic' and always remained more in the domain of a humorous action-fantasy genre: otherwise it would be fictional suspense-drama and we have Tom Clancy's novels for such a substitute.  That's what happens when you define your main character with super-hero-like nerves of steel who seemingly knows everything about everything and goes through the story in over-the-top action sequences involving submarine cars and countless other far-fetched gadgets no nation's intelligence service could ever have no matter how advanced their defense technology might be.  Such a plot and theme take a story outside of plausible fiction (i.e. action-drama or tragedy) and into the domain of action/fantasy.  'Star Wars' isn't a proper comparison with this film because Star Wars, although also fantasy, is more specifically science-fiction fantasy as opposed to strict action-fantasy: therefore even further removed from any resemblance to reality.  Almost all of the Bond films have been in the range of action-fantasy with the exception of perhaps 'Dr. No'; 'From Russia..'; 'Live and Let Die'; 'For Your Eyes..'; 'Octopussy'; and 'The Living Daylights'; that tended to come closer towards a standard adventure/action theme and plot structure.  This being said, I suggest to those narrative-illiterate reviewers who want Bond to be less fantasy and more realistic to stop torturing themselves with their distorted narrative expectations.  They just need to switch their allegiances to Jack Ryan's character of Tom Clancy's more realistic novels and films instead so as not to disappoint themselves when watching fantasy-action films such as James Bond.

As for 'Moonraker', I thought the cinematography was great and the action sequences fun: yes, perhaps Jaws becomes a little too indestructible in this film but, again, that's why James Bond is in the domain of action-fantasy as opposed to action-drama or tragedy. Overall, the humor is just as crisp and dry as all of the Moore films. So to those of you who aren't in conflict with the fantasy spy genre, buy or rent this film and have a great time in watching Bond's outer-space escapades with all of the quips, Bond Bunnies, and high-tech action adventures that make this film franchise one of the most loved and watched in the entire world.",1091491200,,4587,5.036939313984169

 For Your Eyes Only was touted as the follow up to The Spy Who Loved Me,but Moonraker, with it's Sci-Fi  elements, was chosen instead due to the boom that Star Wars spearheaded. James Bond investigates a missing space shuttle with the help of undercover CIA agent Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles).The trail leads to the shuttles builder Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) who intends on destroying the world to re-populate it with the perfect human speciman.

 Bond goes into space where it ends with a sci fi battle in the lines of Star Wars. Returning from TSWLM is Jaws (Richard Kiel),this time to fall in love and switch sides. Although the hokey space battles sticks in most brains,Moonraker boast many memorable scenes including the pre credit skydive,two boat chases,and a fight in a room full of glass.

1399099,3,B000056OCJ,"In the 60's, the James Bond team were innovators who inspired a slew of imitations, everything from Dean Martin's Matt Helm movies and TV's ""Man from U.N.C.L.E"" to Richard Burton's anti-Bond in ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold."" But as the 70's dawned, Bond was showing signs of fatigue. With 1979's ""Moonraker,"" 007 admitted defeat to the science-fiction boom led by ""Star Wars,"" a film whose special-effects team included John Stears who won an Oscar for ""Thunderball,"" and became an imitator himself.
Sending her majesty's top secret service agent into space wasn't necessarily a bad idea, but it indicated that the series was repeating itself, exhuming ideas leftover from ""You Only Live Twice"" (in which Bond almost became Buck Rogers). Worst of all, it acknowledged that the cutting edge in the cinema of the fantastic no longer belonged to 007 but to ""Star Wars,"" a film that would lead to a series that rivaled Bond at the ticket windows. (The Bond team had already acknowledged the emergence of Steven Spielberg by naming one of ""The Spy Who Loved Me""'s villains after the killer shark blockbuster of 1975, and Richard Kiel's reappearance here is another example of the series cannibalizing itself.)
What really sinks ""Moonraker"" is the humor. No longer merely tongue-in-cheek, it was now pie-in-face, a mistake the producers acknowledged themselves by returning to a more sober thriller mode for the next film (""For Your Eyes Only"") despite the fact that ""Moonraker"" became the first film in the series to surpass the record box-office take of 1965's ""Thunderball"" (which remains, as its ad campaign claimed, ""The Biggest Bond of All"" when inflation is taken into account). In addition to the dopie love interest for ""Jaws,"" the film pays humorous homage to ""The Magnificent 7"" and Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns, and the result is a Bond film that seems to be imitating Bond's own  imitators, especially the Matt Helm series.
Even though this is one of the worst Bond films, it can't be dismissed out of hand. As usual, the production values are top-flight, Roger Moore's skin was still tight (the fall became noticeable in ""Octopussy""), and John Barry's score is memorably haunting.

The basic concept is similar to many of the previous Bond films that have worked so well.  Hugo Drax, effectively played by Michael Lonsdale, has a plan for (what else) conquering the world.  Lonsdale is one of the most superb Bond villains ever, easily surpassing Ernst Stavro Blofeld and in the same league as Christopher Lee.  Lonsdale is one of the most coldly calculating megalomaniacs to ever menace the world in the Bond series, and his only error is to dismiss Bond too readily.
Lonsdale's plan is quite complex, and involves choosing ""perfect"" human specimens to transport into space, and then cleverly eliminating the rest of mankind.  How does he do all this?  You must watch and see.  Obviously space shuttles are involved and a clever plan for killing all the humans remaining on Earth.
One thing I've wondered about in some of Roger Moore's Bond movies is why the bad guys are good at what they do and the good guys are not all that good, or perhaps effective.  This time Hugo Drax is supported by Richard Kiel as Jaws, Corinne Clery as Corinne Dufour and Toshir Suga as Chang.  All these actors and actresses are competent and intelligent.  Bond, on the other hand, seems to get people who appear to be amateurs or think he is bumbling.  Makes you want to be on the side of the bad guys.  Admittedly, two of Drax' key personnel end up helping Bond, but I still wonder why the good guys can't get better help.
As I mentioned before, the final portion of the movie takes place in space, so you can guess that this film is loaded with technology and gadgets.  In another reprise we see Bond in a boat chase through the canals of Venice, a chase that includes a gondola being cut in half similar to the boat chase in ""The Man with the Golden Gun.""  Bond's gondola turns out to be loaded with nifty extras, of course.  Later Bond gets another cool boat in South America.  This boat includes torpedoes, mines, and a built-in hang glider.  The boat itself looks very high tech.  We also see lasers quite a bit in this film.  Similar to the science fantasy movie ""Star Wars,"" the laser beams are visible.  One of these days someone will make a realistic movie where the laser beams are not visible; admittedly more boring, but also more factual.
Bond movies have always had great locations, and this one meets the standard; Venice, Guatemala, Brazil, among others, and the credits list outer space.  I believe I recognized the Lancaster-Palmdale area of southern California as part of Drax' facilities for building the Moonraker shuttles.
The theme song for this movie was sung by Shirley Bassey, who also sang the theme to ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia with Love,"" and appeared as a lounge singer in the movie ""Live and Let Die.""
Even though this movie had a bit too much hokum and a wooden performance by Bond, who appeared to be bored much of the time, there is still a lot to like about this movie.  Richard Kiel is a super-villain worthy of a super-spy.  Admittedly the jokes associated with Jaws' appearances are often corny, but Jaws is a cool, bizarre villain.  I also enjoyed Bond's escape from the cable car in Brazil.  Jaws' outfit in Carnivale was interesting and unique, and fitted his personality well.  I really enjoyed the fight between Chang and Bond in the glass shop in Venice.  The fight between Chang and Bond in the warehouse is an (inadvertent?) homage to Bruce Lee's ""Game of Death.""  There are quite a few other worthwhile scenes.
It's hard to rate this movie higher than three stars because of the flaws and Moore's rather weak performance.  However, it is a Bond movie, and always worth a bowl of popcorn.  I recommend this movie for fans of Bond and for those who like cheesy science fiction or science fantasy films.  Movies like these typically do not win many awards, but they sure are fun to watch.",1073088000,,4215,4.638814016172507
1399101,3,B000056OCJ,"Looking at it objectively, this movie has a lot of the same flaws that made me positively HATE the most recent Bond film, ""Die Another Day"".  It's got a plot that's rather silly (though it's essentially the exact same plot as ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" -- a movie everyone seems to love, even as they bash this one -- it's just set in space instead of at sea), over the top stunts in a couple of scenes (the scene of the gondola turning into a hovercraft and floating through the Piazza San Marco in Venice makes me wince), and gadgets that belong more in a Star Trek movie than in a Bond film.

Yet despite all these undoubted flaws, I still love this movie.  It's hard to say why, but I imagine it's because it was the first Bond film I ever saw in the theater.  I was just a kid, fresh off Star Wars, and being a sci-fi fan, I loved it.  I suppose that fond, childhood recollection colors my view.  But having said that, this movies does have some very good points.  The heroine, Lois Chiles, is the best looking Bond girl since Claudine Auger in Thunderball, in my opinion.  The locations, particularly Venice, and the Amazon jungle, are simply breathtakingly beautiful.  The special effects, though they do occur in scenes that just don't belong in a Bond movie, are really quite good.  The villian, Hugo Drax, is the most sinister Bond villian since Blofeld, and is well acted by Michael Lonsdale.  It's got Richard Kiel as Jaws (and really, how can you not like Jaws?)  And finally, John Barry's musical score is, I think, the best he ever did for the Bond series.

So despite all the undeniable flaws, and despite the fact that I greatly prefer the earlier, more realistic Bond films from Sean Connery's run, I still can't help but like this Bond film.  It has a unique charm.",1072742400,,1780,4.436923076923077

The plot concerns ""Moonraker"" a spaceship that dissappears offradar.  007 is sent to investigate Hugo Drax, a wealthy millionaire who denies any involvement in the missing Moonraker ship.  Bond goes to Rio de Janeiro, Italy,the Amazon(which has the most beautiful waterfalls) and outer space.  The special effects and Jaws are what keeps this film alive.

1399105,4,B000056OCJ,"MOONRAKER is the name of the US space shuttle hijacked by the bad guy in this movie. Drax, played by Michel Lonsdale is a very cold, psychotic, unemotionless villain with his Japanese henchman who loves creeping about silently in the dead of night spying on 007's extra curricular activities of the amorous kind. Drax's best and thoroughly chilling line is, ""Look after Mr. Bond....see that some harm comes to him."" which he says in a very deep, flat robotic voice without a smidgeon of expression on his face. Corinne Clery is the delectable, voluptous and curvaceous French actress he dallies with. She is better known for her hot roles in other steamy movies which I confess I have never seen. Anyway, after some discussions of ""philosophy"" in the bedroom (where else), Bond extracts information among other things from her about her boss, the evil Drax. This of course displeases dastardly Drax who has her torn to pieces by his attack dogs the very next day. She had been his favourite helicopter pilot. What a way to go. I loved the character played by Lois Chiles. She is a deep cover Company (CIA) intelligence officer under official cover as a NASA space scientist on secondment to Drax Corporation. Brains, beauty and breeding; she can make technical adjustments to my space shuttle any time. 007 agrees and they ""pool their resources"" in Venice horizontally in the bedroom. As the say in Italy, Viva la Amore! The fight scene in Venice in the clock tower is superb with lots of thrills and spills. Theatrical in parts but some of the combat moves do work in real life. Needless to say, Bond despatches the Jap henchman with some good chops and I don't mean lamb chops. The short Jap assassin gets his kicks and dies. The harem of Bond girls in this movie are really beautiful and outstanding, so young, honey sweet and nubile you could have a stroke just looking at them in their skimpy outfits. Certain parts are too jokey and farcical as are all the Bond movies with Roger Moore. Too much humour and not enough gritty action. Only the old hero himself, Sean Connery had it just right. Sean has that certain je nais se quoi that all the rest lack; just the right touch of steely ruthlessness, a soupcon of humour and a dash of romance. Pierce Brosnan is good but overly serious and lacks the humour of Roger. The climactic big battle in outer space is somewhat incredible but what the hell, we go to movies to escape the boring reality of our mundane, humdrum lives, don't we?? ""Jaws"" is here with his steel teeth and as they say, you can't beat cold steel. He even falls in love with a short blonde Fraulein with 2 long plaited pigtails! This is one of my favourite movies. Recently, on August 14, I was the first gourmet in the world to pair mooncakes with wines in Singapore. In honour of this movie, I gave this project the codename ""Moonraker"" as I did not want others to hijack my idea. This is great movie to watch with friends and family at home with lots of mooncakes, honey popcorn, beer nuts, a big bag of English Devonshire toffees and Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin demi-sec champagne.

The bond producers weren't stupid were they.  1977 something from a galaxy far far away inspires a rewrite of a fleming book into a whole new story.  Which is just as well, because the best bits from the Moonraker novel were already used in other bond films.  This is also the Jaws 2 movie.
This is also the bond movie that showed bare breast in the festival scene, but then they cut it.  The bond producers were also smart enough to not mess with a formula that did not need cursing and nudity to overcome poor writing, poor imagination and poor directing.  I had this Moore movie ranked higher, but I just love some of the post Moore bond movies so it has been sliding down my rankings.",1055894400,,758,4.333333333333333
1399118,3,B000056OCJ,"If you noticed the end credits of The Spy Who Loved Me, you would take it that Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only.  In the same year TSWLM was released, 1977, a global phenomenon swept the world with an intense cult following that continues to prevail to this very day, Star Wars.  Two years later, the producers at Eon released Moonraker, a science-fiction adventure with a climactic Star Wars-style laser fight in outer space, obviously inspired by the resounding success of Star Wars.
In this 11th film of the Bond series, James Bond, played by the dashing Roger Moore, is assigned to locate a missing Moonraker shuttle, which was supposed to be delivered via a carrier jet to Britain from the Drax Corporation.  Instead, the shuttle is hijacked in midair and therefore, destroying the carrier as it had taken off.  Bond travels to California to the estate of Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), the extremely wealthy brainchild of the Moonraker and when he deduces that Drax is attempting to eliminate him, Bond is hot on Drax's trail.  Bond hops through Venice and Rio de Janiero, unraveling Drax's scheme to exterminate humankind with a contagious agent, harmful to humans, but otherwise a nonfactor for plants and animals.  In doing so, Drax plans to repopulate Earth in a matter of time, with his race of ""supreme"" beings, utilizing his space station as temporary refuge.  Teaming up with Bond to thwart Drax's terrifying scheme is Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), one of Drax's scientists and an astronaut-in-training.  Out to prevent Bond and his lady friend from saving the day is Drax's Asian right-hand man, Chou and a memorable face from The Spy Who Loved Me, the infamous Jaws (Richard Kiel).
Moonraker is a fun non-stop romp, comical, perhaps way too comical, ridiculous and unbelievable, but it was nothing more than a rush to capitalize on the prosperity of Star Wars.  Moore is seemingly goofy in this outing, but he compensates with a solid performance.  Lois Chiles' Holly Goodhead is a gorgeous beauty with brains, but she's probably way too technically involved to be the ideal Bond girl.  Drax is a rather flat, unemotional villain with various elaborate traps for Bond and nothing more.  Jaws is not as brilliant as he was in The Spy Who Loved Me, as his cheesy, rather silly side is revealed when he falls in love with a quirky, nerdy blonde.  Jaws even talks in this film!  The storyline is rather rushed than usual, as Bond becomes entrapped through non-stop, riveting action sequences in exotic locales.  All in all, Moonraker is a pulse-pounding sci-fi action adventure, with its awkward and frivolous moments, but extremely fun to watch, despite its lack of depth.",1054512000,,2695,4.905286343612334
1399119,4,B000056OCJ,"""Moonraker"" is perhaps the most lavishly bizarre and absurd of the James Bond adventures. Capitalizing on the then U.S. obsession with the space program, the film concocts a plot in which a diabolical industrialist, Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) hijacks his own space shuttle for an in-space rendezvous with a secret space station. In an age of intergalactic pipe dreams - this one must have seemed like an implausible lulu though Mir has since proven at least part of Drax's dream to possess a curious legitimacy. The now infamous and much anticipated pre-title sequence has Bond engaging his arch nemesis, the steel trapped Jaws (Richard Kiel) before stealing Jaw's parachute in mid-air. The silver toothed oaf tumbles from the sky onto a big top circus tent - shaken but not stirred, and opening up the bold brassy styling of Shirley Bassey's title song.
From here onward, the film finds Bond engaging the aid of a NASA specialist, the sultry and ironically intellectual (I say ironically because Bond girls of this vintage were usually nothing more than half naked wallpaper for our hero to bed and betray) Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles). Together Goodhead and Bond discover the truth about Drax - that he has been using the space program as his front to breed a genetically superior race of humans which he intends on propelling into outer space so that he can decimate the world population with a poisonous gas - thereby leaving planet earth a virgin country for his own superior hybrid to repopulate. Okay, who said anything about reality? As far fetched as fantasy goes - Moonraker delivers on every level. Roger Moore is Bond on this outing, delivering his usual quota of adroit one liners and dominating the landscape at all times as Britain's most amiable super spy.

As with ""The Spy Who Love Me"", ""Moonraker"" gets the deluxe visual presentation via MGM's restoration efforts from the mid-1990's for the laserdisc format. Colors on this DVD are rich, bold and sharply contrasted. Shadow delineation and black levels are superb. Edge enhancement, aliasing and pixelization are kept to a bare minimum. Chips and scratches are non-existent - almost. There is a vibrancy to the print elements that make the whole film appear much younger than it actually is. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 surround and is engaging, bright and very strong in its bass.

He meets a Heidi-esque girl and falls in love, and they too, end up in space.  In the end, he even assists Bond and Dr. Goodhead (a very forgettable Bond girl) in their escape of the doomed space station.

1399137,4,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker is something of the guilty pleasure of the James Bond epic.  Its setting in space is not really appropriate for the continuity - this despite the space context behind Dr. No, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds Are Forever - and there is an admitted excess of comedy relief in the film's scope.  But despite such weaknesses, the film contains many memorable scnees as well as one of the series' most enjoyably evil villians.
The Moonraker is a space shuttle, and one such is being flown to the UK - but it is hijacked in mid-air.  Sir Miles Meservy (Bernard Lee in what turned out to be his final go as M; he passed away after completion of the film) summons James Bond - who must escape a mid-air attempt on his life and steal a parachute from a fleeing pilot, and then escape the return of Richard Kiel's Jaws.
James gets one of my favorite of Q's defense devices - a wrist-mounted nerve-activated dart discharger - and then flies to California, where he is escorted to the vast territory of space industrialist Hugo Drax by his pilot Corinne (Corinne Clery).  The film very cleverly disguises Paris airport and an ancient palace in the French countryside as California, via strategically edited Derek Meddings miniatures of Drax Industries' construction, windtunnel, and testing structures and also in Drax's palatial estate - ""every stone brought from France,"" as Corinne explains.
James meets Hugo Drax (Michel Lonsdale, his name anglicanized in the credits for the benefit of US audiences), and in Mr. Drax we see the most understatedly confident - and sinister - of Bond's adversaries - ""Look after Mr. Bond, see that some harm comes to him,"" he says in tremendously effective understated monotone.  Drax turns James over to engineer Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) who doesn't take kindly to James' flirty behavior.  She escorts him to a centrifuge and asks him to try it - but Drax's Chinese manservant makes a key change in the control room that means James will be crushed by G-forces until his wrist gun blows out the cockpit's circuitry.  Here Roger Moore is exceptionally effective as he pantomines the sickening dizziness of escaping death in the centrifuge while Goodhead tries to help him to his feet.
Once James recovers, he and Corinne check papers in Drax's wallsafe, and after a quail shoot in which Drax invites James to participate (and which leaves a would-be assassin on his face), James is escorted to the airport - and in the series' most genuinely gruesome scene, Corinne is dispatched by Drax's hunting hounds in the claustrophobic pincer of the woods.
James finds a key clue in a vial of lethal liquid in a lab located over an antique museum - liquid that proves deadly to two scientists in another strikingly effective scene - and James then escapes assaault by Drax's manservant, but when he alerts M and Minster Frederick Grey (Geoffrey Keen), Drax pulls the ultimate switcheroo, leaving Freddie Grey mortified and M forced to relieve James of duty - officially, that is.
James and Holly Goodhead then decide to stop working against each other, and their relationship takes a positive turn when they escape an attempt by Drax's newest hired assassin - Jaws.  But the full nature of Drax's activities only becomes clear when James tracks down his lair in the deepest portion of the Amazonian jungle - highlighted by one of John Barry's loveliest music pieces as James follows beatiful women into an ancient Mayan temple that proves not to be ancient at all.
James finally finds Holly - note the conference chamber in which James and Holly reunite; if it looks like the conference chamber on the Death Star, it is - the exact same set, redressed.  The two then must work together and fly a Moonraker shuttle to Drax's ultimate base of operations, a setup straight out of Noah's Ark.  James and Holly then get unexpected help from an old enemy who has found an unexpected close new friend - at the film's end he and the well-endowed blonde lady toast with champagne; ""Well, here's to us.""
James and Holly, meanwhile, must literally sweat out the tremendous heat of the earth's ionosphere in an exciting space chase - and at the end, the weightlessness of space is the perfect venue for lovemaking, leading to the film's drop-dead best double entendre - ""My God, what's Bond doing?"" storms Freddie Grey; Q, not viewing the in-cockpit video cam but instead reading the tracking scanner, replies that James is attempting reentry.",1028332800,,4461,4.84251968503937

""Moonraker"" usually gets negative reviews from the critics and is ranked as one of the weaker Bond films. This is probably due to the last 20-25 minutes of the movie. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it's something you would expect to see in Star Wars rather than James Bond. Star Wars and Star Trek: The Motion Picture had been released around this time, and their success may have inspired the Bond producers to imitate much of the outer space action. That was probably a mistake. Overall though, I found ""Moonraker"" to be a fun movie to watch. The DVD picture quality is very good, and like all James Bond DVD's, it has an excellent documentary on how the movie was made. The audio commentary is also informative.",1026000000,,868,4.6797385620915035
1399139,4,B000056OCJ,"It is fashionable amongst Bond fans to slag Moonraker, however I would have to digress for these two reasons:
1) TIMING - The Fleming novel was hopeless outdated (Ooh-ahh, let's fire a big ol' missle at London!). The movie series was starting to run out of Fleming titles to use, and with the popularity of Star Wars in 1977, the timing could not have been better to get the ""Moonraker"" name on to film somehow. The title of ""Moonraker"" was the last unfilmed Fleming full novel, as the names of those films that followed (For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View To A Kill, and The Living Daylights) are taken from collections of short stories. Sooner or later, the film would have had to have been made; Brocolli could not have chosen a better time to do so! Most of the popularity and success of the film was because it was able to successfully latch on to the spacey sci-fi trends of the late 1970s. If Moonraker had be left until the mid-1980s to do something with, the output could have been much worse or had less impact. Space shuttles - which had futuristic mystic in 1978 - would become common place by the mid-1980s.
2) VISUAL QUALITY - Even after over 20-odd years, Moonraker still looks good in the special effects department. Other big production late-1970s movies, such as Logan's Run, Superman, or Battlestar Galactica can't say half as much.
That being said, the movie would have been ever better if the humour elements (usually at the expense of Jaws) was editted out - although bringing Jaws back was a good move. The Bonds have always been best when there were re-occuring villains to give some continuity (prime example is Blofeld appearing in five of the films, or a passing reference to Dr. No in From Russia With Love) such as during the Sean Connery run.
Yes, it could have been a better - but it also could have been much, much worse.",1025136000,,1856,4.559880239520958
1399140,3,B000056OCJ,"After the success of The Spy Who Loved Me, the producers of the long-running Bond series decided to use one of Ian Flemming's weaker novels to cash in on the Star Wars craze.
Moonraker starts off well, with a classic pre-credits teaser where Bond fights Jaws, the steel-toothed villain from TSWLM in a mid-air fight from an airplane. But both the action and plot get too far-fetched by the ending, and the whole thing feels like it's some big-budget Star Wars rip off, which is entirely reasonable. That said, it doesn't try to take itself too seriously, with the humour creating a more comical feel.
Humour aside, it fails as a Bond film, for becoming too far-fetched, and Roger Moore, while comfortable in the role, adds a layer of unnecessary goofiness throughout the film, making it an enjoyable, if not quite sensible entry into the franchise.",1018742400,,848,4.815068493150685

1399143,1,B000056OCJ,"It's clear that a movie is in trouble when it relies on references to other, hit, motion pictures to fill itself out.
MOONRAKER is in trouble from the outset. It tries desperately to capitalize on the mid-70s wave of ""Star Wars""-mania. This is ""James Bond Meets 'Star Wars'"" with none of the charm of the George Lucas offering, just an overreliance on special effects, a thin storyline, (nothing to do with the book at all), and a rehashing of old material.
Richard Kiel returns as ""Jaws,"" that buffoonish henchman, who in himself harks a reference to the Steven Spielberg hit. They even find him a girlfriend. Dumb. Plus, he's no Oddjob.
James Bond shouldn't try to be Luke Skywalker, either. Roger Moore continues to mistake MI-6 for Monty Python's Flying Circus, and mistake parody for humor, trading off the deadliness of the character for bad stand-up comedy. He obviously considers the the Bond films to be an exercise in camp humor, not action adventure with laughs.
Moore delivers pun after pun after pun, but lacks real wittiness. Moore doesn't even summon the self-awareness to be embarrassed at this turkey, by far the worst of the series. This one's a franchise-killer. Luckily, the gross receipts didn't blind them to the gross quality of this waste of time. Ugh.",1013990400,,1276,4.88479262672811

1399158,5,B000056OCJ,"""MOONRAKER"" is MY favorite of all the James Bond films. I have seen every Bond film at least 20 times each. I cannot speak for other fans, because we all have different perspectives, likes/dislikes, and opinions on what makes up the ""best"" James Bond film. I can only state MY opinion.
First of all, ""MOONRAKER"" is, to me, at least, the most ENJOYABLE of all the James Bond films. It is the sleekest and most-polished of them all; this may explain why some Bond fans consider it not ""gritty"" enough, and therefore, not among the best. I think the themesong ""Moonraker,"" ALSO MY FAVORITE, exquisitely gentle and flowing, delicate as moonlight itself, sung by Shirley Bassey, sets the tone for the entire movie. Interesting how the end credits picked up the pace with an uptempo disco remix of the title song. But then again, released to theatres in June of 1979, it WAS to be the Summer of Disco.
The scenery in southern California; a mini-France at Drax's estate; Venice, Italy; Rio de Janeiro and Iguassu Falls, Brazil; and of course the twinkling night sky of outer space DEFINITELY make ""MOONRAKER"" the most BEAUTIFUL and VISUALLY STUNNING of all the Bond films. I can WATCH the movie over and over and over, if ONLY for the scenery. The Sugar Loaf Mountain surveillance/cable car sequence in Rio de Janeiro is my favorite of ANY Bond film. It is definitely the most scenic and enthralling.
...and what about LOIS CHILES, certainly the most chic and classsy of all the female Bond cohorts. Looking like a brunette Shelley Hack, Miss Chiles is probably THE most capable and intelligent of ALL the Bond ""girls,"" which may threaten some male fantasies of what the ""Bond girl"" is supposed to be...the ineffectual, weak, helpless damsel in distress...not Holly Goodhead...as American CIA operative and fully-trained astronaut on loan from NASA, she SAVES Bond from disaster as often, if not more, than he saves her...Remember: SHE drove the rocket and the Moonraker space shuttle...together they were the strongest TEAM effort of Bond and female counterpart...Interesting note: JACLYN SMITH, of American television program CHARLIE'S ANGELS, was first choice for the role of Holly Goodhead, but declined the role due to the suggestive name of the character and scheduling conflicts. I wonder how the film might have been had she taken the role. Regretably the small role of Manuela, Bond's sidekick from Station VH, in Rio de Janeiro, gets virtually no screen time at all.
Of course the gadgetry is great...I mean, really, a runaway centrifuge...please. A mine-shooting speedboat with detachable hang-glider. Poison pens for relaxing anacondas...Nerve-impulse darts...a watch that blows explosives...an ENTIRE CITY in space, invisible to radar (what...it never cast a shadow over a continent at NOON? COME ON!)
The only real problem I have with this film is the depiction of Hugo Drax. A man who, obsessed with the sterilization of the world and starting it over, not unlike a certain world leader we once had, is subtley portrayed as a homosexual. He directly propositions James Bond at tea time on his California estate, while offering him a sandwich (listen for the line), and none of Drax's ladies are involved with Drax directly...only with the Noah's Ark mission into space. Drax's companion in his own Moonraker shuttle is a young male. While currently we may be able to laugh it off as idiotic, sadly enough, such a portrayal was within the realms of political correctness in 1979.
Anyway, enjoy this film for what it is, no more, no less. Even if you don't think it was the best Bond film ever, it was certainly the best film and box-office smash of 1979, and one of the best action/adventure/space-themed films of the 1970's.

1399159,2,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker starts off very good. Moore again easily slips into Bond's shoes... Q has crazier gadgets than ever... there's a good strong plot... but around the last 45 minutes or so, it begins to try to destroy itself in every way possible.
It begins to try and turn itself into an Airplane!-like spoof and almost completely jeopardizes all the Bond films that came before it. It waters down all the action and love sequences with goofball slapstick and has a happily-ever-after ending that would make even Walt Disney cringe: Jaws decides he should become a good guy in the name of his girlfriend.
Also, in these last 45 minutes, there are many ripoffs to other better films. Like, for example, Mr. Trolly Does Time, a terrific film, is where Moonraker gets much of its milage (The whole scelevator scene was done earlier and better in MTDT). Also Moonraker borrows heavily from Ardy in the Hood, that excellent blaxploitation film starring a talking aardvark, in all of its chases.
The film's plot: a US space shuttle named Moonraker vanishes while transported by RAF. 007 is sent to question the builder of the shuttle, Hugo Drax. Bond suspects Drax more and more as he teams up with CIA agent Holly. Then he discovers a hokey conspiracy involving poison gas.

1399160,1,B000056OCJ,"Watching this movie is a very sad experience. Why?
1) The Fleming novel was one of the best. The one similarity this movie has with the novel is the character's names, and the title. The filmmakers ignored a good story just to cash in on 'Star Wars'.
2) Bond is no longer Fleming's character. How can riding around St, Mark's Square in Venice, in an amphibious gondola be considered 'secret agent'? The double-taking pigeon alone makes this entire film terrible.
3) In the mid-60's, the Bond movies inspired a host of copies - Matt Helm, and Flint being the most famous. Now, it's Bond who is being the copy-cat, doing a bad Star Wars copy, with bad effects. (Explosions in zero-gravity space where the smoke and debris falls down; and visible strings that hold up Bond and Goodhead at the end to name 2.)
4) Idiotic one-liners that are totally unfunny to anyone over the age of 12.
This movie removes Bond from the 'spy thriller' category of movies, and puts Bond into 'camp comedy', such as the later Pink Panther movies. By making this the way the fimmakers did, they destroyed the concept of 'Bond', and what made the series famous in the first place. Compare 'From Russia With Love' with this one.

1399174,4,B000056OCJ,"Now, a lot of Bond fans will tell you that The Spy Who Loved Me was Moore's best. I do somewhat agree with them on that. I think TSWLM was one of the best Bonds in the series. However, I think this is Moore's best, by far, though The Spy Who Loved Me is a close second for me. Because, by the time Moonraker was made, Moore had been in four Bond films, and he had made a more believeable Bond (sort of like now, with Brosnan, who's also getting better with each Bond). Sure, Moonraker was cheesy at times (like the fight between Bond and the Samurai in the Italian glass museum, and the gondola chase through downtown Venice), and some of the one-liners were expected, but overall, it was one of the better 007 outings, especially after some of the worst ones, like The Man With The Golden Gun.
This one involves Bond's rendevous with Hugo Drax, the man in charge of building space shuttles for NASA. When one of them is hijacked, Bond is called in to investigate. I know what you're thinking, ""What the hell is a British spy doing being called in to investigate a stolen American shuttle?"" The answer is, I don't know, either. Anyway, what he's found is that Drax is actually in charge of building a secret space staion and plans on wiping out the human race with a deadly toxin, so he can start over with his plans for a ""master race"". Sounds a little far-fetched, doesn't it? Actually, this is one of the more original villains in 007 history. This time Bond travels to Rio, Venice, Los Angeles, and even outer space to bring down Drax and his little operation.
My only complaint with this DVD is, despite a nice transfer, both video and sound, there's very little extras. MGM didn't do as much with this one as they have with the previous Bond discs. There's only one commentary, there's two documentaries, one on Moonraker, and one on Bond's special effects. Both aren't really interesting, and I don't think they'll hold your attention too long. There's also the trailer and a gallery of pictures. Again, not much there, either. Other than that, I think this is one of the best Bond outings, and this should be in your collection, whether you enjoy Bond, or great action films.",987206400,,2183,4.501259445843829
1399175,5,B000056OCJ,"A lot of people ridicule this movie, but it is one of the best Bond movies.  Why?  Because it has what you want in an action/adventure movie: a good, solid story from start to end, a little bit of a mystery, some good detective work, suspense and fantastic action scenes.
There are some downsides to the movie that prevent it from being the best Bond ever.  It is cartoonish in parts, Moore is too nonchalant, and the female lead is very flat (in acting).
This movie has some of the best action scenes ever made.  The opening sequence of Bond being kicked out of an airplane and fighting for a parachute is simply spectacular.  Moonraker came out at the same time as Superman-the Movie.  The hype in Superman was ""You will believe a man can fly"".  The Superman flight scenes don't come anywhere close to Moonraker.
The fight scenes are perfectly choreographed and have a wonderful flow to them.  Compare this to the choppy fight scenes in other Bond movies.  In the underwater scene in For Your Eyes Only, Bond is trapped by the man in the diving suite.  But after a bad edit, Bond just slips away with no understanding on how he did it.
The climatic outspace battle is great.  Sure it is sci-fi, but the scene is better than what you find in most sci-fi movies.
This movie has a tight story from start to finish.  A space shuttle is stolen, and everything in the movie builds up to  resolving this issue.  In some Bond movies, (such as Diamonds Are Forever or Man With A Golden Gun) you have no idea of what the story is about until near the end of the movie.
The storyline of Moonraker has a very good progression as Bond moves from one clue to the next.  This keeps the tension and suspense at a high level throughout the film.  Some of the other Bond movies are more episodic (even some of the best like From Russia With Love) rather than being a complete story.  Most important, the story never lags.",985132800,,1905,4.412607449856734
1399176,5,B000056OCJ,"Roger Moore's version of Bond is a classic. There isn't a shortage of double entendres and cheap pick-up lines in a Moore 007 film. You can't resist a chuckle whenever Bond makes sexually-loaded comments to all the women he meets - and they barely bat an eyelid. If Connery or Brosnan (whose portryals of Bond are decidedly more earnest) were to try it, it wouldn't be as effective. But Moore's comical and laconic bond works a treat. He's fun to watch.
'Moonraker' is the name of Drax Industries' space shuttle. When one is hi-jacked in mid-air whilst being piggybacked by a 747, Bond is sent by MI6 to investigate. This leads him directly to weirdo billionaire industrialist Hugo Drax, who we discover is hell bent on eradicating all life on Earth and re-populating it with his perfect race of humans. Moonraker was one of the first Bond movies I saw so it really is a sentimental favourite. Watching it again on DVD was reliving all those great moments, like seeing Drax's henchman falling through a piano, whereupon Bond quips, 'Play It again, Sam'.
Moonraker is out of this world. It's the only movie in the franchise that doesn't fit with the others. There's a finale aboard a space station with the astronauts fighting with laser guns, for crying out loud! You're in for a disappointment if you expect this to be like the newer Bond films.

The villain, who seemed so original and cool in Spy Who Loved Me, is merely a distraction here, he is only in a few scenes and none are memorable. Plenty of gadgets and special effects, though, which keep this from having no redeemable value. There was little here to keep me watching, except I noticed the door tone on the apartment is the same as in Close Encounters.

1399178,4,B000056OCJ,"This is one of the most intriguing series-based films ever released. Gone is James Bond's (Roger Moore) hard character with a dangerous approach to everything, who gradually faded away in the five films pre-dating this one, and is replaced by a wise-cracking spy, more reminiscent of James Coburn's Flint than James Bond, who seems to know his escape routes before the time even comes for him to plan them!
However, a classically evil villain is played by Sir Hugo Drax, a multi-billionaire who is concerned with various strange events regarding his newly developed Moonraker space shuttle, though the movie is a far cry from the Anti-Nazi original novel by Ian Fleming, based around the Moonraker Nuclear Missile. Whilst the movie is generally aimed at the humour-nerves of the audience, there are some almost frighteningly serious moments (for example, when Drax's assistant - Corrine Dufour - is savaged by guard dogs, and when a scientist in one of Drax's nerve gas labs accidently breaks open a vile of gas, demonstrating to Bond the power of the stuff).
The movie is full of excellent witticism, which makes a change from the general stupid-humour of Live And Let Die, an excellent example being when Bond puts a powerful dart into an enemy's heart - ""You look desolated Mr. Bond."" BANG! ""Heartbroken, Mr. Drax."" Classic.
Perhaps a little long, and the middle of the movie could be shot better (messing around in Rio de Janeiro gets tiresome even after the second time of watching), and Jaws (Richard Kiel) is not quite as good as in The Spy Who Loved Me, on account of the silly love affair he has halfway through this movie. Jaws is the baddy Bond couldn't beat, so why do the two join up at the end? I felt a little lost that Bond should simply escape because of Jaws's change in feelings - surely the metal-toothed one should make for an excellent fight scene and death in space? (that's exactly what I expected when I knew the movie had Jaws in and was set in space).
Fairly good plot, and the LASER-based space battle at the end is very intense, and the opening scene is on par with the Man With the Golden Gun and The Living Daylights - a free fall jump from a plane and a space shuttle is hi-jacked off the back of a jumbo jet mid-flight! This is Bondian action at its best, though the movie lacks some of the more subtle touches of the ""real"" Bond classics - these touches are indescribable, and thus only an examlple will suffice: ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No mister Bond, I expect you to die."" all the while Bond is nearly emasculated on a gold topped table by an industrial LASER. etc. (from Goldfinger).
An important addition to the Bond series, as it takes him to the final frontier, and also probably the lightest, but try not to cover your eyes up with a cushion when Corrine Dufour is hunted down. It's not that chilling. Honest.",984441600,,2855,4.611001964636542

Lois Chiles, while in my opinion is the least of the Bond girls, still fits the bill, and Roger Moore is my favorite Bond actor, and he takes his role in this film confidently.

1399199,5,B000056OCJ,"Science Fiction, science fact, action-adventure, romance, sex, wonderous special effects, beautiful women, a solid plot, superb acting, excellent sets and costumes, what more could you want in a James Bond film?
Moonraker, by far, is my favorite James Bond movie(and the only one that I own). In an attempt to capitalize on the Star Wars craze two years before, Moonraker takes the dashing British secret agent from Southern California, to Venice, Italy, to Rio de Jenaro(?), to a magnificent space station in Earth orbit! The plot involves Bond trying to locate a missing space shuttle that was hijacked in mid-air. Bond begins his mission by investigating Hugo Drax, a wealthy industrialist, who wishes to capitalize on the growing space race. Along the way, he joins forces with a lovely astronaut/CIA Agent named Holly Goodhead (played wonderfully by the ever-beautiful Lois Chilles), who is also investigating the hi-jack, and some secret activities made by Drax. During the course of the movie, both James and Holly discover that Drax plans on annihilating the entire world population with a nerve gas from a space station in orbit. Drax's goal, to repopulate the Earth with humans of absolute physical perfection. It is up to Bond, holly, and Bond's old nemesis Jaws to stop Drax from carrying out his terrifying plan.
Despite what some die-hard fans of the Bond movies might say, I really enjoyed this film. It definately had everything going for it. And the results bear out well. We also have a Bond girl who is not only just beautiful, but has intelligence as well. Lois Chilles is without a doubt, the best Bond girl in a movie. One who can kick major ""you-know-what"" and take names. The scenes between her and Roger Moore(including the passionate love scenes between them)are beautifully made and acted out. Michael Lonsdale was equally effective as the villian Drax. Truly an arch-nemesis for Bond, and someone who is very despicable. Not your average mustache-twirling villain. Drax really means business in this movie.
Overall, the best James Bond movie ever made. If you love action and excitement, as well as solid science fiction, this is the film to watch. It goes to show you that the British are indeed  excellent filmmakers. Yet, one wishes that ITC Entertainment distributed the film instead of United Artists. Oh, well. You can't have everything.",971049600,,2371,5.063938618925831
1399200,2,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker is easily the least of the series. Period. Dumb, child friendly slapstick does not belong in a Bond film.  I don't believe a Bond film needs to be realistic or even plausible, but it should take itself at least a LITTLE seriously.  Now, I have no problem with Roger Moore, I grew up with him in the role, nor do I have a problem with humor or comedy, but I do have a problem with stupidity.  That said, the real reason I write this is to give you the lowdown on the special features.  The 45 minute documentary on the making of the film is quite good, with interesting footage and anecdotes, the trailer seems to be the original British version and has some Star Wars inspired logos, and the commentary is also quite engaging, filled with fascinating tidbits supplied by director Gilbert and producer Wilson.  As always, the special features are worth the price alone. So, in the end, a dumb movie with great extras, if you're a Bond completist as I am you'll want this, but otherwise, look elsewhere in the series.  My advice is to watch with the commentary on, to spare yourself the full brunt of the idiocy on screen.",970963200,,1130,4.487804878048781
1399201,4,B000056OCJ,"Roger Moore's fourth outing as superagent James Bond ranks among the goofiest in the 007 film series.  In fact, ""Moonraker"" is like a 007 parody--and the story is so similar to the film which precedes it that it should have been called ""The Spy Who Loved Me 2"".  Every single little thing in this flick is over the top: the high-speed amphibious gondola, the gratuitous use of sexy bimbos, the mid-air hijacking of a space shuttle in the movie's opening scene--and let's not forget the return of the unstoppable,  metallic-mouthed Jaws (the legendary bad guy role that made Richard Kiel famous).
Obviously, ""Moonraker"" is too silly for it's own good, but it's great fun to watch.  Lonsdale's evil Drax delivers some of the funniest lines in the whole movie without even a hint of a smile.  The scene where Moore is pushed out of a plane without a parachute ranks among the best action sequences in the whole series.  The sets and models are fantastic, too.  It's pure escapism; watched on those terms alone, Moonraker is a hoot.",969926400,,1028,4.741573033707865
1399202,5,B000056OCJ,"When I first saw this film I remember that it really broke my heart. I grew up in the 60s on James Bond and Sean Connery amongst others. The first 45 minutes of ""Moonraker"" was the closest that the Roger Moore Bonds had ever come to the look and feel of the James Bond films of the 60s. It was really incredible. Equally incredible was how the film did a flip-flop into slapstick when Bond is floating down that canal in Venice. As the film progressed the level of slapstick escalated. It was just plain out ridicules. The film was very annoying.
I thought Roger Moore had finally combined his best qualities as a personality and an actor to represent James Bond in this film. His scene in the centrifuge showed his ability to bring depth to the character in a very credible way. This one scene is a standout because it equals any performance given by any of the actors that have portrayed James Bond in this series. Christopher Wood, given sole screenplay credit this time, delivered a script full of witty dialogue. The free-fall pre-credit sequence with John Barry's background score, incredible stunt work and cinematography was excellent. With so many fine elements at their peak of perfection it was a shame that the film unraveled in so many different directions.
When I saw this film on opening day I remembered how the whole lobby was crammed with people. As I sat during the film I remember a little boy who was sitting in front of me turn around and look at his father. ""Daddy I really like this movie."" I never forgot that. It took me about 10 years to understand what this film was really all about. The Bond films have been around for almost 40 years now. I suppose with each decade another generation of Bond fans is born. Each generation takes with them the fond memories of their introduction to James Bond. Each generation savors the moment and no matter what I or anyone else says is going to erase those memories. The magic of ""Moonraker"" is that it contains the best to the worst, or the worst to the best, of all the elements found in the series. There is something in ""Moonraker"" for everyone.",969667200,,2116,4.541884816753926
1399213,3,B000056OCJ,"This is my first 007 adventure, and I hope it won't be my last. Aside from  a few plot flaws and the stupid view of women the film employs, this movie  was relatively good. I've heard many Bond fans say that this is among the  worst in the series, so I won't be too critical until I've seen more. The  plot itself is extremely far fetched, and, the film being made in a time  when NASA hadn't even sent up a shuttle, the depiction of the ""space  station"" and all the Moonraker spacecraft's is rather amusing.
The  basic idea of this movie is that an evil villain, Sir Hugo Drax, is  planning to destroy the human race and set up a physically  ""perfect"" race in its place. He plans to carry out his sinister  plan from a space station in orbit of earth. Naturally, agent 007 is  assigned to the case after one of the Moonraker shuttle crafts mysterious  disappears while being transported on the back of a 747. Armed with a cool  new gadget that saves his life more than once, provided by the charming  character of Q, Bond flies to American, then to Europe, then Central  America, and finally to space itself. For those of you who liked the film  preceding this one, ""The Spy who Loved Me"" you'll be glad to know  that Jaws returns in this film. He's a good character and villain, aside  from the love story they put in (very ridiculous.) The film's plot and  action were fairly sound, though, especially the latter.
One of the  aspects that really bothered me was the portrayal women. Bond sees them  merely as objects, which is, no questions asked, very wrong. Throughout the  course of the movie he sleeps, or makes advances, on four different women.  Thankfully, the innuendo wasn't too bad in this one, nor was the language.  The thing that really kills this movie, and Bond movies in general, is the  portrayal of women. I'm not saying I don't believe there shouldn't be  pretty women in these films, merely that their sexuality shouldn't be  played up as much. Aside from that, most everything else is splendid. The  action is great, although it didn't come as often as I would have  preferred. Two boat chases, a hilarious fight scene in which Bond and a  Japanese guy who's trying to kill him destroy millions of dollars of  precious art pieces in a museum. Other scenes include Bond sky diving from  an air plane without a parachute, a sequence with a nasty looking snack, a  lazer gun battle (very cheesy, but none the less good), and several other  excellent scenes.
The DVD itself is wonderful, but that's pretty much to  be expected with a special edition copy such as this. The interactive menu  is pretty cool, as are the documentaries, trailer, and photo album. The  transition to DVD is marvelous, and you can hardly tell the film was made  in the late 70s. However, although it might be worth it to some Bond  fanatics, I believe $35.00 is a little steep for this edition, even with  all of the extras.
All in all, and with Amazon.com's discount, I would  highly recommend this film. Despite some of its setbacks, I can plainly  see, if indeed this is the worst, how the 007 films have become so popular  over the past half-century. I just ordered ""Goldfinger"", which is  supposedly one of the best, so I hope I can give a better review of that  one soon. Enjoy!",968630400,,3281,4.514480408858603
1399214,3,B000056OCJ,"""Moonraker"", released in 1979, is the eleventh entry of the James Bond series and the fourth time actor Roger Moore plays the suave secret  agent. Coming off the incredible success of ""The Spy Who Loved  Me"" but also mindful of the success of big budget blockbuster such as  ""Star Wars"", ""Moonraker"" was given the largest budget  yet for a Bond film, over twice that of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".  Most of that budget should go to special effects because like Luke  Skywalker, James Bond would also enter the realm of outer space. Although  ""Moonraker"" gross more money than any Bond film before, the film  is proof that more money or better special effects does not guarantee a  better movie.
Bond's latest adventure begins with a trip to California  to investigate the apparent hijacking of a NASA space shuttle that was on  loan to the British. Bond is traveling to meet Hugo Drax the man whose  corporations build the space shuttles and trains many of NASA's astronauts.  Drax appears to be hiding something so when Bond does some midnight  snooping around Drax's country estate, Drax decides to he must arrange  ""an amusing death"" for Mr. Bond. During Bond's tour of Drax's  astronaut training complex, he meets Dr Holly Goodhead, an astronaut on  loan from NASA. After barely surviving a suspicious training accident, Bond  finally discovers some blueprints that point him to a glass works in  Venice, Italy. Bond is surprised to bump into Dr. Goodhead in Venice, only  later to discover she is actually a CIA agent who is also investigating  Drax. Another nighttime survey, he Bond discovers a secret lab producing a  deadly nerve toxin. The trail now leads to Rio de Janeiro, where now Bond's  old nemesis Jaws attempts stop him, and finally into Amazon jungle where  Bond discovers a secret shuttle base. Bond has blundered into the one of  most sinister plots ever conceived, the destruction of all mankind through  a deadly assault from space. Can Bond with the help of Dr. Goodhead stop  Drax before he achieves his dream?
When one watches  ""Moonraker"", one might feel that somehow the storyline seems  vaguely familiar and one would be right. ""Moonraker"", in a very  subtle way, recycles the basic plot elements from ""The Spy Who Loved  Me"". Once one notices what is going on, it is quite easy spot the  similarities. The British lose a space shuttle (""The Spy Who Loved  Me"", a nuclear submarine), the man responsible is a rich industrialist  (shipping magnate) who nurses a dream to reshape the world after destroying  all humanity from space (triggering WW III). Drax finds that one of his  female staff has betrayed him and he has his dogs (his shark) kill her.  Drax has built a city in space (a city under the water); Bond gets involved  with a beautiful CIA agent (a beautiful KGB agent), and so on. Although  this in no way should be a real black mark against ""Moonraker"",  however, it is obvious that the production team was trying to play it safe  by basing the screenplay with a proven formula.
The problem is that in  trying to duplicate the previous film, the makers failed to reproduce the  chemistry that made ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" so entertaining.  Although Roger Moore continued to play Bond well, Lois Chiles, who played  Holly Goodhead and was originally considered for the role of Anya, turns in  a lackluster performance and romantic element between the two never really  sizzled. Michael Lonsdale's portrayal of Drax is good, but the character is  bit colorless. Even Richard Kiel's Jaws is damaged a bit by trying to  insert a love interest into the script. Fortunately, one of the bright  spots was Drax's first henchman Chang, played by Toshiro Sugo, who fought  Bond in one of the best fight scenes in the entire series. Bernard Lee,  Lois Maxwell, and Desmond Llewelyn continued their good performances in  their roles of ""M"", Miss Moneypenny, and ""Q"". On a sad  note, this would be the last time Bernard Lee would star in a Bond film,  having died just before the next Bond production.
Worst of all, the  special effects that consumed a lion's share of the budget, served to hurt  ""Moonraker"" as much as help. The space battle is a top-notch affair, worthy  of comparison with similar battles in ""Thunderball"" and ""You Only Live  Twice"" and the shuttle chasing Drax's spheres of death is quite excellent.  However, the emphasis on showing off the special effects in scenes such as  the numerous shuttle launches and the rendezvous with the space station  served only to slow down the action without turning up the suspense. The  production team too often uses special effects for its own sake (although  not anywhere as often as ""Star Trek, The Motion Picture"", released later  that year). As is the case with many movies made after ""Star Wars"", a  little less effort on special effects and a little more on live action  story would have done ""Moonraker"" good.
Of the different releases on  video, the 1998 MGM DVD has the best print of  ""Moonraker"" this reviewer  has seen although MGM will probably release a special edition sometime in  the future. ""Moonraker"" is a film that can be endlessly debated over. This  reviewer tends to like a good story and chemistry to along with his action  and ""Moonraker"" tends to falls short in the former categories. However, for  those who grew up loving action over content, this film may well be your  cup of tea. In any case, this reviewer rates ""Moonraker"" right in the  middle of Roger Moore's efforts behind those of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"",  ""For Your Eyes Only"", and ""Octopussy"".",965088000,,5564,4.795142555438226
1399215,4,B000056OCJ,"I first saw Moonraker when I was in Junior High on television. At the  time, I knew almost next to nothing about James Bond. The only thing about  James Bond I saw up to that time was a scene in Thunderball where Sean  Connery was being stalked by the tenacious Luciana Paluzzi and her  hoodlums.
I knew nothing about the history of Bond, and which film came  first or second, or third.... I knew nothing about the golden girl in  Goldfinger, nothing about the sexual names of Bond's various mates...I  didn't even know about the term ""Bond girl"". I know nothing about  the gadgets, or M, Q, or Moneypenny.
Moonraker, which everybody seems to  trashed, turned me on to the world of James Bond. I became a fan, and went  on to see every movie that came before it (For You Eyes Only just came out  in the theaters at the time)whenever it came on television.
If Moonraker  is so BAD....as all the naysayers claimed, I would have not been a  fan...and would never surrender myself to the world of 007. BUt instead, I  loved this movie, and I became a 007 fan that day. And judging by the box  office, Moonraker probably attracted thousands of new fans as  well.
Moonraker has all the element of a classic Bond film: from the  stunning midair pre-title sequence, to the ever reliable Shirley Bassey's  Moonraker theme song, to the lunar titles by Maurice Binder, to the  fantastic (okay, so it is a bit far fetch) plot to destroy mankind hatched  by a megalomaniac villain, to the humour (Jaws flapping his arms to fly,  and Goodhead saying: ""Take me around the world one more time"",  the special effects, the beautiful women in the form of Lois Chiles,  Corinne Clery, Emily Bolton and Leila Shenna (as well as Drax's bevy of  evil lovelies), to John Barry's score, and to Richard Kiel's Jaws, and of  course, the action.
Of course, if you have seen all the Bond films in  chronologic order, Moonraker may seem silly, contrived, lacking in  originality. But hey, not all of us were around in 1962!
One of the  biggest gripe, it seems, is that Bond went into outer space. Hey, Bond had  survived thousands of bullets shot at him, bedded dozens of women and have  not sire one illegitimate child, now all of a sudden we are talking about  reality?
Overall, Moonraker is an entertaining movie...and that is why I  was so glad that the DVD came out. Now I can watch Moonraker the way it was  supposed to be seen...on widescreen. And watching it on widescreen is like  watching an entirely different movie. You never realize how much you lose  with that hated pan and scan format.
Like all the Bond DvDs, it included  the trailers for Moonraker...however, the trailer of Moonraker which is  based on the scene where Corinne Dufour was being chased by Drax's dobermen  was ommitted.
The background piece on Moonraker is very informative. Too  bad they didn't interview Corinne Clery, who was one of the highlights in  the film.",964915200,,2917,4.610136452241715

1399221,2,B000056OCJ,"This is in all aspects the worst 007 movie ever.  It was right when Roger  Moore was getting used to his role as Bond, when the series was at its  hottest financially, and when the franchise was booming with popularity.  At the end of '77s the Spy Who Loved Me, it had said, ""JAMES BOND WILL  RETURN IN FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.""  Only after the success of Star Wars,  as the DVD's documentary will tell you, did they decide to go with Ian  Fleming's 1950-something novel based on that success.  Right on to Cubby  because he was right, the Bond series hit the peak with this absolute dud,  ""raking"" (haha) in the most money ever.  The problem is that the  wit of Fleming was taken out from its book and used for pure sensationalism  because of what was popular at the moment.
I am a James Bond enthusiast.  I own all of the 007 films and am re-buying some on the new DVD editions.  It actually offends me to see people complimenting this film because this  movie goes against every thing that is about the series.  Anyone who has  carefully watched the films over and over again like myself who has  realized there are certain things that must be and absolutely cannot be in  a James Bond movie must conclude that this film breaks all of the  rules...for all of the worst reasons.  I'm glad that the series bounced  back in '81 with For Your Eyes Only, otherwise who knows where the series  would be today.
The reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is  because the film has two really good things about it, all in the first  fifteen minutes:  the parachute chase before the credits and the theme  song.  After then turn the film off because you aren't missing anything and  then watch the extras because no matter how dumb the movie is the extras  are always interesting, despite the fact that this film is the least  features-laden disc of the 5-DVD set.",961632000,,1862,4.414201183431953
1399222,3,B000056OCJ,"It is very easy to dismiss ""Moonraker"" as being nothing more than a hocus-pocus attempt to blend James Bond with science-fiction.  And to a large extent, it is.  Yet for some reason, I still like it.  Granted,  its plot and premise are by far the most outrageously ludicrous of the  entire series.  But at least it's done well.  Quite well, for that matter.  Unlike ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" and ""Live And Let  Die,"" ""Moonraker"" actually looks like a Bond film, and in  fact is one of the most lavishly produced of all 007 epics, scoring highly  on all aspects of glamour.  Its locations are among the most breathtaking  and beautiful in the franchise's history, ranging from the canals of  Venice, to the vistas of Rio, including the spectacular Iguasu falls on the  Argentinian border.  The film's one truly phenomenal moment is its mid-air  parachute fight during the opening.  Few stunts in the series have equalled  it.  And as you learn in the DVD documentary, it was done for real!  Of  course, once the science-fiction really kicks in, you can't help but wish  you were back on earth.  A bad Bond girl (Lois Chilles) also hurts the  film, and Jaws's encore appearance isn't as effective as in ""The Spy  Who Loved Me.""

1399235,1,B000056OCJ,"Lewis Gilbert's Moonraker is a depressing high budget Sci/Fi action film that contradcits all that James Bond is inherantly supposed to represent. By trying to manipulate Bond into other cultural fads, they've cheapened  the sophistication and style that made Bond the name that it is today. With  the gargantuan success of George Lucas's Sci/Fi epic Star Wars, Albert  ""Cubby"" Brocoli decided what better way to capitalize on this  widening public awareness of science fiction than to put James Bond into  space. This task would become easier said than done. The story takes James  Bond (Roger Moore) on a mission to recover a missing space shuttle  nicknamed Moonraker. On the way he meets gorgeous Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois  Chiles) and wealthy Avionic mongul Hugo Drax (Micheal Lonsdale).  Budgeted  at an extremely high (1979 standards) budget of 32 million dollars and shot  on three large French film studios in Paris, France, Moonraker had  exceptionally high production values that allowed Moonraker to become a  visually impressive epic of death-defying stunts, impressive world-wide  locales, drop-dead beauties, and oscar nominated special effects. Sadily  dsepite all its impressive trappings, Moonraker lacks any emotional heart  to make this journey worth taking. The addition of the vastly popular Jaws  (Richard Kiel) becomes nothing more than mere comic relief this time  around. Roger Moore hams up his one-liners, and the addition of fine Ken  Adams sets does nothing more than furnish a stellar looking shell of film.  Moonraker remains an example of lost oppurtunities within a project that  foresakes its strengths for a new product. I'd rather watch home movies  than watch the looney tune antics displayed in Moonraker. As for the DVD  features, all are top-notch but why bother.",960768000,,1803,5.338078291814947

1399237,2,B000056OCJ,"The majority of the MGM DVDs in the James Bond series are geared to die-hard fans and have much to recommend them, but the MOONRAKER DVD is below par.
The first mistake is the commentary by Executive Producer  Michael Wilson, Associate Producer William Cartlidge, script writer  Christopher Wood and director Lewis Gilbert.  Not one of them seems to have  done the simplest home work of watching the video prior to the taping so no  anecdotes had been prepared ahead of time.  We therefore get a lot of  wasted time of 4 people talking over each other, trying to remember events  of 20 years ago and saying things only they would understand.  Gilbert  especially seems confused, alhtough he is in much better form on THE SPY  WHO LOVED ME DVD commentary.  The John Cork produced commentaries on most  of the other recent Bond DVD releases are much superior.
While MOONRAKER  has some sumptious sets and beatiful photography - and alos some witty  one-liners from Wood, it tries to copy the successful elements of THE SPY  WHO LOVED ME but falls way short on plot and character.  The film seems to  be a lot of time and money spent for the wrong things.  Despite the fact  that it was a big box office smash, it is telling that the filmmakers went  in the opposite direction for the next series entry FOR YOUR EYES ONLY",959385600,,1318,4.594827586206897
1399238,4,B000056OCJ,I have to admit that Moonraker is very far fetched and i can see why alot of people don't like it. I think only true 007 can enjoy this. Jaws' return is nice. The film is fun and a great entry into the Bond series. I cannot  wait to buy this dvd when i get the money. Moonraker rules. I love this  movie!,958435200,,304,3.8095238095238093
1399239,4,B000056OCJ,"Hated by most hard core Bond fans who like the Fleming novels (which I may add, would be the death of the Bond series if it HAD followed the novels), Moonraker was the first Bond movie I saw in its entirety and it hooked me  to 007. Afterward, I went to see every film that came before it, and after  it.
It must be remember that there are many Bond fans out there who did  not became fans because of Dr. No or From Russia WIth Love. In fact, many  fans today were not even born when they first came out. Moonraker may be a  low point to a Bond fan who started out with Dr. No or Goldfinger. But a  great adventure to people who have no initial knowledge of who and what 007  is all about, like I was.
The space laser battle is a bit silly, the plan  to destroy the human population is far-fetch. But hey, I was in Junior High  school at the time and had the time of my life!
Once again, great score  by John Barry, great performance by the ever reliable Shirley Bassey, great  lunar titles by Maurice Binder, and a special mention to Corinne Clery, who  gave a great performance as Corinne Dufour. She outshined Lois Chiles' icy  Holly Goodhead even though she disappeared half an hour into the film.",958348800,,1201,4.192139737991266
1399240,2,B000056OCJ,"Bond in space?  I didn't believe it, I didn't think it should happen, but I saw it and lets just say that I have a better understanding of why many viewers dislike the Moore era Bonds.  MOONRAKER starts grand with it's  pre-title opening, but ends up plummeting to earth afterward getting worse  and worse.  We only get into space in the closing or so and by that time  the Atari computers took over.  Bond (Moore) is to locate the dissapearance  of a space shuttle that was highjacked in midair during a delivery.  After  going to California, Venice and Rio, we learn that it's owner, one  idustrialist named Hugo Drax (Micheal Lonsdale) stole it himself for his  Hileresque plot.  Drax will take his ""perfect human species"" to  his hidden space station with his space shuttles and then saturate Earth  with a deadly nerve gas, killing everybody and allow him to live with his  perfect people back on Earth in peace.  Bond and an operative named Holly  Goodhead need to work together and tag along to the station and foil the  plan before it's too late at the same time trying to stay out of the grasp  of steel mouthed hitman Jaws (still Richard Kiel)who I might add finds a  little girlfriend of his own as well as a speaking part in this adventure.  Don't worry though, Bond also has help from the U.S. and it's LASER GUN  toting Space Marines!  The action scenes felt a little on the tired side  this time, Jaws isn't NEARLY as much fun to watch and in fact is quite  ridiculous now, even more so with the extremely unnecessary girlfriend  addition.  As for Drax, he's got an evil plan and attitude to go with it,  thats something anyway.  MOONRAKER to sum it up is a rather corny and only  mildly fun way to spend the dreary Saturday afternoon-a very dreary  Saturday afternoon.  It just kept me entertained.  The back of the older  boxes for the film even told us that STAR WARS was a good reason why this  movie was made-hopping on the sci-fi bandwagon.  All I can say in closing  is that I hope that when I grow up....I can be a Space Marine too.",958003200,,2055,4.454054054054054
1399241,2,B000056OCJ,"""Moonraker"" (1979) has little to do with James Bond and everything to do with Looney Toons. The 007 producers have turned Richard Kiel's once-menacing Jaws into Wile E. Coyote. Roger Moore sleepwalks through the whole thing, occasionally stepping aside for the usual plethora of stunt doubles. To be fair, the pre-credit sequence is quite good and Drax remains a truly memorable villain. Otherwise, a definite low point in the Bond series.",957916800,,439,5.197183098591549
1399242,4,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker, the 11th James Bond adventure is truly under rated but one of the best. This time Bond (played by Roger Moore) is up against Hugo Drax, a mad man obsessed with the conquest of space. Bond travels from Venice  Italy, to South America and even to space to stop Drax from distroying the  human race and replacing it with his own perfect specimens. Also Jaws, an 8  foot tall giant, is Drax's new henchman. Only problem is he isn't in it  enough. This was also the last Bond movie with the original M. This Bond  film might have been the most under rated of all 19 films, but it's still  one of my favorites.",957657600,,615,4.304347826086956

1399244,1,B000056OCJ,"This by far has to be Roger Moore's worst James Bond film. Obviously released at the height of the Star Wars craze, this movie is just plain sad. The special effects are laughable and the love scene between Jaws and  the girl who looks like the Swiss Miss, is just so incredibly stupid that  it's just embarrassing to watch. This is probably the worst adaption from  Ian Flemings original novels since ""On Her Majesty's Secret  Service"". If you want to see a decent Bond film with Roger Moore in it  buy ""Live and Let Die"" or ""The Man with the Golden  Gun"". Avoid this waste of celluloid like the plague. It's a shame they  didn't wait 'til now to do ""Moonraker'. With all the new advances in  technology and special effects, they could probably do a smashing film.  Unfortunately, we're stuck with this.",956793600,,804,4.566433566433567
1399245,5,B000056OCJ,"James Bond once again returns in ""Moonraker,"" one of the most succesfull Bond films in the series.  I personally enjoy this movie because Bond has to save the world from extinction.  Bond's enemy here is Hugo Drax, a person who wants to rebuild the world with a race of superhumans,  which he has selected to re-inhabit the world.  This is one of my personal  favorites because it takes Bond and the Bond lead, Holly Goodhead, into  space to stop Drax and his deadly plan.  Bond uncovers what will happen in  Venice, Italy, and in the beautiful location of Rio de Janiero.  When Bond  and Goodhead are in Rio, they find out where the products are heading, into  space.
In ""Moonraker,"" it will be nice to see how MGM/UA  specially enhanced this classic Bond DVD, since it was released when DVD  was available to the market back in 1998.  I love this movie very much, set  apart from the fact that other people think that this is a cheesy  ""TSWLM"" remake.  I really don't think that ""Moonraker""  is that type of movie.  I think that ""Moonraker"" is a movie where  Bond has to protect the world from the human race becoming extinct.  Bond  has to go out into space to do that, because Drax sends his deadly probes  from his space station orbiting the earth.
I'm really looking forward to  this movie coming out to DVD.  I really enjoy watching this movie and am  anxious to watch it on the widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  It will be neat  to learn more about the movie from the ""Inside 'Moonraker'""  documentary as well as the audio commentary tracks available on this  Special Edition.  I recommend this movie to all Bond fans who are looking  to complete their DVD collection, such as myself.  It's a good edition to  your James Bond DVD collection.",956361600,,1748,4.550161812297735

Roger Moore is superb as ever, and his pure Englishness is why he was so  special, (he is the only Englishman ever to play Bond, Connery is Scottish,  Lazenby an Aussie, Dalton Welsh and Brosnan is Irish). Enjoy this film for  what it is, don't laugh at its shortcomings. Its fun, and never tries to  take itself to seriously. Have Fun, Watch MOONRAKER",951350400,,637,4.448275862068965
1399250,5,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker is Roger Moore 4TH and best Bond movie. Jaws amazingly come back from the previous Bond movie, The Spy Who Loved Me, and in Moonraker he servives boating off a waterfall, falling off a plane into a circus tent,  and being in a crashing cable car. Roger Moore is very humorous and says  lots jokes. In Drax's space staition, he tries to create a world in space  and kill everyone on the Earth. Can Bond stop Drax and Jaws this time?",951264000,,441,4.353658536585366
1399251,5,B000056OCJ,"What's left for me to say. Mr Paul Joyce says it all in his review. This is a great film with a good plot and great locations.  One thing a must say is: Stop the silly complains about Roger Moore being tired and uncommited.  I think Roger Moore hold on with grace a lot better than Sean Coonery did  as James Bond 007. I really love Sean Coonery as James Bond but if there's  one Bond that got tired it's definitely Connery. I think his acting is  tired in his last two Bond films ""You only live twice"" and  ""Diamonds are forever"". It's a huge difference compared to his  burning, exiting performance in Thunderball two years earlier. In Connerys  first four films you really felt that he is Bond. In his last two it feels  like he's just doing it like a rutin. Like a job. A little slide from the  subject here but like I said; Read Paul Joyce's rewiew, it says it all.",950227200,,870,4.218181818181818
1399262,3,B000056OCJ,"This film is full of inconsistencies.  My favourite example is when Drax tries to have Bond killed with an anaconda in a swimming pool.  Bond kills the anaconda, but then Drax's henchman, Jaws, shows up and pulls Bond out  of the pool, to make him appear before Drax.  Had the scenario had any  consistency at all, Jaws would have kept Bond's head under water long  enough to make him drown.  They wanted to kill him, didn't they?  But this  death would not have been spectacular enough for the audience.  No, Drax  absolutely had to make Bond burn alive under a space shuttle during takeoff  (and of course, Bond escapes).  I am not saying that other Bond films are  perfect, and that their scenarios are consistent from beginning to end, but  this one is far from being one of the best.  The idea of Drax's desire to  create a ""perfect race"" was good (for it provides the opportunity  to show lots of pretty women, as is expected of any Bond film, and a plot  for the film), but the rest of the movie is made of nothing new.  In fact I  see this film more as a parody of ""Star Wars"", which was released  two years before, than as a genuine Bond film.",950054400,,1152,4.334905660377358

The films is filled with very obvious  product-placement,and some damn silly jokes(Watch out for ""Also sprach  Zarathustra""as a hunter's retreat,and the theme to Close Encounters of  third Kind as a doorcode.)It does have one of the series best  villains(Lonsdale)and it's first half-hour is very good indeed.

1399265,5,B000056OCJ,"The fact that Moonraker remains one of the most unpopular Bond movies is a real travesty. Moonraker is a brilliantly conceived attempt to bring 007 into the sci-fi world, i.e. the one realm he hasn't yet conquered: space.  The film glides smoothly from one action sequence to another, connected by  a solid plotline and truly exotic locations. The casting is well spot-on:  Roger Moore(my favourite) as Bond, Michael Lonsdale as the demented Hugo  Drax, Lois Chiles plays astronaut/CIA agent Holly Goodhead with  distinction, and Corinne Clery is excellent as Drax's aide Corinne Dufour -  who helps Bond when he visits Drax Industries, but sadly pays the ultimate  price for it. Moonraker also features one of the most sinister plots in the  series: Drax plans to wipe out the world's population with an ultra-deadly  nerve gas dispersed from outer space, and then replace it with his own  ""master"" race. Of course it sounds insane, but insane storylines  like this are what keeps the Bond franchise going. The use of light-hearted  humour also reaches its peak here, and it connects brilliantly with Moore's  style of acting.

It has a great plot on how criminal mastermind  Hugo Drax hijacked a few space shuttles and prepares to make purification  with extermination! It also includes the best of all henchmen and most  popular one, Jaws, the 7 foot giant with steel teeth. This also includes  great action scenes all around the world. Many people think it's the worst  Bond movie, I don't. It's probaly the best. Rent it, you will like it.",946512000,,592,4.297297297297297
1399267,3,B000056OCJ,"Moonraker is perhaps the most lighthearted of the Bond series, which is good or bad, depending on your taste.  Richard Kiel returns as the hapless giant assassin Jaws, and is the main source of comic relief for the film.  I always chuckle every time he and Bond encounter each other and the looks  they exchange before Jaws tries to kill him.  Lois Chiles' Holly Goodhead  is one of the more attractive and intelligent of the Bond girls.  There is  also a beautiful dusky Brazilian agent who unfortunately is relegated to a  minor role in the film.  The villain, Drax, is the extreme personification  of the Malthusian/environmental population control advocates who views  humanity as a cancer on the planet and has devised a way to kill off  mankind while perserving the animal and plant life.  Moonraker takes Bond  and the viewer to a variety of exotic locales - Venice, Rio de Janeiro and  outer space itself.  My main problem with Moonraker is its inconsistency  with the way Drax and his henchmen deal with James Bond.  First they try to  kill him with unnecessarily absurd methods, like the knife thrower emerging  from a coffin on a gondola or a giant snake in a pond, and then when the  assassination attempt fails, they simply take Bond prisoner.  A bullet  through the brain would have more than sufficed.  Then again, there would  have been no movie.  The Bond movies are essentially male escapist fantasy,  which means that just as with our heroic daydreams, logic must sometimes  bow to absurdity.  Moonraker has all of the ingredients a successful Bond  film requires, a beautiful female agent (Dr. Goodhead), a despicable  villain (Drax), not one, but two henchmen (Chau and Jaws), interesting  gadgets (the wrist activated dart gun, the boat/hang glider, and the  gondola with wheels) and the exotic locations.  Whether or not you like  this movie depends on if you are a fan of the Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote  cartoons, with Bond as the Road Runner and Jaws as Wile E. Coyote.",945216000,,1994,4.830357142857143

It isn't the best of the James Bond films, not in my humble opinion, but it was a lot of fun. Moonraker pays homage to what was contemporary at the time, adding a space battle with lasers. It also features a Bond leading lady who takes her place among the most capable and outrageously named of his paramours, Dr. Holly Goodhead.

The special effects are so spectacular, they're almost over the top and comedic. The story features a larger than life villain with a grandiose scheme and beautiful women whom add to the otherworldy atmosphere of the film as much as the scenes in space.

This particular Bond film has three very distinct female characters who stand out among the many in 007s missions. Theres Dr. Holly Goodhead, whom I mentioned, who stands with Triple X and Pussy Galore in both her glamour and her ability to hold her own. We have Manuela, in the middle of the movie, who has my vote for one of the most beautiful Bond women ever, making a striking presence in the film. Last, weve got Corrine Dufonte, one of the most tragic of Bonds romantic interests who comes to one of the most horrific ends Ive ever seen in this particular franchise.

Weve also got one of the most memorable of the Roger Moore villainous sidekicks returning to serve a new boss. Jaws is alternately scary, comedic, and sometimes both. The fate he meets is almost ridiculously sweet with the right woman turning him into a new man.

The plot of this particular movie isn't my favorite. Certain moments are taken to extremes which are almost too much. Others are predictable. It does feature some memorable moments dear to my heart, such as Bonds moment with the python. Jawss moments were fun, almost vampiric, if at times a bit much, but enjoyable. This was Bernard Shaws last appearance as M, in which he shows that as much as 007 irritates him, he has his agents back.

Predicatable, at times too much, at others, surprisingly beautiful, this movie delivers what Id expect of a Bond film. For overall enjoyment, I give it 3 stars.",1515974400,,2133,4.647214854111406
