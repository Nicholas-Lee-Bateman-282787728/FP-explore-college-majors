8406085,5,B0035G39JK,"This film is essentially about family, secrets, unresolved issues, the meaning of ""home"" and love. I related to a few of the events, especially going home and reverting back to the way you were when you were young.
I think this would make a great series, but might be too painful for a general audience. It's hard to face parts of your life you've been hiding from for years, maybe decades. But it's never too late.",1499990400,,415,4.473684210526316
8406086,5,B0035G39JK,"A trio of sisters, two of whom have left Australia due to a traumatic event in their lives (not revealed til the end), reunite after one writes a brilliant and  transparently autographical book based on their life, leading to healing that is long overdue. It is beautifully written and acted. This movie is for someone who wants to understand what makes people tick, and what determines the course of  lives, particularly female ones. The action in this movie is all within the characters, who are as a whole appealing, a family one would like to spend some time with.",1491264000,3,568,4.7272727272727275
8406087,5,B0035G39JK,"Excellent script, acting was great especially by Joan Plowright who has always been a favorite of mine.
I would have liked to purchase this on DVD but Amazon did not have the English translation--such a Pity!!!",1491177600,2,210,4.861111111111111
