8223838,4,B000WMDSUK,"This movie is great for the targeted audience- young girls that love horses. And there are Pony Club members in the scene at the ferry waiting in cars. Contrary to another reviewer,  the villain does not die. Filmed in Norway and Pennsylvania,  the senery is stunning and adds to pleasure of watching. If you are not in the targeted audience,  you will find things to criticize, like any movie that wasn't made for you.",1456617600,,419,4.635135135135135
8223839,5,B000WMDSUK,"i have been looking for this dvd since the manufacturer went out of business and i lost this one. I am 13 and this dvd came in a package with the clubs magazine and other gifts.(WHEN IT WAS IN CLUB) It was called the Pony Club. Like i said, i lost mine and i was so excited to finally be able to watch it again. I reccomend to any one who loves horses like me. Another reviewer said there was a ""villain"". There are no scary monsters or villains in this dvd...I LOVE THIS!!!!",1397088000,,475,4.0638297872340425

8223841,3,B000WMDSUK,"Although it isn't my kind of movie, young girls might find it interesting.
For me the action drags and dramatic scenes are flat. I found myself dreading
what will come next after the mine cave-in that kills the villain.
For me this movie just wasn't entertaining.
It was painful for me to review this.",1211760000,,301,4.592592592592593
