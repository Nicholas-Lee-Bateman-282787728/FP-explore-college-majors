2875906,5,B000RW3Z1C,"The ""missing rings"" versions the NFL Network is starting to release give me hope that someday we will get more content like this on years when the 'Skins didn't go all the way.
1972- Went to Super Bowl VII
1983- Went to Super Bowl XVIII, dominant and very entertaining all year long
1984- ravaged by injuries, the 'Skins win 6 of their last 7 games, including 4th quarter comebacks over the Cowboys and Cardinals in weeks 15 & 16 to win the division. Art Monk sets the record for catches in a season.
1986- The 'Skins go 12-4, but they can't beat the Giants. Schroeder's one full season as starter, and he looks great at times. Several fun games.
1990- A late season surge inspired by Art Monk puts the 'Skins into the playoffs and leads to their dominant '91 Super Bowl championship team.
1999- Shoot-outs galore, as the Norv Turner-led 'Skins win the division and beat the Lions in the playoffs before losing to the Bucs by 1 point.
2005- Gibbs era II's best season, as they win their last 5 games to take a playoff spot and then beat the Bucs in Tampa.
2007- The end of Gibbs II. The tragic death of Sean Taylor inspires the 'Skins to victories in their final 4 games and a playoff berth.",1222387200,9,1191,4.393665158371041
2875907,2,B000RW3Z1C,"These discs are so heavily copy-protected that they wouldn't play in my DVD player, making these the first perfectly undamaged DVDs that refused to do so. The back of the box carries a disclaimer warning that the discs will only play in ""licensed DVD players,"" whatever that means. Once I borrowed my roommate's computer to watch them, I was impressed by the quality of the documentaries and the great bonus footage. Too bad the manufacturer wants so badly to ""protect"" me from even playing my purchase on my own system. Extremely unsatisfying, buyer beware.",1192492800,21,558,4.946808510638298
