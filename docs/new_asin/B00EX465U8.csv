5948976,5,B00EX465U8,I love history and this movie is some how close as to what the old warriors of that area used to be or rsther still are!,1386028800,,120,3.6538461538461537
5948977,4,B00EX465U8,"The story is much like Red Dawn:  a small band of teenagers saves their nation from an invading super-power.

Very well made, e.g., the acting, casting, settings and costumes were really impressive.  The story was good, but often implausible and somewhat formulaic.

I was surprised to see a feminist influence in a Kazakhstan movie.  There was a female ""warrior"", and her strength equaled or excelled the men's--a feminist delusion that only exists in movies.

The landscape scenes and horsemanship were wonderful.

Overall, a nice Friday-night movie.",1385683200,2,552,5.348837209302325
5948978,3,B00EX465U8,"First. It is all in sub-titles which would have been nice to know before I paid for it. (I would not have bought it if I knew that).
Not a bad movie. Think a light steppe version of braveheart.",1385510400,3,193,3.9743589743589745
5948979,3,B00EX465U8,"Everything about this movie was great, but it just failed miserably to take off and fly. I don't know how it could have failed, with its competent acting, good action, story, good plot and subplots, and it even had a spine that should have carried it. But it didn't. It seemed like every scene just subsumed into the next scene and then went away. With just a bit of nuancing there was plenty of room for passion, conflict, romance, mystery, suspense, and all the rest. But it just never happened.

Anyways...good movie to watch and absorb the sights, historicity, and nice filming.

See it, if you're not busy.

5948980,3,B00EX465U8,A good movie.  I really don't like action type movies with subtitles with few exceptions.  This should be mentioned on the movies' order page.,1385078400,6,142,4.875
5948981,2,B00EX465U8,I ordered this and started to watch it and after 1 min turned it off.  Not only was it subtitled which I didn't see mentioned in the ad but the subtitles went by so fast you couldn't read them.  I was excited to watch it because it was what I liked but what completely disappointed.  I'd rather watch it with the mouths not matching the words than what I found in this presentation.  Very disappointed!,1383091200,3,402,4.32
5948982,5,B00EX465U8,"This was a pretty good movie. Much better than I expected. The filming location of this movie was nice.
This movie shows the realism of the life in the steppes. The story plot was good. The violent combat, romance and betrayal
kept me interested in the movie. I recommend this movie.",1382400000,18,283,4.568627450980392

5948984,5,B00EX465U8,"I checked this out on a whim and found myself drawn into a story I had never really expected.  Two different nations of people with similar methods of horseback warfare clashing on the steppes of Russia. Kazakhstan, Kazakhs versus Mongols! I'm not sure just how accurate all the historical data used is, but I really got caught up in the cruelty of the age and the realization that this was between eastern and middle eastern cultures! The characters gave no apology to their ways of life and there was a feel of stepping back to a time I'd never imagined.",1382054400,36,556,4.56

an interesting blend of the mythic and a realistic / historical sense.

One can only marvel at the verisimilitude of the battle scenes, the quality of everyone's acting, the overall direction of this film.

Great look at some history and way of life in a part of the world many of us have had little or no exposure to.  My wife and  both enjoyed the story.  If I had one complaint, it would be about the subtitles.  The wording was well done but often the yellow script would just sort of disappear into the background scenery and be difficult to read.

5949020,4,B00EX465U8,"Reasonably well done.  Good actors for the most part.  Transitions are a bit rough, but the story moves along.  There's more of a story in the build up than the promised big battle at the end.  However, that is understandable since the battle and its hero are a national legend.",1463961600,,278,4.5
5949021,3,B00EX465U8,"Very fun. I think I missed a lot in not knowing the history of the steppe region's warring classes. I am, however, now motivated to learn more about these famous hose people. The plot was a bit difficult to follow. The actual movie-making was naive, but virtuous. What I enjoyed was the look into a very unfamiliar culture for most westerners. The dress and ways of life were spell-binding. If you could suspend reality and questioning for a bit the reward was lovely. I may even watch it again for it's uniqueness. I would recommend this movie to many different types of viewers. There was something for everyone in this tidy insight into a great cultural and isolated culture.",1463875200,,678,4.705882352941177

5949028,4,B00EX465U8,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie.  The scenery was incredibly beautiful, and the movie does a wonderful job making it feel like you're stepping back into that time and place in the past.  The characters were also very well done.  But, I will say that parts of the story didn't seem to flow together as smoothly as they could have, and occasionally, characters disappeared without explanation, then they reappeared later and it seemed like the audience was expect to know exactly what they'd been doing in the meantime. Moreover, it would have been nice to have the relationships between the characters spelled out a little more clearly early on, such as who was related to whom, and whether or not titles like"" brother"" were literal, or meant to denote friendship.  I also had to smile at some of the subtitles. I have no idea how the actual lines were written as I couldn't understand the spoken language, but seeing lines like, ""These are my guys,"" and ""Take it easy,"" did seem out of place in an otherwise historical film.  Still, it was a good story with some great battles and some very good plot twists, and I would recommend it.  A quick note for anyone who is wondering: there is some gore in this film.  I have seen worse, and they didn't seem to focus on it all the time, but they don't shy away from showing blood or wounds, so you may want to take that into consideration if you're sensitive to it.",1462060800,,1407,4.537549407114624

5949059,5,B00EX465U8,"Fabulous cinematography, great acting, dramatic action.  Every modern director--especially, perhaps, Asians and those dealing with Asia--has internalized the work of Kurosawa.  This film, which often feels like a high-level samurai epic, has craftsmanship and an artistic vision to equal the great Japanese director.  And the plot and historical context resonates with the spirit of struggles of national and ethnic liberation from all times and places.  A film on a plane with Braveheart or Glory.  As with the Westerns of John Ford and other top-ranked directors, the landscape itself becomes a character, shaping the action and emanating an almost personal presence.
Perhaps the only drawback is that the audience is assumed to know more about the history than the average Westerner would know.  But this only motivates a viewer to go online and do some research.

5949084,4,B00EX465U8,It was a good watch and a part of history of a culture I had never read or knew about. So I had to do a little research afterwards and read more about the events of this movie that really took place. The scenery was awesome and a great filming.,1425945600,,244,3.9
5949085,5,B00EX465U8,"The story tells of a time, long after the Mongol Empire had retreated back to their homeland, leaving behind the many tribal clans they had brought with them when they moved west to conquer and the continual clan rivalry that existed there for centuries but before the coming of Soviet Russia and of Kazakhstans eventual bid for independence when the Soviet Union dissolved. Primitive black powder rifles were in use but the lance and the bow and the sword were still the predominant weapons on the battle field and war was still being fought much like Genghis Khan had taught them.
The story also has a personal tale to tell, about a young man whose clan was destroyed and of the band of loyal misfits and heroes that gathered about him for protection. It is a tale not unlike the personal history of Genghis Khan, himself. It will possibly serve as the national epic of Kazakhstan on film.
I was greatly impressed with all of the production values of this film. First, the cinematography was excellent, stunning, bringing to the screen the feel of the far expanse of the steppes surrounded by lofty mountains all around. The costuming was precise and exact in every detail. Nothing was spared to make this film believable. There was even a department dedicated just to the aging of the leather costumes. The tale brought forth a depth of Kazakh culture and lifestyle that I have not seen in any previous movie, before. The music was authentically Mongol and as such was haunting and appropriate every time. The only complaint I have concerns the subtitle and translations. I suspect that the actors were saying great and moving things but the translations provided were tame and boring, robbing each scene of the intensity I am sure the actors were trying to portray. Also, the subtitles move just a little too fast for me. I don't know much about the Kazakh school of acting but I liked these young and old actors who seemed comfortable in their parts and were able to convey their characters professionally and most important, believably. All in all, a good film I would recommend to those who are tired of the usual foreign film trying too hard to look like a Hollywood production. This film was Kazakh made, Kazakh told and Kazakh acted and if this is the level of film making coming out of the Republic of Kazakhstan, then I think we are all in for a treat in the future.",1425945600,12,2378,4.664285714285715

In the end, the Chinese Han and the Kazaks exterminated the Dzungars some time after the historical period of this movie - one of the earliest documented genocides.  So I guess it all depends on your viewpoint, but I gather they were a tough aggressive bunch, which is why the Chinese final got fed up and organized their bloody end.",1413849600,6,515,4.576086956521739

Absolutely breathtaking and Alpine. The narrative structure is strong, keeping the story flowing smoothly. The actors are all native Kazakhs, portraying what must be an accurate visual image of life in the time of warring Mongol tribesmen, complete with yurts, village scenes and epic battles without any evident cgi. ON the other side, as might be expected from a local production, character development and plot continuity are sufficient but not necessarily well developed. Therefore, scenes depicting grief are contained in single instances of loud crying, or heaving rocks as a sign of frustration. Otherwise, the movie was valuable if only to see the faces of those who inhabit this remote region of the earth, in native dress and style, from a time when fabled horsemen rode their durable ponies over endless steppes and ultimately helped shape the destiny of the world.",1386547200,,1037,5.178571428571429
