793143,5,6304107366,"One of the most romantic episodes in the excellent Faerie Tale Theatre series, this one is the classic rags-to-riches story of Cinderella. Jennifer Beals beautifully portrays the role of Cinderella, and Matthew Broderick makes a delightfully witty Prince Henry. The appearances of Jean Stapleton as the fairy godmother and Eve Arden as the wicked stepmother are superb. The costumes, sets and music are truly divine in this wonderful faerie tale.",1076457600,8,446,5.385714285714286
793144,5,6304107366,I loved watching these movies on TV as a kid and still do. I did hear that they are trying to get them on DVD. I hope they do. I would like that very much! I wish more and more kids would get into liking movies like these instead of the ones on now a days. I highly recommand all of the Faerie Tale Theatre movies.,1064966400,4,314,3.772727272727273
793145,5,6304107366,"I didn't catch this series when it first ran on TV but I was introduced to it whyen I rented some videos. This show has it all. Big name stars and directors, whimsical set design and (usually) some very funny comedy.
My two favorites are without a doubt The Emperor's New Clothes and The Three Little Pigs. The first stars Art Carney as one of the con men trying to dupe the king in a way we are all familiar with. 3 Little Pigs has Billy Crystal as a pig and Jeff Goldblum as the Wolf. Goldblum is hysterical with his silly makeup and huge tail.
It's a shame that this series has gone out of print since I am certain it would find new fans, especially with the upswing in the fantasy genre lately. If anyone is listening, why not re-release on VHS or (be still my heart) DVD.",1009584000,19,776,4.18
793146,5,6304107366,"This video is incredibly enchanting!  I love fairy tales and watching videos of them.  This has got to be the best one ever made of ""Cinderella"".  Jennifer Beals is just outstanding, and Jean  Stapleton gives the video humor.  A must-see and buy for any home video  collection for the family.",921283200,2,292,4.74

793267,5,6304107366,Jennifer Beals is just a stunning actor!  She even shows how talented she is in this dramatic play/show.  It seems as if most of her movies stem from how she is perceived by others about who she is in this world.  She is just extraordinarily talented and smart.,1378857600,,261,4.395833333333333
793268,5,6304107366,"I loved this version of Cinderella as a child, and was so happy to see it here! It came quickly and was exactly as I remembered it! Will not disappoint if you like old-school 80's style movies :)",1372809600,,195,4.157894736842105
793269,4,6304107366,"I was obsessed with this movie when I was little!  Cinderella was my favorite fairy tale and I loved this live action version.  Watching it again as an adult, I found it to still be entertaining, though a little cheesy in parts.  Jean Stapleton is great in her role as a fairy godmother and Jennifer Beals is endearing as Cinderella, who during one fairly sobering narrative comes across as relatable woman and not a fairy tale character.",1370736000,,438,4.662337662337662

793325,5,6304107366,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Cinderella"" more than lives up to the series' stellar legacy of creative fairytale adaptations.  Featuring a cast which includes Jennifer Beals, Jean Stapleton and Matthew Broderick it shines with intelligence and romance.

It even subtly improves on the Disney classic by giving the prince a proper name; that of Henry.  Jennifer Beals does admirable work as the title heroine, humanizing(as much as she can)one of the archetypal figures in mythical storytelling.  Matthew Broderick infuses Prince Henry with undeniable charm while still maintaining a palpable shyness which perceptively suits the character as he finds true love.  Jean Stapleton's boisterous Fairy Godmother befits the character's role as an agent for dynamic change in the story.

Also featuring Eve Arden and Edie McClurg as, respectively, the stepmother and one of the stepsisters, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Cinderella"" is a unique telling of the story which stands up to many viewings.",1263513600,,995,5.549668874172186
793326,5,6304107366,"My two kids (ages 4 & 6) find this Faerie Tale Theatre series hit or miss - some they really enjoy and others not so much.  But this one - Cinderella - is their favorite (and my favorite, too!)  It's the basic Cinderella story, but the characters are entertaining and well acted.  Enjoy!",1258588800,,287,4.377358490566038
793327,5,6304107366,"I used to watch this movie with my sister when we were kids and I was so pleased to find it on DVD.  I remember thinking that it was so funny.  It has been years since I have seen it, and watching it again was a great walk down memory lane.  Even though I don't think that is't hilarious anymore, I still enjoyed it very much.  I am so excited to share this movie with my kids as well.",1177027200,2,385,3.8354430379746836
793328,5,6304107366,I fell in love with this show when I was 5 or 6 years old. I thought Matthew Broderick was so cute as the prince. I recently watched it and it still makes me laugh out loud even though I've seen it a bunch of times. It's very humorous and a treat for anyone of any age.,1113955200,3,269,3.736842105263158
793329,5,6304107366,"As an avid reader of fairy tales and a collector of Cinderella and Cinderella spin-off movies, I must say this one has won its place as my all-time favorite. Matthew Broderick and Jennifer Beals make the perfect on-screen couple, and Jean Stapleton is absolutely hilarious as a sort of ""countrified"" fairy godmother. This movie goes beyond a childhood tale and provides entertainment that everyone can enjoy, regardless of age. It's about time this wonderful movie was put on DVD. If you like this one, you might try some of the other Fairy Tale Theatre movies, as they all incorporate humorous twists to traditional fairy tales. I especially enjoyed watching The Dancing Princesses, but what can I say, I still enjoy Cinderella the best. Also, if you enjoy Matthew Broderick's performance, you might like seeing him in Ladyhawke, where he puts in an absolutely hilarious performance as a pickpocket named Mouse. Jean Stapleton also plays in Fairy Tale Theatre's Jack and the Beanstalk as the giant's wife. Her performance in that movie is almost as good as her performance in Cinderella, and the movie is well worth watching. And finally, if you enjoy humorous versions of fairy tales, I recommend another video: Into the Woods. It is a blending of fairy tales in a two-part stage play, but the Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood scenes are hilarious.",1100736000,17,1355,4.973568281938326
793330,5,6304107366,"I must agree with the other reviewer that this is one of the best Faerie Tale Theatre presentations. Having been an admirer of these wonderful films for some years, I recently bought the whole series and this is the first one that I revisited. As always the production values are of a high standard and the whole thing has been put together with such affection that it simply can't miss. Jennifer Beals is excellent as Cinderella, giving the character real bite, while Jean Stapleton is quite simply outstanding as the Fairy Godmother. In fact the whole cast is fabulous. I would recommend this title to anyone without reservation! It's great having this charming series on dvd at last - not before time!!!",1099094400,14,706,4.795081967213115
793331,5,6304107366,"FAERIE TALE THEATRE's imaginative and beautiful retelling of CINDERELLA is one of the best in the entire series. With Jennifer Beals leading the exceptional cast in the title role, it makes for magical entertainment.

Cinderella (Jennifer Beals) leads a life of drudgery and unhappiness at the hands of her wicked stepmother (Eve Arden) and her stepsisters Arlene and Bertha (Jane Alden and Edie McClurg). When the dashing Prince Henry (Matthew Broderick) invites all the eligible maidens in the kingdom to the Autumn Ball, Cinderella naturally wishes to go too. Too bad she's dressed in rags and doesn't have a coach. But she does have a Fairy Godmother (Jean Stapleton) who'll see that Cinderella's every dream comes true...

With a romantic musical score and fine performances all around, CINDERELLA comes to vivid life in this superb FAERIE TALE THEATRE installment. Highly-recommended.",1098403200,13,890,5.35
793332,4,6304107366,"I haven't seen this movie since my childhood, but I am desperately searching for a copy.  It is a sweet account of the cinderella story, and to this day, every time I see Matthew Broderick in a film, I call him my Prince Charming.  I recommend this to children and anyone else wanting memories of their childhood in the 80s.",1093996800,2,324,4.383333333333334
793333,5,6304107366,What happens when you have Jennifer Beals playing Cinderella and Jean Stapleton as the fairy godmother?  MAGIC!!!  This is a wonderful film in the Faerie Tale Theatre series.  Each actor/actress gives very memorable performances from Matthew Broderick playing the prince who is looking for love to Eve Arden who plays the unfair dictating stepmother.  A perfect family film.  A movie that no family or fan of fantasy should be without!,1086480000,,435,5.1571428571428575

7862927,5,6304107366,"I particularly liked the rabbit part ;) The video quality and lighting is a bit disconcerting and low quality, however I enjoyed the dialog, the playful banter, and the fairygodmother is fun with her southern accent if only because it's so out of place.
