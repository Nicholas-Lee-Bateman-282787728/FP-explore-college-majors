4707180,3,B005HZCLXC,"I enjoyed several aspects of this movie. The script is smart and funny. The plot device of having the deceased wife show up from time to time to give advice to her still grieving husband is fairly original and works well. The consideration of the emotions we experience when we don't want to betray those we have loved and lost by moving on is nuanced and thought provoking. And I enjoyed the open and unembarrassed references to God and church throughout the movie, which are not at all heavy-handed.

So what's not to like? For me, it is that far too many elements of the characters' lives are glamorous or successful beyond what is typical for normal folks. The main character--the widowed husband--has apparently retired at the age of 43 and lives in an enormous, beautifully furnished house and is tall and handsome to boot. His college-age daughter also lives in a large, beautifully furnished home while attending school and is perky, loving and cute. The father's eventual girlfriend likewise lives in a giant, beautifully appointed home and has the looks and figure of a super model. And the daughter's boyfriend is athletic, on his way to Yale medical school, a great cook, and radiantly selfless enough to enjoy singing in retirement homes and hospitals on a regular basis. And I've not even mentioned the brand new, spotless cars these characters drive.

This is not real life for 99% of the people on our planet, myself included. I find it hard to identify with characters portrayed in this way, and I think the movie could have been much richer (ironically) if it had taken the same story and placed it in a more realistic setting.

For a great faith-based, romantic, family film that is funny and very engaging in its portrait of real American life, I recommend ""What If.""",1333065600,26,1787,4.776699029126213
4707181,5,B005HZCLXC,"This movie is fun to watch.  A regular appearance by husband's deceased wife makes you pay attention to what is going on.  Romantic, comedy and decent movie.  Enjoyed it.",1330041600,,170,4.793103448275862
4707182,5,B005HZCLXC,"I find no faults with this movie,'cept it could be longer.

All the actors did really well in their parts.  Each character pulled off his/her parts with style.  Everyone seemed to fit and were comforable in the clothes they were cast in. The movie moved in a pretty logical pace... perhaps it could have been slower but time constraints of the movie's format determined many things.

Dad was perfect in his feelings as a dad and actions of a dad.  He matured nicely...
Dad's new squeeze is a bute!  Terribly wise and just the right character for dad to bounce off of.
The daughter was cute and cuddley as needed and grown up at just the right times.
The boyfriend;  well, he was hard to take at first but also matured with time. (Just like the script-writers wanted.)

I can't tell you more about other characters....No give-aways needed. But there is one I wish I could have known in real life...
this character has the whole cookie jar as far as I'm concerned.  The character was a perfect best friend for dad.

4707190,5,B005HZCLXC,"I was almost 30 minutes into this movie before I realized that it was a Christian film, and then it wasn't because I was having Christianity beaten over my head, it was because of an almost off-handed remark by one of the characters.  It was nice.  This is a nice movie.  The story is interesting and drew me in.  I cared about the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen.

The story portrayed people with Christian faith as real people with real problems.  It wasn't sappy or so sugary-sweet that you felt like you were going to stick to the floor.  It was just a movie about a man coming to terms with his wife's death and the engagement of his daughter while acknowledging that God was part of his life and the lives of the people around him.  They weren't weird and they didn't talk with a southern accent, they just identified as wanting to be a man following after God's desire.  Again, it was nice.

I have to admit, I desperately wanted to take both Ned and David to a stylist and get haircuts for both of them, but that certainly didn't distract (too much) from my enjoyment of the film.  You should watch this movie.  It's sweet and charming and fun and I would certainly hold it up to most of the movies I see these days.

One last note, the movie really makes me want to visit Midway, Utah.  It looks like such a beautiful place.",1521331200,2,1356,4.308300395256917

4707245,4,B005HZCLXC,"As a young widow going on four years now, and still in love with my husband, I definitely connected with the Dad in the movie. If you have been blessed with a long-term, wonderful marriage that ends far too soon and worse yet abruptly, it does take a long time to even think about loving again let alone dating. Even at three years, I wasn't ready to date, so I connected with his reluctance, and I did often ""talk"" to my husband -- it's comforting. The Dad and deceased wife were the most endearing parts of the movie, they demonstrated what I often feel, and I'm certain other widow/ers will connect. The score and two songs by Hillary Weeks were awesome and gave the movie feeling. The rest of it, as others have stated, is lackluster. The takeaway for me was that yes, some people can and should move on; it's not weird to talk to someone who has passed; and it's not wrong to still love them several years out. And if love should come along, and one is ready, it's never too late to give it a try.",1500940800,7,1002,4.278947368421052

4707263,4,B005HZCLXC,"This movie is about a man in his 40's who has lost his wife to cancer three years prior. While the movie shows his departed wife talking to him throughout the movie, other people can't see her there, he just feels  her there and talks with her to help him figure out his own thoughts. Their daughter is in college and has found her special someone. It is hard for the dad to move on and to allow his daughter to be so grown up and his deceased wife to move on to heaven (which is waiting for her). This movie is about working his way through that and making a new life for himself, moving on. I understand this man. I would not be able to move on either, if my love were no longer there and it's hard to let his daughter move on when he feels she is all he has left.

The scenery in this movie is absolutely beautiful. Midway is every bit as lovely as it is depicted. He is in a very nice place, financially, which may make it hard for some people to connect with the movie. Of course, since I am from this area, I love seeing familiar landmarks, restaurants, etc., in the movie. Nobody says in their reviews how obnoxious the jogging lady is who wants to date him though. WAY too forward. Would have turned me RIGHT off.

The acting is okay in this movie, not the best, but okay. The first time I watched this movie, I barely hung on, just for the scenery (and maybe for his cool vehicles). However, I have watched it several times now and it actually touches my heart quite deeply and I truly hope to never be in his situation. It is a sweet and touching movie. Since I've seen it, I will put it on when I am preparing dinner sometimes because I don't have to give it my full attention, since I've seen it. I usually will find myself watching it too much and working a little slower than I could be. I have grown to really love this movie and feel it. If you don't pick it apart, it's an easy movie to enjoy. Give it a chance and you may enjoy it as much as I do.",1495843200,18,1965,4.059278350515464

It's not clear what ""Heaven is Waiting"" for.  Maybe for him to move on?  But don't let the unanswered question bother you.

There are some unbelievable situations and I would have had the lines fleshed out to make it more believeable but overall I enjoyed this film nevertheless.  It's true, not for young college kids...geared mostly for those in the 40's which I find really refreshing. Too many movies, I'm noticing now are in the HS kids or young college age ranges - a true sign that I'm maturing now and wanting mature films. Strange how Hollywood kind of ignores the 40/50 years old romances - what gives -- suddenly we're not important. What the heck?!

The mystery of whether life after death truly exists, a subject pondered over by kings, scientists, mystics, and scholars for ages, is finally revealed.  From out of the mouth of babes comes the unprompted truth.  It is said that young children can remember snippets of their life before birth, but their memories gradually fade, usually before they gain the ability to gather thoughts and place them into adult words.  However, some children can revert to their prenatal surroundings in times of stress.  This may be the case for the little boy in the movie.  ""Heaven is Waiting"" is a film for the whole family, and one that would be even more rewarding when viewed together with those you love.",1470787200,2,763,4.742424242424242

4707585,4,B005HZCLXC,"This is in response to another review:  This review completely misses the point of the movie--which is to tell the story about a man coming to terms with the loss of his wife, and the grief associated with it.  Besides, there are plenty of movies out there in which the main characters are living in financial circumstances that well exceed that of the general public.  It's all about giving viewers a chance to enjoy a FANTASY WORLD for just a little while.  Esthetic beauty can be a great comfort to people like me, who are very visual.  I LOVED this movie (the father's dry humor was delightful!) and I very much appreciated the comforting theme (as did my husband) that we can eventually get beyond grieving to a place of happiness, even joy.  Also, the mountain scenery/views in this movie was AMAZING.",1401494400,,807,4.647887323943662

4707592,5,B005HZCLXC,"I must agree with the 5 Star Ratings for this movie.

I enjoyed Waiting for Heaven because it is an independent, unique, original, and tasteful production about ""everyday"" people who have survived difficult life events that have forever changed their lives and rearranged their expectations for the future. This story is about hope, love, and being brave enough to believe that the former two can be experienced again after undergoing a terrible loss.

Specifically, the grieving process was one of the movie's main themes. Although completely honest about the main character's struggle, fearlessly showing Ned, the main character, in the throws of a potentially disconcerting psychosis of frequently speaking to and consulting with an individual no longer a part of his current reality, this film somehow achieves light-hearted and good-natured... And not to fear, there are redemptive signs that promise Ned will find a happy ending despite facing the inevitable challenges of losing a loved one. In fact, one of the most endearing and positive aspects of this film is that the lost loved one, Kate, is included throughout the plot's development, preserving her memory and lending insight into her character's legacy. Carol's character tells Ned that one of the things she likes about him is that he loved Kate so much. I believe that the writers did this purposely to provide cohesion and to hint at the importance of Kate's life; she is not lost nor forgotten, and Ned is able to heal. Kate's memory and life strengthens Ned, enabling him to love again, as Carol's character enters Ned's life in a big way. This film tackles a lot of important and complex issues effortlessly, remaining both realistic and consistently hopeful.

I have to disagree with one reviewer's statement that the characters are one-dimensional; to the contrary, the characters all undergo important development throughout the film.

Curt Doussett did a wonderful job. The audience is given a window into his character's (Ned's) story and can appreciate the spiritual lessons learned through the quality of this actor's work.

Waiting for Heaven is not ""mainstream,"" but it does have a lot to offer (maybe more so, indeed). This is a clean, meaningful, sweet, and ethereal film to add to one's collection...  I actually wish that there had been another film to follow after this one so that we could have seen more of Midland and more of Carol and Ned's characters.

If you watch this movie, you will not regret it... It's unusually delightful and soulful, and you will feel better after you've watched it, no matter where you are in life.",1358035200,3,2616,5.05568445475638
4707593,5,B005HZCLXC,I would highly recommed. real. thought provoking. totally relatable. experienced loss? it can be heartbreaking. It's a process not best rushed. there IS hope. tenderly written. worth the purchace.. take a look..,1341532800,,211,5.625
4707594,2,B005HZCLXC,"There is nothing inherently bad about this movie, but that doesn't exactly make it worth watching. All in all, it was a very vague, undefined, cliched story.

1) as far as I can tell, there isn't really much of a message to the story...
2) the plot is extremely one-dimensional. The first half of the movie is the story of a protective father who doesn't like his daughter's ""perfect"" suitor - not a terribly original plot device. The second half is about the man's daughter trying to convince him to date this slightly creepy woman who he does not like, when he's not ready to date at all. It mentions that the man is a pastor, but that doesn't play into the plot a bit - there is no mention of God, no ""working through grief"" overtone, and not even any church patrons are involved.
3) the script/dialogue was stilted and also rather one-dimensional
4) the characters were also one-dimensional. The only thing I know about the man is that he misses his wife and is protective of his daughter (things that can be said of any widower). The only thing I know about his daughter is that she is selfish for springing a boyfriend on her dad with no warning, and she loves her boyfriend (things that can be said about the majority of college-aged girls). And the only thing I know about the slightly creepy woman is that she likes to jog and hates book clubs.
5) the acting was awkward and flat, especially at the beginning

If you're looking for a movie to have playing in the background while you're doing something else, this one's great, because the sound-track is soothing, and you don't have to worry about anyone getting sucked in and thus distracted.",1333843200,12,1652,4.540268456375839
