5923785,5,B00EJSMOVW,Was always a great TV police drama when I was a child. I will watch it all the time !!!,1388448000,,87,3.4
5923786,5,B00EJSMOVW,My friends & I watched this show religiously ... and always discussed the episodes the day after they aired. Brings back good memories ...  and  this show stands out as one of my favorites from that era ...,1388275200,,206,4.394736842105263
5923787,5,B00EJSMOVW,"Finallly able to purchase. Some old imperfections in quality of episodes, but it just makes me feel like I am watching it on our old console tv again.",1387411200,,150,4.392857142857143
5923788,5,B00EJSMOVW,I watched the mod squad as a teenager and loved the show..I was happy when it became available on dvd..Television today is no match for the classic tv shows of years ago..I have the four seasons of mod squad and looking forward to the fifth season..I did preorder the fourth season but was disappointed that it wasn't available so I went to amazon Canada and purchased it there since they are region one,1383523200,2,403,4.534246575342466
5923789,1,B00EJSMOVW,"Just like with the Mary Tyler Show, I see they released the entire show in one box set and did NOT yet release the final season individually, hence completely screwing the true fans who bought the first few seasons individually.  As of Oct 13, 2013 there is no mention on Amazon for the last season (5) of the Mod Squad separately, yet the Box Set with it is coming out in a couple of weeks and can be pre-ordered. Let's hope just like the MTM Show, there are enough complaints so fans who bought the seasons already individually (seasons 1 to 4), do not have to now buy the entire Box Set, just to get the last season (5th).",1382745600,4,625,4.2521008403361344
5923790,5,B00EJSMOVW,"I'm seeing reviews of Mod Squad season 4 from here in the states and I'm assuming these people are like me and have seen these episodes but are still waiting to own the DVDs as they appear to have never been distubuted to this country since the release date of OCT 1. TMS is an underrated and misunderstood show as people's first reaction when it's brought up in discussion is to mock the gimmick of 'young cops' and they have a prejudice about the silly excesses of the 60s that they naturally attach to this show. This series actually has serious drama, great writing and acting and no one has  more heart melting, spirit raising, natural beauty than Peggy Lipton, in my considered opinion. Season 4 has some stars you'll recognize like Milton Berle, Leslie Nielson, Martin Sheen and the late Andy Griffith.",1382400000,4,809,4.6573426573426575
5923791,5,B00EJSMOVW,"Mod Squad is timeless.  So glad that the remaining seasons are being released!  Great buy for a terrific TV Show!  Recommend to anyone!!! A Must Buy!!!

5923793,5,B00EJSMOVW,"My husband and I LOVE The Mod Squad!  It's one of our all-time-most-favorite TV shows, and we wish the show had run more seasons.  We are very grateful, though, that it's being made into DVD's.  We would recommend these DVD's to anyone who likes quality, wholesome entertainment.",1380672000,5,279,4.8936170212765955
8606089,5,B00EJSMOVW,I LOVE THE DVD OF THE MOD SQUAD ALL THE SEASON 1 TO 7,1504569600,,53,2.857142857142857

8606092,5,B00EJSMOVW,One of my favorite all time series.  Great buy and fast delivery.  Bought all 7 seasons.  Thank you.,1467244800,,100,4.444444444444445
8606093,5,B00EJSMOVW,"I love this show growing up, and it is fun to look back at all the old episodes.",1414540800,,80,3.5
8606094,4,B00EJSMOVW,"Season 4 (just finished viewing most of it) seems to have fallen into the rote category--going through the motions a bit. The actors are still fresh and interesting but the formulaic scripts sometimes lag. It is still fun to watch for those who dig 60's culture. I bought Season 5 to complete the set. The worst part of Seasons 3-5, also mentioned by other reviewers, is the poor transfer quality to DVD. Grainy, faded colors, artifacts at times--not great for viewing. I recommend you download VLC Media Player (free--and the best media player out there). Turn on DeInterlace (on the Video tab--located near the bottom of the drop-down menu) and play around with DeInterLace Mode until you get the best picture. It does help. You must first start the DVD before the Video Menu will allow you to make changes.

Peace, man.",1409961600,,822,4.788732394366197
8606095,5,B00EJSMOVW,My fav season. Some real stand out episodes.,1405641600,,44,4.625
8606096,5,B00EJSMOVW,Loved it. The stories were great and I love how they always have each others backs. They know how to work together as a team.,1392595200,,125,4.04
8606097,2,B00EJSMOVW,"Just like season 5 volume 2, I have bad spots where the DVD skips. After having the problems with the other discs, I decided to keep them because I knew it wouldn't be any better",1390435200,,178,4.114285714285714
8606098,3,B00EJSMOVW,"This has the same issues has volume 2. Editing was poor on picture and sound. Especially in the opening credits. Although I love the show, it's to bad that this company did not take the same time that CBS did as I mentioned in the other review, when seasons 1 and , were released.. Also the vol 1 and 2 set-up is a rip. They could of made it all in one volume. Further, It's also annoying to see what  each episode is about when its behind the sleeve of the disk. You have to keep puling it up and down. Its starts to wear on the cover, and like to keep my discs in the original case. One last thing one of my discs dislodged, when the set arrived, which can cause damage to the disk, luckily nothing happened. They should have some folder things flops in to the keep the discs secure, as its to cumbersome to put discs back in forth. I do not want to keep handling discs. I do not need to handle. The cases holders are very cheap. I only give a three because of the issues mentioned. The show is a wonderful 5. Thanks.",1389312000,,1019,4.069651741293533
