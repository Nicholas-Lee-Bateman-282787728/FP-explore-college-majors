2990275,5,B000WQWPSW,"This, the third season, includes the all-time classic episodes ""Password"" (Jack Klugman's favorite), ""The Odd Monks"", ""I Gotta Be Me"" and ""Take My Furniture, Please"". As with previous Odd Couple DVD sets, CBS/Paramount has done a stellar job transferring the episodes: extremely fine detail, made from clear prints with even, saturated colors. The picture is far better than even the best broadcasts and VHS transfers I've seen in the past. All neatly bundled in a thin 4-disc case with nice menus. As far as edits, I'd rather have these great shows with a few seconds of edits than not at all. All the episodes are over 25 minutes which is about 3 minutes longer than almost any syndication cut I've ever seen. A great show, well presented. Simply a must-have for classic TV fans.",1201132800,3,781,4.835820895522388
2990276,1,B000WQWPSW,"There is a disclaimer on the box that warns that these episodes are edited; however, I was hoping they would be minimal as in the previous two releases.  They are not minimal and many episodes are unwatchable for knowledgeable fans. I'm not in agreement with those who say that edited versions are better than nothing.  Because of the disclaimer, I cannot return this item, as I would like; however, this is the last season of this show that I'll buy. What a shame for Paramount to show such contempt for its customers.",1201046400,31,519,4.630434782608695
2990277,2,B000WQWPSW,"I was thrilled to hear that season three of The Odd Couple was being released.  It is my favorite TV show of all time, and I have the first two seasons which were released in near perfect condition.  However, the same isn't true for season three.

Season three sees The Odd Couple butchered like never before.  It's a shame that fans might never again see the episodes in their original form.  As a big fan of classic TV, I feel like I've put up with this long enough.  I bought season one of The Cosby Show and Roseanne -- both edited -- and all four edited seasons of ALF.  I even went so far as to purchase WKRP.  But this one takes the cake.  There is no way I am putting down good money for an edited set of The Odd Couple.

So long Oscar and Felix.",1201046400,30,754,4.068027210884353
2990278,3,B000WQWPSW,"Sad to say, but possibly the greatest TV sitcom ever is getting hacked for DVD release. Season 1 of the Odd Couple on DVD was perfect -- no cuts. Season 2 was near-perfect -- only a couple of pieces of incidental music were changed.

But sure enough, there are serious cuts this season that make viewing less enjoyable. The worst: the famous ""role reversal"" has its closing punchline cut off. The show stops when Felix says ""I believe I sing better than you, Oscar."" We don't get to see the bit where Felix sings ""Cocktails for Two"" and Oscar shuts him in the closet. Parts of Felix singing are also cut from at least two other episodes.

Three stars because the shows are still great and the total cuts on the season seem to be about two minutes. Still, this does not bode well for future seasons: Felix's band playing the square dance ... Paul Williams ... Laugh, Clown, Laugh ... Jaye P. Morgan ... Roy Clark ... Those episodes will be ruined if the music is cut.",1200960000,56,966,4.421348314606742
2990279,4,B000WQWPSW,"Having not been released yet, I'll just say, for those of us over 40....the ""Password"" episode alone may be worth the price.",1200009600,3,124,4.681818181818182
2990280,3,B000WQWPSW,Just saw a picture of the rear box art for season three and once again there is a disclamer from Paramount about edited episodes  and music changes. The Odd Couple is one of my favorite TV shows and season three was a great season but its really disturbing that Paramount will not give us the complete unedited original music versions. So far only season one escaped this and that was the only season not originally released by Paramount. Of all the companies that release TV shows on DVD Paramount is by far the worst as far as music changes are concerned.,1197072000,20,557,4.514851485148514
2990281,5,B000WQWPSW,"I have been an Odd Couple fan for over 30 years. When i was a kid we used to watch the show and it was funny. As i grew up we watched the show in reruns and thought it was great. This is the only television show which I can watch over and over again and never get tired of it and also never stop laughing. It has taken a long time for these shows to come out on DVD and I only hope that all of the seasons are produced. It would have been the ultimate for me if all of the seasons had been released in on package, all seasons all at once.

If you enjoy comedy and if you like to laugh, get the Odd Couple, the funniest show that was ever on TV.",1193443200,3,644,3.7007299270072993
2990282,5,B000WQWPSW,"When I was a kid, I didn't care much for The Odd Couple. After watching the first two seasons on DVD, I'm completely addicted. It's such a great simple premise and it works because Klugman and Randall inhabit their characters. And what flashy clothes Tony wears. Perhaps this show never got lame because it was always on the edge of being canceled. They never could get lazy. I do hope the folks at Paramount put out all five seasons with the same speed as Hogan's Heroes. Unlike so many sitcoms, this one had a good closing episode.

Every time I look, the price gets lower on all seasons and on the complete set.  I would say by the end of the year or maybe next spring, they will stop making it.  They only lower the price a lot when they have overstock.  With all the shows today, a 45 year old show is yesterday's news.  The episodes are still funny.  Besides, do you really remember every second of the show?",1407369600,,478,4.075268817204301
2990322,5,B000WQWPSW,"Excellent! I loved watching ""The Odd Couple"" when I was a child. It only gets better because now I can watch it as an adult anytime I want. I recommend purchasing this DVD collection. The third season was a great one!",1404691200,,217,4.317073170731708
2990323,5,B000WQWPSW,"On this third season, the Odd Couple seems to have been at its high water mark of great humor. Not only are Tony Randall and Jack Klugman at their best, but so are Penny Marshall as Myrna and Al Molinaro as Murray. There are more hits than misses for sure, but my favorites are I Gotta Be Me, Murray Who Came to Dinner, Gloria Hallelujah, Princess, Odd Monks, The Odd Couples, First Baby, Password, and Don't Believe in Roomers.  We get role reversal, Murray moves in, Oscar will date Felix's ex-wife, they will befriend a Princess, both will join a monastery, they will all pretend to still be married, Felix will get banned from a hospital, the guys will go on a game-show, a strange lady moves in, Penny Marshall steals her scenes on camera, Felix overdoes everything, Oscar is still a grouchy slob . Classic TV at its best !",1404345600,,828,4.483443708609271
2990324,5,B000WQWPSW,"The series is great but as some afficianados have pointed out, some little things were cut out that only the truest of fans would notice, other than that, it's great!",1403395200,,166,4.566666666666666
2990335,4,B000WQWPSW,"In this sitcom that ran on ABC from 1970-75, this 1971-72 Season of THE ODD COUPLE and best season yet; the coarse and crude sportswriter Oscar Madison(Jack Klugman) is dubbed--by a princess, no less--as ""Sir Oscar, Nicest of the Nice Guys.""

His roommate, best friend, and consummate pest, Felix Unger(Tony Randall) tells him at one humbling point, ""Oscar, you're well above average."" Exploring Oscar's softer side no doubt helped earn Jack Klugman an Emmy Award for this season, but rest assured, not all of Oscar's edges have been smoothed out.

Oscar is still a slob, his room is still a disaster area, and he is still quick to erupt, which is understandable. As obsessive and overbearing Felix himself states, ""I drive everybody crazy. I never learn my lesson.""

In one of the series' most fondly remembered episodes, ""My Strife in Court"" , Felix humiliates Oscar in court after he gets them both arrested for scalping theatre tickets. In another fan favorite, ""Password,"" Oscar and Felix are a washout on the classic game show, thanks to Felix's arcane clues (""Aristophanes"" for the password ""bird"").

In ""Gloria, Hallelujah,"" jealous Felix goes to great lengths to prove he's not when Oscar is matched with Felix's ex-wife, Gloria (Janis Hansen), for a computer date. All of which helps make the episode ""I Gotta Be Me"" so much fun, as the constantly bickering duo try their hand at role reversal with Oscar kvetching and fussing, and Felix trashing a dinner party with beer and cheap cigars. In the third season, Penny Marshall (brother Garry wrote several episodes), as Oscar's secretary, Myrna, and Al Molinaro as hangdog cop, Murray, are given more prominent roles.

In some odd stunt casting, Monty Hall guest stars as himself in the episode ""Let's Make a Deal,"" and Howard Cosell proves to be an excellent foil for Oscar and Felix in ""Big Mouth."" Jack Klugman's ex-wife(Bret Sommers) makes a welcome return as Oscar's dread ex-wife(Blanche Madison) in ""The Odd Couples,"" in which Oscar and Blanche must pretend they are still married for the benefit of Oscar's tradition-bound mother.

Elinor Donahue as Felix's girlfriend(Miriam) with a live studio audience to cheer the actors on, this season provides several show-stopping moments, from Felix and Murray performing a little Gilbert & Sullivan in ""Gloria, Hallelujah"" to Myrna's spectacular tap dance in ""Myrna's Debut.""

THE ODD COUPLE still currently runs on ME-TV and I used to sometimes watch this show in reruns on TV Land too.",1400544000,,2497,5.0608272506082725
2990336,1,B000WQWPSW,Thank You to all the reviewers who warned me about this. I'm a musician and realize the importance of timing. Tony Randall and Jack Klugman had near perfect timing and their portrayal of Felix and Oscar. I didn't like hearing that Paramount decided to edit what was already a great season. I can't understand why people fix things that aren't broken? They undoubtedly had to pay copyright royalties on some of the other music. Why they chose to cut segments to avoid this for this season is beyond me? I doubt though that will ever be a real release of the original third season. What a pity for a classic situation comedy with two very fine actors. Rest in peace Tony and Jack.,1397692800,4,678,4.520325203252033

2990341,5,B000WQWPSW,"The laughs continue in Season Three of ""The Odd Couple"". Felix & Oscar embark on a cruise in the episode ""Sometimes A Great Ocean"" - where Felix tries to get Oscar to change his poor eating habits. Oscar insists he appear in Felix's first television commercial in ""Felix's First Commercial"", & when Oscar's mother visits, Oscar & Felix have to pretend they're still married to Blanche & Gloria, respectively. Oscar stumbles in wordsmanship & has writer's block in the episode ""I'm Dying of Unger"" & Howard Cosell guest-stars in the episode ""Big Mouth"", where Oscar & ""Howie"" go at it. Monty Hall also guest stars in the episode titled ""Let's Make A Deal"", where Felix & Oscar appear as contestants on the classic game show. Felix gets thrown out of the hospital during the birth of his daughter in ""The First Baby"". Oscar gets audited by the IRS in the episode ""The Ides of April. Allen Ludden guest-stars in the episode ""Password"", where Oscar & Felix appear on yet another classic game show, where Felix is certain he & Oscar will win. Season Three is yet another season complete with hilarity & there's a little drama mixed in between. ""The Odd Couple - The Third Season"" would be a wise purchase to make, so make sure to add it to your must-have DVD library today!

This was some of the best work for both and the world deserves to see their chemistry as they originally intended it to be seen. P'mount will find a whole new audience waiting to purchase these, so it would be worth their while to do so.

2990359,4,B000WQWPSW,"Well written with superb performances from Jack K., Tony R. and most of the supporting cast.  Sure, it's an old series made for a US audience but the 70's styles and occasional US-specific gag does not diminish the real enjoyment and delights of this comic masterpiece.  Beware Season 1.  ""The first season of the show was quite different from the ones that followed. It was filmed using only one camera, and used a laugh track instead of a studio audience. Many characters from the original play appeared in the show but, when the second season began, many were eliminated and the show filmed in front of a live studio audience with three cameras"". Though the performances and writing are good, the absence of a live audience, the single camera and a laugh track do make the experience rather less joyous.  Try starting with Season 2.  By the time you have finished season 5, you may be so desperate to see more of Jack and Tony that Season 1's failings become unimportant.",1260662400,4,974,4.6725146198830405

2990362,4,B000WQWPSW,"This DVD is great, except for one factor.  Some of the episodes are edited, probably due to protection from lawsuits.  All episodes that have songs (such as ""In Some Secluded Rendezvous"" and ""Peg of My Heart"") have the songs omitted.  Devoted Odd Couple fans (such as this reviewer) will love having this great show in our collection but the omissions are an obvious drawback.  Had I known about the omissions, I still would have bought the DVD, even though the disappointment is a great one.  Fortunately, most episodes are shown in their entirety.

2990368,4,B000WQWPSW,"First of all, I am a HUGE fan of THE ODD COUPLE and this show has been one of my most eagerly anticipated on DVD forever. I'm not going to say that I am thrilled about the song edits regarding Season Three, but the truth is that while I easily noticed two of the cuts, I was surprised to learn here that there were actually more... meaning, they were not always glaringly obvious and seldom take away from the enjoyment of this classic comedy show. There are so many funny things to love about the series that you just have to grin and bear it. Some people have said that their TV recordings retain some of the music cues, but at what cost? Losing some other sections of the show? Those syndication episodes are not 100% complete either, and are probably missing MORE than these DVDs are. Since the upcoming last two seasons of THE ODD COUPLE rely heavily on their music for the very flow of the stories, perhaps Paramount is skimping a bit on Season 3 so that they can devote the money to Seasons 4 and 5, where such missing music truly renders the episodes incomprehensible. Lastly, what do any of you hope to accomplish by skipping the purchase of this season? Paramount has been great at getting these DVDs released quickly at this point, and it looks like they're going to do the entire run -- so stop the whining. It's not like they're going to go back and re-edit and re-release Season 3 just to keep you happy. And by not buying it you're only hurting yourselves and shooting yourselves in the foot. Hey, I don't like incomplete episodes any more than you do, but maybe we just have to face the fact that some complete episodes as they were originally broadcast in the 1970s when they first aired may be ""lost"" when it comes to the DVD world.  What alternatives do you have -- to hold onto your crummy-looking syndicated tapes?? They may have the music cues, but they're cut elsewhere too.",1208390400,6,1897,4.4511494252873565

Cut!!!!  Preposterous.  Who is so tight that they'd take offense to Tony Randall singing a bar or two of a song????

2990374,1,B000WQWPSW,"I had been waiting for years for the Odd Couple to be released on DVD, and when they finally came out I was ecstatic.  I bought Seasons 1 & 2 as soon as they hit the shelves and I enjoyed them alot, and didn't even notice any of the supposed cuts or music changes, possibly because they were very subtle.  Not the case with Season 3.  The cuts are very noticeable, and really take away from my enjoyment of seeing the episodes again.  I was really shocked by this.  I can't imagine how much it would have cost Paramount to pay for the right to use a line or two from some old songs, but I'm sure the $34.99 everyone paid for the DVDs would help cover the cost and leave us all alot happier.
As one other reviewer said, what will happen with some of the later episodes?  There are a few that revolve around music especially those with Felix's band the Sophisticados, and the Paul Willam's episode.  Will these episodes be cut to bits?  This type of greed is unacceptable and I will not be buying any future sets of The Odd Couple I'm sad to say. What a diasappointment.",1203292800,34,1068,4.252475247524752

One thing for certain, I am NOT rushing out to buy any more seasons until I am assured that I am purchasing FULL UN-EDITED episodes.

2990388,5,B000WQWPSW,"To start with I had no idea there were edits. Usually I am sensitive to that type of thing but since I just completed the entire season and didn't notice, I'm just not concerned.

As far as the title of this review; I like Klugman's Madison but in the realm of classic TV Tony Randall's Felix Unger IS the Odd Couple. He ranks up there with the greats.. Carney, Knotts, you name 'em. His delivery is lyrical, his enthusiasm is practically unparalleled in all of TV. For me, this season was a slow starter but really hit it's stride around disc 2, from there it only gains strength.

Sometimes classic TV shows like this lose something as the years go by, I have bought my fair share of yester-duds, but the Odd Couple is one of those diamonds that shine brighter as the years go by, transfer included. If you are passing on this because of edits it's your loss. There is so much comedy crammed on these 4 discs it's amazing to me still you can buy a complete season of anything, let alone the classics, and they aren't more than $50.",1201996800,4,1033,4.347150259067358
2990389,1,B000WQWPSW,"Once again, CBS/Paramount has screwed up another TV show on DVD. The second season of Happy Days on DVD was the worst example of corporate greed I have ever seen. Now they have done the same shoddy work to The Odd Couple. To be fair, the quality of the film transfer is excellent, even on a 42"" LCD TV. But sadly, many episodes are edited. I have copies of taped episodes from syndication which have scenes not included in this DVD. One example is ""Oscar's Birthday"" when his dance teacher is introduced. On the syndicated version , she comes out and tap dances all around Oscar much to his embarrassment. But on these butchered DVDs, her whole dance sequence is cut out, probably because she is dancing while Murray is singing to a song that Paramount wouldn't buy the rights for. Another obvious edit is the final scene of ""I Gotta Be Me"" when Felix says he sings better than Oscar. On the original episode he starts to sing ""Cocktails For Two"" when Oscar shuts him in the closet. The song is cut from the DVDs. I guess CBS/Paramount can't afford to pay the royalties for a 74 year old song. It's a shame that for the price of these DVD sets, we cannot get the original episodes as they aired. I guess we are at the mercy of stingy billionaire companies!",1201910400,29,1256,4.418103448275862
2990390,1,B000WQWPSW,"I can't even begin to explain the disappointent in this DVD set. Odd Couple fans have been waiting for decades for this series to be released on DVD. When they finally get around to it, they give us these inexcusable edited versions. I have counted at least five episodes with deleted, changed, or shortened scenes, due to someone (usually Felix) singing a few lines from a song. (""Sweet mystery of life"" from 'The Odyssey Couple'; ""Secluded Rondevoux"" from 'Role Reversal'; ""Sun in the morning.."", from 'Murry who came to Dinner'; ""Look for the Silver Lining"" from 'The Odd Monks', and ""Peg of my heart"" from 'The Odd Couples')

I think someone owes true fans of the series an explanation. Other than here, where can we register our complaints? The sad fact is, if we do, instead of correcting them, they will probably respond by not releasing the 4th and 5th seasons. Shame on Paramount!

How sad.

Scenes that were funny and added to the episode. I don't know why ANYTHING would be deleted from these DVD versions. I foolishly thought by purchasing the DVD I would be getting full uncut episodes.

as far as the people upset by the episode edits,they are 100% correct. and to add to the misery is the $40 list price. sony shows like 'all in the family','sanford and son'  etc are only $30 list.

As with previous Odd Couple DVD sets, CBS/Paramount has done a stellar job transferring the episodes: extremely fine detail, made from clear prints with even, saturated colors. The picture is far better than even the best broadcasts and VHS transfers I've seen in the past. All neatly bundled in a thin 4-disc case with nice menus. As far as edits, I'd rather have these great shows with a few seconds of edits than not at all.

Season three sees The Odd Couple butchered like never before.  It's a shame that fans might never again see the episodes in their original form.  As a big fan of classic TV, I feel like I've put up with this long enough.  I bought season one of The Cosby Show and Roseanne -- both edited -- and all four edited seasons of ALF.

But sure enough, there are serious cuts this season that make viewing less enjoyable. The worst: the famous ""role reversal"" has its closing punchline cut off. The show stops when Felix says ""I believe I sing better than you, Oscar."" We don't get to see the bit where Felix sings ""Cocktails for Two"" and Oscar shuts him in the closet. Parts of Felix singing are also cut from at least two other episodes.

Three stars because the shows are still great and the total cuts on the season seem to be about two minutes. Still, this does not bode well for future seasons: Felix's band playing the square dance ... Paul Williams ... Laugh, Clown, Laugh ... Jaye P. Morgan ... Roy Clark ...

3224832,4,B000WQWPSW,"In this sitcom that ran on ABC from 1970-75, this 1971-72 Season of THE ODD COUPLE and best season yet; the coarse and crude sportswriter Oscar Madison(Jack Klugman) is dubbed--by a princess, no less--as ""Sir Oscar, Nicest of the Nice Guys.""

His roommate, best friend, and consummate pest, Felix Unger(Tony Randall) tells him at one humbling point, ""Oscar, you're well above average."" Exploring Oscar's softer side no doubt helped earn Jack Klugman an Emmy Award for this season, but rest assured, not all of Oscar's edges have been smoothed out.

Oscar is still a slob, his room is still a disaster area, and he is still quick to erupt, which is understandable. As obsessive and overbearing Felix himself states, ""I drive everybody crazy. I never learn my lesson.""

In one of the series' most fondly remembered episodes, ""My Strife in Court"" , Felix humiliates Oscar in court after he gets them both arrested for scalping theatre tickets. In another fan favorite, ""Password,"" Oscar and Felix are a washout on the classic game show, thanks to Felix's arcane clues (""Aristophanes"" for the password ""bird"").

In ""Gloria, Hallelujah,"" jealous Felix goes to great lengths to prove he's not when Oscar is matched with Felix's ex-wife, Gloria (Janis Hansen), for a computer date. All of which helps make the episode ""I Gotta Be Me"" so much fun, as the constantly bickering duo try their hand at role reversal with Oscar kvetching and fussing, and Felix trashing a dinner party with beer and cheap cigars. In the third season, Penny Marshall (brother Garry wrote several episodes), as Oscar's secretary, Myrna, and Al Molinaro as hangdog cop, Murray, are given more prominent roles.

In some odd stunt casting, Monty Hall guest stars as himself in the episode ""Let's Make a Deal,"" and Howard Cosell proves to be an excellent foil for Oscar and Felix in ""Big Mouth."" Jack Klugman's ex-wife(Bret Sommers) makes a welcome return as Oscar's dread ex-wife(Blanche Madison) in ""The Odd Couples,"" in which Oscar and Blanche must pretend they are still married for the benefit of Oscar's tradition-bound mother.

Elinor Donahue as Felix's girlfriend(Miriam) with a live studio audience to cheer the actors on, this season provides several show-stopping moments, from Felix and Murray performing a little Gilbert & Sullivan in ""Gloria, Hallelujah"" to Myrna's spectacular tap dance in ""Myrna's Debut.""

I can't understand why people fix things that aren't broken? They undoubtedly had to pay copyright royalties on some of the other music. Why they chose to cut segments to avoid this for this season is beyond me? I doubt though that will ever be a real release of the original third season.

This was some of the best work for both and the world deserves to see their chemistry as they originally intended it to be seen. P'mount will find a whole new audience waiting to purchase these, so it would be worth their while to do so. For me, I have too much affection for what I consider to be one of the best situation comedies ever on television to buy this butchered version, but I would gladly buy unedited episodes.",1364515200,3,530,4.474226804123711

I LOVE the Odd Couple and own Seasons 1 & 2 and wanted to purchase the rest of the seasons.  I adore Jack Klugman and Tony Randall and their artistry in portraying Oscar and Felix.  It's shameful what I hear happened with edits.  Tsk, tsk. I removed the DVDs from my Cart because I refuse to purchase them in this condition.  Thanks, everyone!

3224855,2,B000WQWPSW,"Not gonna go into detail.  If you're interested in this, you most likely are familiar with the show.  The show itself is great, but the cuts they've made are very frustrating for fans.  I just wanted to lend my voice to this.",1292889600,3,225,4.309523809523809
3224856,4,B000WQWPSW,"Well written with superb performances from Jack K., Tony R. and most of the supporting cast.  Sure, it's an old series made for a US audience but the 70's styles and occasional US-specific gag does not diminish the real enjoyment and delights of this comic masterpiece.  Beware Season 1.  ""The first season of the show was quite different from the ones that followed. It was filmed using only one camera, and used a laugh track instead of a studio audience. Many characters from the original play appeared in the show but, when the second season began, many were eliminated and the show filmed in front of a live studio audience with three cameras"". Though the performances and writing are good, the absence of a live audience, the single camera and a laugh track do make the experience rather less joyous.  Try starting with Season 2.  By the time you have finished season 5, you may be so desperate to see more of Jack and Tony that Season 1's failings become unimportant.",1260662400,4,974,4.6725146198830405

3224859,4,B000WQWPSW,"This DVD is great, except for one factor.  Some of the episodes are edited, probably due to protection from lawsuits.  All episodes that have songs (such as ""In Some Secluded Rendezvous"" and ""Peg of My Heart"") have the songs omitted.  Devoted Odd Couple fans (such as this reviewer) will love having this great show in our collection but the omissions are an obvious drawback.  Had I known about the omissions, I still would have bought the DVD, even though the disappointment is a great one.  Fortunately, most episodes are shown in their entirety.  Fans who love this show will undoubtedly appreciate all its jewels - or to paraphrase Felix from a season 3 episode - that it has a new polish, a panache.",1227398400,2,705,4.691056910569106

3224863,4,B000WQWPSW,"While I agree with those who complain about the edits, I am still thrilled by this series of DVD's because the quality is great (I feel like I'm back in 1970, watching it ""fresh"") I can't remember the last time I was able to see a totally ""uncut"" version of these shows anyway...in syndication the stations cut them to shreds....so this is still far preferable. With what I consider to be a very reasonable price for an entire season, I recommend these DVD's highly to any Odd Couple fan. And maybe someday CBS will restore the ""edited"" segments and give us all a free upgrade :)",1213142400,3,579,4.471698113207547

3224865,4,B000WQWPSW,"First of all, I am a HUGE fan of THE ODD COUPLE and this show has been one of my most eagerly anticipated on DVD forever. I'm not going to say that I am thrilled about the song edits regarding Season Three, but the truth is that while I easily noticed two of the cuts, I was surprised to learn here that there were actually more... meaning, they were not always glaringly obvious and seldom take away from the enjoyment of this classic comedy show. There are so many funny things to love about the series that you just have to grin and bear it. Some people have said that their TV recordings retain some of the music cues, but at what cost? Losing some other sections of the show? Those syndication episodes are not 100% complete either, and are probably missing MORE than these DVDs are. Since the upcoming last two seasons of THE ODD COUPLE rely heavily on their music for the very flow of the stories, perhaps Paramount is skimping a bit on Season 3 so that they can devote the money to Seasons 4 and 5, where such missing music truly renders the episodes incomprehensible. Lastly, what do any of you hope to accomplish by skipping the purchase of this season? Paramount has been great at getting these DVDs released quickly at this point, and it looks like they're going to do the entire run -- so stop the whining. It's not like they're going to go back and re-edit and re-release Season 3 just to keep you happy. And by not buying it you're only hurting yourselves and shooting yourselves in the foot. Hey, I don't like incomplete episodes any more than you do, but maybe we just have to face the fact that some complete episodes as they were originally broadcast in the 1970s when they first aired may be ""lost"" when it comes to the DVD world.  What alternatives do you have -- to hold onto your crummy-looking syndicated tapes?? They may have the music cues, but they're cut elsewhere too.",1208390400,6,1897,4.4511494252873565
3224866,3,B000WQWPSW,"I first noticed it in ""Role Reversal.""  In the original uncut episode, the episode ends with Felix saying, """"I think I sing better than you do,"" then hanging up his coat while delievering a bar or two of ""Cocktails for Two"" while Oscar slams the closet door on him, closing him in.  **Now,** the DVD ends with Felix saying ""I think I sing better than you do.""  Cut!!!!  Preposterous.  Who is so tight that they'd take offense to Tony Randall singing a bar or two of a song????  Do they think they are losing money by allowing me to hear those two bars without paying royalties?  What's next -- arresting me for humming while I walk down the street?

3224871,1,B000WQWPSW,"I had been waiting for years for the Odd Couple to be released on DVD, and when they finally came out I was ecstatic.  I bought Seasons 1 & 2 as soon as they hit the shelves and I enjoyed them alot, and didn't even notice any of the supposed cuts or music changes, possibly because they were very subtle.  Not the case with Season 3.  The cuts are very noticeable, and really take away from my enjoyment of seeing the episodes again.  I was really shocked by this.  I can't imagine how much it would have cost Paramount to pay for the right to use a line or two from some old songs, but I'm sure the $34.99 everyone paid for the DVDs would help cover the cost and leave us all alot happier.
As one other reviewer said, what will happen with some of the later episodes?  There are a few that revolve around music especially those with Felix's band the Sophisticados, and the Paul Willam's episode.  Will these episodes be cut to bits?  This type of greed is unacceptable and I will not be buying any future sets of The Odd Couple I'm sad to say. What a diasappointment.",1203292800,34,1068,4.252475247524752
3224882,2,B000WQWPSW,"I am appalled how these episodes have butcherd to delete any type of singing. My guess is that Paramount was too cheap to pay for the rights for the music. If so, give the rights to the Odd Couple BACK to Time Life! All you are doing is CHEATING true Odd Couple fans by editing some of the funniest moments from these episodes.

One thing for certain, I am NOT rushing out to buy any more seasons until I am assured that I am purchasing FULL UN-EDITED episodes.

If I wanted cut episodes, I could just wait till they are on TV Land or use my old VHStapes, and make my own DVDs.",1202774400,16,577,4.097345132743363

3224884,5,B000WQWPSW,"I love the third season, eps. The Odd Monks, but the DVD has no extras of any kind. Also, at certain times Felix opens his mouth to sing, there's an abrupt edit. I suppose it's a copyright issue on the songs he sings: ""Cocktails for Two"" and ""Look for the Silver Lining"" ??? Now THAT'S ODD!",1202083200,9,290,4.196428571428571
3224885,5,B000WQWPSW,"To start with I had no idea there were edits. Usually I am sensitive to that type of thing but since I just completed the entire season and didn't notice, I'm just not concerned.

As far as the title of this review; I like Klugman's Madison but in the realm of classic TV Tony Randall's Felix Unger IS the Odd Couple. He ranks up there with the greats.. Carney, Knotts, you name 'em. His delivery is lyrical, his enthusiasm is practically unparalleled in all of TV. For me, this season was a slow starter but really hit it's stride around disc 2, from there it only gains strength.

Sometimes classic TV shows like this lose something as the years go by, I have bought my fair share of yester-duds, but the Odd Couple is one of those diamonds that shine brighter as the years go by, transfer included. If you are passing on this because of edits it's your loss. There is so much comedy crammed on these 4 discs it's amazing to me still you can buy a complete season of anything, let alone the classics, and they aren't more than $50.",1201996800,4,1033,4.347150259067358
3224886,1,B000WQWPSW,"Once again, CBS/Paramount has screwed up another TV show on DVD. The second season of Happy Days on DVD was the worst example of corporate greed I have ever seen. Now they have done the same shoddy work to The Odd Couple. To be fair, the quality of the film transfer is excellent, even on a 42"" LCD TV. But sadly, many episodes are edited. I have copies of taped episodes from syndication which have scenes not included in this DVD. One example is ""Oscar's Birthday"" when his dance teacher is introduced. On the syndicated version , she comes out and tap dances all around Oscar much to his embarrassment. But on these butchered DVDs, her whole dance sequence is cut out, probably because she is dancing while Murray is singing to a song that Paramount wouldn't buy the rights for. Another obvious edit is the final scene of ""I Gotta Be Me"" when Felix says he sings better than Oscar. On the original episode he starts to sing ""Cocktails For Two"" when Oscar shuts him in the closet. The song is cut from the DVDs. I guess CBS/Paramount can't afford to pay the royalties for a 74 year old song. It's a shame that for the price of these DVD sets, we cannot get the original episodes as they aired. I guess we are at the mercy of stingy billionaire companies!",1201910400,29,1256,4.418103448275862
3224887,1,B000WQWPSW,"I can't even begin to explain the disappointent in this DVD set. Odd Couple fans have been waiting for decades for this series to be released on DVD. When they finally get around to it, they give us these inexcusable edited versions. I have counted at least five episodes with deleted, changed, or shortened scenes, due to someone (usually Felix) singing a few lines from a song. (""Sweet mystery of life"" from 'The Odyssey Couple'; ""Secluded Rondevoux"" from 'Role Reversal'; ""Sun in the morning.."", from 'Murry who came to Dinner'; ""Look for the Silver Lining"" from 'The Odd Monks', and ""Peg of my heart"" from 'The Odd Couples')

I think someone owes true fans of the series an explanation. Other than here, where can we register our complaints? The sad fact is, if we do, instead of correcting them, they will probably respond by not releasing the 4th and 5th seasons. Shame on Paramount!

How sad.

Also being a huge fan I was disappointed with the 3rd season DVD. I've noticed some scenes were deleted that were in when I would watch the show on TV. Scenes that were funny and added to the episode. I don't know why ANYTHING would be deleted from these DVD versions. I foolishly thought by purchasing the DVD I would be getting full uncut episodes. I understand that when old shows are aired in repeats they have to edit them a bit to allow for commercials.

as far as the people upset by the episode edits,they are 100% correct. and to add to the misery is the $40 list price. sony shows like 'all in the family','sanford and son'  etc are only $30 list.
