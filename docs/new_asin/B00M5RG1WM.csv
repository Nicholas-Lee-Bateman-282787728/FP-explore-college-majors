6561701,4,B00M5RG1WM,"This is a bittersweet story about a guy who basically is unlucky in love.  He gets out of a bad relationship and then falls into another that he writes himself into.  His hopes are dashed when the object of his affections falls for someone else.  He suffers several losses in his life and comes to terms with them, but ultimately ends up alone.  A good movie, but a little sad.",1422835200,3,377,4.3428571428571425

8670418,1,B00M5RG1WM,"I'm giving this film one star because it is categorized as a comedy. If you're looking for something funny or even romantic, this is not the movie to watch. The story line is extremely depressing.",1526428800,,196,4.628571428571429

8670420,2,B00M5RG1WM,"Amazingly idiotic film. Given the amount of effort it takes to create a movie, it is mind blowing that this one had so little to say and such vapidity.
It is ""pretty"" in a trite,  cliche way. Lots of pretty actors simpering and preening in front of the camera. Nothing to say and hollow to the core. Don't waste your time.",1504915200,,322,4.278688524590164
8670421,4,B00M5RG1WM,"This is a great looking film!  I love the locales, surprising that it's shot in Los Angeles, with a lot of unknown spots.  It's got a nice downtown New York vibe, though it's all downtown LA stuff.  The story is not for everybody I think, but I liked a lot of the intimacy between characters, whether it's with The Girl, or The Old Man.  A lot of the supporting players are really top-notch and funny, too!  I recommend as a sneak peek as to what Tom Payne is up to since he's been doing a role in The Walking Dead.",1483056000,,515,4.11

8670425,2,B00M5RG1WM,"The pretension of script writers comes through loud and clear in this zany film but, as with polytackyuns reading from teleprompters, has little or nothing to do with reality.  Another ""whuffo"" two star rating.",1468800000,,210,5.176470588235294

8670427,3,B00M5RG1WM,"Tom Payne could read a telephone book in a film and I think I'd like it. The plot started well, but I lost interest. I didn't care about any of the other characters.",1457222400,,165,4.03030303030303
