The stories are great and told with skill and sweetness.  You won't be able to resist dancing with joy and welcoming this music into the U.S. story.

3702766,5,B001MYIPZU,"It's great that PBS is making this 2008 hour-long documentary available on home video because it probably didn't get a lot of exposure on PBS TV stations outside of the Los Angeles area. Produced with a grant from the California Council on the Humanities, it wouldn't have been a big ""pledge draw"" showing in other parts of the country.

But this highly colorful and entertaining film covers an important part of the history of rock and roll music and it's timing couldn't be better with the just-passed 50th anniversary of the plane crash which killed pop idol and Mexican-American Richie Valens. His name is now in the news and this may draw folks to this film.

As narrated by actor Edward James Olmos, the film covers a wider range of Chicano artists than I knew existed. Sure there was Valens and Los Lobos. But I didn't know that Cannibal & The Headhunters - who ruled the airwaves in the 1960s with ""Land of 1000 Dances"" - or Tierra (with the 1970s smash hit ""Together"" which sounds a lot like Philly Soul) were from the East L.A. Mexican-American community. And there were even Chicano punk bands!

Producer/Writer/Director/Editor Jon Wilkman found some great archival footage and interviewed nearly every major Chicano artist - except for the late Valens - going back to the first big Chicano superstar, Lalo Guerrero, who started in the 1930s!

If you want to know the FULL history of Rock and Roll, this DVD will add tio your knowledge. Note that there are no supplemental features.

8322473,5,B001MYIPZU,"This video traces the history of Mexican American Chicano music from the 1950's to the present. A well made documentary that shows the beginning and the evolution of the East Los Angeles sounds from the artists that created the music. There are many interviews with the artists and surprising footage of Cannibal & the Headhunters as they toured with the Beatles during their first visit to America. Steve and Rudy Salas founders of Tierra, discuss how the 1968 Student Walkouts and 1970 Chicano Moratorium march against the Vietnam War influenced their writing and music. This GEM is a treasure to be seen and shared within your family and friends. This video is outstanding and should be shown in classrooms to inspire young people to be proud of who they are and to show them how the road was laid by the people that came before them.

8322477,5,B001MYIPZU,"For an hour I went down memory lane with the Oldies my cousins listened to: Richie Valens, Thee Midniters, Priemer's and others. Then we proceeded to the ELA marches, Brown Berets, and cruising to the music of Tierra, El Chicano, and Redbone.

The next era was new to me. I think I was still listening to Tierra, War, and a variety of other music when the Plugz, Los Illegals, and Brat entered the scene. Either that or I didn't listen because it was punk. Los Lobos were also included, but you won't see Santana or Linda Ronstadt as they were not LA bands.

Nonetheless, it was a fascinating movie. I hope there is an update to include '90's bands like Rage Against the Machine, Kid Frost, Lighter Shade of Brown, and other LA musicians from that time.",1318204800,2,753,4.489051094890511
8322478,4,B001MYIPZU,"Lots of nice archival film and photos...

It is clearly called ""Sounds of East Los Angeles"" but some
mention of what was happening in other parts of the
country in regard to other Chicanos making music would
have been great... Those not even mentioned or alluded to
include:

Carlos Santana (San Francisco / Tijuana)
Linda Ronstadt (Tucson, Arizona)
? and the Mysterians (Bay City, Michigan)
Freddy Fender (South Texas)
Sunny and the Sunglows (San Antonio, Texas)

to name a few...

East L.A. was wildly important but why mention Ritchie Valens
from San Fernando but not other important figures outside of
East L.A. who were simultaneously making music or continuing
to build the legacy.",1312848000,,687,5.053097345132743

I recommend this for anyone interested in roots rock from the Hispanic view.",1240444800,4,308,4.6
