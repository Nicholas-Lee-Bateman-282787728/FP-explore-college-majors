8176277,4,B000NA21YU,"We do not invest in TV so I purchased the Blue's Room Shape Detectives dvd on reputation and my daughter's mass interest in a commercial for Blue's Room on one of her other dvds.  We have become big fans of Blue's Room.  The characters are great and speak intelligently to my daughter.  It is intereactive and fun for her to watch.  Even the acter, ""Joe"", is fun to watch and doesn't monopolize the show.  On the other hand we are not as big a fans of Blue's Clues.  My daughter is not particularly interested in cartoons unless they happen to be singing (ie Backyardigans) and I find it rather demeaning to her.  I personally don't like ""Steve"".  His whole role is ""misunderstanding"" and ""lack of attention"" to the ""audience"" to where the childen on the video have to repeat themselves several times before he gets a ""clue"".  The video contains two Blue's Room and two Blue's Clues episodes.  I tend to skip over the BC.",1183593600,7,921,4.527272727272727
