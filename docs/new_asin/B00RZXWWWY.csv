8696614,5,B00RZXWWWY,"This is the best documentary on the creative process I've ever seen! From Nothing, Something takes a look at accomplished professionals from across the art world (film, music, dance, drawing, and other areas), and explores how they come up with such brilliant end-designs from nothing more than a simple idea. These people aren't just any artists, they're Oscar winners, Grammy winners, and others whose work you've probably seen, even if you didn't know you were seeing it. Highly recommended film!",1442102400,2,499,5.25
