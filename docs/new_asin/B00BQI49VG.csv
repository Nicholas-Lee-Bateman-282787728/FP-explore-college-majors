5666306,5,B00BQI49VG,"After catching this program on public TV, I wanted to buy a copy so husband could see it also.  We both found it very interesting.  The only thing I knew about plant interaction was invasive species crowding others out, so it was fascinating to learn that plants can compete and cooperate in other ways.",1369180800,21,303,4.592592592592593
5666307,5,B00BQI49VG,"There was a book written around the 50s or 60s called the secret life of plants, and this is much more researched with new technology not available back then that only supports many of their findings in a more substantial way with more information. It is a great thing for everyone to know about to show how all life works together and how important it is for us to see the human race in the light of our ecology and reduce our arrogance in humanity and spend more time and money on our humility and respect for all living organisms in our world. We can not be superior if all things that are required for the balance of nature are not here to support who and what we are. The Human Brain is worthless when the body is destroyed and the same with human life when devoid of the wildlife that we are destroying around us by disrespecting it. IMO",1368489600,28,843,4.275

5666309,5,B00BQI49VG,"I enjoyed this film so much that I have now seen it 3 times, I think. It has caused me to interact with my plants differently. I am learning to refrain from intervening in the outdoor garden so my healthy plants have an opportunity to call for help from beneficial insects.

I highly recommend this for plant lovers, science geeks, and gardeners.",1498608000,,346,4.580645161290323

5666312,5,B00BQI49VG,Great perspective builder regarding one of earth's main inhabitants... plants. It's leading me to want to know more about how different types of plants communicate with each other and how they survive their always-present predators. This movie is a good starting point and hopefully they'll make a series which goes into more detail.,1482278400,,333,5.30188679245283

5666315,5,B00BQI49VG,"PBS, Nat Geo, don't remember, but Attenborough-style documentary on scientific field work measuring pheromone production by plants, along with the circumstances that trigger it, its results, its variations, and its implications. If I were to say more you'd need a spoiler alert. It won't bore you: it has all the drama of Real Housewives of Field and Forest.",1465516800,,358,5.189655172413793

5666324,5,B00BQI49VG,"biochemistry has really stepped out of the box with these scientists.  things make so much sense and puts our closed minded ideals of human superiority to the curb.  miracles are only science that we are yet to understand, and they explain so much of seemingly miraculous plant behavior in this documentary.  really cool stuff.  i think i'll watch it again, if i have a chance before it goes off prime in June.",1463875200,,410,4.652777777777778
5666325,5,B00BQI49VG,"Nice documentary on the nature of plants.
What we don't see is right in front of us. Most people are unaware of their own internal body chi. Most people are unaware of the connection we should have between Mother Earth and Father (call him what you want) in the Universe. Both Mother and Father are nourished by love. Our love. Our love for others, for nature, for ourselves. Never close you minds and think you know it all. Once that happens we stop growing as a human race.",1463875200,,475,4.409090909090909
5666326,5,B00BQI49VG,"This is deep.  And this is new.  Despite a long career as a cultural ecologist in agricultural research, this is my first encounter with a vivid and convincing demonstration of how plants actually communicate and cooperate with diverse elements of their environment in order to survive and reproduce -- even to the extent of calling in help from predators of their predators.  Ah, the web of life!  Putting this together with other catch-up reading on advances in cellular signalling and genomic medicine, I am once again struck by the realization that Nature is indeed a vast self-organizing intelligence (some call it the Mind of God, others the Great Spirit).  I haven't been so awestruck since I read that life changing book on evolution when I was sixteen.  But it gets really exciting when I begin to relate these pieces of the puzzle to recent lessons from mind-body medicine and insights from my vipassana retreats.  When you make your eye single you gain access to a kind of x-ray vision that enables you to see deeply into all things. Movies like this bring so much into our purview.  Keep it coming, world!  I'm loving every minute of it!",1463529600,2,1149,4.791878172588833

5666328,5,B00BQI49VG,"...We Would Find Peace, I'm Sure.
After watching this video I wonder who is at the bottom of the ""food chain""; plants or, us, we humans.

I also sometimes wonder if they (the plants) are laughing at us because of our stupid ways.

Lastly, a mother's instruction, ""eat your vegetables"" should take on a new meaning after viewing this video.  And, a simple  ""thank you"" (to the plants) would be in good order as well.",1463011200,,415,4.493333333333333

5666330,5,B00BQI49VG,"""What Plants Talk About"":  I ordered this book because I was starting a small experimental garden for the youth in our religious org. I thought it would be fun to tell the kids 'what the plants were saying about their efforts'.  I was amazed when I began reading this book.  It is very informative and interesting.  If you have children especially for those raised in the city, you need to get this book. Begin your own little garden even if it just 3-5 pots of a mixture of seeds and a couple of tomato plants.  Let the kids help you mix the sand and potting soil, fill the pots and water them. Be sure to label what is in each pot and when you'll planted it. This is an interesting bonding and work efforts for you and your children.",1462233600,,735,4.258992805755396

Lets face it.. anything you put into you stomach that will keep you alive must have been alive itself.

This movie gives you a real understanding of how plants are alive even though they don't have sad eyes staring at you so you don't eat them.

I have no desire to kill anything but I refuse to ignore the reality that plants are alive so I can pretend to be a benevolent being that is not consumer of life.",1441929600,,656,4.190476190476191

this so.  To beleive in radom chance that these things evolved without a whole synergistic
coordination of what life is doing is insane.  I think several conclutions are invented and not science.
If there was such a thing as evolution that developes life going forward into time, then the high destuctive
tecnologies and genetic manipulations of man by machine is not part of sound evolution, nor is it
sound for creationest who should work with creation and not against it.  I do apprieciate the respect for
the plants to some degree however.",1426896000,,823,4.942028985507246

It presents the hypothesis that plants are actively responding to their environment, predators, competition, and even offspring. The documentary does an exceptional job at explaining this unbelievable phenomenon and the demonstrated scientific tests are beyond fascinating. As a casual gardener, I have to say that I'm not completely surprised by these findings because I've always suspected that plants are much more 'intelligent' than we give them credit for. I'm sure many botanists would agree.

The story of the wild tobacco plant that actually recruited less harmful pollinators by changing its blooming time of day is mind blowing.  As a gardener/organic grower it also gave me great insight into the basic good gardening practices my mother taught me and that I always follow on cultivation, soil conditioning and tender care with the roots of plants in transplanting.  It also makes explicit what is there to see in the documentary Microcosmos about the relationship between plants and pollinators as well as affirming what Lynn McTaggert's experiments showed about sentience & intention in plants in her books ""Living in the Field"" and ""the Intention Experiment"".

This important scientific research on plants and well done presentation not only prove that plants are more aware, smarter and conscious than before believed but that not much dissimilarity actually exists among flora, fauna and humans. In spite of the pomposity and destructiveness of some humans I am glad to see that many people are gradually reaching higher levels of knowledge, and even compassion and respect for other life forms of the planet.

They take too long to get the material to me,  6 - 8 weeks, whereas I can get it from here in just a few days, and have it read / viewed and shared with others before I even would have gotten it!

This DVD is wonderful! I learned a lot of this in college, in general terms, but this shows specifics, including time-lapse films of the plants in action. You see how they use chemicals to call other insect predators to eliminate the ones that are eating them, mushrooms that share with trees, benefitting both, plant parasites sniffing for the best plant to hook themselves into, plants calling for help and alerting other plants, to danger or good nutrients. You get to see the equivalent of a nervous system and movement away from danger or towards a good thing - just on an other than human timeline. It is just so very validating for me, as I learned this long ago, and many times folks seem to think a person is wacko when they tell others about these things - but here's the scientific proof presented in a way that's impossible to deny as well as entertaining, not preachy. My partner says people can get uncomfortable with the information partly because the stuff is actually scary when you think a little more deeply about it, and will never be able to look at a plant the same again, but like the accompanying book ( What a Plant Knows, by Daniel Chamovitz ), I just consider it testimony to the infinite diversity that is life even here on Earth, and am glad we are learning these things... and smile while I eat my cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato, thankful both to the creatures who give me nutrition, and that I have the perfect comeback to any vegetarians - since the plants as well as the animals are aware of what's going on.

5666495,5,B00BQI49VG,"Fascinating. Plants 'talk' to each other, and communicate in a variety of ways including releasing pollen when alarmed. Some plants are altruistic and some are predatory. They have a type of central nervousness system not so different than our own. They are conscious beings.  Darwin explored this issue as well. Old growth trees teach the young trees through spores in their roots how to protect themselves from insects and disease. When we log these giants we kill off generations of knowledge and eliminate the genetic diversity in forests. Everyone should watch this. Vegetarians and vegans won't like to hear this but plants show pain when they are 'killed.'
