I know that eliminating grain's in ones diet is necessary to be well and rid your body of problem's caused by eating the wrong food's.
Imagine, if people gave up grain's perhaps skin problems ,seizure's, ADHD  and some mental illness can be cured.  I know what gluten caused to my family member's.  All of the above. Unfortunately, celiac/gluten was not on the radar when my children were very young.
A simple test , by a qualified lab, can confirm celiac disease, or a high intolerance for gluten.",1492473600,2,672,4.7094017094017095

8688038,5,B00PHL9RDI,"So you wonder what's all the talk about The Grain Brain, and you think ""i don't have time to read this book!"", well---grab this DVD and have a thoroughly wonderful time because this is one kind, compassionate, REAL, humorous and smart as heck doctor who tells it like it is land  never loses you while you watch.  The time goes by in a nanosecond, it all makes sense, and the food he recommends is so yummy you won't believe it.  Best cookbook for multitude # of recipes that rock that I have ever seen, by the way.",1477612800,3,515,4.288659793814433
8688039,5,B00PHL9RDI,"I first saw this on PBS and just now saw it again a year later. It is just amazing. No wonder it was one of PBS's more frequent fund-drive shows. If you are concerned about Alzheimer's disease, or not becoming diabetic, or dealing with a kid who has ADHD, or maybe you just want to live healthily, this is some of the very best 90 minutes you could ever spend. Those diseases, especially ones of the brain, are basically preventable; a product of our modern-day diets. They are not a normal part of aging at all, and can be basically 100% prevented. His arguments, if you can call them that, rang so obvious and clear to me. They not only made perfect sense, but were well supported. Everyone should see this who has or loves someone who has a typical western diet and/or lifestyle. Diseases like Alzheimer's, something 50% of Americans will get over the age of 85, are completely preventable and unnecessary. A very liberating, beautiful amazing show.",1462924800,5,952,4.6390532544378695
