4504439,5,B004Z1HXZA,"What can I say, this is a world class singer with a world class band backing her up.

Sound, lighting and video quality are excellent.

Good mix of songs.

For me this video delivers and delivers and delivers.

I wish they would box it with a cd version of the songs so I could play them in the car.",1319414400,7,299,4.016949152542373
4504440,5,B004Z1HXZA,I hear Sheryl Crow songs for many years. She is an excellent musical performer. She plays fluently guitars and has a lovely voice. This dvd is perfectly for any age of people.,1318377600,,175,4.5
4504441,5,B004Z1HXZA,"Sheryl Crow and the band performed quite well in this Chicago concert and they get five stars for that.

But just to let you know, that this is a re-release of a previous blu-ray that you may already have.  Look carefully at the covers of both the newer release and the older release.  Both have the exact same image of Sheryl Crow and her guitar on the cover which is the clue to indicate that they both contain the exact same concert.

Pre-orders (I pre-ordered my now 2nd identical copy) may contain very little information on what the exact concert contains, so you may want to wait and check it out carefully before you order.",1313193600,10,631,4.460869565217391

4504443,5,B004Z1HXZA,An absolutely authentic concert! Talk about feeling like you are part of the band! On a scale from 0 - 10 this is a 15! Video and Audio well above what you can expect. Go Cheryl! You are now part of the family!!!,1440115200,,212,3.953488372093023

4504449,5,B004Z1HXZA,"really a great Blu-ray
just as expected.
specially sound and a great selection of songs as the best of her titles",1391299200,,113,4.428571428571429
4504450,4,B004Z1HXZA,I compare all of Sheryl's live performances to C'mon America 2003 which I replay on a regular basis simply because it's sooo good. IMHO this comes up well short of that. Different backing band from C'mon and just not on the same level  as the group she has there. Not sure what happened with the sound mix here but it's muddy at times. It's different material too. More funk less rock. Dang! (Fortunately she has a new band that is tremendous so stay tuned for more great stuff).,1390780800,,479,4.443181818181818

4504452,1,B004Z1HXZA,"I should've listened to others reviews on this one. Sheryl gives a very lack-luster performance here, making me believe she was forced into doing this performance. Also, I'm quite sure she is lip-synching which for me, is the greatest sin for a ""live"" performance. I also later purchased her Wildflower Tour: Live from New York, and am greatly satisfied with that one. My opinion, if you don't already have the Wilflower Tour, or any other by Sheryl Crow, buy that one instead of this one- Sheryl Crow: Live",1380585600,,507,4.7727272727272725
4504453,5,B004Z1HXZA,LOVE THIS ONE AND IT'S FUN TO WATCH  HOW THE CROWD REACTED TO HER SINGING THE SONGS SHE ALSO HAD FUN WHILE SHE WAS ON STAGE I WOULD RECOMEND THIS ONE IF YOU LOVE WATCHING CHERYL CROW,1378944000,,182,3.918918918918919
4504454,5,B004Z1HXZA,"well recorded with execlent clarity and tone.
It was definitely value for money
any of Sheryl Crows other DVD'S  as she is a world class performer.",1361923200,2,147,4.653846153846154
4504455,5,B004Z1HXZA,"Seriously, I've enjoyed it many many times over and I doubt that will ever change.  Every aspect of it are in the top notch realm.  First of all the music...it is about the music and it doesn't disappoint.  The percussion is extraordinarily fine and exciting.  Its a major standout and its good enough to be a standout among any music video.  Its a terrible shame that the drummer got dumped eventually when Sheryl changed her style but this review is about how great Sheryl Crow Live is and it certainly is.  I'm somewhat surprised at how very decent her guitar playing is.  I especially enjoyed when she laid down nice bass lines.  I'm pretty sure shes a fan of the basic beat, including drums and bass guitar, and it really shows here.  The lead guitar by Peter Stroud is also very fine and dandy...jokes aside, this guy can play, is a real standout, and nearly steals the show on more than one occasion.  He's played with her a lot and the synergy is great.  He embellishes her sweet voice in a unique and tasteful way.  He also never overdoes it and doesn't get in the way of her being the front woman and star of the show.  That she is.  Every song from start to finish is well done to the point of wow, I want to hear that again.  I've had listening sessions when I played this video over and over for hours.  Originally I had the HD version and eventually I had to get the bluray.  its too good to miss anything from less than the best production and the bluray doesn't disappoint.  The back up vocals are excellent as well as the back up guitar playing and keyboards.  Finally, last and certainly not least, Sheryl is gorgeous and every move is a delight.  I fell in love with her over and over as best as a guy can far from the real experience.  I mean not in a creepy way, just that she is so compelling and beautifully feminine in her presentation and place in the spotlight that she so surely deserves.  If you are a Sheryl fan this is the one to get.  A total winner and don't let anyone tell you differently.",1361059200,,2023,4.3076923076923075
4504456,5,B004Z1HXZA,I was not a Sheryl Crow fan when I bought this dvd but I sure am one now. Wonderful variety of songs performed superbly. Great stage presence and excellent backing group.,1359849600,,170,4.516129032258065
4504457,4,B004Z1HXZA,"My family loves this performer and enjoyed seeing and hearing with such quality! We really enjoyed. Soon acquire another blu ray disc.
Thanks!",1357776000,,142,5.217391304347826
4504458,4,B004Z1HXZA,"Sheryl Crow is captivating as ever. Visually, this is a great DVD for seeing her perform. But the sound is flat.

I bought this DVD after renting it from Netflix and the rented version sounds much better through my stereo only system, it has more sparkle and has more ""air"" around the instruments and vocals. The DVD I purchased from Amazon sounds compressed. It appears this version dated 2011 has Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS. The rented version dated 2004 has Dolby Stereo 2.0 and 2.1.

Don't let it put you off buying this DVD, it is a good concert, but I am going to try and find the 2004 version from somewhere.",1343952000,,614,4.424778761061947
4504459,5,B004Z1HXZA,"this is an awesome dvd. i knew that before i got it. i love live shows , dvd or cd. i've recently turned into a sheryl crow freak. so i knew it was a win/win for me. i was not disappointed. as usual , sheryl rocks !!",1329091200,,216,3.617021276595745
4504460,2,B004Z1HXZA,"I really like Sheryl Crow songs but this blu-ray is missing many things that a great concert dvd should have:

The main artist doesn't seem to have fun at first when she comes to the stage..
No real audience or fan, instead some ''paid'' people to half fill a room to act and dance like morons..
Camera never catch the audience or show the back of the room...empty room
No emotions..not a single great moment...just a ''Recorging''

sound quality is ok
Picture is ok.

So that's not a great DVD, if someone knows a REAL dvd or Sheryl crow on show please leave me a message.

Thanks",1327795200,2,581,4.401869158878505
4504461,5,B004Z1HXZA,"Many others have already reviewed this video. I downloaded it into my prime account. The not having the DVD package to actually tangibly ""have"" is a little different, but I can watch this anywhere I can log into a CPU with internet. Being a Sheryl Crow fan, this is really great. And, when I have family or friends over for a dinner event I can put this on in the background for light entertainment since not everyone shares my eclectic musical taste. But most people like, or at least now of Sheryl Crow. As a side note, I bought this specifically for the version of ""Home"" that I can't seem to find anywhere else, but absolutely love.",1325721600,,636,4.444444444444445

The band and the audience are so into it... the energy is pulsing from the band to the audience.

Super sound quality, camera work, and mixing. Top notch show!!",1517702400,,405,4.690140845070423
