8489607,5,B005ZEEVS8,"Very touching and heartfelt documentary. You can tell the feelings shown by the survivors are genuine. Even if you're a cold-hearted person, I don't think you can watch this without getting teary-eyed. There's no better way to comprehend the tragedy that happened than to hear directly from the people who were involved.  There is a heavy Christian theme throughout much of the video as many of the people who spoke were/are religious, but as an atheist that did not affect my opinion of the video. Regardless of one's religious beliefs, it's always a horrible tragedy when so many people lose their lives needlessly, especially when they are children.",1503014400,,652,5.037037037037037
