2406720,1,B000B8384G,I've seen this with my sister a few times and I cannot believe anything so insipid and demoralizing can be shown on television.  This show stinks!!,1127174400,3,147,4.653846153846154
2406721,5,B000B8384G,"This show is the BEST sitcom on television right now!!!!! This show has great chemistry between the actors, they all seem like they really enjoy doing the show(not like a lot of other shows where you can tell the actors are just doing the show for the money). This show is just plain FUN to watch. I can not wait until all seasons are released on DVD. REBA is just one great show. I just read on a web-site that SEASON 3 is scheduled to be released APRIL 25 2006, cant wait!!!!!!!!!!",1127174400,14,483,4.260869565217392
2406722,1,B000B8384G,Reba McEntire has a program that robs the heart of its dignity.  This show is one of the reasons that television is such a wasteland of immorality today.  Will I be buying this??  Nope!!!,1126915200,3,187,4.4411764705882355
2406723,5,B000B8384G,"I don't know what the two reviewer's who gave the show a bad review are watching but it definitely ain't ""Reba""!  Reba is a hilarious family comedy.  Not only is Reba McEntire a great comedic actress but the rest of the cast, particularly Mellisa Peterman as ""Barbra Jean"" are wonderful as well.  Give ""Reba"" a chance and I guarantee you will not be dissapointed.",1126915200,19,363,4.640625
2406724,1,B000B8384G,"This sitcom is the ""cheesiest"" thing on television.  Reba McEntire needs to quit while she's ahead.  I bought the first season with high expectations and was disappointed.  Therefore, I don't think I can expect better in the second season.  I am one person who will not be buying this DVD collection.  Once was enough for me!",1126569600,4,325,4.732142857142857
2406725,1,B000B8384G,"This program has very little redeeming qualities.  The main problem is that it glorifies dysfunctionalism in a way that makes it appear o.k.  McEntire is a good traditional country singer but a complete failure in the acting department, overacting and performing over the top which make the other actors who appear with her try too hard.  That being said, the first season was terrible and things have NOT improved with each succeeding season.",1126569600,4,443,5.041095890410959

2406801,5,B000B8384G,"I finally picked up Season 2 after seeing Season 1 in a Walmart several years ago and nearly falling on the floor with laughter. About the show itself, it is very reminiscent of many families today, in that they are not the Leave it Beaver ideal. Now Reba combines two-three different scenarios together in one crazy scenario, but the point still stands. In this season, we get Van and Cheyenne dealing with the new baby, Reba dealing with the Brock and Barbara Jean dynamic in new and hilarious ways and a  split of sorts between Reba and her headstrong teenager Kyra.

I think what sets this comedy apart from many of the comedies that exist nowadays is that it has a heart and isn't just a half hour mash of innuendo. As a fan, you find yourself rooting for this characters and hoping that everything is going to be okay at the end of the day. This extends to a character like Barbara Jean, who is not immediately a likeable character because of Brock and Reba's marriage. The fact that any of this remotely works is the product of smart writing and good character development. Highest recommendation.",1445126400,,1104,4.598984771573604

2406903,5,B000B8384G,"Reba is a very cute comedy based on the perils of Reba Hart, a mother of three in the throes of a divorce from her ex-husband, Brock, who is a dentist involved with quite a ditzy, but sometimes endearing hygenist. As if the divorce was not enough to handle, Reba must also endure the issues that come with her eldest daughter who is pregnant and still in high school. While the situation would have most fall to their knees, Reba seems to be able to manage and make things work better than most. Barbara Jean, however, can make life very difficult and I am amazed at Reba's composure when dealing with this very absurd character. Season 1 is full of laughs along with Season 2. However, as the series progresses, it becomes less entertaining and more annoying due to the choices made and the children who seem to get left in the background as Cheyenne is always front and center and the one who seems to get all the attention from Reba.",1376611200,,936,4.4476744186046515

They get into all sorts of crazy situations, usually involving family fights, but sometimes wandering into the truly bizarre (they even managed a tasteful comedy about Hurricane Katrina). The dialogue is witty, the actors have perfect timing, and the plots are entertaining. Barbara-Jean, steals most of the shows, but all of the characters have their moments.

Great prouduct and I reccomend this to EVERYONE!",1265414400,,411,4.08641975308642
2406963,5,B000B8384G,"Season two picks up pretty much where season one left off.  Reba Hart (Reba Mcentire) is finding life raising her kids alone to be very hard.  There's the question of whether Brock (Christopher Rich) and his new wife Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman) are giving youngest son Jake (Mitch Holleman) junk food.  Middle daughter Kyra (Scarletta Pomers) is entering those awkward teenage years, and becomes upset when Reba tries to date her new boyfriend's father.  And new teenage parents Cheyenne and Van (Joanna Garcia and Steve Howey) are dealing with college life and a new born.

Reba finally has to face reality that she needs to get a job.  She even tries working for Brock before going to work for his arch rival (across the hall).  Van decides to buy Cheyenne a real ring.  And he gives up football for a year.  And Reba just tries to balance everyone in her life, including Barbra Jean who keeps attempting to worm her way into the new family dynamic.

I must admit, this season has two episodes back to back I really don't love.  We get a little too much information on Reba's potential new love life in ""Ring-a-Ding.""  And ""Cookies for Santa"" has to be the saddest Christmas episode ever.

On the other hand, it has some of the funniest moments in the series.  ""A Moment in Time"" features a video for Cheyenne and Van's daughter that doesn't go at all like anyone expected it to.  And ""Seeing Red"" provides wonderful laughs when Barbra Jean comes back from a makeover looking just like Reba.

This season also really allowed the characters to grow into their own.  While there are plenty of laughs, the writers worked hard to flesh things out and make them into real people.

While some serious stuff comes up, this show is still very funny.  You can't help but laugh as you enjoy the antics of the Hart family.",1251158400,,1816,4.61875

2406988,5,B000B8384G,"Reba McEntire stars as Reba Hart, a mother of three whose husband Brock (Christopher Rich) has recently left her for his pregnant dental assistant. Meanwhile, another blow struck as Reba discovered her 17-year-old daughter Cheyanne was also expecting.

Now, the second year focuses upon teenage parents Cheyanne (Joanna Garcia) and Van (Steve Howey), who live in Reba's house with their baby daughter Elizabeth. The two are truly unequipped for the real world, and constantly come up against blows from the workforce and college.

There's also little Henry, the son of Brock and Barbra Jean. While Reba would love to forget the very existence of the baby -- as well as his clueless, ditzy mother -- for some inane reason Barbra Jean is determined to become her new best friend.

Meanwhile, Reba's youngest, Jake, is only eight; and smart, sarcastic middle child Kyra (Scarlett Pomers) acts out from the pressures of being the only sane person around.

What's a woman to do? Most in Reba's situation would fall apart, but not her. Even when things are at their darkest, Reba's wit allows her to laugh and see the good -- though in no way is her character, or the show, sappy or sentimental. Rather, the imperfect Hart family strives to live each day to the fullest, making the best of each day however they can.

Particularly memorable Season 2 episodes include ""A Moment in Time,"" where various family members end up quarreling over the things they reveal in a video they're making for baby Elizabeth; as well as Reba's first forays into dating; a more introspective look at Van's upbringing; and Kyra's increasing unhappiness with living in her mother's house.

Description:

Reba Hart (Reba McEntire) knew divorce wasn't going to be easy - she just hadn't anticipated how much her ex-husband's new wife would want to be part of ""the family."" On top of that, Reba learns that her married daughter isn't going to be moving out of the house with her new husband and baby daughter as planned. Now, with no breadwinner in the house, Reba realizes she'd rather accept a job working for her ex-husband than apply for food stamps. But no mater how hard she tries to make family life run smoothly, Reba soon realizes there's just no darn way to please everyone!",1181088000,,674,4.608333333333333

It would also make a difference if the show were a little more consistent but it is not.  One minute she's complaining about her daughter (Cheyenne) and her lifestyle or her ex-husband's new wife....then the next she's out contradicting everything she just complained about.

I bought this DVD set (there are no problems) because I read the ""rave reviews"" that her fans obviously give her because they love her unconditionally.  But just because you love someone unconditionally doesn't mean that you ""like"" everything they do.  I can't put my finger on it, but there is something about this program that is disturbing and misguided.  Perhaps I think Reba should stop playing ""actress"" and get back to what she does best...singing....or perhaps its the inconsist production values of the program itself.  Some of the scripts have potential here but they are executed in a very, very lame fashion.  Folks call that ""cheesy"" today.  Sometimes episodes are aimed at manipulating the audience emotions.  I'm all for this IF it is done in a way that is logical to the episode's premise.  But Reba fails miserably in this department.  The acting is overplayed...mostly because Reba herself tends to overdo it which means that those who play off of her have to do the same so everything comes out forced and hammy.  Or perhaps I find the entire series artificial, contrived and phony.  I tried, but I just didn't like it.  I'm sorry.",1139616000,3,1276,4.740909090909091

Why can't we have a television program that depicts this?  A modern one, I mean.  Not reruns of ""Leave it to Beaver"".  ""Reba"" is an example of 'bad television', bad influence...bad everything.

This show is full of dim-witted characters...B.J., Cheyenne, Van and Brock.  These characters are way too unrealistic.

Pretty far-fetched and unrealistic.  I'll take my ex-husbands new wife with a grain of salt...as a matter of fact...I'll even be friends with her....then I'll buy food stamps instead of suing my ex for money!!

This is just my opinion but for some reason this redheaded, overrated, obnoxious singer named McEntire thinks she can act (she cannot act her way out of a paper bag).  The first season was made palatable only by her supporting cast.  The second season (this one) features a new opening and control freak McEntire using all of her amateurish acting techniques to mug and overract her way all over the place making the others in the cast look bad.  Its a show that has gotten progressively worse as the seasons have progressed.  I can't believe I allowed myself to be talked into buying this rehashed ""ROSANNE"".

It has become worse with each succeeding season.  Now I must say that I must be the only one who liked Park Overall as Reba's best friend.  But she's gone in this season.  Bad mistake.  If that's not enough it is obvious the writers changed because the continuity is not there.  In the first season Reba was a substitute teacher at Cheyenne's school which had her sparring with Julia Duffy which was made only palatable by DUffy's character (because Reba cannot act...sorry).  In this season it seems Reba has no work experience so she has to go to work for her ex-hubby Brock and B.J. because she needs the money???  This is totally ridiculous.  (Bad writing).  Let me get this straight...no longer does she have her teaching certificate, but her ex is still not paying child support although Reba has custody of his two children (who are minors) and who she allows visitation rights.  His excuse is that he has no money to give her because of the new baby (who is never seen???).  If Reba and the writers were going to do this show justice they would have her take him to court...not go to work for him...hello???  I know this was all used as a plot to get her to work at the dental office but there are more believable and comical ways to bring this about.  The way it is in this second season is an even bigger insult to the intelligence of the viewer than the first season was ....those viewers who remember Reba teaching and who know that any man with minor children is responsible for them by law.  This show is a mess and McEntire is so overrated as an actress.  I read somewhere that someone thought she had been separated at birth from Bert Lahr, the Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz since they both have the same face and they overpower with their constant muggings and performance exaggerations.  I totally agree.  Reba looks like Bert Lahr!  (Maybe she's distantly related to him in some way or she's watches ""The Wizard of Oz"" every day to get acting influence from him).",1130803200,8,2159,4.442748091603053

Last season ended with the birth of Reba's first grandchild. But she doesn't have time to relax, with Cheyenne and Van going off to college, only to have Van injure his knee and postpone school. So the new parents will be living with Grandma Reba awhile longer -- whether she likes it or not.

Things get even more complex when Reba finds that she must get a job, for the first time in several years -- especially when she ends up working for her ex-husband's hated rival. And her old pal Lori Ann convinces her to try ""speed dating,"" which leads to a rather deceptive date with a nice guy. Problem is, she can't manage to say ""I love you.""

And those are only a few of her problems: attractions to her daughter's boyfriend's dad, lonely Christmas Eves, private videotapes, Barbara Jean's maternal yearnings, an ex-boyfriend's death, self-defense courses, jealousy over the expensive gifts Van's parents are lavishing on baby Elizabeth... and whether Kyra will leave home to live with Brock.

Perhaps no sitcom on TV embodies the fragmented extended family better than ""Reba"" -- ex-husband, new wife and her baby, ex-wife and her kids, ex-wife's daughter and her new husband and baby. And in the second season, ""Reba"" settles into a comfortable niche that builds on what we already have seen. High school is over, babies are born, couples are married. Let the chaos begin.

There are some unrealistic twists. After treating Reba and Cheyenne like dirt, the cold-hearted, hard-drinking Montgomery Sr. suddenly goes all goopy over his grandchild and turns up at Reba's house to fawn over her? Nuh-uh. And the whole subplot about Reba's boyfriend never really goes anywhere, and fortunately ends quickly.

Fortunately, most of them are all too real, such as Reba's anguish over her kids seeming to prefer Brock and Barbara Jean's more stable household. It's fun to see them all beating each other up at a self-defense course, insulting each other on a ""time capsule"" video, and dealing with weepy boyfriends. And the twisted family situations reach a peak with the rivalry between Brock and Barbara Jean's ex-boyfriend.

Reba McIntyre continues the ""manic wise woman"" role that she had in the first season, but polishes the edges this time.  Melissa Peterman also gets even better, with a less pushy but still crazy Barbara Jean (who no longer talks about Jesus in every sentence). And fans of ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" will want to keep an eye out for James  Avery, playing (what else?) a sarcastic judge. ""Uncle Phil"" is the icing on the cake for one of the season's best episodes.

Post-divorce dating, new parenthood, teen romance and workplace rivalry rule in the second season of ""Reba."" It's weaker than the first season in places, but still enormous fun.",1129248000,35,3045,4.9412915851272015

2407168,1,B000B8384G,"I don't know what people see in an arrogant redhead who thinks she can do no wrong.  This woman is so full of herself that what she takes into a situation comedy as performing is so over the top that it leaves one disgusted and angry.  This is not the provocation we need today.  We need inspiration and edification...not someone who wants to promote herself and in doing so, compromises everything and everyone around her as she does in this lame attempt at comedy.  Zero stars!!!",1127952000,,481,4.558139534883721

She plays the mother of 4 and in her downhome way manages to carry the family through some tuff times.  It's a show that deals with real life issues but in a comedic way...the producers of ""Reba"" know what they are doing with this show! 5 EAGER STARS!",1127865600,11,335,4.317460317460317
2407170,1,B000B8384G,"There was and only will be one classic redhead associated with physical comedy and it is not Reba McEntire.  Those who buy into this piece of fluff about dysfunctionalism are the same ones who glorify the immoral lifestyle that is plaguing our country today.  We need more ""perfect family"" sitcoms out there that can help encourage us to live the way God meant us to and to strive for perfection.  This program only encourages us to do the opposite.  McEntire overacts so bad in every episode...but then she MUST always be NUMBER ONE.  Lucille Ball is probably turning over in her grave when she hears people compare Reba to her.  That in itself is a disgrace and an insult!!  If you like the program fine but please...Reba is NOT nor ever will be another Lucille Ball.",1127865600,3,769,4.610294117647059

It's no wonder she garnered a GOLDEN GLOBE nomination for her work on the series! I promise you won't be disappointed!,1127779200,11,285,4.39622641509434
2407175,5,B000B8384G,"With all the frivolous reality television shows, and gory crime scene dramas there is something very heartening about this classic televisions show. It reminds me of Roseanne  ability to portray something akin to real life with a humorous wit. No there are no 20 something's who never work and hang out at a coffee shop all day, nor will you find the perfect sitcom family of yesteryear. That the show can remain humorous and witty when dealing with such topics as divorce, teen pregnancy and alcoholism is a tribute to great writers and the down home charm of its star Mrs. McEntire. Furthermore, the assemble cast brought together by its dynamic leader shows true chemistry and play off one another's strengths nicely. The sardonic Mrs. McEntire is a perfect match in the overtly sugary Melissa Peterman character. I enjoy this show immensely for its classic good charm and question those who could expect more from a comedic sitcom. This is not a tribute to the perfect life but a vision of what one might find in real life.",1127779200,10,1027,4.769662921348314
2407176,1,B000B8384G,"Duplicity at its worst and it sets a bad example.  Not everyone wants to watch a program about making the best out of bad situations.  To me, this program isn't about that..its about glorifying dysfunctionalism.",1127692800,,211,5.0
2407177,5,B000B8384G,"I don't know how they did it, but Season 2 of Reba is even better than the original!  Reba McEntire is so amazing in the title role and this year takes the helm as Executive Producer!  The characters continue to develop perfectly and with the help of two news ""little ones"" the situational comedy is TOP NOTCH!

If you loved season 1 then you'll absolutely adore season 2! If you've never seen the show, Season 2 is a GREAT place to start!

On a side note, this show is very important in today's society.  'Reba' shows a different side of the American family. It shows the blended family and sets an example of how you can make the best of bad situations.",1127606400,15,655,4.336065573770492
