4392430,5,B004K4FUP2,"Although I am probably too old for cartoons (I grew up watching Scooby Doo, Yogi Bear, Flintstones, Jetsons, Bugs Bunny, etc.) I still love my old time favorites and I also really like a few newer toons and I LOVE Ben 10, from the original series to the new Ben 10 Ultimate Alien. I recommend all the DVD's except Ben 10 Alien Force #7 - #7 has the episodes immediately after Ben and the gang of plumbers kids save the universe by defeating the Highbreed. I thought the show had went to the trash bin, that the writers, directors, and producers had all went insane. After watching 4 or 5 episodes I quit watching new episodes. Big mistake.

I missed 7 or 8 episodes and when I caught a few of them as reruns I immediately bought Ben 10 Alien Force #8 and all after that. I was thrilled that the Ben 10 I loved so much was back. I recommend for all...from kids to old folks who are kids at heart.",1312243200,4,895,4.203488372093023
8432258,1,B004K4FUP2,"When I opened it, the wrapping was already loose, unlike normal brand new dvds. The discs have scratches and streaks, as well as a puddle of coffee stain-like marking on the back instead of the normal clean mirror look. I'll be getting a refund and sending it back.",1524528000,,265,4.541666666666667
