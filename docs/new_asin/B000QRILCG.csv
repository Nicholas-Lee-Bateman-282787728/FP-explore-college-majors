8197011,4,B000QRILCG,"This DVD contains a second film (1972) made of the superb historical play by Millard Lampell.  (The first was in 1965, starring Trevor Howard, no less.  This version stars 2 blockbuster stars, Alec Guinness and Ralph Richardson.  The plot concerns Napoleon I's last years on St. Helena under the care of the last British Governor, Sir Hudson Lowe.

Of course, this film won't appeal to the average viewer.  No explosions, for one thing.  Historical context that doesn't involve lots of people killing each other.  No women with more breast than taste.  An actually intelligent script (horrors!).

The good news is that you don't have to buy it as a separate DVD.  This same film is included as an extra on the DVD of ""The Best of Friends"", starring Guinness again, plus no less than Wendy Hiller and Patrick McGoohan.  This is essentially a 3-person show about the friendship and correspondence of George Bernard Shaw with of his contemporaries.  The DVD totals about 4-1/2 hours of top-quality performance.",1210118400,18,1007,4.9640718562874255
