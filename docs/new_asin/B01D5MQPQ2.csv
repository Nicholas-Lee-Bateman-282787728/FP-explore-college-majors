7697807,4,B01D5MQPQ2,"I love the series, and they came up with this movie to continue with some loose ends on the story. I personally think it went a little far away from the main story, but it still was fun to watch. If you are a Psycho-Pass fan you will enjoy the movie. If you haven't you need to watch the series first. I wouldn't call this a movie, but more like a Season 2.1.2...",1468281600,,363,3.9863013698630136

7697810,4,B01D5MQPQ2,"I'm  a huge fan of Psycho Pass season 1, I thought it was a masterpiece, but I didn't really dig season 2.
This movie is pretty satisfying for me as a fan. It's great to see the MWPSB back in action and this time they seems way more badass than in the tv series. My complain on this movie is there's too much focus on Akane, and not enough screen time for Kogami and Ginoza.
I didn't give it 5 stars because of half the movie in it's original japanese audio was spoken in english, which made it sound very bad. The 'english' dialog was written by a japanese writer, and spoken by japanese voice actor. They just sound very awkward and unnatural.

But overall, I'm just happy to finally able to see more of the Sybil system and the MWPSB, watching this movie lower my crime coefficient :-)",1466380800,8,788,4.281879194630872

7697812,5,B01D5MQPQ2,"This series has earned it's right to get 5 stars.  If you want to know more about it you got to start from season 1- 2.  The movie is like the cherry topping for this movie.  It has a fantastic plot that makes a lot of sense.  I would recommend you to watch it in English sub it explains the story much more better but, the English dub it's self is not bad either.  The movie has been on my most watch list and let me tell ya it does not disappoint it exceeds my expectations.",1465430400,,476,3.9166666666666665
7697813,4,B01D5MQPQ2,"It typically is a pleasant thing, when an anime series receives a movie, and a good way of including important plot details that are necessary for the story's progression, but not worth dwelling upon throughout an entire series. That is what the Psycho-Pass Movie focuses on; the effect of the Sybil system, or at least its political implications, in foreign countries. It is interesting to see how rest of the world is faring compared with Japan, and most of the film is, in fact, concerned with politics and Akane's role in unraveling the many mysteries behind the question, ""Is the Sybil System truly good for humanity?"" Each release of this series is focused on breaking down the unethical and corrupt parts of said system, and this movie is, again, another cog in the machine. Of course, without spoiling anything, it was also a way to wrap up what was essentially an open character thread with Shinya. Nevertheless, this is mostly Akane's movie, and her observations of war and ""democracy"" in a world she is unfamiliar with. If you are familiar with the series, then you are familiar with the techno-noir music and glossy animation; everything is consistently beautiful and dark. Even so, understand that this is a story-driven film. New characters are introduced, but it is all for the sake of the plot and representing a falsehood or flaw in the Sybil System. Rumor has reached my ear that we are coming close to the conclusion of the Sybil System's reign of injustice, and so this was a necessary and impactful stop along the way. That said, the film truly is engaging when focused on expounding upon such flaws, but sometimes the pacing can lag a bit, especially in the beginning of the second act. One thing I will say is that Akane seems to be losing her humanity, and every new release is taking her further and further from the character she once was. This character progression is splendid, and one of the main reasons I enjoy this show so much. Granted, the action is very good, but not so much individual fighting as mass war-based combat. So, there are your three focus points: Akane, the story, and the message. If those three aspects appeal to you, and you have seen the first and second seasons, then this is a good buy. Especially with the new addition of UV disc to the pack. This is a revelation, as I don't think anime films have done so before, so maybe this is the start of a new thing! Take my word as you see fit.",1459641600,8,2442,4.6160919540229886
7697814,5,B01D5MQPQ2,"The long-awaited film installment of the much-loved series, Psycho-Pass: The Movie is the an action-packed thrill ride that tackles new moral dilemmas, shows Sybil in a new light and reunites one of anime's greatest partnerships.

The basic premise: Taking place 3 years after the events of Season 1, Sybil is now expanding to other parts of the world. A terrorist attack ensues, leading Akane to travel to a foreign nation to investigate.

Beyond that, this review will refrain from spoilers, instead offering some quick notes on why this film is must-own.

1) It's Psycho-Pass. Some people love to hate on Season 2, but the fact is that this franchise has yet to disappoint. It's consistently one of the most thought-provoking, coolest series of this past decade, and this film only improves on that.
2) If you didn't like Season 2, that's fine - it doesn't really affect this film a whole lot. This is essentially the ""true"" sequel to Season 1, which makes sense, since Season 1's writer and creator (the fantastic Gen Urobuchi) returns to pen this story.
3) Sybil is shown to actually be more than just a dystopian dictator - for the first time, we actually get to see the GOOD that it does. Season 1 and 2 were great at showing how ruthless and cold the system is, but now we finally see what the rest of the world is like outside of Tokyo in the year 2116,  and it's not pretty.
4) The cast of characters is great. Ginoza is a scene-stealer, and Jouji Saiga is downright incredible as usual. Akane continues to mature and become the ultimate inspector, and two returning characters remind of us why Psycho-Pass Season 1 is considered a masterpiece. New characters are also fun and a breath of fresh air for the series, offering new types of enemies as well as nods to previous cyber-punk anime.
5) Last but not least, it's visually stunning. The series was always great looking (original episode 18 notwithstanding), but the film's budget certainly helped take things to the next level. Vibrant colors, detailed architecture and well-blended CGI make this truly feel like the next level of Psycho-Pass. Add to that the always impressive soundtrack, and you have an audio/visual feast for the eyes and ears.

I can't attest to the bonus features, but I can say with certainty that after seeing this in theaters, I have been counting down the days until it's home release, and I can NOT wait for June 7 to get here.",1459468800,13,2419,4.722748815165877

This movie takes place right after the events of Season two. You are dropped in quickly and are taken for a ride that, while it has it moments of pure luck that is contrary to the series it self, still entertain fans of the series.

Personally, I enjoyed this more then the entirety of Season 2. It just felt more natural and not as forced.
