8097293,5,B000CCBCFI,"Excellent job in Leap of Faith. When a con man is given a real lesson, the impact is incredible.
What he does with the information is even better - changes him and the lives of others.

Planes, Trains, & Automobiles is one of those examples of what happens when you start to help some people.
It goes from moment to moment and situations result from the prior actions.",1396051200,,368,4.411764705882353

8097297,4,B000CCBCFI,"Yes, This LEAP OF FAITH was a big surprise. It is NOT a comedy. I am a Steve Martin fan and assumed it was another comedy. It is not. But it is a very good drama. All three were quite good, LEAP OF FAITH is the best in my opinion. It will surprise you.  ...Oscar",1332892800,2,262,3.7636363636363637
