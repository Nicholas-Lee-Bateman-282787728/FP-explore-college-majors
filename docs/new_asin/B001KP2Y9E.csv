3667309,5,B001KP2Y9E,"I am a Harlequin fan. ""At The Midnight Hour"" did not disapoint. It has everything from intrigue to a true love story.
Throw a child into the mix and you have a movie for most all ages. The casting was right on.",1395273600,2,210,4.023809523809524

8315646,5,B001KP2Y9E,"I had something to do which required there be no subtitles. I didn't expect much. The rip-off of The Nanny and the Professor was evident almost immediately. The Little Prince, with two princes, became more clear. Add a bit of Agatha Christie, and boom!  -- More than a puff piece, to a discerning reader and film buff.",1503446400,2,318,4.578947368421052
8315647,5,B001KP2Y9E,"First of all, Simon MacCorkindale has been eye candy in my book for many years.  May he RIP.  I have not seen any Harlequin movies before but after this one, I may watch all of them!  The actor who played Andy, the little boy, was delightful as was the one that played Liz.  Loved the plot with a storyline of a ""who done it"" mixed with a loved story ...and of course the setting was beautiful with the house, horses and the old car.  Loved it!",1503187200,3,444,4.116279069767442
