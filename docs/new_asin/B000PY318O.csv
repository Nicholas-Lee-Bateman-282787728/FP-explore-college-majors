 Passing along the info. TY",1424649600,,98,3.9
8193700,5,B000PY318O,"This is an oldie but a goodie!  The information in this DVD clearly outlines the psychology of your common criminal. I wish I would have found this many years ago.  As Marc Mac Young clearly states, when a criminal interviews you, YOU WANT TO FAIL THAT INTERVIEW.",1400112000,,263,4.574468085106383
8193701,2,B000PY318O,"The website is MUCH more informative than this video, which looks like it got codec'd over from the original VHS tape. Good info but much better presented on the website, which you should go to: nononsenseselfdefense.com",1370563200,,220,5.138888888888889

several typical scenarios are getting analyzed over and over again, every time from a different perspective",1348531200,,230,5.794117647058823
8193703,4,B000PY318O,"Marc and the team put together a good educational video regarding personal safety on the street. I think that this video is good for all adults to view and possibly teenaged youth. I recommend it especially for persons leaving home to venture into new cities, like college students or persons heading away from home to live in the city.

I would like to see more on reading the body language of possible criminals. However, the video does teach about awareness and some of the things to look for. The explanation of the steps leading up to an assault and how fast things happen are the most valuable.",1342051200,,600,4.607476635514018
8193704,5,B000PY318O,"This DVD holds your attention; it is professionally presented and interesting, and is aimed at both men and women.

Victims are not chosen at random. One can therefore prevent a planned attack from escalating to physical violence by gaining an understanding of the stages the criminal goes through in order to reach his objective. Before attacking, the criminal must ensure himself that he can get away with the attack. The analogy of viewing criminals as part of a food chain--criminals are predictable; they are both predators and prey who must choose the ""right"" victim--was particularly effective for demonstrating the importance of understanding the criminal mindset.

While the criminal uses the tools of surprise, fear, and a willingness to commit physical violence, he is not looking for a fight where he might get hurt. Learning a number of martial arts techniques may therefore not help you. To thwart an attack, view yourself as being on equal footing with the criminal. You don't have to be bigger or meaner than he is, only seem big enough or mean enough to send the signal that it is unsafe for him to attack you. The DVD did a great job demonstrating how to use appropriate body language to avoid becoming a victim.

Perhaps the most important concepts that this DVD teaches are: Detect the warning signals of an impending attack; a person who is willing to defend him or herself and his boundaries will almost always be passed over by a criminal; and learn the value of the phrase, ""Give me five feet!""",1238198400,4,1518,4.853281853281853
