The story line was good and probably is exactly what may be going on today with experimental cloning.  Jurassic Park is a far better watch by far for this type.  Being a Dean Cain fan, I like it.

1823763,4,B000083C60,"I really love this movie.

Is it because I wasn't expecting too much?  Maybe.  But I've watched it now several more times and it really holds up under repeated viewings.

Dean Caine trades in his superhero spandex & cape for a helicopter playing the new head of security for a super secret underground lab.  Using powers of deduction which would make the Man of Steel kryptonite green with envy, Caine soon realizes he's guarding a lab full of genetic engineers attempting to revive & reconstruct those high flying, fire breathing creatures of legend - dragons.

The cast is full of fun B movie type actors who infuse the required fun & fright factor into an equally solid script.  This isn't Dragonslayer, nor is it Dragonheart or even Reign of Fire - this is Sci-Fi Channel produced low budget fare, but it delivers a lot of bang for the buck.  The director goes a little overboard with his stylish split screen action at times, however it's never really annoying.

So then let's see.  Terri Hatcher, former girlfriend of Superman Dean Caine is fighting female dragons over on Desperate Housewives and Dean Caine is fighting ""real"" lab produced dragons in this flick.  Looks like their careers are paralleling each other's nicely, wouldn't you say?",1155254400,,1250,4.849056603773585
1823764,1,B000083C60,"Some scientists in an underground lab are experimenting with DNA and create a dragon which gets loose and stalks them around the facility.  The setting is appropriately claustrophobic and the sets are done quite well.  The CGI dragon looks passable, not great but believable enough I guess.  The characters are all pretty good - EXCEPT Dean Cain.  He's the security guard, and he's a pompous, self-righteous prick.  His knowledge of childhood fairy tales makes him more knowledgeable about dragons than all the scientists put together.  He single handedly makes this movie absolutely unwatchable.  That's too bad because without him, I think this might have been pretty good.  Well, if not for the fact that the idiot director has a fetish for that split screen effect where they show four different scenes running simultaneously in the four different quadrants of the screen.  Even that would have only been a one star deduction from what could have been a four star movie, but Dean ruins the whole thing.

Recommendation:  Skip it.",1153526400,,1033,5.053254437869822
1823765,1,B000083C60,"I love dragons, and I love dragon movies, I also like B grade movies, but this one is bad. The acting was woeful, I mean really really bad, the story was ok.  I tried and tried to like this movie, but I just couldn't.

It might of been because of lack of money, but the same shot of the dragon over and over, flipped and played again was a bit much.

The over use of multiple split-screen shots got a bit annoying, they work well when done right, but in this move they where done all wrong.

If I where you I would stay clear of this one, but then again watching this will make other bad movies better....",1151971200,,605,4.0588235294117645

 The special effects are so-so, I've seen much better but I've also seen worse. The dragon is pretty cool and fairly well rendered. However, the acting and writing are quite bad. And when I say bad, I mean BAD.

 Despite its large flaws, I found DRAGON FIGHTER to be loads of fun. I you like B-Movies, then this is for you. If you don't stay far away.",1147651200,,594,4.5233644859813085

1823798,1,B000083C60,"Aweful. That's the word that best describes the movie. While I love the actor, he can't save the day even if were the real SuperMan. I think what destroys the movie more than the bad script (which us dragon lovers are used to), is the repeated dragon clip they use for most of the dragon shots. 1 shot moving down a hallway.. same shot, reversed. Oh wait lets do it again, and again and again. That's the entire visual effect of the Dragon. 1 clip being reversed like a pancake. Same shot mind you, going left then going right. That's it. That's the big Dragon effect. OMG, just shoot me! I even love B movies but this one was just aweful. I mean, even a bad script can survive if the cgi was halfway decent to make it a B movie but this one is definately F for Flush it!",1126137600,,771,4.1466666666666665
1823799,3,B000083C60,"Sometime in the past of England, some brave nights set out to slay a dragon.  They were not very successful, but the dragon's flame set off their gunpowder and caused a cave-in that trapped the dragon.

In present day, Dean Cain is the new head of security for an underground lab facility.  He arrives piloting a helicopter and bringing with him the lead scientist who is clutching a sample case.  Once at the facility, Dean learns that they are, indeed, performing cloning and that the scientist has a new sample.  He got it in England so you can guess what it is.

An attempt is made at cloning the new sample, it develops much more rapidly than it should and it escapes into the facility.  The facility setting actually made it easier on the animators as all of the sets the creature was in looked the same and only allowed one posture.  A few plot twists put a time limit on when the survivors must get out of the facility and the tension builds.  The ending is typical but still fun with a few shades from other movies.

The odd part of the movie is that the new Head of Security seems to have no security clearance and everyone outranks him.  He cannot open doors and much of the facility is off-limits to him.  There seems to be a complete lack of security systems (although there are some lab cameras that conveniently stop working when the plot demands).  This all makes the film lighter than was probably intended but does add to the entertainment value of the film.",1100736000,,1476,4.462686567164179
1823800,4,B000083C60,"Director Philip Roth rises above the B movie status in this cleverly filmed sci fi movie.  By using multiple screen shots and loading us with a cache of completely unbelievable characters, he focuses mainly on the genetically engineered dragon, and that's why this movie is fun.

For a low budgeter, the dragon effects are very good; unfortunately, the CGI guys don't do as well with the helicopter scenes, but since the dragon is the star, who cares?

Dean Cain gives another one of his earnest, good guy performances as the security guard who saves the day.

The movie is fun to watch and we can predict the ending, but if you like good old fashioned fun, this one passes.",1094601600,,674,4.638655462184874
1823801,2,B000083C60,"Read on before you remark, ""Duh! Dragons unrealistic? As If!""

 No, seriously, the dragon isn't the problem. It looks like a screen shot from a video game, and it doesn't seem to have to eat for fuel for growth, flight or firebreathing, but at least you understand its motivation, and it behaves in a consistent and believable fashion.

 And the basic premise is really no harder to believe than with dozens of other movies - very Jurassic Park. I could swallow the premise more easily than I could, for example, ""Farenheit 9/11"" (another fictional work but one sorely lacking charismatic reptiles.)

 No, the major flaw of Dragon Fighter is the character development of the humans. They behave inconsistently and completely at-odds with what we know humans to be. The leads, for example, see a string of their friends and compatriots die (this is hardly a spoiler, since it is true of almost any movie with the word ""dragon"" OR ""figher"" in the title) and yet are laughing and joking just as soon as they think they've made their escape. More battles, near-death experiences and fallen-friends later, they make another escape at the end of the movie... and arrange a date. Yes, a date.

 It's sad when the monsters are more realistic than the people. And it makes this movie rather annoying to watch.",1090713600,,1300,4.798206278026906

1823804,4,B000083C60,"Dragon fighter was a pretty decent flick.  I personally like B-movies, and this was one of the better ones recently.
The plot - who cares?  A poor man's reign of fire.  By cloning some remains, russian scientists bring back a 1,000 year old dragon.  Of course it runs amok.  The world is in danger, and it's up to Dean Cain to come to the rescue.  There you go.
The thing about this one is that it featured some really cool camera work.  The cinematography was great, and made for a really cool looking movie.  Whoever the director was, they should give him a try at a big budget movie.  The sound was also top notch, but could have been better in the surround department.  My only gripe with this DVD is that it isn't presented in Widescreen format.  Other than that, it makes for a great rental.",1062979200,,797,4.35374149659864

But i enjoyed this because it stars my favourite actor DEAN CAIN. He is a talented actor so why he takes roles in low-budget movies i don't know, to pay the rent for sure. But at least it keeps him in work.
I was pleasantly surprised by Kristine Byers who co-stars.
Having said that, low-budget movies at least provide work for the many actors/actress of all nationalities. Most of the cast were Bulgarian, which was the location for the film.",1052784000,,585,4.376146788990826
1823806,2,B000083C60,"Hey, I understand this movie is DTV. I understand that there was little-to-no budget on this film. And I'm cool with it. But even acknowledging that, ""Dragon Fighter"" still isn't that great of a movie. Why? Because it's a rip-off of every isolated-area monster film since ""Anaconda."" A giant CGI creature is hunting down worthless characters one by one in a secluded spot that eventually blows up in the end. Dean Cain stars as Dean Cain in this film, proving once again that while he can always seem like a real nice guy, he's just not that good of an actor. The monster in this movie is a dragon, but it's a small dragon, about the size of a sports car. And it breathes very little ammounts of fire. I suppose it's a baby dragon, but it's not all that scary. And it looks very, very fake. UFO Films generally does a decent job with their CGI, and while this doesn't hit their rock-bottom worst (like ""Boa""), it does get low. Phillip Roth directed what could've been a little bit cool but instead is just a retread of every other B-monster movie in the past 10 years. I did like how it seemed to parody Michael Crichton in a few areas, but that's about as creative as it gets. The characters are very annoying (except the cook), the scenes are horrendously predictable, and the acting is very, very bad. In short, if you like B-movies with cheesy acting and a contrived plot, you'll enjoy ""Dragon Fighter."" Everyone else should see ""Reign of Fire.""",1050883200,,1449,4.513307984790875

To begin with, there's a mad scientist with anger issues (Robert Zachar as Dr. Ian Drackovitch), who wants to circumvent the `rules' to clone a dragon from ill-gotten DNA.  Naturally, he just happens to have a secret bunker buried deep in the ground where a team of crackpot scientists work to clone endangered or extinct animals.  (I saw a puppy and a rabbit among their stock; I don't believe either is extinct or endangered).  Captain David Carver (Dean Cain) joins their company as the new security officer.  Of course, their `experiment' goes horribly wrong when they instantly grow a BIG dragon who apparently doesn't like being confined.  From that point on it's fight or flight, eat or be eaten.  Not helping matters is the arrogant Dr. Drackovitch, who tries to undermine their attempts to kill his baby.  As if that wasn't enough, they have an onsite reactor that starts counting down.

For some reason, the filmmakers decided to take a humorous approach to the idea of a man-eating dragon on the loose.  Everything is kept light and fluffy.  Dean Cain plays his role as a chatty bumpkin who morphs into a gung-ho take charge guy then ends his routine as a hopeless flirt.  Very little of what he does makes any sense but then none of the characters are fully realized.  More is made of the dragon but then they don't give it nearly enough onscreen time.  They also tried to jazz things up with some visual trickery involving split screen images (which might have looked more impressive in a widescreen format rather than the proffered full screen).

I kind of sort of like it (that says more about my willingness to make allowances for the shoddy way they made this movie than the movie itself).  It had its moments.  I've seen worse.
