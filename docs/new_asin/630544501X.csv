1022147,5,630544501X,"Mary Pickford was the most powerful, popular and influencial woman of Hollywood from 1910 - 1937. Co-founder of United Artists Studios in 1919, wife of Douglas Fairbanks the swashbuckling Silent film star (1919-1936). Owner of numerous companies and the hostess to the most lavish Hollywood parties during this period at her famous estate ""PickFair"" (named after her & husband Fairbanks).
Mary Pickford has been absent from the general public but the ""Mary Pickford Foundation"" has restored and digitalized some of her most memorable films. (She did over 200 such 2 & 3 reelers films from 1908-1927).
""My Best Girl"" was her last silent film and one of her best with actor Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers her frequent and later her husband (1937 - 1976).
This movie has chemistry with her and Buddy. It provides us with an emotional roller coaster ride and a love story everyone will enjoy. Mary Pickford has screen presence and you quickly understand why she became ""America's Sweetheart"" and even had the title of the ""Worlds Sweetheart"" abroad.
The new ""orignal symphonic score"" by David Michael Frank is absolutely fantastic and adds to this delightful silent classic.
You haven't many choices to see digitally restored Silent Classic Film Stars of old but with Foundations like Mary Pickfords we can once again enjoy the magic of silent storytelling through the genious of visual acting talents of the great ones like Mary Pickford.
Included extras are some home movies of Mary and Buddy. A nice personal touch to their private & public lives.
Enjoy this silent romantic comedy and escape for 79 minutes to another time in Hollywood. Mary Pickford is ""My Best Girl"" and ""America's Sweetheart"".",997660800,6,1688,5.075539568345324
1022148,5,630544501X,"Mary Pickford is not especially famous for her comedy skills, but in My Best Girl she shows that she could be extremely funny. This film is at times hilarious, but it is also deeply touching. It is Pickford's ability to convey emotion which makes her so irresistible. The viewer believes in her character and cares about what happens to her.
This was Pickford's last silent film which is a great pity for it is one of her best. Her career in talkies did not last and this is a further pity for her acting ability was such that she could have gone on to play character parts in the way that Lillian Gish did. My Best Girl should thus be treasured as one of her last great films and one of her last great roles.
The print used for this DVD is sepia tinted for day scenes and blue tinted for night scenes. For the most part it looks wonderful, but there are a few places where it shows its age. There are some brief moments where the print shows decay, but this damage does not in any way spoil the enjoyment of the film.
The DVD includes as an extra feature some brief footage of Pickford's marriage to her My Best Girl co-star Charles `Buddy' Rogers. Some of the other Milestone Pickford DVDs include as extras examples of her early short films. I would have preferred one or two of these rather than the newsreel footage included here. But this is to quibble for this DVD remains indispensable for silent film fans.",985046400,5,1415,4.38403041825095

I mean, here she was married to the dashing Douglas Fairbanks at the time when she's canoodling with Buddy Rogers in the movie... And Buddy's sooo handsome and charming! (Have you seen him in 'Old Man Rhythm' 1933)

Mary's performance is wonderful too, she's got the character down (her mannerisms and facial expressions are right on). So, endearing, this movie is one of my fave silents.",1207180800,2,552,4.872340425531915
1022344,5,630544501X,"This is the Pickford Flick to Pick!

You simply can't go wrong with MY BEST GIRL. The plot is one you've seen a million times, but it just doesn't matter. This film is so engrossing and transporting that you'll swear it's all brand new. The performances, direction, settings, music, humor, you name it -- all are pitch perfect.

If you've never seen a silent film, this is the one to see. If you know someone who thinks silents aren't worth seeing, show them this one. If you'd like to see a silent film that really holds up in the 21st century, search no further. If you're feeling down or depressed, see this film. If you need a date movie in a pinch, grab this one. If you'd just like to sit back, relax and watch a DVD that's fun, entertaining and top-notch in virtually every way... well, you know the answer.

If there is a flaw -- and this is nitpicking -- it would be an extended sequence toward the end that veers dangerously close to going over the top. Otherwise, it's sweet, charming, romantic and old-fashioned in the best possible sense, but never cloying or saccharine. It's simple, straightforward, predictable... and perfect. MY BEST GIRL is one of the very few films, silent or otherwise, that I can't imagine anyone disliking. And it has tremendous rewatchability -- an important factor when considering a purchase.

A word about the new musical score: David Michael Frank NAILS this movie. This is, hands down, one of the best silent film scores I've heard. It adds major impact to an already strong film, and don't be surprised if the breezy themes bounce around your head for weeks after viewing.

Am I gushing? You better believe it! After writing all of this, I just can't help myself... I gotta go watch MY BEST GIRL!",1118966400,9,1742,4.606451612903226
1022345,5,630544501X,"There are those films that I would recommend to people who like that genre (EG ""for those who like silent films, they would like this one""), but on a rare occasion I will recommend one to anyone.

Mary Pickford plays the archetype of her former Little Mary roles. She is Maggie, a stock girl at a fictional five-and-dime store... if you read Amazon's review you know the basic plot, which probably isn't the most original. Here's why you should see it:

Unlike too many of her vehicular films, Mary Pickford isn't the only reason to see ""My Best Girl."" About every character is a delight to see, and Maggie's parents deliver some of the best laughs, although Pickford holds her own at some very funny moments. Try not to smile at the scene when she first appears. The goofy melodrama with Liz and her beaux could make another feature comedy by itself, but here it adds to the richness of the film. The blase look on Millicent's face when Joe runs off to find Maggie is priceless. For that matter, so is the subtle look on Maggie's face after she tells Joe about the ""Dramatic club"" her sister belongs to. The soundtrack undermines some of the comedy at times, but that's no reason to turn the volume off. You'll find yourself humming the catchy jazz theme that plays when Nick Powell is present.

So, ""for those who like silent films,"" this is one of the most harmlessly enjoyable, and for those who don't -- well, this is one you should see. It might change your mind.",1100304000,16,1469,4.515037593984962
1022346,3,630544501X,"Mind you, I like silent films, but---if you are not particularly clued-in herein---you should be aware that many silents have a reputation that just cannot be second-guessed.  Almost all, if not all, reviews of silents deemed to be classics are raved about.  I'm inclined to this view owing to the fact that it appears only silent film fans remain interested in this genre.  If you have seen at least a dozen such films you are in a minority.  Most folks, I'd reckon, have either seen dozens, zero, or but a handful.  It's rather understandable, consequently, who would be inclined to take the time to write a review & this goes a long way in explaining the almost universially positive responses.  My Best Girl, staring Mary Pickford, is not one of the greatest films you're likely to come across.  Neither is it one of the great romantic comedies of all time.  Rather, it is an amusing film generally, with a few stand-out scenes.  For its time it can be a host of things, but viewed non-historically, it's a simple film.  Pickford meets a guy in her place of work.  She takes a liking to him  as she tries to show him the ropes of her department.  Little does she know that he is simply trying to prove something to his father by working---under an assumed name, of course---in his father's store.  He is already engaged to a ritzy gal, but nevertheless begins to fall for Pickford.  The two gals bump into one another; Pickford runs off in a huff.  He chases after her. Her employer/the man's father then attempts to bribe her with $10,000 if she'll turn her back on the supposed man of her dreams.  Then follows the worst scene in this film as she marquerades in her kitchen, trying to make her guy believe her affections were all a put-on; ie., that she knew all along who he really was & that she was, and remains, a gold-digger.  Then she collapses into his arms from exhaustion, not being able to effect this lie with any success.  End of story for Cinderella and her prince.  That's what many say about this film---that it's a wonderful Cinderella story.  You would, however, be much better served---and entertained---were you simply to watch the real Cinderella; or so would be my advice.  Long live the silents, I say.  But let's be realistic too---not every effort by Pickford, Chaplin, Lillian Gish, Harold Lloyd, Keaton, Gilbert, et al can stand the test of time...even though I would term them artistic geniuses, generally.  Cheers!",1100044800,5,2448,4.679156908665106
1022347,5,630544501X,"This is the story of a girl destined to become an old maid; she feels she has to take care of her crazy family. She is sweet and sane. She works at a five and dime store where she meets a man named Joe. Joe is rich but was forced by his father to prove himself outside of his wealth. Joe must work in a regular job and receive a raise. In the process, he meets Mary Pickford's character and falls in love.

This movie is interesting to watch because ten years after it was made, Buddy Rogers and Mary Pickford were married. Their chemistry is obvious. It is also a wonder that Mary was around the top of the hill when she made this and yet she still looked so young and beautiful. Emotions soar out of this film that are felt in movies of today. One never notices that it is silent; it simply isn't an issue.

One of my favorite scenes is when Mary deliberately pushes her belongings off of the car she is riding on so that she can see Buddy for just a little longer.

This silent was made when sound took the world by storm. Sadly, it was Mary Pickford's last. Because of the time period it was made in, it is more advanced than a film from the 1910s. The score is very good and the story holds up.",1057449600,12,1199,4.072033898305085
1022348,5,630544501X,"I'm just sobbing like a baby!
My husband just surprised me for my birthday with 'My Best Girl'.  I have been building my silent movie collection for almost 2 years, and not one actress has ever moved me so much as Mary Pickford!
I adore her in every film I've seen thus far, and all the others are DEFINITELY worth buying--bad prints or no, but this...this film is now my favorite Pickford film and in my Top 10 for all silents.
I am not a sappy girl, nor do I fall for romance-type films, but 'My Best Girl' is SO winsome, and SO charming!  Please go off and read at least one Pickford biography and then rewatch 'My Best Girl'. I was so skeptical, b/c I'm not a big girly movie fan, but this is one you HAVE to own if you love Pickford!  Her leading man in the film is Charles 'Buddy' Rogers, the man she married 10 years after this film was made.  At the time, her idyllic marriage to Douglas Fairbanks was just beginning to falter.  They divorced in 1935, and two years later, she became Mrs. Buddy Rogers.  Buddy is so smitten (in a tastefully restrained way) in every scene, in real life, and it's so lovely to watch him falling nutty-head-over-heels for Mary. It's anyone's guess if Mary felt the same--a tribute to her gifts as an actress--but it was pure bliss trying to guess if she had been!
Funny, smart and BEAUTIFULLY shot (if you've seen a lot of silents, you can tell that this one was made toward the end of the era.  You're in for SUCH a treat--the shots are nothing like any in other silents of the same age.)  I laughed out loud, and shed big ol' 'I'm not a girly movie fan' tears!
Treat yourself, and buy the Milestone copy.  An excellent, clean print, with wonderful sharpness and great picture quality.  The few and far between muddy spots go away SO quickly.  And the score is so thoughtful, and complements the action and the period impeccably.  Buy it up, and send a message to the Pickford Foundation that we want more of these DVDs QUICK!
There are a few home movies & newsreel clips from the Pickford Foundation collection included on the MILESTONE DVD, and watching them just tickled me to no end.  All of them were private reels of Mary and Buddy at their wedding, their honeymoon, and later.  Again, being not a terribly romantic girl, I sure surprised the heck outta myself by sobbing out loud after reading that ""Buddy was always fond of saying that he'd married his 'best girl.'""
A sap I was not, until now!",1054598400,34,2442,4.397777777777778
1022349,5,630544501X,"I've seen quite a lot of silent and this one, even if it's not technicaly or visualy in the class of Sunrise, Metropolis or the other great masterpieces of the silent era, has a special place in my heart. I can compare the viewing experience I had with the one I had with The quiet man. Why? Everyone in this movie seems to have fun, same thing with The quiet man. This was I think the second or third Mary Pickford film I saw and up to this point I though she was funny, charming and beautiful but with her performance in this movie you can say that she can do anything. She played drama splendidly and she can break your heart with a smile or a facial expression. If you're a fan of Mary like me, this is probably you're favorite too, some of the other movie she did were more technical or more visual but this one is simply magical. The chemistry with her future husband of the time (Buddy Rogers) is as strong as Bogie-Bacall or Hepburn-Tracy . The story is basic and simple and there's no visual feast like in some other classics but it works and Mary shows us that she was and will always be, the one and only america's sweetheart. She was a very good actress and it's too bad she doesn't get the respect she deserves. Thank god for restoration of the old silent movies, other generations than our grandparents can watch her greatness and see that Chaplin was not alone as a great silent star. Back to the movie, the restoration is pretty good and the film looks great for a 1927.

1022350,4,630544501X,"I saw this movie at the library and decided to give it a try, for I had never seen a silent film and I wondered what it would be like to watch something where noone is talking. I wondered what it was like when my Grandma was young and this was all the movies they had to go to...I also thought it would be an educational experience for my children to view a silent film, and educational for myself and my 19 yr. old daughter to see how camera technique and all that was done for a silent film (We have been studying the art of film in a casual way).
Well, this was really a good watch. I was prepared to be bored, you know, with no talking. But the film quality was beautiful (sepia tones for all day shots, and a darker blue hue was used for the night scenes, the images very clean and crisp)and the music that went along was very nice. I was amazed at how you could easily follow what was going on,(I found I was able to lip read the movie characters quite well!) and that very few ""dialog cards"" were needed. My children (ages 19, 10, and 4) all enjoyed this movie. The 2 young ones got a lot out of the humorous moments.  This movie impressed my 4 year old; for a few days later he was playing and quoted one of the dialog cards (we had read them out loud so he could know what they said), one about, ""Let's get busy and open this crate of mouse traps"". He will quote many lines from movies, but it was funny that he would quote from a SILENT one! It was fun to see a picture of life in the 1920's, with the old cars, strange fashion, etc. It was a very good story, and although I wouldn't want a steady diet of silent films,we would be happy to see more silent movies of this quality, and with Mary Pickford.

The ""masquerade"" of a rich man as a common man was often used in silent movies too (in ""It"", for example). Who can't still relate to this?

7888954,5,630544501X,"Mary Pickford, who will always be forever known as ""America's Sweetheart"" and a pioneer of early Hollywood and shaping the industry but also for being the first talent who had so much power in Hollywood and joined Douglas Fairbanks  (who would end up being her husband), Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith  to create the film studio United Artists.  As well as being one of the original founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and building her legacy as one of the greatest female actresses of all time.

Known for her work in silent films such as ""Stella Maris"", ""Amarlilly of Clothes-Line Alley"", ""The Poor Little Rich Girl"", ""Tess of the Storm Country"", ""Pollyanna"" to name a few, towards the end of her silent film career, Pickford would star in her final silent film ""My Best Girl"", a romantic comedy that did fairly well in 1927 earning over a million dollars during its first run and a film most notable as it paired Mary Pickford and Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers (Pickford would marry Rogers in 1937, a year after her divorce to Fairbanks).

""My Best Girl"" is about a woman named Maggie Johnson, an overworked employee at the Merril Department Store who works as a stock girl and hopes to one day become a sales girl.  As her friend at the sales counter goes on a break, she asks Maggie to watch her counter for a short time.  Maggie looks at this opportunity to show her boss that she can work in sales and the first person she tries to impress on the job is Joe Grant, unbeknown to Maggie is that Joe is not a shopper but is actually the new employee who is going to work at the department store in the stocking department alongside with her.

While trying to help train him in the stock room, Joe seems to not know how to open crates or do anything and thus dubs him ""The Dumbest Stockboy in the World"".  But as the two continue to work together, she finds herself attracted to him.  But there is more to Joe Grant than Maggie knows.  He is actually the son of Joseph Merril, the department store owner who is secretly working at the Department Store and is happily engaged to another rich woman named Millicent.

One day after work as the other sales clerks flirt with Joe, she rides on the back of a truck (as she heads back home).  But Maggie looks at the opportunity for her to flirt with Joe by accidentally dropping things out of the truck and thus Joe having to pick it up and run after her.  And she keeps repeating it until he eventually jumps on the back truck to ride with her towards her home.

Maggie takes Joe back home, wanting to cook him a meal but we learn that her family situation is not too quiet as her sister Liz is a rebellious Flapper (a term for a woman in the '20s who were liberal and independent) dating a guy who gets into trouble and her mother is constantly weepy that her elderly postal worker father has to make her sniff ink or salts in order to calm her nerves.  Maggie tries to pass off her family's dramatics to Joe that her sister is in a theater and is acting out a part.

But if anything, Maggie makes up for it the day after when she cooks him a meal and feeds him in the stockroom of the store and eventually, the two share their first kiss and the two become even closer with each other.

Meanwhile, Joe's mother is preparing an engagement dinner for he and Millicent and Joe knows he will need to tell Maggie the truth about his true identity and that he is engaged.  But what happens when Maggie learns by circumstance of the truth about Joe?

VIDEO:

""My Best Girl"" is presented in 1:33:1 in black and white and color tinting.  The good news is that ""My Best Girl"" is fortunately one of the films maintained by the Pickford Corporation that is in good condition.  The whole film is intact with maybe a few missing frames and there is a few frames that have print damage but for the most part, the film is in good condition and there is not excessive dust, scratches that prevent the enjoyability of the film.  There really isn't any bad news but the very few areas of the film that do have print damage but not the kind that takes over the whole screen, it's usually at the side of the negative and it's not long at all.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

The audio is presented in Dolby Digital stereo featuring a wonderful symphonic score by David Michael Frank.  The music fits the film perfectly and definitely one of the better silent film scores for a Pickford film out there.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""My Best Girl - The Milestone"" comes with the following special feature:

  * Home Movies and Newsreel Clips - (3:44) Featuring home movies of Mary Pickford's marriage and honeymoon with Buddy Rogers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I started my research and viewing on Mary Pickford films, the hardcore silent film fans recommended ""My Best Girl"" as a film I should start out with.  And I admit that I was a bit bewildered by the recommendation because it was Mary Pickford's final silent film and most of the films that she was known for, were for the roles playing a younger character or a dual role.  But after watching this film, I can tell you that I absolutely enjoyed this film.

First off, this is a romantic comedy that can be easily be seen as a rags-to-riches story as Mary Pickford plays a role of a young, over-worked woman who works in the stockroom and she falls for a man which she does not know is the son of the owner of the department store, let alone a wealthy young man who is engaged to a wealthy woman.  The story establishes how the character of Maggie is very close to her family but without focusing on the financial side of the family, the film focuses on how two people who can be seen as opposites falling for each other.

Mary Pickford is no doubt a master when it comes to her presence and what she wants to be seen onscreen, she does a magnificent job portraying a variety of emotions throughout the film, may it be happiness, sadness, flirtation, etc. And the onscreen chemistry with her and Buddy Rogers works quite well for this film.  Granted, there is a 12-year age difference between both talent but Pickford throughout her silent film career has had a nack of playing characters that were younger and in this case, despite being 35-years-old as opposed to Rogers who was only 23-years-old at the time, their chemistry is believable.

But one of the most memorable scenes from the film includes shots of Buddy Rogers running after Mary Pickford in a busy street with the old Los Angeles buildings and advertisements as the scenery.  What a nostalgic scene, let alone a hilarious scene from the film.

Overall, I can see now why many silent film fans, especially Mary Pickford fans have recommended this film to me.  Featuring solid performance by the talent of the film, especially the overly weepy mother Ma Johnson (played by Sunshine Hart) and the tired/panicky father Pa Johnson (played by Lucien Littlefield). Carmerlita Geraghty as the troublesome young flapper sister also did a good job although I wonder if flappers at the time felt the character was too judgmental in terms of the negative portrayal of flappers.  And as a side note, Golden Era cinema fans can see actress Carole Lombard in a very small role as a flirty blonde trying to hit on Joe before the popular truck scene.

""My Best Girl"" is a wonderful silent romantic comedy that has plenty of gags and dramatics to make this film, a fitting final silent film for ""America's Sweetheart"" Mary Pickford.  Definitely recommended!",1276646400,2,7485,4.514455151964418

Within 10 minutes, they were completely involved.  This film is well made and interesting.  My students were asking a host of questions at the end of the film - which is a wonderful result of Pickford's acting ability.",1237334400,3,390,4.776119402985074
