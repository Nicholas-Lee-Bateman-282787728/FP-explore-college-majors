8310565,3,B001IAJK84,"Earlier this year I came upon this item for a very reasonable price or so I thought because a few days ago I popped this into my DVD player just so I could watch santa and the three bears.  The only problem with this was I only got to see the first half of this show and then it cuts off and I say this because I used to watch this on tv and it doesn't get to the parts where the mother bear confronts the ranger or where the ranger tries to brave the snowstorm to make the two cubs christmas more cheerful.  Plus from what I have seen it also looks like the christmas burro you only get the first 7 minutes of the special which also didn't seem to tell the entire story while some of the other specials like the alpha bots and some of the shorts seems to give you the full cartoon.  In closing, I don't get on why whoever put this collection together would not at least make sure to give us the full specials or just leave them out and if you are wanting to add some of these specials to your holiday collection such as santa & the 3 bears or christmas burro you might be better off to look at past this one or like me buy it if it's cheap enough otherwise you may not be so happy during the holidays.",1354752000,,1202,3.958677685950413

It arrived so quickly that my daughter called & said Mom, what is this for - should I send it back?
Grest service, excellant delivery, will shop with this person again!",1327276800,,278,4.166666666666667
8310567,5,B001IAJK84,"If you appreciate the original hand drawn animation of the early to mid 20th century and enjoy a variety, this collection is great.  Many classic Christmas tales.  My seven year old enjoys each and every one of the stories, multiple times.",1270771200,,239,4.804878048780488
8310568,1,B001IAJK84,"I bought this movie 4 my children thinking that it was going to be cute classics. And well they are but from the 60s! Oh my!  the pics are hoorible and the sound! they even included a tv show about christmas.  cartoons then allow a lot of violence, not to mention the extreme poor quality!",1231286400,2,289,4.236363636363636
