566208,4,6303114954,"As of late, the S train has been full steam ahead in the 90's action department hitting monumental strides. We have come across so many hidden gems lately that we really had no choice. Now being ensconced in 90's action velvet is a very fine thing, but we cannot neglect our B horror counterparts which have been so very vital to us over the years. You really can't have one with out the other. It's the Ebb and flow of Sid's existence that must being executed to perfection. With that said we stumbled upon a nice vault of Full Moon B with another lesser known flick called Lurking Fear. If there's one time period you can really enjoy Full Moon then it'd be the early-mid 90's. That doesn't mean this time period offered up solid legitimate theater for the conventional masses. But these films are extremely satisfying to the B lovers looking for nothing more then some mere entertainment. This was a time when Full Moon tried just hard enough to make the films watchable. Now they're slapped together sloppily like one of Santa's triple deckers the day after Thanksgiving. Uhh... where you gonna eat that?

Lurking Fear opens up with ""the feel"" we've always loved from the 90's. The grainy quality, poor sound, and California surroundings were right up there with the best of them. We are introduced to a just-released jail bird by the name of John Mertense who narrates his every move like a very B grade Wonder Years episode. I guess the narration was attempted to really explore the studio space. Now that he's out he has one mission...to recover his degenerate family fortune supposedly hidden in some graveyard in a hick town called Leffert. Now John's Dad was a lifetime criminal and apparently worked up a nice debt to some maniac tough guys who are also after the same fortune. When they stumble into the graveyard they find a few people held up in the local church. They're preparing for a zombie attack from these sweet looking creatures that live under the ground. They all wind up fighting for their lives against this pack of sub human creatures, to find out that they're actually John's family members. Yeah the stories a bit all over the place, but that's what a good B is all about. In the end John and a couple of the other set up some sweet explosions and blow the creatures into oblivion.

With Lurking Fear you'll be enjoying the typical 90's Full Moon that we've come to know and love. If you grew up with these films, then you'll understand the feeling they put off. This may be a contributing factor to why some people just hate movies like this. Sure they're awful, but that's the beauty behind them. These mangloid creatures slugging around the underground are pretty great looking as far as low budgets go. This was the last decade to still whip up some really awesome B monsters as opposed to using really B grade computer graphics. We need a resurgence of these style movies big time. The trash they pump out now has no redeeming value, so what would be the harm in bringing back straight to video gems like Lurking Fear? With all the issues in today's society maybe all we need is a little quality B horror and action again.",1343520000,,3156,4.593971631205674
566209,5,6303114954,I got this in little time. Quality is awesome. A great edition to any Horror film library. With Ashley(Hellraiser 1&2 as Kirsty)laurence starring in a sort of female Rambo lead followed by Jeffery Combs as a crazed doctor(Again!!!)this neat adaption while low budget pulls many surprises until the explosive end. This is the way many B-Movies before and after should be filmed. If you are a fan of these actors and H.P.Lovecraft films then you definitely don't want to pass this one up. Vincent Schiavelli(Buffy the vampire slayer's gypsey leader)has a great cameo as Skelton Knaggs and its a gas. I have seen bigger budget adaptions of H.P.Lovecraft that doesn't hold a candle-or a piece of dynamite-to this wonderful tale of Horror. Sit back in your Crypt and enjoy this Ghoulish tale. Got this from WellCaredFor4less and am very pleased with this Fullmoon producton.,1335398400,3,869,5.041666666666667
566210,4,6303114954,"This is a 75-minute film adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft short story. The writer and director (John Finch) have taken the somewhat cerebral tale, and tarted it up with a crime story backdrop: there's a family patriarch who was recently buried, reputedly with a hefty stash of cash sewn into his chest cavity. A few shady characters ride into town and threaten the locals, wanting to know the location of the grave. The catch, of course, is that a few ghouls residing near the cemetary don't want the body found. And what a fun bunch they are.

This is one of the more entertaining Lovecraft adapatations available. It's not quite top-drawer in the manner of The Ressurected or The Call of Cthulu, but it's a much better bet than a few of them out there. Filmed in Bucharest, Romania circa 1994, the film does take advantage of aging buildings to provide atmosphere. Plotwise, the director has stuck with Lovecraft's New England flavor, but a Romanian farm village doubling as 'Leffert's Corners' has to be taken with a grain of salt. The gang of crooks are driving a classic '62 Impala convertible with license plate frames advertising a dealer in 'Arkham, MA', a nice touch for fans. For good measure, Re-animator's Jeffery Combs plays the town doctor, with hammy relish. It doesn't hurt that one of the more slimy characters eventually gets his heart ripped out, either. Overall, it's a nice trip for those into the gothic horror genre.

A brief (but informative) making-of film is included as an extra, along with the trailer.",1298505600,5,1529,4.809885931558935
566211,3,6303114954,"A group of unsuspecting thieves are caught in one town's struggle for survival when a search for hidden treasure leads them into the bowels of a cursed church that is guarded by hideous monsters. Director C. Courtney Joyner aspires for the same level of success as Stuart Gordon had achieved in PIT AND THE PENDULUM with this low-budget H.P. Lovecraft tale, but unfortunately he falls short due to the uneven pacing and passable performances. Jeffrey Combs is wasted here as the town's doctor, but HELLRAISER's Ashley Laurence comes through as another strong female protagonist. LURKING FEAR only has a few fleeting bursts of energy throughout the majority of the plot, with the characters spending most of their time bickering and waiting for death in the empty church. Things finally pick up towards the end, when the floorboards give way and drop the last remaining survivors into the demons' lair. While the creature designs are genuinely frightening, the cheapness of the latex costumes is always apparent. Lovecraft fans are better suited with films like DAGON or CASTLE FREAK, but LURKING FEAR does prove to be a gory and mildly entertaining adaptation.

566212,2,6303114954,"Lurking Fear (C. Courtney Joyner, 1994)

The one good thing I can say about Full Moon Entertainment, the undisputed king of bad straight-to-video horror movies since the mid-eighties, is that when you pop in a video (or DVD, now) from Full Moon, you know what you're going to get. C. Courtney Joyner, who also directed the Full Moon classic Trancers III, helms this Lovecraft adaptation that even manages to make Brian Yuzna's hilarious Dagon monstrosity look worthwhile.

John Martense (Head of the Family's Blake Bailey, at the beginning of his extremely short acting career) has just gotten out of prison after serving five years, and is to pay a call on an associate of his late father's, Knaggs (the ubiquitous Vincent Schiavelli). When he shows up, it turns out Knaggs has half of a treasure map. Martense has the other half, discovered in his father's effects. All Martense has to do in order to avoid having to ever do anything that might send him back to prison again is go dig up the money, which is buried in a cemetery in Martense's hometown. Stuffed in a body. (Did I say something about not going back to prison?) Problem is, the town has suffered the depredations of subterranean monsters who only come out when it storms. There's one hell of a storm blowing in, and the remaining residents of the town, led by spunky Cathryn Farrell (Hellraiser's Ashley Laurence), have decided to make a stand against the monsters, with the graveyard being the battleground. Yeah, the graveyard where Martense has to go dig up a couple million dollars stuffed in a dead body. And, of course, the guys who Martense's old man stole the money from? Yeah, they want it back, and they want it back badly enough to come in person, headed by the slick, evil Bennett (Kingdom of Heaven's Jon Finch).

It's a typical Full Moon joint in that the acting is bad, the effects are worse, and the script is laughable. (Why is it that so many Lovecraft adaptations have such awful scripts? Inquiring minds wanna know.) It's a bit less typical in that the supporting cast includes some folks who the average American will actually recognize, them being Laurence (hasn't everyone seen Hellraiser? And if not, for the love of pete, why?), bad-Lovecraft-adaptation alum Jeffrey Combs (From Beyond, etc.), and of course Schiavelli. IMDB reports that Stuart Gordon was originally tabbed as the director for this project, which makes perfect sense given the subject matter and cast. I never thought I'd long for a Stuart Gordon Lovecraft adaptation, but he certainly couldn't have mangled this film as badly as Joyner did. Still, it's watchable, in that train-wreck kind of way, which makes it better by default than about two-thirds of the movies I've watched this week. **",1254268800,2,2751,4.848936170212766
566213,2,6303114954,"I was extremely dissapointed to see how this movie butchered H.P. Lovecraft's original story.

I say this because the movie is still entertaining, has a little bit of gore and a few tensely horrific moments, sports a good cast including the immortal Jeffrey Combs, and has a nice looking ""monster"" design.
  The story is about a now isolated town that, over the years, has been steadily deprived of its occupants by creatures dwelling in tunnels beneath the local cemetery.

There's nothing new or original there.  The action is scattered at best, they don't even take full advantage of the below-dwellers.  The `suspense' couldn't kill anyone, being almost nonexistent.  It's amazing how they took so long to say so little.  None of the performers excelled, even stalwart actor of the overdone, Jeffrey Combs, seemed a little anemic here, not that he was given much to do.

566362,3,6303114954,"70 minutes of terrible...but I couldn't stop giggling while rolling my eyes. And yes, without the credits this really is only 70 minutes.

Really cheap sets and highly questionable acting raise a brow of doubt in the first 90 seconds of this movie.  But don't worry, the writing is bad, too. So you'll get plenty of ""oh, geez"" laughs out of it.  A lot of the scenes feel like they came out of some horror-themed soap opera--which doesn't speak well of the director of this laughable catastrophe.

The first scene sets an interesting tone.  Two women and an infant are staying in some old church with monsters living between the under the floors.  They know these monsters want to eat them, but they spend the night anyway and somehow are able to sleep...alone...with no one keeping watch.  Low and behold, the consequence of this thoughtful plan was that someone got killed by some rubber-gloved monster-clawed arms reaching out from a vent in the wall.

You see, there are these Morlockian troglodytes living under a church and the nearby cemetery.  They grunt and have grey skin and glazed white eyes as you would imagine any typical subterranean corpse-eating creature would appear.

The story brings together three sets of people with different motives to the church...

The first is John Martense, who is released from prison to meet crooked mortician Knaggs (Vincent Schiavelli; Ghost, Lord of Illusions).  After a quick ""how ya' doin'"" John is already planning to commit a crime.  He's going to recover some blood money that was buried with a body in the graveyard by the church.  I know what you're thinking and the answer is yes: that church.
Then there's Bennett, Marlowe (Allison Mackie) and Pierce (Joe Leavengood; Trancers 2; Basket Case 2), three criminals that are after the same money.

Among others, Cathryn (Ashley Laurence; the Hellraiser series, Warlock III), Maria and an alcoholic physician Dr. Haggis (Jeffrey Combs; The Re-Animator, From Beyond) make up the third group.  They seek to eliminate this race of subterranean humanoids of local legend--a legend which is mentioned, but never really explained.

The action scenes are quite bad, ranging from terrible pulled punches to awkward, hardly credible gun handling skills.  The sound effects accompanying the punches remind me of the original arcade version of Street Fighter.  The same goes for all of the altercations with the monsters.  The most credible action was the cemetery mud wrestling brawl between Allison Mackie and Ashley Laurence in the pouring rain.  Go figure.  The male director gave all of his technical attention to a catfight hybrid between a wet t-shirt contest and women's mud wrestling.

The gore is generally weak, but I must credit the effects team and director for making so many attempts to please the Fangoria fans out there.  There are a lot of dead body, corpse and skeleton scenes in which these props are used for more than just background.  They come with a few laughs.  The creature make-up is similarly ho-hum.  But they embrace it.  They don't make you wait until the last 20 minutes of the movie to see it.  You get to see it a lot.  Which means they spent a lot of money on it and took some risks.

This story is evidently based on some work of H. P. Lovecraft.  Other than a weak link between a human church and the creatures, I see no connection to Lovecraft.  It definitely didn't ""feel"" Lovecraftian.  To add to that, the story follows these three groups of people convening on this church.  But we don't have much of a good explanation as to ""why"" the good guys are trying to eradicate these monsters.

Lovecraft fans shouldn't see this.  It will just disappoint them.  But bad horror fans are in for the standard laughs that come with genre.  This movie takes itself very seriously, and that just adds to the fun.",1368835200,7,3834,4.84

Now I know having wasted $8 and 80-some minutes of my life: It should have remained lost. It's an amateurish film. Despite a few good ideas, it's awful. At best, the film is a  curio for Lovecraft aficionados only. Sadly I'm one of them -- which means I've slogged through dozens of terrible films that claim to be adaptations of his work.

Lurking Fear clearly was made by a fan of Lovecraft who did get a lot of the writer's ideas. But it's too much a home movie to count as a serious feature. Joyner went on to write a few fun, low-budget films with Lovecraftian themes. For a much better adaptation of Lurking Fear watch the 1997 feature ""Hemoglobin"" (AKA ""Bleeders"") from director  Peter Svatek featuring French Canadian actor Roy Dupuis. (Amazon has it on DVD -- and VHS -- but not Instant Video.)

The whole thing makes me wonder yet again why no one seems since Stuart Gordon has been capable of making a serious -- as opposed to comedic -- watchable, feature length adaptation of Lovecraft's stories. The three shorts collected in ""Necronomicon: Book of the Dead"" are terrific as are some of the shorts featured in the now defunct ""The H.P. Lovecraft Collection"" DVD series of which there are five volumes. John Carpenter got nicely lovecraft-ian with several of hsi films, brilliantly so, but he never did a straight-up adaptation. The only great contemporary versions is Valdemar Legacy and its sequel.

Every other filmmaker to assay Lovecraft has been a hack, a rank amateur or a moron. Most seem to feel that since they're making a 'literary' adaptation, the film must feature some idiot narrator reading through the story text itself. Look, people, a film adaptation is supposed to use film language and not be a mere audio book. Others think making faux 1920s silent films will do the trick. Huh? Yet others, and this is the death metal crowd, think a Lovecraft story gives them license for ignore narrative and character in favor of gore and filth only.

I've arrived at the point where I just put the films aside, too afraid to watch them only to be disappointed. There are piles of DVDs with Lovecraft's name on them that aren't worth the plastic on which they're pressed.",1457136000,2,2310,4.705445544554456
