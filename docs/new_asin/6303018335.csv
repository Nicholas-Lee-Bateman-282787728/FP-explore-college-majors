7835951,4,6303018335,"Vitaliano Brancati's masterpiece, 'Beautiful Antonio', is a persiflage of the Italian society in the first half of the 20th century with its family honor, macho culture, mixture of fortune / marriage / brothel affairs, the omnipresent influence of the Catholic Church and its political arm (fascism).
For L. Sciascia, the book depicts the 'misfortune of living under a despotism' ('To sleep only with one eye' - Introduction to the Complete Works of V. Brancati).

The scriptwriters of the movie (M. Bolognini, P. Pasolini, G. Visentini) betrayed the meaning of Brancati's book. They wanted to show that not the Italian society as a whole is sterile and hypocritical, but only its bourgeoisie. Only the working class (the proletariat), in the person of a maid, can ensure the future of the country.

The movie doesn't have the same high standard of the book. V. Brancati's text is much more explicit in describing the political, social and religious context as well as the sexual affairs. The supporting characters are much more developed. The tirades, especially those by the father, are much more outspoken and incisive.
In contrast, the movie is too meek and too linear, while the actors, Marcelo Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale, only shine through their photogenic appeal.",1501027200,,1278,5.199029126213592

A smudgy, speckled print of a tenth generation, sixteen millimeter source, it does have English subtitles, which are twice as clear as the image. Does Amazon bother looking at its products? Guess not, although they didn't like my prior review enough to print it.  hfs",1494460800,,316,4.962264150943396

7835954,5,6303018335,"This is a rather early effort from director Mauro Bolognini (1963) and a very rare presentation, perhaps not the greatest, but a rather deserving edition from Cinebx which rather distastefully watermarks the film with possibly their logo.  The film is very watchable nonetheless, somewhat grainy.  There are no extras or menu, but then although Mauro Bolognini has directed dozens of films, only ""The Inheritance"" with Anthony Quinn and Dominique Sanda has a region 1 DVD presentation and that is not particularly good, although the film is one of his masterpieces.  ""Bell Antonio"" tells the graceful story of Marcello Mastroianni and his marriage to Claudia Cardinale and how his dilemma of his being found out to be impotent (which occurs only with women he loves) and the morals and mores of the his parents, the bride's family, the small town hypocrisy, and the position of the Church.  This is all presented with pathos, humor and feeling, all skillfully done by the entire cast, especially Bolognini, screenwriters Pier Paolo Pasolini and Gino Visentini and the beautifully restrained music of Piero Piccioni.  Actor Tomas Milian is also in the cast and hardly recognizable.  This is an important work for the cast and deserves to be seen today.  The work of Mauro Bolognini deserves to be a household commodity and if this release on DVD-R is neither expensive or poor, then it should be welcomed wholeheartedly.  Bolognini was never showy, but his films are consistently enthralling and distinctly recognizable for their masterful impact.  B&W.",1452211200,,1552,5.176

7835956,3,6303018335,"The movie has a great theme that I have never seen duplicated in this day and age where film makers and writers have run out of creativity but the film needs to be restored- very dark and shadowy.  I was wishing I could up the brightness on my DVD player the entire time I was watching it.  If you are a fan of Marcello Mastroianni and Italian film, you will enjoy it and want it in your video library.  If it were restored, I would give it a 5 star rating.",1383609600,,457,4.0
7835957,5,6303018335,"I am 71 years old and first saw this film in a Greenwich Village theater when I was about 22.  I had never heard of Mastroianni, Cardinale, or Pasolini.  My having been a fan of Italian movies was what brought me to this film.  I liked the film then, but understood it only superficially.  At this second viewing 50 years later, I had spent several summers in Italy and, after some study, managed pretty well in Italian.  I had grown in ways which helped me to really appreciate this movie.  My analytical skills, my insights, my first-hand experience the 1950's, my understanding of film--all were much improved over the years.
In observing the technical defects of the film, I think it is important to remember that it is a historical offering.  The views of Catania, the costumes and furnishings, the mannerisms--these things and more add to the tightly bound package that fit seamlessly together.  The corruption of the church and politics, the conventional attitudes that crippled people in the '50's (both in America and other countries), guilt and shame, emotional responses (also very present and just as uncomfortable in the side of my family who were Italian-Americans).
When I think back to so many things this film brings to mind, I see:  good looks overrated, power and money being more important than individuals, lack of communication between and among loved ones, lots of bad advice, unbridled criticism and condemnation--actually, much the same as things are in 2013.  I guess all of this makes this film quite a universal statement.
It is also wonderful to see how Mastroianni developed as an actor and how wonderfully he thrived under better budgets and more insightful direction over the years.
The more I think about it, the more I like it.  5 really big stars.",1381881600,3,1782,4.887043189368771
7835958,1,6303018335,"this is a mediocre film that strips the humor and political critique from vitaliano brancati's book. the one star, however, is really due to the quality of the product - taped from television with simply a DVD jacket. no menu, no subtitle options. way too much money for this home-made project. be careful buying this new proliferation of foreign films online.",1379203200,5,360,4.918032786885246
7835959,5,6303018335,"Leonard Maltin calls this film merely ""OK.""  Well, so much for Leonard Maltin.  It is, in fact, a quite splendid adaptation of Sciascia's marvelous novel, with Marcello (Fellini's ""Marcellino"") in the  role of the handsome Antonio, whose reputation as a ladies' man can't help  him succeed as a lover when he develops true feelings for the girl he's  supposed to marry (played by Claudia Cardinale).  A terrific send-up of  Italian (read: universal) machismo, beautifully done.",963792000,17,477,5.28
