3934467,4,B002HQZX3O,"I love Holiday in Handcuffs. Not solely because I am a big fan of Melissa, Mario and Markie but because the movie has a different twist to it. It was very entertaining, funny, full of sassiness and romance. Of course the end it's pretty predictable but the ride was awesome. All the characters are very well written and the cast selection, I believe was excellent. As far as the Snowglobe, though I believe it to be more of the unrealistic, sappy romance that chick flicks are saturated with, I am partial to Christina's acting. This story line has been done one too many times. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the interaction of her family. From the cast, as side from Christina, I think the best acting came from the least know actors/actresses. And come on you can not beat the 2 for 1 special. It comes out to about 9 per movie.",1264809600,7,830,4.503311258278146

It's a reminder of all the crazy things that can happen at Christmas time, and how just when we think everything's going wrong, things can turn around. However...snow globe, eww. Lame, lame, lame. The plot is poor, the characters bland, just boring. I might actually fall asleep if I tried to describe it.

3934538,5,B002HQZX3O,"I'm a xmas movie lover. I'm a sucker for magical inspiration and happy endings. A departure from reality is A okay with me. I saw both these movies on t.v. and enjoyed them both. Holiday In Handcuffs is humorous and zany. Mario Lopez is always eye candy with a fine blend of physique and humor. And who doesn't like a man with a heart? Melissa Joan Hart has proven her mettle in comedy and there is a chemistry between Lopez and Hart. Snowglobe is a great trip into the magical and imaginary. It's a holiday version of The Wizard of Oz - ""There's no place like home"" conclusion. Christina Milian longs for the idyllic holidays of yesteryear, not the urban dysfunctional family unit she has. The essence of family wins out, but not without alot of departure from the everyday. Neither movie will win an academy award, but if you're looking for lighthearted family entertainment, these provide.",1378857600,,892,4.687898089171974
