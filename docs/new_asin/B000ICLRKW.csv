2654692,5,B000ICLRKW,"I was given a few DVDs as gifts, and this one really stood out as exceptional.  I am always looking for ways to relax as I am a therapist who emphasizes relaxation in my practice. The things I particularly like about this DVD are the clear instructions, the soothing voice, and the wide variety of practices. Also I found the section with the Dalai Lama very inspirational and moving.  This DVD would be valuable for most anyone, and I have recommended it to several people",1168560000,17,473,4.552941176470588
2654693,5,B000ICLRKW,"I received this DVD as a gift, gave it a try, and loved it.  Everything about it spells stress relief.  The seaside set is soothing, as is the instructor's gentle voice.  Her instructions are easy to follow which is particularly important for a yogically challenged person like me.  I highly recommend it.",1166572800,33,305,4.8076923076923075
2654694,5,B000ICLRKW,"I bought this DVD about eight years ago as a very anxious college freshman. Today, as an anxious PhD candidate, I can honestly say nothing has worked better for me than this DVD in managing anxiety. Some caveats: the transitions are indeed weird, and it took a lot of practice for me to figure out what things like a released exhalation even felt like. This is not fitness yoga. That said, it's the best, most affirming yoga for mental and physical health I have ever experienced in a DVD, and the healthiest yoga instruction I've had, period, except for one fantastic teacher. Can't recommend enough.",1491350400,,601,4.733333333333333

2654696,5,B000ICLRKW,Great gift for my girlfriend. She was excited for it.,1489104000,,53,4.4
2654697,1,B000ICLRKW,Think this may be an illegal copy.  Played it once and after that just kept getting an error message and it would not play.  All my other DVD's play ok.,1486771200,,152,4.033333333333333
2654698,5,B000ICLRKW,"This yoga changed my life from one plagued with daily pain to one without. I had a low back/sarcral injury with muscle spasms, and shooting/searing sciatic pain and could not sit comfortably for even short periods of time, the low back pain exercises helped within 2 months of regular practice (after 7 years of pain and physical therapy and massage). Now I can sit for up to 10 hours on long car trips or overseas flights again. I love the adaptive advice Barbara gives with each exercise so you can build your practice as you improve without discomfort. Her directions are clear and calm; I actually voice recorded my favorite sessions on my phone so I can practice them when traveling, camping, etc. I recommended this DVD to my daughter who has chronic neck/upper back pain and she supplements this yoga with her physical therapy and also finds it helpful. It is a style of yoga anyone can do as long as you can get up off the floor. You don't need special equipment. Barbara gives adaptive tools, recommending folded blankets if you don't have bolsters, or a rolled towel if you don't have a yoga strap, for example.",1486425600,,1121,4.63819095477387

2654702,3,B000ICLRKW,I found the editing of this video to be strange. It distracts me from what I'm doing and makes it difficult to follow. I would love an alternative DVD to try as this one was kind of a let down content wise.,1479945600,,206,3.9285714285714284

2654705,3,B000ICLRKW,"i'm a beginner at yoga and this video was just ""ok"". the poses were doable for a beginner, which is good, but going from pose to pose is a little choppy and not as smooth as I've see in other videos.",1477872000,,199,3.8780487804878048

2654708,5,B000ICLRKW,"My favorite yoga video.
The instructor is soothing, and offers multiple levels of positioning.
She focuses on instruction, without demonstrating a whole lot of ego.
There is some emphasis on being gentle with your body and relaxing.
You don't feel bad about refraining from overstretching when you are still in the early stages.
Consequently you feel a whole lot better the next day.",1471996800,,383,5.095238095238095

2654710,5,B000ICLRKW,"I would never buy ""gentle"" yoga DVDs because I thought it was a waste of money.  I realize now that I should have always had dvds like this in my collection.  Having shoulder and neck issues the last few years has driven me to find relief outside of pills.  When I loaded this DVD and saw it had a SECTION for that issue I about %^%$% myself! I LOVE this section.  To me this is more of guided to stretching than yoga, but if you have issues, this is a must buy.  I think the title threw me because I wasn't thinking stress as your muscles, only your mind.  By the end of the dvd, I had relief in both.",1467417600,,602,3.975

2654714,2,B000ICLRKW,Do not like this at all.  Lots of variety of poses but too many detractors for stress relief.  First instructor spends time with every scene folding blankets.  Once is enough.  Scenes do not flow.  Looks like each pose is filmed individually and then thrown together.  Scenery is pretty but not much background music. Worst part is the instructor constantly gives instruction.  She has a soothing voice but I find it very hard to calm my mind with incessant chatter.  Felt my stress level rising with this CD rather than the goal of releasing tension.  Trying without sound isn't really an option since I'm fairly new at this.  Will be looking for other relaxation CDs to replace this one.,1464048000,2,689,4.762711864406779

2654716,3,B000ICLRKW,"As most people who purchase workout videos, you probably have barley used them. I got this during a time I was super stressed out and had barely gotten into yoga. Thinking I could do this at home, I bought this. I honestly used it once or twice? It was ok. A little too slow even for me.",1462233600,,287,4.052631578947368

2654720,1,B000ICLRKW,"I was looking for specific exercises to do to alleviate depression, but this book did not have any. It was just a book telling you that you should do yoga for depression. Such a disappointment.",1457913600,,193,4.542857142857143
2654721,2,B000ICLRKW,"I was greatly disappointed with this DVD. It offers a multitude of segments but its basically one long segment chopped up into different mixes - so there isn't a lot of variation to the moves presented.
Way too much prop use (towels).
Didn't find this to be an aid in stress reduction or even a decent run through basic stretching.
Added nothing to my existing yoga library.",1453939200,,374,4.597014925373134
2654722,2,B000ICLRKW,"I REALLY tried to get through this one, but the yoga instructors' voice and pace of speaking just made this dvd very stressful for me. After about 7 minutes with only two poses (which were very relaxing, but held much longer than i'm used to - not a problem as I understand this is a stress relief series) I wanted to shoot my tv. She just kept talking through the poses and I would have enjoyed it much more if I was given cues and then she stopped talking. Instead she continued to talk through the poses in a rather annoying way and some of it was more of the spiritual side of yoga and just some weird stuff that I really didn't care about. I turned the DVD off put in my Tara Stiles This is Yoga DVD and was automatically much more relaxed. Like I said - voice annoying, poses nice. Maybe I'll try this again with the sound off and just use visual cues.",1452556800,4,858,4.1437125748503

2654737,4,B000ICLRKW,"I practice yoga - and I can tell you it works. You can also use hypnosis in conjunction with yoga. The combination of the two will improve and enhance the benefits and results. Get control of your mind - and reduce the stress.

2654738,3,B000ICLRKW,"I only tried the one 15 minute relaxation section.  Just for that section you need THREE yoga blankets.  Sorry, don't have the money for that.  Plus, folding the blankets took her quite a bit of time...tedious.  I used towels but it probably would have worked alot better with yoga blankets.  I did not find it relaxing & found myself wanting to do my own stretching afterwards.  The other sections might be better but they are all around 35minutes and I didn't have that much time to devote to it.  I will be trying another dvd.",1437523200,,529,4.505263157894737

2654747,5,B000ICLRKW,Wonderful!!! I have purchased about five different DVDs on yoga and haven't been able to get into it. This one is nice. She moves slow enough and the poses are held long enough for me to learn and get benefits from it. I'm glad I have this.,1434067200,,240,4.127659574468085

I take care of a (now) 5 month old child and ride a bike 13-15 miles 4 days a week. I couldn't do it without this. This is the only yoga DVD I have ever liked. To the negative commenters: This DVD promotes therapeutic, restorative positions, it is not a Vinyasa flow. It is effective!",1432944000,,415,4.135802469135802

2654751,3,B000ICLRKW,"This DVD is okay, but I have a few problems with it. My biggest issue: there is absolutely no flow or graceful transition between poses. It is obvious that each pose and stretch was filmed separately and edited together based on what they were trying to achieve in each individual routine. There are times when you go from laying on the floor to standing completely upright, with absolutely no transition whatsoever. At times, this is both jarring and confusing, which makes for a difficult time if you are a beginner or are using this DVD for its intended purpose of relieving stress and tension.

My second-biggest gripe is that the poses in this film, even the ""active"" routines, are very passive. I find that part of what makes yoga so fantastic for relieving stress is that it makes you more aware of the tension in your body, and invites you to actively stretch and breathe the stress away so that when you are done you feel refreshed and revitalized. These stretching routines are probably good as a warm-up into some more physically active exercises, but are very weak when it comes to actually providing a workout.

On the other hand, if you are looking for something that is focused more on the meditation, breathing, and relaxing side of what yoga can provide, this DVD may be what you are looking for. These low-energy poses are probably very good for people over 50 or people who are trying to gain flexibility. There are lots of different routines to choose from, and they vary in length from about 15 minutes to an hour. The instructor Barbara Benagh has a very soothing voice, and she emphasizes the importance of being aware of your breathing while practicing yoga. She also uses lots of props, which is fantastic if you have issues with support and balance. (On a side note, I love the fact that she is not a perfectly-sculpted model simply hired to show off how to do a pose; she looks like an average, middle-aged woman in comfortable clothes who is there to teach, not to intimidate.) There is a wonderful lecture with H.H. Dali Lama included in this DVD, which is a great tool for people who are interested in learning the benefits of meditation being mindful of your spiritual health and presence. However, it should be noted that there are no closed-captioning/subtitle options for those who are hearing impaired or speak another language.

tl;dr : not sure I'd recommend this to everyone, but if you want something that has a variety of passive-pose routines this might be a good option.",1431388800,7,2512,4.71753986332574
2654752,5,B000ICLRKW,This DVD is awesome. You can literally feel the tension leaving your body with each exercise. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who needs to unwind.,1431043200,,167,5.0
2654753,5,B000ICLRKW,"I love this yoga DVD, inevitably I feel better after I use it.  I find the teacher very calming and moving at  a good pace.  It has sections like ""winding down for the day"" or ""lower back"" relief, and sections work as advertised.  For background- I'm not an experienced yoga practictioner- I've only gone to a class about 3 times.  This is just write for using in the evening by myself, and you can save money on yoga fees.  Teacher provides suggestions for props or if a position is difficult to get into.",1430524800,2,506,4.387096774193548

2654764,1,B000ICLRKW,"I don't really get all the positive reviews on this DVD. All the makers of this DVD did was record one routine that she did and then chop all the moves together in various assortments. There is NO continuity or flow. One second she's on the floor and the next she's sitting up so you have to scramble to match her position. One thing that bothered me is that most of these sessions have you starting out laying down on the floor - one for over 5 minutes. Most people needing help to relax (like I do, hence the need for this video) have a hard time just laying down at first, we need to be eased into it - have us lay down for 5 minutes at the END of the routine, not at the beginning. But that is probably just me. Also, I did find some poses to be painful to my back - and I'm relatively young with no back issues - the Cobblers Pose actually hurt my hips and lower back, just a heads up to those who have lower back issues. Considering all the yoga tapes there are out there for relaxation, invest in one that has taken the time to tape multiple full flowing sessions, not one that just took one session and chopped it up into bits.",1423440000,8,1135,4.071428571428571

2654772,5,B000ICLRKW,"Very good for relaxation, with a few major sections.  Beginning and Ending Day (energy and relaxation), Neck, Shoulder, Back (the headache workout has helped) , Easing Mind (relaxation generally) and Stomach/Disgestion.

Some workouts are more active than others, but geared overall to ease stress.",1420243200,,298,5.75
2654773,3,B000ICLRKW,this is an ok yoga dvd. if you live in a small cramped house ...do not get it. there are a lot of poses that are up against walls or with a chai and if you live in a studio it is very difficult. i like how diverse the dvd is though. there are stretches for everything and that really is nice. you can stretch based on your needs not just the same workout every time.,1419552000,,366,3.8289473684210527

2654777,3,B000ICLRKW,"I expected a flow DVD, one with separate routines for each topic selected, but what I got was a bunch of copy-and-pasting of video clips, each one containing different moves and techniques. It didn't flow to say the least and the transitions were very rough between positions. There was absolutely no attempt to smooth them over.
Did it help to relieve stress? Yes. I just expected more quality from a $12 DVD. I had bought a $5 one a few months back and to be honest, I like that one more.",1416182400,,490,4.395604395604396
2654778,5,B000ICLRKW,This was a gift.,1415750400,,16,3.25
2654779,5,B000ICLRKW,"This (and Larry' Paynes Level 1 Immune Boost and General conditioning) are my go- to's when I am under the weather.
Great: Her instruction, cadence & tone (always the most relaxing, non-violent instruction of any yoga instructor anywhere), the sound of the tide behind her and zen ocean-scape, the soothing low tones in music and plenty of time to breathe, send healing into tissues and just relax. I can't find a slower-paced, more deliberate yoga stretch & relaxation tape anywhere. (Except maybe Mimi Solaire's.)
The only critique I have is that, rather than the segments being one fluid routine, its cut and paste of various poses. So, when you do the workout/segment for relaxing the low back: Pose 1 is lying down.  Pose 2, lying down. Cut to pose 3 where she is sitting up, but wait for it.....wait for it....she lies down. Many times I have sat up only to lay right down again. So, editing could have been better.
Also, this is a VERY gentle low back routine (and I keep this video JUST for her teaching on how to do locust pose properly), but there are better stretching/strengthening yoga for backs out there - try Annie Carpenter Yoga Journal back one or Rodney Yee's 'Yoga for Back Care.'",1415664000,,1200,4.687203791469194
2654780,5,B000ICLRKW,"I have some other DVDs with Benagh and have liked them, so when I saw this on sale in a store several weeks ago, I picked it up.

I like the fact that there  are a lot of routines--many relatively short--available. Bodywisdom's site has a complete list of what is available if you are interested. Or check out some of the excellent 5-star reviews.

That being said, I haven't tried all of them. I have concentrated primarily on the ones for hips/back/neck/shoulder (my problem areas). Working on those areas even when there is no immediate pain is helpful and beneficial. I think it can help to reduce the occurrence/severity of problems in the future.

Some of the routines appear to have helped with more immediate problems. For example I was having pain in my neck/shoulder pain about 10 days ago. I tried 2-3 routines and they did seem to provide relief (much less/no discomfort afterwards).

Yes, this is ""slow"" compared to other yoga DVDs. You might do only 5-6 poses in a shorter session . And there is no ""flow"" as such. But a faster tempo with flow is not the point of these routines. I think learning how to do them correctly is one goal. Breathing correctly is another. Most of these aren't really ""workout"" routines; they are designed to help people who have problems in specific areas.

In addition, the slow pace helps one to slow down and really focus/concentrate on what is going on. This can reduce stress in and of itself. I think a slower pace is also a lot more beneficial than quickly running through a lot of poses if the intent is to target specific problem areas. A longer stretch done correctly will generally work better than a short one. People who think these routines are too slow should try ying yoga!

And once people are familiar with poses in a routine they could use them elsewhere or devise  their own routines (with more  flow if desired).

Yes, some of the routines use the same poses? So what? They are beneficial in more than one way.

Clear explanations are used throughout and alternatives using props are provided. People who can't do all the poses exactly as performed in the video should not be discouraged. Keep in mind that Benagh has been practicing yoga for around 30 years. Don't strain too much (can cause injury). Do what you can. Modify a pose as needed. I you don't have the exact same props used in the video you can usually come up with a good substitute that will work just as well. These routines will still be beneficial for YOU (which is the point). With enough practice you will improve.

This DVD is highly recommended, especially for people who are ""beginners"" although I suspect more advanced practitioners would probably find it to be of some use  as well.",1415059200,,2720,4.618257261410788

2654785,1,B000ICLRKW,This DVD was a great disappointment. I was expecting a full yoga program for stress relief. This DVD is broken into 5-15  minute segments focused on a variety of physical maladies. It also requires folded blankets of the same size which was an issue. This DVD did not relieve my stress.

It's nice, short and relaxing, but I am not very flexible and I'm not as thin as her so it is very difficult for me to to do many of the poses that she is doing, especially for long periods of time.

There are segments for stress reduction, anxiety, digestion issues, IBS, constipation, diarrhea, a segment for starting and ending your day slowly, an hour segment for getting letting go of your day, and a revival segment. The video is on a beach with the ocean in the background. the perfect setting! There is even a 30 minute  session the Dahli Lama in order to learn about meditation. This video uses a lot of props for beginners which is helpful. I am intermediate and get a really good workout.

It is peaceful and has many workouts so you can just pick by how you feel and how much time you have.  She has a soothing voice, and it is a calming environment.  This is a great addition to my other yoga DVD's.  It incorporates similar exercises, but also adds some you just don't see everywhere.  A lot of yoga DVD's only focus on sun salutations...it's nice to have a more comprehensive, & relaxing options as well.  I may have to check out some of her other DVD's.

The are about 20 routines with countless number of poses (asanas).  I tried putting together a list for my own use, and at last count it was over 60.

As mentioned by some people, a pose may appear in more than one workout, but it does not happen that often.  (Routines in yoga will often have a relaxation pose at the end.)  Beth's review set forth more on the various workouts and the poses that are done.

The segments do move smootlhy between sections and flows like an actual class in moving between poses, a few seconds to transition to the next pose, but you can pause things if you need more time.

They do get easier as you do them more often, but you should be warned that this will NOT be easy for the first few weeks.  I was already pretty flexible, active and not obese, and I had a difficult time holding many of the poses.  And many of them are just plain uncomfortable.

2654836,5,B000ICLRKW,"I've done yoga for over 17 years, and I was looking for yoga that focuses more on breathing and stillness, rather than an athletic, muscle-building workout. This fits the bill perfectly. Many (most?) of the poses are done in a seated or reclined position, and most benefit from using props (blanket, strap, cushions or blocks). Poses are held for a relatively long time and are not strenuous if supported properly. Unlike many ""yin yoga"" routines, I've never hurt myself by over-stretching on this DVD. And it's one of the few DVDs I've owned that has zero sun salutations. :)

I think the setup of the DVD is brilliant - each pose is filmed individually, then different series of poses are strung together to make a 15- to 60-minute series focused on a particular theme. It is NOT a smooth vinyasa, flowing from pose to pose, so if that's what you want, look elsewhere. However, I found it very simple to finish one pose and move to the next.

Overall, I would say: know what you want from your yoga. If you want weight loss, cardio, or strength training, look elsewhere (anything with ""power,"" ""ashtanga,"" ""weight loss,"" etc. in the title). I would also suggest beginners start elsewhere (preferably with a good teacher). However, if you want to slow down from a too-busy life, I recommend this DVD highly.",1375228800,,1308,4.732456140350878

Maybe it's me because I also do kettlebell and have never been bored.  That's at a pace a can do and like.
But let's just say this was not my style.  And I didn't keep the DVD it found a new home in the trash.",1374364800,,410,3.776470588235294

I remember dismissing previous reviews that mentioned the lack of flow of the routines, and I wish I had listened. What I love most about yoga is the flow, and the CD moves from standing to sitting poses with no connection.

It features several short routines to choose from that target certain areas of the body that hold tension.  My favorite routine is the one for upper back and neck tension.  You can either do the 20 minute segment or the 30.  Anyone can do these routines.  The stretches are easy, you move at a slow pace, see a beautiful ocean background and hear gentle music while you are working out.",1357430400,,472,4.559523809523809

I have never done yoga before but I was desperate for something that would help me relax and sleep at night. This dvd is great. After just a week of doing it, I noticed that I was sleeping better and longer. My favorite program is the beginning and ending your day. It helps to relax me and release tension. It took some getting used to the voice of the narrator, but it doesn't bother me now. If you have problems with sleeping, tension headaches or anything stress related, I think this dvd will help you.",1353801600,,608,4.25

It is easy to follow.
Requires minimal equipment and floor space.
Improves flexibility and reduces tight/sore muscles.
Great for stress reduction that is tied in with muscle pain.

Cons: Some of the movements are repeated in the chapters.
If you are truly wound up, you may not be able to slow down and experience the unwinding.
This is not for muscle toning (not really a con, though--just an observation!)",1351728000,,518,4.954022988505747

This is what this DVD does, it takes you back from whatever hectic life you have - to basics.  I like the ocean view and sound and find it a plus that the instrutor dresses in light blue, as well... her voice is so sooothing (she does not talk during the practice), instead her voice is in the background...another PLUS for me.  Like other reviewer stated, there are many sessions to choose from. I do not suffer from insomnia, but still enjoy the session practice focused on these issues, and I have fallen asleep in the last 5 minutes of it.  Even my two-month kitten falls asleep on my stomach while I lay there...  By the way I bought this DVD because I was working toooo much and began having anxiety attacks, went to the doctor and she prescribed anti-depressants... I said ok thank you, but tossed the prescription and decided to slow down, work less, laugh more, and just relax and breath!!!",1351209600,4,997,4.486187845303867

I can understand some coaching, but she never stops talking.  She talks continuously, not quite sure why they even bothered with some music and the sounds from the ocean..you can't really relax and enjoy those sounds.  Probably would have been an excellent DVD had the voice-over, loud, constant talking not completely ruined it for me.  I also didn't like the way the sets are broken up into segments.  Yoga should be flowing.  Lastly, routines are repeated under different categories...there are enough yoga poses to have uniqueness within each category.  Definitely not for me.",1350432000,,749,5.032520325203252

2654867,5,B000ICLRKW,"Yoga for Stress Relief with Barbara Benagh is not an exercise routine.  As the title implies, this DVD is not for those who wish to gain strength or trim their bodies.  Barbara Benagh leads restorative yoga routines intended to relieve tense muscles or pain.  The categories addressed are relaxation, neck and shoulder pain, low back pain, stomach and digestive issues, insomnia, depression, and meditation.

The presentation takes some time to get used to as Ms. Benagh demonstrates one pose, then it fades to black and the next pose opens.  I found this style of presentation choppy and uneven at first but now I've grown used to it.  I've come to appreciate this DVD for what it is, stress relief and relaxation rather than exercise.  I have found regular use of the poses for the hip and SI joint have reduced my pain from sciatica.  I have also found the routine for insomnia to be very helpful.

Barbara Benagh uses voice over to narrate the poses; she has a soft and gentle voice and gives excellent instruction and cueing for alignment and form.  This has become one of my favorite DVDs, but I usually chose to do a routine in the evening, right before bed.",1339200000,2,1165,4.666666666666667
2654868,5,B000ICLRKW,"The title of the video is really what it is all about.  It is using yoga for stress relief.

There is alot of variety on the video.  Beginning and Ending Your Day (which are relaxing and energizing), Neck, Shoulder, and Back Issues, Easing Your Mind, Stomach and Digestion.  Though some routines do involve lying down in who or in part, it is due to making you relax and breath.  But there is more than just lying there - the Beginning and Ending the Day, for instance, has standing poses, sun salutations and more mixed in.  There are also some nice sitting poses and other things to do.

If any of the selections are what you like to work on (Dr. Beth gives a ice break of the things) then it is a good choice for you, even if you need only one or two of the routines, though the beginning and ending the day, plus easing your i, work well for pretty much anyone who wants to relax.  (It is not a workout dvd, though you are doing exercises.  If you need a workout yoga video, and do not need to address the issues or just have some calming things to work with, you probably want to consider other things.

However, if you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of life -- and release your stress in a soothing way, this type of yoga is for you. It focuses on slowing down, breathing deeply, and gently surrendering into poses. This DVD is a great value (you probably could not find a yoga class for less than $10) -- and there are about 20 workouts of varying time segments (ranging from 15-60 minutes). It's also gratifying to practice yoga with a seasoned instructor who understands yoga's restoratives effects. I have a variety of yoga DVDs (ranging from Ivengar, Bikram, and Kundalini styles) - and I do them all, depending on my mood and wellness goals for the day.

I understand that it's for stress relief, but I might as well do a few downward dogs, some static stretching, go lie down in bed, and save myself $10. I don't need a DVD to show me to do that. I was looking for something to help me wind down my Type A personality before bed at night while also providing me with some active stretching exercises to ease my tight muscles and aid in recovery from all of my triathlon training. Stress management in my opinion is not lying there in peace, but rather actively doing something to release the stress and the tension. A typical yoga DVD requires some work on your part by engaging muscles, and can alleviate stress, but still feel like a workout. If you're looking for something a little lighter than that, DON'T buy this DVD.....look for a stretching DVD or something.

Overall this is a nice addition to a yoga practice and is exactly what it says it is in terms of handling stress.

1)  HUGE selection with great descriptions.... The sessions are described for example 'insomnia', 'stress relief', 'constipation', 'neck and back' etc....
2) The voice is very good meditative quality
3) She holds the poses nice amount of time - not feeling rushed - as I so often feel with other videos.
4) She really puts emphasis on the breathe - something that I find lacking in other videos also.

Has totally helped me w/ stress, insomnia, headaches etc.  It actually is very very similar to a class I take locally so it is great to have the video at home when I can not make it to class.

2654889,4,B000ICLRKW,"I HATE yoga.  I love Pilates.

But, yoga is known for it's calming abilities and whatnot.

In late 2010 I was told by my physician that a lot of my health issues were due to high stress/anxiety.  I needed to calm down, chill out.  He, and many others, suggested yoga as a means of supplementing exercise.

Thank God this is not meant for exercise because, in truth, even the true yoga classes would scoff at this video.  In all honesty, if you're looking for a DVD on stress relief provided by yoga - you're probably going to be hard pressed to find one that is both good exercise and good for the soul.

You will need a good amount of cushioning for this DVD.  Pillows, blankets and whatnot.  I made due with what we had available in the living room.  A few throw blankets folded to my liking.  Once you get used to it, you'll just have them ready on stand-by before you begin your DVD.

Does it help?  Probably.  Momentarily at least.  I have high anxiety, so by the next day I'm already anxious again and should probably throw this DVD in the player and put up with the annoyingness of it (I really do dislike yoga).

Memorizing some of these has helped me when I am not near a TV.  Instead, I can find myself some seclusion and practice the breathing (that is what helps the most) and the positions of relaxation.

All in all, yes, it works.  I had issues with breathing and fast heart rate and this is truly the only DVD/technique I've come to that actually has slowed my heart rate and returned my breathing to normal.",1319241600,3,1524,4.336879432624113

2654900,5,B000ICLRKW,"Yoga for Stress Relief is a DVD of yoga routines designed to address particular symptoms related to stress. The DVD is divided into four sections: Beginning & Ending Your Day, Neck, Shoulder, & Back Issues, Easing Your Mind, and Stomach & Digestion Issues. Many of the routines are geared to specific stress related symptoms like tension headaches, insomnia, neck pain, back pain and breathing. There's even one called ""Mood Uplift"" for when you just feel a little less than enthused. In all, there are twenty routines of varying intensity and length leaving one little to no excuse for skipping a workout. The length of each routine is clearly noted on the menu, so one knows exactly how long the routine will take. The poses in all the routines are clearly demonstrated and described in a calm, soothing voice. Some props are required to do the poses correctly. The routines contain many of the same elements combined in different sequences allowing the body and the mind to find familiarity and newness in each routine. The DVD is great for beginners and intermediate levels but likely wouldn't be enough challenge for someone who is advanced in practicing yoga. This is a yoga DVD one can turn to repeatedly to deal with the stress of daily life. I know I do.",1313107200,2,1263,4.798165137614679

It has helped alot and there is alot of different moves on this DVD.  Though some things are used in more than one routine, it is not that often and looking at some of the more detailed reviews gave me the information I needed.  There is easily hours of different material on this video and it is easy to see

The moves last from generally 5 to 10 minutes in the routine before the next one is used so it was fine in how these were put together.  The interview was great to tell you all about things.",1312934400,,650,4.007751937984496

This is not a DVD to try for a ""workout""; If you're looking to sweat, try Biggest Loser Yoga, MTV Power Yoga, or any other ashtanga-based DVD. This DVD contains a variety of routines ranging from 15 minutes to 50 minutes for different ailments, from neck pain to indigestion, to anxiety. Each routine is a mix of several different series, which are reused throughout the DVD. Because of this segmenting, the routines don't flow great, but the variety of routines makes it worth it. Most of the routines I've done are best suited for the evening, and I did fall asleep once during the 20-minute ""deep rest"" routine. She relies heavily on props, but also explains how to do the poses without them. I've never been a big fan of props, but it does seem to make many of the poses more relaxing and maybe even more effective.",1312588800,5,963,4.540229885057471

I feel less tension in my neck and shoulders and it has carried through.

The instruction is clear and she has a warm personality which helps relax me.  All in all a very wortwhile purchase.  Even if there is only one thing on here that you need help with, it is worth the cost to feel better.",1311638400,,441,4.265060240963855

It seems like every segment whether for back,stomach,relaxation,etc, were all the same.  It honestly doesn't involve all that many yoga poses.  It involves more laying and meditating than any yoga dvd I have tried so far.  And it requires such things as 3 blankets, chairs, walls, etc.. So if you are looking to learn meditation this is good but if you are looking to learn yoga I'd buy beginners yoga by Yogaworks instead.",1310947200,2,516,4.764044943820225
2654907,5,B000ICLRKW,"This stress relief DVD was incredibly effective in clearing up severe tension in my back. I was nearly incapacitated from upper back pain and was on the verge of making the rounds to doctors, chiropractors, and massage therapists for relief. I was miserable. Out of desperation I put on this DVD and did a series of Barbara's relaxing routines - about 1.5 hours worth - and I was COMPLETELY relieved of the pain. I have continued to do 30-60 minutes of these routines daily for the last several weeks and have not had a recurrence of the pain. I can honestly say this DVD has enhanced my life and taught me so much.

The DVD is appropriate for near beginners, but also can be modified for more experienced yogis. The value of restorative yoga was first presented to me in Timothy McCall's book, Yoga as Medicine, another excellent source of information. Barbara is thorough in her description of the poses, and sprinkles a good bit of her yoga wisdom throughout the DVD. She is a very insightful teacher and I am so thankful she has put this experience on a DVD and made it available to everyone. Thanks Barbara!",1310256000,4,1112,4.5879396984924625

As much as I respect the Dalai lama,  I did not get all the advice on meditation, despite increasing the volume and rewinding for the bits I missed. Poor audio quality combined with dialect problems.  I bought this DVD because I have IBS and a hormone imbalance with gives me backaches and really stiff muscles. Holding the lying down poses made the aches worse. I was looking for gentle yoga with flowing poses done at my own pace and this was not quite it. I have tried this DVD thrice(with blankets and bolsters to help my sore muscles) with no positive effects noticed.  Will not be using this.

2654912,5,B000ICLRKW,I have been using this DVD for over a year now and find that I can't go more than a day without doing at least one segment.  It is addictive - you get started and you want to keep going.  You learn which routines and specific exercises your body needs and it is easy to find the ones you want to do to customize your own routine for the day.  I've also purchased other DVDs by the same instructor now and so far they are all fabulous.  Great support for an at home yoga practice - the instructor demonstrates great form.,1302998400,4,520,4.118811881188119

It seemed to be perfect to address some things that bothered me from time to time.

It has been very good in helping me relax and help reduce my headaches and backaches in a nicely targeted way of focusing on issues.  The general catagories are morning and evening exercises, necj shoulder and back exercises, relaxtion/easing your mind and stomach issues.  I have a couple of favorites that I find myself doing 3-5 times a week since they have worked so well.",1302912000,,700,4.4453125
2654914,3,B000ICLRKW,"At first I thought it was okay, then I thought it had major problems and wanted to give it 1 star for disappointment: little flow (choppy with a few poses then fade out, then fade in a 1-5 or so more poses before fading again).  During the fading in, you don't know if she'll be in the same position or not (ie lying down, sitting, standing).  Also, at first the stretches seemed easy or impossible (imagine a chubby person with short arms trying to clasp hands behind her back and lift the clasped hands up a foot) but with very little benefit.  I thought the stretches were ineffective.  What they are is gentle stretches and their benefits improve with practice.  That is how I learned the poses with her too, as I went, because some of her follow through directions are incomprehensible (""pull your side ribs forward""?, those are bones) but mostly are okay.  At the end, I feel more relaxed with some minor stretching benefits.

That is not enough if I need to loosen up after lifting weights or because I have a perpetual crick in my neck (even with the rolled up hand towel under my neck at night).  The stretches are gentle, her voice is soothing and overall, it's a nice DVD.  However, the language is sometimes confusing, the flow is lost with the choppy format and the stretches leave a bit to be desired.

I would recommend this to people looking for what the title claims it is for; relaxation and stress relief, along with gentle, extremely slow stretching, for the novice.  Also, expect (probably with any instructor and new positions) the poses/stretches to become more effective as you become accustomed to and practice them.  That's what I learned.

Although I am a novice, I want a bit more for my buck--more flow, more stretch, clearer language and a bit more energy.  Until night, when I may go back to this one for relaxation and minor stretching.",1302912000,,1868,4.604229607250756

2654917,5,B000ICLRKW,"I am a college student. I bought this dvd about a month and a half ago, having no prior exposure to yoga, and have been using it about 3-5 times a week since. The routines do vary in length, and there are many to choose from so the workout you receive is rather customizable. The routines are a bit choppy--when you start you may do a sitting pose and then it will fade to black and have you start the next stretch by standing, but it is not so bothersome that I've ever had a problem switching from one pose to the next. I've not had any practice with yoga before buying this dvd and I can do all of the poses without much trouble.

As far as the stress relief goes, yes the routines tend to either be very relaxing or very absorbing, they do demand your attention and heavily focus on breathing and stretching. It does help stress and anxiety by making you focus on the routine and let go of every thing else. I'm definitely not going to say that it's cured my anxiety after just a month, but I do believe it is helping. Very often I feel more energized and happier after doing a couple routines.

This is a second title I have from Barbara and it is very good in helping target particular problem areas that can cause you pain, headaches or backaches for example, or other things that throw you off from stress, such as not sleeping well for example.

As others noted, it is not a workout video (though it does make you feel better) it is more restorative and helpful.

As my old stressors disappeared new ones took their place and I remembered my old friend Barbara Benagh and found my ""Yoga for Stress Relief.""  Only 3 weeks in and I am stronger and more flexible again already, and much more at peace.  I have had chronic shoulder problems since a bad reaction to a flu shot a couple of years ago and amazingly the shoulder and neck work part of the DVD is helping ALOT!  Thank you again!",1287792000,,620,4.310344827586207
2654944,5,B000ICLRKW,"I was looking for a yoga routine(s) that were fufilling for the results and flexiable to my non stop schedule. I purchased 3 yoga dvds led by Barbara Benagh and they are all very well done. I especially connected with yoga for stress relief. It gives you more then you expect when it states pick your level and choose your time and the selection of specific routines for individual areas of the body or situations you want to work on is just wonderful. The movements are not overly physical and could be enjoyed by many and more adding the modifications that are included. For such simple routines, and simple movements I am always suprised at the end of a session how deep and uplifting the experience is for your total body and inner wellness. I'm currently doing the Easing Your Mind section, the 15 minute breathing  when I first roll out of bed, and then Serenity in Stillness 30 minutes right before I go to bed, amazing for how easily my body and mind connects. Easy to fit into my schedule so I can do it every day. I found all of this series to be very pleasent .",1286323200,,1072,4.386934673366834
2654945,4,B000ICLRKW,"I'm glad I had the patience to keep trying this dvd. At first, thinking it was a regular yoga dvd, I was very disappointed. I constantly came away feeling like I hadn't done yoga at all, because most of my muscles hadn't been stretched in the way I was used to.

But one day when I was very sick with nausea and body aches, I tried a routine from the Stomach & Digestive series. And this dvd saved my life. This teacher hits just the right spots to settle things down and relax the whole body when it is in trauma. Same when I tried a routine from her Headache series -- it really relieved the pressure in my head and helped my whole body relax.

So the routines in Yoga for Stress Relief might best be reserved for those moments when you're really not feeling well. If you just need to unwind in general, even after a really bad day, I highly recommend Yoga for Every Body and Yoga for Inflexible People, both by the same company that produces Stress Relief. If I am feeling unwell, I sometimes start with a Stress Relief segment, then switch to one of the other dvd's for a quick general stretching routine.

P.S. Although I'm not a Buddhist, I really enjoyed the Dalai Lama's talk on meditation at the beginning of this dvd. I do recommend watching it.",1285977600,10,1255,4.3319148936170215

2654947,1,B000ICLRKW,"THis is the slowest and worst yoga dvd I have ever owned. We have a full collection and this is for the geriatric crowd. Or my DVD player was broken. Do not bother. Also, audio on on speak very poor.",1284249600,2,199,4.0
2654948,5,B000ICLRKW,"A few years ago I developed severe anxiety and panic symptoms that nearly led to a home-bound case of agoraphobia. On the verge of losing my job and desperate for a cure I stumbled across this on Amazon and decided that at the price it was worth a shot. Within days of starting these routines my symptoms were drastically reduced, eventually to the point that I was able to handle my disorder without the use of medication. (This is in no way to discount the role of psychiatry/psychology in treating this disorder, I believe they are an integral part of overcoming it, but this DVD truly changed the course my life was on.) The breathing exercises help to retrain your breathing pattern, which in states of panic and anxiety are altered, and can be implemented quietly during your day to day life without drawing attention to yourself. I have even used them in business meetings and nobody has seemed to notice.

I have also battled insomnia. In my case it was simply not being able to 'turn my mind off' at night. Again, the insomnia portion of this DVD has been able to do what before only potentially addictive medicines had done for me, calm my mind to the point of sleep.

I can't recommend this DVD enough. Thanks to Barbara for putting together such an invaluable tool for anyone suffering from stress related issues.",1282953600,17,1325,4.634042553191489

But it is also really good with helping with other things and someone who really knows yoga can put things together in a way to help with various health issues - some things have been found to help people with headaches or sleep better.

This is what this DVD does, helps relieve stress that manifests itself various ways, insomnia, headaches, lower back pain and other items which have been mentioned.

2654954,5,B000ICLRKW,"I love intense exercise, but I also love this DVD.  I would categorize it as very gentle yoga, almost more like breath work and meditation more than yoga.  This DVD is the perfect workout when I've had a very stressful day and I want to unwind.  It's also my `go to' workout when I'm injured. There are 4 main categories: Beginning/Ending Your Day, Neck, Shoulder and Back Issues, Easing Your Mind, and Digestion Issues.  With several routines in each category, you have over 20 workout routines.

I didn't mind the slow pace and appreciated seeing Barbara fold the blanket or get out the other props, since that meant I didn't have to rush to do the same thing before starting the next move.

Whenever I do this work out, I have a great night's sleep.  There is something about Barbara's soothing voice, the beautiful beach scenery and the focus on breathing that really de-stresses me.

My two minor issues with this DVD:

**the workout times aren't accurate.
**it would be nice to have chapters, instead of all preset workouts.

These issues don't detract from my enjoyment of this DVD.

This workout is suitable for all fitness levels.  It's great for stress relief.",1278633600,,1170,4.737623762376238

The segments are just cut and paste, which is why the ""flow"" is disjointed. I wish I paid more attention to the negative review. This is NOTHING like real yoga! It's just breathing and holding poses.

2654956,5,B000ICLRKW,"I had hurt my back awhile ago and nothing really helped with the pain much. I tried some regular physio, and it helped a little bit, but then I was told to try some yoga and this DVD since it helped my friend with her headaches.

So I gave it a chance now for about two months and it has been a godsend. The yoga is gentle and well presented by the instructor and has helped to loosen up the tension I had in my back which seemed to be the main source of why I hurt.  The routines are well done and flow well with the sections of poses that move from one to the next and gently warm you up as you progress.

I have used some of the other sections now, particularly the ones for energy, and they are very good also.

My thanks go to the teacher for what she has done on this...",1277424000,,776,3.892405063291139

I have a job that requires me to be on my feet alot, so my legs and lower back often tense up and I also find myself rolling my shoulders, which has given me headaches.

The yoga has helped me carry less pain and I have found my posture improving also.  As someone who has spent alot of time teaching, I really appreciate how she was able to convey the instruction.  She was able to get the ideas and benefits across very well.

So this one is good to teach yoga and feel better.",1276473600,,618,4.074380165289257
2654958,1,B000ICLRKW,"I am sorry I bought this dvd. I began having back muscle spasms about 2 months ago. A massage therapist suggested I try yoga and stretching exercises, so I bought this dvd (being somewhat of a beginner, it sounded perfect.) I did all the sections on relieving tension & concerning back and neck issues, plus mixing in a few other sections, everyday for 3 weeks. It never helped at all, and I found them terribly tedious and boring, while the constant spasms became excruciating at times.

Finally I gave up on this and went to the library and got an armful of books on yoga. I learned so much more, tried all kinds of postures and flow movements for the back, neck and shoulders, figured out what felt good, and gradually my spasms got better. (I also cut back on some some daily stressors, and I still have a way to go.). It was surprising to me that Benagh left out so many traditional and potentially helpful postures. If I had stopped with this dvd, it would have turned me against Yoga altogether.",1276473600,6,1002,4.475409836065574
2654959,4,B000ICLRKW,"Some reviewers already went through an entire description of the DVD. I don't have anything to add to it. This was my second yoga DVD after the Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies. I'm totally new to yoga, and by far out of shape, so consider my review from a beginner's point of view. I understand Barbara Benagh is a great yoga master. I must say that the postures are accessible to anyone, which is perfect. You do not need to have specific alignment of poses skills to follow the class. Plus, she is the kind of teacher who will pass on her energy through the DVD. Just keep in mind that this was not designed to develop your core stability, flexibility and strength. It's developed to increase your ability to get to peace of mind. I think of it as a restorative kind of yoga and I use it in addition to other routines or occasionally, when needed. I rather achieved some sort of profound peace of mind and relaxation. Somewhat different from my first DVD that took my body and mind to a great energizing workout, by managing the relationship of movement and breathe, and helped me reach a deep state of relaxation, breathe fully and stretch my body full force. I have done the ""Yoga for Stress Relief"" routine when stressed out and it truly allowed my physical body to align with the emotional and mental bodies. I was then able to manage my resources and free my mind in order to navigate the nervous tension out of me in a serene and tension free body and mind. I give it 4 stars because it doesn't increase strength and suppleness even though Barbara shows she is extremely flexible. It would probably help release more stress if you could bend yourself beyond your limits during the posture. I am willing to upgrade my condition but usually it doesn't do me any good to reach further than my comfort zone and go into pain. Therefore, I have to hit for another yoga routine in order to progress and increase my core strengthening and flexibility gradually. I am sure it will multiply the relief of this routine. But still, you can make this DVD works for you, no matter if you were keen on looking at yoga art deeper; it's worth having it in your collection.",1275350400,,2162,4.4759493670886075
2654960,4,B000ICLRKW,I was about to get married when I bought this. I think it helped me a lot as everybody on my D-day said that I was the most relaxed looking bride they have ever seen.

2654961,5,B000ICLRKW,"I have practiced different yoga styles for several years. I recently started back with yoga after a few years away and many changes in my life. I am just in love with this DVD and I wish I lived where Barbara teaches. She is one of the best instructors I have ever found.

This lady understands yoga and how to guide you through it. The instruction is clear and easy to follow. The routines work for what they say they will. If you want to do yoga to help with tension related aches and pains, sleep issues or just general relaxation, I would recommend that you get this DVD",1274832000,,574,4.26605504587156
2654962,5,B000ICLRKW,"My massage therapist suggested I try some yoga.  She's been doing it or years and swears by it.  After trying a bunch of different kinds of yoga and getting different DVDs, this is the one that I've stuck with.

I needed something to loosen me up, get me more relaxed and just feeling and functioning better.  There is lots to choose from for routines and something for every kind of issue or symptom you have from stress and just being overworked.  This isn't the kind of yoga that is going to be part of your workout, it's more the kind of yoga that you'll want to do instead of taking something for your headache after a really hard day.",1273622400,,640,4.34453781512605
2654963,4,B000ICLRKW,"I was surprised to read the ""most helpful critical review"" and other negative reviews criticizing the DVD, questioning the pace and use of props.  The purpose of gentle and restorative yoga (for pain or stress) is for people that need focus on relaxing their muscles, body, and mind.  A slower pace is expected and desired by individuals who are specifically seeking this kind of yoga.  Also, the props are hugely instrumental for providing additional support who need it.  If you prefer a faster pace instruction than gentle and restorative yoga is not for you.  If you're partial to live instruction then you should go to a class.  For example, I utilize DVDs since I don't want to plan around class schedules but rather when it's the right time for me.

I got the Yoga for Stress Relief DVD as part of my search for gental yoga DVDs.  As there weren't many options, I figured a yoga DVD on stress relief will focus using the same approach as gental yoga.  It works well since stress relief yoga and gentle yoga both help pain and strain due to tight muscles, such as neck, shoulders, hips, etc.

As someone with chronic upper and lower back problems due to injuries, the poses definitely provided relief.  I also liked how the menu offers a variety of choices, with short and long sessions as well as passive and active poses.  It's helpful since you can choose what you need, depending on you're feeling physcially that day.  The sessions also emphasize meditative breathing to the poses, which is a fantastic reminder when you're in a pose to help relax into it further.

The only thing that could be better is the camera stays in one position the whole time and doesn't show different angles of the poses, which can be a problem if it's a new pose for you and you want to make sure you're doing it correctly.  The other problem was that changes between poses don't allow for time for the viewer to make the changes.  For example, they show one pose with sitting, and then they cut to the next pose with the person already standing or lying down.  So you have to pause the DVD and change your pose.  Something you don't want to worry about when you're trying to relax and be present with your practice.

All in all, it's one of the better DVDs I've tried.",1273017600,2,2260,4.5358024691358025
2654964,3,B000ICLRKW,"To be most helpful, I'd suggest reading the most popular reviews here on Amazon to get the exact listing of this DVD's contents (20 routines).  I was looking for a beginner's Yoga DVD and this is most definitely a beginners DVD.  Although the exercises were relaxing, they seemed awfully long to me.  None were particularly complicated or challenging and I found myself bored several times.  Breathing and mind-relaxing is definitely one of the most important aspects depicted on this DVD, but nothing more challenging.

I was able to glean a few Yoga techniques to help relax, but not much more.  I would have liked to see more stretching exercises.  Instructor Barbara Benagh is perfect for demonstration techniques and the overdubs were relaxing with a great ocean/beach background.  The biggest lesson I learned was that one needs to slow down and take the time to do even the simplest techniques.

The 30-minute segment with the Dalai Lama was interesting at first, but the audio (or my poor listening to dialects) was distracting.  I respect the Dalai Lama but felt that this segment was extraneous - more of a filler.  I would not dismiss this DVD for anyone, however I just didn't connect with it.  The next thing I am going to do is enroll in an actual class where I can concentrate completely with an actual person.",1272931200,4,1325,4.814159292035399

2654966,2,B000ICLRKW,"I love yoga and have many, many yoga DVDs.  This one I've given away because of two major flaws:

1.  The first flaw is that the routines are not, in fact, routines - they are little individual segments that have been pasted together.  This creates two problems; the first is that the segments often do not flow together so the feeling created is that the routine is totally disjointed.  The second problem is that we now see the same little segment multiple times throughout the DVD, just cut and pasted in.

2.  The second major flaw is the repetitious folding of blankets, etc.  The first time it is watched we may want to see how to fold or place it, but after the 10th time and our blankets are at hand, spending 45 seconds watching her fold and place the blankets (multiple times throughout multiple routines no less) the flow and pace and thus the purpose and outcome of the yoga routine is disrupted.  How about a little button to click on for first time users that says 'how to fold a blanket' next time?

Also, I was anticipating a yoga tape with moves that flowed from one into the other; this tape is a series of instructions in each segment that teaches one stretch at a time.  When instruction for that one is completed, the scene fades out and an entire new movement begins.

The lower back and hip routine was a great addition for me to add for extra work on those areas for me, and the restorative/relaxtion nature of this DVD has been very nice addition.

I have been pleasantly suprised how effective the routines are for what they say they are for.  For instance, the headache routine really works well, and I do that one once or twice a week and it has worked in cutting down my headaches and the severity on the times they do happen, and that is only doing that for about 6 weeks I would guess.

It is generally designed to help with certain specific physical conditions that affect you, such as headaches, and also includes other more general things to work with. Even if you do not have a physical problem, the routines such as easing tension in the shoulders work well for days when you feel tight.

The items are paced well and Barbara carefully leads you through things. Very calm and soothing and her outlook on yoga and stress is a good one to learn from. I am still relatively new to yoga, and this really can be done by anyone.

It has things for energizing & relaxing from the day, neck/back/shoulders, general mental relaxtion and stomach issues.

Easing Your Mind - 5 general relaxing sessions.

Stomach and Digestion Issues - 4 routines to work on digestion.

I regularly do the morning hour as it covers most things and have found the sections helping each part of the body invaluable to help with the stresses and strains we all get especially the lower back - brilliant! I bought it partly because of the intro from the dalai lama and have also been impressed by her meditation at the end of the sections.,1240185600,,555,4.235849056603773

I have to say that I had no expectations and bought a few DVDs he suggested just to keep the family peace.  I started with the Beginner DVD by the same instructor to get familiar with yoga and see what I thought. I liked it and moved on to the Stress Relief program.

This DVD is great.  The routines are well thought and will help you with whatever issue they are for.  This program is for working out specific muscle and system issues.

It doesn't specify a specific experience level and I felt it is designed for people of all levels. Really experienced people should enjoy the routines for what they are designed for.",1238457600,,783,4.395833333333333

My back was often sore enough to the point it would often interfere with a good night's rest.

I have been working with the lower back and hip routines for about two months and it has really helped.  The shoulder routines have also been helpful, I find myself hunching over less.

I will be honest that I have not tried every routine yet; this is because the first few that I tried consisted mostly of lying on your back on the mat... which I did not find very exerting. I was disappointed by this, so I have not used it as much as I might have otherwise.

Gradually, over the last two months the pain is subsiding and I'm able to perform my daily tasks with much less suffering. I'm forever in debth to her. The sequences are done slowing so we can enjoy the practice fully and all of them consist in very good options for the daily practice.

I love that the DVD is split up into different chapters and you can choose which one to do according to your needs.  Some days I need a relaxing segment while another day I need a segment to help with digestion or insomnia.  At first I thought each pose lingered too long but now I see that you need that long to truly release the tension.  I would highly recommend if you need something relaxing and soothing.

I picked this DVD because it had a section just for that purpose.  The ""ease your mind"" list was also appealing.  The routines are effective and they do what they say they will.

While it is wonderful to have such a wide array of choices for each yoga session, I found it strange that each yoga pose is a separate piece.  There's a delay between each pose...they don't flow from one to the other.  I guess this helps the makers of the dvd customize each segment but it's not really conducive to a yoga session.  Also, some of the poses seem very basic and then suddenly the instructor is working at a very high level and twisting her arm around to the other waist from the back.

She's on the beach and the waves are crashing and there's birds tweeting. It just relaxes you to watch this. She is a wonderful instructor and talks you through all the moves and offers modified versions in case you have a weak back or knees, etc. There is so much you can do on this dvd. The list goes on and on. There's stuff you can do for 15 minutes if that's all you have or you can do as much as you can like me. I feel so centered and peaceful when I work with this dvd.

These routines alone have made the DVD worthwhile and the instructor is good like on her other DVD I have.

Barbara Benagh is a very relaxing instructor with a convincing and kind voice. I find the passive upper back and neck very helpful as I often ache there after a day hunched over the computer. The insomnia and the letting go of the day routines are amazingly relaxing. Actually I like all the shorter routines.
I own a lot of yoga DVDs and I practice four or five days a week, usually from a half hour to an hour, usually Rodney Yee or that wonderful Ali McGraw DVD (Eric Schiffman teaches) Sometimes I do the long AM yoga session on this DVD. (For this I take her instructions to move the shoulder back in one of the twists  with a grain of salt as this is one way I can hurt my stiff shoulders. I find it better to concentrate on the twisiting of the torso and take the shoulder and arm back very gently.

After doing it 3 times a week for about 2 weeks, I am noticeably more flexible through the hamstrings, and always feel great after doing even a short ""workout"" from this DVD.

I can understand why yoga instructors choose this format, but I guess I'm partial to live instruction. Perhaps I would have found the voiceover narration more tolerable had this dvd been setup differently. A mix-n-match option sounds like a potentially great idea, but the routines on this dvd are choppy and repetitive. My biggest complaint is the constant use of props. I bought this dvd to relax and relieve stress. I did not buy this dvd to fold towels in thirds.. place pillows here and there.. etc...

I haven't tried the morning or evening practices, just the ones for specific ailments.  I can see how this might be helpful...it helped my tension headache temporarily.  But it seems like this DVD may have been made for older adults or for those simply looking to use yoga to help with certain issues.  Not for people who are looking for a regular yoga practice.  I will still probably pull this out when I have a specific issue, but won't use it otherwise.  It's pretty slow.  She pretty much just holds poses for lengthy amounts of time, and a lot of these aren't your typical yoga poses.  This felt more like stretching and conscious relaxation than yoga.

2655064,5,B000ICLRKW,"A few days ago I got my DVD order for Barbara Benagh: Yoga for Stress Relief.

The DVD shows the same lovely beach in Half Moon Bay as in her Beginners Yoga DVD, but in this one, there is also very soft, gentle guitar in the background. You can barely hear it and it does not drown out the sound of the waves. So that is nicely done.

Barbara also has a rather longish interview where she talks about modern life being overloaded, and how yoga will help slow things down. And about how hard it is to slow down at first. Tell me about it! :)

The interview on meditation by the Dalai Lama contains great information and HH's soft, gentle humor. It is hard at times to understand what he is saying and one requires a slight bit of patience to understand some of this section.

This DVD has such a wealth of options in it, and all for helping with mental and physical conditions: headaches, shoulder/neck tension, opening your heart, digestive ailments, lower back pain, hip pain, anxiety, some AM and PM routines, an insomnia set, mood uplift, serenity work...

So far I tried these sections:

Easing Neck Tension, passive variation (20 mins) - Soft Spanish guitar music, everything lying down, mainly body twisting. Very sweet and restful.

Restorative Poses for Relaxation (15 mins) - soft new Agey music, three supportive poses: cobblers, heart opener and legs up the wall. Pretty much the same set as on Barbara's Yoga for Beginners DVD (the rejuvenate one) but without the centering/breathing part. Also, this one suggests more uses of the blankets and having an eye bag. As I got an eye bag as a gift, I was prepared. But you only really need three blankets/pillows for this section.

Lower Back Tension (35 min): This was the best one yet. With my period cramps it was incredibly soothing to my lower back/stomach area. We used a blanket, strap and eye pillow for this set. A bit more active than the two I tried above, this has locus pose and a great let stretch with the strap.

Hip Pain section(35 min): Essentially the same routine as the Lower Back Tension, but with two changes. One was the reclined half lotus and the other was something where you sit on your knees, then spread the hips wide, and lean your head forward to the floor. These were very nice poses for my menstrual cramping and this session took away the lingering pain I had.

Other than that, the footage is just sliced from the back pain one, with the same modified down dog, locust, hamstring stretch with strap.

We used a strap, and eye bag in this one, but no blanket was needed.

New Agey music, very gentle, as in the back pain one. You can still hear the ocean and even some birds.

Serenity in Stillness (35 min) - lovely section that really opens the sacrum and relaxes the entire body. There was quite a bit of repeats from the back pain and hip pain segments, including the reclining half lotus, but it all came together well. The supported backbend at the end requires a yoga brick. I really enjoyed this pose. New Agey music with a vaguely Hawaiian theme.

So many choices in this great DVD - it will be hard to get to them all! It's all all presented in a lovely beach setting and accompanied by Barbara's soothing, healing voice.

Highly recommended for yoga practitioners to use (as needed) for various physical/mental ailments. There are also a few AM/PM type routines in this disc, as a bonus for anyone wishing to add this DVD to their regular yoga rotation.",1213574400,9,3456,4.542673107890499

My tension headaches have been reduced in how often they occur and their serverity, so those exercises alone were worth it to me.

This DVD does what it says and I would recommend it highly.",1212883200,2,301,4.339285714285714
2655068,5,B000ICLRKW,"This DVD is fantastic. Barbara Benagh is a no-nonsense yoga instructor. She explains the positions in great detail. She walks you through the positions and through the routines with a soft, relaxed voice. She doesn't pressure you at all. The setting is beautiful - right on the beach in Antigua. The sound of the waves contributes to the feeling of relaxation. There are many routines to choose from, depending on your mood. I use this DVD several times a week. I highly recommend it.",1210723200,4,484,4.773809523809524

2655070,5,B000ICLRKW,"I already do a little bit of yoga, but what attracted me to this video was the mediation feature with the Dalai Lama.  Great addition.  The yoga routines for insomnia, headaches and lower back have been the best for me so far.",1210464000,3,226,4.357142857142857
2655071,5,B000ICLRKW,"The routines on the DVD are suitable for all levels.  If you have stress related issues and want to use yoga to find relief, this is a good choice.  Good instruction, very calming setting (on a nice beach), and the routines are as short as 15 minutes.",1210032000,2,251,4.319148936170213
2655072,4,B000ICLRKW,"I've never found a yoga video that I actually loved, but this one is pretty good.  The pace is good, the scenery is nice, and Barbara has a calm, soothing voice.  I did think, however, that she included some poses that were too advanced for a beginner or someone with limitations.  I would prefer the poses include modifications where possible.",1209254400,3,344,4.7
2655073,5,B000ICLRKW,"Finally, this is the Yoga DVD I've been looking for.  I'm a beginner, and I imagine that it's great for beginners and the more experienced.  This DVD gives you a LOT of Yoga for your dollar.  The running time is over 5 hours!  It's separated into 4 categories: Beginning and Ending Your Day, Neck Shoulder and Back, Easing Your Mind, and Stomach and Digestion.  Then within these categories are about 4 - 5 yoga sessions, from 10minutes to 60minutes.  For example, in the category of ""Beginning and Ending Your Day"", you see sessions for Beginning Your Day Slowly, Wake Up, Evening Revival, Letting Go of the Day, and Insomnia Issues.

The only issues I have with this DVD is that for each category, there is no introduction.  For example, I put on the session for ""Insomnia Issues"" and I was hoping for even a slight introduction that said, ""Insomnia Issues.  These poses will help you with X because X"".  There wasn't even a title screen, so when I put it on Insomnia Issues and the first thing she said was ""stand with your feet apart... this pose is good for indigestion..."", I wondered if the chapters were off.  But I felt very relaxed afterwards so I figured it was correct. Another thing - have all your blankets (to prop yourself up), blocks, a chair, straps, etc., right there at the ready.  Since there is no introduction for each session, she doesn't start off by saying, ""for this session, you'll need...."".

A very good buy, highly recommended.",1209081600,2,1458,4.6484375

I am not into the heavy duty type of yoga.  I wanted something that had variety and was easy to follow and did not incorporate complicated poses.  I chose this particular DVD because of the high reviews from Amazon.com.  I was not disappointed.  I absolutely love it.  I have told my yoga instructor about it and she had also heard about it and she was very favorable about the content in the tape and the instructor. She also mentioned that it is used to ease anxiety at our local hospital.  I am using it for the stretching exercises mainly; but, I will say that any tension I had at the beginning of a session on the DVD, at the end of the session I felt very relaxed.  I would rate this DVD very highly.  It met every expectation I had.",1204934400,5,918,4.194285714285714

He and I do it together and have a great time unwinding in each other's company.
His instructor recommended trying some yoga to help him out in his sport but my husband was worried that he would feel like a ""sissy"". This dvd was PERFECT for him. It allayed all his fears about trying yoga and doesn't feel too ""new-agey"" like some other dvd's out there.

I've always had a major problem falling to sleep - even when I'm exhausted, it can take hours.  I tried the 40 minute routine that's meant to be done to help you sleep and 20 minutes into it I was ready for bed.  I fell asleep more quickly and peacefully than I can remember.  I even set my alarm 30 minutes early to have time to do the 25-minute ""Start Your Day Slowly"" routine.  By the time I got to my 8:00 am class I felt well rested, energetic, peaceful and happy.  I can't tell you what a difference this is to my normal state of being in the morning!

2655087,5,B000ICLRKW,"I started doing some yoga a few months ago and the DVDs I have helped me gain flexibility, which has made my vacations better.  Often when I found myself walking around cities or hiking I found myself feeling sore.

I usually carry around my camera and odds and ends, and often will carry a backpack full of things to make sure I have what I need to get the proper photo and I would often feel alot of tension between the side of my neck down to my shoulders by the end of the day.

The Neck & Shoulder routines on this DVD helped reduce the amount of pain I had felt in the past and at the end of the day I would play them in my laptop to loosen up a bit.  I found myself doing the shorter routine at the end of every day and also working with the Lower Back routines.

None of the frantically energetic tone of exercise videos, none of the exotic terminology (which is often interesting, but perhaps not relaxing!?), none of the para-mystical approach. Just simple instructions in stretching, calming, and stress reduction. If that's what you want, I recommend this video highly.",1200614400,2,465,5.297297297297297

Whether you need to relax in general or if you need to help your stomach feel better it is on this DVD.

The intructor offers valuable view points and how difficult stress can be for us and it makes you feel not alone when you hear it.  Often I thought it was just me who felt that way, and knowing that it is more common than I thought makes me feel like I can get past it.",1200268800,8,537,3.81981981981982
2655090,5,B000ICLRKW,"I had purchased another DVD about 6 months ago by Barbara and loved it.  It really did start making me feel better. I spoke about it to others, and I guess my husband thought I was hinting for things for the holidays.  I had intended to purchase another of Barbara's titles, but my husband beat me to it.

So far I have not done everything on the DVD, probably about 1/2 of the routines due to the amount of material, which is extensive, and I am still working on my other DVD. Others have provided details on how many things this DVD targets and how it has helped them with various things, so I will not do that here, but the DVD  does include routines such as Insomnia Series,  Easing Neck & Shoulder Tension, Lower Back Tension, Tension Headaches, Anxiety Relief and Improve Digestion, and they deliver to help the things that their names indicate.  Even if only one routine is what you are looking at in particular, for instance you have insomnia, and did nothing else on the DVD it is a worthwhile purchase.

I am going to keep working on my Yoga and learning from my other DVD, but there are days when I feel a bit more stress that affects me (it usually either goes to my neck or my stomach) in different ways and I have reached for this DVD.

The only complaint is it is a little choppy. The segments are pieced together b/c they use them in other sections of the dvd. One minute you are lying on your mat and the next she's standing up.

There is something here for everyone, and I really love the breathing exercises.  Amazing on how breathing can help calm you down.

The section for neck and back issues is another favorite.  Cars and computers have put some strain on me, and these exercises have helped me feel alot better.

The Dalai Lama interview is a great bonus section.  He seems so approachable and warm and his message ties in well with the rest of the DVD and what it helps you accomplish.

The instructor's voice is soothing and clear, she has the insight of our body. The video is made with high quality. It was shot in a beautiful island whose scenery is quite inspiring.

Barbara Benagh leads you through the sessions and has a calm, soothing voice. She reminds you to breath, slow and steady. You get a total of 20sessions on the DVD. It is beautifully filmed at Half Moon Bay Resort in Antigua (much better than a boring yoga studio!). My only critic is that I would have liked to have a matrix where I could create my own sequencing from all the individual segments (like Shiva Rea's DVDs). Also, they should have published a booklet describing each session with the DVD, so here's my version ;o) Print this out and keep with your DVD.

2655131,5,B000ICLRKW,"I have been looking for a yoga dvd like this for such a long time and I am so happy I ordered this one!  Most dvds end in a short 1 minute relaxation practice, but this one really emphasizes relaxation of body, mind and breath throughout all of the practices.

Each practice is easy to complete (you don't have to be super athletic to do them).  They also have a profound impact.  I get relaxed just watching the dvd, doing it is even better.  Highly recommended for someone looking to connect with their body and take a chance at living a life that moves a little slower.",1181001600,25,572,4.308411214953271

I have senstive, nervous temperament and this dvd is a blessing, helping me heal and release old holding patterns, feeling more centered, relaxed, energized than I have in a long, long time.  There is such a good offering of different sessions, each one targeting different issues, and being good workouts in themselves.  One of my all time favorite yoga dvds",1179360000,27,462,4.910256410256411

2655135,4,B000ICLRKW,"This is an excellent video. It is slow-paced and really helps me

unwind. It is broken up into a number of routines, so you can do

an hour-long routine in the morning, or you can settle for just 25

minutes. The evening routines are mostly about 40 minutes. There

are also routines targetted at sleeplesness and neck and shoulder

problems. The bonus interviews are not particularly interesting, but

that's ok. Barbara Benagh is a truly wonderful yoga instructor and I

plan to buy more DVD's with her as the instructor. If there was one

feature I would have liked to have, it would be the ability to program

my own routines by combining individual practices.",1178928000,18,664,4.7043478260869565

She is a treasure to study with, in person or via your own DVD player, and this video communicates her unique and introspective take on yoga practice beautifully. I always think of yoga as a path filled with small but profound revelations, and studying with Barbara through the DVD will undoubtedly guide you to some of these 'aha' moments.

Her introductory talk, narration and instruction are clear and down to earth, which will appeal to those who do not go in for the flowery language and all-too-transparent yoga gush that has crept into other yoga videos.  To conclude:  my guess is that you will love to practice using this intelligent, accessible and time flexible DVD. Make it an addition to your yoga library.",1177891200,36,859,4.713333333333333

I've been battling stress and anxiety for a few months now and have found this DVD to be exceptionally helpful in ""letting go"" of daily stress and calming my thoughts.  Highly recommended!",1177286400,23,477,4.642857142857143
2655139,5,B000ICLRKW,"I have to confess I had become a lapsed Hatha Yogini. After years of practice, a few intervening accidents and life intervened and my Hatha Yoga practice was sacrificed in the caldron of daily life.

While I was aware of my body absorbing the toxins of people's nasty attitudes, violence on TV and in the newspaper,etc, I chose to persist in the exingencies of my work and studies ignoring the calls of my ailing body.

In that my work and study centers around stress relief and I am a student of the Dalai Lama, I decided to check out this video.

In my experience this is one of the best yoga videos among the now 1,055 yoga videos now listed on Amazon. It combines meditation instructions from the DVD  A Path to Happiness by the Dalai Lama and a host of stress relief combinations from gentle awakening to more vigorous awakening to working on what malady our bodies are using to signal us that we are out of balance.

The instructions are clear and concise without undue explanation. (For students who seek more understanding of the poses, the videos of Rodney Yee, Patricia Walden, John Friend and  many others are out there.)

The instructions are for the average person. There are no Sanskrit names. There is excellent attention to proper alignment, appropriate focus and attention and use of props. Her breathing instructions are the best that I have heard from any yoga instuctor.

As I practiced these routines I could literally feel toxins depart, my stiffness start to leave and my ""energy"" flow more freely.

This is the video of a seasoned Hatha Yoga instructor and practioner and yoga practioner. If you want to learn complex advanced poses and their Sanskrit names, don't buy this video. If you want to detoxify, and restore balance to your life, this is the video for you.",1176595200,336,1790,4.693290734824281
2655140,5,B000ICLRKW,"I enjoy and enjoyed this DVD so much!  The ability to practice with your time constraints and physical needs in mind is more than wonderful.  The user can pick between stomach/digestion problems, hip pain relief, stress relief, insomnia, etc, programs. I always appreciate this feature.

I have Barbara's Power Yoga DVD also, and as with that one, I appreciate her calm voice, detailed instruction and the pleasant (low) background music.

If you just want something to get started in the mornings or to calm down with in the evenings, this dvd is also for you.",1176163200,21,416,4.148148148148148

It works out tension, realigns hips and is great for the SI joint.  My flexibility is constantly improving and my strenght is coming back (I am a very inflexible persona and this tape works for me).  This has helped to lessen my headaches and holds the poses long enough to make a difference and to allow you to do them right.  The instruction is excellent and she always give modifications for those of us with little flexibility.  I would recommend this tape to anyone who has had previous yoga experience (you should always go to a yoga teacher first to learn the proper way to do the exercises before doing tapes...my feeling only).

2655145,5,B000ICLRKW,"This is an extremely versatile DVD by renowned yoga instructor Barbara Benagh.  She has combined short posture segments into a series of 20 different practices addressing a variety of stress-related conditions, from energizing after a long day to coping with aches and pains to relieving various digestive conditions.  The practices, which are slow-moving with a mostly restorative focus, range in length from 15 to 60 minutes, making it easy to fit yoga into even your busiest days.  Barbara frequently uses props; in addition to a yoga mat, I would recommend that you have at least one blanket on hand (preferably 2-3), with pillows and an eye bag being optional.

A breakdown of the DVD is listed below.  The headings are the items found on the main menu, and the bullets indicate submenu items.  The times for each practice are given as they appear on-screen, but I've added times in parentheses based on my own review.  I've included brief descriptions of each individual practice.

Discussion of Meditation by HH The Dalai Lama (35)

Beginning and Ending Your Day
* Begin Your Day Slowly, 25m (24.5) - starts slowly on the floor and gradually moves into more active postures, including sun salutations
* Wake Up! 60m (58) - nice, slow flow combining seated breath work, sun salutation/standing postures, and seated forward bends
* Evening Revival, 40m (35.5) - starts in child's pose and moves on to standing postures and then shoulder/back stretches on the floor
* Letting Go of the Day, 40m (37) - a series of floor and restorative postures, including reclined cobbler's, supported child's pose, and seated forward bends/twists
* Insomnia Series, 35m (36) - relaxing postures to help prepare for sleep; starts with simple standing poses and moves on to seated forward bends, supported cobbler's and child's pose, and legs-up-the-wall

Neck, Shoulder, and Back Issues
* Easing Neck & Shoulder Tension, passive, 20m (19) - a series of reclined postures allowing passive relaxation of the neck and shoulders
* Easing Neck & Shoulder Tension, active, extended, 30m (29) - more active stretches of the neck, shoulders, and upper back from both seated and standing positions; ends with legs-up-the-wall
* Lower Back Tension, 35m (35.5) - reclined and prone postures to open up the back
* Hip Pain (SI Joint), 25m (36) - a series of gentle hip-opening postures including reclined leg stretch, open half lotus, and prone postures
* Tension Headaches, 45m (44) - a combination of sequences from both the passive and the active neck and shoulders segments above; ends with legs-up-the-wall plus a lengthy relaxation

Easing Your Mind
* Breathing Exercises to Calm the Mind, 15m (15) - a slowly moving series of different breathing techniques while lying
* Restorative Poses for Relaxation, 15m (13.5) - three simple postures to facilitate deep relaxation (supported cobbler's, heart opener, legs-up-the-wall)
* Deep Rest, 20m (18) - reclined breathing combined with a lengthy relaxation segment
* Mood Uplift, 30m (32.5) - offers a combination of calming and more active postures, starting with standing postures and moving to supported bridge and supported heart opener
* Serenity in Stillness, 35m (40.5) - combines elements of the digestive, hips, and neck practices; my favorite so far, especially with the supported bridge
* Anxiety Relief, 50m (40) - focuses largely on breathwork to calm the mind; also includes prone poses, reclined twist, and supportive postures

Stomach and Digestion Issues
* Constipation, 25m (27) - gentle prone postures to stimulate the stomach combined with standing and seated twists

* IBS, 30m (26.5) - starts with reclined breathwork and moves on to seated forward bends; ends with half shoulderstand and legs-up-the-wall
* Diarrhea & Indigestion, 30m (25) - nice series of gentle supported postures to open the upper back and release the stomach, ending with supported bridge and legs-up-the-wall; another favorite!

One final important note is that not all of the practices end with the traditional relaxation pose, or savasana:  some conclude with legs-up-the-wall pose, others end in a relaxed seated position.  Overall, this is an excellent yoga DVD well-suited to a wide range of practitioners, from those fairly new to yoga to more experienced yoginis like myself.

I also have stiff shoulder and neck from time to time as a result of my job (sitting in front of a computer).
