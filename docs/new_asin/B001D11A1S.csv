3521404,3,B001D11A1S,"Not up to Lewis Black's normally excellent standards.  Too repetitious in parts, though it is difficult to pan Lewis' sharp and always entertaining wit.",1264809600,,152,5.333333333333333
3521405,5,B001D11A1S,"Full of intelligent discussion about the fundamentals of comedy from those who know it best. A multitude of great comedians weigh in, including the late George Carlin. Someone said something to this effect in an earlier review, but I absolutely agree: listening to Carlin discuss comedy is like getting a music theory class from Beethoven. Anyway, throughout, Lewis Black serves as a great interviewer, and it's always heartwarming to watch Black (a comedy heavyweight himself) laugh his ass off while interviewing his own comedy icons. Definitely worth the buy.",1259020800,6,562,5.325842696629214
3521406,5,B001D11A1S,"Lewis Black is a laugh out loud good time! All of his stand up is great! I am really excited about this new trailer for Lewis Black's stand up, [...] Enjoy!",1253836800,,156,4.064516129032258
3521407,5,B001D11A1S,"Great approach to the subject.  As always, Lewis Black delivers his approach to this subject in his very amusing style.  This is a great addition to my Lewis Black collection.",1253836800,5,175,4.8
3521408,4,B001D11A1S,"If you didn't see this show on the History channel it is worth it to pick it up on DVD.  You have some of the best comedians around (and one amateur one) just telling jokes and discussing the ins and outs of comedy.  The highlight of the DVD now seems to be the interview between Lewis Black and George Carlin.  Listening to Carlin discuss comedy is like listening to Beethoven talk about music.

My only complaint that makes this 4-stars instead of 5 is the fact that the DVD is censored.  I understand beeping out foul language when it's on TV, but if I'm paying $25 for the DVD, I'd kinda like to hear the ""F"" word.

Even with the censored language it is still a DVD worth getting, and you will laugh, over and over again even with multiple viewings.  The topics range from PG-rated to X-rated, so please be aware that it is not family friendly.  But hell, just put the kids to bed, the DVD is funny as hell.",1227657600,27,911,4.255813953488372

3521411,5,B001D11A1S,"Yes, Lewis Black and his dogmatic anti-rights rants and anti-spiritual rants can get old fast.  But, he is absolutley brilliantly hillarious here and it's not all about him so it turns out fantastic!  Even if you often find Lewis tiresome, get this!  It's hillarious!",1410220800,,267,5.0227272727272725

3521414,5,B001D11A1S,"I love this account because it is a fun and entertaining team effort for giving viewers piercing insight into how we got the modern joke.  I also love it because the leader of this effort is Lewis Black, one of the funniest men around.  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys the high-adrenaline form of comedian delivery.",1387929600,3,320,4.5964912280701755
3521415,4,B001D11A1S,"I saw this the first time, and thought it was HILARIOUS!! Bought the cd...it was OK...I wonder if they didn't have all the scenes the History Channel version did?",1385942400,,162,4.620689655172414

3521417,4,B001D11A1S,"I purchased this DVD recently. I watched it and I really liked it. Like another person on here says, I agree they shouldn't have ""bleeped"" out the cuss words. But overall it was very funny and interesting. Lewis Black fans be aware he just hosts this thing. It's still a good DVD to watch so I don't regret buying it.",1297728000,2,317,4.3

8290811,4,B001D11A1S,While sharing the history of comedy this aspires to explain what comedy IS and how it causes people to laugh. An educator aspires to provide an explanation then the host interviews many famous comedians and they share their experiences and some material. Includes the difficulties of the art/craft. Words bleeped out. Occasional insight.,1513209600,,337,5.377358490566038

Excellent organization, very educational and entertaining with some great jokes by some masters of the game.",1454716800,,264,5.463414634146342
8290816,5,B001D11A1S,"This documentary (if that's what you want to call it) is absolutely worth the purchase. While it's upsetting that there is no special features at all, this is still a great addition to the library of anyone who genuinely appreciates comedy.",1437264000,,240,4.878048780487805

8290818,5,B001D11A1S,"Awsome documentary!!!! Lewis Black interviews the late Robin Williams , George Carlin, Penn and Teller etc. The only bad part of this documentary is that it's bleeped so it isn't side splitting funny but funny enough to be worth every pennie of its price.",1427500800,,255,4.818181818181818
