8756782,3,B01DSUK5LM,"I give it three starts why I grew up to this series and its going well so far but the problem is it doesn't show no preview for the next episode or so the beginning of the episode it just skips to the title of the episode and it doesn't show the opening and ending theme until the DVD is done but of their was some way I can get that then that would be great thank you
