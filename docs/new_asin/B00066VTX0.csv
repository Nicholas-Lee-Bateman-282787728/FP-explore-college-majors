Literally I've never heard such terrible dialogue in a film.",1442966400,,250,4.659090909090909

8039458,1,B00066VTX0,"i knew before i watched this that with David Steinberg in it (in anything else that i have caught that he was in he was terrible in those also e.g. smothers brothers, music scene, any tonight show appearance, etc) so didn't expect much but uh!! this was soooooo bad! n dragged! i just kept fast forwarding till i finally made it to the end but i'm stunned that even way back then how studios would think to put him in a lead role much less a romantic role? i cant even tell you just how much their is zero chemistry between these two and it just seemed that DS was just trying to b cute. if you want to watch a dvd that will b on your worst 10 of all time go ahead and get this one for sure!",1434240000,,691,3.942857142857143
8039459,2,B00066VTX0,I think Sarandon & Steinberg are double-daring to make an obvious  knock-off of ANNIE HALL. My son lives in upper Manhattan. I wonder what he thinks of this film.,1402876800,,162,4.586206896551724
8039460,1,B00066VTX0,"THIS MOVIE STINKS ITS SO BAD , SURPRISED SUSAN SARANDON WOULD LOWER HERSELF BY MAKING A MOVIE LIKE THIS, SHE IS SUPER ACTRESS",1271030400,,125,4.478260869565218
8039461,1,B00066VTX0,"This movie is so bad that it's instructive. It is a wonderful lesson in everything that can go wrong with a movie. Young aspiring moviemakers should study it to learn what NOT to do. Every movie starts with a script and this movie has none. It started out as an attempt to be a romantic comedy like the great ones of the 30's and the 40's, but it forgot to provide any back story for the characters, it forgot to make them into any kind of individuals, it forgot to provide anything except stick figures in stock scenes. And it forgot that it's always a good idea to have some kind of plot in a romantic comedy, some kind of reason that people get together, some reason to split, and some reason to get back together. The script missed it all. Not only a script is needed, you also need actors who have at least a little chemistry. David Steinberg and Susan Sarandon have no chemistry whatsoever, just plain none. Steinberg looks like he is trying to swallow a sour milkshake everytime he looks at Sarandon, and Sarandon looks like she is trying to swallow her tongue every time she has to look at Steinberg. And every supporting actor in the whole movie has obviously found that just getting through their lines is enough work without trying to add anything to them. Marilyn Sokol is the only standout in this film -- an obviously gifted comedian who is made up and haired out to look like a freak in this movie, whose best moves are wasted because it's so hard to get past how garrish she looks. Add to this the bad camera work, the glaring bright lighting, the stock scenes, the entire movie is an atrocity. I guess you can find some pleasure in seeing a dial phone again, and an early answering machine, as well as the thrill that used to come from seeing the old Pan American 747 Clippers. But that's about it -- a few props that were badly framed in this wonderful example of just how bad a film can be. I dare you to watch the whole thing. You probably can't.",1262304000,3,1966,4.359673024523161
8039462,1,B00066VTX0,No substance and the plot sucks.,1135555200,,32,4.5
8039463,5,B00066VTX0,This is a great heartwarming romantic comedy starring Susan Sarandon and David Steinberg about two single people starting a relationship after being hurt from other relationships. It's a must see that will finally be released on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!,1129507200,3,243,5.594594594594595
