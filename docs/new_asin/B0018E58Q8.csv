3417312,4,B0018E58Q8,"This collection includes all of the episodes of this favorite TV series.  It's obvious the transfers were from broadcast TV as the station identification is there on screen.  A few of the episodes are of poorer quality but the majority are fine.  I haven't noticed any thing special about the sound although the box claims it's enhanced.  Overall a treasure for the fans of the series, but not the best quality DVDs by a stretch.",1244678400,26,429,4.68
3417313,4,B0018E58Q8,I nice trip down memory lane.  These shows are just as I remember...but very low-tech! Gotta love that Lloyd Bridges.,1244332800,4,117,4.85

8269655,5,B0018E58Q8,I used to watch every episode on black and white TV when I was a kid. Now I can see them again and again on my computer or TV. Love them.,1469232000,,137,3.4516129032258065
8269656,5,B0018E58Q8,"I used to see these pictures as I was a child, actually it is very amusing to remember the one or the other episode.
All is in a very good condition and it came in an unexpected  very short time to Germany!
Thank You very much!",1379894400,,227,3.9347826086956523
8269657,5,B0018E58Q8,"I purchased ""Sea Hunt"" from a private seller on amazon.com almost 4 years ago and am very glad that I have it. However I would be thrilled if it would finally get a release on DVD's with ALL episodes and in restored quality. I like ""Sea Hunt"" even better than ""Flipper"" or ""SOS Charterboat"", it was such a very compelling and thrilling TV series. Probably the best that Lloyd Bridges ever did in his entire movie and TV career.

Many of those who loved the ""Sea Hunt"", ""Flipper"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.

BTW ""Bronco"" fans can now get an amazon.com alert once ""Bronco"" will be released on DVD. Great news!",1323734400,,1009,4.8604651162790695
8269658,5,B0018E58Q8,"This is one of my all time favorite shows. Although it's a bootleg, most of the episodes are very good quality. The package arrived quickly and in the condition described. I would definitley recommend this vendor and wouldn't hesitate to by from them again should the opportunity arise.",1315180800,,286,4.979166666666667
8269659,5,B0018E58Q8,"Yes the quality of the transfer to DVD is so so, but so was watching television in 1959.
I first purchased the set through ""Classic Theatre of New York"" 2006 in 4 volumes, I was mostly pleased with
what I received, the packaging was okay with 8 DVD per volume.
There was only a photograph on the DVD and once played just a typed list of 4 episodes per DVD,
yes they were copies only with nothing much professional about the release, and yes DVD of volume 4
only contained 8 episodes of the ""Addams Family""rather than what I expected.
So later I went and bought the ""Platinum"" release, 3 volumes in plastic sleeves for $300 Aus,
which in 2011 is worth more than the U.S $.  ""Digitally Remasted Sound Enhanced"", pretty impressive
for episodes that were basically the same as my previous purchase.
Though there were improvements, such as on the front of each DVD there listed the 4 episodes therein,
and once played there were a proper list of each episode with a main photograph in the centre,
although DVD 38 of volume 3 did not play.
So I have replaced my original set with the ""Platinum"" set in the original containers - as I do not care
for plastic sleeves- and I have my missing episodes from the original set,
Roustaboat.....  PT Boat..... Crime At Sea..... Roundup....
so I am one happy fish person, with my favourite program.",1307318400,3,1331,4.518672199170124
8269660,5,B0018E58Q8,"I gave it 5 stars because I loved Sea Hunt , it does say that these have been remastered but I am not too sure about that as some of the picture quality is very low on some of the episodes. LLoyd Bridges plays Mike Nelson a guy who seems to be a jack of all trades hired every week to fix or solve underwater related problems. The episodes run for about 20-24 minutes each and still seem very quick paced which is good for the age of them. Not many big stars were in Sea Hunt apart from a young Larry Hagman and Leonard Nimoy pre Star Trek days. His boys Beau and Jeff make very early appearances but I had trouble spotting them as they are very young in this series. Still this is a very good set and if you are into classic tv shows like I am you will enjoy it",1268092800,7,762,3.92258064516129

8269662,5,B0018E58Q8,Could not be happier with these DVD sets. Lloyd Bridges at his finest in one of the greatest TV dramas of all time. Quality was top-notch and seller was professional and courteous. What else can you ask for?,1254700800,,207,4.473684210526316
8269663,1,B0018E58Q8,"Most of DVDs are blank. Meaning there is nothing there. Won't play on my iMac, PC, DVD player or my Xbox 360. And no way to contact company to get replacements.",1249603200,19,160,4.193548387096774
8269664,5,B0018E58Q8,"It was very good. The picture quality and audio quality was very good,considering that this was an old tv show. I am very glad that I was able to find it on amazon.com. Thank you.",1246752000,3,179,4.142857142857143
