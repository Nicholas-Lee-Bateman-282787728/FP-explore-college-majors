It's make it or break it time for each of the Teutul men as they head off in separate directions after a bruising family breakup.

With Stubborn determination, Senior continues his struggle to keep OCC afloat during difficult financial times with hard work and a take-no-prisoners attitude.

Having been banished from the company he helped build, Paul Jr. has come full circle, literally, as he sets up his own shop in the shadow of Orange County Iron Works. Junior is driven by his desire for success, but also by his need to prove something to his father and to himself.

Everyone is taking sides and heads are turning as the competition heats up. Is the writing on the wall for OCC now that Junior's back to building bikes? Who will come out on top as OCC and Paul Jr. Designs start cranking out competing bikes, side by side.
