265484,4,6300186016,"Mae West had a Broadway smash when she penned the bawdy tale of DIAMOND LIL for herself--and with a few tweaks here and there the story came to the screen as SHE DONE HIM WRONG.  The film was an immediate hit and the role of Lady Lou remains one of West's best remembered performances. The script is jam-packed with some of West's most famous lines, including the memorable ""Come up'n see me sometime.  I'm home every evenin'"" and ""You can be had.""  West throws her lines with style, aplomb, enough innuendo to make a censor cringe, and considerable humor--but, somewhat surprisingly, the movie is not really a comedy.
SHE DONE HIM WRONG is a hard-knocks tale of Bowery bruisers who dance attendance upon the 'Lady Lou' and often resort to crime to keep her dripping in the diamonds she prizes above all else. But although she has one lover already locked up in jail, another one mixed up in the white slavery rackets, and still a third waiting to step into the gap, the Lady Lou is more interested in seducing missionary Cary Grant... only to find him less interested in her body than her soul, a circumstance that prompts West to utter one of the most how-did-that-get-past-the-censors lines in 1930s cinema: ""Maybe I ain't got no soul.""
This is a surprisingly tough little movie, and in addition to West's zinging lines and occasional musical numbers SHE DONE HIM WRONG also offers a glimpse at a very young (and still slightly wooden) Cary Grant; it also has an ensemble cast that plays in a very enjoyable grand manner, truly first rate production values all the way, and A surprisingly brisk running time.  West did funnier films than this, but the mix of her sharp wit and the rough story is particularly memorable.  This is where the fire started really started, and I recommend it very strongly.",1018915200,30,1804,4.69620253164557
265485,5,6300186016,"The spicey humour and sexual double entendres that characterised West's career where brought to the nation's attention this little 66 minute film from 1933.  SHE DONE HIM WRONG  is a most enjoyable vehicle for Mae's comedic talents ( it was based upon her successful 1928 hit play DIAMOND LIL ). Mae was fair, fat and forty, but her timing, inflection and phrases are pure fun, and her demeanor and carriage brought to the screen the playful sexiness with which she was so integrally associated.  The direction by the former stage actor Lowell Sherman is excellent as the it leaves the viewer with a good idea of what the atmosphere of the Bowery in the 'nineties was like.  However, it's obvious that West carried the movie where she desired it to be led.  Grant's portrayal is well-done and believable; his transition from missionary to detective is quite acceptable.  A classic comedy and a classic seduction.",997315200,4,912,4.8896103896103895
265486,4,6300186016,"That about sums up the plot of ""She Done Him Wrong"", starring the hip swerving Mae West as barroon chanteuse Diamond Lou. There's not a man in the picture who isn't lusting after Lou, and she lets more than one have a sampling of some of her charms. But while there are double entendres ricocheting off the chandeliers, Mae is always clad, and promises more than she really delivers. She's something of a two-timer, maybe even a five-timer, but you don't hold it against her as she says what needs to be said at the moment. Counterfeiters, white slavers, and jailbreakers round out some of the extra-Mae activities.
Watch this funny movie--she may have done him wrong, but she'll serve you right.",995846400,5,696,4.713114754098361
265487,5,6300186016,"Mae West was a veteran of burlesque, vaudeville and the Broadway stage by the time she made her first film in 1932 at the age of 39.  ""She Done Him Wrong"" was her second film and her first starring role in an adaptation of her smash Broadway hit ""Diamond Lil"".  It was a play that West had written herself and it played to packed houses on Broadway for years.  This film was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture and made Cary Grant into an instant star.  Mae went on to write nine of the fourteen screenplays for films in which she was to star.  Thus, all those great quotes we've heard that are attributed to her were not only said by her, but written by her as well.  By 1935, she was the most highly paid woman in America.  To this day, she remains one of the female stars most often imitated by female impersonators.
This film is among her best.  It is full of the bawdy double entendre that became her trademark.  She was the queen of sexual innuendo and suggestive dialogue and many of her lines have become part of Americana (e.g. ""Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?""  And, ""A hard man is good to find.""  And of course, ""Come up and see me sometime."")
The plot of this film is simplistic and it is clearly a vehicle for her enormous talent, leading up to the now famous proposal by Cary Grant at the end of the film.  Mae commands every frame of the film with her incomparable combination of sex appeal and ribald humor.  Her sense of comic timing is impeccable making the funny lines she writes that much more hilarious by the snide way in which she delivers them.
Before this film, Cary Grant had appeared in half a dozen films and was building a reputation as a solid actor.  However, none of his early films gave him the exposure that this film did due to its wild popularity at the time.  West handpicked him for the part saying that he combined virility with the bearing of a gentleman.  She wanted someone who would epitomize the now famous line, ""Hello, warm, dark and handsome.""  Though his role in this film is minor compared to West's, it made him a household name and a bankable star.
This classic film is a piece of film history that shouldn't be missed.  I rated it a 10/10.  It is among Mae West's best moments.  I highly recommend it.",989539200,13,2294,4.303030303030303
265488,5,6300186016,"Mae West's first starring film, and her best -- nominated for an Oscar as best picture, and it should have won. It's a surprisingly serious and absorbing portrait of New York City's Bowery at the turn of the century,  with Mae as a kept woman who develops a yen for Salvation Army captain Cary  Grant. It won't spoil the surprise to tell you he turns out to be a  Government Man, and at the end he takes her away in handcuffs, with the  comment that many men would have been better off if she had been born  wearing them. ""I dunno... hands ain't everything,"" she purrs. A  huge hit in its time, and a true classic of American cinema.",964137600,4,633,4.277310924369748
265489,4,6300186016,"This was the first Mae West film I have seen, and I was curious to see if she would live up to her reputation.  She did.  West stars as Lou, a singer with a penchant for diamonds and men.  She's mixed up with a bunch of white  slave traders and crooks.  West has a wisecrack for everything, and more  than enough male admirers to keep her busy.  But the one guy she wants, she  can't seem to get, and that's do-gooder Cary Grant, the recipient of her  famous ""Come up and see me sometime"" line that has made her  immortal in films.  West has a great screen presence and she exudes  sexuality.  She must have been a shock to Thirties film audiences.  The  film moves along briskly (it's just over an hour), and the dialogue really  keeps your attention, as does Mae.  The lady had a way with words.",963705600,7,797,4.241610738255034

The spicy humor and double entendres that characterized West's career are all evident here and the  film made a fortune for Paramount when it was first released in 1933. It  was this movie which ignited the attention of the notorious Hays Code which  was in existence since 1930 yet largely ignored by it's creators. Mae West  was revolutionary in early thirties cinema; her demeanor and carriage  brought to the screen a playful sexiness which alternately shocked and  delighted the public. This was one of designer Edith Head's very early  assignments and her gowns for West's Lady Lou were exactly right.",944611200,12,719,5.094017094017094

265546,5,6300186016,"In a quotation from the movie introduction, it is the era of confidential legs. Indeed. The beer was 5 cents a glass then. But wait. The most importantly we have Cary Grant in this movie. His character has his trademark personified charm galore. It is Cary Grant's beautifully  real charm, unsophisticated, gorgeous, in his ever fresh, youthfulness. He is playing a ""slick hawk"". Again, he plays with his trademark perfection.
We are amply entertained too, here, by ""Lady Lou"", and that is Mae West in her  diamond dressed best. Diamonds are her carrier, she says or rather her career and we believe her, as she has a real display of ""rocks"" on her in this movie. She wears them and glances at them with such a  delightful  pride.  In ""She Done Him Wrong"", Mae West personifies the whole era of ""bad"" girls and she does it as effortlessly as  her character requires it in this movie.
The more I view this movie, the more details I register to my delight. Like cabaret songs sung by a charming male singer that give you the real thirties style of cabaret singing, so unique and not mushy at all.
This disc is dressed with introduction by Robert Osborne, who's wholesomeness in movie industry  of to-day has no match. Seeing Mr. Osborne  guarantees a given movie that something chosen, exclusive and for the right reason.",1460246400,,1319,4.67965367965368

265551,3,6300186016,"Frankie and Johnnie were lovers right from the very start, they swore they would be true to each other, just as true as the stars above, he was her man but he was doing her wrong, hummed Ralph Stanley as he thought about the film that he had just watched, Mae Wests She Done Him Wrong, where a version of the old traditional tune served as background music and one of Lady Lous (Mae Wests character here) stage numbers. He thought as him hummed that that was the beauty of the old traditional, anonymous tunes that had been handed down orally by our forebears since he had remembered the version which Sam Eaton his old friend, political comrade, and folk aficionado had played for him long ago, Mississippi John Hurts Frankie and Albert, same wronged sentiment but different verses learned by him by some forbear down in the Delta back in the 1920s sometime.

That was not exactly the version that Lady Lou sang either not when Ralph looked it up in the Arise and Sing, the folk song bible used this day by budding folkies and old-timers, although given the Frankie and Johnnie names which could be either male or female nicknames no wonder there could be a certain amount of confusion. What is more important though in the film the one doing the wrong gee is all switched up. It is the she not he doing the wrong. Doing wrong big time as Lady Lou leaves a trail of broken hearts across the screen, leaves every guy but one hanging by his toes.

Here is how Lady Lou played the game, how a woman played the mans game in the mans world of the Gay Nineties and lived to tell about it. The Bowery in New York City was wide open for every kind of corruption, of every dirty deed and Lady Lou was out to grab her share, no quarter given. As the film opened Lady Lou was keeping company with a well-connected saloon-keeper whom she gammed onto after her previous fancy man got caught stealing some diamonds that the lady was addicted to having on her person just to keep her warm and cozy on those cold winter night. A half dozen other guys including a sidewalk Lothario, a barroom bouncer, a backroom political and a snitch were all in the hunt for those diamonds to win her heart, if she had a heart. She blew them all off, gave them the air in the end except for the Captain, played by a very young and not yet distinctly film handsome Cary Grant.

Yeah, Lady Lou had the itch for the Captain, had it so bad it spawned the famous movie line about coming up to see her sometime to keep away the lonely nights. The Captain though was undercover as crime and corruption cop working as a guy running a Mission to save souls, if you can believe hard-bitten task among the damned of the Bowery. He was out to run the saloon-owner and bunch of other guys into the slammer. And did so, did so with ease. Of course there was some side action, that guy up in stir escaping to see his Lady Lou and getting the brush-off by her although not before offing that guy who snitched on him. The sidewalk Lothario also got the heave-ho. Lady Lou though seems to have lived a charmed life since even though she killed a Madame who was giving her trouble over the Lothario the Captain (known on the street as the Hawk) turned out to have been captivated by her charms and they go off in a carriage as the Hawk tries to make an honest woman out of Lady Lou. Good luck, brother, good luck.

Heres the beauty of this film though for feminists, Lady Lou is her own woman and she will use up men as fast as she can and think nothing of it, a little role reversal in this wicked old world and unusual in a day when a  lot of womens film roles were as damsels in distress. Yeah, she done wrong by the fistfuls. Here is where Ralph was scratching his head though. Old Lady Lou was, well, full-figured in todays speak and while that designation which previously had had negative connotations is being broken down by popular full-figured female actors like Melissa McCarthy it was not then the norm. Personally Ralph, although he liked and had married a full-figured woman, couldn't figure Lady Lous attraction to the Hawk. If memory served him right Cary Grant went for those thin wispy types like Katherine Hepburn and Audrey Hepburn so go figure. All Ralph knew was that back in the day, back in the 1890s he would have stayed very clear of Lady Lou. Yeah, he knew she would do him wrong, very wrong.",1455321600,,4370,4.3570552147239265

It also made Cary Grant a major star. The studio took a chance at the time by making a film about the 1890's, and it certainly worked! With the 1933 technology, you actually get a nostalgic feel of what NYC life was like back then! The singing by solo and quartet '1890's-style' performers is excellent!.

Based on the stage play ""Diamond Lil"", West plays the girlfriend of a criminal bar owner who has bought her expensive diamonds, but she has cheated on him with a variety of other men. One of them is none other than an undercover policeman who is after said bar owner.

The movie had good potential for comedy or drama, but realizes neither. It is instead dull, and Mae West proved to be a weak performer and an even worse singer. Presumably she was more famous for being rebellious than for her talent.",1427846400,,792,4.609929078014185

She Done Him Wrong (1933) provides her first starring role as Lady Lou, a woman based on her famous Diamond Lil character. This runs a mere 60 minutes and has a rather unfocused but quite interesting plot. It teams the legendary Miss West with newcomer Cary Grant, who she claims to have ""discovered"" for the movie, claiming up until that time he done ""some tests with starlets"". This is untrue, Mr. Grant had become a well-known actor in 1932 with Blonde Venus opposite Marlene Dietrich. She Done Him Wrong is not the perfect movie by any means, but its a quite intriguing one.

265732,5,6300186016,"Mae West rarely gets credit for her work behind the camera. She was often responsible for the story and shaping of her films, and her hand is heavy on this one, which is grittier than much modern film and tv.  Due to the times there're no overt sex scenes, nudity, or graphic violence, but much is going on covertly: pregnant girls turned into prostitutes, business men who use unscrupulous practices wrestling each other to become powerful political forces, the criminal underpinnings of urban nightclubs; the harsh & grimy side of urban life in an America barely out of the Wild West. What's different from modern depictions of this time is that West shows us there were powerful women in this milieu (unlike a terrifically graphic show like ""Deadwood,"" for instance, where women are mostly depicted as pawns). Women like West's character, Lou, and Rita the Russian, use their intelligence and abilities to gain wealth, and become powerful figures. In one memorable scene, Lou negotiates a deal to buy a building with a diamond necklace that'd been given her as a present. Lou knows she lives in world where men make the rules, but as she tells a young woman early in the film, women just need to play their game better than men do.

It's wonderful to see West play the type of character Grant would soon play in movies - in control of every situation, always having the opposite sex on the ropes.  But whereas Grant can sometimes seem like a bully to the modern eye, West's vulnerability as a woman makes her character more sympathetic - she's had to survive, and has ultimately thrived, in a rough world, as part of the second sex.  The movie mirrors West's life, in some way, a woman who worked hard to gain fame and fortune, but because she used her sexuality and beauty to advantage, was looked down upon, drooled over by men, while not really getting the credit due her, not just for her savvy, but for her intelligence and the full extent of her creative prowess as a filmmaker.

""She Done Him Wrong"" also features some wonderful musical numbers, which may seem dated now, but if you're into music, it's a wonderful chance to experience the pop music singing & performing style of the Gay 90's.  West does three numbers, and her ability to play with beat and timing was amazing, alternately speeding up and slowing down a song to suit her interpretation of it's lyrics. There's a bit of N.O. jazz ladled underneath some of the music, and rag time piano thruout.  A great movie - perhaps dated in the style of acting, but, like reading literature from the past, it shines with the luster of it's times, as well as having a decidedly Modern point of view.",1393718400,,2662,4.651063829787234

Some are pretty good and sometimes her gestures and movements add to them. Other times they just did not do much for me.

An interesting piece of history, if nothing else. Cary Grant plays some kind of missionary/cop, and not all that well.

It does portray a rather seamy side of the gay 90s that is interesting in itself. Political corruption, white slavery, and other evils are portrayed as more or less the norm in the Bowery, which might not have been far from the truth.",1392681600,,728,4.306569343065694

I would recommend this to anyone into nostalgia. It is a short movie at about 65 minutes. Don't look for great acting, it sure isn't here. Mae West was fun to watch and Cary Grant was about the best actor. In 1933 this was a ""hot"" film but by todays standards it would be rated ""G"". The kids would probably be bored.

Here are some examples (and not all of these are in this movie):  ""Marriage is a great institution, but I'm not ready for an institution."" ""It's not the men in my life, it's the life in my men."" ""Too much of a good thing is wonderful."" I could go on and on. She is brilliant. She is sheer comic genius. She was an incredible pioneer and her personality takes over the whole screen.

This tale did incredibly well at the Box Office but was a bore for me. The cinematography (even for 1933) was bad as the film stopped and then started a couple of times. I found little humor in this ""comedy"", too.

That said, it saved Paramount from bankruptcy. Mae West was older and heavier but the public loved her regardless. Because they were worried about censorship the movie turned out to be arguably better than the play (though at this time who is going to tell me they have seen the play?).

Cary Grant was leading man in his second year as an actor. Mae West claimed to have discovered Cary Grant but he had done several movies before this one.

It is one of three Mae West ""essentials""; the other two being I'M NO ANGEL and MY LITTLE CHICKADEE (with WC Fields, no less!) Mae West was camp before there was camp. Bette Middler based many of routines on West. Heck, even Salvador Dali painted her. I think he appreciated her surrealistic possibilities.

Her movies are confected like a gaudy, glittering cake with Mae West as the roman candle in the center just about to go off. What's really funny about her plays & movies is that in each one the males are falling all over themselves just to bask in Mae's sexual awesomeness.

In reality she was short and...well, rather plump. Her face was more matron than vamp. If you watch her walk, it has a striding effect, and you never see her feet because she wore platform shoes that were like stilts. West kept them concealed beneath eye-popping gowns with enormously long ""trains."". In I'M NO ANGEL West enters a circus ring riding on an elephant--and maybe for the first time, her partner (the elephant) is wearing more jewels than Mae. She finishes the circus act by putting her head inside a lions' mouth! She strides into a scene, plants herself down, and lets her eyes, abundant curves, & innuendos work their magic. Even her singing voice is technically only so-so, but it doesn't matter because it's all part of the package. I love her song routines.

265905,4,6300186016,"""She Done Him Wrong"" was the movie that brought Mae West's bawdy humor from Broadway to moviegoers everywhere and made her a Hollywood star. It was her first leading role in a film. Based on West's hit play ""Diamond Lil"", tempered somewhat to please the censors, audiences loved the double entendres and West's trashy glamour. It was a box office smash that reputedly saved Paramount from bankruptcy. In 1934, ""She Done Him Wrong"" became the shortest film ever nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, at 1 hour 6 minutes, as well as one of the few comedies to receive that honor.

In the Bowery district of 1890s New York, political boss and racketeer Gus Jordan (Noah Beery) is the envy of every man who visits his cabaret, not for his wealth or power, but for his mistress Lady Lou (Mae West). Lou is a saucy singer who does gold-diggers one better. ""Diamonds is my career,"" she declares. She'll attach herself to any man who is willing to deck her out in the gems. But Lou finds herself coveted by all the wrong men -not that she discourages them. The only man able to resist her charms is the handsome young Captain Cummings (Cary Grant) from the charitable mission next door...or can he.

""She Done Him Wrong"" opens with 10 minutes of praise for Lady Lou's beauty and charm spoken by men from every walk of life before the Lady herself makes an appearance. That kind of introduction is difficult to live up to, and she doesn't quite manage, but Mae West is a larger than life presence who speaks in suggestive quips, drips diamonds, and slinks around in gowns that she had to be sewn into.  West excelled in making disreputable women irresistible, and it's amazing to see what the force of her personality can do. ""She Done Him Wrong"" has an interesting set-up with very little pay-off, but there's no denying Mae West's entertainment value.

The DVD (Universal 2008): This is a good print of the film, with no obvious flaws in picture or sound. There is an optional Introduction (2 min) by Robert Osborne, who talks briefly about how the film saved Paramount and the changes that were made from the play. There is also a black-and-white animated short from 1933 entitled ""She Done Him Right"" (8 min) featuring Pooch the Pup. Clearly inspired by Mae West's film, Pooch pursues a slinky cabaret singer named Poodles, who spoofs Lady Lou. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and French.",1209686400,7,2401,4.66903073286052
265906,5,6300186016,"Never having seen ""She Done Him Wrong"" before (although I've heard plenty about its notoriety), I was pleased to find Mae West in top form. Yet another film based upon her notorious stage plays, it must've had quite an impact on audiences when it debuted. Although Miss West was not the first female comedian (Mabel Normand was there long before her), she was important in film history as the first female character which was strongly assertive. When others did her wrong, Mae was quick in putting them in their place with a suggestive comment or sharp one-liner. After spending years on the stage, Mae was an old pro at tossing out bawdy one-liners with ease, a trademark of her character. And she could speak volumes with just a roll of her eyes or sway of her hips; quite a contrast from today's actresses who must engage in graphic sex scenes or bare all to get our attention.
Armed with a strong script & surrounded with a solid cast (the young, handsome Cary Grant, Gilbert Roland, Noah Beery, Sr., etc.), Mae entered into a confrontation with the Censorship Bureau over the film's content---the first of many battles for her. Ultimately (and obviously), the film was made, was a box office smash, and saved Paramount Pictures from the brink of bankruptcy. Quit an impact, indeed!
Balancing comedy & drama, SDHW sets the mold for many vehicles in which Mae's character was continually assaulted because of her ""past"", but she always won out due to her unflappable manner & deep-down integrity. Singing & talking in her husky, slightly nasally voice, Mae was certainly impressionable.
Handsomely packaged & remastered, the DVD also includes a dandy introduction from Robert Osbourne, as well as an early cartoon clearly patterned after Miss West titled ""She Done Him Right"". Undoubtedly, Mae West at the peak of her powers.",1209427200,5,1828,4.9

In it, she co-stars with a very young and boyish Cary Grant, and while their physical pairing doesn't entirely sit well, their sizzling chemistry more than compensates.

Mae West is Lady Lou, the reigning singing star of the Bowery.  Although she's wooed and adored by just about every man that crosses her path, Lou wants the unattainable: Captain Cummings (Cary Grant), the local mission director.  In a plot overflowing with jailed former lovers, stolen diamonds and a Barbary Coast white slavery outfit, will Lou land her handsome Captain?  Watch and find out...

In SHE DONE HIM WRONG, Mae West cemented the archetypal character she'd more or less reprise in all of her subsequent movies.  Cary Grant perfectly pairs her, and the two would be reunited in West's next movie, ""I'm No Angel"" (released later the same year), an even bigger hit which helped pull Universal Studios out of it's financial reverses.

265994,5,6300186016,"I greet the release of She Done Him Wrong on DVD with mixed emotions.

First, my review of the film - She Done Him Wrong was Mae West's personal favorite among her 12 movies, and 75 years after its release, it is still considered a classic by most critics and many fans.  The film is often credited with saving Paramount Studios from bankruptcy, and made Mae West the box-office sensation of 1933.  Thanks to this film, the phrase, ""Come up and see me sometime"" entered the language and immortalized a woman now long-revered for her comic timing and salty double-entendres (although her most famous phrase was something of a misquote; her actual line to Cary Grant was, ""Why don't `cha come up sometime, see me?  Don't be afraid, I won't tell.  Come up, I'll tell your fortune.  Ooohh, you can be had!"").  Based on her notorious Broadway smash Diamond Lil, Miss West was forced to change the lead character's name (if not the basic plot) to appease the censors, and Diamond Lil became Lady Lou, ""One of the finest women ever walked the streets"".  Peppered with hilarious bons mots such as, ""When women go wrong, men go right after them"", the script, which she wrote herself, contains more wit in each scene than some modern so-called comedies have in a whole movie.  For a film that runs a mere 62 minutes, it's packed with fun, drama, wonderful period atmosphere and great performances from an ensemble cast, many of whom appeared in the stage version.  Mae's sultry singing of the song, ""A Guy What Takes His Time"" was so suggestive that the censors removed all but one verse of it from her filmed rendition, although she managed somehow to simultaneously release it on a 78 record that contained verse after verse of uncensored, ribald, raw sexuality.

While I am thrilled to finally have this movie available on DVD, it dashes my hopes that some of Mae West's more obscure films will ever find a digital release.

Universal Studios (who owns the rights to all Paramount titles) previously released on individual DVD's only three Mae West classic titles: I'm No Angel (1933), Belle of the Nineties (1934), and Klondike Annie (1937).  Each of these early DVD releases has been long out of print.  Early in 2005, My Little Chickadee (1940) was released as part of the W. C. Fields collection, and later that year, Universal released five titles in the ""Mae West Glamour Collection"", Night After Night (1932), Go West, Young Man (1935), Goin' To Town (1936) and the previously mentioned I'm No Angel and My Little Chickadee.  I was hoping that a ""Mae West Glamour Collection, Volume Two"" would eventually contain the out-of-print Belle of the Nineties and Klondike Annie, along with She Done Him Wrong, and her remaining two classic films, Every Day's A Holiday (1937) and the rarely seen, The Heat's On (1943), both of which have never been on DVD at all.  Curiously enough, the UK version of the Mae West Classic Collection included The Heat's On, although it was originally released by Columbia; I guess this means that Universal does have the rights.  BUT, the release of She Done Him Wrong as a single DVD has now dashed my hopes that the other classic titles will ever be released.  This is a pity.  Some critics - and I concur - consider Klondike Annie (more of a drama than a comedy) to be Mae's finest effort, and Every Day's A Holiday is one of her more hilarious outings on celluloid.

I am hoping against hope that this release signals the forthcoming issue of the few of Mae West's classics that have not been seen in a digital format, but only time will tell.",1200614400,52,3573,4.6864

265997,5,6300186016,"She Done Him Wrong showcases Mae West's fantastic talent as a seductive actress; she plays Lady Lou in a New York saloon where the men come to drink beer and fight over her. Cary Grant plays Captain Cummings from the mission next door; and the list of men who want time with Lady Lou is long enough to fill a phone book! The action moves along at a good pace with a few plot twists and unexpected surprises; this is one of Mae West's better films.

The action begins in the saloon where Lady Lou sings and has her home with Gus Jordan (Noah Beery) whose protection she gets while her former boyfriend Chick Clark (Owen Moore) does time in jail. Chick thinks Lou is being faithful to him while he is in jail; but the truth is anything but that. Lou fools around with Gus Jordan and gets chased by both Dan Flynn (David Landau) and Serge Stanieff (Gilbert Roland), all the while wanting to spend some time alone with Captain Cummings (Cary Grant) from the mission next door.

Lady Lou sings three songs in this film including ""A Guy What Takes His Time;"" but that's not why you want to watch this film. Watch this film for the zesty one liners from Lady Lou and her interactions with the numerous men in her life including Captain Cummings. Awesome! Look also for a solid performance by Louise Beavers as Lady Lou's maid Pearl.

The choreography is great in the bar hall scenes and the cinematography works wonders especially in the scenes which involve panning the bar hall and the jail.

Whatever you do, DON'T miss this film. She Done Him Wrong provides you with action, laughs, terrific one liners from West and a musical number or two when West warbles her way through a song. It seems so odd that this film, considered relatively tame by today's standards, was essentially the final straw that started the motion picture Production Code; but those were much different times.

West plays Lady Lou, a saloon singer who wears low cut, form-fitting gowns and drips with glittering diamonds. A woman who becomes the object of desire for every person of the opposite sex. A gold-digger with a shady past and a heart of gold.

Mae was almost 40 when she made this film and it's apparent in some (if not most) of her scenes. But despite all of her physical shortcomings, she still manages to convince some of us of her sexual expertise. It's all in her mannerisms, her ""purr"" and her stroll. The woman just oozes sex and her over-sized, hour glass figure in some scenes is spectacular. As one critic stated she is ""the BIG BEN of hour glass figures"".

This beloved classic offer's some of her best one-liners ever and some of the smartest dialoge to ever grace the silver screen. A scene that comes to mind is when Lady Lou comes to the aid of a young lady who tried to kill herself, West asks:

""What's wrong...commited murder?""

GIRL: ""No and I never will.""

MAE: ""Well you've got nothing to worry about. At least the guys alive.""

GIRL: ""How did you know there was a man?""

MAE: ""There always is. You know it takes two to get one in trouble.""

GIRL: ""You know everything about me.""

MAE: ""I wouldn't say that but I am observant..... what was he, married?.""

GIRL: ""Yes but I didn't know... I didn't know.""

MAE: ""It makes no difference to me whether you did or not. It's their game. I just happen to be smart enough to play it their way. You'll come to it.""

A bit later on the young girl asks:  ""Who'd want me after what I've done?"".

To which West replies: ""When woman go wrong men go right after them.""

Another classic moment is when West's maid states: "" ...if something were to happen, I wouldn't want no policeman to catch me without no petticoats."" To which West says: ""No policeman, how about a nice fireman?"".

This film was actually considered ""pornographic"" by some at the time. The only thing sexual about the film is Mae West's appearance and of course, her innuendos. It is a shame that many of her films were heavily edited and some of her best one-liner's were left on the cutting room floor.

This was West's first starring feature and it's one of her best. It's ""larger-than -life"" star steals the show and those who have not seen this classic are sure missing out.

So do yourselves a favour and ""go up and see her"". She'll make it worth your while.",1122940800,6,2499,4.41703056768559
265999,4,6300186016,"Mae West wrote and starred in this picture, based on her Broadway hit play DIAMOND LIL. She plays a nightclub singer and gal-about-town who collects men and the diamonds they give her like others collect stamps. But then she falls for the head of the mission next door (played by Cary Grant), who tells her diamonds have no soul. Considered by most a classic screen comedy, it's not rolling-in-the-aisle hilarious, but pretty funny nonetheless. This is the one where West tells Grant to ""come up and see me sometime,"" and in which she sings EASY RIDER and FRANKIE AND JOHNNY. Another good exchange:

Man to West: I've heard a lot about you.

West: Yeah, but you can't prove any of it.

""She Done Him Wrong"", a 1933 Mae West film is the answer. Her co-star, Cary Grant is descending some stairs, when she looks and utters the words, ""The lady is gaga"", smitten by his good looks. Her character is named ""Lady Lou"". Interestingly Lady Gaga borrowed quite heavily from this film, employing West's use of long gowns and platform shoes to enhance her height. West would also stand on boxes in close-ups with Grant, to appear taller. Of course, West's scandalous use of sexual innuendo, seen as a form of female empowerment, has also been freely employed by Gaga throughout her career.
