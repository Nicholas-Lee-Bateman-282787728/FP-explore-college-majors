8063656,5,B0009NXWG2,"These titles, put out by Critics Choice Videos, appear to be the prints TCM has shown in recent years of 14 of the 21 Leo Gorcey East Side Kids movies in the series. They are the cleanest I have seen to date. They consist of film releases 1 through 13 in the series plus the 15th release Million Dollar Kid (1944). As to the remaining 7 titles (Mr. Muggs Steps Out (1943)-- Follow the Leader (1944) -- Block Busters (1944) -- Bowery Champs (1944) -- Docks of New York (1945) -- Mr. Muggs Rides Again (1945) -- Come Out Fighting (1945)), I have not seen these available on dvd. I don't know why whoever has access to the series hasn't made these 7 titles available. If you love the East Side Kids films, these Critics Choice editions would be the ones I would recommend.",1294790400,2,769,4.347222222222222
