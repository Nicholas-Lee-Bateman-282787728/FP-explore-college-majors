525267,4,6302969697,"I'm not sure that it is helpful knowing that George Lucas found inspiration for his ""Star Wars"" films in Kurosawa's historical epic, ""The Hidden Fortress"" (1958). Oh, there are a number of matters of content that seem quite similar. Though Kurosawa's story takes place in sixteenth century Japan and Lucas sets his in space in the future, the basic struggles are the same-the restoration of power to a princess and her clan. Some would compare Toshiro Mifune's General Rokurota Makabe to Harrison Ford's Hans Solo in ""Star Wars"" (1977), though there may be more  commonality shared with Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker. And the two peasant farmers, pawns in the turmoil of sixteenth century Japanese civil wars, are easily identified as precursors of the ""Star Wars"" droids, R2-D2 and C3PO.  However, when all is said and done, the comparisons are only superficial. It may be more constructive to note some aspects of humor and character that are utilized in general. Kurosawa has always been willing to develop exaggerated characters. The peasant farmers, with their quick shifts between cowardice, bickering , and thievery are good examples of this. Certainly the first two of these traits were incorporated in the character of C3PO (the mechanical humanoid), but R2-D2 shows none of these characteristics. There is, however, an overall sense of humor that permeates both ""The Hidden Fortress"" and the ""Star Wars"" films-as well as a strong sense of nobility in the central characters, Rokurota and Skywalker.  That said, ""The Hidden Fortress"" seems to me to have clearly been made by a superior filmmaker. Both are good at telling the story. The ""Star Wars"" films rely heavily on special effects, to the extent, I think, that these are the central features of the films. ""The Hidden Fortress,"" while a relatively light weight work for Kurosawa, involves much more subtle character development achieved by means of acting skill revealed through visual compostion and unenhanced camera work.  This was Kurosawa's first use of Tohoscope, a Japanese widescreen process. And he uses the screen frequently to develop character. Over and over again he uses the wide screen to develop and reveal character. The peasant farmers are certainly more complex than the droids, though they are simplistically exaggerated. Kurosawa chose to explore the situation of these piteous beings, buffeted about in the feudal wars of sixteenth century Japan, in visually reinforced  wide screen long shots in those final scenes on the plains.  The code of the samurai is central to an understanding of ""The Seven Samurai"" (1954), ""Yojimbo"" (1961), and ""Sanjuro"" (1962), and even ""Rashomon"" (1954). These are all great films centered around the samurai class in Japan's past. From the ninth century, samurai warriors followed a strict code of ethical behavior known as ""bushido,"" which remained orally transmitted for generations. Briefly it is a way of life in which the warrior's honor and purpose are tied closely to the needs of his master. In this respect, he was to be selfless. His was not to understand or concern himself with politics-only to defend with honor the family or clan he served. For such a man the ideal was to be without fear-to always move forward in his employer's interest-without fear of death-only fear of dishonor. Toshiro Mifune's character in ""The Hidden Fortress"" is a military general, but his devotion to the creed and to his princess can be explained relative to this code. His daring, too, extends from that. So, too, his reputation reflects  that of an accomplished samurai. An especially strong scene in this regard is the duel scene in which Rokurota's skill and bravery are what are prized and respected by his opponent.  Above all, The Hidden Fortress remains a great adventure permeated with humor and nobility. While the force in the ""Star Wars"" sense is never mentioned, it remains a tacit part of  Rokurota's nobility.",989020800,23,3935,5.126365054602184
525268,5,6302969697,"...although you can hardly see the influence.  There exists 2 comical farmers thrown into adventures against their will, or two great swordsmen who duel in a show of skill and honor.  There is a chase through a gigantic fortress (basically an entire country!) in disguise to rescue a princess.
Amazingly enough, Akira Kurosawa created the plot for Hidden Fortress by simply asking his crew to create some interesting characters, then come up with strange adventures for them to go through.  The result is a masterpiece.  Kurosawa draws more humanity from simply 5 minute stories than most 90 minute movies!  Plenty of action, great dialog, and amazing acting all make for one of my favorite movies.  Time to buy another copy, because I've worn out my first!",977961600,14,757,4.968253968253968
525269,5,6302969697,"The VHS from Home Vision is supposed to be in widescreen format, yet I do  not understand why it is still not in the original aspect ratio of the  film.
The picture is ""cut off"" at the edges - clearly evident  in the opening credits where the Japanese names on the left and right are  partially covered. Such disregard results in scenes of 'half-bodied'  characters on the left and right edges of the frame, especially in many  compositions of the two farmers.
The same mis-treatment happened to 'Ran'  from Fox Lorber; and I thought Home Vision's productions would be fine as  earlier I saw its 'Yojimbo' and found no problems with its widescreen  presentation. I hope Home Vision would care to comment.
Despite the flaw,  I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It is a finely-judged balance of serious  adventure and light-hearted satire at the same time. Kurosawa achieved and  sustained the contrasts in the film at several levels, most of which are  flashed out through the film's main characters with beguiling effect.
If,  somehow, you have been put off by the pessimism and darkness of many of  Kurosawa's films, this is the film that would make the difference. By the  end of it, it is hard not to have on your face a smile that can come only  from a most satisfying and heartwarming experience.
Exciting,  entertaining and enchanting, the film actually suprises with its economy  and simplicity. It is yet another lesson from the master to other  film-makers on how good story-telling alone can carry a film to the height  of great entertainment without the indiscriminate resort to special effects  and gross sensationalism that Hollywood is so fond of.",968716800,,1656,4.860215053763441
525270,5,6302969697,"I often wondered about my taste in men when after seeing Star Wars I found myself favoring Darth Vader over the heroes.  Darth seemed the quintessential general, CEO, or any other take charge kind of guy, while  the heroes seemed like bumpkins.  Hidden Fortress is reputed to have been  Lukas' prototype for Star Wars, and after seeing the former, I now know why  I felt as I did about the latter!  In fact Darth Vader is the hero in  Hidden Fortress, facing staggering odds with only his own courage and  generalship to carry the day. And the bumpkins are in fact bumpkins!  A  fun film to see, especially if you are a Star Wars fan, but even if you're  not.  This film is not a sci-fi epic but a period piece set in Japan's  heroic past.  The director's feeling for cinematography is evident here as  in Throne of Blood, although for shear visual beauty, the latter is by far  the better of the two.",956016000,6,901,4.402439024390244
525271,5,6302969697,"Until George Lucas cited this movie as one of the main influences for ""Star Wars"", it probably would have been remembered as one of Kurosawa's forgotten masterpieces--not as revolutionary as  ""Roshomon"", not as edgy as ""Throne Of Blood"", not as  epic as ""Ran"".  Fortunately, we have this film in public  consciousness today and we are better off for it.  The movie is remarkably  restrained for all the action that goes on in it.  Toshiro Mifune is at the  top of his game as the samurai who must protect his princess during  precarious situations.  Kurosawa's direction is quite honestly sublime,  particularly in his direction of Mifune (as usual), the two bumbling  thieves who must assist him more out of desperation than devotion to his  princess, and in particular his handling of the sword-fighting scene about 2/3 into the picture.  It is striking due to the flashy action  that does NOT happen--everything is in the body language of the actors, and it is great stuff.

525289,5,6302969697,"Released in 1958, Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is an action-adventure in the age of the samurai. As the film opens, two buffoonish peasants, Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara) are heading home after failing to make a living as merceneries. Dramatic events have happened in their region: the Yamana clan has laid waste to the lands of the Akizuki clan. Only the Akizuki princess, Yuki (Misa Uehara) and her clan's dashing general Rokurota (Toshiro Mifune) have managed to escape, hiding out in the hidden fortress of the title, but the Yamana have put out a large reward for their capture. As General Rokurota and Princess Yuki set off from their refuge for the safe territory of an allied clan, the general enlists Tahei and Matashichi to help and carry their loads. The film is richly comedic, as the peasants are oblivious to the identity of their boss and his lady, and they are continually led astray from the escape plan by their greed, but Rokurota always finds a way to make their foolishness work to his and the princess's advantage.

In many respects, this is the closest of Kurosawa's films to the 1950s big-budget ""Hollywood movie"". It is an extravangaza shot in Cinemascope with amazing stunts on horseback, a dramatic fight scene between the hero and a village, and a riotous village dance at festival time. It is easy to see why the film was such a smash success in Japan and abroad. Don't think this is any commercial sellout, though, as THE HIDDEN FORTRESS maintains all the strengths of Kurosawa's work in this period, with believable, nuanced characterization, innovative camera techniques, and dramatic samurai clashes that show an awareness of American Westerns.

The acting in particular is incredible: Toshiro Mifune shows a perfect confidence in his role and his great versatility where he could be stern and severe one moment, maniacally laughing the next. Both of the peasants are hilarious, and while Kamatari Fujiwara was long known as a comedic actor, Minoru Chiaki here shows a different side than in earlier Kurosawa films. Surprisingly, Princess Yuki is mainly in the background; her appearance on film posters or DVD boxes might lead you to expect a prominent role and maybe some daring action sequences from her (she is said to be a tomboy, after all), but mainly she plays only a supporting character serving as a social critique of Japanese rulers, and the bulk of the story plays out between Rokurota and the peasants. Misa Uehara is a seductive screen presence in the bits she has, though, and it is perhaps a loss to cinema that she retired from her brief acting career soon after.

While THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is perhaps not as ""deep"" or psychologically intense as certain other Kurosawa films (such as THRONE OF BLOOD), this is an all-around great movie, a heck of a lot of fun for any casual view, and full of filmmaking details that cinema anoraks can chew on. I would generally recommend it to all and sundry.

The obligatory George Lucas mention: Kurosawa served as a light inspiration for STAR WARS, namely showing much of the action from the viewpoint of the lowliest characters. However, except for that feature, there aren't many similiarities between Kurosawa's film and that later science-fiction blockbuster; Lucas's championing of the film is a good thing inasmuch as it might bring Kurosawa to a wider audience, but it has the downside of perhaps prejudicing one's expectations.",1503100800,,3459,4.9689119170984455
525290,4,6302969697,"Part of what makes Akira Kurosawas Hidden Fortress fun for me is pealing apart various threads. I am not sure that it is great cinema but it stands as a period piece, a fun flick and a stand out vehicle for Toshiro Mifune. Allowing for a fairly small amount of stylized violence it is family friendly and an acknowledged moment in the history of film making.

To begin with; the Star Wars connection. The several attached special features include a very telling moment where a visibly sensitive George Lucas bristles at the notion that his use of Hidden Fortress extended beyond the convention of using two minor characters to be the center of the narrative. Several other things seem clearly part of Mr. Lucass take away. The opening scene with the arrival from lower left of a troop of Imperials who cut down an escaping Samurai warrior looks a lot like the hi-tech arrival of the Star Destroyer. The Princess Warrior matchup also seems more than coincidence, and Kurosawas peasant fools, Tehei and Matashichi are ringers for the later shiny droids. Mever mind because Kurosawa was not making a movie for the purpose of Inspiring George Lucas and  the older movie should only be appreciated for what it was intended to be.
Also of interest and made clear by the extras is that Kurosawa intended from the beginning to make a Samuri period, Japanese western. His use of horses was driven literally by his appreciation of how particularly John Ford used horses in Westerns. Other sources will class Hidden Fortress as a road picture, but again, the included extras point to the American Cowboy movies. Kurosawa invented some new techniques in camera work in order to achieve some seamless effects. The great chase scene is one of the great moments in this movie and not by accident or by the director coping long proven uses of cameras and splicing. Looked at from its intention to be a Cowboy movie it is worth noting that Hidden Fortress was initially criticized for its non-Japanese character, until it began to receive foreign recognition.

From the POV of the movie as entertainment. In the opening two forlorn villagers are seen escaping from a battle where they had been baking on making their fortune in war booty. Instead they are down to rags, hungry and fighting over who is uglier. These two are bumbling fools in the Abbot and Costello mode. Minoru Chiaki as Tahei and Kamatari Fujiwara as Matashichi give strong performances of weak and untrustworthy fools. They fall in with a famous warrior, Tushiro Mifume as General Rokurao Makabe , a hoard of gold bars and the princes from the recently defeated clan Misa Shimura as Princes Yuki. Their combine goal is to avoid the victorious army and seek sanctuary with a nearby, friendly and intact clan.
Mifume mostly owns this movie. His physical presence insures he can own his every scene. He did many of his own stunts, which required him to perform some wonderful horsemanship. This was a first movie for Shimura. Perhaps for this reason her role is mostly one of striking exaggerated fierce looking possess and not much else.

To complete my criticisms, there is a scene where our general rides into an enemy camp, challenges an old friend/enemy to a duel, wins and rides away. It struck me as forced in and the escape is less than credible. Also the clowning peasants are never reliable, loyal or noble, except towards each other. At some point I wondered why they were tolerated. Perhaps this was a typical aspect of1950s Japanese film stock characters.
Hidden Fortress is not intended to be deep or philosophical or symbolic. This is a Saturday Matinee movie for the family. In this it succeeds. Kurosawa deserves credit for advancing the technical tool kit for movie making. The connoisseurs insist that this is an example of great movie making. I think it succeeds as entertainment, shows a young Mifume as a fine actor and provides things for viewers to talk about, whether intended by the director or inspirational to George Lucas.",1501459200,2,4000,4.835036496350365

525307,5,6302969697,"I thought I had seen the most cinematically brilliant movie of all time, The Seven Samurai, but Akira Kurosawa topped himself with this beautifully filmed cinematic masterpiece. This movie really is the Star Wars story told in Japanese interpretation. A princess(think Princess Leia) and a cache of gold(Death Star plans) are being smuggled out of enemy territory and to the homeland of a defeated clan of which this princess is a member of. Then you have two bumbling thieves(R2-D2 and C-3PO) who stumble into the situation and plan to take the gold for themselves and/or turn the princess in to get rich. What follows is an adventure that is riveting for the entire 112 minutes of the movie. Nearly every Star Wars character is in this Lando Calrissian, Obi Wan Kenobi and I think even a Han Solo-like Samurai character that our thieves meet in the forest. The movie has a mixture of comedy, romance, and action. Mifune is in top form as an old advisor to the princess, apparently the inspiration for Obi Wan Kenobi.

Close ups are rare (unlike the current crop of tent-pole films that use quick-cut extreme close-ups to simulate action to the point of nausea).  Kurosawa fills the wide screen down to the square centimeter (one of his directorial trademarks).  The video restoration is flawless.  Not so much so for the audio restoration which contains occasional distortions.  Film score is so-so, adding to the impact of some scenes, distracting from others.  Subtitles are perfunctory and skip over some subtle and some not so subtle nuances.  Costumes are, well, interesting.  Cant help but wonder how many young women publicly wore rather short shorts and tight blouses in feudal Japan!  Or how extremely rugged terrain was navigated by folks wearing only sandals!  Now to the story line, script, and acting.  This film cries out for a Directors Cut version (or at least the outtakes), as many scenes are disjointed and abrupt with characters conveying information either gained from telepathy or by viewing the dailies!  As for the story line, its predicable and lame. Acting is uneven: two characters (used to stitch scenes together and provide marginal comic relief) are allowed to outrageously ham it up; the leading actress (Misa Uehara) plays scenes in a state of sustained hysteria (except when playing a deaf mute); and the leading actor (Toshiro Mifune) essentially plays a supporting role (except for some action scenes) to the two-character scene-stitchers.

525509,5,6302969697,"Recently my husband and I were able to watch Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS on TV, and I found myself once again entranced by this delightful tale.

I've seen it perhaps 5 times in my life.  The first time was in a revival theater, the Valley Art.  I was around 19 years old, and the other people in the audience were mostly college students.  As much as I liked seeing it on my 28-inch screen at home, it's a powerful experience on the big screen - so much so that, although the movie was filmed in black & white, I remember parts of it in color.  Most of it was filmed at real, outdoor locations, but I suspect parts were filmed in a studio, on lovingly detailed sets.  Cecil B. DeMille's got nothing on Kurosawa when it comes to gorgeous spectacle.  Another thing that impresses me is the number of extras in the movie.  It doesn't boast ""a cast of thousands,"" but there are sometimes a few hundred people on the screen, yet the main characters never get lost in all that action.

The big star in the film is Toshiro Mifune, who plays the stoic samurai character, General Rokurota Makabe, with aplomb.  When he wears a mustache and beard, he looks just like the paintings of samurai on silk screens, or like the masks in Japanese theater.  He's wonderful, but he's made more so by the character who steals the movie: Princess Yuki.  She is the reason I keep wanting to see this movie.  She is extraordinarily beautiful, as you pretty much expect a princess to be, but it's actually her imperious-yet-socially-awkward personality that steals my heart.  She is the only child of Lord Akizuki, and the sole survivor from an old and noble family.  Because she had no brother, her father raised her to lead the clan.  She is fearless and utterly imperial, well-trained in the art of giving orders that must be obeyed.  These are traits that inspire devotion and unquestioning loyalty in the handful of servants that survived the massacre of her kin.  She accepts this loyalty.  But she is compassionate too - a trait she must wrestle with if she wants to re-establish her clan.

You might think Yuki and Rokurota are the glue that hold this movie together, but that distinction goes to a couple of viewpoint characters, the comical (but not always likeable) Tahei and Matashichi, a couple of peasants who went to war in order to get rich.  This is not a scheme that works out for them, and things go from bad to worse in the first five minutes of the film.  From that point forward, these two knuckleheads fall into one disaster after another.  Their own greed and moral ambiguities drive them to keep making mistakes, but those are the traits Rokurota finds the most useful as he tricks them into helping him and Yuki move the gold that belongs to the shattered Clan Akizuki to safety.

Along the way, Yuki insists on rescuing a slave girl, an act of compassion that seems too soft-hearted at first, until this same girl manages to save the day several times.  Can this band of misfits get the gold to safety so Yuki can rebuild her clan?  The odds are stacked against them, but they still have some tricks up their sleeves.

Each time I watch this movie, I notice something different.  This time it was the fact that the hidden fortress sits in the middle of an odd and other-worldly deposit of what appears to be volcanic tuff.  I can't help wondering if this site survives intact in modern Japan.  I hope it does.  It was part of the magic of this movie, one detail in a long list of wondrous sights and sounds.

I love The Hidden Fortress.  Princess Yuki has won my devotion, too.",1356307200,6,3589,4.523291925465839
525510,3,6302969697,"This came very quickly from the seller and it took me a couple of months to get to watch it.  I liked the movie.  The director does a nice job with his films.  Good characters and a rather long plot development with a odd ending.  Any way, I was told this was one of the movies that George Lucas took some things from in making Star Wars (the original movie).  Sure there is a princess, but there isn't much else that would lead me to think that it had anything to do with Star Wars.  If the two guys that were the comic relief were supposed to be like the droids, then why were they always acting as traitors?  They were not remotely like that in Star Wars.

525534,5,6302969697,"Not only is this the movie that made me appreciate Kurosawa (my first viewing of Seven Samurai left me disappointed, though I like it a lot more now), but I can't think of many movies that made me laugh as hard as this one. All you Star Wars fans need to watch this (and The Searchers) to see where George Lucas stole (uh, I mean borrowed, yeah...) his ideas. C3PO, R2D2, Princess Leia, Han Solo, the Empire, it's all here (Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are in The Searchers).

This movie is probably the best use of 2.35:1 photography I've ever seen, and a director has to be extra good for me to like that wide of a ratio. Watch the scene when the our two peasants are complaining about digging a pit, the camera follows them perfectly as they walk on either side. Or the scene when they get lost in a crowd and spot eachother. Not once does Kurosawa seem to be using the wide ratio to impress us or create an artificial sense of grandeur.

I recommend the Criterion DVD, the picture is very sharp and the contrast is perfect (I've never seen this theatrically, so I can't vouch for its accuracy, but it looks good).",1290988800,2,1119,4.349282296650718
525535,5,6302969697,"In a word, Yes.

This does for Star Wars what 'Yojimbo' did for Clint Eastwood - give it inspiration. Ok, Star Wars is not a direct rip-off of this like 'Fist Full of Dollars' is from 'Yojimbo', but the story is told primarily about a Princess who must travel thru' enemy territory to get back to her Province...sounds like Princess Leiha, huh? This movie is set in what appears to be the early days of the Sengoku period as there are a lot of minor Daimyo to contend with. The story resembles 'Star Wars' as well in that it is told primarily from the viewpoint of the two hopeless/useless peasants who get drafted in to help the Princess get back home...sounds like C3PO & R2, huh?

Also, this is without a doubt my favorite role for Mifune, who plays General Rokota. Yes, we know he's best known for 'Yojimbo' (the man with no name), and also for his portrayal of Miyamoto Musashi in the 3-part series 'Samurai', and everything he did was awesome, but this is his role!

Another interesting thinga about this movie: Young Uehara Misa, who plays the Princess, and looks good running around in short shorts (a terrible thing to think seeing as it was made in 1960!) pretty much retired straight after filming this...very sad. I don't know why, but there you go....",1289260800,,1264,4.559471365638767

525537,5,6302969697,"Kurosawa's mastery is prevalent in every shot of this great Japanese epic that concentrates more on the characters and their development than on the battle scenes, though when they do occur, those are great also.
It is hard to believe so many masterpieces can be made by the same person: I was very familiar with the others ""Throne of Blood"" is the best interpretation fo Macbeth I have ever yet seen. ""Roshomon"" and ""Seven Samurai"" either one of which would have provided a director with immortality and then on top of that there is this wonderful psychological work. This is a less known, but no less great work.
Toshiro Mifume is at his best as the fearless general Rokurota Makabe, his performance plays off the strong, silent personnality of the persecuted princess Yuki (Misa Uehara) who is the center point of the film. Her clan has been exterminated by war and only she has survived. Together with the general she has to transport the gold treasury of her clan across the enemy territory. It is a saga of danger, thrilling bluffing schemes, subtle deception and intense drama.
Minoru Chiaki as Tahei and Kamatari Fujiwara as Matakishi are extremely well suited to carry on with each other as the two stubborn, ambitious peasants that go through hell and back to get some of that gold for themselves. they are also the comic relief in this tense thriller, action packed samurai tale that also slows down ocassionally to unveil the beauties of nature in a uniquely expressive manner that is typical Kurosawa.
Please note: In the extras there is a section on awards and you will see that, like many true greats, he never won an Oscar, though he had a ""lifetime"" achievement award in 1990.",1250467200,,1693,4.761904761904762
525538,5,6302969697,"I have to write this review because few, if any, reviewers seem to know what the hiden fortress is, what the film is all about. The film is about duty to a larger cause, that is the hidden fortress of strength we have. THe alternative is to be greedy and small-minded, like the peasants.
This symbollism is played out over and over again in the film. For instance, in the beginning, the peasants have to climb up a rocky incline with great difficulty, but Rokurota knows a secret passageway that is much easier. This symbollizes the powerlessness of people who don't serve a higher cause, and the magic doors that open when you do.
Finally, Rokurota and the princess are seen in their secular splendor. But their attainment was always there, even as beggars.",1246233600,8,758,4.664179104477612
525539,5,6302969697,"I can't tell you the number of times I meet intelligent adults who ask me for a movie recommendation. When I suggest a foreign film ...they say,  ""subtitles, that's not for me.""  For those men and women, the one film that I ask them to see is Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress.""  There are precious few who have not returned and told me they loved it.

To be blunt, I consider it every bit a great film as Kurosawa's boldest achievements...including ""Ran"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Red Beard"", or ""Ikiru."" I did not always harbor this opinion, but on my seventh viewing, I gasped at the absolute perfection of the thing.

The storyline is relatively straightforward.  A princess of a defeated clan and her warrior general need to escape  a ring of enemy soldiers into safe territory, And they need to bring with them a treasure trove of gold sticks.  As it turns out, they must (reluctantly) use the services of two bumbling, greedy peasants to carry the gold, hidden in larger sticks of wood. And the two peasants agree to do this, thirsting and bickering and plotting about the treasure.

""The Hidden Fortress""  stars Toshiro Mifune as the powerful warrior samurai.  But here's the catch...it is actually the two clownish peasants, played with comic genius - Minoru Chiaki and Kamarari Fujiwara - who overshadow Toshiro Mifune.  Yes, they actually do.  Those actors are such endearing fools; one's eyes are constantly upon them.

The film, like so many of Kurosawa's movies, is about personal transformation.  Both the princess and the fools learn much about their odyssey through enemy territory, guided by the wise, loyal samurai general.

And I simply can't say enough about the brilliant cinematography and excellent use of music.  They are the equal of Kurosawa's other black and white epics.

There is one scene, above all, that sticks in my mind.  When the two bumbling peasants, along with hundreds of other unfortunates, are thrown into a pit to dig for gold by the enemy solders, the entire group of
slaves revolt against the soldiers and run free. Some die...some escape.
As a child of parents who had to escape the Nazi holocaust, the courage of the oppressed ones rushing to freedom, overpowering the fewer number of soldiers, reminded me of the few instances where concentration camp inmates courageously tried the same thing.

This is a magnificent film...of what it means to overcome petty greed and jealousy.  But it is also ""100% entertainment"", as Akira Kurosawa expressed it.  ""The Hidden Fortress"" is a model of what can be done in the genre of comedy-adventure. An absolute masterpiece.",1242950400,4,2607,4.931192660550459

525543,3,6302969697,"Those film viewers who equate foreign films with pretense need to sit down for a couple of hours and watch director Akira Kurosawa's first widescreen (Tohoscope) film, the black and white The Hidden Fortress (Kakushi-Toride No San-Akunin- literally The Three Villains Of The Hidden Fortress), from 1958. While it is a very good film, it is a great movie- in the feel good sense of the term. Filmmaker George Lucas claims this film was the inspiration for his third rate Star Wars films. Yes, there are a handful of similarities, but `influence' is usually used when a great work of art is influenced by an equal or lesser work of art, not when bad art rips off greater art. In short, influence occurs in evolution, not devolution, and Lucas's claims bear the stench of a lesser artist trying to parasitically sponge off a greater artist's reputation.
  The Hidden Fortress runs 139 minutes, but it never slows down nor gets boring. It is action and humor nonstop, and Kurosawa reputedly only made the film to repay Toho Studios for allowing him to make riskier, more artistic films like Ikiru and Rashomon. In many ways, even though the film stars the great Toshir Mifune, as General Rokurota Makabe, a role that is quite reserved in comparison to his other roles in period films- or jidai-geki (from where Lucas got the term Jedi), the film's narrative and heart belong to the two peasant farmer fools, tubby Tahei (Minoru Chiaki- the good natured samurai from Seven Samurai) and tiny Matakishi (Kamatari Fujiwara- the farmer Manzo from Seven Samurai), who make a terrific comedy team- far better than their supposed Star Wars stand-ins, R2D2 and C3PO. This duo not only get the most screen time, but the tale is basically from their point of view, and the viewer roots for them, despite their greed and stupidity constantly endangering them; whereas the more conventional tale of the Princess and her General is backgrounded and rather rote....  Fortunately, the occasional anachronism is about the only thing wrong with the tale, for The Hidden Fortress is a great adventure movie, as well as very funny. That said, I can state with the utmost seriousness that I know Akira Kurosawa. Akira Kurosawa is a friend of mine. And you, Mr. Lucas, are no Akira Kurosawa. Now, if only Tahei and Matakishi were around to beat him, as he so richly deserves.",1221782400,2,2349,4.838308457711443
525564,5,6302969697,"The HIDDEN FORTRESS (1958, aka. Kakushi toride no san akunin) is Akira Kurosawa's first widescreen-shot film and the famed director uses it as if he has been a master of it for many years. In a period where warring clans in Japan, the film is all about loyalty, honor, greed and betrayal but the film is also the most well-spirited, fun-loving samurai adventure that Kurosawa had directed after ""Ran"" and ""Throne of Blood"". Think the ""Treasure of Sierra Madre"" collides with George Lucas' ""Star Wars""--without the Wookies, aliens, droids and spaceships.

Two bickering peasants named Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matshichi (Katamari Fujiwara), who gets caught up with provincial warfare between the Akizuki and Yamana clans. After escaping the clutches of the Yamana forces, the duo crosses paths with a stranger who calls himself Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune), a general of the Akizuki clan in hiding. The Akizuki province is currently being occupied by the Yamana clan and whose Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara) is the last surviving royalty of the defeated side. Makabe intends to sneak by enemy lines and flee to the neighboring Hayakawa province along with 200 pieces of gold. But to do so, he must convince the punchy pair that the ""plucky"" princess is his mute girlfriend.

Yes, this is the film that inspired ""Star Wars"" and George Lucas even repaid the inspiration that he had gotten from Kurosawa by investing in his 1980 film ""KAGEMUSHA"" (which I will review much later). Those who are expecting highly visible references to the sci-fi blockbuster may be a bit disappointed though. While there is a princess and the antics of the two peasants are quite comparable to R2-D2 and C3-PO; in this film, the tough princess remained so and the story somewhat revolves mostly around two underlings; Tahei and Matshichi. Yes, Toshiro Mifune has a lead role in the film but only as a major supporting character. But not to worry, the film is a terrific actioner and it is well directed. What else can you expect from Kurosawa?

The role of Princess Yuki was a nightmare to begin with. Kurosawa had gone through 200 actresses and he could not find the right girl. (Hence, the 200 pieces of gold was inspired) It was not until he caught sight of newcomer Misa Uehara that Kurosawa had found the perfect girl to play the princess raised as a boy. Kurosawa is such a perfectionist, it would take him several months, maybe even a year to begin a project. The director had also insisted Mifune to grow a real beard for many months even though it itched like crazy (in ""Red Beard""), this incident was believed to have ended the Mifune-Kurosawa collaborations. Their relationship had already become strained when Kurosawa questioned Mifune's acceptance of less than credible roles but the actor had to make a living and cannot wait for Kurosawa`s projects on several occasions.

The film is essentially a chase film and the bickering of Tahei and Matshichi (sometimes listed as Matakishi) gives the film a lot of depth. Their lust for riches and women are very entertaining all through the film's proceedings. The two would fight among themselves to gain advantage over the other but they would also be plotting with each other to gain advantage over others. The pathetic fools even considered the possibility of raping the princess. The two are pitiable lowlifes and they do give an unlikable impression to the audience but they are also necessary to represent the blacks and the whites and the shades of gray. Rokurota Makabe is a general and a superb warrior. Mifune's character is cunning, smart and determined to protect the princess at all costs that he manipulates the two lowlifes into helping them by using gold hidden in firewood as their motivation.

One thing with Toshiro Mifune, the man definitely has a strong presence onscreen. There is just something about him that is magnetic, commanding and energetic that would catch any audience's attention. The man is a marvelous actor and with Kurosawa at the helm, the actor definitely bears his soul for his character. Toho productions were so worried about Kurosawa Akira leaving their company after this film, that they agreed to help him form his own production company, and in turn take on some expenses of his projects. This is his first widescreen film but Kurosawa utilizes the wide frame to near perfection. The director manipulates the frame like a master whether the shots are mountain ranges or open vistas or fight sequences.

The film also has quite a lot of action. Highlights include a swordfight on horseback, and the film's main draw is the duel with spears between Makabe and Hyoe Tadokoro (played by Susumu Fujita). The fight is well choreographed and stays within the realm of realism. The fight is long and intense, and Tadokoro definitely shows that he is Makabe's equal in the use of a spear. I was also really impressed that for a movie at this time would be able to shoot a real good swordfight on horseback. Kurosawa definitely knows how to work his cameras.

""The Hidden Fortress"" is a true classic by Akira Kurosawa. There is just so much going on with this film; a cunning general, a beautiful princess, pathetic peasants that all complement its elements of intrigue, betrayal, honor and loyalty. The film is a drag-out action film that displays not only Kurosawa's genius but also his ability to exude charm and magnetism through his style. This film is Kurosawa's next box-office success after ""Seven Samurai"" and after this he once again hits gold with ""Yojimbo"".  The film is also a critical success garnering numerous film awards.

525566,5,6302969697,"According to film lore, director Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998) wished to make a distinctly commercial film for Toho Studios in order to thank the company for backing his earlier, riskier fare.  Considering that the fare in question, however, had generated at least major international hits, it would seem the studio had been already been thanked and then some.  No, I suspect that this story was put forth by Kurosawa fans who wanted to find a tangible reason for the fact that THE HIDDEN FORTRESS was not quite in the same league as such films RASHOMON, SEVEN SAMURAI, and THRONE OF BLOOD.  If so, they needn't have bothered.  It is true that THE HIDDEN FORTRESS lacks the same intense focus and the same visual power as Kurosawa's masterworks, but it is no less a fine film for that, and it should be judged on its own merits.

The story begins with two foolish peasants Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara) who squandered their savings to go to war--only to find themselves beset by both armies.  Having at last escaped, they discover a piece of gold belonging to the defeated army, begin to search for more, and fall into the hands of General Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune), who seeks to get both the gold and the only surviving ruler of his clan, Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara), out enemy territory.  Makabe decides he can make use of the peasants--and quite soon the party is underway, the gold cleverly concealed, the peasants really more hinderance than help, and the Princess every bit as strong willed as her general.

As you might expect from Kurosawa, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is a highly visual film, and indeed it contains sequences every bit as exciting as the best of his best.  The opening shots, which track the peasants across what seems to be a completely empty landscape that is suddenly disrupted by sudden death; the rebellion of the prisoners in the camp; the moments in which Princess Yuki explores a brothel; the fire dance--all offer Kurosawa's meticulous eye at its most penetrating.  The performances are excellent and the whole thing is extremely entertaining.

Most critical complaints about the film center on Chiaki and Fujiwara's performances as the peasants, and it is quite true that--to Western eyes at least--they seem excessive, almost as if two of the Three Stooges had been suddenly dropped into a Eugene O'Neill drama.  Ideas about comedy vary considerably from culture to culture, and this may be an instance in which we should chalk up the experience to evidence of that; even so, and although I found them occasionally wearing, they frequently manage to transcend the cultural barrier to become laugh-out-loud funny.

The Criterion DVD release is quite fine in terms of sound and picture and offers extremely legible subtitles.  The only ""bonus feature"" is an eight minute interview with George Lucas, who briefly discusses the influence of Kurosawa in general and THE HIDDEN FORTRESS in particular on his film STAR WARS.  The best I can say for the clip is that it has obviously been quite some time since Lucas saw THE HIDDEN FORTRESS; he seems oblivious to many of the parallels.  That said, quite frankly I find the comparison somewhat overblown.  THE HIDDEN FORTRESS does well enough on its own.

525569,4,6302969697,"George Lucas loosely based Star Wars on this movie. Don't take my word for it; he said that and more himself in an interview on this DVD.

The plot is simple: a princess needs to reach home to claim power and she carries the clan's gold bars, which without she won't be able to rule. She's accompanied by a loyal General to protect her while they're in disguise. Yet, that's not the interesting part; it's what happens throughout the journey.

The princess learns from people and about people. She experiences new things that other rulers don't usually get to experience. You get to see how people react to issues like greed, loyalty, duty and other qualities that are tested in many situations in the film.

Of course, it's another Japanese brilliant born-to-be-classic-film by akira kurosawa. And Toshir Mifune's graceful acting style grows on me every time I see more of his work. (See the Seven Samurai for a completely different role he plays and see Shogun for his acting at an older age).

Not all B&W classic films are well restored, but I trust Criterion Collection's efforts and standards. You won't be disappointed.

I gave it 4 stars because I felt the ending few scenes were too short compared to the rhythm of the entire film (and it's long, I warn you). But again, it's about the journey, not the destination.",1176249600,3,1324,4.714285714285714
525570,5,6302969697,"The Hidden Fortress is another of Akira Kurosawa's cinematic masterpieces.  This movie is a wonderful example of deep character development coupled with great direction and camera work.  As viewers, we are taken for a ride into old feudalist Japan with its' various class distinctions.  There are the peasant farmers, Tahei and Matakishi, who sold everything to go to war and end up penniless trying to survive.  There's the disguised general, Rokuruta Makabe (Toshiro Mifune), a samurai general protecting his charge the princess.  He must find a way of getting her and the gold across the enemies border to rebuild the empire.  Finally, there is the princess Yuki.  All the hopes of clan rest with her and the gold's successful escape to friendlier territories.  Along the way life's lessons are learned.  The princess moves from spoiled child to become a true princess ready to lead her clan.  The farmers come away far less greedy and much better friends.  Lastly, the word of the samurai is honored between two old antagonists.

Whether it is the camera shots...just watch the escape sequence as hundreds of extras come fighting down a staircase...or the story, this movie satisfies on many levels.  All good or smart directors borrow from each other.  The influence of John Ford can be seen in many areas and Lucas certainly borrowed from Kurosawa.

525571,4,6302969697,"There are about 100 things that this film did right and later directors have often taken advantage of this textbook on how to tell a great story in film.  I wouldn't call it Kurosawa's best because to me, the best films are all deep character studies and that really isn't the true strength of The Hidden Fortress.  To be honest, all the characters in this film are more caricatures and archetypes than deeply developed characters.  That's not to say it isn't well acted because it is.  But the fact is, all we know about bickering Tahei and Matakishi is that they're friends fleeing a war.  We get a good handle on their relationship, but not all that much about them individually.  General Rokurota is a veritable picture of nobility and imperious command, but we see little emotion from him.  The most engaging character, ironically, is Princess Yuki who is forbidden to speak for fear that her accent and tone would betray her rank.  Of course, even when silenced, her behavior is every bit the proud, haughty noblewoman.  The beauty of the film is how much of the story is advanced not by dialogue, but by small actions and movements and facial features.  In the end, I found myself deeply moved by the Princess' gradual understanding of the life of the humble peasants in her country and her determination to restore her family's kingdom.  Kurosawa does an amazing job of driving home these themes with a great deal of subtlety and not an excessive amount of dialogue.  I consider Yojimbo, The Seven Samurai, and Rashomon to be better flicks, all in all, but I think The Hidden Fortress is superb example of the filmmaker as storyteller.",1171929600,2,1643,4.726315789473684

525605,3,6302969697,"I love black & white movies!  It's a form of cinema that's becoming increasingly less appreciated as the years go by.  In fact, I like black & white movies so much that there are some contemporary films that I watch on DVD by switching off my TV set's color.  Yes, I'm just that nutty about monochrome!

Now, having waxed rhapsodic in various places about how one color film or another should have been made in black & white, I thought that I would give some equal time to the opposite: a monochrome film that might have been better in color.  Of course, for me, they're hard to find.  But I did come up with one: Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress,"" a film that could have easily been shot in TohoColor when it was made in 1958.

I've seen most of Kurosawa's films, and of the bunch, ""The Hidden Fortress"" is the least serious -- and maybe because of that, one of the least satisfying.  Now, substandard Kurosawa would still be better than the best of many directors that I can think of.  And if ""The Hidden Fortress"" were directed by any other pre-New Wave Japanese filmmaker, it would probably stand out as a rollicking good yarn.  But since this movie is by the same demanding director who gave the world ""Rashmon"" (1950), ""The Seven Samurai"" (1954), and ""High and Low"" (1963), its fluffiness is a wee bit disappointing.  Indeed, the only story element that sets ""The Hidden Fortress"" apart from a run-of-the-mill chambara (i.e., Japanese sword-fight movie) is its celebrated focus on two comical, selfish scavengers, played by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara, rather than on movie-star Toshiro Mifune's heroic incognito general.

Kurosawa is reported to have said that he wanted ""The Hidden Fortress"" to be a ""fairy tale,"" to be without the penetrating social criticisms that mark so many of his other works.  If this modest goal is what he set out to do, he achieved it.  But I think that the black & white cinematography lends the film a weight and seriousness that it neither warrants nor needs.  Color would have brought out the make-believe qualities of the story.  Polychrome photography would have lushly enhanced the spectacle of the village fire festival, the movie's centerpiece extravaganza.  And color would have certainly burnished the film's uncynical happy ending, an occurrence all too rare in a Kurosawa work.  If nothing else, it would just be nice to have a Kurosawa-Mifune collaboration in color.

But I know why ""The Hidden Fortress"" is in black & white.  Kurosawa didn't like the movies' various color processes back in the 1950s and early '60s, so he didn't make a color film until 1970's ""Dodes'kaden.""  Also, ""The Hidden Fortress"" was the director's first feature in a widescreen format (TohoScope), and it might have been unrealistic to ask him to master two technological changes at once (though I doubt it).  Besides, Kurosawa might have had a point: in black & white, ""The Hidden Fortress"" looks less dated than some of its chambara contemporaries do in color.

I'm not calling for ""The Hidden Fortress"" to be colorized (I regard colorizing movies as a kind of vandalism).  And I can't think of another Kurosawa black & white that I would want to want to see in color.  In fact, I tip my hat to the Japanese master for holding onto monochrome for as long as he did (I'm sure that he must have faced pressure from the studio higher-ups to shoot in color).  I'm particularly jazzed that his ""Yojimbo"" (1961) is in black & white: monochrome helps to bring out the story's hard-edged, noirish cynicism.  Also, it's worth mentioning that when Kurosawa eventually turned to color later in his career, when color reproduction on film finally met his demanding standards, he and his cinematographers employed it brilliantly.

While not premium Kurosawa, ""The Hidden Fortress"" is still worth checking out as a rental.  Although in black & white, it's a very colorful movie.",1156550400,8,3905,4.838855421686747
525606,5,6302969697,"""The Hidden Fortress,"" by Akira Kurosawa, is a light-hearted and entertaining film. The films narrative begins with two peasant warriors who give the film its comical and entertaining presence. Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matakishi (Kamatari Fujiwara) have had enough of the fighting that they have brought on themselves. Seeing that fighting battles is not  in any way glorious, or their road to fame and fortune, they decide to take off for home. This opportunity is afforded to them when an uprising occurs in a prison they are currently being held in. However, there are complications as the land is guarded by various warrior clans, and without the proper papers, there is no way they are going home.

However, luck will be on their side when they happen to run into General Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune). General Makabe has been entrusted with the care of the beautiful princess Yuki (Misa Uehara). Also, there is a large amount of gold that Makabe is also entrusted with, and along with the princess, he must get both to safety. Meanwhile, the two peasant warriors have decided [or at least it has been decided for them] to accompany Makabe and the princess to safety. But there is a rough road ahead of them. Moreover, how can they safely cross lands with the opposing side on the lookout for them? This is a classic Kurosawa black and white drama, comedy, and action-adventure all in one.

I am a great fan of Kurosawa, and although I do not see the parallels that many of the film critics do when comparing this film with ""Star Wars,"" I do understand that George Lucas was influenced greatly by this film when doing his own film. One more thing as a side note: The character who portrays Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) was also one of the seven samurai's in Kurosawa's great classic, ""The Seven Samurai."" Minoru Chiaki was in many great films, and he portrayed the good natured samurai Heihachi. Also, he was the last surviving samurai of that great classic up until his death in 1999. [Toshiro Mifune having died in 1997]. This is a fun film, and a worthwhile purchase. CRITERION as usual has done a splendid job with the transfer. The film will make a wonderful addition to your film library. Highly recommended.",1155513600,2,2216,4.765625
525607,5,6302969697,"Of all the directing masters Akira Kurosawa is arguably the greatest. No matter how much praise and hyperbole is shoveled onto his films they always surprise me by how good they are. Not good in a, ""this was phenomenal for the 1950's,"" but good as in, ""this is better than just about anything we're seeing today."" While watching this movie I was trying to think of an American director who even comes close, but no one quite matches Kurosawa. If Akira Kurosawa and Stanley Kubrick had a street fight in Heaven I gurantee you Kurosawa would kick Kubrick in the nuts and decapitate him inside of a minute.

This film is often described as the impetus for Star Wars. After seeing the prequel trilogy I half expected The Hidden Fortress to be an exact blueprint for Episode IV, but they're really not that similar. It turns out that George Lucas was talented back in the day. If you're looking for simularities you'll find them, but if Lucas himself hadn't mentioned how much this film influenced him I doubt anyone would be drawing parallels. For example, the two peasant characters, Tahei and Matakishi, are supposed to be the inpirations for R2-D2 and C-3PO, but they're not similar in the least. Tahei and Matakishi are slow, bumbling, greedy, and selfish. They're a far cry from Lucas' creations. R2-D2 is the butch in the relationship while C-3PO is his more feminine partner. (I have to give Lucas credit for having the guts to put a gay robot couple in a film way back in the 70's, and it's even more amazing because no one has had the guts to do it a second time. Perhaps one day gay robots will get the screen time they deserve.)

The story involves a princess and her general who are trapped behind enemy lines and must make it back to their own land. Of all the Kurosawa films I've seen this is the most commercial, and should satisfy fans of old action and adventure. Of particular interest is Toshiro Mifune who is a Kurosawa regular. He plays General Rokurota - an all around badass. When his party gets stopped by soldiers trying to hunt them down he quickly kills a couple of them, and then grabs a horse to go hunt down the two trying to escape, all the while letting out a warrior's cry. This action sequence ends in a duel between Rokurota and an opposing general he has a competitive but friendly relationship with. The duel is one of the greatest fight scenes in cinema, and not just because of the fine choreography (although that too), but because of how interesting these two characters are. They respect each other, but if they met on a battlefield then duty would prevail.

This is much more of an action adventure film than something like Roshomon, but Kurosawa still manages to throw in a lot of themes. The princess has a slight epiphony while walking among the peasants, and decides to save a girl before she becomes a sex slave; Tahei and Matakishi are both morally bankrupt but they still seem to serve a purpose in society; and General Rokurota and his rival both seem to say something about the merits and limits of honor. These themes are great and add some depth, but are subservient to sheer adventure of the film, which is how it should be.

This is a great swashbuckling film that is hands down better than any action film made in the last twenty years.  Some have come close, but I think most will agree that nothing beats The Hidden Fortress.  It is absolutely incredible that with all of the technical achievements over the years Kurosawa's action-adventure piece still holds up so well over the years.  Incredible.",1138406400,53,3554,4.605055292259084
525608,4,6302969697,"This is Kurosawa's fist use of widescreen, and it looks glorious.  While he managed to simulate wider shots in his past films with an academy aspect ratio, this, rife with innumerable extras and an epic landscape, is just awesome spectacle.  Like all good Kurosawa though, the story is simple, elemental, yet definitive.  The two peasants/thieves are an absolute riot, and Mifune comes across with amazing presence... as fantastically usual.

Criterion does the film justice with an excellent transfer, but with little in the way of supplementary material, especially when compared to recent releases --the introduction by George Lucas on this disk is great though.  For the price of this disk, the lack of audio commentary, etc... is unfortunate.

Truly a character driven story, the film boasts of people that are crass, yet lovable.  Not concerned with the apocalypse like Kurosawa is in some previous and later works, Hidden fortress offers a rousing adventure, which encapsulates classic story telling at its stylistic best.  As such, this is one of the favorites in my personal Kurosawa collection.",1137801600,26,1104,5.268571428571429

Two clownish, greedy men are enlisted by a warlord (Toshiro Mifune) and a princess to transport a pile of gold across the mountains to re-establish the princess's defeated clan. They get into all kinds of scrapes, many of them improbable and comic - a la the old Hollywood western action pictures - and, of course, succeed in their task. Also like many western heroes, the characters are inspired by a code of honor that places duty above all else. George Lucas stole freely from this movie when he was making STAR WARS, including the lengthy fight with lances. Mifune is excellent, as are the two buffoonish, bumbling fools (later reincarnated by Lucas as R2-D2 and C-3PO).

525610,3,6302969697,"The Hidden Fortress has some major problems with pacing and overlength. The first 15 minutes dealing with the aftermath of a war are great and the last hour is pretty good, but the hour of repetitive bickering and clumsy slapstick inbetween from the film's two unlovable clowns is incredibly grating. Yes, it's a bold move of Kurosawa to give centerstage to a couple of greedy, stupid, duplicitous and all but irredeemable scumbags, but unfortunately he neglected to make them particularly interesting greedy, stupid, duplicitous and all but irredeemable scumbags and there's only so much of them shouting, digging holes and performing pratfalls you can take. It might help if some of it was funny, but it's like watching a Bowery Boys movie from the days when they should have been drawing their pensions instead of still pretending to be teenagers.

Themes of honor and compassion are dealt with in passing as nominal hero Mifune fails to appreciate the preciousness of all life, not just that of the princess he is sworn to protect, but this is pure popcorn fodder with more than a touch of Vera Cruz about it (but none of it's economy of line), as evidenced by George Lucas lifting elements for his first Star Wars film. Oddly enough the influence on John Milius is far more noticeable than Lucas - the scene where Mifune chases two soldiers on horseback and cuts them down without leaving his saddle is clearly the inspiration for the fight on the beach in The Wind and the Lion (even the music is similarly orchestrated). It gets there in the end, but it takes its time about it.

The disc is light on extras - only a very half-hearted appreciation by George Lucas, who obviously doesn't think much of the film these days.",1136505600,4,1728,4.756666666666667
525611,5,6302969697,"the hidden fortress is often relagated to a place behind other more popular works of kurosawa like yojimbo, sanjuro, ran etc. but imo this movie is second only to seven samurai in terms of development of the plot and characters, acting, direction and sheer entertainment.

the plot is pretty simple - a defeated kingdom, a princess on the run, a loyal general, two greedy bumbling peasants who unaware of the true identity of the princess are used by the general to aid them in their escape.

the movie is in turns comic, adventurous and action packed.

kurosawa's greatness lies in bringing to the fore the pettiness of human greed and the greatness of idealism and loyalty. over the course of the movie the two peasants who are initially lured into the enterprise with the promise of gold, over a period of time as the plot develops are so enveloped by greed that they simply become human personification of greed itself! the transformation is done/shown so beautifully.

525612,2,6302969697,"The Hidden Fortress is classic Kurosawa, in every way--except for the wild overacting, inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film.  Had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued, or given comic material with more edge, skewering the upper classes as well as themselves, or been less in the focus and operated far in the background, this wouldn't have been a problem.  But instead we're offered a sort of Dumb & Dumber, Beavis & Butthead of Japan, 50 years ago.  (And yes, I know that is anachronistic, but it's all too true.)  ""Stupidity is funny"" wears thin after a short while, and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast.  Oh, here comes a rocky upwards incline: let's watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up, etc.

Which is all too bad, because while the rest of the film has its overblown heroics, its far from bad.  The interactions between cast members has both tension and grit, while the outdoor settings mark a difference from the usual run of Japanese period films (though Kurosawa addicts like myself will well recall what he could do in Roshomon).  Mifune is over the top but splendid, and the direction has energy and focus.

I've seen this film twice in 25 years; most recently, just last night, again.  Unfortunately, my initial impressions were only confirmed--and I wish they weren't.",1117843200,12,1455,4.807228915662651
525613,3,6302969697,"""The Hidden Fortress"" was disappointing in that it was probably about 30 minutes too long and dragged on unceasingly.

Familiar Kurosawa player the fabled and athletic Toshiro Mifune played the fierce General Rokurota Makabe whose Akizuki clan had just been defeated in battle.  Mifune's mission was the protection of the Princess Akizuki and her transportation along with the gold of the clan's treasury through enemy lines to a province allied with the Akizuki clan.

Mifune enlisted the assistance of two greedy peasant farmers through fear and his commanding presence. The peasants, bedraggled survivors of battle Tahei and Matashiki played by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara respectively were both excellent in their roles.  They played a duet reminiscent of cartoon chipmunks Chip and Dale constantly fighting with and berating each other.

Carrying the gold concealed in firewood the group escorted the princess from a hidden fortress though the mountains passing through legions of hostiles.  The princess was annoyingly portrayed by Misa Uehara whose manner of speaking or should I say screeching in staccato fashion was very difficult on the ears.

Their seemingly never ending trek had both its high and low points.  The movie however sagged whenever Mifune wasn't on the screen.  His action scene where he fought against a rival general with lances with disappointingly tame.  A scene that depicted a traditional fire dance was a notable high point of the film.",1117497600,4,1477,5.327586206896552
525623,4,6302969697,"I did not enjoy this movie as much as many other Kurosawa movies (Ran is my favorite, with the Seven Samurai a close number two) but this one contains many tidbits that still make it worth watching for any serious (or not so serious fan).

As has been said many times, this movie provided inspiration for Star Wars, and there are three ""Ahas""

1 - George Lucas appears in a bonus feature on the DVD talking about how the movie influenced him.

2 - The bickering of the two main characters (petty lowly peasants) brings up the groundbreaking idea of telling the story from the point of view of the lowest individauls, and not the heroes.  (Think R2D2 and C3P0 bickering)

3 - Mifune puts in a great performance as the samurai who would inspire Obi Wan.  Mifune is at his best under Kurosawa's tutelage, and this movie is no different.

Perhaps because I (obviously!) watched the movie with Star Wars blinders, I was guilty of looking more at the details than the story as a whole.  Certainly Kurosawa's movies have an attention to detail that encourages this.  At the end, though, I did not get much from the overall movie and felt it was good, but not the greatness of some of his other works.",1114300800,3,1193,4.486111111111111

Criterion got hold of a pristine negative and transferred it to disc splendidly. It's the best-looking black-and-white transfer I've ever seen. Not a speck or a scratch on it. Simply gorgeous.

Not much in the way of extras, though. No scholarly commentary, just a short interview with George Lucas about the film and its influence on Star Wars (an inferior film in every way; how ironic that Hidden Fortress is now mainly known as the inspiration for Lucas's overblown sci-fi epic). And the ""new, improved"" subtitles are actually rather silly and distracting: American teen slang intrudes occasionally, momentarily jolting the viewer out of the spell Kurosawa casts. These anachronistic turns of speech aren't found in the original Japanese dialogue, by the way.

Still, this movie has never looked better. Kudos to Criterion's transfer team, anyway.",1113696000,2,1098,5.372093023255814
525625,4,6302969697,"I'd heard rumblings about the films of the great director Akira Kurosawa for years before I finally got the chance to sit down and absorb some of his work. Famous directors, actors and critics sung his praises, credited him as an inspiration and labeled him as a legendary figure in film history. And, honestly, perhaps this is a film I'll grow to love after repeated viewings. Maybe I allowed all of Kurosawa's mystique to precede him, inflating my expectations to the point that they could never truly be met. Perhaps I'm overlooking the historical timeframe of the film, comparing it to 2005's feature-lengths rather than its 1958 contemporaries. All things considered, however, as my first exposure to the man's work, ""The Hidden Fortress"" was a bit of a let-down.

That's not to say I didn't enjoy the film, actually more to the contrary. This story of two greedy peasants, a stern, intelligent old warrior and a strong-willed young princess was generally very charming and entertaining. I found some of the translation to be a little awkward, especially in the way it integrated more modern phrases into what was obviously a period piece, (somehow I have trouble accepting the idea that anyone in feudal Japan would have casually spit out a phrase like ""this sucks"") but on the large the conversion from Japanese to English was done well and lacked some of the hiccups that are usually associated with an East-to-West translation. The plot is simple, yet not without intrigue; rumor has it that, years and years ago, a wealthy overlord hid his fortune of gold somewhere within his home. The tale is set near the end of a bitter war, and each character has a vested interest in recovering the secret stash and returning it to the safety of a non-warring territory. The first hour and a half moves fantastically, with the heightened tensions of the war, (and the uncertainty of every non-central character's loyalties) along with the constant inspections of occupying troops, really adding a touch of drama and tension to the journey. Had it not trudged onward for another hour, I'd have given it top marks. As is, it feels like the clean, simple main story was overrun with enough subplots and side stories to cover a whole trilogy. When it came to be time to wrap things up, the simple act of tying loose ends added another sixty minutes to the running time and just killed my excitement for both the story and the characters.

The disc is a little light on extras, including the original theatrical trailer (itself featuring a few clips of the film's production, nowhere to be found elsewhere on the disc) and an interview with George Lucas, along with the standard language and chapter selection tools. The Lucas interview, conducted especially for Criterion's DVD release of the film, barely gets rolling before it comes to an end and is largely disappointing. His acknowledgement that he borrowed a few ideas from ""Hidden Fortress"" in ""Star Wars"" isn't expanded into as much detail as I'd hoped, (considering it was that same remark on the ""Star Wars"" bonus disc that got me interested in this film in the first place) and he dances around the assumption that Princess Leia bears more than a few similarities to Princess Yukihime of ""Fortress.""

The video looks spectacular for a film that's nearly fifty years old, but that should almost go without saying when Criterion is concerned. It's particularly telling to watch the Trailer, which wasn't restored, immediately before or after viewing the film itself.

All in all, I was largely entertained and plan to further investigate Kurosawa's work, but felt the length of ""Fortress"" was almost crippling.",1109894400,3,3663,4.922330097087379

I had heard Lucas and a half dozen other film makers had used it as a reference (and in retrospect Kurosawa was undoubtedly influenced by serial adventures just as Lucas and Spielberg would be years later) but had not heard more. Man. Really good. Kurosawa creates this impossible journey full of courage, cowardice, faith, humor and above all excitement. Many dismiss it as bubblegum compared to his other efforts (including the titans Seven Samurai and Yojimbo). Well, I'll just keep on chewing then.

The main theme is double: the greed of the poor people in medieval Japan who were herded and crushed by the warlords like ants, and the rare opportunity of a princess to catch a glimpse of the real world of her vassals when she becomes a fugitive. Mifune plays the general Macabe who is a master of the martial arts and the main protector of the princess. The film follows the traditional Kurosawa lines but can not compare with the ""Seven Samurai"" and the ""Throne of Blood"".",1101772800,2,619,4.486725663716814

George Lucas claims that this helped inspire the original Star Wars movie. Don't look for an exact replica, though, the inspiration wasn't that direct. That just makes it more enjoyable, though, trying to figure out which moments in Hidden Fortress went into Star Wars, and how.

It's black and white - something I like, as a change, and I'm very glad it wasn't corrupted by colorization. The acting style is a bit posed and un-natural, by today's standards, but wasn't written to meet today's standards. Maybe the harshness in the princess' voice was meant to convey authority, but just sounded shrill to me. Well, the movie conveys the time in which it was made, not just the time it depicts, and I like that look back to recent movie-making history.

It's a good movie by itself, and important in the history of movies. Today's attention-deficient action junkies may find it slow at times, but that's hardly the fault of the movie. I like this one, and I'm sure I'll like it again when I see it again.

He loves to use contrasts: heat and a dry, gravelly landscape contrast with a spring of cool, fresh water. Two bumbling, hilariously-sketched peasants contrast with the dignity of the Princess and Mifune.

I cannot believe how amazingly beautiful and memorable some of the scenes are! Mifune, galloping on horseback after the officials, with his arms raised, and his sword perpendicular to the saddle...his body unmoving, not a budge...and the horse beneath him galloping, exploding in movement..racing full-tilt....the trees and bush in the background a blur, the horse's movements a blur, but Mifune is like a still shot in the midst of this speed...Kurasawa cuts and pans the scene. And, Mifune, solid, fierce, intent to kill ...that raised sword of vengeance. Wow. Blows me away.  I cannot even begin to describe it well enough.

Then, good old Chiaki, when he is so defeated by all the ill-fortune, sleeping on the ground, he wakes up and is crying to his buddy, ""Let's be friends forever."" I actually laugh out loud.

There are so many memorable scenes: When Mifune laughs as he enters the secret passage in the mountains surrounding the hidden fortress, he is such an heroic figure, he's almost frightening. When he tells of his sister's sacrifice..he is humble, and in pain, but careful not to show it. How can a guy communicate so much? I love Mifune dancing around the bonfire, and I love the cart scene, too. The young woman who becomes the princess' protector..isn't that also a wonderful transformation? Such good stuff! What about the relationship between the two opposing samurai: Mifune and his opponent? Isn't that awesome? It's really quite funny when Mifune, after murdering the two horsemen rides directly into the midst of the opposing army's camp! Like...hello! But, then, the verbal exchange between Mifune and his opponent is so surprising and cool. The spear fight is my least favorite fight of all Mifune's battles. But, I love the ending, where he jumps on his horse and smiles as he leaves.

The film is an absolute pleasure to watch, and worth viewing many times, for the landscapes, variety of scene settings, humor, compassion, and for thrill of it .",1100217600,2,2223,4.97843665768194

The Hidden Fortress is NOT an epic that gives great insight into the code of the samurai or other such nonsense. It's a fun romp through the misadventures of several bungling ""heroes"": Two greedy, cowardly peasants, a knight very similar to the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a bitchy, aloof Princess Yuki of Akizuki (a name that sounds like something from Dr. Seuss). They are trying to smuggle the Akizuki treasury (gold bars hidden in firewood) and the princess to safety. But greed, lust and stupidity keep getting in the way.
This movie is more of an old-style caper film than a samurai epic. The dumb, double-dealing characters are more from The Lavender Hill Mob than MacBeth. What makes the characters more interesting is that the two peasants don't hold a monopoly on greed and harebrained ""cunning plans"" that would make Baldric from The Black Adder proud, and the knight and the princess don't hold all the courage and nobility cards, either. In fact, the two peasants come up with a plan that literally saves their necks.
The way the film is told from the point of view of the two lowliest characters was quite novel and an obvious influence on George Lucas when he made the first Star Wars. The Hidden Fortress is a great movie in its own right, though. One shot in particular will stick in your mind. At the beginning you see a wounded samurai on foot getting cut down by horsemen. It is stark, shocking and weirdly beautiful.
To people with open minds without preconceived notions of what should and should not be in a Kurosawa film, The Hidden Fortress is a great movie.",1084665600,9,1851,4.6984615384615385
525643,5,6302969697,"Ok, so countless reviewers here love it, critics have praised it, and fans have enjoyed it.  Still haven't seen it?  Perhaps a layman's review will change your mind.  The first time I saw this I enjoyed it somewhat but didn't fully appreciate it until later viewings.  The film started rather slow for me, to the point where i was close to giving up on it.  But right about the time we meet up with the spunky and beautiful princess(who has an unfortunate habit of innocently bending over) and on to the start of their actual adventure away from the fortress, I was thoroughly captivated and actually cared for and about these characters(even the two greedy/wimpy ex-soldiers/farmers).  It was fun seeing them get into certain predicaments and wondering how they were going to get out of them(very clever and lucky how they got out of certain situations).  If you're looking for lots of samurai action you won't find it here, so i'll lower that expectation right now.  But if you want to root for a group of characters on their perilous yet fun adventure, it will be easy cause this film succeeds in delivering both.  It helps if you like these types of films but in no way is it a requirement to enjoy The Hidden Fortress.
Some standout aspects:
* some very memorable scenes like the massive prisoner escape scene, the scene where Mifune inadvertently rides into the enemy camp,  and the scene where a peasant girl is protecting the princess by holding a big rock for the longest time.
* great performances, especially by Mifune as the unflappable general
* a sense of ""how the heck are they gonna get out of that"" is present throughout the film that keeps you interested.

Although I walked out of the theatre feeling slightly disappointed, that a movie with such potential would have to be ruined by typical hollywoodism, and the poor choice of casting Tom Cruise, it left me with a curiousity about other Samurai themed movies. This is how I stumbled across Kurosawa.
Although lacking the blood, and special effects of newer releases, it lacks absolutely none of the intensity. In fact, I was on the edge of my seat during 'the duel.'

It's an entertaining, engrossing adventure, with Toshiro Mifune's stoic general butting heads against the peasants (and the princess) at every turn.  Fujiawara and Chiaki pretty much steal every scene they're in, with their bickering and squabbling and amazing amount of greediness shining through at every opportunity.  The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, there's ample doses of humour, a standout fight scene - what else could you ask for?

Protected by her closest general but trapped in enemy territory, a young princess is aided by two hapless farmers.  Their journey takes them across a dangerous 16th Century feudal Japan, as they transport both princess and her gold to safety.
Review
This was Kurosawa's last film for Toho studios, and his first using the widescreen techniques that he developed into a recognised style of his own in later films such as Ran and Yojimbo.  As part of the celebrative retrospective at the NFT in London, The Hidden Fortress has been given a new print and extended run, and should definitely not be missed.
Overshadowed by his more popular texts, Kurosawa takes the `chambara' genre to new heights; this is not merely teatime viewing, or a swashbuckling fantasy, but a beautifully executed examination of the human condition and its relationship to the environment it exists in.  We open with a wide shot of the two foolish farmers walking towards a distant horizon that is highlighted with rows of trees and high mountains.  They should be happy as they leave the battered war zone behind them for the lush hills ahead, but instead they argue over the petty nature of their relationship.  This is something they continue to do throughout the film - as they are later driven by the greed of transporting gold concealed within driftwood - not taking into account their effect upon each other, environment, or companions.
Indeed it is the metaphorical idea of these hidden riches within dead wood that is one of the major driving forces behind the text.  Though the story is essentially told from their point of view, they are never aware of their help in transporting the princess to safety, nor that the man who commands them is a famous general.
There is a strong sense of the effect of nature upon man, which can be as unnoticed as it can striking:  An argument between the two farmers uses the scope of widescreen to its full advantage, as they are distanced by a gully they had just dug in a futile attempt to discover gold.  But for me the fog closing in around the general as he is told of the death of his sister, and the subsequent track into his eyes as he controls his emotions in realising the tactical advantage is captivating.  Finally it should be noted that the effect of the incongruous princess, who holds her body as a man after being brought up as a son, takes the narrative journey as a personal discovery of the self; the perfectly edited montage whirl of the fire ceremony and a glimpse of her contact with others and freeing of hidden spirit is truly special: Life comes at a price:
""Kindle your life in the bonfire's flames,"" the dancers sing.  But be careful as, ""Moths singe their wings in the flame...""

The Verdict
This film is a pure classic, and if you have a stigma about black and white foreign films, I implore you to put that to one side.  Take a chance to see the director who has inspired everyone from Spielberg to Tarantino.  Speaking of which this is the film a certain Mr Lucas lifted the plot of to create Star Wars.  Though I must say after the recent effort of Episode One, he definitely took all the humour for Episode Four from The Hidden Fortress and has very little of his own!  This film is a golden text from one of the greatest auteurs of the 20th Century - enjoy!",1073433600,6,3319,4.58277027027027
525647,4,6302969697,Another solid film from the Japanese master Kurosawa.  Watch for the ceremony that happens near the end of the movie.  I didn't know they had ceremonies like that in Japan!,1072828800,,172,4.7
525648,5,6302969697,"Seriously, though, this classic movie by Akira Kurosawa was the film that inspired George Lucas's Star Wars, the classic first one, that is.
The story opens in the land of Akizuki with two bedraggled peasants, Tahei and Matakichi, who have clearly been through the wringer, what with there being an interclan war going on between Yamana and Akizuki.  Yamana has won, though they are mopping up survivors.  Both were apparently captured and made to dig graves and now want to return to their home in Hayakawa.  However, there are two problems.  One, they've sold everything they own and will go back to nothing.  Two, the Yamana have set up a tight border between Akizuki and neighbouring Hayakawa so they can't go back.  Also, when the two aren't bewailing and bemoaning their ill fate, they are hurling horrid insults and screaming at each other.
However, they decide to go through Yamana, which borders both lands, and sneak into their own land that way.  This plan so impresses Makabe Rokurota, the famed general of Akizuki, who impresses them into service to help him smuggle five thousand ryo (gold pieces) into Hayakawa, where the lord will give asylum to the Akizuki clan so they can restore themselves.  Oh, and the gold is shaped into flute-shaped rods that are smuggled inside pieces of wood.  Accompanying them is Princess Yuki, who has a price on her head.
The peasants' greedy, cowardly, and deceptive nature is revealed along the way.  Many times, when the odds are against them, they try to sneak away with the gold, only to decide to stay with Rokurota because he's tough enough to defend them and has the wits to keep them all alive.  But most of the time, their bumbling cowardice gives this film its comic relief.  Tahei, the larger of the two is played by Minoru Chiaki, who also came out in The Seven Samurai as Heihachi the woodcutting samurai, as did Kamatari Fujiawara (Matakichi) as Manzo, the father of Shino who cut his daughter$B!G(Bs hair to prevent samurai from lusting after her.  Speaking of Seven Samurai, Takashi Shimura, the lead samurai in that movie, has a brief role here as the elderly general in the hidden fortress.
Rokurota's character is the most admirable here.  He's strong, a good fighter, and a noble servant to his clan, but most of all, he's a good strategist, knowing how to stay ahead, and knowing when to make sacrifices.  His bluffing his way into town to make themselves less suspicious to the occupying Yamana soldiers is reworked in Star Wars when Ben Kenobi tells the stormtroopers, ""You don't need to see his identification.""  As he tells the peasants, you hide a stone among stones, and hence a man among men.  In other words, don't stand out, but blend in.  He gets angry at the peasants when their duplicity comes out, but nevertheless realizes he needs them to carry out his mission.  There's a good duel scene between him and a Yamana commander, Tadokoro Hyoei showing his fighting skills.  Toshiro Mifune was a perfect choice to play Rokurota.
The princess, though, is distressed and full of emotion and kindness, but in a reckless, immature manner.  To disguise herself, she has to be a mute, as her noble speaking would give her away.
The Fire Festival is a climactic scene, as the song done during that dance tells the way of the world and a moral: ""Set fire to men's lives with the bonfire flames.  Insects throw their lives into the bonfire flames.  Ponder and you'll see the world is darkness and this floating world is a dream.  So burn in mad abandon.""  In other words, we only have one life here, and it is up to the person to burn, i.e. to live, but according to the choice one makes.
Rokurota is the inspiration for Obi-Wan Kenobi, the two peasants' rough and disreputable characters were toned out to become Threepio and Artoo, Princess Yuki became Princess Leia, and the Yamana soldiers became stormtroopers.  No, there is no one from here who inspired Darth Vader, Chewbacca, or Luke Skywalker.
What makes this work is the way the characters keep running into perils, and escape by the skin of their teeth, only to run into something else.  Human values of loyalty, but also that of human nature is depicted very well here.  The actors are also top-notch, especially the three male leads.

Mifune, as General (Makabe) Rokurota, is elemental yet droll as always; this man is a force of nature. The fact that he does all of his own stunts in this film, especially the strength & control he exhibits in his horseback riding (Takedo-""no-hands"" school) style & his use of the spear in the ""duel"" w/ General Hoye (Fujita,Susumu) is remarkable, especially for an actor @ the age of 39.
The peasants, Tahei (Chiaki,Minoru) & Matashichi  (Fujiwara,Kamatari) act as perfect pitiful foils to Mifune & the rest of the cast. They are deliciously whiny & underhanded, but you've gotta love them.
Princess Uki (Uehara,Misa) is physically & emotionally stiking, possessing an undercurrent of sweetness which is disarming. She's a warrior princess with the heart of a lyrical hummingbird.

No, really, Misa Uehara had a great outfit that showed off her nice legs.
I love the interaction between characters, the action that never seems to stop and the poor farmers.  In the end they value friendship more than gold.",1066953600,4,571,4.68
525651,4,6302969697,"The hidden fortress starts with it's two main characters Tahei and Matakashi (played by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara) walking through a war torn country side. They have just escaped from an internment camp after a recent great battle. The two had been forced to dig graves as prisoners and they are already, at the start of the movie, at wit's end. They soon become frustrated with each other and their situation that they set out in opposite directions, only to be both recaptured shortly thereafter. After a prisoner mass uprising and subsequent exodus, the two find themselves completely unscathed but monumentally stunned amongst the dozens of dead.. and piles of pillaged gold.
Unable to carry much in their escape, their sense of scheming is palpable and a testament to the quality of direction. While walking through the woods they come upon a camping warlord, General Makabe (played by Kurosawa mainstay, Toshiro Mifune), who they enlist to help them steal the gold. Makabe has other ideas. They later meet up with the fiercely sexy Princess Yukihime (Misa Uehara) who playfully defends herself from the two anti-heroes, smacking all insolent fools with a reed and secretly running the show. The two rogues suffer through constant harassment with wide eyed fear and cowardice that Kurosawa somehow makes endearing.
It was said that Kurosawa would spend the mornings of the writing process thinking up impossible situations for the two rogue protagonists and the production crew would have the afternoon to plot out how the two would escape from certain death; The pair survive numerous captures, a prison riot, multiple rock slides (!) and more often than not each other during a sometimes cathartic, sometimes hilarious series of events. The Hidden Fortress is an archetypal dark comedy and could be well adapted in the future because of it's intelligent dynamics and carefree yet succinct episodes (the first Star Wars employs much of the same wide open sense of adventure).
While being one of the lightest of Kurosawa's films, it still has the underlying fatalism and rebelliousness that is inherent of much of interesting Japanese cinema. For examples, see much of mainstream (and probably most non mainstream) anime, as well as the nihilistic cult films of today like the recently Americanized Ringu (The Ring) and Kyua (Cure) by Kiyoshi Kurosawa (no relation). The Hidden Fortress is worth a viewing by any patient film buff.",1059609600,5,2446,5.132832080200501

I just want to establish the fact that I hate George Lucas' films and I don't believe Star Wars has any significance to anything.
This film is not one of Kurosawa's best. It lacks the powerful message, brick-in-the-balls kind of thing he had going on in previous movies, but this is nevertheless one of my favorite films. Don't watch this for Star Wars. Watch this because Kurosawa is said to be the greatest filmmaker to ever live. Know also that Mifune Toshiro is said to be the greatest actor of all time.
The movie itself was beautifully executed, extremely expensive for its time, and featured a cast over over 1,000,000. With a beautful script and wonderful camera work, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with intrigue. Watch this, but also watch the rest of Kurosawa Akira's films, especially my ersonal favorite, Red Beard (Akahige.)",1053734400,7,1065,4.731182795698925
525673,5,6302969697,"1950s Kurosawa film the one that Lucas said most influenced Star Wars is both daring and humorous. Mifune (Jedi-like), the frequent Kurosawa hero is tasked with smuggling a princess (Princess) out of enemy territory after losing a war.  The movie actually begins with two funny peasants (Droid-like) that Mifune will eventually pick up in his quest.  Although they are more interested in the gold that Mifune he is bringing along they prove helpful despite them selves.  There is a great scene in the second half of the movie where Mifune takes on three warrior guards, and it?s great because up until then Mifune seems tough, but you don?t know how tough.
One of the best parts of the transfer is that the subtitles reside in the black area below the widescreen film.  This should be a must among transfers to DVD, but I?m surprised how little it is done.  The special features are really scant for a Criterion Collection film.  There is a George Lucas interview where he says that Hidden Fortress was a big influence, but then he says that he probably likes 3 other Kurosawa films better.  It also offered the trailer and Color Bars to calibrate my machine.

Like ""Seven Samauri"", this is an epic adventure, with spectacular black-and-white photography, that throws everything but the kitchen sink in.  This one's tighter and better edited than ""Seven Samauri"" though - it doesn't drag, and keeps the viewer tightly engaged throughout its length (139 minutes).
If you like movies, you'll like this.  The film is often mentioned as a primary influence on ""Star Wars"".  Well, it is.  George Lucas as much as admits this in the short interview present on the DVD.  ""Star Wars"" fans probably become angry at film snobs pointing out the debt that film owes to this one, and at claims that this is the better movie.  Well, they're both great, fun movies.  And this one is undoubtably an influence on the other one.

525675,4,6302969697,"The making and premise of Hidden Fortress shows again Kurosawa's ability to display stories for a vast audience. Almost with comedy as his goal he starts the movie (much like Yojimbo but, without the biting parody and satire) from the perspective of two very off-beat characters (played to perfection by two famous actors in the Kurosawa acting guild). And too, much like another movie, Seven Samurai, Toshiro Mufine's character doesn't really come into the movie until later (also adding to the subtle comedy and interaction with the, as Lucas says in the dvd extra ""the R2-D2 and C3PO character sketch""). The cast is good but if you look too closely you might become annoyed with the young princess at first, but lucky for her it's played out well by Mufine and another actress in a smaller role (who protects her from the two main off-beat characters in a moment of perversion). All the characters in the movie are cast very well and each one seems to have his/her friend/enemy. For instance, the opposing general that takes on Mufine in a long (and somewhat funny) spear duel. Over all one can't help but to like this movie for what it is: a coming of age story mixed with an escaping from difficult odds mixed with the comedy of errors and finding allies in unexpected characters. However, after the veiwing of the really unneeded Lucas extra, you could easily pick out the obvious inspirations/stealing? of the film that ran over into the Star Wars films (probably to the chagrin of the die hard Star Wars nerd, yes, 'ol George just didn't make it up on his own, but much like John Woo does, he, for lack of a better word ""borrows"" from the ""true"" source, and then mixes into the fray all sorts of other ""borrowed"" material). There really is only one thing that didn't sit well with me in this dvd and that is probably the same reason 50% of consumers bought this movie: to see what they heard was the main inspiration to the great George Lucas archives. But, you wanna know something, I really don't care. [...] This is only one film among the greats out of the country of Japan (and many of us are still waiting for ""real material"" to be included on these special dvd's). Who of us wouldn't long for ""Dreams"" or a special release of Kurosawa's early films? Nevermind the countless rip-offs of the Japanese cinema, let's go back to the basics and do another great release like the awe-inspiring Criterion Seven Samuria or Rashomon.... After reading Donald Ritchie's book on Kurosawa you can see the influence of the Noh theater in Hidden Fortress. One of Kurosawa's early works was this movie called ""They Who Step On The Tiger's Tail"", and this movie (The Hidden Fortress) is a possible remake of the older period piece which is also famous in the Kabuki and Noh plays. Though here, in this dvd, Kurosawa had more freedom to do as he pleased as a director not inhibited by govermental or military censorship. The movie itself is a mixing (or clash) of modern and ancient ideals. Kurosawa's lighthearted drama is a great movie to watch in these respects. It's only too bad this (and a whole bunch of other fine material) wasn't included on the dvd format. Only if the obvious Lucas plug was taken out, then we could have had something of real interest to watch and learn. And perhaps this is too much to ask the mega-corporate Criterion, who have re-released so many movies. Perhaps a more fresh approach by another company not just interested in profit would give us in the appreciative audience something to rant about.",1033257600,2,3528,4.673633440514469
525676,5,6302969697,"This is very lighthearted fun compared to Kurosawa's other films. It is also very funny and the two mumbling peasants are great fun, they are clearly George Lucas' inspiration for R2D2 and C3PO. The great Toshiro Mifune is also great in his role, again his screen pressence is commanding and demans attention, you can also tell he was having fun. This is one of the best adventure films of all time, it is one cliffhanger after another. It's only flaw is that it is a bit overlong, and some characters are not fully realized, but this is barely noticeable, since the films' main objective is to entertain, and it succeeds handsomely at that. I would recommend this film for those beginning to get interested in Japanese cinema, since it's lighthearted and the story is easy to follow, also they will get hooked on Kurosawa, which in itself is a good thing.

They are a couple of low comics; the sort that in Shakespeare only high school English tearchers seem to think are funny.  These 2 are so low they seem to have permanently scrapped knees.  By turning them into androids George Lucas actually gave them personalities.  Amidst their misadventures they meet a samurai (Mifune) who is protecting the princess of the defeated army and is trying to get her back to her own country so she can literally raise a new army.  He tricks these 2 into helping them.  The princess' acting style is all DEPORTMENT IN ATTITUDE.  She seems to be auditioning for the lead in ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS.  Along the way they meet a religious dancing sect who dance something that looks like it wants to be a parody of the monkey dance in KING KONG but it doesn't quite come off.

Being Kurosawa, he could not help but slip in social commentary and wisdom.  There is depth here not found in the casual blockbuster.  Yet, it lacks the careful insight of his more focused work such as ""Ikiru"" and ""Seven Samurai.""  I love ""Hidden Fortress"" and consider it a good balance to heavier films.  I am not always in the mood to work for enlightenment.  Sometimes I just want to be entertained.
The Criterion Collection DVD is fantastic.  Criterion seems to be working to include more extras in there DVD releases, and the George Lucas interview is nice.  The picture, sound and translation are all impeccable.",1017878400,6,1097,4.972527472527473

The criterion transfer is one of the better I've seen...This is definately a keeper if you enjoy foreign movies, or any movies for that matter.

525681,5,6302969697,"An early Kurosawa film, dating from 1958. It is in parts a comedy which translates reasonably well across the cultural barrier. The plot of the film concerns a princess, whose kingdom has been defeated in battle. She must secretly take her gold into a neighboring kingdom so that she can hire an army to defeat her enemies.
The film is told through the eyes of two vagabonds who find some of the gold and spend most of the film trying to steal it. Toshiro Mifune is at his charasmatic best playing the princesses bodyguard and general.
The structure of the film is basically a road film as the two vagabonds, the princess and the general make their way past hazard after hazard to escape into the neighbouring kingdom. They form a sort of loose alliance, with the vagabonds ever hopeful of stealing the gold. Mifune on the other hand is steadfast and able to overcome all obstacles. Like all of his period films, Kurosawa is able to realistically create the feel of medival Japan. The opening scene is one of the more impressive of Japanese films.
The later films by this director such as Ran and Kagamusha seemed a little sterile. This is very much a film made at the peak of his career and has been noted by others was one of the inspiratins for Star Wars.",1011139200,,1258,4.521929824561403

525713,4,6302969697,"If you're a major Star Wars fan, you've undoubtedly attached this title to the Star Wars mythos, reasonably so. George Lucas claims that this is the movie that inspired Star Wars, most noteably the characters of RD-D2 and C3PO, and a certain feisty princess. In a short interview that accompanies this DVD, Lucas explains the origins and connections and his own experiences as a Kurosawa fan. Lucas is quick to note however that this is not his favorite Kurosawa flick.
Of all the Kurosawa flicks I own, this is probably my least favorite. Now, my least favorite Kurosawa flick equates to one of the best movies I've seen this year, but it's definitely not his best when compared to movies like ""The Seven Samurai"", ""Yojimbo"", ""Rashomon"" and ""Ran"" (I'm particular to the samurai flicks as you can tell). Toshiro Mifune does a masterful job as always, and the movie is well deserved of it's status as a classic, but it lacks a lot of the power of the aforementioned movies.
What it does have in common with those films is the strong visual element that Kurosawa is known for. Kurosawa was well ahead of his time, able to look at a film as a moving tapestry or painting as well as a story. He took great strides to ensure that every element of a film worked to improve the whole whether it be photography, music or plot. It's that incredible attention to detail, a true artists eye, that elevates this film above the story being told (it's not a bad story, just not ""great"").
If you're just getting started on your collection, do yourself a favor and start with the other movies I've mentioned first. This is a great flcik, but this is not Kurosawa's best. If you're only interest in this movie is it's connection to Star Wars, don't stop there, give Kurosawa and yourself a chance and check out his other movies (especially Seven Samurai).

This movie has a very good story line, great acting by Mifune, and of course great directing.

The story, I find, starts slowly as it focuses on the peasants, establishing their characters. It takes a while before getting to the heart of the movie.

I understand that Star Wars is an unparallel film for it's time and beyond, but between Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress, at least one quarter of his trilogy scripts was developed by Kurosawa.  Main similarities are the two peasants (c3po - r2d2), a princess (Leia), a samurai general who gets no respect from the princess until he had proved himself (Han),  the samurai's best friend (Lando)...How does Lucas sleep at night knowing this film is his masterpiece?  He should have called the Jawas - Sawas.  This only leads me to believe somewhere out there is another director's piece of work he'll say is not his favorite, but helped him write one half of American Graffiti or Raiders.

The Hidden Fortress is all Kurosawa and you are better off anticipating something like Yojimbo or 7 Samurai.  The main similarity to Star Wars is that the tale is told from the two most insignifigant characters.  The film follows two useless pesants around (much like Star wars follows around R2-D2 and C-3P0) while the action happens surrounding them.  There are other similarities, but this is the most striking.  As always in Kurosawa movies, there are shots that are angled a certain way to provoke a certain effect that you will probably recognize as having seen a thousand times in modern movies, but the thing that is remarkable here is that chances are this is the first time they were used.  Mifune gives a typically great performance so this movie is definately worth checking out, just don't take the Star Wars comparisons too seriously.

525732,4,6302969697,"I'd heard about THE HIDDEN FORTRESS as a young man whenever the roots of STAR WARS were discussed.  FORTRESS is always mentioned as the film that influenced George Lucas the most in crafting his STAR WARS films.  It wasn't until last year that I actually decided to rent it and see what it and its director Akira Kurosawa were all about. THE HIDDEN FORTRESS was my first introduction to the incredible direction of Akira Kurosawa. I've gone on to watch several of his other films and am now a huge fan. I also discovered that quite a few Hollywood movies have their roots in Kurosawa films.  Interestingly enough, an interview with George Lucas has been included on the disk as a bonus, which completes the HIDDEN FORTRESS/STAR WARS connection.
FORTRESS is a fast-moving film.  It's story is reminiscent of the serials of the 1930's (including ""wipes"" to transition from scene to scene -- again, another technique that Lucas borrowed for STAR WARS).  Our heroes leap out of frying pan into fire on several occasions.
The Japanese style of acting (at least in 1958 when this film was made) is very stylized and  little over the top or ""stagey"".  However, the stylized performances only add to the wonderful, other-worldly atmosphere of HIDDEN FORTRESS.  That's one thing that I enjoyed about this Kurosawa film:  it definitely takes the viewer to a world he has not seen before ... a weird, ancient and savage old-Japan.

This film is a rousing action adventure with few pretensions to great art, while Seven Samurai, although containing breathtaking battle scenes, is a more profound work. I'd recommend this film first, especially as it seeem to have had a larger budget with many spectacular sequences.
The film itself is marvellously entertaining, with classic characterisations from the entire cast, especially the two bickering peasants who accompany the General (Toshiro Mifune, brilliant as always) and the young princess into enemy territory.
Criterion's anamorphic DVD transfer is quite simply flawless, much finer than 'Seven Samurai', decent though that is.  No nicks or scars at all, and the subtletly of varying grays is marvellous.  In fact I can't think of *any* black and white film I've seen which looks better on DVD, and I've seen quite a few, like the great 1959 courtroom drama 'Anatomy Of A Murder' (James Stewart), which looks excellent (I recommend it).
Woody Allen's 'Manhattan' and Scorsese's 'Raging Bull' (which date from 1979 and 1980) don't look any finer.  This 1958 transfer is that good!
The sound is decent mono (there is also an unusual 3 channel fake stereo version if you want to try it, it sounds good), and decent extras, including an interview with George Lucas, who was of course influenced by this film when he made Star Wars.
Do not miss this excellent film on this outstanding DVD.  Then sample the Kurosawa/Mifune symbiosis in 'High & Low', and 'Seven Samurai' (perhaps in that order).  The former's Criterion transfer is excellent, the latter less so, but still good.",992217600,8,1721,5.085106382978723
525737,5,6302969697,"This terrific 1958 action adventure is probably best known as the inspiration for George Lucas' ""Star Wars."" Exotic adventure, historical myths, moral themes and knight-like chivalry are the prime elements in Akira Kurosawa's 1958 magnum opus of heroic action and self-discovery.
The plot concerns a general and a princess who must escape enemy forces while smuggling royal treasure out of hostile territory with two inept, conspiring peasants at their sides.  Kurosawa's uses all the cinematic tools to deliver  a spectacular blend of epic action, wry humor and human compassion.  Man in nature, man against nature, man against man and man fulfilling his destiny or fighting fate are all played out in rain and fog, on rock and sand, in woods and water.
The superb visual composition and lighting make this among the very best of all black and white films.  Rich greys, velvety blacks and silvery glints of dazzling light abound in the deeply evocative cinematography in this stunning, newly restored, widescreen (2.35:1) Tohoscope transfer.  The disc includes an exclusive new interview with George Lucas.  A must have.  139 minutes, not rated.  ...",991785600,4,1151,5.251366120218579
525738,4,6302969697,"Thanks to Criterion, here is another title that will find its place in your library : Akira Kurosawa's HIDDEN FORTRESS. Shot in Tohoscope and in b&w, this 1958 action film may easily be compared to any Hollywood movies of the late fifties. In fact, HIDDEN FORTRESS is superior to most of the american productions of that period for a simple reason : Akira Kurosawa had a personal style very recognizable while Hollywood directors were very often only yes-men hired by producers for their technical skills.
The first 5 minutes of HIDDEN FORTRESS are already a moment of anthology. As well as the duel scene involving a fabulous Toshiro Mifune. The cinematography is gorgeous, Akira Kurosawa filming a wide variety of landscapes under the sun, the rain, in the fog, by day and by night : simply stunning. If you are not familiar with japanese movies, HIDDEN FORTRESS or YOJIMBO, also available in the Criterion Collection, could be an excellent introduction to this cinema that has produced numerous masterpieces.
As bonus features, a trailer and a 10 minutes interview with George Lucas recorded in january 2001. The american producer confirms that HIDDEN FORTRESS had a great influence on him while he was writing the Luke Skywalker saga. Movie lovers had already noticed it a long time ago.

525739,5,6302969697,"The least of Kurosawa's works is also the most fun. It follows the adventures of two cowardly, greedy peasents as they try to smuggle 200 pieces of gold out of enemy territory. They encounter a powerful warrior, played by the great Toshiro Mifune, and a beautiful yet strong willed princess, to whom the gold really belong. Mifune is excellent as he outwits and outfights the enemy soldiers as well as bamboozling the hapless peasents by playing upon their excessive greediness. Parallels can be seen to Star Wars but not as many as you might think. Kurosawa's love of all things film can be seen in the impressive shots of the land as well as his cleaver editing techniques.",991440000,,675,4.728813559322034
525740,5,6302969697,"I have to confess my bias at the start:  Akira Kurosawa is easily one of my two or three favorite directors.  If forced to sit down and do a list of my 25 favorite films, SEVEN SAMURAI would be in a tie for first, and two or three others would join it on the list.
This was the first movie that Kurosawa made that was widescreen, and therefore the first that will derive maximum benefit from DVD.  (Read through the early reviews of the DVD of SEVEN SAMURAI to see some of the confusion over this.)  His use of the wider angle is magnificent, presenting the view with extraordinary vistas again and again.  Kurosawa never seemed to struggle with the technical aspects of filmmaking, and would later make a similarly effortless transition to color.
This is one of Kurosawa's finest films.  It is difficult to say that it is his best, since his very best films are among the greatest ever made.  Suffice it to say, that the film bears in every way the mark of greatness.  The camera work is flawless.  Though black and white, the film is gorgeous to look at every moment.  The acting is impeccable, with Mifune giving a somewhat difference performance in this one.  If we are more accustomed to think of him as a more fiery character, as in RASHOMON or SEVEN SAMURAI or THRONE OF BLOOD, in this one he is magisterial and aristocratic.
I think the parallels to STAR WARS are rather overblown, and anyone coming to this film looking for tones of George Lucas rather than Akira Kurosawa just may find themselves disappointed.  Yes, there is a princess, and yes, there are some very small plot parallels, and yes, there are two comic characters included to provide light entertainment and to move the plot along.  But none of these are crucial elements of THE HIDDEN FORTRESS.
But I do think the STAR WARS references bring up a very interesting point about Kurosawa:  more than anyother foreign filmmaker in history, Kurosawa is the one with the easist relationship with American culture.  People who normally dislike foregin film can respond powerfully to his films.  I once showed SEVEN SAMURAI to a group of high school boys.  These kids were almost in a state of mutiny, because 1) the film was black and white and 2) it was subtitled.  But by the end of the evening they were all entranced and had become fans of the film.
I think the reason they responded so easily was partly because Kurosawa was a cinematic genius, but also because he had absorbed so much of American culture and film technique in his films.  Just as many American films have borrowed directly from his work, so he borrowed from American sources.  Many of his films bear evidence of extensive exposure to film noir and American Westerns, and several of his plots are borrowed from American and Western sources.  One example:  much has been made of the fact that A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS was based on Kurosawa's YOJIMBO, but it is not as often noted that YOJIMBO was based on Dashiell Hammett's RED HARVEST, in which the Continental Op goes to the town of Personville (or, as a Brooklyn-accented  character in the book pronounces it, Poisonville) and turns two warring criminal factions against each other.
But if you haven't seen this film, do so.  Without any question one of Kurosawa's very finest films.",990230400,135,3272,4.660278745644599

Toshiro Mifune is the inspiration for Han Solo, but will never be matched or topped. As you watch each character introduced you will see such familiaraity that you will be flabbergasted how incredible this film truly is. This is the real deal, get rid of all of your copies of the Last Jedi, The Force Awakens and whatever else you worship as high adventure. Disney dropped the ball in a big way, betraying what made the characters so endearing in the first place. Kurosawa never felt to repeat himself, but make a movie and move on to the next. Its too bad we don't have anybody close to the genius that was Kurosawa. We would not have The Man With No Name films that made Clint Eastwood an international star! Akira has influenced more storytellers in film that cannot be listed here, not enough time or space for that here. There are not enough stars to rate here, this is cinema at its finest and i encourage all to join in and appreciate the true beauty on how amazing this film truly is.
As for the rest who know how much of a master storyteller Kurosawa was, i don't need to add anything for you only to upgrade to bluray to appreciate this film all over again.",1522886400,,1350,4.339920948616601
