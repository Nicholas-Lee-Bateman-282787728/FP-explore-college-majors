8354155,5,B00277552W,"I have learned more from his painting DVDs than from all my others. David Dunlop is a great teacher and painter. He is also very entertaining to watch and listen to. Most painting instruction videos are educational, but dry.
All his DVD's are educational, full of new techniques, and also fun. He demonstrates some techniques that I haven't seen on other painters videos.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Painting-Landscapes-With-David-Dunlop-Program-1-Oil/dp/B00277552W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Painting Landscapes With David Dunlop: Program 1- Oil</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Landscapes-Through-Time-With-David-Dunlop-Program-3-Cezanne-s-Mont-Saint-Victoire/dp/B00277QFEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Landscapes Through Time With David Dunlop: Program 3- Cezanne's Mont Saint-Victoire</a>",1258416000,3,871,9.13953488372093

Painting Landscapes with David Dunlop - Program 1 - Oil
Running Time: 2 hours
David Dunlop is a nationally well-regarded painter and an excellent teacher. He's engaging and funny and without doubt, he's dynamic in the classroom.  His newly released video, which takes place both in his Connecticut studio and in the field, brings the classroom to your living room as Dunlop discusses and demonstrates his techniques for finding, designing and painting landscapes in oil. Unlike other oil painting videos, Dunlop incorporates lessons from the masters and a thorough discussion of composition. Cool features: A relaxed, classical soundtrack as well as a ""painting morphing"" showing the progression of the painting from start to finish.

Art students and teachers as well as amateur and professional artists will enjoy these clearly explained and perfectly paced videos by Dunlop, a classically trained artist with a Master of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in New York City. He discusses basic supplies (various styles of brushes, types and colors of paint), the mechanics of selecting colors, and the variety of brush strokes that can be used to produce unique, inspiring paintings. Each of these videos has a section devoted to painting plein-air or out in the field. Watercolor includes a short history of watercolor painting, covering classical and modern styles. Classical music serves as a pleasant and inspirational background. Dunlop includes highlights of art history in his narration as well as motivation for the student painter. Each video concludes with stills of Dunlop's method to illustrate the evolution of the process. Judiciously edited and technically well photographed, these videos will help artists learn and improve their techniques; recommended for public, academic, and secondary school libraries. -Susan C.
