6414356,1,B00KC8V8NI,The TV Series was great but the series package was a ripoff by Amazon. Some DVD's would lock up couldn't watch entire disc.

6414364,5,B00KC8V8NI,"I've  liked  this  show  for  a  very  long  time.
I  own  every  season  on  DVD  except  for  the  8th  season.
Anything  that  can  go  wrong  in  Sparta  will  go  wrong.
Bill Gillespie  Bubba,  Parker, Virgil Tibbs,  Lonnie  &  Althea  all  take  what  they  do  very  seriously.  They  stop  crime  going  on  in  Sparta  from  every  angle,  kidnappings  rapists,  murders,  thieves.
I  didn't  like  it  too  much  when  they  moved  Gillespie's  position  from  being  Chief  of  police  to  being  the  Sheriff.
The  episodes  I  liked was  when  Bubba  goes  to  Los Angeles.  (Hearts  of  gold)  (Season 4)
Love  that  music  of  theirs  (Shooby  dooby  da  da  do)  in  this  show.
Its  what  makes  the  show  as  famous  &  as  good  as  it  is.
Love  this  show  &  can't  get  enough  of  it!",1501977600,,809,4.297709923664122

6414368,2,B00KC8V8NI,"I should have viewed the reviews before purchasing, but didn't. My comments are a repeat of all those customers who had bad discs. I am in the middle of season three and have had four programs that have frozen, and when I try to advance it, it either jumps to the end or skips over who knows how many minutes of the program. I'm surprised that Amazon doesn't correct this problem. Also, it would be helpful to have a series with sub-titles for the hard of hearing.",1492560000,,464,4.344827586206897

6414374,2,B00KC8V8NI,"I am very disappointed!! In Season 2, the third episode on disc 3 and disc 4 STOPS toward the end of the show. WILL NOT LET US SEE THE END!! We tried this in another player and it still freezes. Also, the end of Season 2 ends with a ""To Be Continued"". Season 3 does NOT take up where 2 left off. Season 3 has 10 episodes missing. I know because I Googled the full list of episodes. We would really like to watch these, but it is so frustrating with all these issues. What can be done?  Thank you, Brynea Day",1487030400,3,507,3.9705882352941178
6414375,1,B00KC8V8NI,"Season 2 the last disc freezes at the end of two episodes.  Also the last episode of season 2 ""MISSING"" is a two part but, you only get the first part.  Nowhere is is the 2nd part to be found.  Season 3 begins with an entirely different story.  Interesting enough is that season 2 ""The best of"" and the entire season 2 DVDs are not available.  What happened to the 2nd half?

This is a follow up to my previous review:  I have continued trying to watch the remain seasons and have seen several episodes freeze about 2/3rds of the way thru.  Additionally I have seen more episodes that are ""to be continued"", aren't!  The 2nd part is not to be found.  Have not yet finished watching the remainders of seasons, but based on what I've seen so far there will be more freezes and more missing
episodes.

Last follow-up to this order.  Absolute junk.  Too many missing 2nd parts, far too many episodes freeze.  Tossed into the trash!!!!!!",1487030400,10,932,4.437869822485207

6414389,3,B00KC8V8NI,"I wish I had read the reviews. Love the series but didn't realize that these were not the complete series. For example at the end of one of the seasons they leave you with a cliff hanger and the next season starts out like it never even happened, still don't know how it was resolved. You get so interested in the episode and then toward the end it just freezes, there is nothing you can do about it. It's extremely frustrating.",1476230400,6,428,4.296296296296297

6414395,1,B00KC8V8NI,"Terrible video quality.  Looks like badly stored video tape from the late 1950's or early 1960's.  I cannot imagine a less satisfactory product.

Is it possible that someone will clean up this mess and make a decent set?  I doubt it.  Other series of this era have DVD sets which are crisp and bright and don't have halts and stalls the way this edition does.

The DVD's should be reviewed before they are mailed and an annotation made of missing episodes. It's hard to rate what was an outstanding program that has been poorly reproduced and lacks quality control.",1445644800,3,472,4.839506172839506

I bought the series for my husband to watch when he gets home from being on the road several months at a time.  I'm very much disapointed in this as I don't watch them till my husband comes home so we can catch up together. How can we depend on the quality of the recordings and if we can have someone get intouch with us about the replacement or refund of the product.  My husband really likes the series and most of the other movies did finish but we would like to speak to someone ASAP or by email.  Thank you.,1427846400,5,680,4.128787878787879

It takes you back to a time when racial tension between the races were rough in the South.  I never visited Mississippii before, but  after watching these movies, I know it just a movie,  made me think of the State a little different.  With Bill Gillespie dating an African American lady and finally the positive relationship between Virgil and white police officers made watching a classic of its time.  It tells a story of how blacks, whites, and the community are supposed to be and that's no one is above the law we all work together.  I can watch In the Heat of Night over and over again.

Season 3, the last disc, half way through the second to last episode I experienced a blue screen . . . it just disappeared.  The final episode was gone as well. Nothing was on the disc for those two episodes.  Also, you advertised that it was the ENTIRE series.  Each season's disc case also calls it ""the complete season 1, 2, 3, etc.""  That was incorrect.

8657515,4,B00KC8V8NI,"The reviews are correct. The DVD's do have problems.
You will greatly enjoy watching ""The Heat of the Night"" programs. There are a number of episodes that are not on the disk. The reason stated is they didn't receive permission / release or something from the actors. I went through a print out of all the episodes and compared to what you receive. So you need to understand two things up front.
1) A few of the episodes will have disk errors.
2) NOT ALL EPISODES ARE ON THE DISK.
I thought perhaps that I needed to update the software on the BlueRay player, which I did, but to no effect. I did not try on an NON-BlueRay player (I gave those all away). When an error occurs you cannot move forward, but there is a WORK-AROUND. Use the scene selection and forward up to where the error occurs and then go past it. You can start again at that point and lose just a little of the movie (it always seems to be close to the end anyhow). You might have to go forward and back a couple of times to get it right.

It's a shame they do not fix the disk, just be prepared to experience what everyone talks about in the reviews.",1528675200,,1118,4.175925925925926
