5391690,5,B00A703Z1O,This was absolutely a good movie. I was kind of thrown off by the title but I am  so glad I watched it. I was so sad in the end that neither one got the girl. I would watch this movie again and will recommend it to everyone. Beautiful but sad story.,1382745600,2,249,3.7884615384615383
5391691,4,B00A703Z1O,very good show.  It will leave you feeling good and smiling.  I loved the show and recommend it to anyone,1380153600,,105,4.2
5391692,2,B00A703Z1O,"I thought about dumping this film out at about 30 minutes into its tortuous viewing (viewing---like at a wake),  but decided to give it a chance.

At 50 minutes I killed the sound and put on rock music so I'd have something to do while watching this thing. At 51 minutes I said, ""#$%^  it,"" and just quit.

This story was really really weak, and carried out sooooo slowwwwwly that it became excrutiating. Further, the dissability incurred by one of the players was plain totally unecessary to the ""plot,"" and just maaaaade it gooooo evennnnn ssssssslowwwerrrrr. Something different would have worked better.

Finally, just as a technical point here, which any director should know, you cannot silence a revolver, folks, especially with a one-inch long ""silencer."" And a suppressed firearm doesn't go ""phwupp!' It goes BANG! but not as loud. And the ""surveillance"" performed as part of the Interpol action was just silly in concept, the way the character explains it.

I just couldn't watch this film. I try not to say anything harsh but this film has no redeeming qualities whatever. The heroine is boring, the killer is happy and relaxed as loon, and the good guy is a lying manipulative weak creep---as portrayed. Ok, I get it, they're supposed to be ""original"" and ""different"" that way. They are just nonsensical.

I give this movie my semi-official, ""Eeeeeeeyewwww....""

...and I LOVE Korean films, as you might see from my other 100 reviews....",1375056000,,1449,4.934156378600823
5391693,3,B00A703Z1O,"Quality of the movie was pixelated.  Sometimes, it stutters too.  Otherwise, the premise of the movie and the acting is ok.",1368748800,,123,4.809523809523809
5391694,5,B00A703Z1O,"I loved the acting in this movie, even though I didn't like the ending. I don't like sad endings in movies, but they do happen in real life and so it has to be acted so, I guess. I recommend this movie as a good one.",1368489600,,216,3.717391304347826
5391695,4,B00A703Z1O,"This was a lovely film that made me happy, sad, and angry. Love can be a curse but it was the innocence of Daisy that will make you fall in love with its beauty.",1367020800,,161,3.764705882352941
5391696,5,B00A703Z1O,"Daisy is a love story with many twists and turns, but one could get lost in the subject matter? If you truely enjoy a story told by the Koreans like I do Daisy is the movie for you. The element of surprise comes at the end, but it was worth waiting for!",1366156800,,253,3.8846153846153846
5391697,4,B00A703Z1O,"I just got on the Korean bandwagon of late and I am loving it! Call me biased and pardon the pun but Jung Woo Sung totally kills it. I ""discovered"" him in ""A Moment to Remember"" and I can't get enough of watching his films. I wished they had ""A Season of Good Rain"" on Amazon as well. In truth, the location of this movie is picturesque and well shot. I loved the story and each actor played their parts well. We watch movies with a suspension of disbelief and ""Daisy"" succeeds in doing just that. It's poignant, emotional and thoroughly engaging. I turned it on whilst multitasking but the story soon drew me in and I left what I was doing to focus on the movie. If you are a newbie to Korean movies, you won't be disappointed. Watch it!",1365465600,2,738,4.24113475177305
5391698,4,B00A703Z1O,"I bought this movie because I love Jung Woo Sung acting. The first Korean movie I saw was Jung Woo Sung  ""The good, the bad, and the weird"" now I'm hooked on Korean movie. He is a great Korean actor and this movie proves it. It's a sad love story and I hate the ending, but the story line is good and the acting is excellent. I recommend this movie to everybody, even if you never seen a Korean movie before you will be hooked on Korean movie like me. I rated 4 stars only because of the sad ending, I like my movie to always have a happy ending.",1357948800,6,546,3.963636363636364

5391709,5,B00A703Z1O,why great movies usually have a sad ending? why? why?,1438992000,,53,4.4
5391710,1,B00A703Z1O,"Supposedly a love triangle between a young Korean girl painter (her paintings stink), a hit man, and some sort of investigator, beautiful images of Amsterdam and a pretty girl are all this film has to offer. I lasted fifteen minutes. I suspect it's a very lame spin on  ""Un Flic""  (Delon, Deneuve, Richard Crenna) about a gangster and a cop who share the same woman).

Amsterdam is beautiful, but otherwise order ""Un Flic"" and you'll be much more rewarded.",1438214400,,456,4.746835443037975
5391711,5,B00A703Z1O,"First Rate Story, acting and filming.  This was a Korean movie that stands out as a world class product.  Watched it twice over a six month period.",1436832000,,147,4.407407407407407

5391715,5,B00A703Z1O,"South Korean sad love/romance story that leaves the romance scenes to the audience's imagination like American movies use to be.  Great acting.  I was surprised by the ending, that's all I'll say because I don't want to ruin it for others.",1424995200,,239,4.804878048780488

5391720,4,B00A703Z1O,Really well done romance with some great twists. Quality of video is not the greatest.,1409011200,,86,4.8
5391721,5,B00A703Z1O,"I loved this film. I'm a hopeless romantic and this was both tragic and, for me, beautiful. That's one of the things I love about Korean films: they aren't all Frank Capra-esque pie in the sky plots. The title was nondescript and I almost passed it by. I'm really glad I didn't and I hope I can find a DVD of this film to purchase. I'd enjoy occasionally watching it over again.",1408492800,2,378,4.263888888888889
5391722,4,B00A703Z1O,"This is a totally different plot from the last few I reviewed. That is the best part of Korean dramas being offered on amazon. I had no idea how this plot was going to unfold. Would either win the heart of the beautiful young artist? No, I will not tell. Watch it and see. I enjoyed the plot and the story.",1401753600,,306,4.032786885245901

5391724,5,B00A703Z1O,"This was a surprise to me. The acting was flawless and the story fantastic!!
Yes, it was sad, but also beautiful.  This film is one of my favorites. The director

5391725,5,B00A703Z1O,"If you are expecting an action packed Korean movie, you'll be disappointed.  Even though this story is about a cop, an assassin, and a girl.  There will be far and few actions in this movie.  It's not an action movie.  What it is, is a slow pace love story about a young female artist who thought she found love only to lose it so quickly and rediscovering it again but will it be a little too late the second time around?

After finding love with an undercover police officer, Hye-young, quickly loses him after she was injured in a shoot out.  Feeling sad and depress; a stranger with a secret comes into Hye-young's life to help her through her difficult time.  Along the way she learns to accept this new friend in her life.  Will Hye-young find love again?  will she ever see her ex again?  will the new man in her life complicate things when his secret catches up to them.",1385510400,3,878,4.364197530864198
8547562,5,B00A703Z1O,"I love this movie, it isn't the extended version. It is about an assassin who falls in love with a young artist and starts to watch her from a far and sending her flowers. Never showing his face to her but the artist knows she is watched by someone who cares for her. She then meets another man whom she believes to be her Watcher.",1482796800,,331,4.107692307692307

8547569,1,B00A703Z1O,"If you are a big fan of Korean cinema, this movie is not for you. I was sort of tricked into watching it because of the Korean cast with actors I really like. About half way through, I paused it and looked it up because it felt so off. There is a reason for this. It was directed by Andrew Lau of Infernal Affairs fame. Great Hong Kong action director. Unfortunately, here he tried to make a slow and complex Korean drama and failed miserably. This was a straight forward, two dimensional story with forced melodrama and kindergarten symbology. Now, don't get me wrong, Korean films can be very melodramatic, but this was done in such a blunt and ham-handed way that it came off as trite. The action sequences were so oddly edited that they seemed to belong to an entirely different movie. Also, this movie looks dated--like it was from 1996, not 2006. Highly disappointing if you are familiar with modern Korean movies at all.",1462233600,2,927,4.5568862275449105
8547570,1,B00A703Z1O,"I am a big fan of Korean tear jerker movies but this is absolutely awful. The lead female is one of my favorite actress (also in My Sassy Girl and Windstruck) Most of the scenes are just someone staring into space, staring at each other, the action scene is laughable. Not sure how I managed to watch the entire movie but it was a very painful two hours.",1461628800,,354,4.220588235294118
