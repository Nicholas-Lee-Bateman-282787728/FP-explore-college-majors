8685660,3,B00OZ0AOFC,"I have been absolutely obsessed with this show for years, so when I saw there was a Farewell on Paley Fest I was ecstatic! I had already watched the Paley Fest with the cast in the earlier years of the show and LOVED it. However, this Farewell version wasn't nearly as fulfilling as I was hoping. For starters, Jason Segal (Marshall Erikson) is absent! It really upset me that NO ONE seemed to mention that before I made the purchase. Neil Patrick Harris (Barney) is absent as well but he does try to Skype the cast and says a few words but the connection is TERRIBLE so there tends to be awkward delays. Overall, as much as I LOVE How I Met Your Mother, I feel like I could've passed on watching this considering it's not included in Amazon Prime. The first one is far more entertaining and it's included in Prime! If you're a fan of HIMYM and haven't had a chance to watch it yet, go check it out!",1453766400,,899,4.2631578947368425
8685661,5,B00OZ0AOFC,"This is a nice show starring a bunch of nice people who made a really nice sitcom about some really nice people living their really nice lives in a ""nice"" city.  And now that it's all over, I sort of resent them for nicely sucking me into the whole nice thing and making them a nice part of my nice life.",1418428800,2,304,3.9836065573770494
