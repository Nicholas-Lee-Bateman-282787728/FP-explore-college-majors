8133754,4,B000GPPPHM,"This a Fantastic Lecture on Matisse by Rosamond Bernier who knew Matisse personally. I really enjoyed hearing her anecdotes and seeing the slide presentation, which shows a lot of lesser known works. This is a DVD for real Matisse aficionados. It is also a touching social documentation of a beautiful cultured woman in her prime, talking about a topic she loves so well. The content is fascinating, the way it is delivered is even more interesting.",1254614400,5,449,4.921052631578948
