8641930,5,B00IG4P3EA,"Fanny Ardant is the star in this lightweight comedy of infidelity and reawakened passion of sensuality: It is a love story from the French cinema that graces our non-Gallic screens in a refreshment of elegance by the French actress.

Bright Days Ahead is an activity club for the seniors, and Fanny Ardant who plays Caroline attends free classes with gift vouchers given to her as a present from her two daughters after Caroline takes early retirement as a dentist.

Carolines initial attendance at the club is not successful as she is apprehensive and feels estranged from enjoying the fun of the class-room activities: Her best friend died five months earlier and her early retirement was an unsavoury issue due to a bad working relationship with a former colleague.

It is only later at home when her husband complains of computer problems that Caroline will return the next day to attend a computer class for guidance to resolve the home issue of an internet connection: And here, with the attraction of a hypersexual tutor that a romance will inflame into passion.

Fanny Ardant will glide through the film with a graceful command of confidence as an actress: The new romance will excite into an oblivion sense of freedom from the constraints of marriage, and daytime routines of home life it is like a teenage love affair of attraction; except that the 60 year old Caroline, played by our French actress oozes command with experience of aged wisdom in a carefree freshness of living in the present: The film will reflect this idea throughout  and there is a lovely and sustained filming at the seaside beach with her grandchildren flying a colourful kite that is directed and willed only by the charm of the sea wind.

Eventually, the story of the new romance will want to uproot itself with desire to return home to foundation: The outcome is pleasantly rewarding to invigorate a renewal of life interest of itself: There is a lovely film score, with a buzz of romantic music to accord to the background melody. It was filmed at the seaside port of Dunkirk, which adds to the films attraction. I recommend the film for light entertainment in reminiscence of a nagging feeling of youthful past: But I also highly recommend Fanny Ardant who is a charming actress of the French cinema! Also stars, Patrick Chesnais as her husband, and Laurent Lafitte as her lover.

NB. Although this issue of the DVD has English subtitles, it has a very high price tag!",1466899200,,2457,4.808056872037914
8641931,4,B00IG4P3EA,"Delightful French fantasy: erotic without drifting into the truly romantic, lusty but never vulgar.

Our protagonist, played by Fanny Ardant, is eager to restore sparkle to her life, despite being a grandmother, married and with family. Her new lover is a colt young enough to be her son, and handsome all right and amusing, yet lightweight and essentially boy-toyish. Ardant, by contrast, brings her usual incandescent wattage onscreen, filling the proceedings almost completely with her will to escape the doldrums, to be moved and to live. His part is simpler: a bon vivant with no links, past or ties, hardly even a job (computer instructor), and barely a name (Julien).

Moral perspectives seldom preoccupy or are visited, but after a while realism intrudes with thoughts about others beyond the loose cavorting and indulgence onscreen. And yet it soon dawns that this, precisely, is *not* the stuff we sign up for in some movie-watching. Still, this wink and nudge toward escapism only holds for so long until reality intrudes again: she forgets to pick up her grandson, or discovers that her sweater's on inside out, tellingly.

When her husband gets wind of what's going on, he takes it well---so well that we are reminded that emotions are as rounded as outlined by the flick's makers (Marion Vernoux directed), and the premise here is that a young-hearted, still vital gal can evade the doldrums for a fun romp, no harm done. Without nagging the proceedings, then, reality keeps threatening to upset the fantasy, but not such as to shut down the yarn. After all, she's now alive! Who can begrudge her that? We'd rather not awaken from some dreams; well, not just yet.

In the end (spoilers ho!), things must unravel. In a sad yet not tragic turn, her inconstant lover wavers, true to their terms of mutual consent, calling things to a close. She does not object, and by the time the credits roll after her romp--and our vicarious one--she's back, resigned and just a bit saddened, among her husband and the quotidian and the pleasant, ready to search for ways to fill the vast emptiness. This returns her to the eponymous bright days ahead, and to caring for grandchildren, feminine companionship and hobby amusements.

Fanny Ardant has again chosen a well-suited role with exquisite taste, as so often before: strong women who balance warmth and dignity against a girlish taste for joy and frivolity. Even when playing a hooker (as in the 2006&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paris-je-t-aime-Paris-I-Love-You/dp/B000UVV26A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paris, je t'aime (Paris, I Love You)</a>, against Bob Hoskins--in easily his most endearing role), you know the fulsome woman she plays will pack some surprise and a healthy dollop of irony.

Another inspired flick from the French, currently in the thick of their second cinematic heyday. Make no mistake, beyond the truism that romance and intense living are only ever fleeting, this is the frothiest fluff ...yet of the best-made kind!",1425168000,,3041,5.234086242299795
8641932,2,B00IG4P3EA,"I bought this to see Fanny Ardant, who is always good..The story starts with a whimsical look at French people joining up at retirement
for group activities under the ""Bright Days Ahead"" theme of the promoting organization..We see the futility of programmed activities as
Ardant as Caroline runs into fools thinking that by sitting at the head of a class they can lord over their retiree students..But then as
a youngish computer instructor gets into the picture, we have an affair in the offing, but without motivation nor an ounce of excitement..
It is as if since the movie is French and Fanny's character Caroline is struggling to make sense of retirement, an affair would add spice
to the story line..Caroline's husband seems a stand up guy and quite sophisticated; they display no marital discord; so why a boy toy??
The young buck is a baby faced, shaggy haired bore who would offer really nothing to all but the most desperate women..But Caroline
goes along, hides the affair not well, and soon recognizes that her stud man considers her just a number in a bakery of goodies..Hubby
finds out and asks her the same question that the audience must be also asking:  What on earth are you thinking?? The movie has some
wonderful characters among the retirees and the sadness of ageing is front and center..Sadly, Fanny Ardant can add nothing to this..",1405036800,3,1355,4.815450643776824
