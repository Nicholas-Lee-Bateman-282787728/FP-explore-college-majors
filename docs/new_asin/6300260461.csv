7808415,5,6300260461,Oh man!! This movie is so bad it's fun to watch. It's so hysterical to see all these Italian actors playing American soldiers. The dubbing is even worse!!. The one good thing is the gore/violence. There is a lot of it. The opening scenes are funny with the Itali-American soldiers running around cursing up a storm and shooting themselves... It's a movie to watch while drinking beer. Not for one who watches a movie and thinks of homeless kids in France. It's for fans of Euro trash and people who want to laugh!!!,1175299200,,515,4.548387096774194
7808416,5,6300260461,"The late David Warbeck leads the way in the one and only TRUE Apocalypse Now ripoff made by the great masters of gore...the Italians!!!Filmed after the success of Apocalypse, this ""Ultra Gory"" spaguetti copycat of Francis Ford Coppola's Vietman war extravaganza is a real treat in its own way. A US mayor is sent to destroy an NVA communist radio broadcast that's being playing suversive brainwashing massages to the American G.I's... telling them to desert because the U.S.A. government are sending them to get killed for no reason and to fight a useless and cruel war that does not belong to them (this actually happened!!!). The gory action starts as soon as you play the movie. You will find great ""spaguetti-western"" style action scenes, lotz of ultra disturbing gore by horror fx master Gianetto de Rossi (Lucio Fulci's favorite!), insane and out of control shocking violence, cheesy dialogue and a storyline almost identical to Apocaypse Now...but without the huge overbudget. This very cool and entertaining cult flick stand out as one of the best spaguetti-vietnam movies of the late seventies-early eighties. If you are familiar with the once great Italian horror/action genre, then this will please your appetite for blood and gore. Some of the jungle and helicopter action is very good and so are the sets. Trust me, so you should not be disappointed...remember that this was made by the Italians...so this is CULT!!!. This lost cult classic, has already been released in Europe in an Uncut and Uncesored special edition PAL DVD...I'm hoping to find this amazing little shocker on NSTC DVD soon!!!! If you are a true fan of the spaguetti genre...this will bring a big smile on your face!",1076544000,,1699,5.007067137809187
