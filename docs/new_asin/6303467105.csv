8194136,5,6303467105,"I grew up watching tons of TV in the seventies, but only the shows that really had integrity and an attention to detail have remained. Speed Racer is one of these shows. It is crudely animated, but this in itself adds to  the tone -- it is set apart from the goofier cartoons of the day. Dramatic  to say the very least, this particular episode brings cult character Racer  X (Speed's older brother) to the fore and Speed's angst at not knowing who  he is and why he cares so much for him is brought out beautifully (the  writers really CARED for these characters!!). Even the 'cinematography' is  movielike. Oh yeah -- and it is great fun too!! (PS - Speed Racer fans and  collectors contact me. I live in the UK)",930873600,,714,4.363636363636363
