Bill Gaither gathers together many of the gospel greats for a day of singing & storytelling.  It was my understanding from the video that the Weatherford as well as Glen Payne & George Younce all sang at one time for Rex Humbard's Cathedral of Tomorrow.  Personally I love Lily Fern Weatherford's voice and Bill put together a quartet with Lily Fern, Earl Weatherford, Glen Payne & George Younce.  Such beautiful harmony.  The setting is casual, and there is a wonderful Narrative by Gloria Gaither talking about how she came from Michigan and only heard about some of the ""weird"" gospel music names when she met Bill.  It is a grat Narrative and she talks about how she had to wait to deliver her son while Bill was putting up posters for a quartet that was coming to town.  Very very funny.  One other note is that Earl Weatheford and Paul Downing died shortly after this filming and were not on any other videos.  Whenever I need a lift I get out Reunion and rejoice in the message of some of the greatest voices in gospel music.  Here is a short list of songs:

I'm Living in Canaan Now, George Younce, Vestal Goodman, James Blackwood, Ben Speer
Sheltered in the Arms of God - James Blackwood
In the Garden - Homecoming Friends
Child of the King - George Younce, Brock Speer (I was amazed at the blending of these voices)

He Touched Me - featuring Dottie Rambo
The Blood Will Never Lose Is Power - Michael English
Tell My Friends - Lily Fern Weatherford, Earl Weatherford, Glen Payne, George Younce.

What a Precious Friend is He - Earl & Lily Weatherford, Glen Payne, George Younce.
Little Is Much When GOd is in it - Larry Ford
Born to Serve the Lord - Vestal goodman
Tho'Autumn's Coming On - featuring Bill Gaither

and many more.  I have the original produced in 1992 by Star Song and it has been a blessing.  I am very pleased to see amazon offer it to those of you who love gospel music.",1259366400,15,2019,4.430894308943089

This makes me think about that great meeting on the other side, when we will all look so much better than the last time we saw one another.""  How fun it was to see everyone looking so vital.

8268811,5,B00187X2NG,This is a video about the old timers. The ones that made gospel music great. I enjoyed seeing a lot of singers who performed with Elvis Presley. There are a few tears from Gloria Gaither reading a letter to her husband Bill. Most of these performers are no longer with us so it really is a treasure. This is a great video to add to my huge Gaither collection. Thank you to the Gaither family.,1359763200,,392,4.24

8268814,5,B00187X2NG,"The Reunion Homecoming Celebration is not a compilation of clips from other shows; it is a complete gathering of the gospel greats and Homecoming Friends.  The few interviews are done in the Ryman Auditorium, original home of the Grand Ole Opry, where Bill Gaither points out his seat when he was a young boy in 8th grade and asked his parents to bring him to the all night gospel celebration in 1949.  Yes, that was an all-night celebration and Gaither was there all night, captivated by the gospel quartets in harmony, singing the Convention songs.

This celebration of gospel friends was taped in 1992, one of the earliest gatherings that included the old-timers  and the newer, up and coming Friends.  These younger ones, like Russ Taft, were in awe of the  presence in the room, those he always admired.

Many veterans are here, The Goodmans, the Weatherfords, Speer Family,  George Younce, Dottie Rambo, Hovie Lister, James Blackwood, Rex Nelon, the LeFevres, Henry Slaughter, Glen Payne, etc.

You will see footage from the Statesman Quartet and the Speer Family with Daddy Speer.

The Homecoming Friends sing I'd Rather Have Jesus  *  Give the World A Smile  *  In the Garden  *  I'm Living in Canaan Now  *  He Looked Beyond My Fault.  I like the very upbeat I've Got That Oldtime Religion in my Heart;  * I Never Shall Forget the Day,  Bill Gaither leads with the beautiful Through It All,  and Tho' Autumn's Coming.

The highlight is to have the group sing the beautiful and calming ""Sheltered in the Arms of God"".  James Blackwood speaks of his recent stroke and what his friends mean to him.

Vestal Goodman sings ""Born to Serve the Lord""  *  Hovie Lister, ""When he Calls I'll Fly Away"",  * ""He Touched Me"", Dottie Rambo  *  ""If the Lord Wasn't Walking by My Side"" features Henry Slaughter;  *  ""Tell My Friends"", and ""What A Precious Friend Is He"" with the Weatherfords, Payne, and Younce.

Like usual, Russ Taff does it again, with an emotional ""Hold To God's Unchanging Hand""  *  Others include, ""Little Is Much When God is In It"" with Larry Ford;  ""The Blood Will Never Lose It's Power"" with Michael English.

This is an historic get-together with the veterans present with the younger Homecoming members.
