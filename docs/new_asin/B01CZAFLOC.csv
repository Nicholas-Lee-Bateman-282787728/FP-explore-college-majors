7695002,4,B01CZAFLOC,"As a kid of the 90's, I grew up with the original Adventures in Babysitting. It has become a cult classic to me and I was kinda skeptical when I first saw the trailer for this new version. I watched it on tv, and I really quite enjoyed it. It'll never beat the original, but I thought it was fun and adorable and a decent movie to itself, but with a few references to the original.

The character of Chris Parker is now Jenny Parker, an up-tight by the books teen with a passion for art. Her world soon collides with Lola Perez, a fun loving rule breaking teen who also shares a love for art and photography. During an interview, they accidentally switch cell phones. Lola gets a call on Jenny's phones and says she'll pay double for a babysitter. While babysitting, the house almost catches on fire and one of the kids sneaks out to go see a concert. When Jenny realizes they switched phones, she shows up and takes control of the situation.

Instead of a Playboy with notes about stolen car parts, the kids are soon chased by bad guys because they took a picture of them with a rare Ferret that they stole. The bad guys are really dumbed down, like in the later Home Alone sequels. They chase them all night, which leads into the most iconic scene from the original film (Nobody leaves this place without singing the Blues) However, in this version, it has been upgraded to a babysitting rap battle between Jenny and Lola. Something I always love in movies is when two people start out on the odds with each other, then they slowly become friends as the movie progresses. This one does that pretty well.

If you're expecting it to be a scene-by-scene remake with all the character names as the original, you'll be disappointed, but if you're open minded, you might enjoy it. I would definitely recommend ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING!!!",1466899200,11,1834,4.518072289156627

7695006,3,B01CZAFLOC,"Instead of wasting your time watch this Disney nonsense, watch the 1987 Adventures un Babysitting with Elisabeth Shue

In this Disney version there were too many times when the action stopped so the actors could catch up so the prank could seem barely possible  running away from the villains but stop at the door you are going to hide behind etc; stand in the street so long that the villains have time to see you & try to steal your camera etc",1517443200,3,445,4.414634146341464

7695016,5,B01CZAFLOC,"This is quite a fun movie, parts of it don't make sense, but they put the plot in motion.  Basically Jenny, an attractive, been skipped a grade, intelligent, well groomed, polite, sensible and responsible girl is attending an artist apprentice summer job interview, as she knows this will round out her college application.  Also there is Lola, a rougher doesn't conform to the rules girl who wants to be an artist but didn't put much effort in at school, clearly doesn't know how you should behave at an interview, and just does what she wants, says what she wants without a filter. Of course the two don't really get along in the waiting room. After physically clashing both girls accidentally end up with each others phones. Lola gets a parking ticket and suddenly needs cash when Jenny's phone rings.  It's the woman who had previously rung Jenny in the job interview (why Jenny would have had her phone on in an interview didn't make sense but anyway), the woman pleads with who he thinks is Jenny, does she really not know any other responsible babysitters as she'll happily pay double, (Jenny was already booked with another family).  Lola in need of cash agrees thinking it'll be pretty cruisey.  However as soon as the parents are gone Lola goes to use the hot tub, the place catches on fire, Jenny rings her own phone, one of the kids answers and tells her about the fire, she rushes over with the kids she's babysitting.  Meanwhile the teenage boy in Lola's care has snuck away to attend a concert in the city.  The two load all the kids into the rich parents large expensive 4WD and head to the city to get him back.  They will soon become the target of two criminals (of Home Alone intelligence), who will chase them, now carless across the city. All the kids of course have their own issues that need to be dealt with along the way.

Lola never asked the mother who thought she Jenny what her address was, yet somehow turned up there.  Didn't see why it was Jenny's problem to risk her own reputation, or waste her time to find the teen who had snuck out, all she needed to do was call his parents and tell them she is not friends with a girl who she met at an artist job interview who took her phone by mistake.  If she'd done that, the other parents might have asked her to go find him and she could have met them at the function to give her whatever money was needed. Plus I didn't get why they didn't take both babysitter's cars, they would have fit the kids in both.  I also wondered why as soon as either girl realised they had the others phone they didn't ring the other one and get their phone back.  Phones are most teenage girls lives, I can't imagine each could go too long without needing it.

It's a fun adventure, made as a family target market film, so you know nothing bad will happen to anyone.  Does maybe send a message that stealing money is okay at one point, but other than that which parents can discuss with kids anyway, this is a film you could leave kids watching and walk away.  But it's also a film that entertaining enough for adults as well.",1512259200,,3085,4.414462081128748

With that being said I personally thought this movie was Disney trying to destroy Sabrina Carpenter's career or something. This movie was laughable after the first five minutes. Not that it was funny it was laughable and a little sad. Disney made so much hype and delivered so little with this movie. Looking forward to Sabrina Carpenter doing some family movies away from Disney. Hopefully she will.",1504310400,,550,4.445544554455446

Amazon had a  .99 cent special for Labor Day for 7 day rental and I've enjoyed taking advantage of all Seven days.

7695135,5,B01CZAFLOC,"During the early going it felt as if it were struggling to find itself.  It is living in the shadow of a surprise hit from almost 30
summers ago that made Elizabeth Shue a star after all. Interestingly enough, the scene that kicks the movie up a notch is their take on the most iconic scene from the original: Babysitter Blues (here Babysitter Battle). From this point the film truly shines.  Kudos for creating cute subplots for each of the kids.  I especially enjoyed the little homage to Maia Brewton and Vincent D'onfrio;s characters by having the one character on skates and hero worshiping a superhero like character.  For those who missed it the tow place is named Dawson, just like in the original. One more homage:"" don't mess with the babysitter."" Nicely inserted into the flow of things.  All in all well worth a viewing or two.",1470268800,4,839,4.641891891891892
