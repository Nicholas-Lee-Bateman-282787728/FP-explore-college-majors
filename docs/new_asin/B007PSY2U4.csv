5103462,5,B007PSY2U4,Loved it! This is well worth your time. The film focuses on a team of blackjack players who count cards in casinos and win millions. It's a great story! The special features on this disc are great too!,1348790400,,201,4.315789473684211
5103463,5,B007PSY2U4,This was a very well done documentary and really made me think about a lot of things. It talks about how to count cards but mostly focuses on pre-conceived notions of what Christianity is or isn't.,1340064000,3,197,4.5

8520631,4,B007PSY2U4,"I have to give the product itself a 5 star as that was great, but I'm putting 4 as a warning for content. This movie was not as I expected. They never really get to the bottom of spiritual justification of what they're doing. They just kind of talk about their life in gambling but only scrape the surface of their Christianity. I thought it would get deeper than it did. Oh, well...",1423872000,,383,4.260273972602739

8520633,5,B007PSY2U4,"This was a more realistic treatment of card counting than other movies. The costumes and other antics to fool pit bosses were funny. Hidden camera footage gives good insight.

Don't let the pit boss see your lips move.

8520634,4,B007PSY2U4,"Engaging documentary about a group of card-counting Christian blackjack players who, financed by some backers, aspire to go to casinos and using the skill of card-counting pull $ from casinos.

In the early scenes we see them celebrate as they reach certain levels.  They eventually have a non-Chrisitan join who they eventually think is stealinging.

As it goes along it is sad as we see some of the players lie to get into casinos to play as they have been banned, some wear costumes.  Some players appear to lose their talent and are dismissed. Engaging and interesting, a character study. They admit exposure breaks a person down.",1355529600,2,634,4.897196261682243
8520635,5,B007PSY2U4,"After watching this film, I think I'm ready to grab some friends and go to the casino and practice card counting!",1349308800,,113,4.428571428571429
8520636,5,B007PSY2U4,I enjoyed this film more than I expected!  I learned so much about the gambling industry and blackjack in particular.,1349308800,,117,4.85
8520637,5,B007PSY2U4,"Intriguing movie, I really enjoyed the special features. I told all my friends about this after i got done watching it. I have always known about the concept of card counting but I thought it was  something that only mathematicians and savants could do!",1349049600,,253,4.75
8520638,5,B007PSY2U4,"This video definitely presents some things that are worth thinking about. At first I was expecting a crappy version of 21 but this video did a great job of describing the ins and outs of blackjack while delving into the much deeper issue of what does it mean to be a ""christian.""",1348790400,,279,4.384615384615385
8520639,5,B007PSY2U4,"This documentary shows the ins and outs of a blackjack team. This is normally a very secretive world, but the team opens up to the cameras and tells their secrets.",1348790400,,163,4.466666666666667
