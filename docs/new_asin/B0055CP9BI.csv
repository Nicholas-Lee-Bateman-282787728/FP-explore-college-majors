4573755,5,B0055CP9BI,This movie was fantastic to watch.  I was shocked that I would like it but I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice.,1316822400,,115,3.7916666666666665
4573756,3,B0055CP9BI,"i don't have any backstory to this film.....but it clearly should've been a trilogy.  the first two parts were very well done....and at the end of what SHOULDVE BEEN the film's climax....it keeps going.  i don't understand why.  the part after the climax should've been an entirely different film.

it was good....don't get me wrong....but after the main struggle driving the main part of the story is concluded...it should have ENDED....but for some reason the filmmakers decided to keep it going.  i am having a tough time grasping why they went in that direction.  maybe the director saw Ip Man 2 and felt inspired?  the ""final"" final scene in this film defnitely doesn't compare to the final scene in Ip Man 2.

so maybe just watch the first 2/3 of this film....then go rent Ip Man 2. :]",1316736000,,791,4.681159420289855
4573757,5,B0055CP9BI,"Man from second one of the film it was terrific all the way to the end! I enjoyed it so much I am calling this movie 2011's top rated film so far! The fighting skills are incredible. The action is nonstop. I cried a couple times too because there is some real love in this movie! Oh man the special effects are incredible just like ""crouching tiger , hidden dragon."" My highest esteem to all who made this movie! Brilliant!",1316649600,5,423,4.3
4573758,5,B0055CP9BI,"I watched this movie a few months ago while I was on deployment. A buddy in my shop had a bootleg copy and at the time I had no idea what the movie was called. After googling the plot and some quotes I finally figured out it was True Legend.

Anyway I really enjoyed the movie as a whole. Great fight scenes and interesting story (although the story itself is pretty depressing). The background scenery and cinematography were amazing.

If you're a Yuen Woo-ping fan (The Matrix trilogy, Kill Bill Volumes I and II, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero, Iron Monkey, Drunken Master) or just like martial arts movies in general then I'd recommend checking out this movie.

I've got this pre-ordered now and I'm really looking forward to watching a legit copy on blu-ray.",1314662400,24,768,4.674074074074074
4573759,3,B0055CP9BI,"...it's a bit depressing, quite frankly. I don't know, maybe it's because I'm not a native Chinese viewer like this film seems to have been clearly created for (there's been a crop of extremely nationalistic Chinese and HK martial arts films that've come out over the last few years that more or less paint any and all foreigners as devils and cartoonish villains), but I've been an avid consumer of both Chinese and HK martial arts films for a good 12 years, now, and this may've been the most depressing one I've seen to date. It does, however, end on a high note and, of course, the fight choreography is nothing less than spectacular, which is no surprise since Yuen-Woo Ping is directing.

Similar recent films include Jet Li's Fearless (which also includes fight choreography by the legendary fight choreographer), Ip Man 1 and 2, and Legend of the Fist, all of which are worth viewing at least once, the latter three starring Donnie Yen. For an older similar film, there's the Jet Li/Yuen Woo-Ping classic, Fist of Legend, which treats foreigners a bit more fairly, IMHO, and is actually a prequel of sorts to Legend of the Fist.",1314144000,5,1136,4.708542713567839
4573760,5,B0055CP9BI,"Great fight scenes. The story is delivered in two(2) parts, so you might feel lost at times. The hero is great. The bad guy is equally great. The scenery is spectacular!",1313366400,2,169,4.483870967741935
4573761,4,B0055CP9BI,"Great action movie but kind of too violence , Ok for martial art fan",1286409600,,68,3.9285714285714284
4573762,1,B0055CP9BI,"The movie started off very well, with a strong storyline of revenge and betrayal.  The fight scenes are choreographed by the same man who put the MATRIX martial art scenes on the map.  I was blown away by the spectacular martial arts scenes in this movie.

The final confrontation between the protagonist and antagonist is where the movie should have ended, but it does not end there.  I would have expected that once the protagonist discovered where the villains hid his wife as their prisoner, the movie would end right there...BUT NOOOOO...they messed up the movie BIG TIME!

After the protagonist defeats the antagonist and finds his imprisoned wife, the movie suddenly shifts to a China being influenced by ""foreigners"".  Absolutely nothing to do with the story which we had been watching up to that point.  Even my 17-year old son, who has very dubious taste in movies (blame it on his ""inexperienced years"" of movie watching) looked at me and we both exclaimed ""What in the world just happened to this movie?""  Just imagine if you had walked out to go to the bathroom right after the protagonist locates his wife, then walked back a few minutes later to the theater while the movie was still playing.  I am sure that 100% of people who did that would say ""Did I just walk into the wrong theater?  This CAN'T be the movie I was just watching!""  I also wouldn't be surprised if more than half of those people decided to walk out trying to get their bearings, trying to figure out where they may have made a wrong turn.  It is as if the producers decided to just slap two in-congruent movies together just to make the movie long enough.

The ""transition"" to the China being influenced by ""foreigners"" is the weakest part of the movie.  It was pleasant to see David Carradine in these final minutes of the film, but I would have liked to see the producers add more depth into his role.  They probably intended to, but David Carradine's unexpected death probably prevented that (just as Heath Ledger's unexpected death provided challenges to the producers of ""The Dark Knight"", but they somehow pulled a miracle rabbit out of the hat and were still able to make ""The Dark Knight"" work with the scenes they already filmed...didn't seem so with ""True Legend"" though).  Also, to see the movie's protagonist being bested by only three ""foreign"" fighters in the arena just didn't sit well with me.  Why?  Come on...the protagonist defeated scores of enemy fighters during the beginning of the movie, and even defeated the super powerful antagonist to boot!  Then I am to believe that the protagonist can be defeated by three ""foreign"" fighters whose expertise in martial arts is nowhere as strong as the adversaries he faced earlier?

Another strong recommendation to the producers...there were just TOO MANY SCENES devoted to the son yelling out in anguish ""Dad, get up!  Dad!"" or ""Dad, don't die!  Dad!""  His cries just became too sickening to watch.  ENOUGH ALREADY!

If you like to watch martial arts scenes, then this movie is a must watch.  If you expect a good strong story, I would say ""Well, yes and no"".  The story is strong all the way up to the part the protagonist finds his wife (which is right after the final conclusion between the protagonist and antagonist).  I feel that if you walk away from the movie right after that, you would have a good feeling about the movie.  The movie would have had FIVE stars from me up to that point.  Then it just gets totally down hill from there (hence the reason it goes from FIVE to ONE star for me...that is how awful I thought about the way they slapped this movie together).  If you feel you MUST watch the final part of the movie just for the sake of seeing David Carradine's final movie appearance before he died, I'd say ""Do it"", but be forewarned that it may sour your overall experience of this movie (as it did mine).  Also, the scenes they had David Carradine doing is probably not a strong enough reason to continue watching the movie, because they seemed to have relegated a very minor role for him (don't know if that was intentional or not, because of his sudden death in real life).",1276214400,6,4148,4.632010943912449

4573774,2,B0055CP9BI,"***SPOILERS***

I REALLY wanted to like this movie. And for the first 90 minutes I did. Some of the CG was pretty bad but they didn't rely on it too much. You are initially serves up a very modern take on some good old fashioned Kung Fu cinema fun. Shaw Brothers would have been proud and clearly the producers were SB fans as the villain was a master of the ""Five Venom Fist"". The costumes were gorgeous, kung fu choreography top notch and final battle one for kung fu cinema record books. Then we hit ""chapter 2"" and it's all downhill from there.

Chapter 2 the ""Drunken Fist"" is a hodgepodge of Ip Man meets Drunken Master but done very very poorly. The protagonist has lost his wife and turns to wine to drown his sorrows at which point he accidently discovers the drunken fist style of kung fu then uses it to best the ""undefeatable"" forgein/western wrestlers.

The Second Part of this seems  like  a  completely different story. The beautiful cinematography and costumes suddenly dissappear, even the architecture changes and we have a very incohesive story that has nothing to do with the first 90 minutes. Why why why didn't they just stop after the battle with the brother-in-law is beyond me. Could have 3nded it there and had a good claim on a modern day martial arts master piece instead of throwing it all down the crap per in the second part.",1437350400,,1356,4.536885245901639

And then the final part of the movie happened, with the requisite crying child screaming for daddy every 3 seconds; mawkish, maudlin, cloying and saccharine.

4573796,4,B0055CP9BI,"True Legend is a highly stylized hybrid kung-fu/wire-fu/battlefield-fu/folk hero/fantasy/supernatural epic of a film and directed by a true legend, renowned choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping. This is a very unique film and a blast to watch, breaking the molds by not being held to any particular kung-fu sub-genre.

The movie is chocked full of great cameo appearances including Michelle Yeoh as a sort of medicine woman, Master Gordon Liu as Old Sage and David Carradine among others. It would have been fitting to see Jet Li as the God of Wushu, or Jackie Chan as the Drunken Master, but that might have been asking a bit much. Like the poster suggests, True Legend was going for a little of the 'old skool' kung-fu cinema feel and you could definitely tell there was some Shaw Brothers influence in the movie. While the CG isn't exactly the best, I really appreciated the blend of martial arts, wire-fu and digital effects to provide a well rounded experience.

The cinematography in the film was outstanding, particularly the scenes of rural China, and helped contribute to a distinct feel in the movie. Each primary character, especially the evil brother with the skill of the 5 deadly venoms, in one way or another fell into a classic kung-fu archetype, like the drunken master (notable to mention that Ping directed the 1978 film Drunken Master starring a young Jackie Chan). The best fight scene of the movie unconventionally comes at just over the halfway point, where the brothers duel it out to the death.",1400630400,3,1510,4.91764705882353

4573834,5,B0055CP9BI,"I can't say enough good things about this film. It has a well written plot. It is epic in scope. Themes of loyalty,revenge,duty,familial and brotherly love are all well covered. Vincent Zhao is superb here. This is one of the best martial arts films I have seen in recent times.",1359590400,2,278,4.58
4573835,3,B0055CP9BI,"If you like martial arts movies with lots of action, including wrestling, this is a great movie to watch.  It is a legend of the martial art warrior who is forced to abandon his peaceful life of a devoted husband and a father when his evil and vindictive stepbrother decides to destroy him.  Michelle Yeoh and David Carradine make guest appearances in this film, but amazingly enough, they have roles that require not fighting.  I liked their quiet presence on screen.

In any case, movie goes over the top with fighting scenes.  One almost wishes for good old times when Bruce Lee movies were in fashion.  I liked wonderful costumes and gentle and graceful depiction of female characters.  Great spectacle and entertainment.  Do not expect more than that.",1356998400,3,756,4.8515625

If you don't know who  Yuen Woo Ping is.. he is man behind Matrix, Crouching Tiger and lots of the famous fighting scene. His father was well respected kung fu master in Hong Kong. He and his brothers continue to operate a school. Since they so well known, most directors consultants him for advice on movie thus how they got into the movie business.

4573840,5,B0055CP9BI,I enjoyed the entire film. The only problem is.. I can't believe I'm just watching it now. I grew up watching Kung Fu theater back in the day.. back when we had no cable. These film's will always be entertaining for me even the not so good ones. Check it out and you will enjoy it and if not.. well then  just stick with your Steven Seagal movies.,1353801600,,347,4.102941176470588
4573841,5,B0055CP9BI,"Okay so the story line is so-so... and it's quite fantasy but the fight choreography was EXCELLENT!!  So, it totally makes up for the anything else the movie may lack in.  The quality was good and the fast paced straight up fist action, held your attention.",1350518400,,257,4.565217391304348
4573842,2,B0055CP9BI,"Perhaps my opinion is bias because I'm not into the specific type of action this movie has. The high flying wire kung fu just doesn't do it for me. That being said the movie was captivating up to the half way mark. The story really drags out. They develop it very well at first, then linger for a long time so you can see characters fight in the same setting 5 or 6 times, then dive back into the story for a very brief wrap up to the story and THEN have some really strange second part that's basically a stand alone short story that is barely tied to the first. (It's as if they tacked on a 30 minute version of Ip Man 2 to the end of it). I found myself quite bored and barely able to sit through anything past the 45 minute mark.

Watch instead: Ip Man and Ip Man 2. The fighting is edge of your seat spectacular (though a completely different style) and the story in both is well developed and fulfilling.

***possible spoiler below***

The story basically pauses and stays in the same spot for the greater part of the movie. Su and Ying stay at a Doctor's house on the mountain for TWO YEARS and he spends the entire time fighting in the same little cliff arena. You get to see him fight the god of Wushu 6 times in the same place. Each time different weapons are used but come on! I don't want to see the same action sequence over and over, and that's what it felt like. Also, you see this Doctor they're living with makes an appearance around 4 times. I understand that she's not essential to the story but with absolutely nothing other than shots of Ying making wine, Su training, and one or the other being a drunk mess for 45 minutes it's hard to keep interest. And then the weird second story? There's not a whole lot of flow or continuity to this film at ALL. If all you're looking for is two guys flying at each other and smashing rocks in the process then this film will definitely deliver.",1345766400,2,1905,4.213698630136986

4573844,4,B0055CP9BI,"I enjoy martial art films alot.  Saying that, I also enjoyed this film.  It was a nice twist on a chinese legend, that lets the viewer come to some of their own conclusions.  The action in the film was very good, and if you enjoy high wire action movies, you should like this one.  The filming was also very well done and enjoyable and colorful.",1341619200,,345,4.2615384615384615
4573845,4,B0055CP9BI,"Really enjoyed the movie in all of its parts. The fight scenes were really fun, though there was a lot of wire-fu, so if you are looking for realism this isn't the movie for you.  I didn't mind the wire-fu and it lent some fun to the story.  The only real gripe I have with the movie is the transition between what could have easily been the end of the movie to the third act.  If that had been handled a bit better I would have given this a five star rating.",1340323200,,459,3.967391304347826

With our without popcorn. This movie was last appearance of David Carradine, although he doesn't fight, of course. Way too gray for that. Interesting movie, to say the very least.",1339200000,,344,4.564516129032258
4573847,3,B0055CP9BI,"This is a pretty strange flick. Part of it is very now and wow while other parts read like director Hark Tsui's ""Zu Warrior"" or ""Once Upon a Time in China.""

Here's the scoop. Su Can is a great warrior. He and his brother in law, Yuan Lie, finish a particularly grueling battle and Su wants to hang it up and start a school teaching the Wushu style of fighting. He takes his wife and son and heads off to the big city. Yuan, in the meantime, is starting to fume. He has always felt like a second fiddle to Su so he loads up on venom from various creatures and perfects a way to deliver it via the Five Fingers of Death. He now goes after Su and it leads to a really big mess.

This is a pretty wild ride. The opening battle uses a lot of CGI and looks as though it came from a poor man's version of ""The Lord of the Rings."" It then shifts to something more like ""Zu Warrior"" with the over exaggerated wire work, the white haired mystical dude and the ""God"" who will put Su through the paces to get him back up to speed after losing a fight with Yuan. I don't know where this genre is these days. I don't see enough of these to tell, but seeing a guy kick a big rock into pebbles isn't anything I've seen in ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.""

The story is pretty good but it takes an odd turn. It's two hours long but the first part ends in 90 minutes then veers off to an entirely different chapter where Su becomes an alcoholic and, through a changing socio-political condition in China, begins to develop the ""drunken fist"" method of fighting. It caught me way off guard.

I liked this movie enough. Good story and direction. Good sets and costumes with a decent score. Michelle Yeow is on hand but has a woefully small, underwritten part. Some of what is portrayed is supposed to be based on fact but the viewer can tell that great liberties were taken in the telling.

It's a fun watch, but if you're not a fan of the genre, you might end up going WTF?!",1335830400,12,1966,4.163157894736842
4573848,3,B0055CP9BI,"I bought this movie primarily for the action, so I had low expectations for the story.
However I felt the story direction was so bad that it still made me cringe. The action, although fun, was not enough to overshadow the horrible script.

It felt like two movies bandaged together, one where the protagonist tries to overcome a tragedy, then the next when foreigners have arrived in China and are challenging the efficacy of martial arts compared to western weapons and well...physical size (wrestlers).

The transitions of the protagonist in overcoming his inner demons was just weird and sloppily done.",1335657600,,605,5.04

The story was a little disjointed which made for a downgraded review but the acting was good for this kind of flick, the action was amazing (which if it wasn't for the action the movie would not be good), and visuals (which enhanced the action and overall feel of the movie) made this a must see for those enthusiasts of martial arts and foreign films.",1326153600,,572,4.116071428571429

formulaic story of betrayal....exile....training sequences....revenge...

Bascially this is the fictional story of Su Can, aka ""Beggar Su,"" who invented drunken boxing.  Of course this was preceded by his brother-in-law killing his father and later his wife, the loss of his life as a teacher, his descent into madness (as in ""A Beautiful Mind""), and finally his becoming a drunk and homeless father.

After seeing the trailer I imediatly rented it and watched on my 27"" Moniter.

  Just the action sequences are top Notch.  Very Very well done.  There is some developed story.  I think the story was pretty good, perhaps overlong developing in some parts.  I could see this catch on as a cult Martial arts film - the Fight Scenes and action are that good.

 Do note that this is a subtitled film with very small parts in english.  I plan on Buying this film after viewing it on the 48 Hour Rental
