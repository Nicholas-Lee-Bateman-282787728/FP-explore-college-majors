8529822,3,B000LAZDPQ,"I enjoy working out, I like variety, and I enjoy mixing up my cardio and strength workouts.  It's an unforeseen bonus if the workout instructor is unintentionally hilarious (for more of the same, see anything by Denise Austin, and Billy Blanks is pretty awesome too).
This was a gem I took out from my local library, and initially, upon viewing the 80s-ish set and workout gear of the participants, I was unsure of how much I'd like it (i.e. how much lameness I could endure). The instructor's energetic yips and in-rhythm-with-the-music cueing, the other participants super-enthusiastic smiling, the crazy amount of jumping jacks - it's like a Junior Senior album!  I did find her energy contagious, though, and although it was a pretty intense cardio workout, I had a good time.  Highly recommended for lovers of physical fitness and campiness.",1239667200,5,846,5.0285714285714285
