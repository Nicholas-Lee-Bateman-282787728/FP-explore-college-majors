8574478,5,B00BV9JDNY,"I was looking for a video about Augustine for a Sunday school class, and this fills the bill very well.  It is long enough to cover the subject meaningfully and short enough to show in one session.  The details are correct and the presentation is very good.  The only improvement would be to give a more thorough coverage of his controversies (Donatists and Pelagius) and the great effect of his writing on future generations.",1378598400,5,426,4.72972972972973
