My copy of this is a DVD purchased from another source that specializes in hard-to-find movies. Scott Bakula's performance was ""ok"", but Loggia's performance really was what made this film worthwhile, in my opinion!",1525824000,,349,5.25

7856120,4,6303878318,"Gripping story but overdone ending.  Based on a true rescue, but diverged from the true event in the latter stages of the movie.  The small plane pilot never actually made visual contact with the jetliner, and eventually landed at Norfolk Island not Auckland.  I still heartily recommend the movie.",1404518400,,298,5.040816326530612

7856122,5,6303878318,"If I were stranded on a desert island, this is one of the top half dozen films I'd want with me.  I've lost track of how many times I've watched it over the years,  and it never fails to reach me.  Robert Loggia should've had an award for his portrayal of the old-time airline captain, especially when he puts his Boy Scout training to good use.  It starts off a bit slowly, but gathers momentum and once it picks up speed, it's riveting:  It grabs the viewer and never lets go.  Anyone -- male or female -- who can watch this film without crying tears of joy at the climax isn't human.
The fact that it is based on an actual event adds to its authenticity.",1251504000,,657,4.174603174603175
7856123,5,6303878318,I love this movie.  I have from the first time I saw it.  It is a movie that reminds you ... the chances we take are risks sometimes.  and sometimes the Risks are a turning point for life.  Drama filled you will cheer this one on and hope for the best.  Its a must have for me during Christmas and always,1231200000,,304,3.918032786885246
7856124,5,6303878318,"As an avid aviaton/flying enthusiast I can honestly say its one of my favourite movies of the type. Riveting throughout. Want to buy it on dvd, but can't understand why it isn't available yet.",1143158400,8,192,4.676470588235294
7856125,5,6303878318,"This film, based on a true events, is riveting. It's a story of courage, of ingenuity, of refusing to give up.  Scott Bakula and Robert Loggia are exceptional as the main characters.  This is a film you can watch over and over.",1028160000,10,227,4.380952380952381
7856126,5,6303878318,"My family thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  We had seen it many times in the past on TV usually around Christmas time.  The theme of the movie it set around Christmas time, so that is when it would be shown on TV.  But the past year it was not on, or at least we missed it.  The movie is a delight, filled with emotion and hardship.  But the courage of one man who decided he was not willing to let another man perish just because he had to take some risks to save him.  The movie is a real feel good story, and one you will want to watch over and over again.  Especially if you like stories about men and airplanes, this is one not to be missed.",1025222400,13,644,3.984375
