3517909,1,B001CT876C,"When I knew a sequel to Sleepaway Camp was coming out, I was thrilled.  I figured with the movie technology we have these days, it should be a great thing to see the horror franchise updated 20 or so years.  I was wrong.  It's as if they took the original ""actors"" and aged them for a poorly written, very predictable sequel.  Ronnie and Ricky were horribly written and even more terribly acted.  The other actors didn't even carry the movie with their talent, because they didn't have any either... poor Vincent Pastore had to do it all alone.  I get how this was supposed to have the feel of the original, but it was almost too similar.  I missed the way I didn't know who the killer in the original was until half-way through and even then was still shocked by a great ending.  In this version, I knew immediately who the killer was, which led to an expected ending.  The entire movie left me feeling embarrassed that I actually spent as much money as I did on it, as well as the time it took to watch it.  This was not worth the 20+ year wait.  Save your money and your time.",1225929600,5,1079,4.266009852216749

3517912,5,B001CT876C,"The most interesting low budget slasher in the past few years! So fantastic to see a direct sequel to the movie that started the franchise with such a twisted horror plot capped with a truly shocking end.
I love parts 2 and 3 but to see part one continued with the same direction and tone has pleased me to no end.
I have been lucky to have received the DVD early so I can confirm a few things, one: it looks amazing in HD quality and two it is only actually 86 mins long not 98 minutes as stated on many websites (including this one)
anyways to summarise the movie: campy low budget horror fun with a brilliantly pulled off 80's tone, creative murders, offbeat characters and a nasty little end (that'll teach him to mess with frogs!)
The low points however are: not enough of a bodycount for a sleepaway camp movie and also whatever mystery there is, is VERY easy to figure out, if you haven't seen the leaked ending thats been out for ages then I'm sure you will still work out how this movie will end, but.... you'll still have a blast doing it!",1225238400,,1049,4.303030303030303
3517913,5,B001CT876C,"I've been very excited about watching this, ever since I heard about it. I checked the IMDB almost daily for updates, and was constantly irritated that the release date kept getting pushed back. But I finally got to see it.

There's no cold open, straight to the credits. When I was watching the credits, they looked really good, and I was thinking to myself, ""Wow, this is going to be a real movie. High production quality, etc."" Then, the actual movie started, and it looked just like the last one.

I enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought they did a great job of making it a sequel, which is hard to do when the first one was made 25 years ago. It has the same feel, same style of writing, like it was made a year or two later.

Isaac Hayes is an awful actor, and Jonathan Tierston has only done one other thing aside from the first one, and that was in 1987. He is definitely not an actor. Vincent Pastore does a really good job. I was disappointed that Aunt Martha didn't make a cameo. She did something in 2006, but other than that, only the original.

If you were a fan of the first movie, I think you'll totally dig this one.",1224633600,20,1131,4.222222222222222

I just noticed a review on here stating that this movie was the full version of that craptacular ""Sleepaway Camp: The Survivor"" footage that was an extra in some of the Survival Kit Box Sets.  This movie has absolutely NO relation to that.  Return To Sleepaway Camp is a direct sequel to the unforgettable original Sleepaway Camp.  Ronnie and Ricky are back and so are a bunch of gruesome murders at camp.

3517929,1,B001CT876C,"Several teens are trying to enjoy their stay in Camp Manabe which is head by Frank Kostic (Vincent Pastore). One of the staff members comes up missing and later someone is killed. This leads Ronnie (Paul DeAngelo) to believe that the killings are being committed by Angela Baker (Felissa Rose), whom was guilty of the murders on Camp Arawak decades ago; but apparently there's proof Angela is still locked up. -summary

The original 1983 Sleepaway Camp was no way a masterpiece and was at best, maybe a slightly above average slasher which delivered one of the best and surprising endings in horror. It was the more serious movie of the bunch despite some weird death sequences, but really couldn't be considered anything to be a horror comedy. The sequels to follow however were by far different from their predecessor, as they took a drastic turn towards being horror comedies, which eventually lead to Sleepaway Camp becoming a joke of a franchise to many. I longed for the day to see this series return to its dark roots. Unfortunately, the wait will have to continue since Return to Sleepaway Camp is just about as absurd is the original sequels following in their comedic foot steps, but this one is by far the worst and can definitely be a chore to get through.

One thing about this movie that bothered me the absolute most is the characters; I mean with the exception of maybe one or two, this entire cast is beyond unlikable and the rotten script does nothing to make them the least bit redeemable. Most of the plot, in fact too much of it follows a bi-polar kid by the name of Allan (Michael Gibney) whom is disliked by everyone and is often picked on. The viewer would probably be able to sympathize with him if only he wasn't a jerk himself. How anyone can come away liking Alan even remotely is beyond me. In fact, I can imagine 99.9999% of the audience hoping he bites it and very early too.

I can't harp enough on these annoying characters, but seriously none of them screamed ""disembowel me now!"" more than Alan. Fortunately a couple of these annoying pest do get it and on some occasions the pay off is worth it. Now the Sleepaway Camp sequels, especially the third movie took great pride in those psychotic Bugs Bunny deaths. This movie delivers some of them also and despite professional magazines brushing all the deaths off as uncreative trash. There's maybe one or two worth a mention.

The deaths no matter how well deserved or even a little funny does not save this bomb even in the least. First off the kills are too spread apart; and taking their place are long filler scenes of bullying and pathetic attempts at character development for a guy everyone is going to hate in the first five minutes. (I'm talking about you Alan!) There's almost nothing to hold one's interest unless they are abnormally easy to please or just love bad movies, and believe me when I say this movie is bad. Director Robert Hiltzik does go to some length to give nostalgic fans something, by bringing back certain characters to reprise their roles from the original movie, in which this is what Return to Sleepaway Camp actually follows ignoring all of the sequels. He also does a semi-decent job concealing whom the killer is or could be. Some people may catch it quick, some will not. Sadly, these elements do very little to enhance enjoyment.

In closing, Return to Sleepaway Camp is rubbish all around to be brutally honest. The tiny bit of good the movie manages to pull off is outright wrecked by all of the bad. Some of the kills aren't worth waiting for, and the filler for characters I'm sure everyone will hate certainly doesn't help matters. The original Sleepaway Camp will probably always be the best, and to those unfamiliar with the series I recommend starting there and ignoring everything that comes after it, especially if horror comedies aren't your thing. There is a reboot in the works though, and I really hope it goes back to its original character. As for this movie, my advice is to leave it alone.

Pros: A decent kill here and there

Cons: Overly wretched and pretty much nothing worthwhile.",1427673600,,4124,4.6643741403026135

3517931,3,B001CT876C,"Not the best or worst movie.  Positives are some of the original cast are back and a half way descent story.  Some negatives-- the acting was pretty bad, some really bad death scenes and effects.  The boy who is the center of the movie is super annoying and hard to have sympathy for; not like in the first movie where you feel that the people are deserving of payback.

Personally, I thought this was was a pretty fun one, but only if you're in the mood for something light-hearted and you don't expect anything more than you've already gotten in the previous movie. The SC franchise really seems to have a love-hate relationship with the horror fan base. People either ""get"" it and are on board for cheesy jokes, cheesy acting, and cheesy kills, and love em, or they really, truly hate em. This one, for me, is the second best, after the original (which, while the same humor-wise) has one of the freakiest and most memorable final 30 seconds of any horror film ever made.

Vincent Pastore is such a great actor,I'm so suprised he participated in something like this. Even the worst reviews,weren't bad enough. Please save your money and time",1396224000,3,429,4.3625

3517946,3,B001CT876C,"It had the same feel as the first one in terms of how it was shot and the acting. The acting and dialogue was straight out of 1983 and the cheesetasticness made that part great. It was hard to feel bad for the main character at times in my opinion. In the original, you feel bad for what Angela went through and the s*** she got at camp. In this, they did not explain or even mention what Alan's issues might be. I also did not think this movie gave enough explanation of what happened to Angela and Ricky after the first movie. Most of what is explained comes in the beginning when they are flashing newspaper articles. I would advise someone who watches this to pause and read them. If you don't do that you won't know what happened to Aunt Martha or the additional information regarding Angela and Ricky not mentioned in the movie. An explanation of how the killer came up with this plan and more description of why would be cool. Overall though it is a decent watch and I hope they may make a sanctioned third sequel that has been announced yet like this one was, it is already 2 years past due.",1366416000,2,1099,4.288461538461538

I thought this horror comedy was a fun guilty pleasure. Critics and Sleepaway Camp fans consider this film the worst installment in the series. Kids and camp counselors at Camp Manabe are getting butchered. People suspect that a fat kid named Alan is doing the killing. This film delivers gory death scenes and lots of foul language! The film stars Vincent Pastore, Isaac Hayes, Johnathan Tierston and Felissa Rose. This film is packed with pretty girls with large breasts! This movie was shot in 2003, but it was shelved for five years. It was released straight to DVD in 2008.

3517949,3,B001CT876C,"It takes a good actor to play a bad one, and that's really the point of Return To Sleepaway Camp. Many critics have given this movie a terrible review, because they just don't understand it. Back in the 50's and 60's B-Movies were terrible because they had a very small budget. The actors were bad, the effects were ridiculous, and the story was rushed. Today's B-Movies have 100 times the budget of their predecessors. Return To Sleepaway has bad acting and terrible effects, not because they had no budget, but rather to pay homage to the B-Movies of the past. If you look at it in that context, this movie is actually pretty good! The kids are great, there are some really funny lines, and the cheesy effects are hilarious.

The acting an dialogue is pretty bad even for a B-movie.  I didn't dig it.  The kid getting bullied goes and picks fights with people.  When they start picking back at him, he starts whining that no one likes him.  It was so annoying.  I was actually hoping he would get killed.

Complete let down in that regard.  Secondly, the ""Alan"" character is so over the top and annoying that you begin to cheer for the bullies and hope that he dies soon. And when he doesn't the auidence is left very unfullfilled.  The other problem with this movie is that there is absoliutely no nudity in it.

This entry in the series is a bit of a letdown, even considering the novelty of using some of the original actors from the first installment.  Everything about this `sequel' is obnoxious.  It's loud; the characters/actors are all abrasive (there's no balance in that regard, what are the odds of everyone being thoroughly repellant?).  The pacing is slow.  The ""villain"" of this piece is obvious from the outset so trying to hide the identity was a wasted effort.  The ""kills"" were few and far between and what passed as filler in the meantime were endless scenes of cruelty/bullying (meant to be funny?).
The original concept worked, this trip down memory lane didn't.  It's even more apparent when you watch all the films in one sitting.  Not a keeper, not worth seeing again.",1318291200,2,860,4.809523809523809

This movie, is perfect. I Hadn't even heard of it before, and found it hiding behind some other movies, at the Video Store. It looked good, so i rented it... Best Decision i have evr made. It is such an entertaining movie. Every Second, It leaves you begging for more. At the Beggining of the movie, you think that our lead character, ""Allen"" Is the Bully, by the way he treat's the younger children in the cabin. The Camp counseler, comes in, and puts a stop to the harrasment to the children, by being very rude to allen. So then, we go through a couple minutes of the movie, seeing some children being rude to Him, and we start to wonder.. Is He the Bully, Is that why everyone hates Him? Or, Is everyone else the Bullies, and he is the Victim? We quickly realize the answer, when we go to the Kitchen Scene, when the guy throes eggs at him, and nothing is done. All thorugh the Movie, the Kid get's Harrassed, Tormented, and Bullied. We have everything from, Ataccking him with Paintball Gun's, Getting his Ball's Practically Sqeuazed Off, By an Overweight Girl, Beat with a club,..E.T.C Well, Mysterious Death's happen throughout the movie, and one of the Camp worker's Suspects that it is ""Angela"" From the First Movie, And no One Believes Him. One Scene, The Killer Dipps this guy Upside Down, in Boiling Grease! Each time, a death occurs, allen Get's the blame. EVERYONE, but 1, Suspects it's allen. So, his Step brother, finds him in the woods, and practically beats him too death, and then, The REAL Killer appears, and Skins the boy who is beating allen. (WE Dont see it happen, But realize it later. ) Well, at the end of the movie, the Mysterious Cop, who pretends to have throat cancer,takes off the Make-Up, and Clothes, and we realize that it really is Angela, from the 1st movie! The Movie, is too good for words. Best Sequel, i have ever seen to a movie. I Usually hate when people try to remake 80's Slashers, But i found a light. !0XX Better than the first.

3517957,2,B001CT876C,"<strong>Return to Sleepaway Camp</strong> (Robert Hiltzik, 2008)

Twenty-five years after the original <em>Sleepaway Camp</em> became a runaway cult hit, Robert Hiltzik got back in the director's chair for the fifth film in the ongoing (the sixth is in post-production as I write this; the fourth, started in 2002 and abandoned when the production company went bankrupt, is reported to now be finished and looking for a distributor) horror/comedy series. One would have hoped that Hiltzik returning to the fold would have meant a similar return to straighter horror, as the first movie wasn't played as a comedy, but one would hope in vain. Hiltzik has very much internalized the movies in between. The end result? A movie that combines the worst of all the pictures that came before it, with no inkling at all of what made them watchable.

Alan (Michael Gibney in his first big-screen appearance) is exactly the kind of kid an audience is least likely to feel sympathy for. He's a whiny little brat who complains to any adult in earshot that he's always getting picked on, which causes the older kids to pick on him, so he turns around and bullies those younger and smaller than himself. He also never bathes or changes his clothes (one of the few good touches in the movie is the degradation over time of the condition of his ever-present white T-shirt). Of course, he's the outcast, and you know where this is going if you've seen earlier movies in the series; those who pick on him start dying horrible deaths.

I think where Hiltzik went wrong with this is that in the original, which cleaves strongly to this same formula, while Angela wasn't exactly a sympathetic character, her extreme lack of socialization and uncomfortableness around others made us at least pity the poor kid. (Either that or Felissa Rose was really that bad an actress in 1983.) Alan is one of the least sympathetic characters in horror movies, maybe in any kind of movies, in a long, long time. I don't know about everyone else, but I was hoping he would be the first one to bite it less than five minutes in. It would be a spoiler to tell you the movie's biggest letdown, but given the placement of this sentence in this review, you're probably smart enough to figure out what it is on your own. A complete waste of time, notable only for Isaac Hayes' spoofing on the Chef character he played in <em>South Park</em> for a minute or so early in the film. * ",1310947200,3,2437,4.686915887850467
3517958,3,B001CT876C,"Known for having a shocking surprise ending, Sleepaway Camp (1983) is a classic 80's slasher, written and directed by Robert Hiltzik, that has gathered a huge cult following over the years.  Two ""unauthorized"" sequels followed in the 80's, which did not involve Hiltzik, or stars from the original film, Felissa Rose and Jonathan Tiersten.  With the support of fans still interested in seeing another sequel, Hiltzik resumes the story more than two decades later, in Return To Sleepaway Camp (2008) a direct to video release.

Hiltzik completely ignores the events in the previous two sequels, and resumes his story some twenty years after the infamous events at Camp Arawak, where transgendered Angela Baker (Felissa Rose) went nuts and committed a number of shocking murders.  At Camp Manabe, new owner and bird lover Frank Kostik (Vincent Pastore) has Ronnie Angelo (Paul DeAngelo), a former counselor at Arawak, on his staff.  Life at summer camp is much the same, with lots of fun activities, adolescent pranks, and hormones running wild.

Hiltzik attempts to replicate the vibe from the original movie.  This time the featured recipient of abuse is the camp troublemaker, Alan (Michael Gibney).  Frequently provoking fights, harassing girls, and throwing tantrums, he is picked on, and made the brunt of cruel jokes by almost everyone, as he tries to make friends with fellow camper Karen (Erin Broderick).

As before, the first kill is set in the kitchen, as a cook takes a fatal dive into a deep fryer.  The second kill is even more spectacular, where a stoner type kid is turned into a human torch.  The crimes bring Sherriff Jerry to the camp to investigate.  He speaks with a voice box because he lost his voice due to cancer, and it's pretty obvious that there are some other issues with the Sherriff.  Suspicion for the killings falls on Angela, but her cousin Ricky Thomas (Jonathan Tiersten), reports that she remains institutionalized.

After another tantrum, Alan runs off into the night, starting a night of bloody terror.  Kostik gets some unexpected headgear, while in the woods, Randy (Byre Cooper) a counselor, has a part of his anatomy yanked off, and his girlfriend Linda (Jackie Tohn) gets caught in a trip wire.  During the killing spree Ricky arrives at the camp, and joins Ronnie and Sherriff Jerry, in the search for Alan.

As in the original, the best parts of the film are the nasty kills, which are pretty creative, and display lots of variety.  Hiltzik still has a cool sense of style for shooting horror, and the level of gore and graphic violence, is cranked up to high this time.  Loyal fan support over the years is why this film was made, and Hilting delivers more of what the fans loved, keeping things at a very juvenile level, with lots of childish dialog.  In his acting debut, Michael Gibney is effectively obnoxious as Alan.  The late Isaac Hayes, has a brief role in the last film of his career.  The cast may not get to display much of their acting skills, but it hardly seems to matter, as long as the blood flows.  The big surprise reveal, probably isn't much of a shock by the time it occurs, as it is evident pretty early that Felissa Rose has returned.

Proving that fans can make a real difference, superfan Jeff Hayes was the force that helped get the major players together, and provide the impetus for the sequel to be made.  Hayes served as consulting producer for the film, and contributes some of the bonus materials.  Intended mainly for the fans, some who have been waiting over twenty years for a sequel, Return To Sleepaway Camp is a pretty solid effort.  The original film was crudely juvenile and charmingly unsophisticated, and the sequel retains some of that same flavor.  The film really steps up to modern levels in the violence and gore departments, delivering solidly.  After so much time had passed, Hiltzig probably didn't have many options for bringing back Angela, so it's fairly easy to go with the rather silly plotline.  It's time to go back to camp!",1304208000,8,4100,4.830945558739255
3517959,4,B001CT876C,"A lot of folks hate this movie.  Many horror fans and fans of the original Sleepaway Camp hate this movie.  I'm not trying to be a rebel or up the star rating average, but damn it, I actually liked this.
In this film, counselor Ronnie is still a counselor!  But at another camp where a kid named Alan is both a bully and a victim of bullying.  Folks around him start getting bumped off in Sleepaway Camp tradition, and the big question is: Is Alan responsible, or has Angela returned?
One of the biggest complaints here is the Alan character and how he is extremely unlikeable.  Well, reviewers are not wrong about this at all.  Alan makes your blood boil.  In fact, I am personally quite fascinated by why writer/director Hiltzik would make this guy the central character of the movie!  If Alan were endlessly tormented by his fellow campers, and endlessly whined about it, you'd find him annoying, but would have a little sympathy for him.  But Alan is a bully himself, picking on the smaller kids and being such a standoffish, childish jerk to every counselor and camper around him, that you simply can't feel anything but contempt for the guy.  In a way, I'd say that young actor(who's name escapes me at the moment) actually pulled off a good performance.
It almost seems as though Hiltzik was trying to make some kind of commentary about bullying and it's effects, a hot topic now.  But this is a Sleepaway Camp movie, we're not watching this stuff to psychologically sift through it.
In fact, everyone at this camp is extremely unlikeable.  Everybody's a jerk, everybody's mean, everybody has zero respect or feelings(except malice) towards everybody.  And the very few who aren't jerks are shown as small, nerdy wimps who get picked on by Alan.  Even most of the staff(except Ronnie) are vicious!  Who the hell would want to go to a summer camp like this??  Well, unfortunately the disrespectful portrayal of teenagers and preteens in this film is probably rather accurate in today's world.  It is great to see some of them massacred.
The kills, while not overly gory, are sometimes creative.  There is a castration scene which takes way too long to execute, and it's not very interesting.
So, I don't know what to tell ya.  I'm not gonna tell you to watch this film as a horror fan to a horror fan, as so many hated it.  But what can I say?  I liked it....much more than I probably should have.",1304208000,,2403,4.620283018867925
3517960,3,B001CT876C,"Be prepared to hear that line shouted a LOT in this movie, and you will have no problems figuring out what is going to happen next. I HAD to rate it at least 3 stars BECAUSE: The writing is good, it has the feel of the 80's stalker/killer movies it is emulating and I found it entertaining because the formula for writing this type of movie has been lost along the way somewhere and script writers need to take note of that. The killings were very inventive, and would have been MORE so if they could have afforded a second directing team to film the cutaways on at least 3 of the murders. It is GLARINGLY obvious they could NOT afford to do so, and relied too heavily on the massive predictable reveal that all movies of this type have where our heroine keeps running into dead bodies everywhere she goes. Our heroine in THIS movie seems VERY concerned with only saving her own ass, as it appeared to me that at least 3 of the mutilated people she screamed on by seemed to be ALIVE at the time. DON'T be caught in the woods alone with this bitch cuz she will leave skid marks on your back as she tramples away from the killer over the top of your face. By the way, if you cannot tell me who the killer is after watching the first 11 MINUTES of this movie, you need glasses. Yes, the disguise is THAT BAD. Um, if I wanted to hide the gender of someone who was female? I would FIRST give her a MAN WIG, or at LEAST cut her damn hair! Her hair bundled up under a hat like she stuffed a victorian hair style up under it??? REALLY??  I believe I would have saved enough money to buy her a man wig by replacing the bird with a fake one. It probably got more money to act than any of the other actors did. It WILL entertain just do not expect much.",1300665600,,1742,4.108504398826979

3517965,3,B001CT876C,"Robert Hiltzik returns to the director seat for the first time since his 1983 directorial debut `Sleepaway Camp'...and what better movie to make than a sequel to that film!  When it comes to the `Sleepaway Camp' series there seems to be 2 types of fans...Those who love the original film, but hate the sequels...and those who love the sequels, but hate the original.  As for myself, I tend to fall into the first category.  Now don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed `Unhappy Campers' and `Teenage Wasteland' that Michael A. Simpson brought us, however the original is far less campy and has one of the creepiest twist endings in cinematic history.  So when I first heard that Hiltzik was directing `Return to Sleepaway Camp' in 2003, I of course got quite excited about the possibilities, especially with the return of Felissa Rose as `Angela'.

Well the year 2003 came and went and the movie was never released...and then came 2004-2005-2006-2007...  I'm not exactly sure what was holding up the film's release date but it was to the point where I had given up hope that this film would ever come out.  But then out of nowhere there was the announcement... Magnolia Home Entertainment would be releasing `Return to Sleepaway Camp' on November 4th 2008!  Finally, fans would get to see the return of Angela for the first time in almost 20 years!

If you've seen the other `Sleepaway Camp' films, this movie is really no different.  Kid's goofing off at summer camp...kid's getting killed at summer camp.  The main story though revolves around an overweight bully by the name of Alan, who is constantly harassed and picked on by the ""cool kids"" at camp, even though one might argue that he's deserving of it.  It seems like with every person who picks on Alan, they end up getting knocked off in a rather gruesome fashion.  Like in the original movie you're left guessing who the killer is, which is part of the fun when it comes to watching any Slasher film really.

Upon its release in `08, the film got trashed by basically everyone.  In fact I held off on seeing it until now just because I hadn't heard one positive thing about the movie.  However, now that I've seen `Return to Sleepaway Camp' I have to say that I'm not exactly sure what everyone's issue is.  Sure it's easily the worst `Sleepaway Camp' film in the series, but to me it seemed to fit right in with the look and tone of the other films.  Yes it's campy as hell, with some hilariously bad acting, but isn't that the point?  No one goes into a 'Sleepaway Camp' film, expecting 'The Godfather' or at least I hope not...it's all about the low budget, cheese.

One of the only issues I really had with the movie is the absence of likable characters.  Alan (played by Michael Gibney) is so annoying in the film that it almost makes it impossible for the viewer to sympathize with him, even though you're supposed to at times.  In fact if he was the first one killed in the movie it would probably be cause for celebration really.  Despite him being annoying though, based on some of the outrageous things he says throughout the movie you can't help but to laugh and have a good time with it.

Other than that though, I think this film really has a lot going for it. Fans of the original 'Sleepaway Camp' will certainly be happy to see many returning faces, including Paul DeAngelo (Ronnie), Jonathan Tiersten (Ricky) and as mentioned before Felissa Rose as Angela.  'Return to Sleepaway Camp' also has some spectacular death sequences, especially for a film with such a low budget.  You'll see a guy's head get dipped in a deep fryer, a guy getting his penis ripped off as it's tied to the back of a moving Jeep, a kid getting a wooden stake pushed through his skull and all kind of other sickening things.  The movie also has great music and just an overall low budget 80's feel which I enjoyed.

I think if you're a fan of 'Sleepaway Camp' this film is definitely worth checking out.  If you're more into mainstream cinema this probably isn't for you.  Not a great movie, but it's no 'Haunted Boat', 'Werewolf In a Women's Prison' or the countless other b-movie garbage I've had to suffer through over the years.

3 out of 5 stars

Give it a chance.",1268006400,,4216,4.565159574468085
3517966,2,B001CT876C,"Let's face it - if you're checking out this film, then you're most likely a fan of the original (you may also be a fan of part's II and III, but really, those two films are a different beast when compared to the first film and this film). The original film gained notoriety because of it's innovative kills and its bizarre last act switcheroo that virtually no one saw coming. However, this film really only shares the original's attempts at somewhat creative kills and though it tries for a similar last act switcheroo, the switcheroo for this film only really works if you're incredibly gullible. Of course, the star of the original was Angela and that film tried hard (and succeeded) in making the audience care for her as she is portrayed as a shy, quiet, seemingly sweet girl who happens to get picked on for no particular reason other than the fact that she's shy, quiet and seemingly sweet. In this film we get obnoxious, overbearing Alan who is just as mean-spirited as the people he's constantly whining about. It's unclear if we're supposed to sympathize with Alan because, although for all intents and purposes, he seems to be our main character, he's incredibly unlikable and you sort of hope he's killed off rather quickly. Unfortunately, there's lots of scenes of Alan starting trouble and then reverting into some sort of twisted victim role that's possibly intended to emit some form of pathos, but doesn't. Alan is surrounded by a whole host of terrible actors who can't seem to die fast enough for my tastes. In fact, the killings don't really start until about an hour into the film. From there, we're pretty much subjected to an orgy of creative (and increasingly elaborate) kills ocurring to individuals who pretty much deserved it anyways. The film itself has the same feeling as the original, whether it was intended or not and harkens back to the golden age of classic slasher movies (actually, quite a nice change of pace from today's herky-jerky camera movement that contains 8,000 edits in one minute of film). Still, it's not enough to redeem this truly nasty bit of film that ultimately just makes you want to go back and watch the original. This film also contains multiple red herrings intended to divert you from guessing the identity of the killer, but none of them really work because you're too busy hoping everyone in the film will get bumped off real soon (for example, how stupid would you have to be to consistently check out a hole in the floor that you just saw a giant spear get poked through?) Honestly, the only character that elicits any bit of sympathy is the counselor Petey - she appears to be the only genuine human being in this film, but she disappears about halfway through and is only on-screen a handful of times. Vincent Pastore and the late Isaac Hayes are also in the cast and they both appear to be wondering what it is they're here for exactly (this movie seems to have a real problem introducing characters and then never seeing them again as Issac Hayes' character also disappears about 20 minutes or so into the film). In the end, I suppose it's worth it to watch if you're a fan of the previous entries, just don't expect a whole lot and be prepared to hate just about every character in the film. Otherwise, this is a pretty silly film that makes you scream more in frustration rather than in terror.",1265673600,,3364,4.65546218487395
3517967,4,B001CT876C,"As a huge fan of the original Sleepaway Camp, I waited over three years for this movie to be released while it was in post-production. The movie itself did not disappoint. It had the suspense of the original, the usual gags and comedy, and just enough camp (no pun intended) to keep it from being overly cheezy. I own all three previous movies, but did not really like the second and third installments due to the lack of suspense. I never liked the way it was turned in to a comedy-horror. I also did not like the fact that you knew who the killer was immediately, like the later Friday the 13th sequels. This movies goes back to the formula used in the original Sleepaway Camp movie, as well as the first five Fridays, the original Black Christmas, Happy Birthday to Me, and many others. It uses the ""camera as the killer"" technique where all you see are some hands, feet and the occasional silouette. I find this technique much more suspenseful and terrifying than knowing who the killer is all along. Without spoiling the ending for anyone, I will say that I understand why the killer had to be disguised throughout the movie. They even kept his/her name out of the credits until the end to protect his/her identity.

I'm giving this movie four stars, instead of five for two reasons: (1) Alan was annoying and worse than the other characters. If the killer only targets bad kids, he should have been the first to go. He goes around whining about the way he is being treated when he is the one acting like a spoiled brat when he doesn't get his way. I guess he had to survive so he would appear to be the killer. (2) This was one of the worst scores I have ever heard in a horror movie! I could not hear anything the characters were saying with all of the loud symbols banging and horns blowing. At first, I thought it was just mixed badly. I tried turning on the subtitles to read what they were saying in some scenes, but these were only available in Spanish in which I am not fluent. Finally, I had to keep rewinding the scenes to listen more closely. At this point, I've seen the movie so many times I know what they are saying, but this was really annoying for the first couple of viewings. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this in the other reviews, or at least the ones I've read.

The bottom line is Return to Sleepaway Camp is not quite as good as the original, but it is much better than the second and third installments. Whether you are a fan of the original or someone just discovering the films, you should not be disappointed. I only hope someone else will be hired to compose the music on the proposed ""Sleepaway Camp Reunion.""",1262390400,,2654,4.392276422764228

It followed the same story of Angela ,who use to be a man killing people at camp,but it was done in such a horrible way. I own all three slepaway camp movies,and I thought that this would be just as good or better,boy was I wrong. Please don't even waste your time or money on this movie!!!!",1259971200,,415,4.402597402597403
3517969,1,B001CT876C,"""Return to Sleepaway Camp"" is probably one of the very worst movies that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. As a huge fan of the classic slashers of the '80s, not to mention the original ""Sleepaway Camp"" trilogy I was extremely eager to watch this. It was a great idea and how could it go wrong?

There is so much wrong with this movie, I don't know where to start. First of all, you have to know that it's a super low-budget z-grade movie that was put out only on DVD. Some low-budget films are fine if you can't tell. But everything in this movie, from the lousy acting to the pathetic storyline is totally amateurish. How in the world did they get Vincent Pastore to sign on to this nonsense is completely beyond me. You can't tell me that this is the best movie script that he was given.

The lighting, the special effects, the sound and the acting were all equally abominable and abysmal. Everyone sounded like they had just memorized their lines and were trying not to forget them as they spit em out. I liked the one big mama, Bella. She fell into the so pathetic category because whomever the no-name that played her was just so awful. Although she was convincing as a fat chick.

The special features on the DVD are ridiculous. The cast pictures literally look some photos that someone took with one of those cheapo ""disposable"" cameras that CVS used to sell about 30 years ago. And the interviews were just laughable. Perhaps what I always enjoyed about the first ""Sleepaway Camp"" was the fact that the killer was always such a mystery; no one ever knew who he or she was until that final moment! But during the interviews, one of the cast members actually says who the killer is. That is just plain sloppy if you ask me. And the song included was just that, a song! No music-video, no nothing.

The reason why I chose to watch this was because I wanted to see how the story changed, picked up and went on from the prior movies. But there is absolutely no continuity. There is nothing. It's not even a remake though. It's just a horrible movie that went nowhere. I did like Isaac Hayes (may he rest in peace) but his character disappeared towards the beginning and it was never really explained what happened to him.

If you're like I was and have an interest in watching this movie I strongly advise that you save your money. You are not missing anything, trust me. I just wish I would have been told this before I watched this farce.",1252108800,2,2455,4.422566371681416
3517970,3,B001CT876C,"The movie was confusing. It starts off with kids lighting farts and then we are introduced to the main character, Alan. He tries to be a bully but everyone picks on him and I guess your suppose to feel sympathy for him. I hated him and wanted to beat him up. The first death is straight from the first film and I thought it was too damn long. Maybe they were doing it for suspense, but I was like hurry up already. There is one more kill and after that, the film just focuses on Alan being bullied. I hate to digress but they actually brought Ned from South Park as a real life chracter in this film. I have no idea what the hell his role was but he had a sheriff's uniform on. I watch this film and it drags on way to long without a kill as we watch Alan and what goes on with him. I looked at my dvd player and it said half an hour left so it should be picking up soon. There is plenty of kills towards the end but they all suck. One consular who loves birds had his head in a cage and an animal (which is never seen) does something to him, but only the aftermath is shown. Anther guy is tied to a tree, his lover returns and thinks the killer is after her. She drives off as his memeber is tied to the jeep's bumper. She is stuck in mud for like five minutes and finally puts the car in four wheel drive and it takes off but not in that way; This movie is really starting to suck. Alan is then beaten half to death by a camper and then Ned from South Park does some dialogue from the orignal film and it's Angela! Shocked? Well you shouldn't be since the box says it contains orignal cast members and you've watched an hour and twenty minutes go by without any sign of an orignal cast member. She skinned some camper alive and the end. What in the blue hell just happened? It ends like that? Bullcrap but wait!!!!! Scroll past the credits and here is the only good part of the entire film.

Overall, maybe im reading too much into the film and should enjoy it. I loved the first two films in the series and the third was decent. I never saw what was going to be the fourth one. This film focuses on a character that isn't worth watching and the deaths are plain dull, expect for after the credits. Angela is fun to watch but you only see her for maybe four minutes at the end.

3517971,4,B001CT876C,"If you'rewatching this movie then you've probably seen the Sleepaway Camp Trilogy of the 80's.  This movie is more a continuation/remake of the original Sleepaway camp.  Anyone with half a brain will figure out who the killer is within the first 5 minutes but that doesn't stop the film from being hilarious.

For those unfamliar with the trilogy and the storyline of the first film, it is more of a gory who-done-it type murder mystery with a twist.  This film seems to borrow heavily from that formula (no surprise, both films were written by the same guy) and pushes the story into a long sought after conclusion for fans.

Speaking of fans, I think most of them will find this latest sequel at least somewhat satisfying.  You can get a used copy here on Amazon for next to nothing, so even if you don't dig it you can always sell it to a friend and get your money back.

The Kills were nice and creative. The ending even though alot of people will pretend they easily figured it out they most likely didn't.

I like the way they brought back alot of the original cast from over 25 years. This is something I don't think I have ever seen before especially with a movie that started out in 1983 as a low budget slasher flick.

Because the deaths are so ""exotic"" and unusual, the horror is so unreal, that it becomes amusing. It is a blessed refief from the troubles of real life.

First Sleepaway Camp made a strong impression on me, I could easily relate to this shy, bullied little girl, and the end surprised me a lot.

I am really happy to be able to see these films again now, at my time of life.
These movies aren't shown in my country (France) and I was thrilled to find out there are sequels.

I haven't seen number 3 yet (can't wait!). I enjoyed n2, Angela is kind of nice, she means well, all she does is going too far!! She is good looking, the most horrifying is when she sings and plays the guitar!

My least favorite is Return to Sleepaway Camp : it is very difficult to sympathize with Alan, he is a fat slob, dirty, foul mouthed, he pesters the girls, bullies the little kids. His only endearing trait is that he is fond of his frogs.

All the other kids without exception are horrid too, cruel, vulgar, and when they die in all sorts of ""funny"" ways, you can't help saying to yourself, serves you right, you had it coming.

The dialogues also annoyed me to no end, the characters use this ""f...."" word 10 times in the same sentence. But maybe it is realistic? Anyway, it is very annoying and yo feel like slapping them to teach them some manners. They have absolutely no respect for one another or anybody else.

Angela's disguise is SO BAD that it must have been done on purpose, or else the film director and all his crew were drunk.

3517974,4,B001CT876C,".....you eat it anyways-the same can be said for Return To Sleepaway Camp, you know it's bad but savor each morsel as greedily as a Big Mac.

The story such as it is takes place 20 some-odd years after the massacre at the original camp, this new camp has the usual group of adults posing as obnoxious teens and going back to the food analogy, one of the ""teens"" an obese chubbette looks like she swallowed everything in a fast food restaurant and has the buns to match. One of the guys, also a chub but missing a few brain cells is the butt of everyones joke and when the slaughter begins he is the obvious suspect.

The director of the original Sleepaway Camp returns to direct this sequel but he fails to match the jaw-dropping final shot of the original, but how could he?  But not to worry the director shows his fondness for male genetalia and one death scene involves someone tied to a tree losing his.

The kill scenes are bloody and gruesome and one of the camp counselors, actually the same actor who played the same part in the original movie,and still as stupid as he was back then, starts suspecting the culprit is Angela the psycho from the first movie, who is the final shocking shot when Angela is revealed in all ""her"" glory.
The actress who played Angela is back but wearing a disguise so obviously fake, Stevie Wonder could've spotted it.

I had to rate this 4 stars because like junk food, it's not very nourishing, but it is tasty, even if you regret it later and the next time you are in a fast food restaurant and the clerk asks if you want fries with that burger, you will remember a scene in the movie involving french fries, a deep fryer, furiously boiling vegetable oil and.....never mind...watch the movie.

Overall the movie is fun, brainless, but fun and i found it a surprise but it is too bad the director couldn't top his originals ending but anyone familiar with the original will realize there is a slight nod and it still features Angela.",1241827200,,1973,4.4515235457063715
3517975,5,B001CT876C,"I've gotten into the habit recently of watching horror movie sequels back-to-back and then reviewing them.  I thought perhaps I was being anti-social, so I recently watched all four SLEEPAWAY CAMPS on four consecutive dates with the same girl.  See?  I'm not antisocial.  Just weird.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp/dp/6305841985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp</a>&nbsp;-- The original movie is bizarre, to say the least.  After a mild opening in which most of a family is killed with a speedboat, the movie cuts to two children, Ricky and Angela, being shipped off to Camp Arawak by Angela's mom, a ludicrously spacy woman.  Angela, the surviving daughter from the movie's intro, appears to be mute.  Ricky dutifully cares for her throughout the movie.  Aside from an old black cook and a well-meaning but clueless counselor named Ronnie, the rest of the cast is almost entirely composed of mean, selfish, antagonistic people.  But, phew!  They start getting killed.

The first person to kick the bucket at camp is a lecherous cook who openly brags about his pedophilia.  He's not kidding, either.  When he is introduced to Angela during lunch, in his busy kitchen, the first thing he does is drag her into a supply closet with the intention of exposing himself (and probably more).  Later, he has a large tureen of boiling water dumped onto his head.  Zing!

The movie tries to make itself mysterious, but it's not hard to figure out who's doing the killing.  Every time Angela is picked on in some way, the person eventually bites it in some overly dramatic and silly deaths.  However, although the whodunit of it is not a big surprise, there's still a lot of mystery to the movie.  Specifically, my date and I wondered how it ever got made.  The budget appears to have been twenty dollars, and -- up to that point -- both of us claimed to never have seen such horrific acting.  It was a stupid, poorly contrived, horribly done film, and the writer/director, Robert Hiltzick, had dedicated the entire thing to his late mother, a woman the dedication describes as ""a doer.""

We couldn't stop laughing.  I don't think the film was meant to be so funny.  Maybe it was.  Maybe that's where the phrase ""campy"" came from.  Either way, we enjoyed ourselves.  Four (accidental?) stars.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp-II-Unhappy-Campers/dp/B00006ADDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp II - Unhappy Campers</a>&nbsp;-- The very first thing that happens in this film: Angela (same character, different actress), is now a counselor at Camp Rolling Hills.  Within the first two minutes of the film, she bludgeons a female camper and then cuts out her tongue, punishment for sneaking over to the boy's camp and telling scary bonfire stories.  Angela, apparently, is like a camp chastity Nazi or something.  My date is disgusted and already regretting her decision.

It's obvious right away that this film is not only far more graphic and explicit (when the girls aren't topless and joking about their breasts, they are trying to get slutty with each other's boyfriends), but it is also not interested at all in suspense or drama.  Angela kills every single person without even a ""how do you do?""  That might sound like a spoiler, but this movie doesn't have any secrets or tricks up its sleeve.  A camp of sinners and sleazeballs gets sliced and diced.  The end.

There is a subplot concerning the two wholesomest kids in camp finding each other amidst all the devious tramps and the people being stabbed and drowned in outhouses, but these kids were apparently only halfsome, because, as I pointed out, they die along with everyone else.  But I guarantee you, I didn't ruin the movie for you.  No.  This movie is just another dumb, horribly written and directed film that is actually pretty funny.  Just as funny as the first one, though.

My date refused to finish it after the outhouse scene.  Four stars.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp-III-Teenage-Wasteland/dp/B00006ADDF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp III - Teenage Wasteland</a>&nbsp;-- In the first two minutes of this film, the viewer is treated to more pointless nudity and a death by garbage truck (driven by Angela).  She is now on her way to Camp New Horizons, an ill-advised social experiment that forces juvenile delinquents and spoiled rich kids into tents together.  This place is run by a dangerously idiotic couple and seems to have little to no funding.  The only person with any degree of dignity is the camp's only counselor (!) a guy named Barney who is also an officer of the law AND the father of a camper who died in the previous film.

The dialogue and acting in this film make the first two look like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>.  The characters make wild, irrational decisions.  People are despicable for no good reason, and Angela never struggles with finding the time, energy, and secrecy to dispatch of most of them.  She is aided by the fact that this camp, like the previous two, seems to have no schedule of events or basic supervision.  In fact, budget constraints must be lower than ever, because this time around the place appears to be run out of two woodsheds.  And yet, in the credits, there is this: Mr. Simpson's Porsche Provided by MEGDAL IMPORTS.  Mr. Simpsons is the director, and to the best of my knowledge, neither he nor his Porsche appear in the film.  Another horrible horror movie that we couldn't stop laughing at.

My date said that the acting was even worse than the first film.  She gave it two thumb up.  Me: Four stars.

NOTE: THERE IS APPARENTLY A FOURTH FILM SOMEWHERE OUT THERE.  I COULD NOT FIND IT, NOR KNOW ANYONE WHO IS WILLING TO VOUCH FOR ITS EXISTENCE.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Sleepaway-Camp/dp/B001CT876C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Sleepaway Camp</a>&nbsp;-- The creator, Hiltzik, was not responsible for parts 2 or 3.  They were the work of writer Fritz Gordon and director Michael Simpson.  For some wild reason, Hiltzik, who'd done NOTHING since the first film (according to iMDB), decided to make a REAL sequel to his first film.  This is it, a movie so absolutely awful in every way, I found it nothing short of mesmerizing and have watched it twice again since.

It's obvious that Hiltzik is catering to his fans, because the first death is almost identical to the first death in the first film: rude cook dies by hot liquid.  The head cook is, yet again, an elderly black man (Isaac Hayes who acts in every scene as if he has recently gone blind).  Muscley, dim-witted Ronnie is back as the head counselor.  Reprising his role from the original, Paul DeAngelo makes bad acting look like a fine art.  I'm not joking.  I could watch that guy overact for hours and hours.

The camp is run by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sopranos/dp/B001C3O6R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sopranos</a>'s Vincent Pastore, and is once again filled with the most mean-spirited, vile children ever.  The kids are so rude and unruly, when they are punished for their misbehavior (by being sent to their cabins), I'm surprised they don't just hit the counselor with a rock.  The hammy acting will astound you.  The dialogue will baffle and delight.  Even the extras in this film are as weird and wooden as life-sized cardboard puppets.

The plot this time around is not very different at all.  One camper, a kid named Alan, is the butt of everyone's jokes, and those who taunt and tease him end up meeting grisly ends.  The thing is, Alan is the whiniest and most annoying movie character since Luke Skywalker.  Played with absolutely no consistency at all by Michael Gibney, Alan is the movie's most confusing character.  Does this boy have a mental disorder?  Is he schizophrenic?  Why does he love frogs so much?  Why doesn't he ever, ever, ever change his clothes?  Why is he such a jerk?

Yes.  Alan is just as annoying and mean as everyone else, and yet when the camp gangs up on him and shoots spit balls at him or yells at him to stop making flamethrowers out of lighters and spray cans, he starts complaining that everyone is picking on him because ""he's different.""  He chats with his brother about a mysterious ""fever.""  ""The doctor said there'd always be effects,"" Alan moans as he pets a frog.

It makes no sense.  Nor does the rest of the film.  The original actors who portrayed Ricky (Jonahan Tiersten) and Angela (Felissa Rose) reprise their roles here, which is a bit of a treat.  Tiersten has obviously done no acting since the first film.  He doesn't even bother looking interested, casually smoking a cigarette during a tense hunt in the woods for the bodies of slain children.  Rose isn't exactly recognizable for much of the film, but it won't be hard to know point her out after about ten minutes.  My date did it in twelve.

My date hated the film.  So did my neighbor, who refused to watch anymore after about thirty minutes.  But me?  I couldn't get enough.  It is, without question, the most hilariously awful film I've seen since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/B000OVLBHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>.  I chuckle now just thinking about it.

I see that Hiltzik has started production on a SLEEPAWAY CAMP REUNION.  Bravo, Mr. Hiltzik.  I doubt very much that you'll be able to top the inane silliness, the incomprehensibly horrible acting, the deliciously cheesy plot ""twists,"" but I'll be glad to watch you try.

First off, I feel this film is aimed almost directly to fans of the cult classic original film. With that being said, perhaps folks of decent budgeted horror flicks, and not around during the schlocky 1980's horror craze might not enjoy it.
But as a fan of the original, I loved this. Campy, gory fun. Actor, Christopher Shand is gorgeous, and a decent young talent. And the ending? Well, I loved it! It was also great to see Felissa Rose again. Note: this is a direct sequal to the original 1983 film, as part 2 and 3 are not ""officially"" part of the series(I liked those parts as well).

Return to Sleepaway Camp disappoints in regards to the quality of acting, plot and a very poorly conceived finale with a very brief cameo appearance by the killer, Angela. To put it bluntly, the writers made a very low budget film and it showed considerably. Though some of the original cast from the first movie was brought back in, it wasn't enough to bring great reviews to the actors reading from a terrible script.",1233532800,2,537,4.546391752577319
3517983,2,B001CT876C,"Writer/Director Robert Hiltzik returns to the series to direct the 4th installment (unless you wanna count The Survivor the un-completed film as the 4th than this would be the 5th). Regardless of what part you consider this Return to Sleepaway Camp ignores the sequels and picks up from the original. Originally shot back in 2003 Return to Sleepaway Camp has had delay after delay on the release date. This movie was dubbed the Chinese Democracy of film, since like the Guns N' Roses album fans waited and waited only to see each release date come and pass. Where as the Guns N' Roses album was worth the wait Return to Sleepaway Camp clearly wasn't.

Lets be serious here; the original Sleepaway Camp was by no means a good movie. The main reason for the cult status is the overall weirdness of the movie and of course the twisted shocker of an ending that remains shocking to this day. But the original was a fun movie in how bad it was. Despite the reputation Sleepaway Camp is very much a so bad its good movie and it was a blast to watch. The sequels played up to that and everything in those movies was intentional unlike the original.

The one thing that is clear is Robert Hiltzik hasn't learned anything about filmmaking in the past two decades so I'm not really shocked Sleepaway Camp was his only film until Return to Sleepaway Camp. I'm not putting the original down, but it really wasn't a very well done movie, but has this charm about it only found in the 80s and Sleepaway Camp has been a film I've loved since I saw it as a kid. Return to Sleepaway Camp is one hell of a messy film that is so badly made one has to be amazed a company was willing to distribute this.

The screenplay by Robert Hiltzik is extremely poor; the characters have the dumbest things to say. Ok so I get the movie deals with teenagers, but the dialogue is more fitting for pre-teens. The script had no structure to it and no real ideas either. But the script is so poorly written that one cannot help but laugh at the idiotic things being said. This easily rates as one of the worst screenplays, but with that said so very fun. The script is one of those that are so poor it almost makes it good. I was amazed at some of the dialogue in this film it really was so bad, but again it was sort of fun due to that.

As director Robert Hiltzik doesn't fair much better; while the original was a sloppy movie at times it worked well for whatever reason and even had a couple of semi suspenseful scenes. But not here; there is absolutely zero suspense and tension and Robert Hiltzik clearly has no vision for the movie. Each scene is more idiotic than the last one, but what Robert Hiltzik manages to do is craft scenes that are so amazingly bad the viewer is bound to have a lot of fun watching it. Apparently Robert Hiltzik hated the sequels directed by Michael A. Simpson, but Michael A. Simpson made Sleepaway Camp 2 & 3 to be a certain way. Both those movies came out to be the type of so bad its good movies, he played up to the clichs of the slasher movie and delivered two of the most fun movies I have ever seen; Hiltzik should have paid more attention to what Simpson did.

There's no story and no sense of pacing with zero suspense and no scares at all. Despite the flaws with the original you can find some of these elements in there. Maybe Robert Hiltzik just got lucky with a few scenes I don't know. But even with the original it was clear Hiltzik wouldn't go down as one of the genre greats, but his directing in Sleepaway Camp seems like Dario Argento when compared to Return to Sleepaway Camp.

As for who the killer is you should know from their very first appearance; if you cannot tell who it is well I hope you have problems with your sight. All I'll say is worst disguise ever! I really hope that was intentional on the part of Robert Hiltzik because he wasn't fooling anybody so I can only assume we the viewer was meant to know right off the bat. If not well there isn't much I can say; but I refuse to believe it was meant to be a mystery.

Amazingly enough it took 2 cinematographers to shoot this movie; Ken Kelsch & Brian Pryzpek are the men responsible for that and these guys are totally clueless. Lighting a scene is very important though your average moviegoer probably won't realize how important that is. The lighting in Return to Sleepaway Camp is horrible and add that with Hiltzik's direction any possible suspense is pretty much dead.

The movie features some of the most obnoxious characters to ever grace cinema; the original also was like that so I assume that was the plan by Robert Hiltzik, but these characters were just annoying and there really wasn't anyone likeable at all and that does hurt the film. At least in the original Angela was likeable and more importantly sympathetic. But here you'll find no character like that and it does hurt the film when you have no character you can root for. And while on the characters the acting was poor, but since most of the actors are early in their careers I'll cut them some slack and even an actor like Leonardo DiCaprio couldn't sound good saying the lines in this movie.

I suppose the only likeable character would be Ronnie again played by Paul DeAngelo; and also that is actually the one really cool thing about the movie was having Paul DeAngelo as well as Jonathan Tiesten and Felissa Rose from the original. While Jonathan Tiesten doesn't add much to the movie it was still cool to see him back.

Alan played by Michael Gibney is without a doubt the single most annoying character to ever appear in the film. While I have seen actors that are worse, but never as annoying; obviously Michael Gibney doesn't have any Oscars in his future, but it wasn't a case of bad acting. Every second this guy appears on screen I wanted to strangle him. My God he was so annoying. No doubt the most annoying actor I have ever seen. His dialogue is the absolute worst and again Michael Gibney is just so damn annoying. I seriously wanted to strangle the guy every second he was on screen.

For the life of me I cannot grasp how Robert Hiltzik managed to get both Vincent Pastore and Isaac Hayes in this movie; both actors are pretty good, but why did they sign on? Either Hiltzik is a very good business man or he had some kind of pictures on them. Pastore and Hayes are both fairly good actors, but you'd never know that based on their performances here; midway through Isaac Hayes goes MIA maybe he realized how horrible this movie was and got the hell out of dodge.

Ok so I've pretty much trashed this movie and yes it deserves the trashing every bit. But even with all this badness, Return to Sleepaway Camp is sort of fun. I'll admit I was laughing through the whole movie. Return to Sleepaway Camp is so horrible that it makes the movie a lot of fun to watch. I had a fun time watching Return to Sleepaway Camp; there are just so many things to make fun and as horrible as this movie is I'll admit there was fun to be had. I can honestly say that I was never bored during the movie. Each scene is just so idiotic and silly and poorly made that it does make the movie a bit fun to watch. But make no mistake Return to Sleepaway Camp is an epic failure from a filmmaking side of things, but again the badness does add to the fun level.

For those who can watch terrible movies like this and have fun I slightly recommend this. The rest stay away.",1232496000,4,7423,4.3586406362979035
3517984,3,B001CT876C,"Cheesey 80's slasher makes a good come back with the fourth in this series. If you haven't seen the other three than watch those first. It would be like watching the fourth Friday The 13th first. It doesn't make a lot of sense does it? Return To Sleepaway Camp is by no means a groundbreaking film. It is directed by Robert Hiltzik, which we all know and love him from the first Sleepaway Camp. Also starring in this is a few of the original characters from the first film. Going into this, I had high expectations. I can't say I was blown away, but not that disappointed either. It had exactly all of the components I was looking for. The bad acting, good torture scenes, well directed, it had the 80's feel, the creepiness, and a pretty good twist ending that I knew from the beginning. Except I was surprised to see who it was. I really do miss the awfulness of 80's horror. And that's why I liked this movie as much as I did. I can't give it over 3 stars solely for the fact that it is not as good as the other Sleepaway camps, especially the first one.

 Summer begins at Camp Manabe, where the kids are out of control and mean just for the laughs. The staff is of course is in no help to any of the children, most of the time just as divious towards the campers. Rewind to two decades ago when the kids and staff started popping up mutilated. Just as before the torture begins and noone is safe. Their only survival is to capture the villian that is slaughtering the campers and staff. But who can they trust as everyone becomes a suspect? Who will survive and who will become the next victim of Camp Arawak, I mean Manabe?

 Return To Sleepaway Camp is a highly entertaining watch. This type of film is not one to be taken seriously. Try to judge it as you judged a lot of the 80's cinema, cheesey, funny, ridiculous, outlandishly bad acting and most important, totally awesome LOL!

I wish I were joking, but this was one of those movies where it was just excruciating to watch through to the end. If you really must watch this movie I highly recommend taking some form of pain killer before pressing play, you'll thank me later.

A few other thoughts...
- None of the characters were likable on any level.
- The whole plot, if you can call it that, was ill-conceived at best.
- This just seems like a poor attempt to cash-in on the Sleepaway Camp name and make a few bucks from the fans with fond memories of the originals.

Issac Hayes in one of his final roles co-stars as a Chef whom is a homage to his ""South Park"" character, this one won't disappoint fans of the series including the cult original as it offers sexy girls, gory violence like the memorable gasoline with drugs death sequence that has to be seen to believed, decent acting, and of course a suprise ending just like the original as this is the best sequel of the franchise. Hell even the original's writer/director/producer Robert Hiltzik has returned.

This DVD offers a few good extras like Behind The Scenes featurette, interviews, Photo Gallery and music video.",1227657600,5,1794,4.765273311897106

3517993,4,B001CT876C,"This movie is misunderstood and under appreciated! I took a chance tonight after reading the negative reviews, and rented it from the Redbox. I was VERY pleasantly surprised by this! It's a terrific tongue-in-cheek sequel to the original! It was great to see so much of the original cast come back, along with the original director. Matter of fact, I've decided to purchase this movie now, and set it next to my Sleepaway Camp Survival Kit. People who say that this ""wasn't as good as the others"" are clearly confused....do you remember how intentionally cheesy they were, too? Audiences nowadays want films to be more sophisticated and refined than the cheese of the 80's, but it's entertainment like this that I really, deeply miss. Welcome back, Sleepaway Camp!",1227312000,2,764,4.9765625
3517994,4,B001CT876C,"I was thrilled to hear they were making Return To Sleepaway Camp partly because some of the essential original cast are reprising their roles ,such as Jonathan Tierston as Ricky ,Paul DeAngelo as Ronnie and Felissa Rose as Angela.

The original is a favorite retro slasher of mine. Like I stated please don't waste your time on the other so called sequels because this is really the only one that is worthy and takes you straight from point A to point B..The new characters are a bunch of wacky annoying kids that you delight in seeing getting bumped off in very clever ways. There is your Fat boy who gets picked on much like Angela was picked on but this dude really deserves it. He runs around annoying everyone and his ultimate insult is that he tells everyone their A** stinks,We also have the ever so popular lighting of farts by campers and that raises this movie a good half star in my book and I'm a girl,You gotta love the small pleasures in life and then we have the fat black chick who rules the roost with a loud mouth and bad attitude.

She's fun to watch and fun to see get nailed so to speak.
I found this movie to have a nostalgic feel to it that reminded me of the first one,even the sets were done really well. Plus I Love Jonathan Tierston who now is also a successful musician with his band Jonathan Tierston and Ten Tiers. The gore is up to par and the deaths are quite original not just a whack and a hack here and there,I really enjoyed it and will watch it a few times.",1226707200,,1494,4.275618374558304

K I am a HUGE Sleepaway Camp fan, I have the red cross box set which was pulled from shelves because they got sued for using the Red Cross logo without permission. Anyways I had little expectations with this movie, I LOVED seeing alot of the original Sleepaway Camp cast come back together after so long! I loved Sleepaway 2 & 3 with Pamela Springsteen however think of this Sleepaway Camp as a follow up to the original disreguard 2 & 3. Felissa Rose actually is back!!!! I thought it was the fat kid killing people for a while but ANGELA BAKER is back! Disguised and revealed at the end! I ALMOST DIED!! This movie has been SO LONG in the making, I actually gave up on it a year ago thinking it would never be released, kinda like I am now with the horror movie ""ON HOLD CURRENTLY"" called TRICK R'TREAT. Anyways If your a fan of Sleepaway Cmap you gotta check this out!!!!FRIGGIN AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1226620800,2,985,4.794117647058823
3517996,5,B001CT876C,"This movie is a perfect sequel in the series. i loved the first 3! and this one fits very well in the series! this movie had great deaths,scenes,and story! i loved it!",1226534400,3,167,4.25
3517997,5,B001CT876C,"First off i am a huge sleepaway camp fan, i love all 3 movies and can watch them all over and over again. When i heard that they were making another one i was more then thrilled. But i started to get impatient when the kept pushing it back further and farther, i was starting to think that it wasn't going to be released but it finally came out and i bought it that same day.

I loved the film but i do have a few problems with it. When i first watched it i wasn't really sure what to think, a part of me loved it and the other part was a bit disapointed. 1) Low body count, i was expecting a bit more but the first sleepaway camp wasn't to big in the body count area so i guess its not that bad. I did enjoy the creativity they put into the death scenes. The bunk bed one was nice 2) The character of alan was a little to over the top for me, was kinda getting annoying. They picked on him so much it was unbelievable. 3) The end...just watch it and you'll see. Your going to either love it or hate it but myself, i want to see what happens after that!!!

So despite the little problems it had i did enjoy the film. It really did feel like a sleepaway camp movie right out of the 80s. It was directed fairly well but i thought it could have been written a bit better. It was good to see most of the original cast return, and to see issac hayes(even though he was barely in it). I had a lot of fun watching it and if you don't take it too seriously and realize your watching a direct to dvd sequal to a slasher movie that was made 25 years ago then you should to.
So if you enjoyed the first sleepaway camp, then you'll want to see get this movie. So now i just have to sit and patiently wait for sleepaway camp reunion, lets just hope it gets made!!!",1226448000,8,1751,3.9295774647887325
3517998,1,B001CT876C,this movie is such a disappointment. i was expecting something good. this film isn't even in the same league as the first 3 movies. the ending was just awful as well. i'm warning you don't waste your money on this movie. i spent $20 on it and now i'm stuck with a crappy dvd i will never watch again. its terrible. its also sad i stayed so excited for this movie over the past 5 years.,1226448000,,385,4.078947368421052
3517999,5,B001CT876C,"just like the original, this long awaited sequel has its own vibe and style. campy humor, vicious characters, and gruesome murders set it apart from all the crappy theatrical releases that dissapointed us for the last couple years. this should have went to theaters.",1226448000,2,266,5.068181818181818
3518000,1,B001CT876C,"This movie seems like an intentional comedy with some murders thrown in.
There were no scares, no thrills, no tension, nothing except a series of brutal murders which are sickening to watch.
The comedy aspect  does not work at all. The acting is beyond terrible (except wait, is that Isaac Hayes as the Chef?)
There is constant high pitched screeching from the kid who is being picked on, which is so annoying I almost turned it off.
This seems like a teenage boys horror movie dream, And I can't see anyone beyond that enjoying it. (and I usually love horror films)  The ending literally made me say ""whatever"". I rented this for $1 at McDonald's thankfully.",1226102400,2,659,4.672413793103448
3518001,3,B001CT876C,"In spite of all the rhetoric and excitement generated by various articles in horror-movie rags, and despite the fact that this is the first sequel to SLEEPAWAY CAMP (1983) that was helmed by the director of the original, this flick is not nearly as exciting nor as fun as one might expect.  Among the problems with RETURN TO SLEEPWAY CAMP that make it a lesser film than the original are:

1. The campers that get offed are merely irritating whiners, not nasty reprobates like the victims in the first film

2. It is way too easy to figure out who the killer is and where Angela is hiding

3. Most of the kills are predicable and unoriginal

4. The talents of the really good actors in this film, such as Isaac Hayes (yes, THAT Isaac Hayes, here in one of his final movie appearances) and Erin Broderick (better known as Maureen Stabler, daughter of Detective Elliot Stabler, on TV's LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT), are wasted in minor roles

That's not to say that RETURN TO SLEEPWAY CAMP isn't without its pleasures.  After all these years, it is definitely fun to see Felissa Rose reprise her role as Angela Baker.  And there are a few pretty faces (though no real T&A shots) and a little bit of over-the-top gore (though not as much as might be expected for a slasher film). Overall, however, the film is a let-down for fans that love the bizarre first SLEEPAWAY CAMP, especially after all the hype about this film that was generated prior to its release.

The DVD from Magnolia Home Entertainment presents the film in anamorphic widescreen, and the transfer is crisp and clear (there are, however, a few minor filmic artifacts visible here and there).  Also, the disc includes lots of bonus features, including a making-of documentary and cast interviews.  A pretty nice package for what is ultimately a mediocre film.",1226102400,3,1827,4.678125
3518002,2,B001CT876C,"I really don't exect a real lot from horror movies anymore after seeing some real dooseys this wasn't as bad as some of the movies I have seen where you sit there and think to yourself I can't believe I am wasting my time watching this or I can't believe someone actually made this crap, but you certainly won't be saying this is the best movie ever!
The characters are annoying and almost over the top in unbelievability, the acting was strange, and the story (was there one) was very transparent.  This movie was made entirely for the fans of the first one, if you loved the first one, this will satisfy some kind of need in you.  But if you thought it was just ok you will be disappointed, you may even be disappointed if you are a fan like I was.",1226102400,,750,4.2377622377622375
3518003,4,B001CT876C,"After reading a few venomous reviews for Return to Sleepaway Camp on the various online horror sites, I was expecting the worst. Well, I was pleasantly surprised... the latest Sleepaway Camp movie delivers the thrill, gore, fun and campy humor we've come to love from the franchise. Clever murders, (mostly) solid actors and best of all, the return of Ricky from the first movie.

It's not perfect by any means, there's not nearly enough Felissa Rose in it, the bullying scenes start to drag, but still captures the 80s stylings of the earlier movies to good effect.

Here's hoping there's another!",1225929600,4,598,4.910891089108911
8289150,3,B001CT876C,"I was a fan of the original Sleep Away Camp movie, so I decided to pick this up and see if it was any good.  As far as slasher movies go it's okay.  The acting is pretty lame, the special effects are okay, the casting isn't bad, and the fact that they got the original actress to revise her role as Angela Baker was pretty cool.

It's nothing amazing but it's entertaining and makes some good references to the original film.  Check it out!",1525392000,,440,4.2023809523809526
8289151,5,B001CT876C,"A true nod to the original.  I loved part 2 and 3 (we won't discuss part 4... let's just pretend it never happened) for different reasons from the original (which I loved too).  This was fun, loads of fun.  Warped, yes, but fun.  I'd highly recommend this one.",1515628800,,260,4.354166666666667
8289152,2,B001CT876C,"This one almost became my favorite of the series, it was made in 2008, and actually had a few familiar faces in it. I thought maybe they'd been fans of the previous films and this was going to be something more decent than it ended up being. The kill scenes where looking strong and getting more creative, they where getting to be really enjoyable... and I even knew right from the moment I saw a character who it really was, but was just waiting for the reveal.... and then the reveal happened.... and it mimicked the god awful non-resolving unsatisfying end of the original, and dropped a star.

It also dropped another star for a particular annoying actor who needed to be offed earlier in the film instead of slowly becoming the killer inspiration to kill more. What could have been the best film in the series had two major flaws that I couldn't see past and it ruined the entire movie from there.",1509840000,,902,4.5
8289153,4,B001CT876C,"I honestly really enjoyed this film. Is it perfect? No. But neither are any of the Sleepaway Camp films. I'm a big fan of the original, and parts II and II were a lot of fun. (Like many others, I've thus far ignored that mess they call ""Sleepaway Camp IV."") Unlike II and III, however, this film was written and directed by the helmer of the first film, Robert Hiltzik, and it really shows. Twenty years of inactivity in the film industry somehow left the man's idiosyncratic writing and directing style completely unchanged. He even ""got the band back together,"" so to speak, and brought in some of the actors from the original film.

In this film, camper Alan is very viciously bullied, probably because he is perhaps the most repulsive human who was ever born. Then various campers and counselors complicit in his bullying start getting brutally murdered. In true Sleepaway Camp fashion, they are murdered via odd and impracticable contrivances designed only to maximize gore, pain, and humiliation. In a decidedly unsurprising twist, the killer turns out to be Sleepaway Camp's very own Angela, in a thoroughly unconvincing disguise.

I recommend this film if you're a fan of the original and you yearn for a nostalgic return to the bizarre cinematic landscape of the original cult classic. Just don't go expecting a masterpiece or a twist that lives up to that of the original. Like I said. it's not perfect. It may not even be ""good,"" but it's definitely Sleepaway Camp.",1501200000,,1476,4.830039525691699
8289154,1,B001CT876C,"I was one of the few people who actually saw Sleepaway Camp in a theater.  It played on a double feature with Evil Dead when both were completely unknown films.  It goes without saying that Evil Dead was the far better half of that double feature.  Sleepaway Camp didn't really impress me much and I was a big fan of slasher films but one thing you could say about that film even though it wasn't good is that it was genuinely odd.  Sleepaway Camp was strange--the characters, dialogue, and acting all just felt a little bizarre and off compared to any other slasher movie.  Watching it again many years later the movie seemed to work no better as a horror film but it was still a genuinely odd and quirky piece of work that had its own unique personality, even if there wasn't anything beyond that to really recommend it.

Return to Sleepaway Camp makes the original film look like Halloween.  It's an absolutely atrocious film but not in an interesting way--it feels like the filmmakers were trying to make an intentionally bad film because they thought it would be funny to make an intentionally bad film but movies that try to be bad funny on purpose don't work--they lack the sincerity of something like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Sleepaway Camp or Miami Connection or The Room where the filmmakers were obviously trying to make good movies and the strangeness and ultimate entertainment value of each film was achieved both honestly and accidentally.

It never feels like the people behind Return to Sleepaway Camp are making any attempt at all to create a good film.  The acting is obnoxious and way too broad.  The movie frequently feels more like a lazy and laughless comedy with occasional murders than a horror film.  There couldn't possibly be less suspense.  There's pretty much nothing about Return to Sleepaway Camp that works--it's a completely dreadful movie and the fact that it's almost certainly bad on purpose doesn't make it any more entertaining.",1499904000,,1972,4.767647058823529
