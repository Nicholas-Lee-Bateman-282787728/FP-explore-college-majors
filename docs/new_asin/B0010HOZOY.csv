3048917,5,B0010HOZOY,"For 100 million years, bees have provided sustainability on earthyet these glorious pollinators are fading from our planet. The folks behind BEE PEOPLE have come up with an incredible hybrid film that presents an experience both educational (you will learn a ton about bees and their caretakers) as well as entertaining (the characters you meet could make a phenomenal TV show with their telling of stories, especially the Bee Guru!). According to Film Threat, Bee People is ...an entertaining and informative glimpse into the life of a unique subculture of humanity."". I could not agree more.

Shot entirely on location in places as diverse as Colorado to New York and New Jersey. It explores beekeeping in rural areas as well as urban environments. The footage with Tony Bees (a NYC cop beekeeper extraordinaire) is as incredible as it is fun, and since making the film, Tony has gone national with interviews in such magazines as People.

Importantly, BEE PEOPLE is the first film in this genre to offer a solution. No spoilers here, but if you watch this film, you could easily become part of that solution!

Featured in the film are:

Gregg McMahan aka The Bee Guru
NYPD Detective Tony Bees Planakis
William Schlenkler aka Billy Bee
Mike Gallagher aka The Bee Medic
Leslie Ellis aka The Bee Angel (who also is one of the key members of the production team)
And many more...

Ultimately, BEE PEOPLE should come with a little warning. ""Watching this film may result in hives"". And that is precisely the goal of BEE PEOPLE.",1405296000,4,1525,4.85
3048928,4,B0010HOZOY,Very informative as well as entertaining to watch. I am a bee supporter and pray more people are educated about the damage that is done when humans are destroying the environment.,1466985600,,179,4.806451612903226

3048931,5,B0010HOZOY,"Just saw this DVD and thought it was marvelous! Very interesting information given as you follow Gregg, et al around as they relocate and rescue bee swarms from various barns and other locations. Nice mix of good information with humor and seeing how these guys are committed to education and trying to make the case for the vanishing bee population which if effecting us all.

3048932,1,B0010HOZOY,"After a few minutes I regretted my purchase.  After 30 min. I have had more than enough.  This is like a romp through the neighborhood with a couple of good ol' boys.  Really?  Yikes.  I watched ""Vanishing of the Bees"" and ""Queen of the Sun"" and felt educated, inspired, and grateful for the heart-centered, mindful story of our bees.  This is a different experience.",1443398400,3,367,4.65625
3048933,2,B0010HOZOY,"No joke. This is a GMO-type of movie for city folks who have no idea what bees do or even read ""Beekeeping for Dummies.""

Those who educate children in schools about bees are exhibited in this ""movie."" Yet NOTHING in this movie was educational, but a ""ride along"" with city beekeepers who think that they are ""tough"" guys and gals. $7,000 equipments, nice trucks, ""harley"" t-shirts, gold chains and rough handling of bees. Don't get me wrong - they are beekeepers, I guess, too. But I'm not used to this type of beekeeping approaches. Seen this type before, but have never been impressed by them...

My observations of beekeeping in Africa, Eurasia and America's by native beekeepers solidified my simple and natural approach to beekeeping that does not require 1,000's of $ worth of equipment, but common sense and LOVE for bees.

The scenes of old man taking care of his ""girls"" were heart-warming though...
