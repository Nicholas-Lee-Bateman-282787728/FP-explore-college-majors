2461137,5,B000CEXF8I,"I, like the other reviewers, really like Ellen Barrett's workout DVDs.  She does such an excellent job of cueing and preparing for ""adding on"" to each series.  This video isn't entirely different from her other DVDs, but it does incorporate some new yoga moves.  Although I love yoga, I can't do all of the standing forward bends (headache) that normally accompany a good yoga workout, so this was nice to hit some of my favorite poses without the head rush.  This is a well-rounded workout which includes pilates but won't exhaust you.  As with my other Ellen Barrett DVDs, I rotate them between my Janis Saffell kickbox DVDs and am very pleased to have another new workout from Ellen Barrett!",1142035200,2,694,4.75
2461138,5,B000CEXF8I,"First of all I love Ellen Barrett, you feel like your in the studio with her, she's a great instructor and I like her style. It's serious but light and fun and she's not obnoxious like allot of fitness instructors are out there. I have all of her Crunch Fitness DVD's so I have a variety of workouts I can do so I don't get bored and Crunch Fitness DVD's are one of the best lines out there and they are lucky to have Ellen as one of their instructors!!!!",1141948800,2,455,4.066666666666666
2461139,4,B000CEXF8I,"I've been doing yoga and pilates for a long time, so this workout was a little bit too easy for me.  I enjoyed the workout, but it was over before I knew it and I didn't feel challenged.  This would be a very good workout for someone who is relatively new to yoga or pilates.",1141689600,3,275,3.981818181818182
2461140,5,B000CEXF8I,"This is another great workout from Crunch and Ellen Barrett.  She's great in all the workouts of hers I have.  She cues very well and this is no exception.  This starts with standing yoga and moves onto floor/mat Pilates.  The Pilates section is a little longer, and it includes  mix of Pilates classics and weight-room-inspired toning routines.  This is a good and effective mix of Pilates and Yoga.  I really love this; it's relaxing and easy to incorporate into your other workouts about 4 times a week.  All up, it's about 40 minutes.",1141603200,83,538,4.709677419354839
2461141,5,B000CEXF8I,"This is a wonderful blend of flowing yoga and innovative pilates matwork. I usually don't like yoga, but loved this because the movements were faster and more flowing. The pilates section was challenging and effective. Ellen Barrett is one of my favorite instructors and this may be one of my favorite pilates workouts (in addition to Burn and Firm Pilates) that she's done. Highly recommend this one.",1141603200,6,401,5.0
2461142,5,B000CEXF8I,"Ellen is my favorite home video fitness instructor.  I am always challenged but never discouraged or injured by her programs.  I was so excited that she was releasing a new workout, and I was not disappointed.  The flowing yoga poses feel terrific and are easy to modify as needed.  There was enough flow between poses to work up a decent sweat, but still feel the calming & centering benefits of a yoga routine.  The Pilates exercises were challenging and satisfying.  This is by far my favorite of all Ellen's workouts. I hope she keeps them coming!",1140998400,6,551,4.6875
2461143,5,B000CEXF8I,"I Just got this DVD and tried it. I love it! It has alot of variety, one of those workouts that make you feel stretched and relaxed at the end. I do this tape in between my body sculpting workouts(The Firm), it helps with soreness. I have just about all of Ellen's workout DVDs and they all are great well-taught FUN programs!!",1140393600,2,327,4.290322580645161
2461144,5,B000CEXF8I,"I just did this workout this morning and I really liked it. I kept popping and snapping(but in a good way), even though I workout regularly. So, I knew I was getting a good stretch/workout.

It made me feel good when I was done.

I'll definitely do this one regularly.",1137715200,17,268,4.34
2461145,4,B000CEXF8I,"I was actually going to wait for this to become available on Amazon, but happened to spot it at Wal-Mart. I purchased it and tried it out the next morning. I consider myself to be moderate in the exercise department. I did not feel like I had done much of anything after the workout, but when I awoke the next morning. My lower abs and inner thighs are a bit sore. I will keep at this. It is a Yoga Pilates blended workout. I love Ellen Barrett as an instructor. I have two of her Crunch Pilates workouts and I have to say she is an excellent instructor. I am going to keep at it and see how if any slimming down occurs.",1136764800,20,620,4.048780487804878

2461213,5,B000CEXF8I,"I used to do this workout years ago when Netflix had workout videos; then one day they were gone.  I have been searching for this DVD for quite some time now and I was thrilled to find it here.  It is a perfect workout for days you do not want to go to the gym, I find it very relaxing and it really works my core.  I love Ellen in all of the Crunch videos; I wish she was an instructor at my Crunch gym in Los Angeles.",1478217600,4,419,3.7386363636363638

2461271,4,B000CEXF8I,This is a good mix of yoga postures and Pilates mat exercises. Ellen has good cuing and descriptions of the moves. I like it because it is gentle but effective and it is done with bare feet. The only equipment required is a yoga mat. I own several of her videos and this is one of my favorites.,1469923200,2,294,4.086206896551724
2461272,5,B000CEXF8I,"I love this workout. I've been using it for a few years and it still leaves me feeling stretched out and limber. It's a little cardio but not enough to really make you sweat and it's a little yoga which will stretch you as much as you take it. Although the cues are pretty easy to follow, if you're a first-timer to yoga or pilates, you'll need to keep your eyes on the screen; not because she doesn't show examples before going into the moves, but because there's little attention to good form or breath (although it's not completely negated either). It really is a great core workout overall - when you do the poses correctly you'll notice every move through this 40-minute workout extends from your core. I would recommend this as a pre-workout or a morning workout. Definitely not something to use alone if you're trying to lose weight.",1469404800,,840,4.569536423841059
2461273,5,B000CEXF8I,"The music is so good in this video -- it's like a cool blend of eastern beauty with a western beat, which I love -- so the workout makes me feel happy and harmonious. If you respond to music, you'll like this.  Ellen's cues are easy to follow, and she radiates warmth without being too chatty.  I also saw a quick difference in the tone of my abs.  I'm glad this workout is in my video library!",1468540800,,394,4.090909090909091
2461274,5,B000CEXF8I,"I watched my daughter do these exercises and was hooked!
She watched me do yoga since 1970's

I love Ellen Barrett's lively and deceptively simple delivery!

2461314,5,B000CEXF8I,"great video for stretching, strengthening and relaxing.  you can do this barefoot and in your pajamas (I've done it) and it feels great.  good for beginners and intermediate levels, but if you are very fit or do advanced yoga/pilates it might not be enough for you.

2461358,3,B000CEXF8I,"Got this because I was looking for a yoga/pilates hybrid workout I could do at home to save some time...yeah I turned it off 3/4 way through because I was so bored and the setting, music, pretty much everything was starting to get on my nerves which was totally counterproductive! I did give it to my mom and she liked it so I gave it an okay rating. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is even average fitness level in pilates or yoga maybe a beginner in these areas...my mom usually only walks or bikes for fitness but those aren't viable options year round as she is getting older so she is trying to get into other things and does like the ""flow"" of this video.",1443657600,,670,4.283464566929134
2461359,5,B000CEXF8I,This is an excellent beginners workout because there are so many variations and once you get better you adapt to the more strenuous levels. One of my favorite go tos.,1438041600,,166,4.566666666666666
2461360,4,B000CEXF8I,"I did this workout this morning for the first time and really enjoyed it.  It's got a lovely flow, and some moves I hadn't encountered before (I'm not a yoga or pilates expert, although I've done my share of both). I didn't find it super challenging, but I think it's a really good example of ""the more you put into it, the more you get out of it.""  I think it's a workout I can grow with.  I'm definitely looking forward to doing it again.",1437350400,,440,4.152941176470589
2461381,5,B000CEXF8I,"This DVD gives your whole body a workout and I enjoy the combination of Yoga and Pilates. I was first introduced to Ellen Barret from her exercise videos through Netflix.

2461382,5,B000CEXF8I,This remains one of my favorite workout videos of all time as well as one of my favorite instructors. I have several yoga/pilates videos (lots ellen videos) but this one is the best in my opinion. I actually lost a good deal of weight a few years ago by doing this workout regularly and dieting. It's definitely a great workout and one with great instruction--does not disappoint!,1433721600,,380,4.686567164179104

2461385,5,B000CEXF8I,"Ellen is a fantastic instructor.  What's amazing about her is that she uses key words every time.  This makes it extremely effective to follow along with the dvd, while not concentrating on the screen to make sure you don't miss something.  Now, you can focus on your workout and breathing, waiting for her cue words that will move you from one exercise to the next.  I have repeatedly used this workout just because I enjoy the exercises and Ellen.  Get ready to hurt in the morning; this will tone you from head to toe.

I had never taken a yoga or pilates class in my life, so being easy to follow is essential. Also, within a week of doing it daily, I already began to see- and feel- the results! It's definitely a good one if you don't have time for the gym everyday or are just starting out. Just be aware that your legs will absolutely be sore the next day.",1409702400,,502,4.08080808080808

She is easy to follow, straightforward...I guess I should say that she doesn't reek of fake enthusiasm or yell at you.  She is encouraging at just the right moments.  This is a great flow of yoga/pilates.  This was my introduction to both and I've found that I stand straighter, I'm more flexible, and I'm toned and stronger.  This is a great core work out for beginners as well as maintainers.  I think if people are looking for more difficult challenges (positions)--this won't do it for you.

The moves I learned translated into my Turbo Kick Boxing class, Yoga, and Brazillian Butt Lift classes.  These videos broke down the basics while giving me a really good workout.

2461470,5,B000CEXF8I,This is a great stretching and strengthening workout for those in between days when you need it! Ellen is a great instructor and very upbeat!,1389225600,,141,4.68
2461471,5,B000CEXF8I,"This is still one of my absolute favorite workout DVDs. This first time I watched this I had no prior yoga or Pilates experience, but it found very easy to follow along with the moves and workouts. The flows are very nice and keep a steady pace, that's easy to keep up with even as a beginner. I find it's a perfect speed -- t's slower than Pilates, yet a quicker pace then most yoga DVDs. I still use this at least once a week. I watched it originally on netflix until they removed it, So I was extremely excited to see it offered on Amazon prime. I do not think you will be disappointed in this workout. I only wish they sold the DVD direct through amazon (I don't like using amazon marketplace).",1388793600,,698,4.2164179104477615
2461472,4,B000CEXF8I,"I highly recommend any videos with Ellen Barrett.  She gives clear instructions and encouragement to keep you rolling on the floor, getting covered in dog hair.  I loved that this stretched my body and worked my core without having to do a bunch of crunches or boring sun salutations, which I am super bored with--plus I found a lot of neat things I'd lost under my couch!  I really felt this one in my shoulders and core.  It's fortunate that they offered a modified version of the exercises since towards the end I was flagging and I work out pretty regularly--there's something on here to challenge everyone.  This DVD might actually be worth buying, although I'd probably get sick of all the triangle-pose stuff fairly quickly.",1386806400,,731,4.76984126984127
2461473,5,B000CEXF8I,This is my favorite light day workout from Ellen.  This works well for me after 3-4 days of hard workouts.  I like the stretching and slower pace of this and find it to be relaxing yet invigorating.  This video was the first that I purchased that featured Ellen Barrett and most likely the one that hooked me on her workouts.  I highly recommend it for anyone at any fitness level.,1386547200,,381,4.4
2461474,5,B000CEXF8I,"This is great for someone beginning yoga or Pilates.  I was able to keep up and I felt as though I had a good workout.  I  take a cardio dance class 3 days a week so this workout is a nice change on the other days.  The music is soothing, and the instructor is easy to follow.  If all of the Crunch videos are this good, I will probably be looking for more as a variety.",1386460800,,370,3.8157894736842106
2461475,5,B000CEXF8I,I checked this out from my local library and really liked it so I bought it. I really like the different levels of workout depending on what level you are. I do this program a couple times a week and do other programs on other days. It helps with flexibility and strength and is really fun and up-beat.,1386115200,,302,4.224137931034483
2461476,5,B000CEXF8I,I enjoyed this video so much I bought a couple more featuring Ellen Barrett. They are easy to follow and enjoyable to do. I haven't yet been consistent enough to see full results but of all of my workout DVD's I grab these every time. The instructor really makes all the difference.,1386115200,,282,4.4423076923076925

2461478,5,B000CEXF8I,"Though its older, one of Ellen's best overall Pilates workout. You'll know you've worked out after this one yet it remains low impact. Also has variations of levels at points for a variety of exercisers.",1381276800,,203,4.828571428571428
2461479,5,B000CEXF8I,"After reading the good reviews on this workout, I purchased CRUNCH - Super Slim Down Pilates Yoga Blend via an exhaustive internet search about two years ago. It was worth the time and effort I put into finding this as it wasn't available on Amazon.

This is a great workout, being a beginner exerciser at the time with no upper body strength the DVD was easy to follow with Ellen Barrett's excellent cueing. I worked up a sweat and the workout was hard for me as a couch potato with the cardio fitness and strength of a ... potato.

I have visible obliques now (!!!) after using this on-off with CRUNCH: Fat Burning Pilates (also with Ellen). I also have CRUNCH: Pick Your Spot Pilates and there is a move in there I think it's called the mermaid - you sit with your legs in a sort of zig zag and bend to the side twisting your body as you go down. When lifting up you need to use your side muscles to lift you up, I used to never be able to lift myslf up without pushing off with my hands (which Ellen says not to do).

Somewhere along the line while using Fat Burning Pilates and this DVD my oblique muscles have become so much stronger that I now glide up off the floor. I was so surprised the first time I achieved this after having not done the Pick Your Spot Pilates workout and the mermaid move/stretch for awhile.

In short, this workout does work ... I have better upper body strength now (though it's still a work in progress because I was lazy for so long). My clothes fit better and if I wasn't a sugar/junk food addict I'd probably actually shed some weight too! I usually precede this workout with about 20 minutes of interval (speeds) running on the treadmill. My old Pilates instructor says it's good to do cardio before a Pilates workout as it warms your muscles up first.

Wish they'd start manufacturing this DVD again so more people can benefit from the workout - especially those who don't live in the USA as the DVD isn't available at Target stores internationally.",1379808000,,1988,4.376693766937669

2461501,5,B000CEXF8I,"It's the best Yoga,Pilates,and Dance infused workout on the market. 45 minutes. There is a lot of floor work. Which is good for those of us with limited mobility.

2461502,5,B000CEXF8I,I absolutely love this workout video.  The instructor is wonderful at alternating from a strenuous move to a not-so-strenuous move that keeps your heart pumping and the want to keep moving.  Highly recommend for any pilates or yoga fanatic.,1377129600,,240,5.128205128205129

I've done lots of work out videos in the past and haven't liked any of them because the instructors sucked. Not only is this video awesome but Ellen has so many other videos that are great too! I don't go to the gym anymore because Ellen's videos suffice for me and have shaped my body in such a great way. I am slimmer all over, especially in my thighs, butt and abs. She gives you a dancers like body which I think most women love, I know I do. I feel so happy after this particular video, this one is my favorite hands down.

2461557,2,B000CEXF8I,"Despite the awesomely aggressive brand name ""Crunch,"" this was a pretty mild video. To give you some perspective about where my review is coming from, I'm not new to yoga. I've been practicing on and off since about 2012. I'm athletic, but I workout once every two weeks, if that, and I'm not flexible at all. I still can't touch my toes.

With all those limitations, I still thought the instruction in this video was pretty basic. There was a core section that was challenging, but the rest was - I'll say it - boring. There were few holds and a lot of ""and pump it, pump it"" sort of language. I didn't feel like I was toning much. I didn't even break a sweat. I get a much better workout at generic gym yoga.

This video is for people who have never taken a yoga class, who never workout (beware of the core section, don't pull your back), and just generally hate holding poses in yoga. If you like the ""and pump it, in 5-4-3-2, ONE MORE SET"" sort of aerobic flows, you may like this.",1365811200,,986,4.267379679144385

It came in especially handy after my favorite pilates/yoga instructor left my gym and I was not too fond of the replacement.
I even practiced this workout thru the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy - there is an option for a less challenging routine by watching the one girl to the right (in the video). I love it & highly recommend this video!",1359417600,,497,4.02020202020202

I began doing this workout while it was still on Netflix instant play and fell in love with it.  I preferred it over Ellen's other pilates workouts because I felt like it's a total workout and actually made me sweat.  I was planning for my upcoming wedding at the time, and although I have always worked out (running/lifting weights), my then-fiance (now husband) was encouraging me to strengthen my core.  Even he was impressed with the results.  I agree with what one person said in that it is a great addition to your collection/workout routine, although you've got to combine it with other types of excercise.  I would encourage any beginner or yoga/pilates virgin to try it a few times and you will definitely find yourself standing up straighter, feeling more flexible, and seeing some toned results!",1359158400,,932,4.830188679245283

Also, when she lies on her side for leg lifts but props her head up on her bent arm instead of laying it flat on an outreached arm, I feel this puts a strain on your neck.

I have been neglecting to do these types of exercises in my workouts and my lower back had begun to suffer for it, so I've been trying workouts like these. While I was doing it it didn't seem THAT challenging, but boy was I sore the next day! It's probably pretty standard beginner-level pilates type stuff, the little yoga included is VERY basic and trust me, you do not have to be flexible to do it because I am not flexible at all but it was still a good stretching/toning workout and I was sweating by the end (just not out of breath, it's not that kind of workout).

2461658,5,B000CEXF8I,"I have been wanting to do Pilates forever, but I won't go to a class by myself. Since I couldn't find any of my friends that were willing to try it, I started looking for videos on here.
Just so you know, I tend to be on the lazy side. I don't heavily monitor my diet, but I limit fried food. I scavenger eat other people's. The kids are used to it. Lol. I received my video, and keep your eye on price, I did not pay $50 for mine. The workout is challenging, but not in a way that you can't get through it. What I love about this type of workout is that it's actually relaxing as well. I have a very overactive brain and this really helps me focus on my body and it quiets my mind. I also have daily upper back pain and this really helps with that. I am used to just loading up on ibuprofen and making my hubs rub it. Now that I typed that, I realized that I am hardly taking any ibuprofen anymore.
I have been doing it at least three times a week for a little over two weeks and I can already tell a difference in my body. I did Kosama for almost a month and didn't see this much of a change. It's not a huge change, but I can see it in my abs and a little in my tush. Plus, my clothes are fitting a little looser. Subtle but appreciated change.
If this will be the first time you have ever done yoga or Pilates, I will tell you that there isn't much information on the importance of breathing and how to do it. It's vital to the workout. I still catch myself holding my breath, so I really have to focus. If you are breathing right, it's almost like doing a stomach crunch every time you breathe.
Don't look at this as a workout. Look at it as a way to become in touch with your body and appreciate yourself. It's a great way to relieve stress.
I love it! Give it a go!",1354752000,3,1772,3.925
2461659,5,B000CEXF8I,"I like that this workout hits the 40+ minute marker. There isn't a consolidated stretching point, but she somewhat integrates it into the workout.  I tried another one of her workout videos, and didn't like it as much, but this one gets into a rhythm and you don't have to stare at the tv the whole time to figure out what in the world she is doing every 20 seconds.  It doesn't require anything but a mat, so it will make a great take along (via kindle fire) while on travel.  I think this will be good for getting me in condition to do a Mary Helen Bowers workout.  This is no where near as hard, but you have to start somewhere.",1354492800,,631,4.147540983606557
2461660,4,B000CEXF8I,"This DVD is excellent.  I love that it is only 40 minutes, but still packs in a lot during that time.  I can see results the day after doing this and I always come back to this DVD when I feel like I need to tone up, or haven't been working out much.  I am a student and found this very easy to do in any space.  Even a dorm room.

In response to some of the 1 star reviews, you may be doing some of the moves wrong.  Always follow her directions in regards to tightening your abdomen.  This DVD enforces quality not quantity, so really concentrate on how your body is positioned and make sure the movement is very controlled.  The warrior pulse at the beginning was a little much for me at the start, but I have come to realize how much I love the warrior pulse. It really gets your body energized for the remainder of the workout.

There are moves from this DVD that are really great to have in your workout arsenal.  Opposite arm Opposite leg, warrior pulse, little piece of heave, all of the leg work and plank moves.  Some of the moves from this DVD I have memorized and can use them when I don't have the DVD, like in a hotel room, or on vacation.  And just doing a few of them in the morning makes me feel very energized, and also tones really really well.

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because of the price listed here.  I am confused by this.  I bought this in 2005 for somewhere around $10 and since then I have recommended this to many people.  I came to buy it for my sister and was shocked at the 69.99 price.  I mean, its worth it, but I won't be paying that for a 40 min workout DVD.  Try to find it elsewhere.",1353542400,4,1650,4.024615384615385

Meaning, I am more aware of my abs, back and shoulders thereby keeping them in line and tightened. This in turn has helped with easing pain. This workout and the one with her in blue on the cover are my favorite for my non-cardio days. I plan to use this workout to get stronger so that I may move on to more advanced Pilates.

And just when i would feel a good stretch or burn in whatever we were doing, we would move on. I haven't done a ton of yoga in my day but it was all longer poses and stretches.

2461729,3,B000CEXF8I,"Having started to really enjoy yoga, I decided to try this DVD to continue to do yoga while experimenting with pilates, something that I haven't really ever tried before.  I found this workout to be very easy to do and great for the body as it tones your muscles while stretching and relaxing other muscles at the same time, which really keeps you from being sore the next day.  However, you repeat each move so many times that it simply get boring after a while, and because the moves are not really challenging, it just has you counting down the minutes until the workout is over.  The moves are usually yoga postures with a pilates type twist on them such as pulsing or twisting; you then repeat this move many times, holding it almost every time.  The moves are very flowing though, which makes most of them feel very nice.  The moves seem to focus on legs and abs, and while I wasn't sore the next day because of the stretching done with the moves and after the workout, I still felt my muscles (especially my abs) working while I was doing the moves.  Ellen Barrett, the instructor of this workout, is very pleasant and friendly as an instructor.  She cues well and give motivation throughout the workout.  My biggest flaw with this is just that it is very, very boring to me, although an extreme beginner to exercise might think differently.  It is easy enough for a beginner to do, but an intermediate/advanced exerciser might appreciate it more for it's flow and feel-good quality.  I have to say that I don't really recommend this DVD; I'd suggest finding another yoga/pilates workout.",1297728000,2,1595,4.624113475177305

The catch is that in order to do this, you have to be willing to really engage those core muscles. Mine are weak, but they're strong enough i can tighten them (""scoop your abdomen,"" as Ellen directs) and really FEEL them working. I can imagine that if you're not feeling this workout, you're either not engaging your core as needed, or else you've got a strong enough core that this workout is too low-level for you. It's definitely not for higher levels.",1295654400,3,623,4.417391304347826

2461759,5,B000CEXF8I,"When I read reviews, I often find that people say they saw ""results"" with out explaining what these ""results"" are.  Let me prelude by saying, I am in my late 20's, within normal weight and BMI range, and for the most part I eat decent (could be healthier).  My weight loss goals at any given time have always been less than 10 pounds.  I am an intermediate but inconsistent exerciser and have substantial experience with pilates  but not yoga.  I look good when covered up, but once summer rolls around, I turn into a self conscious woman.  My major problem areas are  my rear and thighs! I have a few dimples, they are a little flabby, and most workouts I try don't seem to be effective in toning!
I have owned this DVD for over a year now.  Unfortunately I am not always consistent in working out, I am a doctoral student with an extremely busy schedule! However, when I actually consistently do the workouts, I see changes in my body in no time!  Currently I have been using it for almost 3 weeks, (approximately 19 days), and doing the workouts Tues, Thurs, and Sunday!  During this time, I have not done any cardio, and my diet is still the same (lots of put together meals like sandwiches, fruits, salads, t.v dinners, and lots of ice-cream).  Looking in the mirror I see definition in my stomach. It is flatter, and I do not have that stomach bulge when I am wearing my tight jeans and my external obliques are visible.  Also, my butt is more defined and rounded, and the dimples are gone! My inner and outer thighs, are more toned (but no where near where I want them to be). Overall there is less jiggle!  I have a pair of shorts I use as a measure of success, and I am pleased to report that I am wearing them now, and ready to walk out the door in them.  In the past when I have done this video for longer than 3 months, my whole body transforms, my butt, thighs and stomach look amazing, and my results are quicker and more visible, in comparison to my friends who go to the gym (though this may just simply be an issue of different body types, metabolism etc).
As others have mentioned it is low impact and you might feel like you are not working hard, especially for seasoned exercisers, but you just have to keep with it, and you will see how amazing you will look.  Last summer, my boyfriend, a very fit personal trainer did the routine with me, and was sore for days to come!
I highly recommend this dvd.  I should add that if your goal is to lose weight, you have to add cardio! This alone will not be enough!",1273363200,26,2527,4.29957805907173

I find it especially beneficial when I have been spending too long at the computer (an occupational hazard), and my body is all tensed up. It stretches all parts of the body, but I find it exceptionally good for releasing tension in the shoulders and upper back, which don't get targeted as well in other workouts. It is also great for stretching out the legs, without needing to do more complicated aerobics-style choreography. This makes it seem easier to handle when I am mentally tired, yet does still work out the body well. The pilates-inspired components work out the core really well, and I can really feel my abdominals towards the end of the routine. The music is complementary to the exercises and is upbeat enough to keep you motivated. Ellen is a great instructor who provides lots of cues and information on how to perform the exercises correctly. Some exercises will take a few goes to get them right, but the persistence is definitely worth it with this one.",1269129600,2,1062,4.684491978609626

And I honestly didn't think it worked me out very much.  But it's sneaky!  I was a little sore the next day. I love that there are other women in the video as well and you have the option to do a modified version, if you so choose.  I love the flow of the movements and even if I'm not really feeling up to snuff one day, I do my workout and always feel so much better afterwards. I've been doing Pilates for years now, but even if you're a beginner this will be good for you.  You don't need to be double-jointed.  I prefer Pilates/Yoga over other routines because I don't want to add bulk to my very small frame. Pilates/Yoga adds strength,balance, peace and flexibility.

2461781,4,B000CEXF8I,"I enjoyed this video very much.  It is not a traditional yoga workout where you hold the poses and concentrate on breathing and meditation. Instead it is about ""pulsing"" yoga where you move in and out of a pose.

 This type of exercise, pulsing in and out of ""yogic"" postures gives you a slight cardio workout and keeps it moving and flowing. But if you are a person who prefers traditional yoga, you will not find it here.

One thing I really enjoyed about this dvd is that I experienced totally different moves I had never encountered before. And it felt fun to do them. As I was doing the new moves I was thinking how good it felt.  While I was working hard it was fun!

This is a perfect workout for those in between days when you don't want to do anything intense but just some light, but effective, toning and stretch.  It also concentrates on the core and is a very doable 42 minutes.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that compared to some other ""pulsing"" type yogic workouts I have (""Power Yoga Plus"" and ""Fat Blasting Yoga"", this one is mild and gives less significant less cardio than I had hoped for.  I was hoping for a bit more of a challenge than it delivered but it is still a wonderful workout out and a fine addition to your workout library.",1260316800,3,1276,4.261410788381743

2461791,5,B000CEXF8I,"I enjoy my yoga and have not really worked out with Pilates that often, tried it a couple of times but have not started using it as part of my routines.  I have been interested in some of the exercises that combine both together to try them, so picked this DVD up.

I have been really enjoying it so far and the workouts are ones that you can really feel.  It is not either standard pilates or yoga, as the title says, it is a combination of both of them with yoga moves and pilates moves, so keep that in mind in case you are looking for workouts that are solely one or the other.

But even if you do want just one or the other, this is still worth having for days you would like to do both, I have found myself liking pilates and will probably begin to add some more.  I found the instruction clear on both the yoga and pilates side and can follow the pilates (I had a handle on the yoga side beforehand, but can say that even without a real pilates background I was able to learn from this, in other words it works for a beginner.)",1250121600,,1034,4.049019607843137

It is effective, well led and definitely not boring. Ellen is cheery without being annoying and the program can be adapted for many ages and skill levels. It is important to follow her positioning instructions carefully. Having done yoga for several years, this is a nice, up-tempo workout that uses some of the same postures (Triangle, warrior, down dog) along with some classic pilates movements.

This is definitely a worthwhile investment.",1246665600,3,712,4.780487804878049

The moves and positions really make you work; it's totally worth every penny!",1245024000,,317,4.482758620689655
2461806,4,B000CEXF8I,"I was annoyed with this video at first because I'm more accustomed to doing yoga and I wondered, where's the yoga in this? Sure, you do some yoga poses in the early sections like downward dog, triangle, and child's pose, but that's as far as the resemblance goes. But I liked it a lot better once I understood what it really is-- a pilates workout that uses yoga poses as the basis for certain sequences. If you're looking for a calming, meditative yoga routine, you won't find it here, and it's quite different even from doing power/vinyasa yoga. Plus, Ellen's aggressively cheerful spunkiness may very well drive you batty. She's very much a pilates teacher rather than a yoga teacher, and as a pilates teacher she's great. It's a good workout for pilates beginners and introduces you to some classic pilates moves like teaser, leg circles, side kicks, and the C-curve. I just wish it was a full hour and not just 40 minutes (but when you start, 40 minutes will feel like an eternity to your abs).",1243123200,,999,4.617977528089888
2461807,5,B000CEXF8I,"I wanted to get into better shape, but I'm not really one for cardio videos, and my gym membership had expired months ago. However, I tried Yoga for the first time last fall in a gym class at school, and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I could tell that I was getting a workout, and yet I was having fun while doing it. Thus, I decided to purchase a couple of Yoga and Pilates DVDs, and this happened to be one of them. And let me just say how absolutely thrilled I am with my purchase!

This DVD is a fantastic blend of both Yoga and Pilates moves that are fun, easy-to-learn, and yet give your body a great stretch and a great workout. Again, I've never been one for workout videos, and the few that I've tried I've stopped using after a few days because they're either too hard to break into or I just get tired of them. This, however, I'm actually excited to do when I get home at night; it's a great way to workout and get in your daily exercise, but is also a great tool to help you unwind at the end of the day as well. I actually look forward to doing this DVD each night!

I also love Ellen Barrett. She is a fabulous instructor who knows what she's doing and knows how to best get you through the workout. She helps coach you along and motivate you without being overly loud or peppy or energetic; she's calm and relaxing and yet still motivational, which I love.

The workout is also great for beginners to both yoga and/or Pilates. I had only ever done the one yoga workout when I first tried this DVD, and was not exceptionally flexible or in-shape, and yet it was extremely easy for me to get into this workout. That's not to say that it's not challenging and that you don't feel it afterward, because you definitely do - I still feel the burn from it and I do this workout just about everyday - but it's at a slow enough pace and moves through gently enough, easing you into all of the positions, that it's a great DVD to start with if you're new to yoga/Pilates.

If you're thinking about purchasing a yoga/Pilates DVD, definitely give this one a try, particularly if you're new to these types of workouts. It's definitely worth the price and you'll be thrilled with your purchase!!

EDIT: As with many workout DVDs, after doing this DVD nearly everyday for a week and a half, many of the exercises became less challenging and I felt like I was getting less of a workout. I ended up moving on to some of Ellen Barrett's other Crunch Cardio-style Pilates videos (which I also love), and have started to use this DVD for days when I'm tired/sore or just feel like doing a less challenging workout. As this is a much more ""relaxed"" workout (no cardio moves, slower transitions, etc), it's the perfect choice for days like that; however, you do still get a good stretch, and at roughly 40 minutes, it's still worth doing and gives you a pretty good workout.",1240790400,4,2877,4.32037037037037
2461808,5,B000CEXF8I,"(MALE REVIEWER) I caught Ellen Barrett on a TV program and really enjoyed her style: tough with a smile. Although on this DVD she did not use weights, she pushes you enough to work up a nice sweat. The emphasis is on core and lower-body work, especially your glutes. Men may have to modify (or at least be careful) of some of the front-lying exercises but that's easily done. At a little over 40 minutes, the workout is perhaps a little short, but for 7.99 it is a bargain to say the least. I would recommend it, especially for beginners and intermediate-level exercisers.

2461811,5,B000CEXF8I,"This workout is a fusion of yoga and pilates.  All the moves flow from one to another.  So it is a non stop of fluid graceful moves.  You will feel your muscles warming and stretching with every move.  Ellen targets the entire body using your own body weight.  You will also feel very graceful while performing the moves.  Your core will also feel these movements.  In this workout Ellen starts with standing poses and then ends with a floor routine.  Your core and muscles get worked differently.  You also get posture, balance and flexibility benefits.  I think including these types of  body weight exercises are a great addition to traditional strength training.

""Super Slim Down"" is a little easier than Ellen's newest ""Yogini"" workout.  Since both have different exercises they complement each other quite well.  Having both in my collection are great to add to any rotation.

The set is typical of ""Crunch"" workouts.  The music was appropriate and didn't interfere with the workout.  The camera angles allowed you to see all the moves without difficulty.",1239062400,,1062,4.943181818181818

She also does 3-4 sets of every exercise so at least by the last time, you can catch on. I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes yoga and pilates.",1219017600,,549,4.392156862745098
2461852,4,B000CEXF8I,"For reference: I'm an avid gymrat--I exercise 5 days a week doing weights, cardio, and anything else that strikes my fancy. I really enjoyed this workout; I found the exercises challenging but not too crazy or hard that I had to stop. I've seen or done most of the poses from this video before so I didn't feel too out of my realm. This is not meditative or relaxing in any shape or form (hence, ""SlimDown,"" nothing aimed at losing weight is relaxing!)--it is purely exercise. I do not consider this Yoga since a key component in Yoga is meditation. They USE Yoga poses and stretches, and they do Pilates exercises, but it is every bit an exercise video as Jane Fonda and her leg warmers.
I only gave it 4 stars because the instructor's voice is incredibly obnoxious and cheerleader-y.",1216857600,,785,4.574468085106383
2461853,5,B000CEXF8I,"Let me begin by saying for the price of this DVD it is totally worth it.  Second of all, it is an awesome pilates and yoga workout!  I cannot afford a gym membership so I make my home my gym.  I have a treadmill, weights, and a weight bench.  I also have about 20 different DVDs, both cardio (Tae Bo, bootcamp ones) and yoga and pilates ones.  This DVD though tops them all!  I have other DVDs of Ellen's (and they're all great) but this is my favorite.  The flowing moves, the repetition, and the music is very relaxing, but it also offers an amazing workout.  You can really see your core working hard.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes yoga and pilates.  I would also recommend Ellen's level DVD (the one where you can pick from 3 different workout levels).  I teach yoga and pilates at a summer camp and I brought the level one in to do with the kids and they loved it and kept requesting to do it again!  I will be doing this one with them, too!  I think I will have the same results with this one as well!  Hope you enjoy the DVD!",1215216000,,1057,4.117647058823529

I'm going to admit that I only do this workout once or twice a month because I tend to reach more for my circuit training DVDs. However, when my stress level peaks, I do this workout. I feel relaxed and energized when I'm done with it. Out of my 40+ exercise DVDs, I only have 3 yoga/pilates kind [Denise Austin's Power Yoga Plus, Yoga Booty Ballet and this one]. I used this the most 'coz my core could really feel it afterwards ..and at 43 years old, I'd like to maintain a waistline and prevent my mid-section from growing 'outward/forward'.

She even offers some modifications for some of the poses.  Not your typical Yoga DVD where you relax and breathe slowly, and there aren't the typical Sun Salutation poses.

2461884,5,B000CEXF8I,"This is a great workout, especially for days when you're thinking, ""hmm...should I do yoga? nah...how about pilates??"" While it may not be the strictest video in the sense of specific yoga or pilates moves, it does highlight the best of each, in my opinion.

The workout is really well-organized. Each segment has a series of exercises that are paired with other complementary movements so your body is worked from all angles. It starts with some breathing exercises and moves to a Warrior Pulse/side angle stretch exercise. I love this. It is a great way to warm up the body. Then it goes into a triangle/warrior 1&2 pose sequence; after that a leg beat/back extension/little piece of heaven routine. The willow/dolphin sequence is next--this is a good one for the back and core muscles. The workout ends with an ab routine that is pretty challenging. Oh--and somewhere in between all of that is a side-lying leg extension sequence that is great.

All in all, this is a wonderful workout. As usual, Ellen Barrett is a great instructor who cues well and knows her stuff. I always put this workout in on ""light"" days, but end up getting as much out of it as any other workout. I really feel it working during and afterwards!",1200441600,,1223,4.710280373831775
2461885,5,B000CEXF8I,I borrowed this DVD from a friend for a week and I'm buying my own copy now. It's a great workout that tones your muscles while incorporating stretching.  The instructor is very pleasant and explains the moves well.,1200355200,,215,4.657894736842105
2461886,5,B000CEXF8I,"Ellen Barrett's outstanding teaching technique emphasizes a steady pace with sustained effort and  proper form.

Anyone who has done pilates knows that proper breathing technique and good form are essential. Unfortunately, many pilates teachers skip the set-up phase of an exercise. Instead of giving you the time to get into proper position, they rush right into the exercise. This not only results in improper breathing and poor form, but also exhausts the muscles prematurely. You therefore miss the benefits inherent in the exercise, get frustrated quickly, and run the risk of injuring yourself.

On the other hand, some DVD instructors have tried to compensate by allowing too much time for the set-up phase. They teach at such a slow pace that you may feel bored in between exercises, and find that your muscles never feel truly warmed up.

Ellen's perfect pacing includes just enough time for set-up. In keeping with basic principals of yoga, she also provides excellent stretches (such as cobra, child's pose and cat stretch) in between each of the vigorous pilates moves to help you release tension from the muscles.

Ellen Barrett is one of the few teachers that I implicitly trust to provide me with a perfect blend of exercises that leave me feeling great--toned but not tight, taller, leaner and more energized. I also have her Fat Burning Fusion DVD, a challenging standing pilates/ ballet workout that also has excellent cuing.

If you like her DVD, you might also want to try Kari Anderson's ""Angles Lines and Curves"" or ""Reach"".<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kari-Anderson-Angles-Lines-Curves-Vol-2/dp/B000GTJSTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kari Anderson: Angles, Lines & Curves, Vol. 2</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kari-Anderson-Reach-Upbeat-Toning-Flexibility-for-a-Dancer-s-Body/dp/B000EGDN68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kari Anderson: Reach - Upbeat Toning & Flexibility for a Dancer's Body</a>",1200096000,,1997,6.139784946236559

After some getting used to and becoming more physically fit in general, I have found that this workout is far better for flexibility than it is for strengthening.

I highly recommend the video, just not as a weight-loss or cardiovascular fitness tool. This video is a great supplement to a full fitness regiment. I've owned this video for about a year now and I still use it in my regular rotation.

As a side note, Ellen Barrett is a fantastic instructor. She's personable and gives great direction. I own several of her videos and would highly recommend anything she's put out.",1197072000,,715,4.578125
2461899,5,B000CEXF8I,"I love this video. It's perfect for the in between days that I don't hit the gym. Along with 25 - 30 minutes of cardio, it provides just enough, so that I don't feel like I'm totally slacking. If you're looking for something strenuous, this is in no way it. This could never take the place of a gym workout, but you do a little work and get a little stretch. So, the DVD can work into your weekly workout routine very nicely - a little calm between the storms! It goes by very quickly. Ellen Barrett has a good personality for these types of videos. She's not annoying or over-the-top. When I first started, I purchased her Pick Your Spot Pilates, which I liked as well. This graduates a little beyond that.
If you're advanced, this isn't for you. If you're into power workouts, this isn't for you. But if you're a gym rat that is looking for a little break and a little pick me up, it should suite you just fine. I would say that it's worth the money you'll spend.",1196294400,,965,4.25
2461900,5,B000CEXF8I,"I bought the 3-pack of Crunch's Pilates DVDs before buying this one, and you can really see the improvement in Ellen's teaching. (Or maybe it's the editing-- in earlier tapes they actually leave in the stuttering/blunders which make the workout seem a little less like a polished end-product.)

This workout is great for flexibility and some low impact strength training for your core.  It is NOT a cardio workout, so don't buy it if you are looking for Cardio.  Crunch Burn & Firm Pilates is better if that is what you are looking for.  Burn & Firm has been a staple for me, since you can do it with/without weights for whatever level you want to exert yourself.
Super Slimdown Pilates/Yoga Blend is more of a relaxing workout; something to do on the days you are just to tired after work to do a cardio workout, but want to do something that will still do some strengthening/toning.  Overall it's great.",1195171200,,905,4.63125

The odd thing is, though I don't feel like I'm pushing myself hard while doing this DVD, I feel strong and toned afterwards. In other words, it's a deceptively tough workout. It also works the whole body -- arms, legs and core. Elin Barrett's cues are flawless and she's very detailed about what muscles you should feel in each move, so it's great even for beginners. She's also upbeat and fun. I gave this as a gift to a friend who hates to work out and she raved about it. Said it was the best gift she's ever gotten.",1194912000,,675,4.322834645669292

2461920,5,B000CEXF8I,"The time flew by, and I think that's what makes this a great workout video.

In the past, I've taken a few Pilates classes which are a lot more challenging than they look. I was bit worried about buying this DVD, because I was worried that my form would be totally off, but she is a wonderful instructor. When she begins new workouts she lets you know and you start off with a few slow reps and they progressively get faster. She does a wonderful job at explaining how your form should be, but this are challenging exercises, so if you're someone who has done Pilates and Yoga you'll still enjoy this tape. I'm used to lifting free weights and decided it was time to add some varity and deffinately felt my arms throughout and after this workout.

2461921,3,B000CEXF8I,"Ellen is very upbeat but calm, great presence, she won't bore you & not a fake/chatty instructor. It's set in the usual Crunch stage w/7 other women, one doing the modifications.
Warm Up: is some breathing w/raised arms, tiny back bends & small amount of squats.
Standing yoga: warrior 2 a lot, side angle, slight back bend on that leg placement, breath w/hands & squat & then repeat on other side. Do this 4x on each side. To rest is breathing w/raised arms & down to squats, then small spinal rolls from standing to squats.
Standing Yoga 2: Triangle, warrior 2, warrior 1 & repeat 3x more on that same side. The zig zag is simple arm reach up & down for rest & stretch, very easy/cute. The triangle, warrior 2, warrior 1 on other side 4x & zig zag again. Plank w/knee to chest several times, downward facing dog & child's pose to rest.
All fours Mat work 1: Child's pose to kneeling position w/arms always raised is called ""willow"" & done a few times. Next is dolphin which is plank on your elbows. Do those 2 exercises 3x more. Next is table yoga on hands/knees & balance on 1 hand & knee w/flexing the raised limbs slightly up.
All fours Mat work 2: Do locust (on stomach raise legs), next is only raise the torso a few times. Then from lying on stomach, go to child's pose back/forth for a spinal loosener & arm toning several times. Locust again with legs moving in scissor then the lying on stomach/child's pose again a few times, repeat 3x. Lying on stomach, leg circles & child's pose.
Side Laying Mat work: Side lying double leg lifts, side lying ballerina leg lifts, pilates torso side stretch on knee & leg, lying back on elbows, knees to side back/forth & then having a single straight leg same thing several times, do all that now on other side including the lying back on elbows one & rest in Indian style modified butterfly.
Abs Mat work: sitting w/knees near chest, roll downs (modified teasers) then to full pilates teasers, then tiny roll downs w/arm squeezes to strengthen rhomboids, next is classic lying down pilates version of bicycle, then side lying oblique crunches, then ab crunches with legs raised & doing scissors.
Calming Cool down: sitting indian style, ballerina arms to stretch out the upper torso, upper back & arms, neck stretches & ends with more ballerina arms.

At first I found the music too fast & the yoga too aerobicized, too repetitive w/no attention to the breath. When she got to the mat work, the music changed to a little slower & since there was a lot of stretching in between, it felt more refreshing. I did feel stretched out a bit nicely & the work level of this is good for beginners or as a light day for those who workout at least semi regularly.
The music is from Daveed, so it is real music which helped my mood & enjoyment of this. Ellen seems to have some body awareness which is great to see & seems to go for an audience that gets bored easily w/slower workouts, but she does lose attention to correct form & when to breathe.
If you're a yoga or pilates enthusiast, you may be insulted by the lack of attention to form as well as not challenged, others may love this.

2461923,5,B000CEXF8I,"Starts of with the variations of warrior and triangle poses which are just adequate yoga moves to get you warmed up and body awakened. A bit rhythmical which takes the bore off the yoga. It ascends to a sneaky mat-cardio in the middle part. The backwork is excellent: variation of superman (swan), alternate arm and leg lifts on table top position- like what she says in ""the benefits are amazing"". Ellen Barrett is my favorite of all work-out DVD instructors. When I am tired and getting lazy, her DVD is the one I'd pop in the player and she gets me back on track.

2461924,5,B000CEXF8I,This is probably the best video workout I've ever seen. I get a great workout with easy to follow moves.,1180915200,,104,4.25
2461925,5,B000CEXF8I,I added this video to my morning workout routine and it is such a great way to start off the day!! I had more energy throughout the day and felt like I had done something.  It geared me up for my more intense workouts later too!,1180310400,4,228,3.9565217391304346
2461926,5,B000CEXF8I,"I have been doing this video for over a month now.  At first my muscles would really ache the next day, but I have begun to shape up well.  I do this everyday, my calves, arms and upper legs have shown great improvement.  Even when I am not feeling like doing anything I make myself do this video and I feel so much better after words.  I just ordered the burn and firm pilates because I think Ellen is so great.",1179187200,5,412,4.049382716049383
2461937,3,B000CEXF8I,"Yawn, this video got a little boring, although I did feel the wrokout, it couldn't keep me interested.",1179100800,,102,4.722222222222222
2461938,5,B000CEXF8I,"Great DVD!  She warms up nicely with great instruction.  Her moves are challenging.  I find the more I do them the better my form is.  At first I didn't feel like I was doing much but the better I get at the ""poses"" the more my heartrate increases.  It goes by really fast and some of the moves are very fun and ""flowy"".  You don't just hold a pose, you always blend it into something else.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone that considers themself at an intermediate level.",1179100800,3,478,4.2444444444444445
2461939,5,B000CEXF8I,A mid-beginner to early-intermediate comfortable workout.  For those of us who exercise reluctantly and despise overenthusiastic routines shouted to pounding background noise.  This workout will leave you comfortably damp but not totally wrung out.,1178928000,6,248,6.264705882352941
2461940,4,B000CEXF8I,"Ellen Barrett leads a great workout that is suitable for both beginner and intermediate levels. This workout makes me feel like I've been working very hard, and I love the way she makes the poses flow together. The only thing I don't like about this workout is that she never has you stretch your hamstrings afterward, so they'll feel sore the next day if you don't add a stretch.",1178668800,,380,4.521739130434782
2461941,5,B000CEXF8I,"I love this video, first of all Ellen is a great instructor, she is contstantly giving helpful cues, but is never annoying. The workout itself is not a cardio, but is very good at building muscle and creating that long lean look. Plus you will feel great after. I recommend this video to anyone.",1177632000,,295,4.481481481481482
2461942,5,B000CEXF8I,"With flawless cuing and fluid movement, Barrett is one the best instructors out there.  The added bonus of this workout is that not only do you get to strengthen your muscles, but you stretch them as well.  The standing yoga is excellent to work the tightness out of your hips, back, and along the sides of the torso.  This is a workout that you can do anytime to relax and tone.  I like doing it after a separate cardio workout for an added metabolic boost as well as great way to cool down and stretch.  A terrific addition to your DVD collection.",1177632000,2,549,4.3431372549019605
2461943,5,B000CEXF8I,"I've been using this pilates yoga blend workout for a few months now, and let me just say that I am definitely more toned in my core as well as more flexiable.  I most definitely recommend this workout to anyone who is at the beginners level or just wants ""to take a little less challenging route"" for the day.  If you are looking for more of a cardio workout, then I would recommend purchasing the fat burning pilates DVD because that burns a lot more calories.  Either way, this is a great workout, and it is extremely relaxing as well as it relieves a lot of stress!!",1176940800,3,570,4.308411214953271
2461944,5,B000CEXF8I,"I did the workout for the first time yesterday and today I ache.  But it's a good ache.  I'm feeling core muscles I never knew I had.  I have several of Ellen's videos and really like her instruction and personality.  I'd definitely recommend this if you're looking to strengthen your whole body.  There is no cardio, but that doesn't mean you won't work hard.",1176595200,3,360,4.5625
2461945,4,B000CEXF8I,"Found this workout easy to follow.  Ellen give good cues on techniques - wish there were better cues on breathing.  Good workout, but didn't really make me break a sweat.  Would like more of a challenge.",1176508800,,203,4.583333333333333
2461946,3,B000CEXF8I,"I really like Ellen Barett, so I picked this one up on a whim.  I was a little disappointed with the lack of variety, but overall it was good in that it stretched me out -  especially the beginning warrior sequence which is my favorite.  If you are an advanced exerciser/and or pilates guru this might be lacking for you. I can't really see how this will give a ""super slim-down"" result, but I will use this on  light days when I am too sore to perform other, more difficult cardio/weight routines.",1176336000,4,498,4.380434782608695
2461957,5,B000CEXF8I,This is absolutly the best workout DVD I have purchased to date.  It's not impossible to keep up with and after having been doing it at least 3 times a week for about 2 months now I still feel it every time.  That's a sure sign that it's still working for me!!!,1176249600,,261,4.0
2461958,5,B000CEXF8I,"I like the Crunch series as they get down to business without a lot of explanation.  I have bought some of the Windsor Pilates DVD's and they are always trying to push the lastest gimmick (circle, rubber band) and not just strictly workout.  Maybe I have been getting the wrong ones but all the Crunch series with Ellen are good.  You will feel it the next day- no pain, no gain!",1175644800,2,379,4.309859154929577
2461959,5,B000CEXF8I,"The best thing about this workout is Ellen Barrett. I have two of her other workouts, and love her. She is perky enough to make the workout fun, but not overly so. She doesn't get old after watching it a few times.

The workout itself is great. It feels almost like dancing at times because of the flow of the moves. What I love about yoga and pilates is that you can always get a harder workout by focusing more on your core as you are doing it. So you can get a great workout the first time and the 50th time you do it.",1175472000,2,521,3.961904761904762
2461960,5,B000CEXF8I,"I am some what new to yoga, I am in pretty good shape already and somewhat flexible so it is hard for me to find videos I like and are challenging and not boring. This video moved fast and although it was somewhat challenging, not too much, perfect for me I didn't want it to end. I felt taller and like I was stretched and more tone. I liked this a lot. I highly recommend it.",1174953600,3,377,3.973684210526316
2461961,5,B000CEXF8I,"I've never done excercise videos. But I am saving money at the gym and I really like gettign home to my dog after work and then working out. I am a pretty fit lady and this video is a great workout. I love the incorporation of yoga and pilates. I've probably done the video 10 times in  3 weeks and my clothes are fitting much better. The lady is positive but not annoying and I like the music. I was surprised I could accomplish a good work out in 40 minutes, but it's working. i will certainly check out others in this series!",1174521600,2,528,4.12621359223301
2461962,5,B000CEXF8I,"I am a YogaFit Instructor and Pilates Instructor.  I decided to try this workout because I like the Crunch series and I like classes or workouts that ""fuse"" Yoga and Pilates.  I do not like using the word ""basic"" when describing a workout because I think some people mistake ""basic"" for ""easy.""  Even though the workout is ""basic,"" I found it quite challenging. My philosphy is that your workout is what YOU make it.  You can choose to make this workout ""easy"" OR you can choose to make it a challenge.  Either way, it is a GREAT workout with some new and different moves.  I LOVE Ellen and her teaching style.  Whether you are a beginner or a Yoga ""Pro,"" you will not be disappointed with this video.  It is quickly becoming one of my favorites!!!",1174262400,6,748,4.448529411764706

2461987,5,B000CEXF8I,"I love this video.  The cues and moves are easy to follow.  I work up a sweat, but somehow does not feel like I am working that hard.  I feel a new muscle in my body every time I use it.  The only (minimal) criticism I have is that proper breathing is not always stated and sometimes I am not sure when to inhale/exhale - a prior yoga instructor always stated how important proper breathing is.  This video is perfect for the beginner/

intermediate.  This DVD is my current favorite - I make time to do it and find it even relaxing, despite the fact I am working up a sweat.  I really like it.",1173139200,,594,4.104347826086957

2461989,2,B000CEXF8I,"I don't like it.  It felt like watching an 80's workout video; the movements are too aerobic and the outfits are annoying.  I much prefer real Yoga and Pilates workouts, where you can hold a pose and focus on breathing.",1172275200,4,219,4.45
2461990,5,B000CEXF8I,I am a beginner and not in the best shape and this CD is perfect for me. Has some different moves not on my other CDs so made it interesting and it is the perfect pace. I have another Crunch CD with Ellen but that has more cardio stuff so I like this one better.,1171584000,2,262,3.7818181818181817
2461991,5,B000CEXF8I,great dvd. relaxing yet effective. Great instructor with a nice teaching style- calm and direct.  Music is relaxing.  Exercises are challenging but not straining.  You see results relatively quickly.,1171411200,2,199,5.793103448275862
2461992,5,B000CEXF8I,"I haven't watched this video but I have studied both Pilates and Yoga in thorough, slow-paced instructor led classes where the history of each respective practice was explained and each pose was explained in detail.

Yoga and Pilates are fundamentally different when it comes to breathing and alignment and in some ways 'opposite'.  My Pilates instructor had to reteach me breathing technique for the class, because it is different from what I learned in my Yoga classes.  She even laughed at the idea of hybrid Pilates-Yoga classes, because she said you can't really combine the two.

I'm sure this work-out can give you a good workout, but both discplines require a good mastery of fundamentals down to posture and how you hold your muscles when standing or lying down (especially abdominal muscles) -- if this video doesn't explain clearly exactly how to do that for each of its ""hybrid"" moves, you cannot get the maximum benefit from each move and may not even be working the muscle in the right way.

(I'm just giving this a '5' rating to balance this word of caution and because it would be unfair to rate it poorly without watching the DVD)",1170892800,2,1147,4.7727272727272725
2461993,2,B000CEXF8I,I guess I expected something else from this DVD. The exercise was for someone who has practiced this type of pilates before. It is fast paced and no time to pick up whats really going on. Not for novices......or older persons.,1170806400,13,226,4.536585365853658

Ellen Barrett does a great job intstructing the moves so you don't constantly need to look at the screen. I also like the fact that she does Yoga in the beginning to warm you up. I highly recommend this video for first timers and also people who have done pilates before!,1169596800,3,427,4.095238095238095

Her cues are very easy to follow & she's not annoying at all (like a lot of the exercise dvd girls that i roll my eyes at!).

This workout is also great because you get out of it what you put into it...so it's good for all fitness levels.

2462027,5,B000CEXF8I,"I literally just walked off my mat from doing this program and wanted to give my freshest impression of it.

I've been doing Yoga daily for about 10 years and I added Pilates to my daily routine a little over a year ago. The combination is incredible (I also weight train intensely twice a week).

I've also got well over 100 Yoga and Pilates programs so I'm very familiar with much of what is out there.

I've liked some of the crunch programs I've done in the past and I also enjoy doing fusions of Pilates and Yoga (I have programs like Yogilates and several of the New Method programs). I thought this one looked very interesting so I picked it up when I saw it.

To start with, Ellen Barrett really impressed me as a teacher. She gives clear yet concise instruction and keeps the flow moving throughout the program. I found her to be motivating without being too peppy (I can't stand overly peppy and cheerleader like instructors).

The program is really cool, it starts with flowing yoga sequences where she takes several Yoga poses and links them together into a flow. This creates a lot of heat in the body and allows you to warm up and move deeper into the poses as you go through the sequences. I always like to start by playing my first edge in any Yoga pose and then move deeper into it gradually. With these sequences I liked the fact that I could do this same sort of deepening but with each sequence as a whole so by the time I was into the final sequence I was really deeply into the poses.

The entire program is done using this effective sequencing in both the Yoga and the Pilates inspired sections. I say Pilates inspired because while she uses Pilates exercises this is not traditional Pilates. For me that's a good thing because I already have many programs that follow the more ""classic"" sequence so having programs that use the Pilates techniques in creative ways is something I find really helpful. This is great on two counts; first because it keeps things interesting from a mental standpoint, and second because your body doesn't adapt to a limited range of exercises (and overtrain those areas).

This program was almost exactly 40 minutes long and is broken down into four sections on the menu (two Yoga sections and two Pilates sections). You can also input the exact location if you need to (by inputing for ex: 1:05 for one minute and 5 seconds etc.),

So, if you are looking for a flowing combination of Yoga and Pilates that will challenge your body in ways different than other programs I highly recommend this one. Also, for people who might love a flowing approach to yoga but aren't into doing Sun Salutes (I must admit that I personally like Sun Salutes but I also like variations in my practice as well), this program will probably be ideal for you. It's not an over the top, butt kicking type program that will leave you exhausted, but it's certainly challenging in what I'd consider an intermediate sense. I'm in really good condition and I still broke a bit of a sweat doing this.

 Also this program has a designated modifier who you can follow throughout the program until you are able to build up to doing  the full expression of the exercises.",1161993600,115,3191,4.532173913043478
2462028,5,B000CEXF8I,"I'm giving this 5 stars, although it should be said this is the first workout video I've tried so I don't really have anything to compare it to.  But I bought it because I had tried pilates briefly awhile ago and enjoyed it, and I wanted to strenghten my whole body.  I have 3 kids and only a spare 20 minutes or so out of a whole day; I've been using this dvd at night when they'e asleep.  I really really like it.  The moves aren't easy, but they are doable and I can feel it working.  The next day, even after the first time I did it, I feel like I'm standing straighter.

It's also very relaxing...as I said I do it at night and while it pumps me up and energizes me while I'm doing it, when I'm done my mind feels clearer and my body feels good and it puts me at ease.  I really like it!!!",1161043200,10,794,3.925
2462029,5,B000CEXF8I,"This is a really fun workout for me. I tend to go for Pilates/Yoga blends and I thought this one was unique with the additional cardio component. I definitely ""felt"" the exercises, some were challenging (strength-wise for me) but I could still follow along without difficulty. I thought the instructor was perky and easy to follow. I think this workout would appeal to a wide audience.",1160438400,7,385,4.848484848484849
2462030,4,B000CEXF8I,"I enjoyed this workout.  I love yoga for its awakening of the muscles and concentrated breathing, but it was my first experience with pilates.  I enjoyed the mix because it gave my abs and triceps a workout, you get to reward your muscles w/nice stretches, and the 40 minutes went by quickly.  I feel the pilates and yoga were blended well in this workout - great for beginner in either.",1158192000,11,387,4.5
2462031,5,B000CEXF8I,"when i read the length of this dvd was 42 min i thought i might die before it was over. great for beginers, went by quickly and shows modifications to the more difficult movements that my body will just not do.",1157760000,6,210,4.146341463414634
2462042,5,B000CEXF8I,I already have the pick your spot dvd by Ellen and I love it. This one really takes it up a notch. I felt great afterwards and I found out that I am really weak in my upper body so I am excited that this workout might change that. I did find the yoga segment a bit repetitive but at least it wasn't too challenging for me since this is my first experience with yoga. As usual there is someone doing a less challenging version of some of the exercises which I took advantage of a couple of times. I like having something to work toward. Someone who is in great shape will probably like this workout on days when they want to do a light workout but for people like me who are trying to get in shape it is awesome and will really challenge you without being too difficult.,1157241600,12,769,4.099337748344371
2462043,5,B000CEXF8I,"I just started taking a pilates class at my gym in July, going twice a week.  I wanted to practice pilates at home, but I didn't think I could find a workout on DVD as fun, yet effective, as my class.  Well, this is it!

I'm not a huge fan of yoga because I find it too slow for me.  On this DVD, Ellen makes it enjoyable.  She keeps the yoga poses moving at a good pace so I don't have time to get bored.  Then, it seamlessly transitions to pilates matwork, which also goes at a good pace.

With a lot of other DVDs, I find myself looking at the clock.  Not this one!  This was a fast 40 minutes!

Although it's helpful if you are familiar with yoga and pilates poses, Ellen's cueing is so good, a beginner wouldn't have any trouble following.",1155772800,20,744,4.068965517241379

My thighs are much more defined and my stomach (the bane of my existence) is flatter.  After just a week and a half.

I hate exercise, but seeing results this quickly keeps me motivated.  I actually look forward to this dvd.  I even get up at six a.m. to do this dvd before work and if you knew my night owl, cranky morning self, you would know that is a serious testament to how great this dvd is.

I have ordered Ellen Barrett's other pilates/crunch dvds.  She's not annoyingly perky.  Her assistants look like normal people.",1154995200,45,693,4.359375

2462047,3,B000CEXF8I,"After reading all the good reviews I decided to add this DVD to my collection. I already have Crunch Pick your Spot Pilates with Ellen and it is one of my favorite videos.

This workout was not very challenging. I didn't enjoy the yoga section because it moved too quickly and was very repetitive. The pilates section was o.k., but I did not find any of the moves difficult. This is definitely a workout for beginners. I didn't enjoy the music- it was like they tried to make Asian music upbeat, and it wasn't motivating nor relaxing.

Because the moves were very reptitive, I found this to be a long 40 minutes.",1154649600,7,612,4.455357142857143

As someone who has done yoga and pilates before, I thought it was on the easy side, especially the first half of the video.  And that makes it feel long at 40 minutes.  My solution has been to warm up myself on my mat with a few sun salutations, stretches, etc. and then do the last twenty minutes of the video, which ends up being a good workout.",1154390400,3,517,4.14

The only time you get to really relax is when you're done! I'm in pretty good shape, and a few of these moves (like the not-so-aptly named Little Piece of Heaven) had my muscles shaking! Ellen Barrett makes it all look deceptively easy. I use this when I want a strength building routine but am not in the mood to pick up dumbbells.",1150243200,7,463,4.395348837209302

2462076,5,B000CEXF8I,"This was my first yoga & pilates DVD workout, and I was hesitant whether it may be difficult to follow along, but then also whether it will be challenging enough once I become experienced with it.

I must say this has easily become one of my favorite DVDs!  And it is one I actually don't mind doing even on my lazy days...those days when you feel you should do some exercise but wanting to put it off.  (actually, it's become the perfect DVD to do on those days)

It is fun workout that can easily be picked up by beginners but still be a good, comfortable workout for someone more experienced. I feel stretched, relaxed, and properly exercised after doing this DVD.  It makes me feel like I have done some really good exercises for my body, which in turn makes me feel happy.

I was also pleased to notice that my core/abs area has become tighter after using this DVD after two weeks.  Something I haven't been able to do with a lot of other work outs.  One simple reason is that this is such a fun, and engaging DVD to do that it has encouraged me to use it often; thus, the motivation turning into visible results for me.",1147737600,18,1125,4.298578199052133

This video is definitely a keeper for days when I am not up to the challenge of a more advanced workout or after a good run/cardio session.  I am also looking forward to checking out other DVDs by Ellen Barrett based on the many reviewers who seem to love her style.",1144454400,17,531,4.510416666666667
2462079,5,B000CEXF8I,"I was pleasantly surprised with this workout, it is invigorating and relaxing but you will feel it working too.  Ellen Barrett, who is known for her Crunch and more recently Self magazine workouts is back in what I feel is her best workout ever.  Ellen is joined by 7 other ladies including Marni who shows some beginner modifications.

This 40 minute workout begins with some power breathing and standing backbends before moving into the first yoga series.  You will move into warrior 2 and pulse while in that position, therefore called the ""warrior pulse"", then you will move into side angle pose, then reverse warrior, and sweep your arms around and down to the center for some power breaths up before repeating on the other side.  This series is repeated a few more times, but with less warrior pulses.  More power breathing finishes this series.

The next series is somewhat similar, but you will begin in triangle pose this time.  Once in triangle, you will move back to warrior 2 but twist to the front and raise the arms up, hold them before lowering and twisting back to the front.  This is repeated several times on the same side before doing on the other side.  Next is the zigzag, Ellen's favorite move which targets the core.  You will face front and extended your arms from side to side then scoop down and do the same thing.  Then you will repeat the triangle series on each side again followed by the zigzag once more.  Then you will move to triangle once more before moving to plank pose then do some knee cross crunches.  Then you will stretch out first in downward facing dog, then childs pose.

The next series is the willow series which is much harder than it looks.  You will begin in childs pose, then lift up your torso up  while trying not to lift your rear from your heels.  I need to work on this one.  You repeat this several times before moving to the dolphin float (elbow plank).  The willow/dolphin series is then repeated several more times.  Then you will do a variation of extended cat pose, you extend one arm and the opposite leg, and lift and lower each one, then you will extend them out to the side slightly and do the same, then you will alternate front and side.  This is then repeated on the opposite arm/leg before stretching out in childs pose.

The next series starts on your front, you will first do leg beats, then a back extension, then a little piece of heaven which is a pushup on the knees, hinging back, then returning to start which your elbows are held inward.  This really targets the triceps and I was definitely feeling it after a while.  This series is repeated several times before finishing out with pilates leg circles.  Then you will lie on your side for some more leg work.  You will lift the bottom leg off the floor, then lift and lower the top leg, then you will lift and lower the bottom leg.  The option of taking the supporting arm is there to make it tougher, side passe alternating the leg to the front and back follows.  Then you will do the side bend twist, then the knee drop progression.  Here you are propped up on your elbows and you will drop knees to each side while extending the top leg,  then you have the option of straightening both legs while lowering to each side.  Then you do a brief stretch before repeating the lying side leg series and side bend twist on the other side and do some more knee drops.

To finish out the workout, you will do some ab work.  You will roll down and up halfway before going into modified teasers, then you will roll halfways down again while pulling the elbows together.  Then you will move into the single leg stretch, some more oblique work where you drop your knees to each side and climb an imaginary rope and finally the ballerina criss cross.  Then you will do some brief stretching and breathing.

While I am extremely active and aim to do weights, cardio, yoga and pilates each 3 times weekly, I do have to force it somedays.  This is one workout that I truly look forward to doing.  It is exhilarating and I feel great afterwards.  It isn't hard, some experienced in yoga/pilates might feel it is way too easy but it is perfect for me and I have a blast doing it.  This is Ellen at her best, she does an excellent job leading this workout.  5+ stars for this one.",1143936000,269,4291,4.448717948717949

It has nice background music which is just that....in the background. No loud or heavy beats that can be distracting and disruptive. The entire workout is very smooth and fluid from one movement to the next. I still need to do some modified movements, however I thoroughly enjoyed the routine.
