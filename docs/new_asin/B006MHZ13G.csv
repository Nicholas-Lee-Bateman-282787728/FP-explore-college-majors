So I was pleasantly surprised when the second part became available.

5004808,5,B006MHZ13G,"I am a dedicated fan of Daniel's singing but I have to say just when I thought a CD/DVD of his was the best, another one of his is released and that is the best also.
Nashville was extremely excellent as it was more like a show rather then a concert.  His humor reigns supreme.  Best of all it is all clean fun. A wonderful man and aim to purchase all of his CD's as well as all of his DVD's.",1337990400,2,392,3.8271604938271606
