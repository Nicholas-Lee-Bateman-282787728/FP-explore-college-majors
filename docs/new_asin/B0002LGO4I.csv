8028942,3,B0002LGO4I,"This low-key and low-budget little Cold War thriller (whose UK title, ESCAPE ROUTE, makes a lot more sense than this randomly-chosen one for US release) is diverting and entertaining enough if nothing spectacular.  By far its most valuable asset is the always luminous and endearing Sally Grey, whose final film this was, in a leading role.

Unfortunately her co-star here is George Raft, who delivers another of his trademark wooden performances.  The rest of the cast is made up of solid British character actors who deliver in their accustomed way. At 78 minutes, the movie doesn't wear out its welcome, and holds our attention fairly well through various mild surprises that keep the plot moving along.

All in all, nothing particularly remarkable here, but certainly well worth a look, especially as a chance of seeing the elegant Sally Gray one last time on the big screen. A few interesting London locations, including the London Bridge and the Tate Gallery, add an evocative touch that help to give the film some visual personality. And for some reason composer Hans May seems to be quoting the ""Song of the Volga Boatmen"" constantly in his score, which is an strategy that certainly hasn't aged well.",1505520000,,1209,4.97029702970297
8028943,3,B0002LGO4I,"I have been running the rack on the old black and white film noir genre the past several years mainly grabbing stuff from the Netflix archives (running the rack a term learned in my pool hall days when I hung around with corner boys who hung around pool halls although I was never much of a player, mainly a hanger-on and bettor, a bettor against a guy like Red Radley who lost me more money than I could shake a stick at-not realizing until much later that Red was cheating, was threating murder and mayhem against whoever he was playing against and he was big enough to enforce his edicts). At this point since I have been pretty steady in my attempts to see plenty of them I have moved down, or been forced by Hollywoods tastes to move down, the A classics like The Postman Always Rings Twice,  The Big Sleep, Out Of The Past and a few others and hit the B-films of late. Maybe B minus as is the case here in this police procedural out of London town Ill Get You starring old time 1930s heavy gangster George Raft.

This time out Raft plays an undercover FBI guy working on an international kidnapping case in London. And if you are talking about FBI guys working on anything in the 1940s and 1950s then you are talking about something related to the red menace, the Cold War, the Soviet Union and its nefarious plans for world conquest (according to the Washington propaganda campaign and what did we know about such plans and if there such plans when it came right down to it) as the Cold War got icier as the decade after World War II went on. Here Raft, posing as a scientist after giving the Brits the slip entering London finally winds up working along with a fetching woman British agent (okay, okay, MI5) played by Sally Gray to find out what the hell happened to a few nuclear scientists who were abducted and sent behind the Iron Curtain. Sent there obviously to be grilled, and maybe more, by the bad guys who wanted to get the latest up-to-date information on whatever level the Americans had worked out making nuclear weapons even more deadly.

Naturally the hook here has to be a sinister Mister Blank, Grand in the story line but everybody over the age of twelve knows that is strictly a front, an alias, who is manipulating the action behind the scenes and trying to keep the Anglo-American attempts to get the scientists back from succeeding. The whole story line is run as a bunch of cover plays and ploys with one side leading the other on wild goose chases until Raft pulls the hammer down. Naturally as well when there is a female agent involved whether here on in a James Bond vehicle there is romance in the air. Despite that slight diversion Raft and the boys grab the bad guys and all is well for a while-until the next turn in the Cold War battles. So you can see now why this one is a strictly B effort, not more. Got it.",1452038400,2,2851,4.375471698113207

8028945,5,B0002LGO4I,We started watching Soviet Multfilm while living in Kazakhstan.  This was one of our favorites.  We brought some DVDs back and our 4 year old loves wolf and rabbit in Ny Pogodi.  Language is not barrier.  It is good natured and much less violent than road runner and Wile E. Coyote.  Heartily recommend!,1311638400,,303,4.6415094339622645
8028946,5,B0002LGO4I,"My husband grew up in Moscow but has been in the US for 7 years. He fondly remembers this cartoon - well, the first 10 episodes. He turns his nose up at the last 10 episodes as an inferior tack-on effort. However, our 3-year-old loves them all. One of her fist Russian phrases has been ""Nu Zeis, Pogodi!, usually accompanied with crazy laughing and chases.

My favorite part of these cartoon is a) the wolf's pink shirt and b) the fantastic music. Sometimes they sneak in some American Jazz like ""Everything Goes"". Remember, these cartoons were made in the Soviet Union!

Anyhow, we love these cartoons - which is good because my pee wee wants to watch them all the time!",1190678400,6,671,4.537190082644628
8028947,5,B0002LGO4I,"This is the best Russian cartoon! I watched it being a small girl (I grew up in Russia) and can assure you that absolutely EVERY child loves it. My husband (also from Russia) hated cartoons in his childhood - only Nu, Pogodi was the exception. I was surprised to know that it is also sold here. I will buy this for my child, when he grows up.",1116806400,3,342,4.119402985074627
8028948,5,B0002LGO4I,"I recently saw an episode of ""Nu, Pogodi!"" on a local multicultural TV station, & found it to be hilarious, ironic, & enigmatic.  This resulted in my buying the complete collection on DVD.  Many people attempt to compare this to the ""Road Runner/Coyote"" series or to ""Tom & Jerry.""  While the basic premise is the same (hungry Wolf is chasing Hare), this series is far different from what Americans are accustomed.  Wolf usually is smoking a cigarette (which usually adds to his situation), has a beer belly, & even consumes alcohol to the point of intoxication; this is all shown right on screen.  In addition, the characters ""thumb their nose"" at each other!!

  Another factor which differentiates ""Nu, Pogodi!"" from other cartoons, is that the background music isn't orchestrated for the cartoon series, but rather popular Russian/contemporary songs are incorporated. You will hear popular music from the time that particular cartoon was made (18 were made from 1969--1993).  Wolf will be chasing Hare in an episode from the late 1970s, while a disco tune is playing; another episode from 1984 contains techno/pop music from that particular time period.  The visual effects are set to the music, which allows for some comical moments!

  Most cartoons (or any story, for that matter) follow the view of the protagonist (hero) & how that character resorts to escape or rescue.  ""Nu, Pogodi!,"" however, follows it from the view of the antagonist, Wolf, & allows himself to show how inept he is at obtaining his goal.  Whereas the Coyote is presumed to be sober while chasing the Road Runner, Wolf has displayed otherwise, & his intoxication only adds to his ineptitude.

  As an American who does not know any Russian, I did not find the language barrier to be any problem; there is very little dialogue uttered in ""Nu, Pogodi!""  All one needs to know to understand this series are the following:  ""Zayats"" means ""Hare"", ""Volk"" means ""Wolf,"" & ""Nu, Pogodi"" means ""Just you wait, I'll get you,"" in Russian.  This makes up for over 90% of the dialogue in the series.

  I would rate this a 10 out of 10; it is a definite must-see!",1116720000,16,2130,4.836565096952908
