8087543,5,B000BJS4US,"Elementality Vol. 1 proved that not only is Element Skateboards a huge company with lots of money, they also proved that they were committed to skateboarding in every from. Whether it is vert skateboarding, street skating, park boarding, or illegal move sets down flights of stairs, Element's team of talented young bucks and veterans throw down one of the best skateboarding videos both visually and technically and it's here at one low price.

8087544,5,B000BJS4US,"If you're a fan of skateboarding, especially street, this is the DVD for you. It features some of the best skaters performing awesome tricks. The movie features: Bam Margera, Chris Senn, Colt Cannon, Jake Rupp, Jeremy Wray, Mike Vallely, Tosh Townend, Vanessa Torres, Brent Atchley, & Nyjah Huston. The DVD also features: Ahbi Huston, Collin Provost, Dallas Rockvam, Erick Preis, Levi Brown, Tony Tave, Tyler Bledsoe, and the rest of the Element family. Plus the DVD contains bonus footage. The only downside is the movie only features street style, no vert. Which is fine with me, I'm a big fan of street. Parents please note: there is some strong language.",1196812800,7,658,4.990909090909091
