2750388,4,B000MV9OB8,"This movie is very interesting to watch, and the characters bring a nice glimpse into the changed world, although some tend to sometimes sound as if they were in a Sociology discussion group in a coffee shop.  The makers of this film appear to have done their homework in that there is a good attention to detail of how the characters would probably be living after such an event.  It is worth watching for those, like myself, who are fans of the post-apocalyptic genre. Another minor drawback is that a small few of the characters, especially those who were existing in a less civilized manner, appeared to be very clean-shaven and not too far removed from a barber shop. Overall the film is definitely worth a watch.",1203552000,2,718,4.645669291338582
2750389,5,B000MV9OB8,This is a great movie.  The premise sounds a bit pretentious and cheesey but the filmakers somehow never seem to over-do the stories.  They attempt to tell the stories of a few of the 186 survivors left in San Francisco.  The film brings up more than a few philsophical debates that the survivors encounter.  Look for a great acting turn from Myth Buster's Adam Savage.  Most of the acting is great and the filmakers convey a sense of desolation in SF with out a huge CG budget.  Probably one of the best movies I have purchased from Amazon.  I hope that the writer/director/cinematography team can get a project with a much bigger budget.,1202428800,4,639,4.601769911504425
2750390,5,B000MV9OB8,"I've waited over five years for this film.  Soon as I heard the premise and execution, I was good to go.  Unfortunately, it stayed years in DVD-limbo for the same reason most good things do: money.

This was a small, independent film - so small, in fact, I was able to get in touch with one of the creators, Joshua Atesh (no, not Calum Grant!) and get myself placed on his ""list"" of people who'd been chafing for a copy of their very own for an eternity.

All that trouble, and I found out about this film's DVD release as a seeming-afterthought, and through a back channel... very sad!

Great flick.  Even after five years of anticipation, I still wasn't let down.  Perhaps the best post-apocalyptic flick I've seen on DVD... imagine that!  No stars, no special effects to speak of, no on-location segments or mentionable production values, yet it was better than most of the ""blockbuster"" schlock that comes out around summertime each year.

I mean, the only thing we really got here was talking-face interviews inside nondescript homes, or outside in anonymous woods.  Yet somehow, all of it was far more interesting in premise and execution than many of those jillion-dollar Hollywood movies.

Hope these guys get something more than just their money back for all their troubles.  I'd like to see more stuff from them along this vein, if such is possible.",1191715200,17,1359,4.736170212765957

2750409,2,B000MV9OB8,"Ever Since the World ended is a fictional, video-diary/documentary set in post-apocalyptic San Francisco.  A plague, (possibly of government origin), diminished massively the population, leaving this particular city with a mere 186 people.  The film peruses a handful of this collective through interviews and group conversations.

Reading the description of this film, I had hoped that I'd catch some underrated gem chronicling the interior of human psych following a devastation of this magnitude.  Most stories in the Aftermath genre typically focus on thrashing horrors and unbelievably escalated confrontations.  I'm tired of these scenarios, so I turned my attention to this project hoping the doc-angle would add some much needed, basic realism.  I wanted to see inner workings in the inevitable government that will bloom during any drastic shift in the human condition.  I wanted to see reproduction, society, and a technological renaissance.  I wanted accuracy.

Moral of this story: be careful what you wish for.

The film started off strongly enough, I'll give it that.  I sat shotgun with a Fat Tire warming in hand while my host introduced his intentions and a small group of surrounding characters.  It was during this intro that I fell in love with the movie because it was discovered that Adam Savage rode out the Apocalypse.  Adam Savage.  Who wouldn't want him on board a sinking ship?  Nobody, that's who.

Sadly though, my admiration proved a dying flame that even Adam couldn't re-kindle.

While the acting wasn't bad, I only rarely found myself submerged in the performances.  Something inhibited me from doing so consistently, and it took me some time to sort it out, but I think the problem was that the actors seemed so similar.  I realize that they're all from the same city and have spent a considerable amount of time together, but that's not the problem.  To me, it seemed the actors were friends before the filming began and weren't completely capable of breaking their mold.

I'll avoid rambling through specifics from here out and just advise that the movie never really left the ground for me.  Again, I ended up getting what I asked for, but discovered that that's not what I needed.  Peaks were present, but they felt forced and anti-climactic.  The goings-on of the community left me decidedly bored as did their small, unfortunate pilgrimage outside the city limits.

In essence, this was just another day in dead San Francisco and it left me wanting.

2750410,4,B000MV9OB8,"I liked this movie.  That by itself won't make anybody get the DVD but I did.  This is the side that you don't see.  Most of the time you see action movies about the climactic ending, or maybe roving bands of marauders attacking villages (there is a very brief bit of that) but this movie focuses more on how the rest of scociety deals with the aftermath.  In this cas the culpret wasn't a roving band (I'm not going to say what it was).  The rest of the people - not the main charactors in the movies. but the other people, what happens to them?  This movie focuses on them, but it does it in a way that it makes it seem like it really happened.  This movie is made to be a homemade documentwry filmed by future reporters who want to make a name for themselves by explaining what happened, interviewing people, and saying what life is like now.

2750411,3,B000MV9OB8,"The Bottom Line:

I respect the effort made by this movie's filmmakers to show what life in San Francisco would look like after a catastrophe, but no matter how well-meaning the effort the fact remains that Ever Since the World Ended is mainly just dull, with few compelling shots or storylines; look elsewhere for post-apocalyptic drama.

2750412,2,B000MV9OB8,"The premise of EVER SINCE THE WORLD ENDED is one that has been done many times before, but here directors Cal and Josh try something new that works for the first half but quickly bogs down in areas that frankly grate on a viewer's intelligence.  A virus of near total lethality has swept the United States, killing hundreds of millions.  We see none of this.  What we do see are the after effects some twelve years later.  Cal and Josh are residents of San Francisco and they travel the city with a makeshift video camera, interviewing as many of the 186 survivors as they can. Their brief interviews form the film proper, which like a Shakesperean play within a play, is always two steps removed from the external world of the viewer. I have no problem with this concept, which in its own way is quite daring.  The major issues that do not ring true even in a cinematic sense are the ones that create the false reality of the filmmakers who seem determined to shrink the pre-plague years of a liberal leftist pot smoking San Francisco into a montage of scenes that suggest that the hip, ultra-liberal lifestyle of youngish ex-stock traders is quite sufficient to form the basis of a viable society that is as neatly ordered as if nothing of consequence has happened at all.  Except for a few thrown in scenes of some seriously disturbed individuals, everyone concerned is cultured, fit, well nourished and dressed, and possessed of a mental equilibrium that is rock solid. Nowhere does there exist any Mad Max motorcycle thugs wreaking havoc on the few peaceful remnants of society. Nowhere is there even a hint of the ravages of time that a lack of human beings will impact on the environment.  The recent hit television cable show LIFE WITHOUT PEOPLE creates a far different world minus people.  Within days, the environment would suffer noticeable degradation.  Certainly after twelve years, a major city like San Francisco would evidence an explosion of animals roaming the streets, collapsing buildings, and mosses and vines infiltrating ubiquitously.  Yet, this San Francisco is as well maintained as if an invisible army of garbage collectors and architects were working discretely overtime to maintain the clean lifetstyle that liberal urbanites insist is the inevitable accompaniment of those who demand latte coffees as they drive to the polls to vote for Barack Obama. There is even an incredulous scene in which an ultra-liberal female is debating the merits of having a child minus the presence of the biological father. In short, EVER SINCE THE WORKD ENDED is a left wing fantasy that defends a lifestyle that even God would find both politically correct and eminently desirable. For viewers who wish a dash of reality in their fantasies, this film is an insult to survivalists everywhere.",1244764800,3,2804,4.89662447257384
2750413,1,B000MV9OB8,"Simply put, this movie is simple.  It's a faux-documentary of several post-apocalyptic San Franciscans who meander through their attempt to make sense of it all on film.

First and foremost, there is nearly no description of how the world got to its current horrid state.  The only thing known is that there was a massive plague of some kind.  There's no development, no description, and there is no reasoning why the people still alive weren't affected, which is especially irritating when considering the fact that one of the initial reviews is with someone in the medical field.  It's an absolute must to really becoming interested in this sort of movie.

The rest of the movie is somewhat difficult to stomach.  The whole environment is pristine, without as much as a pile of flaming trash in site.  It's a wonder how all the people in the movie aren't dying of dehydration and starvation considering all the work they must put in to clean up the entire city.  I guess it's easy considering all 186 people left in S.F. are all knowledgeable, educated, and actively in search of some sort of Zen-like existence amongst their fellow survivors.  Except of course that one arsonist who was added as a weak attempt at interpersonal tension or a decayed sense of a community's attempts of policing their own.  And those people in the woods, whatever they're all about other than getting away from everyone else.

I have no problem with the positive outlook on life, the attempted utopia in a dystopian future, but there has to be some believability to be enticing.  The social gatherings and educational opportunities are completely unrealistic if amongst the last couple hundred survivors.  If you want to watch a post-apocalyptic movie shot with some documentary footage, check out Romero's Diary of the Dead; it's far more interesting, infinitely more well done, and more believable...even with the zombies.",1238889600,2,1908,4.977917981072555

2750416,1,B000MV9OB8,"WARNING!!! THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW!!!!

SPOILERS WITHIN

Sorry, but this movie is just not that great. I know it's a low budget film, but that doesn't excuse the poor plot, unbelievable scenarios, and massive plot holes. the basic plot: a plague wipes out the world's population, leaving 186 people left in San Francisco. one issue: we hear so much about this plague, yet learn nothing about it. we aren't told a single bit about it's origin, initial outbreak, symptoms, how it spread across the world, or how it's spread (it's assumed it's not airborne, given the lack of face masks, but that's all we get). we don't know why some people were apparently immune (and why the majority of those people are white, fairly educated people. I counted 2 minorities in this whole film) or whether it affected the environment (there are mentions of wild dogs, and we see birds and fish). overall, we get zero information about this plague, other than the fact that it's deadly. even if this movie was less about a killer plague and more about the people that survive it, this info could have been worked in somehow, espcially since we get several interviews w/ a doctor

also lacking is info about the current situation. we hear over and over how there's only 186 people left in S.F. but get no info about the outside world. we don't learn how the rest of the country and world survive, what sort of political structure is left, or even if the crisis is really over (we're just left to assume the plague magically disappeared from the face of the Earth). also, everything is very, very clean. it's a bit unbelievable to see the streets completely devoid of trash, bodies, burned cars, scavengers, or other signs of an apocalypse. given everyone's nonchalant view on life (a girl just laughs off the fact she came across a dead body, people are holding dinner parties, making art, playing musical instruments, and learning about Da Vinci, as opposed to learning how to survive in this new world) and the fact everyone is so clean and well fed, you wouldn't even know the end of the world had occurred.

plot wise, the movie isn't strong. there is a supposed crazy guy living in the town and the people are trying to decide what to do w/ him (they get the grand idea of banishing him, but seem surprised he came back, as if 186 people could block off the entire city). the film makers trek out to the middle of nowhere for some absurd reason (they set out to talk to people, but go to a desolate area). people in this movie are very quick to kill each other, despite the fact the human race is nearly extinct. and the ending is just pure idiocy.

the concept was marvelous, but the movie just wasn't all that great, even considering this was a low budget film. compare this film to other post-apocalyptic films involving disease and plague (The Stand, 28 Days Later, etc) and you'll see how this film pales in comparison. this is a very amateurish film that should have never seen the light of day outside the film department of a university",1212451200,20,3031,4.595194085027726
2750417,1,B000MV9OB8,"OK, I'll admit up front that I stopped watching this movie before it concluded.  I stopped right about the point where the young woman announced she had decided she wanted to ""parent"" a child by herself and had publicly approached some male visitor to assist in her impregnation.  That happened right after a lovely older woman wearing nail polish and lots of jewelry -- holding court in her perfectly-appointed hilltop home where she hosted communal ""book club"" type gatherings -- announced sternly that there would be ""no guns at the table.""  (This sent a young woman who sported a sidearm scurrying off apologetically to remove her weapon before taking tea.)

To imagine that any of these scenarios would play out in any form after a plague has reduced the San Francisco area to a population of 186 is frankly absurd.  To imagine that only those who are artists and free-thinkers would survive is absurd.  Where are the hooligans?  Where are the high school dropouts?  Where are the minorities?  (Was that chic Aleut-looking guy the only non-white who made it?)  To imagine that a room-full of 20-somethings would listen raptly, jaws open, as the attire of French courtesans is explained to them by a volunteer teacher -- that, too, is absurd.

What were these people eating?  Canned food left over at the Piggly Wiggly after 12 years?  Who was cutting their perfect lawns?  Where were they getting water?  (There was a stab made at explaining that, but not a convincing one.)  Where were the dogs and cats?  The rotting cars?  The rust, the dirt, the blight?  We were given to understand that there was only one ""not nice"" guy alive, and he was basically only made that way by some weird type of PTSD from being a ""care-giver"" during the plague.

I realize science fiction does have the obvious fictional component.  But it really does need to have some semblance of reality to work.

Save your money.  This movie is just plain stupid.",1207440000,48,1939,4.774096385542169
8172903,1,B000MV9OB8,"Giving a one-star review normally seems an exercise in excess, but sometimes people need to be warned.

I love post-apocalyptic movies.  I have an incredibly tolerance for even poorly constructed ones.

That being said, this was so unbelievably awful I would have tried to get my money back if I had not found it more satisfying to throw the DVD in the garbage. Normally I would go, ""Eh, not my thing,"" and give it away or donate it to the library, but I didn't want to feel morally responsible for exposing anyone to this.

The entire movie is a cliche of what an out of touch urbanite thinks an apocalypse might be like:

Everyone is clean and well-manicured.  Nobody seems to spend any time, you know, acquiring food, or rebuilding anything.  Everybody is chill, mellow - there is no strife. The city is an idyllic fantasyland that reminds me of the Eloi in the first movie adaptation of H.G. Wells' ""Time Machine"", waiting to be eaten for food, an end that there, as here, seems the appropriate conclusion to a sub-species of humanity that bears more resemblance to domesticated meat cattle than human beings.

Batteries all mysteriously work, enough that someone is making a documentary.  Clean water and food magically appear at every table.  I kept seriously expecting there to be a ""The Village"" or ""Soylent Green"" twist where it turns out at the end that everyone is being bred for livestock by a post-apocalyptic band of cannibalistic marauders.

The thing is, I don't demand that a post-apocalyptic story be brutal.  Neither ""Earth Abides"" nor ""Alas, Babylon"" had much in the way of gangs or marauders or even violence, and both came across as very moving, very human stories.  The problem with ""Ever Since the World Ended"" is not that it isn't violent, it's that it's completely nonsensical.

Despite title, despite cover graphic, despite back blurb, and despite the claims coming out of the characters mouths - this is not a post-apocalyptic story, but the meandering daydream of a utopian idealist who would be dead inside a week if the events chronicled in the story had actually happen.",1426723200,,2102,4.835195530726257

8172905,3,B000MV9OB8,"The majority of post apocalyptic movies focus on violence in one form or another usually involving zombies or some type of crazed mutants.  This is a very simple film about people like most of us who have survived after an epidemic has decimated the human population.  The focus is on a small community in San Francisco of about 200 survivors and the situations they face as well as the pain of their loss.  I think it has some good points such as how the group has to deal with a potentially dangerous mentally unstable member of their society.  It also shows how the children who didn't know or don't remember the old world have a different view of life and the world.  It's not a groundbreaking film but it's not garbage as so many reviewers seem to have dubbed it.  It reminds me of a student film, very earnest and heartfelt yet never really grabbing you.  If you are a fan of Post Apocalyptic films, I'd recommend giving it a try. It's definitely better than a lot of the zombie trash out there at the moment.",1364428800,,1015,4.424731182795699
8172906,4,B000MV9OB8,"I liked this movie a lot.  I think it is about the most realistic post-apocalyptic film I have seen (The Road might be more realistic, but definitely much darker).

SPOILER ALERT:
The movie is set 12 years after a plague has decimated mankind. Two ex-film makers decide to document some the 189 people still surviving in the San Francisco Bay area.  The variety of people and personalities is very well done.

There is no real government, although a group of people does get together to discuss issues.  Mainly they discuss the problem of a man who suffers from a form of PTSD because as a paramedic he was exposed to the horrors of the plague more than most people.  He burned some houses and was banished from the community under threat of death but he returned and there is confusion on how he should be dealt with.

There are teens who don't really remember the plague and feel disconnected with the adults who are so focused on the world that used to be.  There is a group of women sharing a large house where they care for children and maintain a sense of family.  There are two men who spend their days surfing and fishing. One character is determined to create a museum to document the plague but no one has any interest in helping him. Adam Savage plays ""Adam"" who is the technology guy who can fix things.  We see him working on several projects , the two film makers even discuss the batteries he provided for their cameras.

A number of reviewers have taken exception with several plot elements that they find unlikely or implausible but I found the movie very well made overall.  There were a few details I did not agree with but since I didn't write or direct the movie I can let them slide. I found this to be a very enjoyable film.",1356220800,,1747,4.4420062695924765
8172907,4,B000MV9OB8,"I liked this film (and no, I'm not from the west coast,) but I wholly understand why many people don't.  You have to appriciate it as a low-budget film -- of course there weren't vast expanses of derelict cars on weed-strewn cracked interstate highways or collapsed sky-scrapers and power lines like Hollywood has conditioned us to expect from standard Post-Apocalyptic fare.  The film-makers in real life didn't have the means or the money, and the film-makers in the world of the film (who, in the world of the film, also had very limited means) set out to tell a human story that would interest the remaining survivors, not a scenic one.  Some of the people complain that this film is nothing but boring talking heads.  True, but it is a mockumentary of sorts, and many documentaries are mostly talking heads.  Whether or not they're compelling talking heads is a side-effect of the small population size.  If you're making a documentary film and you have billions of people to choose from, you usually limit yourself to universally compelling subjects who sound well-spoken on camera.  If you were trying to make a documentary film, and you had only around two-hundred people randomly chosen from what used to pass for the general population to interview, you'd have very few born orators to select from.  Adam Savage saves this film, in my opinion; he's the most interesting to listen to if you like thinking about the sorts of things that a very small number of people would have to focus on if they were intent on ensuring their survival.  For instance, he made a great point about firearm choice (I can't remember if it's in the deleted scenes or the main film) that a lot of post-apocalyptic films seem to miss.  A lot of the rest of the people interviewed range from moderate to boring -- as they would in real life, if you were only able to choose interview subjects from the small group that survived the cataclysm.  Some people have wondered why only a certain kind of person with a certain mindset or outlook seemed to survive.  Two reasons, both of which were suggested in the film without being explained outright.  First, the film-makers didn't attempt to interview absolutely everyone who survived the plague -- many of the survivors weren't civil enough to approach, including the ones who shot and killed one of the main players in the woods at the end of the film.  The ones who were safe enough to film were the ones who lived in the city, where they would be expected to have developed a reletively common outlook on life.  Second, more than 186 people survived -- likely many more!  The 186 were the ones who were known to be alive; once again, the ones who weren't living in the city and weren't safe to approach for any reason would have been omitted from that count.  Some people question the premise of this film, saying that it's unrealistic (or even biased) that only people from San Francisco survived.  Actually, if the plague was the real killer that it's depicted as, it's likely that only a small number of individuals in a particular seemingly random niche would have made it, and San Francisco is just as random as any other dot on the map.  It's not unreasonable to expect them to socially bottleneck.  Think of an antimicrobial soap that has the label claim of killing 99.99% of household germs.  If that 0.01% of household germs that do survive the wave of mutilation survived due to some unknown factor in their environment or their genetics or both, you would expect them to be small in number, geographically isolated, and sharing in certain traits.  In this case, the miniscule percent of organisms that survived certain death were geographically from the bay area, were small in number, and shared some kind of biochemical or behavioral trait unknown to them that resulted in their staying alive where everyone else is believed to have perished (again, if it's safe to assume that the number 186 isn't accurate, there could be pocket communities of survivors here and there across the globe, each one isolated by failure of the infrastructure and thus convinced that they were the only ones who made it.)  The woman in the film who is acting as the medical doctor says that, if a biologist or geneticist had been among the survivors, they could have had a shot at answering questions like that.  None did.  The premise is sound, or at least no more far-fetched than most post-apocalyptic films out there.  Some people complain that nothing happens in this film, and that everyone is too serene.  Well, these people act like survivors who have had lots of time to get used to the idea of being practically extinct.  It's not drama to them any more, so they don't depict it dramatically for the camera, either.  Again, what else would you expect, if this really did happen?

So I don't think it's too outlandish to appriciate, and I think that many of the things that are often identified as holes or flaws can be explained within the context of the story that these film-makers are telling.  If you can't handle films that are just talk, or if liberals give you the willies, then this ain't gonna be your cup o' tea.  But if you like mockumentaries, you don't mind talking heads, and you like post-apocalyptic speculative fiction, this film is worth a look.  Hopefully, though, you'll get a better disc than mine.  The video and audio are horribly out of sync throughout the film, and it annoys the heck out of me.  If it was over-dubbed in a different language, I could tolerate it.  When someone is speaking to you in your own tongue, and their lips don't ever match the sounds that they're making, it's grating.

Interesting little film.  Not big, not exciting, but thought-provoking and minimalist, neither of which is a complaint.  But the sound track quality has me displeased every time I watch.",1335571200,,5846,4.727810650887574
8172908,3,B000MV9OB8,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc, nor any extras.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

'Ever Since the World Ended' seems nearly equally spaced between its high and low points.  As a faux-documentary that looks back a decade later on a plague that decimated the world, the film primarily moves through interviews of the remaining 186 people alive in the city of San Francisco.  Though not succinctly stated, these people are on the cusp of leaving behind the old world and creating a new one, with the reasonable idea that some still cling to the familiar, and others are facing the difficult realities ahead of them.  This is a fascinating, thought-provoking concept, with boundless room for exploration.  The problem is that the people who have survived in this area, with few exceptions, all closely resemble the stereotype of San Franciscans as dreamy, elitist artists or liberal unitarians sitting around a campfire singing Kumbayah.  Surely people like that exist, but I don't buy that San Franscisco is so completely overwhelmed with this type that if a random sample of 186 people were selected, this demographic would be the only one from which to draw.

But, perhaps I'm wrong.  Maybe, for this particular area of the country, the film is more or less accurate in depicting the makeup of the survivors.  If so, I wouldn't bet much on them lasting another ten years - not without serious changes to their outlook.  One of the films strong points is amply illustrating how, with the exception of one man, none of the people who were accustomed to the old world were able to let it go, preferring to retain as much of the trappings of the society that spawned them as possible.  By feeding of the remains of civilization, they are able to continue the illusion of that society, and to avoid looking at what happens when the carcass of San Franscisco is no longer able to support them.

Because the film has such a lop-sided representation of the survivor's cultural outlook, I suspect a large part of whether or not it appeals to someone is how much they identify with the people onscreen.  White, upscale, liberally tolerant folks with a relaxed attitude toward the world might really dig it.  Few others are represented, so it seems as though there would be less attraction for them.  In the end, the faux-documentarians themselves are unable to draw any conclusions from the footage they've taken, and instead leave it to speak for itself.  As a projection of what the world might look like given the film's parameters, it does make some interesting observations, and also provokes speculation in the viewer.  Yet ultimately what the footage suggested to me was that this particular group were unsuited for long-term survival due to their utter inability to discard the conventions of the past when dealing with the challenges of (their) present.  If I thought that was the filmmaker's objective, I would have given it higher marks - but I don't.  Rather I think they were enamored with the illusion that something viable could still come out of this society, that it would still be able to remake the world in the manner they would like for it to be.  Maybe - but it seems to me that the words and actions of a young teen, too young to remember the way things were, indicate better that their new world would be predicated along more primal lines.  That means that 'Ever Since the World Ended' is a bit of a misnomer - twelve years after the plague, the world is still ending, kept alive by the memories of those who won't let it go.",1315267200,,3670,4.728414442700157
8172909,1,B000MV9OB8,"It's poorly filmed, poorly acted and full of pseudo-intellectual garbage.

The movie is filmed as a documentary, and as a documentary it's just plain bad. The whole thing is put together haphazardly. There's at least five separate storylines, none of which are very interesting, and are cut together in a weird way. There's no focus to the movie whatsoever. There's no beginning, middle or ending. It looks and feels like something a high school kid would put together for film class. The ""post apocalyptic"" scenes consist of being either out in the forest, or closeups of people in their nice clean house with the lights off and a candle burning.

The actors are obviously ad-libbing for most of the movie. You can see the internal dialog reflected in their eyes. They're not acting, they're sitting there talking. They're not present in the movie at all. Every character is clean, well groomed and coiffed.

Apparently, the only people to survive in San Francisco are artists, teachers, film makers, sculptors, hippies and one emotionally disturbed ex-fireman. The society they've created for themselves has no purpose and no direction. Everyone seems to be only looking out for themselves, and they don't even do that very well. How they've lived on their own for 12 years after the world ended is mind boggling.

The only redeeming quality in this movie is the engineer played by Adam Savage. His character seems to be the only one taking the end of the world seriously. He talks about what it is like and what is needed to survive in the world they currently live in. His character has plans for the future and realizes that eventually everyone will have to move out of the city and get back to living off the land and making simple tools in order to live. Most of the deleted scenes on the DVD are him talking about life in a post-apocalyptic world, and are just about the only thing worth watching on the entire DVD.",1311292800,5,1923,4.748502994011976
8172910,4,B000MV9OB8,"I just watched this film and enjoyed it. It is the story of a documentary made by the survivors of a flu pandemic that has wiped out most of the worlds population, leaving small sparse groups of survivors. I do agree that some of it is far fetched, and there are a few holes here and there in the story. But what it does well is convey the feel of living in this situation. IE a VERY few people have survived, and they have whats left of the world to themselves. I almost felt like they were living in a far better world than the one that had fallen. Nature was recovering. There was peace and solitude for the people who did survive. Yes, there were a few crazies and it was still dangerous. But then you see them fishing, and imagine the fresh air and the quiet. This is a post apocalyptic world you might not mind having a go in. I do have a feeling that the end of the world would lean more towards this image than mad Max, because the really violent people would kill each other off within a few years and the peaceful more civilized groups with community skills would have more staying power. I do agree that it was a prettier picture than reality would be, ie no burned cars, dead bodies everywhere, etc. But all in all a decent attempt to get into the minds of the survivors. A worthy effort. I have to recommend it.",1303603200,,1324,4.216535433070866
8172911,4,B000MV9OB8,"Its funny how people find plot holes and such in this as if major blockbuster End-O-World flicks don't. For heaven's sake, its movie. It is obvious that this was a low-budget shoot and I doubt it could have been done better even with money. I liked the movie because it was off the cliche radar. The part I enjoyed the most were the youth in the film that had little memory of the old world and wanted no part of the apocalyptic nostalgia of their elders. If the world did go down, I would rather see these folks survive than the Road Warriors. I would LOVE to see a sequel of the survivors in, say, Alabama or somewhere else in the redneck south. There would surely be more gunplay :)",1303257600,,685,4.276923076923077
8172912,4,B000MV9OB8,"the opening credits turned me off a bit but the rest of teh story carries you along quite nicely.  I was realy surprised with how engaging the format was and how entertaining it was too.  yes Adam Savage is in it but he's notthe ""star"" so don't watch it just for that.  watch it becasue its an engaing and intersting movie that provides a good think.",1299369600,,350,4.2727272727272725
