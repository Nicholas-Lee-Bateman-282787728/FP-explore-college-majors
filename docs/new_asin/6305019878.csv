947317,2,6305019878,"My friends and I love to watch great B-movies, but this is just a BAD B-movie.  I fell asleep halfway through it, if that gives you any idea.  The premise is decent, but G.I. Bro, supposedly the main character, is barely in it!  It was disappointing. Don't bother...check out Dolemite or Soul Vengeance instead!",975974400,7,311,4.722222222222222
947411,1,6305019878,"Quentin Tarantino has long been criticized for the violent nature of his movies. Tarantino has stood by his films and sometimes just avoided questions targeted at the amount of violence they feature. He denies any suggestion that his violent movies are connected to violence in real life. Despite this he has been acclaimed as protesting against ""real life"" gun violence.

It is time to consider his legacy in a somewhat more realistic light: Tarantino is for better or worse an accomplished director, which in Hollywood means that he plays the game according to Hollywood rules while grossing huge profits. Hollywood rules do not require films to be ""realistic"" or true to life, historically correct or logical and as ""Inglorious Bastards"" proves, no subject is sacred, even the Holocaust can be completely distorted and made into sensationalized, fun. Many in American audiences may consider this film some sort of legitimate satirisation of the Nazi's but they laugh at Tarantino's ""jokes"" at the expense of understanding the tragedy of the history that is the subject of this movie, and its historical repercussions today.

For one thing, the movie exploits a cheap trick by portraying its violence as legitimate revenge of its Jewish heroine. The entire Nazi top, including Hitler are burned to death in a cinema, ending the 2nd world war. Wishful thinking? Methinks that there is a subliminal message buried in this film that few viewers will be aware of.

The ""bastards"" are in fact a scavenged group of military men, majority Jewish, who are turned into a commando group charged with attacking and hideously mutilating German soldiers (all of whom are referred to as Nazi's and therefor legitimate targets for the groups tortures, which are necessarily to remain secret owing to the fact that they violate the Geneva conventions). Thus, what the movie is really providing is a legitimation of the USA's contemporary wholesale dismissal of the UN convention on human rights and the Geneva convention. These conventions were mostly upheld by the Germans and the Allies with respect to enemy combatants during the war, albeit not with respect to civilian populations or ""undesirables"".

In addition, very few cases of Jews ""taking revenge"" occurred during the war. Jewish resistance occurred mainly in self-defence and was, on the whole, legitimised by their weakness and vulnerability. Tarantino's legitimation of the inhumanity the ""bastards"" perpetrate in the movie thus proposes that Jews have a legitimate right to ""take revenge"" and the underlying message is thus that the State of Israel has a right to abandon all conventions on human rights to maintain its position because the ""others"" were or are ""evil"". However, Jewish ethics and Israeli laws do not sanction wanton murder or torture. Eichmann, it will be recalled, was given a fair trial in Jerusalem, not scalped. Those who think he ought to have been scalped rather than put on trial seem to think that our best interests are best served by meting our justice directly, without intervention of the law. Tarantino's bastards are a lynch mob. They don't care about justice or humanity, and they are therefore no better than the Nazis. Indeed, in some instances they seem worse. Is this a subliminal hint of Tarantino's that all is not well with the state of the union? I think not. It is more symptomatic of a profound loss of values that this piece of trash should ever be shown to audiences at all.",1454284800,,3469,5.059440559440559

This is the equivalent of filming six year olds playing ""guns"" with a shaky, headache inducing, 1985 video camera. Nothing feels WW2. Nothing feels professional. NOTHING. This is unwatchable.

947442,4,6305019878,"This original 1978 international blockbuster film INGLORIOUS BASTARDS by Director Enzo G. Castellare, in color on a single-disc DVD, finally made it's way to the shores of America. Yes! And, it presents the viewing audience with jam packed, epic intrigue and explosive action that is set during the World War II, era. Actors - Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson star, within this adventurous depiction of a group of ""criminals"" who escaped from a prison camp..., with the intention of crossing over into neutral territory by way of the Swiss Border. Although initially involved with the War, they decided that they wanted no parts of this seemingly unending War, and they certainly didn't want to lose their lives because of it. So, creative measures were incorporated for their escape and ultimate destination = freedom. But, as fate would have it, they are caught and have no other alternative but to ""volunteer"" for what amounts to be a suicide mission. But nonetheless, the will to survive and the obtaining of personal liberty despite their forecast for a sacrificial mission, called for some unified, drastic, measures. After all, desperate times call for desperate measures, right?! Especially since, their dangerous mission in a little French town, was right smack in the heart of Nazi occupied territory. So, what happens? Well..., what doesn't happen?! This fully restored and engaging DVD comes complete with double-crossing saboteurs and violence, a plenty. So why, if the escapee's who were headed towards the border of Switzerland in search of personal freedom and far away from any involvement in the War, suddenly... volunteer for a seemingly, futile mission? Look's like you'll just have to watch the movie and see for yourself. And, just to show you that I do have a heart, I'll even give you a clue: It will be worth your viewing time. Particularly, if you're a movie war buff! So, pop the popcorn, honker down in your favorite seat and be entertained by this engaging film. Nina Kish",1414972800,,1999,5.042296072507553

947446,1,6305019878,"Inglorious Bastards is awful. The sophomoric screenplay includes stopping the action to display the names of characters with arrows pointing to the actors in bold, seemingly humorous fonts. The plot centers around an American military leader, Lt. Aldo Raine, (Brad Pitt) who orders 8 Jewish soldiers to mutilate and kill Nazis. Pitt's dreadful performance as an obnoxious laughing, head bopping cowboy is an insult to the discipline and dignity of the American military. One of the Jewish soldiers laughs, jerks himself around, & shouts ""WHOO-HOO, OUT OF THE PARK!"" after killing & dismembering a Nazi, which is an insult to the educated people he is supposed to represent, & not acceptable as a person of that time. The conclusion re-writes the ending of World War ll & the death of Adolf Hitler. A few performance were good and the anti-Nazi theme was appropriate but it was still one of the worst movies ever made.",1393718400,,917,4.961038961038961
947447,2,6305019878,"First off, I'm not one of those posters who enjoy giving bad reviews. I'm not a movie snob, either. Most of the time if I don't enjoy a movie or book, I realize that my experience isn't necessarily representative of most people. Maybe I failed to see the point. But sometimes a lemon is just a lemon. I bought this movie because my favorite movie director, Quentin Tarantino, spoke so highly of it. The production values are awful, but that in itself isn't a deal breaker. Story is the most important element of any good movie, and here the plot was aided with a decent storyline. Escaped military convicts accidentally kill U.S. soldiers, disguised as German soldiers, and decide to take on the deceased's mission. Obvious ""Dirty Dozen"" rip off. Which I could forgive if it was half as good as that movie, but it doesn't even come close, I'm afraid. I give it two stars, because it at least helped inspire Tarantino's World War 2 masterpiece by the same name. I truly believe the disparity you see here in reviews is due to the fact that most of the people who love it, remember it fondly from their youth. They can recall watching it at their local ""grindhouse"" theater as a kid. The events of that night so strong and nostalgic in their memory banks that it's clouded their judgement of the movie. Everybody has a movie or two like that. For me, the scariest movie I saw as a kid was ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"". Recently, I bought that '70's classic, and believe me, despite the nostalgia it invokes, it doesn't hold up well at all. I think if Tarantino could separate the nostalgia he feels about ""The Inglorious Bastards"", he'd see it for the truly ""Bad"" movie that it is.",1390867200,,1680,4.511475409836065

947485,4,6305019878,"This film is basically about a group of escaped convicts that ventures throughout the countryside while encountering assorted adventures.  They meet a variety of people, move from one place to the next, and there's loads of action and violence.  Perhaps it's because of the films budget, but you only see people fall down without any blood or gun shot wounds during the majority of these battles. This makes it seem earlier on that the entire film might be bloodless, but towards the end of the film it gets bloodier in some parts with some gun shot hits being shown. The films pace is very fast, and there's some nudity here when the group encounters a bunch of fully nude skinny dipping women; there's some brief and difficult to see flashes of full frontal nudity but not much.  The film certainly delivers in terms of action and violence, but another thing I really liked about this film is the beautiful countryside scenery.  With all the fields, forests, lakes, streams, waterfalls, and some old fashioned stone structures, the film is pleasing to look at and this helps to keep the viewer watching.  In terms of entertainment, I personally thought it was much better than Tarintino's remake, but that's just my opinion. It's well directed, and the clear purpose of this film is simply to entertain.

The DVD quality is great. They did a excellent job with this transfer. I also got my DVD for a really cheap price, so it was definitely worth it.",1358035200,2,1452,4.742063492063492

Never had this issue with another film, have had some more low volume than others, but never one remotely as bad as this transfer is. I cannot suggest it to anyone, save your money.

The film itself was decent, I thought it was another war movie I had seen as a kid, but was mistaken. I had never seen it until the other night.

947491,4,6305019878,"A World War II adventure set somewhere in France, The Inglorious Bastards (1978) is solidly entertaining affair, where a group of escaped prisoners become involved in a top secret commando mission.  Directed by Enzo Castelari, the movie is an Italian production with an international cast, and features some nicely executed combat scenes, creative cinematography, and interesting European locations.

A group of inmate soldiers is being transported, when their convoy is attacked by a German fighter.  Led by Lieutenant Robert Yeager (Bo Swenson) and Private Fred Canfield (Fred Williamson), the surviving prisoners take command, and escape from captivity, heading off in a truck bound for Switzerland.  The rest of the ""Bastards"" are Tony (Peter Hooten), Berle (Jackie Basehart), and Nick (Michael Pergolani).  They eventually wind up on foot, where after taking refuge in a barn, they discover a German soldier named Sachs (Raimund Harmstorf) who is willing to help them to escape.  Travelling through the French countryside, the group encounters various German forces, and has to fight for their lives several times.  Sachs is killed in a skirmish, where a group of Germans is wiped out.

Soon after, the escapees fall into the hands of a group of Partisans.  They discover that the German soldiers they just killed, were actually Allied soldiers in disguise.  These men, were to have collaborated with the partisans on a top secret mission.  American Colonel Charles Thomas Buckner (Ian Bannen) parachutes in to lead the mission, and is furious when discovers that his trained commando team is dead, and his only option is a bunch of misfits and deserters.

It's been a fun ride so far, but things ramp up to a new level as the complicated mission goes into operation.  This is where the Bastards really shine, as the various pieces fall nicely into place.  Buckner and Yeager impersonate German scientists in order to try and steal a vital V2 rocket component being transported on a train guarded by the German army.  Meanwhile the partisans are setting up to take over a railroad station, and blow up a bridge.  What follows is a number of nicely executed action scenes, large scale battle sequences, and action aboard the train, that all build up to a dramatic conclusion.

Like many war tales, it isn't necessary to have a lot of depth regarding motivation or character development.  Since the Bastards killed the men who were to go on the mission, it seems fair that they take their place.  Being an Italian production, many of the actors are dubbed, which kind of colors some of the performances.  Bo Swenson (Walking Tall) is rather low key as Yeager, a capable leader that can kill when necessary.  Being black, slightly restricts what Fred Williamson's character Canfield can do, but ""the Hammer"" definitely makes his presence known, and executes his role with style and a brash attitude.  Williamson, Swenson, and most of the cast, perform many of their own stunts.  Dubbing hides his British accent, and Ian Bannen may not quite look the part as an American General, but his performance still comes across as quite solid.  The only thing that seems out of place, is the instant romance between Tony, and Nicole (Debra Berger), a member of the partisans.  This is the only tenderness, in a bittersweet tale.

Director Enzo Castelari's commentary track provides lots of background information regarding the production of the film, and the cast.  Quentin Tarentino, a huge fan of the film, is featured in an extensive conversation with Castelari, almost gushing with glee at times.  This discussion is quite informative, as at the time Tarentino's planned remake (The Inglorious Bastereds) was still in its infancy.  In the three disc edition, Disc 2 contains two featurettes, including Train Kept-A-Rollin', an extensive 75 minute retrospective with lots of meaty information, and interviews with Casterlari, Hopkins, Williamson, and various cast and crew members.  Disc 3 contains four musical selections from the film's soundtrack.

The Inglorious Basterds (2009), has increased interest in the original film that impressed and inspired Quentin Tarentino so much.  This is a good thing, as Enzo Caselari's film is well deserving of a wider audience.  The Inglorious Bastards is a tough straight ahead war adventure, with some unassuming and unlikely heroes, who do what needs to be done without any fanfare.  ""Inglorious"" they may be, but they operate with a sense of style, bravely accepting their fate and fighting hard till the end.",1295395200,2,4550,5.137228260869565
947492,3,6305019878,"Disclaimer: I watched this film as a streaming rental, and cannot comment on the quality of the item offered on this product page.  My review primarily concerns the entertainment value of the film only.

There is no mystery why this film has gotten the new release treatment that it has (not only a new DVD but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-3-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00140PKEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a 3-Disc Special Edition</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-ray/dp/B0026LYMFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-ray</a>&nbsp;version as well).  Quentin Tarentino's film of almost the same name undoubtedly spurred interest in this Italian effort from 1978 (it certainly worked for me), but potential viewers need to know from the beginning that other than the similarity in name and the WWII setting, there is nothing else common to the two films.  While the review format here on Amazon does not provide a sufficient venue to talk about all the things that are wrong with Tarentino's film, fortunately it works well enough to cover the pros and cons of this Enzo G. Castellari effort, which is true enough to itself, and deserves to be judged in that respect.

The film's tagline should give most film buffs a pretty good idea of what to look for - ""Whatever the Dirty Dozen did, they do it dirtier!""  In other words, look for a group of misfits who are cast off from the regular army to be put in a situation where they are the best fit for a secret mission.  That makes 'The Dirty Dozen' the film to compare 'IB' with, and if you liked 'DD', then you'll probably find some redeeming features in this film, though I think there are some significant idealistic differences behind the film.  While I wouldn't consider 'DD' to be any sort of seminal work, it does seem like part of a trend that prepared the way for American films of the seventies with it's refusal to abide by conventional characterization, it's bleak outcome, and it's oblique chiding of older film's adherence to notions of fair play.  'IB', on the other hand, comes at the war from a decidedly more passive outlook - all but one of these fatherless sons are more victim than perp, and there is a definite ""why can't we all just get along"" vibe shot through the story.  Both films though, are extremely different in tone and message than 2009's remake.  Whatever Mr. Tarentino found in this version of 'IB' that influenced his film, it probably had more to do with the film he saw in his head rather than what was actually up on the screen.

Bo Svenson plays Bo Svenson, and Fred Williamson plays Fred Williamson as they lead a ragtag group of Army prisoners who first escape from the MP's and head for Switzerland's neutral territory, and then accidentally get caught up with French partisans and their raid on a new guidance system for the Germany's V-2 rocket.  Along with an atypically long-haired pack-rat, a coward, and a mobbed-up Chicago bigot, the plot toes a fairly stereotypical line as the five escapees first argue among themselves and then are forced to become a team for the sake of survival.  Despite some plot holes - especially concerning the love interest between the Chicago boy and the partisan nurse, and which may have been the victim of some over zealous editor - this film isn't bad, but it isn't a classic either, not even a minor one.  3.5 stars.

While the new release and the blu-ray version are understandable (marketing) - even taking into consideration the film's status in the War film genus - what puzzles is me is the three-disc release.  Scanning over the extras (which I freely admit I haven't seen), I don't see anything interesting enough to warrant that kind of hyperkinetic effort, or that justifies the added expense - the most appealing extra, the commentary by Enzo Castellari, is already available on the single disc edition.  It also seems a bit fishy to me that no other extras other than the trailer could fit on this single DVD.  Essentially, it looks like a money grab, with just enough extras added to make the second disc necessary (the third disc looks like a CD of an unused score).  This isn't the first time I've noticed studios indulging in this kind of packaging exploitation - better to rent first and decide the level of enthusiasm you have for the film.  If you are as swept away with it as the blurbs portray Tarentino to be, then you may wish there was a four-disc release.  Otherwise the less expensive version may have all the 'Bastardi Senza Gloria' that anyone really needs.  End rant.",1291680000,2,4628,4.989596879063719
947493,3,6305019878,"This is a campy, B- WW2 film.  For some reason misfit commando flicks were popular back in the late 60s and 70s.  Probably because of the Vietnam syndrome in the US. Films like this were popular because they knocked the establishment, and made fun of the army.  The premise borders on the absurd.  Misfits who become Commandos and manage to do everything is fantasy pure and simple.  There is a certain rough charm to this film in a crude sort of way.  The directing is almost pure Italian Spagetti War film!  Every dying soldier seems to jump up in the air.  Bodies fly like an areial ballet at one point.  Funny, but pure nonsense!

Those who want just a silly action flick with attitude will likely enjoy this epic.  We even have an angry Black man to cap it all off who kills dozens of nasty white Germans.  The Germans are all SS bad guys stock character types.  They seem just keystone cops to get machined gunned down over and over.  Everyone has machine pistols that fire unlimited rounds and never run out of ammo!

Unlike some films of this genre at least some allies get killed and the slaughter is not all one sided.  Production value is what you would expect from a war film made in this time and with limited budget. Its largely indifferent in that you have US tanks and half-tracks for German vehicles with a few notable exceptions.

If you like casual violence with B acting and not too much gore then go for it.  I can't believe Hollywood actually remade this clunker!",1272931200,3,1485,4.477611940298507
947494,5,6305019878,"Yeah, I loved the movie but a few weeks later I find myself going through revisionist feelings about it, and they aren't altogether happy ones.  I keep thinking that, like many of the other reviewers, I ultimately found the Basterds sections of the movie to be the worst, and really they should have been the best.  The fantastic idea is impressive, but it just wasn't carried out with even a fraction of the cleverness or panache Robert Aldrich displayed in The Dirty Dozen.  The audience gets cheated out of watching so many scenes (scenes which might have developed a bit more character)--like, how are they smuggled behind enemy lines and how on earth do the Basterds maintain the considerable artillery they seem to have at every turn?  Even the detail of the baseball bats gets to seem like a problem, instead of an inspired invention.  I know it's a fantasy, but in the great scheme of the movie--and it is a great movie--the individual Basterds, our heroes really--all melt into a featureless glob of stew.

Well, there's Brad Pitt.  Did I miss something or was Brad supposed to be Jewish in the movie?  If not, how did he become the head of the squadron?  Do Jews need a Gentile to lead them into this righteous field of battle?  Maybe these questions (such as, how did he get that scar around his neck) get answered in the sequel or prequel (if there is one).  The film betrays, perhaps, a lack of proper funding, and feels stretched paperthin.  There are maybe three or four sets, and almost no action.  Give Tarantino even a quarter of the budget of Saving Private Ryan, and he might come up something fit for the big screen next time.

In the meantime there's plenty to savor about the movie.  Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger are splendid, each of them with one big scene that will be referred to when it comes time to write their obituaries.  I didn't buy the great secret plan that Laurent's character hatches, nor is she quite talented enough to make it believable.  But during the movie's first half she's unmatchable, and has a scene when Christoph Waltz leaves the room for a minute that ranks high among movie breakdown scenes.  Diane Kruger is so interesting to watch on the screen every moment she's on that you don't realize till later you never found out why she does the things she does.

You don't ask for consistency from Tarantino, you just ask for, and are rewarded with, incisive writing and breathless tension.  Maybe his ""arcs"" are a little bit crazy...  The Jewhunter's longterm goal, once revealed, is such a 360 degree turn we feel he's just pulled it out of his arsch....  But hey, I don't begrudge him that Oscar.

947547,4,6305019878,"My rating:  3.5 out of 5

Premise
*A mixed group of American warfighters are being transported as prisoners in the middle of WWII France.  They are ambushed by enemies and are set free.  They then spend the rest of their time trying to reach Switzerland, fighting bad guys and running dangerous missions for the French resistance as they go along.

The Good Things
*Video quality is good.  It is very colorful, detailed, and clean.
*Includes a number of documentaries, featurettes, trailers, and a bonus CD soundtrack.
*The movie has a great deal of action (although much of it is quite over-the-top).
*The photography is interesting.  Some of it is jittery and rough, but other shots are solid.  There are also some cool slow-motion scenes.
*Exterior locations are excellent.  It looks like they used real European settings (like the scene in the castle).
*The story is not bad.  It is well-paced and easy to follow.
*The characters are not bad.  They aren't too deep or complex, but they are interesting to watch.  Their acting may be seen as ridiculously over-the-top, but I'd say it's good.
*Music is not bad; it's very boisterous and upbeat.

The Bad Things
*Well, you can either call this a really bad movie or a really good cult/B-movie.  See below for details.
*Not for young kids; it's unrated, but contains a scene with nudity (nude girls with guns, nonetheless), some violence, and some swearing.

The Questionable Things
*The sound quality is okay; I think it had too many parts where some volume was too low and other parts were too high.  Most of the dialogue can still be understood.
*The dialogue is loaded with lines that are...well...ridiculous! If you don't mind, it may not bother you much.  I found myself laughing at most of it.
*The plot is riddled with historical inaccuracies.  There were some nice touches, like having the guys going after the V2 rocket.  But other details, like the types of uniforms, the types of vehicles, and the weapons, are way off.  The portrayal of the French resistance is way off.  Having a colonel parachuting into the woods is way off.  You do not want to see this for any history lessons; you'll either hate it or love the absurdity.
*Even though there are a lot of neat action scenes, many of them are choreographed in a really ridiculous over-the-top fashion.  Everybody shoots their guns by wildly waving them around.  Everybody who is shot falls over like they're slipping on banana peels.  One guy manages to kill people with a slingshot.  Nobody ever runs out of ammo.  Bad guys appear out of nowhere in endless hoardes.  Once again, you'll either hate it, or love the absurdity.
*Some things that happen in the story makes you wonder ""why did they do that?""
*The romance story for this whole movie is kind-of contrived.  Once again, you'll either hate it, or love the absurdity.
*Some of the sets and props look cheap.  Some special effects are obvious models or matte paintings.  If you're expecting a high production value, this may dissapoint you.
*Some parts seem to be derrived from other things.  Aside from ""The Dirty Dozen,"" I thought of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" as I watched the ending.  My parents thought one scene resembled the old ""Mission Impossible"" series (gotta love it how the guy stops a self-destruct device by shoving a pencil in the gears).

I expected a rough, gritty, bloody war epic...but I guess that's what Tarantino's new film will be like.  This original version is very over-the-top, with lots of absurd dialogue, action, and events that could never really happen in real life.  I wound up laughing at the whole thing, because in nearly every scene, there was something absurd.  I thought it was fun because of this, but if you're like my parents, you might be disgusted instead.  Rent it to see what you think.",1236988800,5,3806,4.780674846625767
947548,3,6305019878,"it's hard to say what I think of this film.  It's, in some ways, a brilliant war film that deserves recognition, while it can simultaneously make you shudder. it has a clever plot but then you have dialogue like ""hey, those are our flyboys!"" (impersonates an airplane while making a machine gun noise); there are some great effects and sets that are made good use of, but you can see the ropes pulling men from an explosion more clearly than you can see the strings in an Ed Wood film; you have naked german women firing machine guns at retreating American troops, and then you have the fact that this scene only lasts a couple of seconds (this is first time that an Italian movie has skimpped out in this category, let alone not completely over do it. It should have been at least a few minutes long, if not for the sex appeal then for the pure hilariouty of it.)
It's like a movie that's so bad that it's good, but at the same time is actually good.  And, like many films of this sort, it's main source of entertainment comes from it's cleverness that simply oozes from it's different aspects including plot and filmwork.
The only major problem is that I had expected it to actually go on for about two hours or so until it ended. I would've given it four stars if it were only longer (especially certain *clear throat* scenes).",1233964800,16,1330,4.424489795918367
947549,3,6305019878,"Thanks to the odd impressive matte shot and a skilful marshalling of its limited resources, Enzo Castellari's Inglorious Bastards doesn't look cheap even if the same extras keep on getting killed in every action scene, but despite Quentin Tarantino's slavish devotion it's more Garrison's Guerrillas than the Dirty Half-Dozen. Castellari's heroes are a standard issue group of American military prisoners: black marketer (Michael Pergolani), would-be mobster (Peter Hooten), coward (Jackie Basehart), proud black man who got tired of taking s*** (Fred Williamson), mildly sympathetic disillusioned German deserter to avoid offending the lucrative German market (Raimund Harmstorf) and the obligatory cocky but heroic one who got busted for using his fighter plane as a taxi for dates across the English Channel in his downtime (Bo Svenson). Naturally their plan to make a break for the border when they're waylaid en route to the stockade by some Nazi planes naturally ends up with them embarking on a mission vital to the success of the war (admittedly only after inadvertently killing some of their own side), but then this is a film that exists purely to do only what's expected of it rather than offer any unwelcome surprise. Sure, there's the odd spin on some of the old favorites, but there aren't nearly enough naked women with machine guns to truly lift it above the formulaic.

Dialogue isn't exactly sparkling - ""All Americans are mongrels... and your women are whores!"" - and half the cast are dubbed anyway (Ian Bannen's Scottish tones are replaced by an American actor and Hooten by what sounds like John Dall), but the film does its job even if it's more supporting feature than main event. Castellari is the best kind of hack, one with a good eye for framing and who knows how to shoot action (although the sight of one German soldier being lifted up, Peter Pan-style, on a visible wire in an explosion is worthy of one of the sight gags in Top Secret! It's a minor film and one it's best not to expect too much from, but there a lot worse exploitation films out there.

The three disc US Region 1 NTSC DVD comes with a decent array of extras, including Easter Egg alternate title sequences for a couple of the film's many video reissues as Deadly Mission and G.I. Bro (it's also known as Counterfeit Commandos, Hell's Heroes and Commando Bastards) a cheap-and-cheerful hour long making of, brief then and-now tour of the locations with Castellari and a CD (not included on the 2-disc set) of what little remains of the score - the composer recorded his son's school play over most of the masters! By far the most curious of the extras is an interview with Quentin Tarantino and Castellari, with the chin treating it as part confessional, part therapy, unburdening himself on the engaging director as if an unworthy disciple at the feet of a true master.",1232496000,5,2869,4.88911704312115
947550,4,6305019878,"Inglorious bastards is probably director Castellari's best film. A series of events lead to a group of soldiers (led by Bo Svenson) accepting a deadly mission in order to not reveal that they are actually escaped convicts. They decide to try and exonerate themselves as the mission could change the course of the war. The film features certainly one of the very few decent performances by Fred Williamson (because he doesn't get a chance to talk about himself too much), and surprisingly most of the other unknown cast members are also up to the challenge. Bo Svenson without a doubt, is the man in charge here. Unlike many european movies, the comedy scenes are not too goofy to be funny here. The best action comes at the end with a peckinpah-style bloody shootout, the movie could have used more of that at the beginning and middle. As with most Castellari films the dialog is not as important as the action but thankfully the comedic moments remedy this. The bad guys becomes good guys idea really works. 16x9 dvd and bluray picture quality are much better than most retro releases",1227830400,,1085,4.746031746031746

The acting is pretty good and the story, while implausible, is pretty cool. All of the actors were perfect for their role. Other than Bo Svenson, Fred Williamson, and Ian Bannen, I have not seen any of the other actors since. It's too bad. I would like to see them in something else. By the way, if any of you out there who were in the service is wondering why Bo Svenson sounds authentic calling cadence in the movie, it is because he was in the Marines for six years. The movie is relatively short by today's standards so pause it if you go to the bathroom. Anyway, a great and fun movie. I loved it as a kid and do today.",1218758400,21,792,4.018987341772152
947552,4,6305019878,"Enzo Castellari and Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson?  Why the hell isn't this DVD in your cart yet?
I remember seeing this movie in it's edited version entitled G.I. Bro back in the day, but now I finally got to see it in it's original version.
It's the story of a small group of military prisoners who escape while being transported to the slammer, but through a clever plot twist wind up on a top secret mission with the French and U.S. military.
It's fun stuff.  Not a heartwrenching war pic, but a fun little adventure film.  Bo Svenson(from the Walking Tall sequels and T.V. show) is the lieutenant who leads the bunch.  He does a decent job.  Fred Williamson is...well, Fred Williamson.  It's pretty hard for him not to be cool.  The movie goes about throwing the group from one action sequence to another until the final mission.  There is quite a bit of action.  It looks like Castellari was working with a decent budget.  Castellari certainly doesn't get enough credit as a director in the U.S.  The guy's pretty damn good.
The 3 disc version gives us a ""Conversation with Enzo Castellari and Quentin Tarantino"".  Naturally Tarantino dominates this discussion considering he can't shut up and Castellari doesn't speak English too well.  Tarantino is remaking Inglorious Bastards, and that is discussed a bit.  Apparently the movie means alot to him.  Personally I'm discouraged to hear Tarantino jumping on the remake bandwagon, but at least you can say he truly loves this film unlike other directors who have remade movies(most likely half of those directors never even saw the film they were remaking until they were hired to make it).  Anyhow, the interview is about 35 minutes long.  There a documentary on the making of the film that features Castellari, Bo Svenson, Fred Williamson, as well as members of the fx crew and screenwiters.  Also is a documentary with Castellari showing the shooting locations.  The third disc is the film's soundtrack.
A good movie and a good package.",1217635200,3,1993,4.84319526627219

947554,4,6305019878,"Wahoo!!  Let's grab some beer and go shoot our machine guns at some Nazis!

Inglorious Bastards is a campy cult war flick, high on violence and insanity but a little low on common sense.  You've got a bunch of reject U.S. soldiers facing court martial for various infractions, like flying the jetplane to visit their girlfriend a few thousand miles away.
On the way to the military prison the convoy gets hit by some German artillery.  This enables a few of the prisoners to escape.  This ragtag group decides to head for neutral Switzerland while avoiding the American armies plus the Nazis.
Now along the way there is all sorts of unrestrained madness.  The highlight has got to be when they stumble across the female German soldiers skinny dippin in the lake.  Allright!  Just what you expect to see when running for your life through Europe.  The soldiers masquerade as Nazis and get ready for some wet-n-wild fun.

Inglorious Bastards is an entertaining thrill ride that makes war seem like a party.  The acting is decent.  I recognized the cigar-smokin' Fred Williamson from Rodriquez's classic From Dusk til Dawn.
