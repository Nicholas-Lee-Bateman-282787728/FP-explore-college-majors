8078306,3,6304622236,"I honestly expected this film to be terrible, but it's not bad.  It's about a mother and son who scalp young college students and sell their hair as wigs.  There's some pretty good gore fx for 1967, and the opening scene  with the bewigged styrofoam heads talking to each other is one of the  weirdest scenes in a film I have ever seen.  I showed this  to a friend of  mine and she freaked out, so I can safely say that it's worth renting,  especially for Herchell Gordon Lewis fans.",953683200,,483,4.288888888888889
8078307,4,6304622236,"Considering the year this film was made, it was far ahead of its time.  This film has everything that anyone could want in a low-budget gore film: hot bad acting women, lots of blood and guts, and lots of weirdness.  I bet  their is not another film of its time which graphically shows a womens  liver being ripped from her belly.  Basic storyline:  An old lady and her  son own a wig shop, which specializes in human hair wigs, which the son  carves of the heads of female victims.  This is a classic for any gore fan,  right Napolean?",944179200,2,536,4.3232323232323235
