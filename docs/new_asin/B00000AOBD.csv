7905831,5,B00000AOBD,When I was a little kid my dad would watch Sargeant Bilko.  I was allowed to stay up ONLY if I was very good all day and very quiet during the prgram.  It is good to be able to watch and laugh without being sent to bed.  Thank You for making it all possible.,1331942400,,258,3.740740740740741
7905832,5,B00000AOBD,"In the attention span starved present day, its a delight to see what a real ""situation comedy"" is all about. The Bilko show deftly sets the basis for the laughs that follow as the show develops. And what could be a better source of material than a clever conniving character like Bilko - a sergeant in the army who is always looking for the fast buck! A pity the entire series isn't available, but then again, I don't know if my gut can take more laughing!",1025740800,10,456,4.313953488372093
