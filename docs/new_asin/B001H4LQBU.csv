3622681,3,B001H4LQBU,"IN TRANZIT  is one of those forgotten films the viewer wants to love: an all but unknown bit of history based on a true story that offers a different insight into the universal damage inflicted upon all peoples by WW II.  The problem with this production is the embarrassingly weak script by Natalia Portonova and Simon van der Borgh, the unfocused direction by Tom Roberts and the bumpy editing by Paul Carlin.  Beautifully photographed by Sergei Astakhov in a manner that emphasizes the brutality of Russian winters, setting a perfect matrix for the drama, this film had potential, but even the isolated acting contributions of a few seasoned actors cannot hide the weak script and the annoying pacing.

1946 and a Russian Women's prisoner of war camp lays unused until it is determined by one evil Russian officer Pavlov (John Malkovich) that it will become a camp for German prisoners of war to ferret out occult members of the Nazi SS group that inflicted such agony on the Russians. The camp is run by a group of angry Russian women soldiers and one Russian physician Natalia (Vera Farmiga) who together with Citizen Zina (Natalie Press) represent the humanistic side of the suffering Russian victims of the German brutality. And so it is German men, including the handsome Max (Thomas Kretschmann) who shares a mutual attraction with Natalia and the enigmatic Klaus (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) among others, versus the Russian women: role reversal and gender dominance changes create the drama. One key mute figure is Andrei (the brilliant Russian actor Yevgeni Mironov), the psychologically damaged husband of Natalia, who in many ways represents the tragedy of the entire WW II on mankind.  How these two groups of people interact and survive the conditions imposed on them forms the story.

Though Farmiga and Kretschmann, Press and Mironov overcome the awkward script in an attempt to suffuse this film with palpable tragedy, the result is a bumpy ride through the obvious pitfalls of amateur filmmaking.  It could have been an important film, but is remains a minor though interesting insight as to the extended effects of war on people's psyches.

3622682,4,B001H4LQBU,"""In Tranzit"" is a unique post WW II drama set in Leningrad, Russia and is based on true events. The year is 1946, and a group of German POWs are sent to a prison camp run by female guards [the camp was formerly for women]. Vera Farmiga plays Natalia, the compassionate doctor who treats the prisoners as human beings, whereas the majority of the guards treat the prisoners with disdain. One guard is particularly sadistic, though her treatment of the prisoners needs to be framed within the context of her past, as her family was murdered by German soldiers.

With limitations of food and other rations, everyone tries to make do and function the best they can, but things get complicated with the demands of John Malkovich, who plays Pavlov, a high-ranking Russian officer who commands Natalia to get information for him. The information requested is about Nazi SS officers who are hiding amongst the prisoners, and Natalia's job is to weed them out. She is reluctant mainly because she doesn't think it's part of her job, but Pavlov holds a threat over her that has to do with Andrei[Yevgeni Mironov], the mentally unbalanced gatekeeper of the camp.

As the period of incarceration progresses, boundaries are crossed - Natalia finds herself drawn to Max, one of the POWs [credibly portrayed by Thomas Kretschmann], others discover intimacy and even love even though it is forbidden, and a musical band is also formed amongst the inmates.

This is supposed to be a true story, and I for one thought this was an interesting drama as it dramatizes a relatively unfamiliar series of events, having to do with German POWs incarcerated in a Russian prison camp [especially the part where some of the inmates are allowed to live with women off the camp]. Though I'm very familiar with the events of the Holocaust, this part of history was a revelation to me.

The acting, especially by Vera Farmiga as the kind and strong-willed Natalia was amazing, and this is definitely one of her best roles to date [she recently portrayed the CIA operative outed in the movie ""Nothing But the Truth""]. John Malkovich somehow seems wasted in this role and his performance was not particularly compelling. The other performance which deserves mention is Yevgeni Mironov's Andrei, who gives a compelling dialogue-free performance, portraying a mentally unstable person.
The DVD extra consists of a ""Making of Tranzit"" feature with director Tom Roberts.

Highly recommended for those interested in history and dramas of substance.",1241740800,,2509,4.978520286396181

3622685,2,B001H4LQBU,"A movie about what German POW's experienced in the USSR would have been fascinating, and this movie was based on a true story. So why not 5 stars? Because it was unclear. Who are the women who danced with the prisoners and who spent the night with them? Are they Russians? And why would the camp doctor let the prisoners spend the night with them? At one scene, a man is saying goodbye to a pregnant woman with a kid. Are they his kids or the kids of a dead Russian?

Why did the gatekeeper used the card of a king to communicate? Why was he storing pills? We hear that there was SS among the prisoners, yet the crimes of the SS are barely mentioned.

Suffice to say, the movie started well but it falls apart. A movie needs to be CLEAR, I need to know what's going on, I also don't need two sex scenes, specially the pointless one at the theater. Who was that cute blond? I don't know. Was he a prisoner or guard? I don't know.

Maybe this movie should be called ""I Don't Know"" because Vera Farmiga certainly doesn't know how to make a movie.",1503792000,2,1043,4.17910447761194

3622696,4,B001H4LQBU,"Great Movie.
Some reviewers here have said this was based on a true story.  I did not give it 5 stars because I found it simply unbelievable historically.  Not unbelievable that German POWs wound up in a Russian female supervised prison camp, but that the humanity of both the Germans and the Russians could actually emerge in such a setting.  The references to the Leningrad siege are absolutely true.  Russians did eat rats to survive and near the end, Soviet soldiers had to enforce anti-cannibal laws upon their starving citizens.  Nearly 90% of  German POW's died in Russian prison camps - however, Russians were treated no better with an equal rate of demise due to disease and starvation in German POW camps.  Given the destruction that these armies wreaked upon each other and their citizens, it is hard to believe that people in the military on either side could be so forgiving so soon after the war.  That women from the town would sleep with German POWs seems equally unbelievable, since many of them probably lost their husbands to the German army.  Now why give it 4 stars?  Well the acting was superb as was the cinematography. I shivered from cold throughout the movie, felt the hopelessness of the POWs in that stark and unforgiving camp, the empathy of the doctor and her captain, and even the anger and bitterness of Pavlov.  All of the things which I said seemed historically unbelievable are the very things that made this such a heart rending, romantic story.  A story perhaps about the true human spirit of kindness and empathy - that gets lost or crushed in the horror of war, but somehow survives it and reemerges when the carnage finally stops. I fell totally in love with the Soviet doctor, and was near tears at her plight in the end.  What a wonderful job by that actress.  What a wonderful character created by the writers and developed by the director.  Yeah, if I could get past the historical concerns, it was a five star movie.",1501632000,3,1961,4.6763848396501455

The story excludes the female prisoners after the first few minutes and focuses exclusively on the German POW's. I was a bit confused by difficulty the guards had identifying ""war criminals"" (assuming they were SS and not Werhmacht), and they overlooked the first litmus test of looking for the blood tattoo. However, it was entertaining if not entirely historically believable and Farmiga, Malkovich and one of my personal favorites Kretschmann did a great job.

3622729,4,B001H4LQBU,"It's a wonderful idea for a film, and the script COULD have been a masterpiece. But it fails in the end,regrettably. I thought the cast was superb, well chosen. Malkovich is great as the malevolent Pavlov, and Vera Farmiga and Kretschmann perform believably as the lovers caught in a complicated web of conflicting loyalties. The Soviets used women much more in combat, combat support and in the factories than the Germans ever did, and the Soviet women are used as prison guards for the German soldiers in postwar Russia in this film.

These German soldiers obviously have greater loyalties among themselves, and would never reveal if any one of them had Nazi leanings. Therein lies the major film plot. Pavlov wants the Germans to betray each other, using the doctor to find out whom among them has these thoughts. The true evil of the Soviet system was based, not on what people did, but what they thought. In the end, he succeeds, getting Kretschmann to betray his fellow soldier. The mixed emotions that both the German soldier and the Soviet doctor feel is in stark contrast to Pavlov's feeling of triumph. He has a name, and a death, to turn over to his bosses.

There is also a great scene where the Germans are working for a jewish manager, and, as he says, they perform ""ably and efficiently, but what do you expect, they're Germans"". Truly ironic. Another stark reality of the movie is the fact that, many years after the war, German prisoners (particularly engineers) were rebuilding the Soviet state that they had destroyed, constructing buildings, mines and factories.

Where the film really fails is explaining all the background of the Soviet/German conflict. I suppose that's going to take another 30 minutes of film to accurately depict. By the way, I use the words German and Soviet, and perhaps I should use the word Nazi and Communist, as there were Russians fighting for the Nazis, and Germans fighting for the Communists. Complicated, I suppose.",1429228800,4,1968,4.86865671641791

It's a magnificent movie; bleak, but romantic, troubling as it is hopeful. I was so moved after watching it the first time that the following day I watched it twice, to check on the nuances of each character. Thomas Krestchmann has become one of my favorite actors and his subtle performance in this film was understated and moving. Vera Farmiga and John Malkovich give equally compelling performances, along with the supporting cast. No spoilers here, except to say love is forgiveness and love knows no political party or nation.

He just sort of breezes in and out, and you wonder why/how he always shows up at the times he does.

3622758,4,B001H4LQBU,"This is suppose to be a true story and I feel it is up to one small point, the 'search' for the SS members out of a group of 51 German Prisoners of War is a sub plot around the romance and intimacies. Set after WW 2 we are transported to the freezing icy prison run by some nasty Commies.

These relationships grow between the German prisoners and thier all female Russian guards - well stuff was always gonna happen. There is a small however, it was pretty common knowledge that most SS (and some Wehrmacht)men had thier blood groups tattoed on thier left arms (for medical purposes). So a quick check could have solved the mystery, but toward the end of the war this practice became the exception to the rule, so its not really a 'deal breaker'.

Only other gripe is that they all speak English albeit with reasonably good accents, but it tends to take away from the reality in that language would have been a barrier to communication at the beginning unless in the real true story they were all bi lingual, a petty gripe I know especially as I actually wasn't in the mood for a sub titled film.

All that aside the acting is excellent from all concerned especially Thomas Kretchman, Malkovich is just Malkovich which is always enough and he does help ratchet up the tension. There are enough twists to keep the plot moving at an unnoticably reasoned pace and as such it passes the test of all good films in that you don't feel bored or check your watch. If you like plots with intrigue and a genuine attempt to make a non Hollywood style film then you will enjoy In Tranzit.",1347667200,4,1577,4.412371134020619
3622759,3,B001H4LQBU,"This movie was a good idea and it has some superb actors and actresses in it.  The sets are fantastic, but as others have said, the script, or lack thereof, is very noticable.  IN TRANZIT could have been a superb movie, but the story line is extremely sketchy at best.  This is SUPPOSED to be based on a true story, but they never go into any details about the ""true story"" even in the extra features, and given the implausibility of this tale, I have an EXTREMELY hard time believing that.  Perhaps the ""true story"" is that Russians had German prisoners long after the war was over?

Malkovich is wasted in this movie, as his parts are very short and were obviously shot perhaps all on the same day - two or three at the most, as he always wears the same ridiculous looking overcoat and for some reason never wears a cap - didn't understand that - it's winter in Leningrad, icy cold, and he's bald and never wears a cap?

The actress who plays the nurse in this film is the ONLY redeeming factor - she is phenomenal in this movie and delivers a fantastic performance given what she had to work with.  Likewise, her mentally wounded husband (the actor) gives a great performance as the gate keeper for the camp.  Kretschman, whom I really like, isn't given a chance in this movie as he has hardly any lines, he's on screen very little, and you NEVER understand how he and the head nurse establish a relationship because they're never together until, all of a sudden, there's this passionate love scene that comes out of nowhere, then goes away just as quickly.  In short, everything was here to make a fantastic movie, and they simply cobbled together a disjointed mess that leaves you going - ""that was it?"" at the end.

Can't recommend this one, but if you can get it cheap, it's worth seeing just to watch a lovely actress rise above a terrible script and horrible job of directing - she single-handedly made this film bearable.",1331769600,,1931,4.491428571428571

The soldiers are dumped on a group of female guards who have their own horrible war experiences, add to this mix a soviet intelligence officer(KGB?) with an agenda to find any SS officers among them. This movie is about what war and politics does to people, some remain decent others are monsters. All the main characters are well done, you really feel for the doctor and her brain damaged husband, you even feel for the Germans. Perhaps the cynical moral of this tale is do not loose a war.",1321228800,14,652,4.581196581196581

3622763,3,B001H4LQBU,"There is an interesting story to be told about German POWs and their female Russian guards following the defeat of Germany in World War II. Because of its weak script, this film does not succeed in doing so.

According to the marketing statement on this DVD's hardcase, this is the story: ""In the chaotic aftermath of WWII, a group of German POWs are accidentally sent to a female-run Soviet prison camp. When the guards are given the task of weeding out the SS officers, they play a bitter game of cat and mouse with the prisoners. Each group slowly learns that situations are not what they seem; prejudices are sometimes unjustly held; and love can be found in even the harshest places."" This muddled and unfocused blurb is less than half accurate. E.g., only one woman (the camp's doctor, played by Vera Farmiga) is given the mission of identifying the SS officers, and she uses no cat-and-mouse game to do so. On the other hand, according to the discussion in the bonus features, the story was supposed to be about how the Russians and their German enemies learned to forgive each other. This is not accurate either.

What we are shown is a kaleidoscopic array of often unconnected elements that do not provide us with a story arc or combinations of two or three or four story arcs that make any unified sense. Some guards act with nobility and dignity, some steal food, some seek to gratify their sexual desires, some enjoy inflicting pain, and so on--which merely gives us a cross-section of humanity that might exist almost anywhere on earth. At intervals, SS officers are mysteriously plucked out of the prison population by a male Soviet officer (John Malkovich). At intervals, policies are mysteriously changed by the Soviet government--or by Malkovich's character. E.g., near the end of the film, the prisoners are given musical instruments, a dance is arranged with them and several dozen local Russian women, some of the prisoners begin living with Russian women outside the POW camp, and the gatekeeper of the camp (the mentally disabled husband of the camp's doctor) is taken away. What do these events all add up to?

They seem to be scraps of drafts of four or five scripts that were never quite completed. Perhaps they are.",1254009600,26,2241,4.800518134715026

8307783,4,B001H4LQBU,"I was going in thinking it would be another prisoner of war movie with sadistic guards and dehumanizing stereotypes. Instead I had an enjoyable experience watching a humanitarian war in place of an ideological one. Both sides were portrayed as humans who have suffered and are incomplete; not as typical war movie tropes of dangerous, inhuman sadists and heroic victims. Vera Farmiga makes a Soviet uniform look nice, Malkovich is as keen as ever, and Kretschman plays his usual 'good German soldier' role. But all is not as it seems. As the NKVD officer intent on rooting out war criminals from the segregated group of German prisoners, Malkovich always knows more than what he lets on. The prisoners are portrayed as human  beings, some of whom did horrible things in desperate situations. Vera is the conflicted doctor of the camp, depressed and lonely, yet doing her job as a communist administrator at a POW camp. There are elements of romance and drama, but what I liked was the subtle tension that gently builds throughout. Who are they looking for? Who is the 'informer'? The last 15 minutes lead to a pleasant twist, ending with significant character development for the pair of protagonists (Farmiga, Kretschman) and left me satisfied. Better than I had expected.",1506816000,,1273,4.976525821596244

8307786,5,B001H4LQBU,"I loved this. The acting is superb. A lot of people have a problem with the script and pace, but I for one think they did an incredible job all around... they didn't need to put dates, or mark the passage of time- that's the point of the POW experience, time ceased to have meaning because of the endless grueling days. It's important for the viewer to remember that German POWs spent ten years in those camps before returning home. This film showed rather than told. You see the group cohesion among the women guards solidify as first the cruelest guard is taken away, and then again when they lose one of their own. They go from suspicious of one another to working with each other, complicit in the liberties they allow the POWs to take. They are in a lonely area, one can assume that the camp is remote, despite the beginning statement that it was ""in Leningrad""... concentration camps in the Soviet Union frequently said ""in"" the nearest city, but in actuality would be over a day's drive away. So on the one hand, you observe the change in the guard's demeanor, reflective of anyone whose toxic work environment improves with the removal of the worst people. And you can see the friendships among them. Each character has their own mystery, and I liked that- too many movies answer all of the questions, this one leaves you wondering, it's closer to real life. I found myself at times liking Pavlov, at other times despising him- but one should keep in mind that if you objectively observe NKVD employees, many of them couldn't afford to show compassion, because they were just as subject to being purged as the rest of Soviet society. You don't know for sure if the most ""likable"" German (aside from Peter) is good or bad-there is always that line ""I know who you were before"" that makes you wonder, and thus, it's conceivable he was lying when he said he didn't know who was guilty of war crimes, and said that he himself hadn't committed any. All you can do is judge them from how they conduct themselves in the camp, and he's certainly honorable enough there. The Doctor is also fascinating- you really want to know about her life with her husband, before he was injured. A picture of him in her office suggests he was highly decorated in the Soviet military before his head injury. He's an inscrutable character, at times seeming to mock Pavlov, other times not even recognizing that the Doctor is his wife. I also think that it was brilliant that they don't disclose the contents of the note- it's something private. As an audience, we are too used to having things spelled out for us. The ending leaves you with the sense of how remote and lonely the camp is, and the lives of the citizens who live near it- noticeably there are almost no men left, and even at the dance you see women partnering with each other. This was a very truthful feeling touch- so many men died, the Soviet losses were far higher than anyone else in WW2, there would have been a strangely empty feeling in the cities as people tried to resume their lives. I only have two contentions with this film. 1) Language. The fact that it's in English doesn't bother me (even if there are slightly different English accents, one can expect that Russian accents vary depending upon where the Russian is from, so if the film is in English, then the characters might as well have slightly different accents, which would reflect different cities of birth) but they should have done a better job of indicating who was bilingual and when the conversations were in German or Russian- this is relevant because it helps understand how much the people around the speakers actually understand. 2) One POW is identified as a war criminal because of a birth mark. Any tattoos and birth marks should have been recorded immediately in the first medical assessment of the prisoners. And the SS men usually had their blood type tattooed on their arm- since it's stated they are looking for SS men, they should have found them more quickly. Granted, there were some who never did that (Mengele comes to mind) but the majority of them did, and if they caught one, the Soviets would most likely have ferreted out the rest. Other than that though, I loved this film. The performances were really incredible, and make you want to know every single character's back story. I would also like to know the ""true story"" this is based off of, because so far I have been unable to find any books/memoirs that this could have been based on.",1506384000,2,4489,4.591531755915318

8307788,4,B001H4LQBU,Unrealistic but entertaining and unique. The grim bombed out Soviet factory that serves as the prison is authentic and you can feel the sub-zero temperatures throughout the film.
