2652837,3,B000I2J5TM,"Justin is a gay man in his early 20's, working for his overbearing father's ad agency in Austin TX.  On a trip to a rural area to meet with a client, his car gets stuck right in front of the ""Angora Ranch"" (2006), a rabbit ranch run by Jack and his father Peter.  Although almost twice his age, Jack senses a mutual attraction with Justin, so Peter and the town's lady mechanic plot to get Justin to stay the night to give them a chance. Justin is too nervous about how his father will react to his having to postpone the meeting, and heads out to his meeting first thing in the morning, only to return when a stowaway bunny proves to be the key to the ad campaign.  With the pressure off, Justin and Jack do hit it off nicely, until Justin's father makes an unexpected visit to rant about their age difference and ""lifestyle"", but loses his thunder when a secret from his own youth comes out.

The photography and production values are surprisingly good for a bare bones indie film shot directly on video.  However, I didn't have to check the IMDB credits to know the cast was inexperienced, as EVERY actor in the film came off like a night of amateur theatre tryouts, with horrible overacting, emoting as if each line was Shakespeare, and sometimes even looking at the camera instead of the character they are speaking with.  Thomas Romano as Justin was cute, but didn't really fit his character, and it is amazing that not ONE of the main characters in rural Texas had any trace of an accent.  The screenplay (by director Paul Bright, who also played Jack) is sweet and charming, but more than a bit overdone and contrived.  (However, it could have been worse; the extras divulge that the original concept was for this to be a MUSICAL!)  DVD has ""making of"" featurette and some candid shots.  Rate it 3 stars out of 5.",1165017600,20,1821,4.457831325301205
2652838,5,B000I2J5TM,I liked the story and the cute actors and considering the budget I thought they did an excellant job. I would recommend to everyone.,1164067200,4,132,4.541666666666667
2652839,1,B000I2J5TM,"It's difficult to fathom that anyone would make such a bad movie.  I agree that the young lead actor is very cute, but that's the only redeeming quality this movie has.  The storyline had potential, but it failed miserably because of poor acting and dialogue.  My friends and I just shook our heads in dismay when we watched this.",1163980800,10,330,4.559322033898305
2652840,4,B000I2J5TM,"Got a chance to see this fun movie in Austin - I guess it was filmed in a small TX town nearby. The story is very mature, and I thought it was a fresh take on gay relationships. It is also very funny! One of my only criticisms is that the production budget seemed very low - maybe that's why the scenes sometimes look stiff and the acting feels a bit staged. Despite those flaws, I really had a great time watching this movie. Oh, and the young actor playing the lead is gorgeous - with a beautiful body and totally adorable smile!",1158278400,22,531,4.165048543689321
2652841,4,B000I2J5TM,"Though this movie has a low budget and some flaky characters, it succeeds in being entertaining, especially if you like bunnies, rural settings and plenty of kookiness. The sexy and buff, not to mention charming and gorgeous, Thomas Romano carries this film with his character's sweet-hearted persona and willingness to find love in the most unlikely of places. The plot may be too simplistic for some and, at times, gets lost in ""bunny talk.""  But Thomas Romano is ""gold."" And that ""gold"" gets this film four stars. There aren't many younger man-older man films out there, so this might be a good date movie for the right couple.",1305244800,,630,4.833333333333333
2652842,1,B000I2J5TM,"It should be a huge red flag when the writer-director of a gay film is also playing one of the leads....and the other lead is twenty years younger than him.  This film was hilarious at moments, but I'm sure not at the moments Paul Bright expected to be amusing.  Bright's acting was the bottom of the barrel in a barrel full of bad actors.

Also, it is nearly impossible to believe that Paul Bright was only 41 when this film was shot.  He looks mid-fifties....and a very ragged mid-fifties at that.  I guess writing roles like this for himself in movies is the only way he get anywhere near a younger hot guy.  And the gratuitous scenes of his naked ass are absolutely unnecessary.  One last note....you'd think the writer and director of a movie would know enough to not look directly at the camera....but he did it several times!

If you want a cringe-inducing laugh, go ahead and watch this drivel.  Or just fastforward to get a nice shot of Thomas Romano's ass....there are many.  Or you could just go buy one of his porn movies.  I don't doubt he has done quite a few.",1304208000,3,1074,4.428571428571429
2652843,2,B000I2J5TM,"After I had read the summary of the story I was really happy that there was finally a gay theme movie about relationship with an age gap in the background.
But then I started to watch and realized in a blink of an eye that the final product is quite miserable.
The low budget factor is visible in every single minute of this film. But it is not the worst. And it is not the reason I give it only 2 stars.
It is the acting.
It seems as if 95% of the crew was cought in the street and set in front of the camera...The last 5% is reserved to Tim Jones who portrayed Jack's father (btw, he past away year after the film was released).
Unfortunately, it is hard not to notice that he was too young to play a 60 year old pa (check out the scene where he appears chest naked - hottie).
Well, I would lie if I wrote that I didn't enjoy it. But I wouldn't book for it a place in my dvdteque neither.",1303689600,,890,3.9226519337016574
2652844,5,B000I2J5TM,"This is the classic low budget movie; all in this movie call to lack of money, the setting, the soundtrack, the use of the camera... but in all its faults, I can't avoid to like it. The two main characters are so funny, Thomas Romano is so unbelievable flamboyant and Paul Bright is so sweet. Even Paul Bright's father in the movie was so right for his role (sadly the actor died soon after the movie's release...). If you want a sweet and funny movie and you are willing to let it pass all the faults, Angora Ranch for me was a discovery.",1278288000,,539,4.242718446601942
2652845,4,B000I2J5TM,"Angora Ranch is, needless to say, a very low budget film. I watched it on Amazon on Demand because I got to rent a movie for free and I thought what the heck. I can't say I regretted renting this movie. When I say it is hilariously adorable, I mean it. I think that is the only reason I gave this movie four stars. It's not because it is the best acting in the world, I gave it four stars because it made me laugh, throughout the whole movie nearly. The cast isn't played by the best actors in the world and I am not going to lie to you and say they were amazing. A lot of lines sounded too forced to be natural and I agree with the reviewer who said Benny the rabbit was the best actor. But the movie has a plot that makes you sympathize with the leads, Justin and Jackson. With Justin and his demanding, overbearing father and Jackson with his father who has dementia, the plot makes it relatable to gay and straight viewers. I found myself really feeling for the characters in between my bouts of hysterical laughter. The movie is funny, mostly unintentionally, but it is funny nevertheless. The movie has many corny scenes in it, including a near dominatrix kink sex dream, and Justin, Jackson and the locals of Cottonwood have an unfortunate habit of breaking into really awkward song. While it sometimes makes you roll your eyes or pause the movie because you can't see through your tears of laughter, the movie is enjoyable. I am not sure if I would actually buy this movie given the chance but it is worth seeing at least once, if only to watch an adorable bunny yawn at the end of the film.",1277769600,,1599,4.3156146179401995
2652846,5,B000I2J5TM,"This is a great date movie for a new gay couple on their first or second date! But also a good film for anyone...even an older single guy like me!

I especially loved it when the two main characters end up in a karaoke cafe' and despite their age differences, they begin to find they have things in common. During this scene one feels like they are on the date with the guys! A very touching and realistic date scene.

For me (at first) I had issues with all the characters being played by gay men--including the straight roles (because all of us gay men tend to have some gay mannerisms or effeminacy, and that seemed to take away from the realism of certain straight characters in the film, I thought.) But then I realized how special it was to have a film that starred ALL gay men! How often does THAT happen?!!

I loved the serious ""dad issues"" followed by quirkiness (like the scene in bed when both guys say ""Train!"" as one of the characters gets tossed from his bed by a passing train!) And loved the tender quirkiness when the younger guy says he's okay with sleeping on the sofa and the older guy says sadly, ""You are?"" (You'd have to see it to know what I mean.) And especially the ending ""musical"" theme in the church...and the guys singing in the theater (adorable!)

And the final scene, involving a bunny, was precious! I wanted a bunny of my own for a whole week!!

I'm proud that gay men have come together to make a film like this and I'm so glad to own it! True, it won't win any Academy awards...but it has won my heart.

2652847,3,B000I2J5TM,"a sweet low budget movie. Allthough the story is thin, and the actors themselves don't get many opportunities to develope their ability of acting, it is a lovely little piece. Justin, the young blond men is a really cute eyecatch, he is fallen for the older guy, - what happens too fast and that imposes unrealistically - and actually the whole movie appears as a kind of cheap production, but still it is lovely; especially the scenes with the animals, (the goat, which is eating roses, and the angora rabbits, which are really cute).
So all these things are making this production to a sweet, lovely (even though shallow) story, which on one hand does not fullfill high expectations, but on the other hand it is worth a 3-star-review, especially based on the characters themself, and in consideration of the lack of a full budget; it is a good work.

2652848,5,B000I2J5TM,"Omigosh ..... Omigosh ..... Omigosh ..... Omigosh. Then when it was finally over, I realized that what makes ANGORA RANCH so endearing (after initially perceiving it to be all the naysayers say it is minus 10), is the uncanny ability this film has to curl around your person and eventually take full possession; simple plot, simple acting, simple props and meager budget all combine to somehow win your loyalty. In other words, ANGORA RANCH is so filled with QUAINT UNASSUMING QUIRKYNESS that all these and other negativities too numerous to mention facilitate the entire proceedings in morphing to triumphantly, by the ""final curtain"", become GOOD! MORE than good; FANTASTIC! And the toy trains and totally over-the-top unsophisticated music are way kool! ANGORA RANCH is a catharsis for all that is phony in gay life. Sometimes simplicity deserves to win, and ANGORA RANCH is a winner.",1251504000,,887,5.124137931034483
2652849,2,B000I2J5TM,"This movie's intentions are SO good that I really wanted to like it, but everything about it is SO bad that I just couldn't. The story is okay, but the dialog is maudlin and unbelievable, and the acting is painful to watch. The problem isn't lack of money, it's lack of talent. Many good movies have been made with no money, but this isn't one of them.

The only good thing I can find to say about it is that both Thomas Romano and Paul Bright are attractive and likeable men. But neither of them can act, and the other two actors are just unwatchable. Angora Ranch is about as excruciating as any movie I've ever seen. Its spirit is sweet, and I wish its makers well, but I can't recommend it to anybody.",1245888000,,705,4.2611940298507465

2652851,1,B000I2J5TM,"Reading over the reviews presented here makes me wonder if I had seen the same film as the other reviewers or if maybe their Prozac dosage might not have been a little on the high side.
  This is without a doubt one of the worst gay-themed films ever made. The acting,if one could call it that, is beyond amateurish,it's cringe inducing. The heavy handed and wink-wink, oh so cute script is truly terrible. That someone would actually provide funding for such a piece of dreck is beyond reasoning.
  If you want to see an excellent gay film, purchase ""Shelter""  it's flawless!!",1207094400,3,577,4.673267326732673
2652852,1,B000I2J5TM,"Poor production values, a lame script and some heartfelt but otherwise lacklustre performances all contribute to drag down what could have been a good story. If the characters were any more one dimensional they'd be cardboard. The whole thing is so over simplified in the set-ups and then the acting doesn't help the story's credibility at all. Truly a shame.
With a different cast and a better screenwriter this story may have had a chance. It wants to be The Sum Of Us, and it ends up not adding up to enough to hold a movie together.",1202428800,5,536,4.536082474226804

2652854,4,B000I2J5TM,"Justin and Jack meet, there is chemistry from the start and small hurdles to overcome before they hook up and settle down.  These include age difference (and who cares how old the man you are feeling is?); Justin's Dad (who has his own past and current issues); Jack's Dad who has early stage dimentia (but has enough marbles to play Cupid) and the issues about Justin's career.  But the reality is that these don't hold anything up for long - in fact the build up of boy (ie in his 20's) meets man (46) and battle all that are keeping them apart takes all of a day or so...my kind of timeline, don't waste time on the inconsequentials get to the LOVE part.

The production could have been better but it doesn't detract from a nice movie.  The actors need more work in their chosen field, as the other reviewers have said, but I think there is more naturalness in there than they have been given credit for - not a bad thing.  The script flowed in a natural dialogue for the most part - just the acting let it down in some parts - but that doesn't ruin it for me.

I liked the premise, that love can result from a wrong turn - where can I make that wrong turn?

More could have been made of the Justin's Father's (the towel boy) interlude with Jack in their younger days - a flashback would have introduced more sensuality/sex into the movie.

Angora Ranch is long on looks and dialogue and very very light on actual sexual intimacy which is a bit disappointing.

I don't think the spectre of dimentia or Alzheimers (they are different) and the affects on the individual and families was handled well.  The Dad may have been in the early stages but huge symptoms and effects were apparent - so what is the reality that someone would enter into a relationship with a man that age with that disease to the degree of moving him out of his son's house and into their own when they are running a business?  Very little.

Overall the acting could be better but the cute bunnies make up for that.  A bit more sex is always welcome - speaking from personal experience and my preference for passion. BUT I LOVE a love story - as I keep saying.

So on this stormy Sunday afternoon in New Zealand I give this movie a 4 out of 5 and will watch it again.  It made me smile too many times not to watch it again:0)",1178323200,6,2299,4.277136258660508
2652855,3,B000I2J5TM,"No, this is not another version on the Brokeback Mountain theme though the title might give that impression.  This little Indie film made on a shoestring budget is more like an updated Farmer's Daughter story and as such it has some charm.

Justin (the very hunky Thomas Romano) is an ad executive whose father sends him on his first solo run to a place in Texas.  While driving to his appointment Justin swerves to avoid a rabbit in the road and his car gets stuck in a ditch that just happens to be in front of the home of Jack (Paul Bright, who also wrote and directed the film) and his loony senile father.  Jack's life partner died a few years back and he is determined his plight in life is to live in solitude as caretaker for his father.  Justin is invited to spend the night while his car is fixed by the local tow truck/mechanic.  And the story unfolds from there into a May December romance that while it may not be acted very well at all, has its moments of warmth.  The plot has enough twists to keep the attention span enduring the  amateur acting status (both fathers figure significantly in surprising ways) and the cast of animals and eccentricities maintain attention.  But the eye candy provided by Thomas Romano is the strong point - if only he could act.... Grady Harp, March 07",1174176000,5,1299,4.447257383966245
2652856,5,B000I2J5TM,"A refreshing, different, cute, and feel-good film.  I admire the creators for having the guts to do something so original and with apparently a modest budget.  I grow tired of typical Hollywood films that follow a standard formula and try to blast us out of complacency and boredom just so we notice that we exist.

  It reminds me more of European films than those usually produced in the U.S.  It's quirky, has depth, doesn't try to be something it isn't, and works well within the boundaries of the plot and circumstances.  And the plot wasn't so predictable that I knew how it was going to work out in the end.

  For those of us who are gay, it's obvious that the characters are (although I wasn't sure about the women characters), and that makes it even more of a treasure.  It was believable.

2652857,5,B000I2J5TM,"I was typing a review & lost the window, so I hope this isn't a repeat, but I'm starting over on writing this . . .

I'm sorry to see the poor reviews by some on this site, whose cynical, jaded views say more about their own attitudes than they do about the film.

Among the considerable charms of this independent film are it's personal, somewhat ""home-made"" qualities, the excellent script & total sincerity of the entire enterprise. It's such a refreshing departure from standard Hollywood fare & from those ""independent"" films struggling to emulate such formulas. I love the personal touch of ANGORA RANCH, it's considerable humor & eccentricity.

Indeed, if you're open to the possibility that Love (yes, CAPPED!) exists, & that special people sometimes find one another among the teeming billions of this planet, you may find this film a treat. In fact, the virtues of this film seem to owe a lot to the director/actor Paul Bright, who also wrote the thoughtful & intelligent script. He's clearly a man of many talents & a film maker to watch.

This film is a labor of love & anyone with an open mind & open heart, regardless of your sexual orientation, will find this more than worth your while. In fact, I consider the DVD an excellent investment & suggest you recommend it to others to support & encourage this kind of creativity & the message.

What is the message? To me, it affirms the serendipity, the unexpected, quirky ways life may unfold, that Love can happen when you're least expecting it from something as seeminly unrelated as putting on the brakes to avoid running over a bunny. If anyone doesn't get it, that Love is what life is all about, too bad!

Though some gay viewers may be drawn to the cute young blond protagonist, for me it was Paul Bright's older character, the ""gay son Jackson"" that shone & dazzled me. In fact, to me he's an incredibly hot, engaging man. All of the characters have dimension & nuance. This is an alternative gem & & hope it becomes a quiet hit.

Especially fine is the performance of Tim Jones as Peter, the father of Jack. ANGORA RANCH will appeal to a range of folks of many kinds who have not given up on Love. The universe is full of possibilities. It IS possibilities! I'm really glad I own this DVD.

2652858,4,B000I2J5TM,"""Angora Ranch"" is a sweetly low-key romantic movie that has lots of animals in it. There are rabbits, goats, horses and chickens (and the cat that managed to sneak into the dinner scene). But the romance is between two men who must overcome a different kind of animal: the paternal kind. Justin (Thomas Romano) is a 20-something cutie working for his father's advertising agency, a self-absorbed manipulator whom Justin can never satisfy. (And Daddy has a few secrets on the side.) Jack (Paul Bright, ""Angora Ranch's"" writer and director) is a gay widower who has a live-in father, Peter (Tim Jones, the movie's co-writer), that is trying to push ""his gay son Jackson"" into a relationship before he slips into total senility. A chance accident and a little of Peter's meddling drops Benny the Bunny squarely into the stew and a May/September romance begins in the suburbs of Austin, Texas.

While the movie is certainly not a slick affair (in the extras, Bright and Jones joke about how their budget was in ""the thousands""), it does do several things the creators promise:

No tragic gay man dies of AIDS.

No screaming queen is running around disrupting things.

No men are just straight-acting guys claiming they're gay.

And most importantly - All gay male characters are actually played by gay men.

The acting is not going to get any Academy Award nominations, but that isn't why you're going to enjoy this. ""Angora Ranch"" is a delight for the many things it isn't. Non-hyperactive, not bitter or angry, not political (other than the general wink at gay marriage) and not aimed at the tweaker circuit coming-out crowd. This is the kind of movie I am comfortable showing to friends with dinner, and, I am going to project, feel comfortable with repeat viewings.

And it's worth it just to see a rabbit yawn.

(For those of you who only buy ""gay movies"" based on skin content, Justin appears naked from the back and the two leads have a love scene from the waist up.)",1166659200,38,1970,4.756598240469208

If some of the dialogue had been updated with respectable sassiness and a few more decent actors added, it could've been more. I think a degree of sexual tension between the leads is what kept me partly engaged. That is worth at least one star by itself. Would I buy it again if I had it to do over? Probably not.

On a scale of 1 to 10 (in ascending order), I would give ""Private Romeo"" a 10 and leave Angora Ranch at 1. The theme of Angora Ranch that age is no barrier to finding true love was somewhat sweet, I will give it that. The execution, though, was, in a word, deplorable. I didn't enjoy watching it and I certainly wouldn't recommend it.",1346803200,,524,4.645161290322581

As about every other reviewer has pointed out, the acting is not just great, and some of the scenes were a bit unbelievable. The towns people characters are corny and just a bit too spoofy, but that sad fact also gives it a light heartedness that was probably not fully intended. It does however add some appeal although I think it could have been made a whole lot better film with a little more professionalism and realism. Justin (Thomas Romano) swerves to miss a rabbit in the road and lands in the ditch in front of a farm house which just happens to be owned by a gay man twice his age. The plot begins, and the two quickly began bonding and eventually fall in love. Romano is not the greatest actor you'll ever watch but is quite adorable in looks and the way he carries himself. His older soon to be partner Jack is played by Paul Bright who also wrote and directed the film. The two ""actors"" both lack acting skills but manage to pull it off nonetheless. With a lot more work and practice, I feel that Romano probably has the ability within himself to act such a part well, but has not quite honed his acting skill. Bright would have directed a much better film had he cast someone else to play his role, and stuck to writing and directing. Perhaps the only believable actor was Tim Jones who was cast quite well in his part of Jack's senile father. Sadly he didn't live long after the film was released. This is WITHOUT DOUBT a low budget, ametuer production and with any other script would have made for a terrible film, however it somehow flows in spite of it's flaws and provides entertainment that the viewer isn't probably expecting. I like that this film does not explore all the status quo subjects that most films of today do. There's no stereotypes involved, no dark side of being gay exemplified here, no exploitation of the usual subjects of AIDS, drugs, one night stands, extreme feminism, it doesn't rely on stereotypical gay music, the gay bar scene and all that other stuff we see in about every film we watch. It also doesn't stereotype the rigidness of small rural area life, or the usual straight stereotypes either. For this reason, it does lack some realness and makes it a bit quirky but somehow manages to do so in a welcomed way. The love story is good, it provides something most of us, especially those of us older, can relate to. I just wish some cute hot young thing would knock on my door and somehow fall in love with me, but it is just a movie after all.
The sound quality is as good or better than many of the better acted films I've seen in quite some time in spite of it's other flaws. The animals add a unique touch that lightens the film alot from most other productions. I don't want to under emphasize the flaws this film has, yet I also don't wish to deter anyone from viewing this film either. If you'll chill out, relax and allow yourself the opportunity to accept this one for what it is, I honestly believe you will enjoy watching it. It has no difficulty holding a viewers attention throughout the film and certainly doesn't leave you feeling at the end that you didn't get the story, or perhaps the ending of a story that you deserved for investing your time. This is no block buster folks, but it is a good film and one to just relax with and enjoy it's uniqueness and simple charm. I recommend it for your viewing, but also warn you not to expect a masterpiece of cinematography. There are a couple special features on the DVD including some candid screenshots and a ""behind the scenes"" commentary which is pretty good. I give it four stars and have no regrets whatsoever of purchasing it.",1306368000,2,3811,4.399433427762039
