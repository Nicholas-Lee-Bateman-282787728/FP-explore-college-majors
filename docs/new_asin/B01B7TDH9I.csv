7622406,3,B01B7TDH9I,"Not a patch on series one.
Very hard to understand all the dialogue in most scenes. I suspect put together rather hastily and not enough attention paid to delivery of lines.",1465603200,,173,4.612903225806452
7622407,5,B01B7TDH9I,"I binged right through this series again, just as I had done on series 1, watching one episode right after another. Season two is strongly focused on the grandchild instead of the daughter who committed suicide (season 1 focus). The man who is believed to be that child's father is now in prison but he now has a dedicated girlfriend who is willing to do just about anything to create a father and son relationship. When she visits him in prison, he gets her all keyed up to do yet something else which will disrupt the boy's family life. The grandchild is our central character's, the police officer pictured on the box.

The way this girlfriend acts is the best part. She is so obsessed with this criminal that it is absolutely fascinating to watch her entire involvement unfold. She is NOT a psycho like character. This is truly a love lorn, easily duped woman. She is not willing to do anything malicious to the boy but she is willing to try and make his father out to be a good guy to him (when nothing is further from the truth).

Then there is the other side of the case. The grandmother policewoman is the one trying to handle her cases yet raise this child at the same time. Her sister lives with her and they also have issues from time to time. However, her sister always pulls through in the end. Both women are played by very fine actresses.

Rounding out the characters are an ex-husband, a son, the police officers junior to our lead, etc., They all do good work.

Remember that if you are in the USA, you need to have a DVD player that plays in multiple countries since there is no USA DVD version yet. However, it is also streaming, which is the way I saw it in the USA.",1465430400,,1686,4.3428571428571425
7622408,5,B01B7TDH9I,A great show. We also have season 1.  But the place is far from being a Happy Valley. A little tongue-in-cheek title.,1464220800,3,117,4.318181818181818
7622409,5,B01B7TDH9I,"Season one was spectacularly gritty and Season 2 just picks up the ball and keeps rolling with it. Frankly, I think this is one of the best cop/crime series to have ever come to TV. Sarah Lancashire deserves the UK's Emmy equivalent for her work in this series.",1461888000,5,261,4.458333333333333
7622410,2,B01B7TDH9I,"I enjoyed series one--just wish I could say the same about series 2---trouble is, I gave up watching series 2, during episode 2, reason?  couldn't  here a word what Sara Lancashire was saying. She appeared to be constantly mumbling into her radio mike on her tunic--head down so that even the aid of watching he lips move could not be used. There has been mass complaints to the BBC here, from public and media critics alike. And just as with the complaints about poor sound  clarity on the BBC 'Jamaica Inn' series, 2 years ago--the BBC declared that there was no problem with the sound. Funny that, because all the other actors could be heard --not wonderfully, but reasonably well. Besides, if the problem was with our TV 's, as they claimed, how come we could hear all other programmes that evening.--So beware. I hope that your editions are improved.  P G Croft  UK .---I'd just like to add, in support of my claim,of the  lack of sound quality for this particular show..  This very series, was the recent subject of a satirical sketch show ,here in the UK--in Tracey Ullman's new comedy series. Dressed as the Sarah Lancaster character, she deliberately mumbled into her tunic microphone---so realistic.  P G Croft  UK",1461369600,9,1224,4.735849056603773

7622419,5,B01B7TDH9I,"A bit hard to understand in certain parts with the thick British accents, but that is why we have subtitles.  Sarah Lancashire and James Norton will keep you watching-they both kill their roles.  Hope we see a Series 3 soon.",1491350400,3,224,4.575

As I look through other choices, whether new or used, there is no indication if the format is for region1-The US. I will pay more from Amazon Prime because I do not know of a less expensive one.

7622425,5,B01B7TDH9I,"Superb, all as good as the first season. Sarah Lancashire, in my opinion, is one of the best actors around. She can play any part she's handed and do it exceptionally well and most of all is true to life. All of the acting in this series as well as the first one was exceptionally well done. I've watched series 1 and 2 several times now and am still blown away every time by the story and events that happen. The BBC puts out nothing but high quality TV shows. This is one of the best!",1477612800,4,486,4.072916666666667

7622430,5,B01B7TDH9I,"Season 2 of Happy Valley (unfortunately, this could be the last) is as strong as season 1a don't miss for all fans of character-driven noir.  The cast is superb: Sarah Lancashire (Last Tango in Halifax); Siobhan Finneran (Downton Abbey), Kevin Doyle (Downton Abbey), James Norton (Grantchester), Shirley Henderson (the Harry Potter films), Amelia Bullmore (Scott and Bailey), et al.  The principal plot line (a serial killer is loose in the valley) is almost incidental; there are at least eight subplots (some intertwined) that emerge from the personal lives of the characters.  Rememberthis west Yorkshire valley is called happy because of the availability of drugs there.  The place is anything but happy; it is filled with individuals living on the edge, trying desperately to hold their lives together in the face of alcoholism, addiction, rape, murder, mutilation and mayhem.

There is one continuing set of stories that occur across 6 one-hour episodes.  I would advise viewers to set aside a single block of time, because you will want to see all of the episodes together.  Some of the plotlines: police sergeant Catherine Cawood is a (very remote) suspect in one of a set of serial rape/murders/mutilations because the victim is the mother of the man who attacked and impregnated her now dead (by suicide) daughter.  That man is now in prison but he is attempting to connect with his son and have his grandma (Catherine) murdered.  A policeman is having an affair with a bunny boiler who attempts to blackmail him when he tells her he wants to break up with her.  Catherines sister is struggling with her alcoholism and entertaining the thoughts of a new relationship with a troubled, damaged, but (it appears) fundamentally-decent man.  A neighbor who speaks Croatian is helping Catherine work with an east European woman who has been trafficked and, now free, may be targeted by the local mafia.  Catherine is sleeping in her conservatory (=unheated, glassed-in porch) to keep an eye on the neighbors adjoining home.  There is also some bullying, some incest and other unpleasantries.  Despite their complexity the stories are not difficult to follow.

What is hard to follow is the staccato dialogue.  You absolutely must have subtitles because the characters are not only speaking hundreds of words per minute, they are also speaking in the local dialect.  Since the American discs are not yet available, some are streaming the shows and some are using the British discs on their laptops.  I recommend the purchase of an all-regions player.  Amazon sells them for around $100; I have been very pleased with those made by Pioneer.  Once upon a time these were difficult to acquire, but no more.  They are also simple to use.  You pop in any discs, the machine reads them, the show begins.  Having an all-regions player enables you to get British shows before they are released in America and it enables you to comparison shop.  The Amazon.co.uk prices are often far lower than the Amazon.com prices.  It also enables you to see the show on a large screen where the subtitles are clear and legible.

Bottom line: Season 2 of Happy Valley is just as riveting and just as dark as season 1.  It is beautifully conceived and written (and, in several episodes, directed) by the first-rate British writer, Sally Wainwright.  I would not characterize it as entertainment because it is very dark and sometimes disturbing, but it is excellent television drama and for those who like their dramatic fare gritty, edgy and deeply human (with some very special lines and scenes), this is a must-see.",1466294400,5,3597,4.989932885906041
8749527,5,B01B7TDH9I,"Suspenseful, well acted by all. Can't wait for the concluding series to be available in the US. PBS already carried the conclusion in WA.",1537315200,,137,4.75
8749528,5,B01B7TDH9I,"Everything about this show is good...the location, the acting, the story line, etc.  I love that the characters are all believable and not selected because they have nice hair, perfect teeth or are height/weight proportionate.  The only thing I have trouble with--and this is on me--is the heavy, heavy British accent combined with the midrange tone of Sergeant Catherine Cawood's voice.  However, it is these nuances that make the show so good.  Can't wait for Season 3.",1522800000,,471,5.077922077922078
8749529,1,B01B7TDH9I,Why do they produce the first series of good shows available to play in region 1  and fail to do so for subsequent series??? It is such a waste of money to have the first one and not be able to follow up and purchase the following seasons.  I really liked season 1---- is that all I get?,1517011200,3,287,3.9310344827586206
8749530,5,B01B7TDH9I,"X'cellent series...Happy Valley is a bit darker than your ""regular"" police series and the writing /plot keeps you fearing concern and tension at every
change of scenery.  I kept saying throughout series one and two ,""Oh no, I am not sure I can watch this "".and then continue as I cannot take my eyes off the screen.
In series two , the camera does a fantastic job of quick ,second long flash backs , that fills in the story line and adds to the tension of the story line.
This is a wonderfully acted ,directed, written and filmed ""action intense"" series.
I am already looking for the 3/rd series.
I purchased an inexpensive DVD player from Amazon that plays all regions ;easy to ""hook up"" used the same existing cables from the previous player that only played region one ...well worth the price and allowance for purchasing ""any region"" DVD.",1512777600,2,842,4.613333333333333
