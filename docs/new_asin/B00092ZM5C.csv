8056848,3,B00092ZM5C,"The cast of SCTV was just as good as the Not Ready for Primetime Players on ""Saturday Night Live."" The SCTV cast included Catherine O'Hara (Home Alone); Eugene Levy (American Pie); Andrea Martin (My Big Fat Greek Wedding); Dave Thomas; Joe Flaherty; Harold Ramis (Ghost Busters) and others in the cast.

The episodes here include ""Southside Fracas"" aired on May 29, 1981 with musical guests, Southside Johnny and Asbury Jukes. This episode include ""Only for Women"" talk show with Andrea Martin and Catherine O'Hara; Dick Cavett interviewing himself; Ingmar Bergman film parody mixed into Count Floyd's ""Monster Horror Chiller Theater;"" ""Siskel & Ebery"" parody; the recurring ""Melvin and Howards"" with Howard Hughes, Howard Cosell; and ""Sid Dithers' Private Eye.""

The second episode is entitled ""The Sammy Muadlin Show; Bob Hope in China"" that aired on June 19, 1981 with sketches like ""Lee A. Iacocca's Rock Concert"" with Gino Vanelli, Ringo Starr MBE and Babra Streisand's duets with Slim Whitman and the fine British film, ""The Man Who Would Be King of the Popes"" with Peter O' Toole, Richard Burton CBE and Richard Harris (who also performs on ""Mel's Rock Pile).""

There is a DVD extra with the origins of SCTV with classic clips of Second City performances with insights from Eugene Levy, Bernard Sahlins, Del Close, Andrew Alexander, Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy and Dave Thomas. I just love satire and can't get enough of it. I wished that I had the entire collection. I bought this at a store.",1501891200,,1498,5.008032128514056

8056851,4,B00092ZM5C,"The SCTV crew did some of the best celebrity impressions, but my favorite here is the Bergman spoof ""Night Of The Wolf"". I find that some younger veiwers are not familiar with Dick Cavett and some of the other celebrities of that era. It is more fun if you are familiar with the person being impersonated. Everyone can enjoy the fictional cast that staffs SCTV in the episodes.",1123027200,2,377,4.5588235294117645
