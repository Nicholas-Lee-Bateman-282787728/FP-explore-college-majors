3175527,4,B0017UAXJK,"JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH
theasylum.cc  w/ Greg Evigan &  Dedee Pfeiffer

Sooo, This is a good movie(period).
I've enjoyed a lot of films from Theasylum peoples and this one seems to raise the bar, Congrats.
The special effects are amazing , Thanks to the co-directors being Special Effects Gods behind Tiny Juggernaut.
The cast is really something for a film ,You would have ill-thought guesses about.
  Greg Evigan is perfect for his heroic turn and never looked better in action.
Dedee Pfeiffer steals the humorous lines with a passion , She could do much more with another script like this one.
The two sets we are to believe in worked, The stuff on the burrowing vehicle just plain flowed and the team at Center Of Earth made you not even miss a male touch .
  The monsters were strong and REAL, Truly works of art to this Sci-Fi eye !",1214956800,5,849,4.509803921568627
3175528,1,B0017UAXJK,"This movie is split between the people stranded at the center of the earth and the people coming to rescue them.  Neither story is compelling.  The reasoning behind center of the earth is unexplained --- it just is.  No significance is given to any plot point or character, so I was not drawn into the movie.

A group of female soldiers is different, but the script lets the actors down.  Similarly, Dedee Pfieffer does not have much of a script to read, so her talents are wasted.  Even the monsters are cliched.

The commentary is revealing and honest.  If you have watched any Asylum films, then you know that these movies are filmed in a few weeks.  This movie had a challenge or two to overcome, and the crew and actors did so.  Unfortunately, the commentary more entertaining than the movie.",1278547200,,797,4.588652482269503
3175529,1,B0017UAXJK,"I see that one of the reviewers rated this as ""a good movie (period).""  I am convinced that that reviewer was an actor or producer or someone else involved with the film.  This isn't a ""borderline"" film.  It's truly bad.

The film starts out with one of those ""tough girl"" confrontations that makes every guy in the room cringe with ""oh come on!"" and just gets worse.  The lead actor (Greg Evigan, from BJ and the Bear fame apparently) has one of those grimacing looks that seems to be just a way to flash some teeth and model his goatee and 'stache.  The ""General"" (there's always one in these types of movies) sounds like he's reading his lines from a book, and Evigan's no better, except with that painful grimace-smile he has constantly.

The female soldiers are transported to the ""center of the earth"", which is a grassy field with clouds, and sky, and hills, and of course dinosaurs and waterfalls.  Evigan and the Pfeiffer chick who is supposed to be a brilliant scientist (and just happens to be his ex-wife) get there in a drilling thingamajig that she's invented.  And they're going after the female soldiers because one of the just happens to be his ex-wife's little sister.

This movie is so unbelievably stupid I can't believe I watched it.  Frankly, I did because it's one of those you start laughing at because you always think it reached it's low point, but it just keeps surprising.  Like when the ladies run across a little path across a river of lava - a path that's amazingly smooth and surrounded by cartooney lava (excuse me - ""cgi"" lava).  The only saving grace to this thing is that the brainy brunette is hot for some reason, but I don't think she's meant to be.  It's just that the ones that are supposed to be hot are such bad actors and their lines so bad and the MOVIE so bad that you keep wishing they'd just die in some interesting way.

This thing is so bad I can't possibly list everything wrong.  Saw this on cable.  If I had spent a buck on this movie at a rental kiosk, I'd be very VERY mad.",1271548800,,2028,4.423180592991914

Also, as far as soldiering goes, the ladies in sexy tanks tops was absolutely unbelievable and by that I mean the Salvation Army could do better in a situation like this.  If I were to see a T-Rex running around I would be wondering what other kind of wild animals were out there and I would not put only just ONE soldier on guard duty while everybody else slept.  Also, never ever divide your forces like the idiot captain girl did towards the end.  The idiot captain also fails to even check her own weapon for ammo.  Also how can a knife saw through the exoskeleton of a gigantic spider and being a comic book geek I remember Spiderman was supposed to have the equivalent strength of a human sized spider.  Combine these traits and they would have torn through human flesh like a chain saw.  And the sisters, I didn't see the resemblance at all.  I thought the blondie girl who burst at the end was the sister.  Also, no quarantine procedures after witnessing a person explode from the inside from a spider bite, contaminated water, pollen poisoning, eating dinosaur, all of the above?  Come on man!!!

Lastly the lead actress Dedee Pfeiffer and the earth drilling machine is nicknamed DEDE (or something close to that)?!?  Coincidence or is somebody a little too cozy with the director?

It does not, nor does it claim kinship with any other recognizable film.  The plot has been done before but in the James Mason version, one can see a vastly entertaining effort.  Even the Brandon Fraser version had its moments.  This one starts off badly and goes downhill from there.  Greg Evigan is a scientist who drives a bullet shaped earth drilling machine to rescue six attractive female soldiers who were teleported by mistake to an underground world 600 kilometers under the earth's surface--not quite the center of the earth but who's counting. The earth driller was lifted bodily from Edgar Rice Burroughs' AT THE EARTH'S CORE.  In Evigan's case, the earth's core looks remarkably like the Rockies.  No one bothered to raise the obvious question of why an underground area the size of Montana should resemble the surface in terms of sky, brightness, flora, and fauna. The stranded ladies encounter the expected prehistoric beasts, but their collective appearances are so shoddy that the audience cares little.  One of the ladies has issues with another.  Evigan has issues with his ex-wife who accompanies him in the earth driller.  And as far as audience connection to the cast that is it.  The ending is so silly as to deserve the vaunted title of celluloid moronic.  Jules Verne would turn over in his grave if he knew of this stinker.",1233964800,4,1477,4.840637450199203

The plot is a hodgepodge of other movies like Alien, The Core, and At the Earths Core.  It begins as so many films do, starting at the height of some unknown danger then abruptly stopping, to pull back to 30 minutes earlier.  This false start does not help an already fragmented story that they had the audacity to blame on poor dead Jules Verne.  Lets be perfectly clear, Jules had absolutely nothing to do with this mess.
As this plot would have it, a military research team is sent to Stuttgart by way of a shortcut, which strands them at the very center of the earth.  Their teleportation device malfunctions.  You know the military is involved because theres one (1) general onsite, continuously flipping a lighter.  Theres a metaphor in there somewhere.
The cinematographer literally gets up everyones nose.  The number of extreme closeups are frightening.  This is done of course so you don't pay attention to the cardboard boxes used as sets.  I still believe half of the actors were really sock puppets.

I think this film company should change its name to The Abysmal.  Its highly descriptive and ever so accurate.",1517529600,,1216,4.706161137440758

There just so happens to be a huge cavern there so they are fine. The good news is that they can transmit radio waves through 600 km. of rock and contact the surface. The bad news is that after they contact the surface, a T-Rex steps on their radio. The good news is that we just so happen to have a large laser machine that can dig through the earth and rescue them. The bad news is that T-Rex has developed a taste for people and they aren't that filling. By this point I was rooting for the T-Rex thing.

The film moves back and forth between a surface plot and subsurface subplot. There is faux personal drama created in both of them to keep us dis-interested in the whole film. I missed the pterodactyls on the cover.

Note to self: Never split up when ominous music is playing.

This is in no way connected to anything Jules Verne ever wrote, considered writing, or would have written if he was alive today.

8267310,2,B0017UAXJK,"Another day, another mockbuster movie from The Asylum.  This time, they released a movie called JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH to coincide with the big budget release for the Brendan Fraser movie of the same name.  Before we get started, lets let that sink in for a moment.  The Asylum is now making mockbusters based on Brendan Fraser movies.

Anyway, in this case, Greg Evigan is an Army officer in command of a team of women who have volunteered to be teleported to Germany as a trial run.  Unfortunately they wind up 600 kilometers below the earths surface, so Evigan enlists the aid of his ex-wife, Dedee Pfeiffer, who is a scientist who has developed a giant laser drill powerful enough to burrow through the earth to reach the team, the leader of which happens to be her sister.

The team, meanwhile, must navigate this strange new terrain that looks a whole lot like a grassy valley surrounded by mountains and try to survive attacks by dinosaurs and giant spiders.

After a series of close calls on the way down, the drill penetrates the sky of the underground world and they rescue their team--all except one, the blonde one, which seems appropriate since everyone else is brunette except Pfeiffer, and theres only room for one blonde in this movie at a time, so somebody got to die.

Greg Evigan has brought with him a homing beacon which can link back to the teleporter and before you know it, zap, they're back at base.

Ive been putting off watching this one for a few days, knowing it was coming, but not wanting to dive in too quickly.  Im familiar enough with the original Jules Verne classic that I wasn't intrigued enough by the story to wonder what it was about and need to see it in order to satisfy that curiosity.  Seeing the stars were Greg Evigan and Dedee Pfeiffer, I wasn't intrigued enough by the cast to need to see how they did.  Seeing it was an Asylum movie, I certainly wasn't intrigued enough to need to see how spectacular and impressive the special effects were.  If anything, it was sheer morbid curiosity as to just how bad this movie would be that intrigued me.

And it was pretty bad.  The acting is wooded while the scientific jargon is just confusing enough to sound plausible.  The action scenes were muddled and uninteresting while the romantic subplot between Evigan and Pfeiffer was predictable from the first frame.  Its standard operating procedure in movies like this where the male and female leads used to be married; by movies end, they're going to be back together.  For me, personally, a more interesting twist would have been if they had remained hating each other to the end.

Screenwriter Steve Bevilacqua has just enough of these movies under his belt--WAR OF THE WORLDS 2: THE NEXT WAVE, SUPERCROC, HAMMER OF THE GODS--to know the formula and to know how to rattle off a bunch of gobbledygook that may or may not be scientifically accurate.  As for direction, this incarnation of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH was co-directed by Davey Jones (who has no other credits) and Scott Wheeler (who has only 6, other titles including TRANSMORPHERS: FALL OF MAN and AVALANCHE SHARKS, so make of that what you will), and for both of them this was their first time at the helm.  Honestly, I cant tell if that inexperience shows or not, because everything else here was just so bad too.

The effects were so unconvincing it was difficult to feel any suspense when the spiders or dinosaurs were attacking, and the acting also so unconvincing I wouldnt have believed it if the effects had been top notch.

There were just no redeeming qualities about this movie, unless what you're looking for specifically is a bad movie.  In that case, you can stop searching, because the 2008 Asylum version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is exactly what you're looking for.",1386806400,2,3821,4.651785714285714

Second, the Center of the Earth has plenty of blue sky. That is easy to tell because about every two minutes the director makes sure to cut in a shot straight up into the trees. Evidently this ""builds tension"".

Another favorite camera technique is quick cuts in and out of close up, and then circling the actor/actress in even more jerky quick cuts. Evidently this ""builds tension"".

8267314,3,B0017UAXJK,"Boy, was this movie an educational experience. I learned:

1) When you assemble a military group to participate in a mission involving teleportation, make sure they're all good looking women in tight tank tops. (Well, tank tops are part of the military wardrobe, aren't they?)

2) When the sound department screws up on the audio to where the background noise muffles the dialogue (in this case, during the ""burrowing deep into the earth"" scenes), you're probably not missing much when it's Greg Evigan and Dedee Pfeiffer doing the talking.

3) The center of the earth doesn't have much in the way of magma, but rather a seemingly similar environment to, say, a national park in the U.S. Only with dinosaurs, weird plants and giant spiders. Otherwise, an ideal vacation spot.

4) When your soldiers are mistakenly teleported to the center of the earth instead of Germany, always be prepared and have already in your possession machinery capable of going through 600 kilometers worth of crust, magma and the occassional void. Even when this problem was never conceived.

5) When films like this claim to be ""based"" on, in this case, the Jules Verne classic novel of the same name, they always conveniently leave out the word ""loosely"" in front of it.

And lastly, a horribly asinine and inept movie can always be forgiven if also providing a compensating amount of unintentional belly laughs. 5/10",1291593600,4,1396,4.944444444444445
