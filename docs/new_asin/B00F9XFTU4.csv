5972633,1,B00F9XFTU4,I haven't the words to fully express the piece of crap this movie is. I've had more fun watching paint dry. We thought we had paid for a mystery-thriller. The only mystery of it was when would it be over and the thrill came when it finally did. I had a glimmer of hope in the beginning... it was just gas.,1386892800,6,305,4.016393442622951
8613530,2,B00F9XFTU4,"I don't know if this review has plot spoilers or not, because I don't know if I understand what this was about. However I will at the end supply you with what I consider to be my explanation of the film for those who did watch it and are still scratching their head.

Paul (John Savage) owns a warehouse. His driver is out and his stepson (?) Clyde (Brendan Sexton III) who he has fired is sitting there. Recently a co-worker died from...? being in the street?  Paul asks Clyde to go to NYC to tend to Kate (Ella Lentini) which the DVD cover claims was a ""younger cousin"", although I don't know if any family relationship was established other than Paul claims his family ""is a mess.""

Kate's roommate Rob was recently killed and she is traumatized. She didn't know Rob as a boyfriend, he was just a roommate. Kate is taking meds and sleeps all the time. Clyde has odd flashbacks or dreams. His head is not on straight. There are two guys in the apartment building who have a keen interest in Kate. Sam is an older man who has issues getting over his wife being killed and raped. Rich has a thing for Kate and may or may not be her boyfriend.

Clyde finds photos of a woman named Sadie (Florencia Lozano)  and speculates on Rob's (Anthony Ordonez) relationship with her as a newspaper article with the photos claims she was murdered. Rob plays detective in her case, which adds to his creep factor.

Yes, the story ends without an explanation to tie things together...or does it?

Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Ella Lentini)

MY PLOT SPOILER EXPLANATION: The last scene with Sam attacking Rich was the key. Sam apparently believed Rob was the man that killed his wife and Sam was the one that killed Rob who may or may not have been his wife's or Sadie's killer. Sam thought the same thing about Rich. He most assuredly thought the same about Rob.",1446422400,2,1845,4.454005934718101

8613533,1,B00F9XFTU4,A waste of 3.99. The ending didn't explain anything.  Boring.,1410652800,,61,5.1
8613534,4,B00F9XFTU4,It starts out well but then skids into near-average territory.  It's not as bad as others would have you believe if you like independent films.  These guys aren't working with budgets so they try their best.,1406678400,,207,4.722222222222222
8613535,2,B00F9XFTU4,It was boring it ended poorly. It felt as though they just were running out of time. Nothing really happens,1392768000,,107,4.4
8613536,5,B00F9XFTU4,"Teddy Schenck directs a slow-burn mystery that feels a heat-stroke hallucination. Brendan Sexton III really delivers here, and James Russo brings it to the table.",1391731200,,162,5.52
8613537,1,B00F9XFTU4,"We know this troubled kid is asked by a man who raised him to watch over the daughter of that said man's wife after something traumatic happens to her roommate....we NEVER find out what happened, how it happened, self inflicted or murder? The kid watching her has significant problems we never find out what...something about the girl's mother being a liar, something about a friend of his dying in the street, something about a girl named Sade who might have been killed by a serial raper, who might of also killed another man's wife in the building? Is it all connected, who the heck knows. Then ends with them walking down a street happy. Are you confused? I certainly don't know what I just watched!! Trust me I haven't spoiled the movie by telling you this...go into the movie knowing that this is all you will come out of it with and maybe you'll see something the other 3 reviewers and I certainly missed!!!",1388620800,8,914,4.579268292682927
8613538,1,B00F9XFTU4,Do not waste your money. If there was a rating lower than one star this would get it. Absolute waste of time.,1388448000,4,109,4.0
8613539,5,B00F9XFTU4,Life is like that. No answers.  Oh wow!  We just do the best we can but once in a while real life invades our sphere. We don't like it but it is true.  Kudos to Teddy Schenck.  Kudos to Brendan.  Ouch and keep on trucking,1388275200,2,221,3.8222222222222224
