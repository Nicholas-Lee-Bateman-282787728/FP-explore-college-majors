3466574,4,B001AS9714,"This is getting to be my standard review.  Another great series, that could have gone on much longer; at least they closed out most of the story lines they left room so it might have made a come back with them trying to move around and keep thier secret but all in all the main story was completed in the ending and gave decent closure to the series much better than many other series we've seen that just end and leave you hanging as to what happened.  Again good SciFi and several good romantic interest stories a good blending of the two.",1327795200,4,541,4.294117647058823
3466575,5,B001AS9714,"We watched some of these when they were on TV, but had missed many episodes over the 3 years, so now we are enjoying watching ALL of the episodes and in the order they were broadcast. And it is good to see so many of these actors and actresses have gone on to bigger and better things.",1297641600,,285,4.017543859649122
3466576,5,B001AS9714,"My only complaint with this series is that it ended too soon! Three seasons wasn't quite enough. I felt very invested in these characters and what happened to them. This is a great series. I watched the first time it ran and bought it to watch with my daughters who are totally addicted.
Enjoy and be warned that it is an addictive treat!",1277683200,17,338,4.380952380952381
3466577,5,B001AS9714,"I had great fun revisiting the series. The stories are engrossing and entertaining. I have laughed and cried while watching them. The romance between Max and Liz is played just right --- as is the banter between Michael and Maria.

In my opinion, the set is worth buying. I'm glad I did.",1265846400,3,287,4.519230769230769
3466578,5,B001AS9714,I ordered this item just about a week before Christmas.  I was very happy that it arrived on time per the seller's promised date and it came in great condition.  My daughter absolutely loves Roswell!!!,1265760000,4,201,4.714285714285714

3466580,5,B001AS9714,I absolutely love this series. I was kind of sad that they only had 3 seasons but I wasn't too disappointed in the way that they chose to end it. Most endings suck and you want more. Not that I didn't want more but I was pretty content with the way things ended. 8),1260316800,5,265,3.925925925925926
3466581,5,B001AS9714,This is a great series all brought together in one set.  The set includes 17 single disk in 9 slim cases.  The slim sets are great for traviling.  This is a great seies and a joy to watch.,1260057600,6,188,3.8947368421052633

8279377,4,B001AS9714,"We were given 'Presto' with Telstra for six months as a freebie and this was in the package.  I just finished watching the last episode last night.  I am 40 and I found this quite compelling.  Yes it is clearly set for teens, but it is also engaging enough to keep the older audience and is family friendly with no swearing or indecent/lewd behaviour.  I have not seen the books as yet, though I have read that they differ greatly from the series which came about afterward.  I love the theme song with the beginning credits and it suits the main characters very well.  As I have not bought the dvds I cannot review this aspect, but the series itself - wow.",1433635200,,657,4.344262295081967

8279382,5,B001AS9714,"What if an interstellar ship crashes releasing alien-human hybrid orphans adopted as human? What problems will they face while growing up? What will become of those people that discover the secret? What would you do in the situations?

There are a few episodes that experiment with same actors playing different characters, and many of the other experiments we see with series today.

This was a lot of fun to watch as a 2684 minute marathon form start to stop. After the last episode, that wrapped the story up better than most series, you keep waiting for the movies franchise to take over. Waiting, waiting waiting ...

I am going about this backwards and now plan to read the series.

8279384,5,B001AS9714,I liked this show and I wanted all the seasons on DVD. They never show it on TV so it's nice to have it available whenever I want to watch it.,1356393600,,142,3.6129032258064515
8279385,5,B001AS9714,"I just happened across this series by accident it was fantastic. A new series would be great, what is happening in their lives, did they ever get back home. Bring the series back to life but only with the original actors or it won't work. Adults love this series also not just teens.",1340409600,5,283,4.3584905660377355
