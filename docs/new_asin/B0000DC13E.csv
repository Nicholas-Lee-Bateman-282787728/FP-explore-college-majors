1922496,5,B0000DC13E,"This DVD deserves 5 stars from my perspective. The menu's could have been better and if the sound had been remixed in 5.1 surround instead of being left in stereo it would have been truly incredible, however these are minor nit picky complaints.
The amount of content provided, the interviews, rare clips, full line of videos, easter eggs, and the super low price of $14 makes it appear Clarke and Bell just wanted to give their fans a terrific comprehensive DVD set without overcharging.
I can't think of any other band with a similar history and number of good songs that has a released a collection of this type and charged so little as Erasure.
The Pop 20 VHS tape - $20. Erasure concert tickets - $50+. Over 5 hours of music videos, live concert performance and interviews on 2 DVD's for $14. Priceless.
Some of their videos are on the strange/homo erotic side and should be avoided by anyone uncomfortable with their sexuality. Others are just artistic, interesting, and funny. The concert footage brings back good memories if you attended Erasure Live shows.
Erasure represents one of the best examples of Euro synth pop music and their original songs and tribute remakes are just incredibly well done.
This has to be one of the best purchases I have made for my DVD collection and worth every cent. My hat's off to Erasure and thank them for this release.",1068854400,7,1363,4.707112970711297
1922497,4,B0000DC13E,"if you enjoyed 80s synth this is for you. I have dropped a star because the menu navigation is one of the worst. You cant really tell where you are but at this price to get 35 videos and 15 extras plus some easter eggs on the 2nd dvd how can you go wrong. Even if just for A LITTE RESPECT (on of the 80s best pop songs) or Erasures ABBA tribute videos, or even their semi comeback 97 hit IN MY ARMS. Andys great voice brings back great 80s memories.

There is really not much absent from this DVD, although I would have been pleased if the package contained an order form for purchasing memorabilia or something. Nevertheless, at any price, I would had still ran to the store to get this awesome release. The videos are at times embarrasing, especially ""Take a chance on me"", ""Oh L'amour"", and ""Solsbury Hill.""

You get all of Erasure's music videos from ""Who Needs Love Like That?"" to the latest ""Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me).""  Treasures to be found include the ""Rain"" music video, which uses footage from the San Francisco show for the 1997 Cowboy Tour....footage was that intended to be another concert video, but was never released.
Other gems include various live performances from concert tours of the past and mini-documentaries about Erasure's past releases.
U.S. Erasure fans in the past, usually had difficulties tracking down these videos because either the VHS tape is out of print, or it isn't in NTSC format. But now it's going to all be on 2-dvds and everyone's anticipating its release.",1064534400,10,927,4.860759493670886
1922503,5,B0000DC13E,"While many may be familiar with Erasure's music, their videos are likely another story.  Receiving little or no airplay on US music video channels at the time of release, Erasure's videos tend to be narrative in nature, opting in many cases for storytelling over mere images of the band.  Fairy tales are a recurring theme.  As a result, a collection of Erasure videos is much easier to watch over an extended period of time.  This collection provides an affordable way for old and new fans to discover that Erasure's talents extend beyond the recording studio.  Additional interviews and appearances will be a welcome treat for long-time fans, in particular.",1064361600,4,659,5.009174311926605

1922520,3,B0000DC13E,"As a big-time Erasure fan in the U.S. it's obvious that I have NEVER gotten to see ANY Erasure videos, save for Chains of Love.  I was very anxious for this DVD for two reasons...1) because half the music on the DVD wasn't on the correlating CD and should have been, and 2) I was very anxious to see the vision and brilliance inherent in their music translated to the big screen.  So hence the mediocre review.  The music is outstanding, but you already knew that, otherwise you'd have no interest in the DVD, but the videos are in a word: awful.  There is absolutely no story-telling, just truly bad concepts (even post 80's), bad lip-syncking, and a common theme.  Now, I love Vince Clark and Andy Bell, but just watching them stand around and sing and dance 40-something straight times doesn't do it for me.  I also don't want to sound homophobic, but some of the videos are so loaded with gay themes that it did turn me off a few times, and it's tough to watch among friends who don't really know the music, but can appreciate the imagery.  I'm not and have never been a fan of half-naked girls glamming it up in videos, but on that same note, I'm not a huge fan of drag queens, flambouyant men, and outward men hanging around in thongs.  I love Erasure for their music, and after watching this DVD, it's going to stay that way.  If you're an American who has never been able to appreciate Erasure in concert or on TV than you may be turned off by the DVD, but if you enjoy low-budget, repeated themes, and outright campiness, then you should enjoy this.  Form your own opinions.",1103068800,11,1583,4.40893470790378

1922522,4,B0000DC13E,"Most of these videos have that horribly dated eighties look to them. The remainder are OK. I only wish the videos for ""Fingers and Thumbs' and ""Rock Me Gently"" would have been made using  the album versions used, not the edited single versions. Whomever mixed the single versions absolutely BUTCHERED the originals, in favour of slightly shorter mixes of these two songs. Otherwise a nice DVD. I like the video for Rain, as it is a different mix from the album version. I just contradicted myself. Whatever. If you like Erasure, pick this up. There's a great extra disc of interviews, concert stuff, promo things, etc etc.",1095897600,2,622,4.813084112149533
1922523,5,B0000DC13E,"This outstanding two-disc DVD set released in 2003 is really a must-have for Erasure fans.  Disc one contains thirty-five videos presented in chronological order (though one can of course ""play all"" or pick and choose which videos to watch).  It commences with Who Needs Love Like That from 1985's debut album, Wonderland, and includes all twenty videos that were on 1992's Pop! VHS (for those unfamiliar with the VHS, it's the same track listing that's on the Pop! CD).  It includes all four videos from Abba-esque and twleve videos from the albums Erasure has done since Pop!.  For those interested, the final twelve videos are:  Always, Run To The Sun, and I Love Saturday (from I Say I Say I Say); Stay With Me, Fingers & Thumbs, and Rock Me Gently (from Erasure); In My Arms, Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me, and Rain (from Rain); Freedom (from Loveboat); and Solsbury Hill and Make Me Smile (from Other People's Songs).
Disc two is loaded with extra features, and is every bit as enjoyable disc one.  There are six promo ""documentaries"" made at the time of release of six of Erasure's albums.  The ""documentaries"" are actually interviews with Vince Clarke and Andy Bell with clips of videos or live performances interspersed.  The oldest interview is from 1991 (ostensibly to promote Chorus and clocking in at 24 minutes), and it is the only one not to include Andy.  The next are from 1992 (Pop! at 30 minutes), 1994 (I Say I Say I Say at 26 minutes), 1995 (Erasure at 15 minutes), 1997 (Cowboy at 4 minutes), and 2003 (Hits! at 27 minutes).  The 2003 interview is the only one not to include any video/performance clips.  In the interviews, Vince and Andy talk about everything from their song writing, to their views on making videos and touring, to how they teamed up, to their personalities and their relationship with each other, and so on.  Personally, I really enjoyed the interviews and am grateful to have them on this set.
Disc two also includes their debut performance of Sometimes on the UK's Top of the Pops from 1986; two alternate videos (an acoustic version of Solo Luminous, and a US version of In My Arms); a video from 1990 promoting Aids awareness; and live performances of five songs from five tours (Leave me to Bleed from 1987, A Little Respect from 1988, Supernature from 1989, Waiting for the Day from 1992, and Fingers & Thumbs from 1996).  I've never seen Erasure live, and so really appreciated the inclusion of a few clips from their live tours.  They've obviously put on some spectacular shows, and Andy has some wild costumes (Vince has his moments too!).  It's an aspect of Erasure that one really doesn't get to see much of in the videos, and I think a lot of fans (myself included!) would love to see one of their concerts filmed for DVD release.
Finally, there are two bonus ""hidden"" clips on disc two.  In the ""Interview"" section, press the left arrow and one of the background silhouettes becomes highlighted.  Click enter and it plays a live performance Wooden Heart (the old Elvis song).  In the ""Rare Videos"" section, press the right arrow and click enter for an alternate version of Oh L'Amour.  Lastly, if you press the up arrow (and enter) whilst on the main menu, it plays the standard version of Who Needs Love Like That.
In conclusion, I highly, highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who enjoys the gorgeous, feel-good music of this outstanding, enormously talented British pop duo.  It's definitely a collection to be watched and rewatched.  I hope these guys will continue to make music for a long time yet--and that they will continue to release DVDs of videos, interviews and live performances in the future for those of us in North America who would otherwise never have a chance to see any of this material!",1080518400,26,3770,4.699088145896656
1922524,5,B0000DC13E,"Other reviewers have mentioned the ""bad"" videos, and believe me there are plenty. Part of it was stiff resistence on the part of Vince Clarke, who saw them as a waste of money and a necessary evil.  Part it it undoubtedly was a limited budget- I'm sure they never had a million dollars to spend on any video, like Madonna or Missy Elliott.  Still, many of us grew up with Erasure.  They gave words/lyrics to our feelings, and lifted us up when needed.  So, bad videos aside, this comprehensive DVD collection is well worth buying.
There are plenty of good videos scattered throughout the first DVD.  The first two, Who Needs Love Like That? and Heavenly Action, are campy and rather amateur, but are still very charming.  Sometimes, even with its cluttered camera angles, is memorable for Andy Bell dancing in the rain.  Other early favorites of mine include It Doesn't Have to Be, Ship of Fools, and A Little Respect.  Starting with Chorus, the videos seem to be a little more ""polished.""  After scoring some moderate pop success, they no doubt got bigger budgets for their videos.  In Chorus, seeing Andy Bell in a sea of sunflowers, dressed in overalls, is wonderful.  Love to Hate You also has a great scene of Andy marching with some flamenco dancers, clapping his hands.  The two other videos from the Chorus album are also good.  Am I Right is beautifully shot in black and white.  Andy really does seem to emote what he is singing, making you wonder how autobiographical the song is. Breath of Life is a spin on Alice in Wonderland...who can forget those girls dancing in circles, dressed as oysters?
From the Abba-esque EP, there are two good videos, and two duds.  Others here complain about Take a Chance on Me, but I think it's brilliant.  For once, Vince really gets ""into"" the video, instead of looking zombified...I guess it had to be ""dragged"" out of him, lol.  Besides, after that, he's missing from most of the videos.  Likewise, Lay All Your Love on Me features Little Red Riding Hood finding Snow White poisoned by the apple.  Andy and Vince, dressed in gold lame, arrive on golden motorcyles to help her. The riding through the forest is reminiescent of Star Wars.  The duds are Voulez-Vous (too dizzy), and S.O.S., which is marred by jittery camera angles, not to mention that by then videos shot in houses was really becoming a cliche for Erasure.
From the rest of the collection, my favorites are the oriental-themed Always, the wonderfully shot Run to the Sun, I Love Saturday (Andy looks tasteful instead of campy/trashy, for a change), Fingers and Thumbs, which is set in a carnival park, and Rain (a live video, with the crowd really getting into it.
A special mention should be made for Rock Me Gently.  Another reviewer here gripes about not ""getting"" why Erasure did a video about Marilyn Monroe.  I strongly disagree.  Shot in sepia tones, it is a touching tribute to one of the greatest icons in cinema.  The tragedy of her premature death still haunts Hollywood.  It was very brave of Andy to dress up like Marilyn, and the ""special effects"" they used on his face make him look almost like the real thing, really flooring you when you hear ""Marilyn"" sing lines like, ""And there's more to life than thrills, and spills, and dollar bills.""  Marilyn is every gay man's saint, and this video does well by her.  Bravo, Erasure.
As for the really bad videos, my top three picks for real stinkers are 1) Oh L'Amour- Andy is drenched from head to toe in sweat, wearing a kind of wife-beater and old-man white shorts, with socks to match...for this reason, I also hate the Leave Me to Bleed live clip...thank God there is the ""hidden"" European video, where at least Andy isn't sweating; 2) Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me- what an awful concept, Andy being dragged around on a carpet; and 3) In My Arms- one of my favorite songs, and they had to ruin it by putting out this bluish/greenish live clip that looks all too much like the videos for Victim of Love and Chains of Love.
Solsbury Hill is in a special, awful catagory of its own...Andy is too old by now to be working that tired drag!
As for the second DVD, the interviews are let-downs. Granted, I haven't seen them all, but at least three of them go on and on about the formation of Erasure, and why they don't like to make videos, etc. They don't actually discuss much about the respective album being promoted!!!  The live clips are a mixed bag...only Waiting for the Day really stands out. I wish they had included a live clip of Heart of Stone, one of their best non-singles. From the bonus videos, Too Darn Hot isn't well sung by Andy, but it is an important public service annoucement for a disease that is still ravaging the human race.
Sorry to have gone on for so long, but there really is much to cover here!!!",1078963200,10,4806,4.576429404900817

1922546,4,B0000DC13E,"As with The Pet Shop Boys ""Popart"" dvd, Erasure's ""Hits"" dvd gets four stars because they were not good at making videos. I have been a fan since ""Chains Of Love"" in 1988 and have collected all of their albums, but they were not a great video duo. That's not to say that some of their videos aren't great--take ""Blue Savannah"" and ""Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me)"", both have interesting concepts and are well done. However, too many of the videos seemed ill conceived. Despite this, this collection is extremely thorough and offers more than you could ask for as a fan. 35 videos, 4 bonus videos and 5 live performances plus 6 promotional documentaries all for a nice price. The only thing that would have been nice was if all the videos were in 5.1 dolby digital which they are not. They are digitally remastered in 2.0 which sounds great, but it's not as good as 5.1.

1922551,5,B0000DC13E,"""Hits! The Videos"" is the definitive Erasure DVD, giving you music videos and MUCH more.  Fans of this synth duo will find lots to enjoy on both these discs.  On the first DVD, we get the duo's ENTIRE (and I mean ""entire"") video history, from their debut ""Who Needs Love Like That"" right up to 2003's ""Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me).""  In all, 35 videos are featured on this disc in 2-channel surround stereo.  While they're not big budget extravaganzas, the videos of Erasure are pure exercises in maximum level camp.  The one video that had me howling is their cover of ABBA's ""Take a Chance on Me"" with the duo prancing around in front of the camera in drag.  That clip is so flaming, it will melt your screen.  Other favorites include ""Blue Savannah,"" ""Fingers and Thumbs,"" and ""Love to Hate You."" But the real treat for fans is on disc 2, which has live performances, rare videos, and documentaries promoting their last six albums.  It's a real treat watching Vince and Andy bring down their guard as they discuss touring, making videos, music, and their songwriting.  These clips, ranging from 5 minutes to half an hour, bring additional value to an already great DVD.  It would have been nice if these videos were in 5.1 surround sound and had petter picture quality, but ""Hits! The Videos"" is still a must-buy for any Erasure fan.  While ""Hits!"" the CD was a halfhearted collection that left out many of the duo's singles, ""Hits!"" the DVD features every video they made right up to 2003's ""Other People's Songs.""  It's the perfect replacement for your worn-out VHS copy of ""Pop!""",1068940800,11,1591,4.622775800711744

It was everything and more than I expected.",1426809600,,169,4.3125
8000464,5,B0000DC13E,This is pretty much the complete music video works of Erasure. The publisher also added some extras such as concert footage.  Overall it had far more material than I was expecting.,1399680000,,180,4.806451612903226

8000467,5,B0000DC13E,This was a perfect complement to the CD version of Erasure's greatest hits.  All the video are looking great on DVD.  We grew up in an area with out cable so I was able to 'catch up' on a bunch of videos I missed back in the day (which was a Thursday if I'm not mistaken).  Great purchase!,1375488000,,289,3.9482758620689653
8000468,5,B0000DC13E,"I love Erasure - and after reading review by Tiggah - I was basically forced to buy this DVD.  Am I glad I did.  This 2 disc set was well worth the money I spent.  I've only owned for over a week & have watched 3 times already (including the interviews).  Any fans of Erasure who don't own this dvd are really missing out on something quite special.  My only issue is -- it doesn't contain one video (I Could Fall in Love With You) but I knew that when I purchased this DVD.  I highly recommend this DVD.  I sincerely hope this review will influence somebody else who is a fan to live frivolously - buy this DVD set.  You'll be happy you did.

8000469,5,B0000DC13E,"The 2 DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erasure-Hits-The-Videos/dp/B0000DC13E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erasure - Hits! The Videos</a>, is an awesome collection of music videos and live performances that has to be a must own for all fans who don't already have it.  In a day where music videos rarely get played on music channels (unless you have extra music channels above basic cable), this set gives you hours of funny videos and great music.

I'm surprised by some who have said the videos were not as good as the music.  I am not the biggest fan of Erasure (actually originally bought this as a gift for somebody else), but along with a lot of hit songs I found these videos to be very funny and fun to watch.  There's also plenty of live clips and other cool extras.

Definitely for the amount of content you get, this is a great value.  For less than $20 you get HOURS of music videos, live performances and extras.  And if you're like me and didn't catch all these videos the first time around, it's awesome to have them all collected in one place for a quick education.

The interviews and extra performances are also nice extras.  The only minor con is that when this DVD was made, multi-channel sound mix formats were not standards for DVD.  So while this won't include 5.1 and 7.1 formats, just having all this music together at this price makes this a deal.

Check this out if you don't own it already.

Enjoy.",1214179200,2,1474,4.875502008032129
8000470,5,B0000DC13E,Totally awesome for the Erasure fan.  Great collection.  The videos start off cheesy as hell from the 80's but end up with some of their latest hits.  Binh Nguyen from Seattle is a true fan of this DVD!!,1168300800,,203,4.2894736842105265
