I stumbled upon it on Hulu and fell in love with the island scenery, the murder mysteries and especially the chemistry between the two main characters.  I can't find anyplace where I can watch this/buy it online but I'd be more than willing to buy the DVDs from you.
However, do these have English subtitles as an option?  Also, would they work on an American DVD player? If the seller or previous buyers could get back to me with these answers, I'd happily purchase them. Thank you!",1523059200,,513,4.565217391304348

Swedish noir can be a little heavy at times.  This new series, 'The Sandhamn Murders' gives us a new take on this beautiful  island in the Stockholm archipelago.

The Sandhamn Murders Finds Nora Linde, played by Alexander Rapaport, with her family as summer residents in Sandhamn.  While swimming one morning she finds a corpse wrapped up in a fishing net. The island is covered by the city police and Thomas Andreasson, played by Jakob Cedergren, is sent To investigate. Coincidentally, he and Nora went to the same school, and an instant attraction begins.

As the investigation proceeds, there is another death, linking to the first murdered man. Thomas and his colleague cannot find much evidence until Nora gives them some clues. Of course, mischief and mayhem ensues.  Nora becomes too invo,fed in the case and danger befalls.

All in all I found this series a little disappointing. Action is slow, writing is so-so. The characters are predictable, romance comes and goes. However, there is enough interest to look at the second series.
