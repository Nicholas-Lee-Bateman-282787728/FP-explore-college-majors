8533807,5,B000EMGF7Q,"Episode 20 is missing and is replaced with Fyana from STAGE 1 .... which is like the second to last episode on the second disc of that set. Anyway Votoms is awesome real life combat with a great story. Not that cutie typical anime crap they make now. They don't even stick in laser weaponry here. There is one gun that takes forever to charge that shoots lasers just to make it half useless to weild for realitys sake. Chirico is a great character who is tough and doesent say much... Who wants to listen to another Amuro or Camile all day long? (UC Gundam series still rock!) The mech, the VOTOMS are very realistic and not cheesey like big bright colored Gundams from series that came out the past 20 years. The only downfall I see is there is hardly any blood... lol ... Lots of killing just not lots of blood. Votoms is the greatest anime I have seen or heard of ... Dougram Gundam Macross Dorvack pale in comparison! Get the real mech warfare series go with AT-VOTOMS!",1317945600,,973,4.3812154696132595
8533808,5,B000EMGF7Q,"This is the second arc in the VOTOMS saga. Our heroes have escaped Uoodo city and now find themselves on a jungle planet, overall this is a good arc and very reminiscent of Gundam the 08th MS team in terms of setting.",1153699200,,217,4.190476190476191
