Otherwise, the tape was in great condition.",1518307200,,242,4.454545454545454
7813654,5,6301562917,"This is the most entertaining display of dunks and bloopers of all time.  From the history of the dunk contest to Jeff Reuhlin taking home the gold in the javelin.  And who can leave out the Supersonics guard who crotched that layup.  These clips never get old.  With Marv Albert and Frank Layden doing the commentary, this is a must have for all blooper fans.  If nothing else, the soundtrack will stick with you for a lifetime.",1015804800,,429,4.51948051948052
