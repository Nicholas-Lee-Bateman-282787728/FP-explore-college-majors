8670780,5,B00M8O8UCQ,This is exceptionally good curriculum and these videos are very helpful and well done. I teach Nance's Logic (both Introductory and Intermediate Logic) at a Classical Christian School and I love the way the material is laid out. You can start with exactly zero knowledge of Logic and step by step be led to doing some fairly advanced stuff within two years of material. I heartily recommend this curriculum to teachers and homeschool families alike. The videos will be indispensable for parents of homeschoolers that don't have a logic background.,1486512000,5,547,5.088888888888889

8670782,5,B00M8O8UCQ,"The new edition is much more user friendly and the graphics are up to date. You won't waste video time watching the instructor write on his whiteboard--he's got a digital one now. The program is basic enough for a bright 6th grader, but contains lots of meaty content so that it can satisfy a high schooler needing a good beginning with traditional logic. I would not try to use or teach the program without the dvds (they contain thorough instruction not found in the workbook) unless you're already a competent logician.",1453248000,12,522,4.747252747252747
