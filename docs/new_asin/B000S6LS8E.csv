2881662,1,B000S6LS8E,"it may be a great story, but we couldn't get through more than 10 minutes because the video quality was so horrible.  And the gorilla was so unrealistic.",1453420800,,153,4.464285714285714

2881666,4,B000S6LS8E,"This was listed as a comedy. I disagree. I liked it as a heartwarming story which deals with saving an endangered species of gorilla. Good action, teaches people to understand animal's rights and sensible solutions. Killing is a last resort.",1433721600,2,241,5.05

2881681,2,B000S6LS8E,"I don't like this ridiculous and ludicrous film for one primary reason: Silverbacks and other biped creatures are first trained then used to make profit. Nice story? Why? So you can see for yourself and your precious kids that mankind is the most cruel species on earth? Do we need reminders of that reality?  This gorgeous beast has been taught how to ""behave"" before a camera...I would challenge the trainer to reveal his/her methodology, much less purpose.  The film producers, actors, writers, directors, and trainers just don't want to make mock of this effort to entertain mindless Americans whose tolerances assure them of success...only because it's a gimmick.  For shame, using this SB's ""lab-created, installed by repetition, learned-by-rote tricks"" to compel them to perform on cue. This is abusive to the breed, only a simpleton would find this SB's antics amusing.  Here is a lesson up close, but never too personal,  about true cruelty to animals.",1426982400,2,961,5.134615384615385
