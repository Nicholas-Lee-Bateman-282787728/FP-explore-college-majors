8374816,1,B002N8AQL0,The quality of this film is very bad as all of the spaghetti western movies i have bought from amazone. I would like to know the reason for this.,1506038400,,145,4.0344827586206895
8374817,1,B002N8AQL0,"Very amateurishly produced disc. The menu is the default from cheap DVD burning software. Worse yet, the transfer is from an old VHS cassette. Not true widescreen, but standard def with letterbox bars on top and bottom. Avoid unless you have a strong desire to see this film, which is a run-of-the-mill badly-dubbed spaghetti western. Trailer is dubbed in German.",1416441600,,363,5.066666666666666
8374818,4,B002N8AQL0,"Also known as the ""You die...but I live"", this is an above average Spaghetti Western directed by Massimo Dallamano (""Max Dillman"") in 1967. My standard for this statement assumes Leone's three westerns acted by Clint Eastwood are at the top. So, if you like this genre of Westerns, you should try this one. It has all features for an entertaining movie, including a good story of preview friendship, betrayal, aim for vengeance, and a stranger that gets in the middle. Of course, you have to add a good amount of people being shot.

Technically, I have not major complaints (except for one may be, see below), but please note this product recorded on demand. My copy came in a nice color, very widescreen format. I noted though that this version may have been cut a few minutes. There is one scene in which a prostitute visits our hero into his saloon room, but it ends rather abruptly. Then, the movie runs for 91 min, but IMDB states it should do so for 95 min. So, very likely it should be some missing footage somewhere. Audio is in English with no subtitles. The only extra is the trailer, which is spoken in German though. In my view, this movie deserves a Blu-ray edition.",1416096000,,1179,4.561320754716981
8374819,5,B002N8AQL0,"Ill have to admit that I enjoy almost all spaghetti westerns ,they come up after I type in spagh which brings up spaghetti western and I just go down the lists until I find one that I don't already own(which is quite a few)because this is my favorite genre and I can view these films over and over again. I look at the ratings from other reviewers here and ill tell you they usually do not steer me wrong ,I have picked up a lot of very good films that I have never seen before this way and this is one of them. The film is well done from start to finish with a different plot than most spaghetti westerns but it still has plenty of shootouts,non stop action and my favorite thing I love about these films ,their excellent musical scores.",1378166400,4,738,4.204225352112676
8374820,5,B002N8AQL0,"Euro actor Enrico Maria Salerno who worked with many great Italian directors does a turn in the Spaghetti Western genre in the excellent 'BANDIDOS' aka 'CREPA TU...CHE VIVO IO'-1967 directed by the great Massimo Dallamano using the pseudonym Max Dillman.  Here we have the typical revenge story but with a twist as we see our hero having both his hands destroyed by outlaw Billy Kane.  Many years later , we see him working in a Western sideshow and ironically gives shelter to an escaped convict played by Terry Jenkins who he teaches his gun shooting techniques too.  Here the film resembles another great Spaghetti 'DJANGO-LAST KILLER' aka 'L'ULTIMO KILLER'-also 1967 where hero George Eastman(Luigi Montifiori) is taught the way of the gun by bounty hunter Anthony Ghidra but it stops there.  The film has a tragic finale but overall its one of the best in the genre.  Beautiful widescreen photography by Emilio Foriscot and an intense music score by Egisto Macchi really move the proceedings at a rapid clip inhancing the great script by Romano Milliorini, Juan Cobos, and Giambattista Musetto.  Dallimano directed many genre titles including his best work 'WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?' and much later teamed up with producer Harry Allan Towers for 'THE SECRET OF DORIAN GRAY' which is being released shortly by Raro Video.  'BANDIDOS' is his only contribution to the Western genre and more is the pity for it.  Highly recommended , Sinister Cinema transfers it with a nice crisp image and sound better than most of their releases lately. It makes a great addition to all Spaghetti Western collections.",1301875200,5,1610,5.00374531835206
8374821,5,B002N8AQL0,"This is one top notch action packed spaghetti western,that I can say
that I'm proud to have in my top twenty list of these westerns. The air
is so thick with pasta galore. That is,by saying action packed from the
begining to the end. This is not a dull cheap production either.
The opening credits and theme song is outstanding and carries this movie
and compliments the action all the way through to the end. Great musical score.
The DVD-R quality and transfer is very good and clear with letterbox
screen,makes it enjoyable to watch. Sometimes SINISTER get's it right
and sometimes not. But they did on this one. The product discription tells
the set up for the movie. ENRICO MARIA SALERNO gives an outstanding
performance,as well,as with all the actors. Great story,well scripted
and superbly well directed. The BALCAZAR FAMILY with DINO DE LAURENTIS
studios created one of the great class A spaghetti westerns during the
middle 60's(1967).This is a must have spaghetti western to own,even for
the first time viewer of these westerns. I do alot of research on these
before I purchase them. I'm glad I did. I belive this rank's right up there
with SERGIO LEONE AND CORBUCCI&SOLLIMA.Check it out,you won't be dissapointed!!! Hope this was helpful.",1269820800,23,1248,4.919431279620853
8374822,4,B002N8AQL0,"Bandidas, starring Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek, I thought was a very entertaining movie and had some new laughs when they join forces to fight a ruthless enforcer by becoming celebrated bank robbers cheered on by their countrymen. Lots of action and a movies worth watching on a quiet rainy night.",1149120000,,299,4.882352941176471
