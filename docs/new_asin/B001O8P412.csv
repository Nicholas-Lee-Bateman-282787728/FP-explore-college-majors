8329963,2,B001O8P412,"I very much enjoyed the beginners video of this series, but what on earth happened to the professional sound and visual quality of that first DVD? This DVD feels home made with ridiculous lighting that gives the dancers troll-like shadows on the walls and the microphones sound like a hurricane is blowing through them.

These DVDs are WAY expensive and the customer is entitled to expect much much better!",1409702400,2,406,4.884057971014493
8329964,5,B001O8P412,"This video is an absolutely superlative source of dance information for both students and teachers. This video does a great job incorporating the technique, style, and port de bras imperative for character dance, which are sometimes lost in many character classes. Inna Stabrova has a profound background in classical and character dance, which is clearly displayed in this video. This video is a wonderful supplement and great addition to anyone's dance library.",1346371200,,463,5.444444444444445
8329965,4,B001O8P412,Well presented basic Level 3 Vaganova style class. Am waiting for the remaining level DVDs (Levels 1 and 2) to be completed since there are so few Character dance materials. Good teaching aid for teachers and/or visual aid for amateur dancers.,1346025600,,243,4.951219512195122
8329966,5,B001O8P412,"This buy includes a dvd and a cd.
I was really happy with this one. Dvd is very nice and had wonderfully choreografed character dance series on russian schools style. Demonstrations include barre series in different styles and on center floor dance combinations. Series are first demonstrated and then Innna's pupil beautifully demonstrates them in music.
Would be very interesting to see lower level character dance classes too.",1309824000,3,429,5.323529411764706
8329967,5,B001O8P412,"This is a gorgeous, thorough video portraying character dance.  If you teach dance, you need to own this video.  I stumbled across it by accident and have fallen in love with it's devotion.  It is true and clear and never lies.  Purity in motion.",1238457600,3,246,4.5227272727272725
