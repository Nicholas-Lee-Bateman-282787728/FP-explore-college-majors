8520428,3,B007PK9NFQ,"Fun name, attractive ""models"", but this is such a narrow niche that I don't think it'll find much of a market in the U.S.

The whole premise is a game of chicken, if you will.  The models' clothes are -almost- not there.  Oh look, she's -almost- touching herself in the most wanton way.  There's just enough covering (or concealing) that the models are just a hair's breadth from nude, but it's done artistically and teasingly.  Each disc consists of a series of vignettes with model alone (in the first disc), like taking a shower (in a bikini), cooking (and pouring a bowl of eggs down the front of her apron); or with a faceless assistant touching and assisting in the tease, such as giving a massage with hands covering the model's naughty bits.  It's all done in such a languid way that the individual scenes kind of slide by, and the hour doesn't seem as long as I expected for what's essentially watching a scantily-clad woman touch herself suggestively.  For an idea of how skimpy the bikinis are, see Wicked Weasel.  In several of the scenes, there are sex toys in-hand, but not quite used to the fullest extent.  Tease, all the way through.  And self-aware, as the models frequently look into the camera.

There are four discs, each with a separate video of a different model:
* @HOME IDOL: Moe Takahashi with Moe Takahashi (naturally)
* Declaration of Tu. Ru. Pe. Ta with Rion Hatsune
* Limit of Kuikomi: Miku with Miku Hasegawa
* Limit of Kuikomi: Yuna Majikina with Yuna Majikina

Entertaining, artistically done, but be aware that what's for sale here would be hugging the border between PG and R in cinema in the U.S.  It's a viewing of different models in different scenarios and outfits, with the suggestion of sexuality thwarted at the last moment (or inch).  I shan't be seeking out any further Happy Chicken works in the future, but for what it is, it's well-produced.",1416614400,3,1888,4.664652567975831
