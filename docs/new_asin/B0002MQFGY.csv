2106998,5,B0002MQFGY,"I truly appreciate Owens' DVD on non-violent dog training. His sense of humor and gentleness, as exemplified in both the person's breathing techniques and the dog training itself, help the person focus on the relationship with their dog as more important than specific behaviors, although the behaviors are what one strives for in training. I especially appreciated the magnet game (to help dogs from jumping on guests, etc.) and the  information regarding contectualization.  Great dog training tool!",1107302400,15,501,5.4935064935064934
2106999,5,B0002MQFGY,I found Paul Owens style of dog training to be very simple and yet complete.  The 3 step method that he uses is very easily understood and implimented.  I have been practicing the behaviors with my dog and my 10 year old dog is learning new tricks.  I highly recommend The Dog Whisperer.,1104883200,6,287,4.377358490566038
2107000,5,B0002MQFGY,"This is the best dog training video I have ever seen. Rather than having to sit through a 'talking head', we see dogs obviously having a great time in a beautiful setting.  The photography and the direction are top notch, and the animation and celebrity voices add fun and humor.

Paul's easy and gentle approach to positive dog training prove it works. I was particularly impressed with the easy way to find exactly the subject I needed to review.",1093132800,11,448,4.658227848101266
2107001,5,B0002MQFGY,"If you want immediate results, and you want to have a stress-free, fun, and non-violent relationship with your dog, the Dog Whisperer DVD is the best way to get there. If you're not sure about this whole ""positive training"" thing, and still think you might need a good old jerk on the choke-chain every once in awhile, please, work with this DVD just once, and you'll see how much faster, more effective, and more fun this approach is.  My rescue puppy responded immediately and loves our training sessions. Within only 3 days, friends, family and strangers were oooohing and aaaaahing over his impressive ""tricks"" (sitting, lying down, and staying).  Best of all, the sessions are short and simple, and the steps toward each behavior are broken down and modeled clearly. Pair this with Paul Owens' book, and it's like having your own private dog trainer and behavioral expert in the house.",1092960000,15,890,4.887417218543046
2107002,5,B0002MQFGY,"This DVD really embodies everything I love about dog training!  Paul Owens makes it fun and low-pressure on both the human and the dog.  I have read his book, ""The Dog Whisperer"" and this is such a wonderful companion piece because it allows visual learners to see things put into practice that they have read about.  Plus, the DVD has funny puppets and great voiceover... what more could one ask for?  This a great DVD for families.",1092960000,8,433,4.584415584415584

There are extras which are fun, entertaining, and delightful.  One is very relaxing.  This is common sense training filled with love and compassion.  My dog responded to this training like a duck to water.  She trained extremely fast using these techniques. We got her from a shelter when she was 8 months old and had been in 2 foster homes.  Obedience was not her strong suit.  She's perfect now. Using these techniques has also bonded her closer to us.  If you can only own one dog training DVD, then this is what you are looking for.

So because this DVD only covers eight basic commands and I wanted to know every command in the universe, I looked for a more Indepth DVD and thought I found one by Nicole Wilde that got rave reviews. What a waste of money and huge disappointment that was. Paul Owens presents step by step methods in his training with sound reasoning behind what he's doing and why. He's thorough and able to convey precisely what to do to get the desired results. I found the  Nicole Wilde DVD to be sloppy in the methodology and also didn't like the fact that they repeated commands for the dog. Paul Owens teaches you to say the command once and allow the dog to think. It works. I am now buying Paul Owens' second Training DVD which is a 2 disc set. I can't wait to receive it.

2107082,4,B0002MQFGY,"When my girlfriend and I adopted our puppy a couple weeks ago, she was already reading Cesar religiously. I don't doubt that he knows a thing or two about dogs, but what I wanted was more practical training guides so that we could take advantage of our puppy's trainability early on. After hours searching, I found that this DVD had the better reviews and decided to take a chance on it.

I won't say that this DVD has all the bells and whistles, or is even laid out in the best format, because its not. However, what it lacks there, it makes up for with actual training materials. We had tried training the puppy using Milan's book with almost no success, but the video clips on the DVD had our little girl following the ""sit,"" ""stay,"" and ""come"" commands within 15 minutes. My girlfriend, who mocked me at first for getting this DVD (it is a little hokey, especially the animated short film included), now uses it every day. We have only really gone into the basics of training so far, but there is also a whole division with more advanced tricks and games to play with your dog.

2107100,3,B0002MQFGY,"I've never had a Dog before, so I've been trying to learn read and watch as much as I can about raising well behaved Puppy.

I'm halfway through Mr. Owens' book which is an excelent read, BTW I highly reccomend it. But I have mixed feelings on this DVD's.

It certainly ""shows"" you phisically how you should perform in front of your dog to accomplish specific behaviors; watching this is always helpful. The DVD is divided in chapters that each teach a specific behavior (sit, come, leave it, etc) each lasting probably 5 minutes. There is not a ""play all"" button, so at the end of each behavior you have to select the next behavior from the menu to keep watching... kind of annoying.

All excersices are very biased in the sense that all dogs perform as expected. You only see what happens when the dog performs as expected. On occasions the dog fails and they say to go back and restart where the dog was successful, but they never show or teach you what to do if the dog wanders away, or gets overexcited or losses interest, etc etc.

At the end of each behavior chapter they recap what you have learned, but they are the same reccomendations for every chapter, so after watching a couple, it becomes repetitive (that may be the intention) and end up being boring.

I would like to see a new release of the DVD with more ""what to do in case your dog..."" cases. I think Mr. Owens has much more to teach than the material that was chosen for this DVD. It is not his fault, he is dog trainer; not a DVD director. He should probably fire his editor and find a better one for his next DVD.

In summary, I think there are more good things than bad with this DVD. If this is the first time you are training a dog, you should get this DVD... you will learn something, eventhough you could have learned a lot more if this DVD was properly done. But for 16 bucks I think it is not a bad deal.",1273622400,4,1885,4.266106442577031
2107101,3,B0002MQFGY,"Paul Owens throws himself a lot of softballs in these videos.  The dogs are pathetic, low-drive, soft, lethargic lumps.  If you use a leash at all on a high-drive dog then your dog is going to experience what Paul calls ""violence"" as soon as he hits the end of the leash.  So forget the ridiculous ""non-violent"" nonsense.  Dogs are violent predators and carnivores and while unnecessarily harsh abuse is counterproductive, there is nothing wrong with appropriate corrections.  Dogs give corrections to the ones they dominate and it's a natural expectation for them to receive them.  If you correct them fairly, they will respect you.

A few of the techniques in the video are useful, especially with puppies where you want to prefer motivational techniques over anything else.  Paul doesn't teach marker training or treat chasing which are pretty much the foundation of any training program for competitive dog sports today.  If you don't learn those methods, you'll be missing a huge chunk of knowledge.

Any serious training involves building drive and focus, then learning and three or four other steps.  Paul's methods can be useful for the learning phase but the preceding drive and focus work would actually make Paul's methods less effective in some cases.  Personally, I think treat chasing is the best method for dealing with a dog where you've built a ton of drive and have developed intense focus.  No matter how a dog learned something, after a dog learns something, he needs to take corrections for any disobedience.  If you don't enforce obedience then you are reinforcing disobedience.  There is no apathy in a dog, especially a dog with a lot of drive.  When the dog is obeying all the time and every time, then the distractions are increased until he learns to obey under distraction -- low levels at first, and high levels when he's finishing.  If you simply never expect much from your dog, then Paul's method would work sometimes.

Paul's ""philosophy"" is risky to driven and hard dogs.  Owners will not succeed with this method when they have a dog with a lot of drive or a dog that's hard, and there are plenty that are both.  Those dogs are at risk when they are only trained with methods like Paul's.  Paul is unfair to those dogs by dismissing corrections, prong collars, electric collars and other useful training methods and tools and making them out to be ""violent"" or abusive.  That's false information.  Either Paul is ignorant or he's preying on the ignorance of his customers.

I will agree that ""force"" training methods and choke collars are abusive, but Paul's ""positive-only"" method throws the baby out with the bath water.  Prong collars and e-collars are not abusive.  I've used them on myself and they do not injure.  I would much rather use either one on a hard dog than have to try to communicate a correction to him with a flat collar.  To a hard dog, a hard pop on a flat collar just means you want to play a little more rough.  It sends his drive level up and you multiply the problem.  This is because dogs do violence.  They play violent.  Maybe some dogs are like the ones in Paul's videos and they can't handle anything more violent than a book dropping off the table but there are other dogs that are not the least bit aggressive but they wouldn't stop ripping you up for a game if you didn't teach them otherwise.  Paul won't show you those dogs because his methods don't work with them.",1271116800,5,3435,4.719327731092437

2107104,2,B0002MQFGY,"This video consists of multiple ""chapters"" each dealing with different aspects of dog training.  Each chapter discusses training a specific behavior.  My overall impression is that the first step in training is discussed well in each chapter but large gaps exist between the first step and final behavior that are not addressed in the videos.  My family gathered around the TV to watch this... we watched it twice... it has gone back in the cabinet and we're unlikely to refer to it again.  This video also does not play from start to end - rather a menu is shown and you need to select the specific 5-minute chapter you wish to watch (such as ""training your dog to fetch"").  We have found dog training books that are more convenient to use than loading the video.

I had to keep the remote in my hand for the entire video because I was constantly hitting play. There was also a ""dogs perspective"" segments at the end of each ""lesson"". Why? I don't understand that. Im an adult not a child. Why the kiddie training video?

I understand the necessity of treats at the beginning of training any dog however, the amount of treats given to the obviously already well trained dogs was a bit over the top.

I learned one new thing (magnet behaviors) and have seen good results from that, but I didn't see much on it that will help us correct ""problem"" behaviors.

In a effort to make this a family friendly experience, this DVD is chuck full of bad animations, puppet shows and horribly amateurish dog voice-overs that would only appeal to the youngest kids.  Granted, there is some very very helpful information here, but you have to navigate around the mind-numbing pre-school silliness to find it. Case in point: the teaching hand gestures section is demonstrated by a homemade muppet.

My suggestion to Mr. Owens would be to make this into two DVD's; one for adults who to benefit from your obvious wisdom and professional instruction -- then make a second one to entertain the kids.",1258502400,22,882,4.701298701298701

There are silly pretend animal ""voice overs""(idiotic sounding human voices talking as if it was the animal) which I didn't care for.  The DVD contains a menu from which you go back to after each segment.  You have to click the segment you want to view to play it. There is no choice for ""play all"".  This feature can be both helpful and annoying.  I love Paul Owens style, he is very gentle and humane, most of his training is based on treats and praise. I like that and agree with him in how he insists we should always be gentle with animals at all times, especially during training.  However, I did not like the quality of this DVD.  It is boring.  There is a new, 2007 version of this DVD which is much better.  It is called The Dog Whisperer - Volume 2, Solving Common Behavior Problems.

2107124,1,B0002MQFGY,"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD.  I enjoyed the book, but this DVD was just terrible.  It was low quality and filled with irritating, useless segments for each behavior where there is a ""dog"" voice-over that sounds like a Beggin' Strips commercial-- eight times!  The DVD also included some very out of place, idiotic segments with someone in an animal suit that looked like an Easter Bunny , as well as an out of place animated segment.  Also, at the end of each behavior segment, they put in the same basic advice segment each time.  By the end of the video I had watched the same exact advice segment eight times.  The DVD was chopped up into short segments, so it was impossible to watch it without using the remote to select another segment every 30 seconds to few minutes.  The teaching itself felt extremely rushed, like they were under a time crunch to get the video made!  Segments teaching each behavior were short, and they left each behavior at a very basic stage, sometimes with the treat still in the dog's face to get him to do it.  From the title I was expecting the training to go much further.  Get the book, but skip this terrible DVD.",1244678400,17,1165,4.504761904761905

We figured we'd watch the DVD anyway since it was my mistake.  First of all, the formatting of this DVD is extremely annoying and choppy.  Secondly, I'm not sure that I agree that feeding treats to my dog until she explodes is really the best way to train her.  Third, it said something about puppy training in the title and I couldn't find ANYTHING on the DVD about puppies at all.  Could be it's there and I just lost patience before I got to it.

2107137,5,B0002MQFGY,"When I first watched this DVD, I thought the training described seemed too simplistic to possibly be effective.  However, my mind was changed instantly when I taught my puppy ""down"" for the first time in about 30 seconds using Paul's techniques (seriously!).  On the second try, she was down and happy about it and anxious to try it again and again.  Although the production quality may not quite be at the level it could be, the teaching is so extraordinary that I would say this is a ""must have"" for anyone with a dog and a pulse rate.  Even after formal training in a more traditional style, we've gone back and retrained our dog using Paul's methods and cannot believe how much more responsive she is and how much more fun we're having together.  I HIGHLY recommend all of Paul's DVDs.  His enthusiasm is infectious and his love for dogs is obvious.  Don't take the simplicity and brevity of the segments to mean they are less effective.  Just watch them more times so that you don't miss the details.  Take it from someone who has read dozens of books on the topic and viewed many DVDs as well, there is not a better approach to training than positive reinforcement and clicker training.",1239753600,,1192,4.584905660377358

2107141,2,B0002MQFGY,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister-in-law who had just gotten a Sheltie puppy. I did not spend enough time reading the description and thought it was from the ""real"" dog whisperer Cesar Milan. In actuality, it is someone else. Judging from the results of my sister-in-laws dog, the training methods in this video are problematic. Her dog will behave, but only when it expects to receive payment. I've owned a couple dogs in my time, and trained them all to be well behaved using few if any treats. Positive reinforcement works wonders, but treats IMHO should be kept to a minimum. Negative reinforcement is at times necessary as well. I know its not very PC to say that, but it is true. I learned this wile working for a retired veteran who kenneled any number of dogs in the summer for extra income. He hired me to feed and care for these dogs, and during that summer I learned a whole lot 'on the job.' One of the things I learned is you cannot give a dog enough praise or encouragement or treats to break it of the habit of jumping up on people (which would never have happened in the first place with good training, but these were NOT my dogs). You have to use negative reinforcement, which in this case involved knocking the dogs unto their back. Again, I know that isn't very PC, but you can take it from me, it does work, and it works quickly. While I prefer positive reinforcement, as with children, there sometimes need to be consequences.

I suggest you spend a bit more and make sure you get an actual Cesar Milan DVD set. Your dog will thank you.",1230249600,3,1574,4.40893470790378

2107155,4,B0002MQFGY,"Luckily, I read some of the other reviews before I ordered this DVD. I understood the difference between this ""Dog Whisperer"" and Cesar Millan. Both are excellent. This one is more for training than correcting behavior. I found it very helpful. My puppy has learned SIT, DOWN and is working on STAY (doing well)... all based on the information shown on this DVD. I also ordered clickers from Paul Owens, because he shows how to do clicker training; and they are good (and very inexpensive compared with ones from the pet stores). I recommend it. Just be aware, before you order, that this is TRAINING (as it says), not Cesar Millan-style behavior correction/rehabilitation.

The only thing I thought was a little ""off"" was the parts of the DVD that are ""from the dog's perspective"". It was cute the first time I saw the first one, but it got annoying after a while. But you can just skip that part. Also, it would be good if, in the next version, Paul Owens shows some slow motion or many more repetitions so you can really get the process he's doing. Also, it seemed to me that some of the dogs he was using were not new to the task he was teaching them, but I could be wrong. Also, it would be helpful if there were more specifics to puppies. The walking he shows is with a pretty large dog and he shows giving the dog treats as he walks along. Can't exactly do that with a puppy unless I want to walk all bent over to get treats to the little guy. (Also there is a lot of info on the DVD about how to use treats successfully.)

All in all, though, I give this DVD at least 4 out of 5 stars. It's helpful.",1188864000,6,1607,4.282894736842105
2107175,1,B0002MQFGY,"Well I expected this to be the ultimate about positive dog training but this video disappointed me to the extreme. First of all, Mr Owens uses the clicker in all segments and unless I missed it there is absolutely no mention of the clicker in his video. It's a very important tool and why is it not explained in the videos?

The training videos are going way too fast. If you can get your dog to do all those tricks in 30 seconds then you're good. There are few segments where you can see the dog fail and how he makes the dog try again but overall the training is going way too fast.

I don't agree with his ""leave it"". To me ""leave it"" is ""leave it forever, don't even think about getting this again"". But he gives the ""leave it"" item to the dog as a reward. So that doesn't work for socks or chewing furniture.

The ""dog's view"" segments may be fun for a dog or a 5 yo but they were totally useless for me. I am not a dog.

There are better videos out there for positive training. Being the first one to introduce positive training I expected much more from Paul. Very disappointed and will not recommend this video.",1187308800,14,1119,4.190697674418605
2107176,5,B0002MQFGY,"I found Paul Owen's DVD The Dog Whisperer, Beginning and Intermediate--to be an easy to understand
and easy to actually do video.  My sense of the core philosophy was basic training strengthens the essential relationship of the dog and you and promotes well being on both sides.  Paul Owens seems to understand that you may take a bit of time to work up to regular training and that's OK.  And that's how it was for me.  But once my Shepherd mix puppy, Sara, and I got into a rhythm it was easy and became a fun part of our interaction not a chore.  My kids jump in enthusiastically but not consistently and it still seems to work.  The DVD is easy to
follow and remember when you're not in front of it.  All in all a big success.

2107178,4,B0002MQFGY,"Paul Owen's DVD, The Dog Whisperer, is so upbeat, lighthearted and clear, it's easy to miss just how crucial, dare I say even life saving, his approach is for the average dog owner--especially people with so called ""difficult dogs."" Sure, there's a goofy cartoon at the beginning and some hilarious doggie voice overs, but who says training has to be so grim and serious all the time anyway? As a kindergarten teacher, I know from experience that my students learn much better when they're having fun. Why should it be any different for me and my dog?

About a month ago our wonderful, obedient, people loving and highly intelligent Pit Bull puppy suddenly began barking and growling at other dogs.  We were so surprised by this and so concerned that we almost made a fatal mistake. We almost fell into the trap of the ""dominance"" model so prevalent in the dog world these days. At the first sign of growling, we tried instant correction: the ubiquitous leash jerk and harsh noise technique. When this didn't work and her behavior escalated, once--just once--my boyfriend tried the ""alpha-roll-over."" Everything about it felt wrong and we will always regret that we did it.  Not only were we completely stressed out by the experience, but our happy-go-lucky puppy was suddenly a cowering, frightened, growling bundle of nerves. The only thing we had accomplished was to teach her that seeing another dog meant: 1) that her owners were going to get really uptight and 2) something bad was going to happen to her. Not surprisingly, the next time we met a dog, she exploded, lunging and growling like a puppy possessed. Something had to be done, and luckily, via a chain of recommendations and after reading several other really good books on positive dog training, we have now added Paul Owen's DVD to our arsenal.

Now, as someone else has already stated, Paul does not address problem issues like aggression directly in this DVD (for that I would also highly recommend the books Click For Calm by Emma Parsons and Scaredy Dog by Ali Brown). However, it's a mistake to assume that learning the so called basics such Sit, Stay, Come and Down should somehow be put in a separate category than ""dog- psychology."" Every interaction you have with your dog builds a relationship. And it's really your choice: do you want this relationship to be built on fear and intimidation or trust and willing partnership? That is what Positive Training is all about.  Paul Owen's approach seems simplistic  on the surface but it is really not because he is teaching how to be pro-active rather than re-active. Instead of correcting your dog all the time for doing things wrong, in incremental baby steps, you set your dog up to Do The Right Thing in the first place. The whole emphasis is different. From stressed-out anticipation of all things negative to a joyous celebration of just how good your dog can be.

Of course, the proof is in the pudding...Using the methods on Paul Owen's DVD, not only have my puppy's obedience skills solidified dramatically, but I am much more clear in my expectations of what I want her to do in the first place--which makes all the difference. Now, every time she turns away from another dog, looks at me and/or comes when I call her, she gets a happy hooray!  and a treat.  She sits, she stays, she heels, but best of all, her happy-go-lucky personality is coming back.  And every time she gets things right (which is very very often now because she is so darn eager to please!), our confidence grows that no matter what happens out in the big bad world, we are a team: she knows I'll keep her safe and I know that every day we work together, she's more and more likely to stay calm and do what I ask.

I highly recommend this DVD for beginners as well as more experienced dog owners. Try it. You'll laugh, you'll have fun, you'll re-remember to notice how great your dog is, and I swear, if you stick with it, you'll get amazing results.",1184284800,4,3956,4.677697841726618

Her time at the pound wasn't much better.  That said, she's sweet and loving and we wanted to find the right way to help her recover from her past.

This DVD has turned out to be perfect for us.

Paul Owens understands why dogs behave the way they do.  His approach to training is simple and powerful.  Using his techniques we were able to make amazing progress in little more than a week.  It feels like we've been trained as much as Lucy has.  Between this DVD and Paul Owens' book, we've learned how to speak dog.

The DVD is easy to navigate and the menus allow you to get to exactly the information you need.  The step-by-step approach to training made it easy to get started right away.  The training principles seem simple, but they work.  And the insight into how dogs learn helped to alleviate both our aniexty and our impatience.

The DVD tempers hard facts with humor and there's a great computer-animated piece called ""Man's First Friend"" that's a real treat.

We love our dog and wanted to mold her into a positive member of our family without frightening or intimidating her.  She'd already had enough of that in her life.  This DVD is getting us there.

2107204,2,B0002MQFGY,"The training methods taught on this dvd are easy to use and work well. I just don't feel it is complete enough as far as whole training. It is basically just a dvd about training animals tricks. It doesn't train you how to house train a puppy. It also doesn't give you any ideas about training dogs on something other than what is on the dvd. The dvd also gets kind of annoying with the dogs point of view clips. Luckily you can skip these. I personally would not recommend this, but if you have an adult dog that you just want to get it to heal or sit or lay down this dvd will teach you a real quick learning technique. Something else I did like is the fact that they teach using very kind procedures toward the animals. I was able to teach my blue healer pup (Abby) to sit, lay down, come and heel in about 3 tries each. I liked the techniques, but it just seems its more of a trick dvd than a full training dvd.",1163030400,10,915,4.060773480662983
2107215,1,B0002MQFGY,I thought this video was a Cesar Milan Dog Whisperer video.  I was linked to it by the Amazon suggestions on the Cesar Milan book page.  Very disappointing.,1162512000,10,156,4.535714285714286
2107216,5,B0002MQFGY,"For those or you who are griping that this DVD is not Cesar Millan, you should learn something.  Paul Owens is the ORIGINAL dog whisperer.  He wrote the book, The Dog Whisperer, long before Cesar was in business!  Paul Owens is a highly-educated animal behaviorist who knows how to correctly communicate with a dog - without techniques like hanging, rolling, choking, e-collars, leash pops, choke chains, hand bites or foot corrections.  If you purchased this DVD thinking it was Cesar, you should have looked at the name of the author!  Someone should explain copyright infringement to Cesar and National Geographic for using the name The Dog Whisperer when it properly belonged to Paul Owens.

This is an EXCELLENT DVD and shows you how to work with your dog with respectful techniques - no need for force, fear or intimidation techniques.  These techniques work - I use them with my own dogs as well as the dogs I instruct.  Paul Owens' techniques work as fast as people think that Cesar's techniques work ... they last longer ... they work with the dog's natural state ... and they are pleasant for the owners to use.",1159228800,32,1121,4.772020725388601

And I've also ready Shelby Marlo's book (another great find).  But none of their tips helped me with the ""nipping"" problems I've been having with Sierra.  Now, after only 2 days of working with her using Paul's methods Sierra's behaviors have drastically changed and we're able to have fun with behavior modification rather than it feeling like punishment.",1157932800,11,519,4.608695652173913
2107218,5,B0002MQFGY,"This is, hands down, the best dog training DVD available today.  Paul Owens bases his entire approach to dog training on a philosophy of nonviolence, which means not causing any physical, emotional, or psychological harm to your dog.  What a relief for those of us who are tired of being told to bully or ""dominate"" our dogs!  The training exercises that Owens explains and demonstrates work wonderfully at producing a dog who is cooperative and enthusiastic about responding to requests, without any yelling or jerking of chains or grabbing and shaking.  I don't WANT to do that to my dog, and Owens shows how you don't HAVE to do that in order to have a dog who fits in as a well behaved member of a human family.

What's unique about this DVD is that it combines the sound scientific principles behind ""reward-based"" training with a philosophical approach that draws on yoga and other Eastern disciplines.  Reward-based training uses techniques that reward the dog for doing ""good"" behavior, and witholds rewards when the dog doesn't do the good behavior.  It sets up a situation in which dogs enjoy doing the things you ask of them.  On the other hand, the breathing techniques that Owens demonstrates have a concrete effect on the way your dog reacts.  They really work!  I have calmed down my barking dog many times, simply by changing the way I breathe.

Seven years ago, I read Owens' book THE DOG WHISPERER, and this DVD takes up nicely where the book left off.  The advantage to the DVD is that you get to see the training exercises actually demonstrated.  I also appreciate the fact that you can go directly to the exercise you would like to work on by choosing from the menu, without having to rewind or fast forward.

This should NOT be confused with Cesar Millan's DOG WHISPERER television series.  Cesar Millan uses very different methods, including choke chains, etc.  I think it's unfortunate that Millan chose to use the name of a book that was published long before Millan ever appeared on TV.  Paul Owens is the original Dog Whisperer.

As a bonus, the DVD starts with a cartoon that made me laugh my head off.  It captured so well the way stress around the household can escalate to a boiling point, and how we relate to our dogs in both good and bad ways because of it.  It made me both recognize and laugh at myself.

Overall, the DVD is very accessible and fun, and works well as an introduction to training for the whole family--kids as well as adults.",1154995200,87,2477,4.635321100917431
2107219,5,B0002MQFGY,"I have a ten year old terrier and a one year old terrier.  The first was trained the old-fashioned way (punishment/reward), the second was trained according to Paul Owen's method in his dvd and book.  I achieved faster and more reliable results with Paul's method than with the traditional way, while retaining more of my terrier's happy-go-lucky nature.  Though my first dog is well behaved, the traditional method was a longer, more stressful road for both of us.

Paul's method involves giving a command to the dog, then rewarding that behaviour.  So, in the case where the dog is doing something you don't want, like jumping on a guest, instead of saying ""No Jumping!"" and scolding, you say ""Come!"", then ""Down"", and bring the dog to your side.  The theory is, instead of telling your dog what you DON'T want, have them do what you DO want, thus eliminating the undesirable behaviour.  This way, the dog chooses to ""be good"", instead of being forced or threatened to ""be good"".

I recommend it very highly if you are a looking for quick results while maintaining a close and equitable relationship with your dog.  If you enjoy a more stern and severe approach involving domination-based punishment, and you are a very controlling person, then don't waste your time.  If you are a dog lover willing to put in some time and patience at the beginning in exchange for an obedient dog for the long term, then this method is for you. Paul's dogs obey because they CHOOSE and WANT to, not because they fear punishment.

One handy aspect to Paul Owen's DVD is that you can select from different commands ""Sit"", ""Stay"", etc, without having to go throught the whole DVD.  This was especially helpful because my terrier learned certain behaviours quickly while others took more time, so it was very effective to be able to access only the command we needed to work on.

Also, to address the Cesar Millan issue, Cesar has never professed  to being a dog trainer.  He says many times on his show ""I am a dog psychologist, not a trainer"", and his dog rehab program in LA is called the ""Dog Psychology Center"", not a ""training school"".  Cesar  rehabilitates dogs that have chronic, compulsive behaviour problems, he does NOT teach them to ""Sit"", ""Stay"", ""Come"", etc.  So comparing Cesar's Way to Paul's Way is silly, they perform entirely different functions and I appreciate both.",1154304000,254,2370,4.767156862745098
2107220,5,B0002MQFGY,"First off, let me preface by saying that I own 2 highly rambunctious (some would have said out-of-control) herding dogs.  I had tried many, many training techniques (including the current fad ""dominance theory""), yet my dogs weren't responding.  In fact, one became so afraid of the leash (which we had been using during training) that it became impossible to take her on walks.  Then I discovered (through some great resources like ""Whole Dog Journal"", my local humane societies and a WONDERFUL book entitiled ""The Other End Of The Leash"" by Dr. Patricia McConnell) reward-based training which is completly non-violent and turned training into a favorite part of the day for both my dogs and I.  During my copious research one name that kept coming up was dog-trainer Paul Owens.  I bought the DVD and the book and was amazed to find that I got reliable results in usually no longer than 3-15 minute sessions.  My dogs WANTED to do the right thing - not be ""corrected"" for doing the wrong thing.  Many people criticize treat-reward training and think that you will constantly have to carry food in your pockets.  This is simply not true.  We are currently down to about a 50-50% treat-affection reward and the treats are lessening daily while the results are not.  Mr Owens also calls to attention the fact that our states-of-mind during training have a direct impact on our dogs and their ability to focus and learn.  My dogs and I still practice a little every day, but the minute my dogs see me head for Mr Owen's book they come running.",1153612800,94,1541,4.734082397003745
2107221,1,B0002MQFGY,I purchased this dvd based on other reviews and the title which sounded like what I needed.  It is filled with childish animation and the small parts of the dvd devoted to training are equally childish.  I learned NOTHING from this dvd and I hope I can strongly discourage anyone else from making the same mistake and waste of money.,1153353600,17,333,4.533333333333333
2107222,5,B0002MQFGY,"I have just been through the Raise with Praise begining training classes with my dog Lummox and trainer Paul Owens, author and director of the Dog Whisperer book and DVD. I can honestly say that I was stunned to watch as WITHIN ONE TO THREE MINUTES, three completely hyper active and unruly dogs not only calmed, but learned three behaviors, sit, lay down and stay, using his methods. I could barely believe my eyes. His knowledge of dog behavior and their psychology, as well as how humans are directly responsible for any and all of their ""problem behaviors"" is impressive to begin with. But more importantly is his understanding that there is absolutely no need to jerk, shock, or otherwise exert strongarm techniques on the dog to elicite proper behavior, as some other better publicized trainers practice.

I enrolled my own dog Lummox (a gentle giant) solely to help him socialize and lose his fear of strange or different situations, hoping to help raise his confidence level. It did. And Lummox is not in the least interested in bribes or treats, and so the proof of this method lay in that it works whether or not a dog will accept treats! Lummox quickly learned that a new situation does not mean something bad will happen, and he became relaxed and I watched as his confidence level grew very quickly. The very second class saw Lummox excitedly leading ME to our class location. He remembered how to get there and was looking forward to it. I never would have believed it.

Again, I cannot stress to people how amazing I found this training method, watching the other dogs in class responding so quickly - and in a lasting way. The knowledge I've gained has made a tremendous difference for the way I look on communication between dog and man.

I close by remarking that the method for training any animal using praise and kindess is a model that can be directly applied to our human condition as well. For I not only believe, but I have seen with my own eyes, that this knowledge can be applied not only with animals, but with human beings as well.

Thank you Mr. Owens - your methods embody what it means to be a true dog whisperer.

2107223,5,B0002MQFGY,"I chose this video because the ""non-violent methodology"" appealed to me.  I have a 2 1/2 year old yellow Labrador retriever who learned the majority of his beginner training from this DVD.  I watched the methods Paul Owens illustrates and was able to successfully reenacted them in my home.  This DVD properly explains through verbal and visual instruction a non-violent dog training method.

And these methods do work but you need to keep up with them.  Practice each a few times a day and you will see wonderous results.  Ok, so the DVD is not a Spielberg production, but does that matter?  The audio is clear and each instruction shows a dog following the command.

NO, THIS IS NOT THE GUY ON TV, however, I would never choose that type of training for my dog.  I do not believe ""jerking, tugging, pulling,"" or dominant training in general is right for my dog.  In training my dog, one of my primary goals is not to change or alter his personality  - I don't want a ""robot"" or a ""soldier"" for a dog.  Instead, I want a dog that reacts to a command because it is a learned response, not a response in fear of pain.  If you feel the same way, then order this DVD.  If you want the ""jerking, choking, pulling"" type of training then this is not the right DVD for you.  You need to decide how your pet will be taught, just as you would a child.  Do you ""jerk, choke, pull, drag"" your child?  Probably not.

If you are viewing this page it is clear you are seeking ""at home"" training methods for your beloved pet.  You should already be proud for taking the time to investigate products, but you also need to read about the products you seek.  Good luck in your search and in training.",1153094400,16,1682,4.364516129032258
2107224,5,B0002MQFGY,"If you're the sort of person who thinks dogs are inherently stupid and need to be bullied into compliant behavior, this training technique might not be for you.  If, on the other hand, you've had any first-hand experience with dogs and observed their behavior, you'll completely get this method and understand that it's us humans who need the training as much or more than our pets.

This is the opportunity to train your dog with love and respect.  No hitting, jerking,choking, or yelling.  And no small surprise, a quicker, more joyful route to acceptable behavior.  In just one week of starting Paul's ""Raise with Praise"" techniques  we were well on our way to turning our timid rescued Greyhound into a confident, happy and  happy-to-please dog. It's fun too.  Our six year old daughter is successfully learning Paul's techniques right along with us.

We worked with a professional trainer whose techniques were similar to Cesar Millan. After three months, it was obvious that  corrections and negative verbage would not work. Within three days of changing our strategy and using the techniques on this video, we observed significant changes in our dog. Being a teacher, I am aware of the power of positive reinforcement with children, but never realized how important it is to dogs.

2107236,5,B0002MQFGY,"I found Paul Owens' video, The Dog Whisperer, very succinct with a very easy format to navigate and full of specific steps in which to train your dog using ONLY positive reinforcement techniques.

For individuals new to dog/puppy training, this video provides a very clear understanding of the method used to train positively  a canine.  Paul Owens clearly explains how dogs learn and the degree to which they do not generalize commands, therefore requiring the person training them to train in a variety of situations.

He provides excellent information and a technique for teaching a dog how to learn not to jump on people, as well as other commands, sit, down, stay, etc.  Paul teaches with an upbeat, happy manner in short periods of duration which makes the training enjoyable for both dog and human alike.  While I found his video very helpful for the novice trainer or one unfamiliar with positive reinforcement techniques, his book, which I highly recommend, provides much more indepth information and exercises to use as your dog grows.

His book and video are ones you will want to refer to frequently as your dog grows and are ones you will readily suggest to others. I continue to go back to his book for more suggestions about how to shape my dog's behavior and how to really cement the behavior I want to see in her.  For those who have less time to read and/or who enjoy learning by watching the training in action, this video provides all of the basic fundamentals and exercises to teach your dog what our society finds polite  behavior in dogs.

If more people spent the time initally to understand the canine mind and to train their puppies, reinforcing good behavior, fewer adolescent dogs would be found in shelters wanting for homes. Paul Owens provides such information in his video and book.",1152576000,8,1814,4.803858520900322
2107237,4,B0002MQFGY,"First off, I would like to say how disheartened I am to read these scathing reviews and viscious attacks, due to simple confusion. There is no reason for such an attack. The DVD itself may not be of a certain production standard at times, but the method and approach are definitely not to be questioned. Having said that, I would like to say how nice it is to see another approach for teaching one's dog, especially, since much like humans, the same dominant oriented method will not work for every dog. Multiple approaches are needed. I would like to address the criticism of Paul not dealing with ""red zone"" dogs. One being that I have a red zone dog and so does another member of our family. We both tried the dominant oriented approach with training our dogs, with other trainers, and it simply did not work. It's hard to exert dominance over an animal that has been abused and then expect the same dominanance that was used to abuse them, to work. Compassion was needed and both our animals have made leaps and strides using this method, so much so that they are completely different dogs, family dogs. This is not to say the other method is not effective, but again it all depends on the dog. So I would like to say also that the view that this is method is simply bribing your animal into being treat greedy is simply false. Remember Pavlov had his dogs react to positive reinforcement and this is just simply using those lessons of basic psychology. Oh and remember this, when one is angry about ordering the wrong dvd and how can he call himself the ""dog whisperer,"" take a look at who actually has the trademarked symbol after the name... that's not a critique of the methods, just of the argument... These are tools that both trainers give the public to use, both valid, just choose which you find best and most comfortable working with. I know this worked for me and my family.",1152489600,9,1889,4.510204081632653
2107238,1,B0002MQFGY,"This DVD was so boring and was a waste of money.

2107239,5,B0002MQFGY,"This is a delightful, helpful, and amazingly useful DVD that teaches an effective and loving training method.  And most importantly, it works!  I recently rescued an older, traumatized, abused, and aggressive dog that the city shelter was ready to euthanize.  I used the techniques in this DVD, and within days, I had earned the dog's trust. Now my buddy displays no aggression at all: and this all happened within days, with a large, strong, difficult dog! I can't imagine trying to display dominance over this dog in order to control him: my guess is that's why he was so freaked out in the first place.

The psychology behind Mr. Owen's techniques (basically, classical conditioning using treats to reward desireable behaviors) was a revelation to me.  I knew all about it with humans, but for some reason had never thought about using it with my dogs. The tools worked as well with my friend's puppy, and my parents' 130 pound adult German Shepherd.  The fact that all of it can be accomplished through non-violence makes it even better.

I was surprised to see some of the other reviewers comments because although this DVD is recent, Paul Owen's The Dog Whisperer book was published in 1999, years before the other trainer who calls himself by the same name came into the public's awareness.  This is true dog whispering:  knowing how the dog thinks, and using the most gentle, loving, and effective methods to shape the dog's behavior rather than ""breaking"" the dog (just like the real Horse Whisperer does with horses).

I was excited to see ""Dog Baseball"" until I realized it consisted of putting dog treats on bases - and he described this as a game to wean your dog of treats.

There were some half assed puppets thrown in and some really crappy animation.

That said, the DVD is very informative, BUT

I didn't really need a cartoon or ""dogs-eye"" view; I would rather have seen information on crate training or housebreaking a new pup, instead.

Finally, choosing between the TWO ""dog whisperers"" re: training techniques isn't a question of force v. positive reinforcement! The two approach dog training from totally different perspectives!  This DVD is geared for working with calmer, non-neurotic, non-aggressive and/or non-fearful dogs and puppies; Milan works with ""red zone"" dogs: agressive, neurotic, or fearful alpha dogs, rehabilitating them.

For those who are not familiar with Rhodesian Ridgebacks they are wonderful family dogs but they also are very strong willed, stubborn and very smart. Oh and pretty big (90 pounds and over 110 lbs)I say this because they can be a challenge at times. I've used Paul's book and his DVD and I'm telling you that it works.

However like anything else in life you have to follow the program. There are no magic wands, no quick and easy solutions that don't require effort. You have to follow the instructions and keep with it. But isn't that true for most things in life that are worth the effort?

I have tried other training methods in the past that require choke collars and such. Sure they work but I never liked utilizing the methods. I never felt good about hurting my dog and causing discomfort to him in order to have him sit. My dogs are part of my family. No, they aren't my children, I know the difference (my dogs are better behaved!) but none the less I'm not going to use choke collars and such when I can train by giving the dog a snack. Paul's non-violent method works very quickly (however you must keep with it) and very effectively.

Fortunately, we soon discovered Paul Owen's ""Dog Whisperer"" book and later his DVD.  Paul Owen's techniques as given in this DVD are much more up-to-date and focus on positive training techniques without being permissive.  The techniques cover all the standard skills I feel every dog should have and provide effective, positive ways to resolve problem behaviors.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who asks.

However, I'm also careful to let people know that this is not connected to the backward, punishment based techniques of Cesar Milan popularized in his ""Dog Whisperer"" TV shows.  Owen's book preceeded Milan's TV shows by many years and their methods are polar opposites and clearly illustrate the choices people have in training their dogs, that is force (Milan) vs. non-force (Owens).

This fellow is an intelligent, talented  teacher- eminently endearing, and the overall quality of the production is great. I wish I lived close enough to take lessons from him.

I'd have given this 5 stars but for some of the dog voice-over segments were kind of annoying (I did like Frenchie, tho) and perhaps the actual points being made could have been done more clearly in a less ""cute"" fashion.

I loved the gal and her hip action! I'd recommend this training dvd to friends with a new dog, and I'd buy it again.",1141430400,4,814,4.568493150684931
2107262,4,B0002MQFGY,"I've read other reviews and in my opinion, they are missing the point of this video. Paul Owens' video is a training video for dogs who are in a specific state of mind. This video covers techniques to train a dog that is ALREADY submissive. Cesar says that you can only train a dog when it is in a calm submissive state because they are open minded. If you have a dog that is aggressive, nervous, hyper, disobediant, or have other unwanted behaviors, you cannot train that dog yet so this video would not be for you. The DVD seems a little difficult to navigate, but perhaps the navigation was deliberate and it's not a big deal. Paul Owens' content is clear to understand and is easily outlined so that even your child could do it. Highly recommend for those who want their dog to do more than 'stay'. 4.5 stars.",1141084800,11,813,4.3907284768211925
2107263,4,B0002MQFGY,"Received this DVD today. This is a very simple and easy way to train a dog without censure. We just one week ago,  acquired a shelter pup, about 9 monts old. In five minutes after using the first training command to sit, Tasha, (new name too) was sitting when I used only my hand signal. I'm confident that the rest will follow very quickly. I regret that there is nothing about cohabiting with cats!

The only reason I didn't give this DVD 5 stars, is because I found the ""Dogs Point of View"" sections inane, voice over annoying and unecessary as well as the cartoon. Maybe ok for very young children, but they would not likely be doing the training any way.",1140998400,5,659,4.39344262295082
2107264,5,B0002MQFGY,"I'd never had a dog in the past, and knew absoloutely nothing about dog training. This DVD goes over everything, sit, stay, down, come, etc. and has some great games to play with your dog as well as help with the training process. I've already gotten some wonderful results with Jewels and can't wait to use more of Paul Owen's training methods with her.",1140652800,5,354,4.546875
2107275,3,B0002MQFGY,"This DVD was good for for basic training, but as another reviewer wrote, it does not address the alpha  male and how to correct.  I would guess that many people that consider buying this DVD do so because they are having difficulty training their dog.  This is not the video for a less than attentive dog. However, the training segments are good and show step by step directions.  His approach is very kind and non-punative--positive reinforcement only.  My 9 year old daughter loved the DVD and the ""talking dog"" segments at the end of each training session. The menu is very annoying with numerous sub-menus for each topic. Overall, this is not a bad DVD, but it probably won't help you if your dog is difficult to engage.  Watch the Dog Whisperer (Caesar Milan) on National Geographic and enroll your dog in obedience training and you'll be on your way to a better behaved pup!",1140480000,3,880,4.645161290322581
2107276,5,B0002MQFGY,"What a great DVD to watch: Fun, educational, interesting,sientifical substantiated. The best part:No pain to gain reliable behavior on your dog, even in aggression training. Isn't that something!!! Way to go Paul!",1140393600,5,213,5.6875
2107277,5,B0002MQFGY,"Let me start by saying that I believe that this is an outstanding DVD.  I have read all of the reviews and people seem to be either disappointed or very happy with it, not much in between.  If you read the writings of the original Horse Whisperer, John Solomon Rarey, he tells people to teach a horse through gentle and positive methods.  He does not recommend dominance and forcing a horse into situations that scare him.  He does teach one to control the horse but to do it while showing it kindness and gentleness, thereby gaining the horse's trust.  Perhaps some people are anxious to get to the nitty gritty of teaching their dogs behaviors but if you take the time to pay attention to this DVD's topics of Focus and the 3 Ds and Training Influences, you will have much greater success.  These things make up the foundation that the training is built on.  In these, Paul Owens addresses topics such as getting the dogs attention and why your dog may be behaving the way it is.  These methods definitely do work with aggressive dogs.  I have a dog that was wonderful with people and extremely aggressive with other dogs.  He now is fine with other dogs being around him, participating in obedience trials and has many dog friends that he loves to play with.  I have used the more traditional method where the more a dog misbehaves the harder you jerk him.  I have met excellent trainers who use these methods but I prefer the positive, reward based method.  It has brought me a great deal of pleasure and I feel much better rewarding my dog then correcting him.  When you dominate a dog using physical force or aggressive means, you teach it to do what you want when you are there because it fears you.  This does not necessarily make a dog reliable .... one that you can be sure will act the same way when you are not there.  With positive methods you change the way the dog feels about the situation and take away the fear and threat which allows the dog to learn a behavior.  When he is comfortable with a situation he will act appropriately even when you are not there.  These methods may be different from what you have grown up with but if you approach them in an open way, you will find them much more rewarding for both you and your dog.  This is a great DVD for learning dog training.  Study it to understand it and you will be able to use the methods you learn here to teach your dog many things beyond what is shown.  Being positive really works.",1139961600,10,2461,4.400442477876106
2107278,5,B0002MQFGY,"For an individual or family who is getting a new puppy this is the best DVD out there.  Not only is it fun to watch but it is also very educational and informative.  The techniques described in the DVD are detailed and very helpful.  My 12 week Bichon Frise puppy has already learned to sit, lie down, go to his bed, go over and under and get his toy, and I learned how to teach these to my puppy by watching the DVD and applying the techinques.  An added bonus is that the DVD goes over fun games that you could play with your puppy and dog, that they love playing, such as peek-a-boo and hide-and-seek.

Again I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking to train their puppy or dog.",1139875200,6,693,4.180451127819549
2107279,3,B0002MQFGY,"I have two very aggressive dogs and was looking for information on how to handled them. I bought this video because of the name and was disappointed to find it was the typical dog training video and is not about being a real dog whisperer. It focuses on standard techniques which can be applied if your dog is trainable. It doesn't address the pack mentality, or how to assert oneself as the alpha member with your dog(s). The dogs' psyche is not addressed nor what drives their behavior. If you have a submissive dog, the techniques in this video will be helpful.  If your dog is competing with you for the alpha position you'll need another video that addresses that.",1139875200,8,669,4.575
2107280,5,B0002MQFGY,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD!  Not only was it a great tool to train my dog in a positive way, but I had a ball watching it (the cartoons and skits in there were great!).  This is a terrific way to introduce you to the world of dog training in a non-threatening, encouraging way, and every dog owner who wants a well-trained dog should own this DVD.",1139702400,5,350,4.208955223880597
2107281,3,B0002MQFGY,"Let me start by saying I am an avid dog lover and work in the veterinary field. The Dog Whisperer DVD is designed to help beginners with training their dogs, however I wasn't really impressed with the material. I felt like there was about 30% useful material on the DVD as far as training your pet and discouraging behaviors. The rest was all ""funny"" skits and fluff. I was also surprised to find that he never mentioned crate training or even housebreaking. Considering that most people would be buying this maybe after getting a new puppy, I was really surprised that neither of these topics were discussed on the DVD. Not only was I not satisfied with the material on the DVD but it was really boring to watch and I thought the menus were a little more complex than they needed to be to navigate. I recommend you watch Cesar Millan (The Dog Whisperer)on the National Geographic channel for training tips and buy his new book once its released.  This DVD will most likely be more helpful to people who have absolutely no clue about training a dog or have never owned a dog before.  For the rest of you, just look elsewhere.",1138924800,14,1125,4.509803921568627
2107282,5,B0002MQFGY,"What a wonderful DVD! Paul Owens has this friendly demeanor in which he introduces that training your dog really is fun. I always felt that if a dog is happy they won't chew things or do bad things, but since I didn't understand how a dog's thinking process was I really didn't know what to do. Paul gets our own senses going--he makes us feel. Okay, I cried at the ""Man's Best Friend"" short he has in there. The simplicity and truth of it got to me. At the end of the DVD I realized that I felt like a kid again--which is exactly the part of me who trains my ""Rita"". She wants what I want and it's that simple. This DVD should be mandatory for every dog owner and I am not exaggerating!",1137888000,8,687,4.0962962962962965
2107283,3,B0002MQFGY,"I liked the positive reinforcements in this DVD, and I did get a few training tips.

But I was hoping for something a little more in depth...potty training, behavior modification, etc.  This video covers basics like sit, fetch, down etc.  The cartoons and all are fluff and really don't add to what I was looking for....which is training my dog.",1135555200,11,345,4.716666666666667

Each command we ask from our dogs is outlined here in a clear and concise manner, easy to follow and understand. As a television producer, I was impressed with the high production value of the film and fully enjoyed a surprise animated short. Paul's wealth of experience and love of dogs shines through and makes it fun and stressfree to learn how to get our dogs to do what we want them to do with positive reinforcement.",1128470400,10,540,4.520408163265306
2107305,5,B0002MQFGY,"Fun and informative, this DVD encompasses everything that a dog owner should know about teaching their dog the basics in a simple, easy-to-follow format.  Not only does it include basic commands, but it includes some intermediate commands, as well as tricks!

I found it refreshing that this DVD opens with Mr. Owens discussing relaxation techniques for the owner.  Many training programs simply focus on the dog, omitting just how much the owner's attitude and overall approach to training influences the training/learning experience for the dog.

The sections covering basic behaviors, such as sit and down, are entertaining as well as educational.  Mr. Owens explains his techniques at a pace that anyone can follow.  Be sure to check out the portions of each behavior from the perspective of the dog!  I've never seen an approach like this before, and it was great!

The production value of this DVD is brilliant.  Unlike some traning videos out there, this is a very high quality DVD.  The video, audio, menus, and graphics are top of the line.

In portions of the video, it seems as if some of the dogs in the video have had prior advanced training.  Don't let this discourage you- especially if you are just beginning the training process.  I believe Mr. Owens intends to convey (through all these VERY well-behaved dogs) exactly what can be accomplished using positive reinforcement techniques.  No pet owner can expect to get a perfect 'down from a distance' from only one or two training sessions.  However, if you  practice consistently using Mr. Owen's techniques, you will eventually get there!

Although my dog has learned most of the commands, using the hand signals will help with her continued training.  My dog is a fairly strong Alpha female, and is trying very hard to keep her role as the dominant force in the family, this training will reinforce that I am her leader. The only negatives I have about the video is that barking was not touched upon, nor housetraining (and accidents), kennel training, obnoxious behavior (humping). Those are some of the behaviors we have had to seek assistance from a professional behavior coach.  Not having an Alpha dog before, this is a real challenge.",1116547200,17,756,4.8

2107313,2,B0002MQFGY,"We were very disappointed based on what we thought we were ordering.  The title is misleading.  ""Dog Whisperer"" and ""Beginning"" dog training fall a bit short of my expected content.

""Whisperer"" should involve emulating how the animal interacts in the wild.  The horse Whisper takes control of the horse by emulating the lead stallion in the herd.  A dog whisperer should be able to control a dog by emulating the alpha dog in the pack.  This DVD illustrates basic treat reward dog training and has nothing do do with dog whispering per my expectation.

""Beginning"" training should include how to house train (not even mentioned in this DVD) and how to get the puppy to stop mouthing/biting when playing (a common behavior that needs fixing).  If the DVD touches on this it is very subtle.  We have a new puppy (3 months old) and need to solve these 2 problems.  This was THE reason for purchasing this DVD but it fell way short.
