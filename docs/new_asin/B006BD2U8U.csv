4982391,5,B006BD2U8U,I just finished the basket in Basket Essentials (completed basket within a week of purchasing the video) and was so excited that I purchased the second dvd (Advanced Basket Weaving).  I have started the Advanced Basket Weaving project and my basket is going as smoothly as the basket in the first video.  Excellent tips.  I have only been weaving since March 2011 but with the excellent tips and video I am working on completeing the basket featured in Advanced Basket Weaving.....so  even if you are a beginner these two videos are for you!,1322006400,3,541,4.78494623655914

8496027,5,B006BD2U8U,"I've spent lots of time searching Youtube tutorials on pine needle basket making and have purchased books on the subject as well.  However, Nadine Spiers' DVD is the finest instructional video I've come across.  Her attention to detail, no holding back sharing of technique, high standards of craftsmanship, and great camera work make the  video a pleasure to watch.  My comments also apply to her first DVD, ""Basket Weaving Essentials,"" which I would recommend to any beginner.",1384300800,4,478,5.1688311688311686
8496028,5,B006BD2U8U,"I purchased Nadine's first DVD, and found it very helpful, answered a lot of questions for me that I couldn't glean from the books on pine needle basketry. Even though I am  still mastering the basics and not quite ready to tackle all of the techniques covered in this Advanced Basketweaving DVD, I went ahead and purchased it so I would be ready.  Nadine has put together another outstanding class in pine needle basketry techniques, showing and explaining every step in the process.  The camera close-ups are excellent.  I feel much more confident of my abilities to tackle some of the advanced techniques now that I have watched this DVD several times.

This Advanced basket weaving DVD covers creating windows in the coils, how to wrap and sculpt floating coils, shaping the basket/vessel, and how to attach beads or other objects to the basket during construction and afterwards.  She offers many tips. Nadine inspires us to take our pine needle basketry in new directions!",1329609600,4,978,4.932926829268292
8496029,5,B006BD2U8U,"I too bought Nadine's first DVD on the basics so was very happy when she came out with the advanced one. If you've learned the basic techniques on her first DVD, you will have no problem with the advanced techniques. Her direction is easy to follow and she makes sure she has close ups so you can see exactly what she is talking about. This DVD will definitely take your skill up to the next level and you will be making beautiful creations. Well worth the investment",1328918400,3,467,4.379310344827586
8496030,5,B006BD2U8U,"I purchased Nadine's first DVD, Basket Weaving Essentials and I anxiously awaited her second DVD - Advanced Basket Weaving. When it arrived I was not disappointed. This DVD also incorporates Nadine's inspirational teaching style and is very easy to follow. The DVD is broken up into easy to follow chapters so you can go back and just review one section as many times as you want. My pine needle baskets have been treated to so many new techniques! The sculpturing and floating coils are often used in my baskets to make them unique works of art, if I do say so myself. You won't go wrong with purchasing both of Nadine's Basketry DVD's.",1328140800,4,637,4.646017699115045
8496031,5,B006BD2U8U,I have purchased this second of Nadine's DVD's and I was not disappointed.  It was as simple to understand and learn as the first DVD.  I have already made three baskets that even impressed my children.  She explains all of the steps needed to complete a project as well as giving you information to allow you to explore your own creativity.  I loved the DVD. Good job Nadine.,1322438400,2,376,4.485294117647059
8496032,5,B006BD2U8U,"This is an awesome DVD that takes your skills to a new level. Inspirational, clear, precise, information and techniques. Nadine excels with added techniques, to encourage even the novice weaver.",1322352000,,194,5.5
