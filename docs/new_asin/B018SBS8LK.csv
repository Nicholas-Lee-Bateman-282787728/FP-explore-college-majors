8742851,5,B018SBS8LK,I just discovered ARROW this year so I'm doing some major catch-up. Love that this covers seasons 1 through 4.  Probably will buy season 5 too since I just discovered that the show on TV is already in season 6! Yikes...,1509062400,,219,4.341463414634147

8742853,3,B018SBS8LK,"Love the series, however there is some issue with the production of these Blu-Rays.  I read a couple of other reviews of people having issues with some of the disks not playing.  I decided to take the chance and order anyway.  At least half the disks in every season had an issue and were unable to play some of the episodes.  I thought the packaging might have been responsible, however the disks were pristine.  I ended up returning the set.",1499472000,3,443,4.4875
8742854,5,B018SBS8LK,"As with other shows, movies, comics, books, and other media that feature the vigilante, by my gauging, at least part of this is born from the conditions we find ourselves in, that is to say a multi-decades long swath of lawlessness on the part of the ruling class and their confederates. Given this, the popularity of such figures as Batman and Green Arrow are hardly surprising. What is profoundly groundbreaking about the show, even if its main protagonist hails from the same ground, is that it dares to portray onscreen oligarchs from various quarters and their brutal plans for the rank and file. By my gauging we only need more of this.

As for the packaging, it is all cardboard, meaning cardboard sleeves and not the plastic bases onto which you can click in place discs. My uniform experience with the cardboard sleeves is that scratch the discs and things get worse over time. This product gives you the four discs at discounted prices, but, if you want your discs to last it is worth it to purchase the seasons separately. Anyway, my take on this product.",1497744000,,1066,4.7005347593582885
8742855,5,B018SBS8LK,This Set Is Amazing For Its Reasonable Price The Only Thing Probably People Won't Like Is The Fact It Don't Come In Blu-ray Cases They Come In Carboard Cases I Don't Mind It,1493942400,3,173,4.2727272727272725

8742857,3,B018SBS8LK,"I spent 65.00 on this. The end of season 2 skips, and part of 3 has parts where the audio doesn't line up with the actors/actresses. Last disc of season 4 also half plays.",1484179200,8,171,4.0588235294117645
