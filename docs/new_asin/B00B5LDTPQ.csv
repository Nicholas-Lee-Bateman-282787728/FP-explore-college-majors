5559416,5,B00B5LDTPQ,"The first time I saw Carole Lombard in a film was ""Made for Each Other""(1939) which she did with James Stewart. With her heart shaped face, down to earth appeal and funny speaking voice, I was hooked. Since then I've seen many other films she was in and have purchased a lot of them for my collection. I've often wondered about her early work. Now with this new TCM/SONY release called ""CAROLE LOMBARD IN THE THIRTIES""(which covers three films that she made at Columbia) anyone viewing them will get to see how she developed her skills into becoming one of the top actresses during Hollywood's Golden Age. The three films presented in this set were made during the Pre-Code years but are not as controversal like the ones in recent ""Columbia Pre-Code"" box set that was released by TCM last year. Let me say right up front that the picture quality of all three films is superb for films that are 80 years old. The restorers at Sony should be commended for all the hard work that went into making these films look brand new. It's only when the scenes change during the fade outs & ins that you get heavy film grain. First up is ""NO MORE ORCHIDS""(1932) and it's the weakest film of the three. This was in no part due to the screenplay which goes from screwball comedy to drama and finally tragedy. I won't give away anymore of the plot but Lombard is very good as a spoiled heiress. Spoiler alert: the ending of the film might be very disturbing to some considering what happened to Carole Lombard in real life. It doesn't happen to her character but I found it somewhat unnerving all the same. ""NO MORE ORCHIDS"" is 68 minutes and there are no subtitles. ""BRIEF MOMENT""(1933) is terrific and Lombard shines as the nightclub singer and newlywed who only wants the best for her husband despite his party life ways. Lombard really shows her acting talent in this one. That is in no small part due to David Burton's direction. ""BRIEF MOMENT"" is 76 minutes with no subtitles. The third and final picture is ""LADY BY CHOICE""(1934) and Lombard more than holds her own against the scene stealing May Robson. The picture moves along at a fast pace(directed by David Burton again) and is very enjoyable. The supporting cast is great too. ""LADY BY CHOICE"" is 69 minutes with no subtitles. Like TCM previous box set collections, this new one has bonus features that include movie posters, behind the scenes photos, publicity stills,etc. Those who liked the recent TCM box set releases of Jean Arthur will certainly enjoy this set. After all, they both worked at Columbia during the same time period. I purchased this set directly from TCM for $23.99 plus shipping and was not disappointed.",1359244800,26,2674,4.643459915611814
8562956,5,B00B5LDTPQ,"Carole Lombard was a gifted, underrated actress who died at age 33 and was not always given material equal to her talent in both drama and comedy, This three disc set, CAROLE LOMBARD IN THE THIRTIES, contains some of her fine dramatic work in the 1930s. All three movies were made while she was on loan to Columbia Pictures and the prints here look extremely good for movies made between 1932-1934. The brief summaries below are mostly from the dvd beaver review of the set:

No More Orchids (1932)
Lombard plays a spoiled heiress who falls in love with a struggling lawyer despite her arranged marriage to a European prince. What begins as a screwball comedy soon segues into drama tinged with tragedy and Lombards refreshingly natural acting style confirms her promise as a rising star. Variety called the film, A smart, polished production replete with good acting, smooth direction and clever lines. Directed by Walter Lang (The King and I, 1956).

Brief Moment (1933)
The class conscious formula is reversed in Brief Moment (1933) in which Lombard stars as a nightclub singer trying to convince her rich playboy fianc (Gene Raymond) to abandon his party-going lifestyle in favor of a respectable livelihood. Based on a play by S.N. Behrman (Waterloo Bridge, 1940), this romantic drama set against the backdrop of the Great Depression is immensely appealing and, in the words of the New York Times reviewer, is definitely a tribute to the talents of Carole Lombard and Gene Raymond.

Lady by Choice (1934)
With Lady by Choice (1934), the actress gets to shine in one of her best early roles as a fan dancer who adopts a feisty elderly woman (May Robson) with a police record. Following on the success of Frank Capras Lady for a Day (1933, which also starred May Robson), this raucous farce is both an unexpected female buddy movie and a lively portrait of street-smart urbanites trying to survive tough times. The tart dialogue is courtesy of talented screenwriter Jo Swerling (John Ford's The Whole Towns Talking, 1935).

Although none of these films are well known, all are worth seeing. Brief Moment is a pleasant and enjoyable drama from the period. No More Orchids has a haunting ending that is unlike any film I have seen, and Lady By Choice is highly enjoyable -- I watched this last one the day after I saw Capra's Lady For A Day, both of which star May Robson but Lombard's film is not derivative of the earlier film by Frank Capra. In some ways, I enjoyed Lady By Choice more, seeing Carole Lombard and May Robson play off each other.

It's not difficult to fall in love with Carole Lombard for her talent and her beauty, both of which are on display in this set of three films which are available for the first time on DVD.",1529798400,,2738,4.707724425887265

8562958,5,B00B5LDTPQ,"Carole Lombard never disappoints. These are fantastic films. with melodrama, drama, comedy and screw ballish comedy. Lombard always looks and acts as if it were now. 2017. and yet captures the elusive idea of the time she lived in with ease, expertise, allure, and pure talent.

Amazing transfers, wonderful bonuses, and Carole singing and doing a provocative fan dance.",1499212800,,370,5.271186440677966

8562960,5,B00B5LDTPQ,"You need to own this box set. It is a wonderful introduction to Carole Lombard and her work in the early 30s.

No More Orchids
This is an early talkie with Carole Lombard, one of the most popular stars of the 30s. Rich, spoiled girl falls in love with a nobody. Drama with romantic comedy and plenty of double entendres mixed in. Complex conflict and a good story make this film well worth watching. Lombard is always good, and she makes this movie engaging and entertaining. You will enjoy this movie.

Brief Moment
Rich boy wants to marry a night club singer, but the family is appalled at their sons choice. This is a romance with plenty of conflict. Lombard and Raymond are excellent. Lombard was great in her comedies, but she is powerful in her role in this film. You cant come away from this film without an appreciation for Carole Lombards talents. I highly recommend this film.

Lady by Choice
To drum up publicity a night club fan dancer adopts an old lady from a senior home on Mothers Day. Turns out shes a handful. This is a pleasant dramedy but not as engaging as some of Lombards other films. Lombard always sparkles though. Well worth watching.",1468368000,,1160,4.54066985645933

8562963,5,B00B5LDTPQ,"Had to snatch this set up upon release and without any customer reviews available. If you are a Lombard fan this is a must have set of three rarely seen and previously unavailable films that shouldn't have been forgotten. The offerings are No More Orchids (1932), Brief Moment (1933), and Lady By Choice (1934). Considering the age of these films, i was amazed how well they were transferred to DVD. The sound is good but more remarkably the films themselves aren't grainy except in transitions between scenes at times.
The obscurity of these films as well as their time frame which covers the pre-code era which saw its demise in 1934, takes Lombard's rep as a saucy performer as well her delivery of flip one-liners into consideration and cements her rep as an adept comedienne and explains exactly why she was so popular with film audiences of the time.
I'd be hard pressed to name a favorite, but No More Orchids distinguishes itself as a comedy/drama and proves that Lombard was as versatile a dramatic actress as she was a vivacious comedienne. Given certain elementsin the plot that foreshadow Lombard's untimely death, I found this film unintentionally haunting. Probably adding to everything, I hiked out to the Lombard crash site at Mt. Potosi near Las Vegas with a couple of friends two years ago. More than just a curiousity, it was a graveyard that had been savaged by visitors over 68 years and was a sobering experience that illustrates how quickly life can go wrong. Of course, Lombard who has been dead for all these years, proves to be still appealing and fresh as when these films were made 80 years ago.
Overall, these films have interesting supporting character actors and actresses that are mostly forgotten today except by old movie fans.
All three films are good examples of why Lombard still has a strong following today and they were a treat to see. Lombard was immensely popular ad she is absolutely stunning in these films.
As for the cost of this set, it is reasonable. i bought it elsewhere for under $30 with free shipping and would definitely buy it again and buy any other future offerings featuring Lombard through Sony without hesitation.
As an aside, I just received an advance publication ebook titled Fireball by Robert Matzen which is scheduled for a March, 2014 release. This book looks at Lombard's death and its aftermath as well as the crash of Flight 3. I will review it on Amazon after its release. This may be of interest to Lombard fans and from what I've already read of the book it is extremely good.",1379635200,23,2549,4.743243243243243
8562964,5,B00B5LDTPQ,"Mom loves it and is glued to it. Made her so happy, I am happy. A wonderful collection for a fan!!!",1371340800,5,99,3.761904761904762
8562965,5,B00B5LDTPQ,"This Carole Lombard collection is compiled and sold by TCM.  I recommend buying from TCM directly as the cost of this collection is cheaper at wholesale price (in still new condition), and sometimes on sale.  As for the collection itself it is marvelous for Carole Lombard fans, and those who are new to Carole Lombard. It showcases her early (and more rarer) films from the early 1930s prior to ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936). Each film is restored, crisp, clear, and nice to watch. The DVDs are sturdy and come in a nice sturdy case with Carole Lombard artwork. This collection is in glorious black and white. As a Carole Lombard fan myself (to the point of visiting the actual TWA Flight #3 crash site where she perished) I highly recommend this film.  I found ""No More Orchids"" (1932) to be my favorite of the three. I give all three films five out of five stars, and this collection in total five out of five stars. A great collection consisting of three great films for both Carole Lombard and 1930s/1940s classic film fans.",1368921600,12,1023,4.6098901098901095
