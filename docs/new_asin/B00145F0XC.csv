8254509,3,B00145F0XC,"This film was based on a book written by a college professor and his assistant following their research into the sex trade that followed the military during WWII (there are actually two films one about Hawaii and one about the rest of the Pacific).  It was all about how the military employed prostitutes for the service men traveling through Honolulu during WWII.  The hookers were paid about $3.00 per customer, a price set by the military.  The Hawaii law enforcement officers were in charge of making sure the prostitutes stayed in the red light district and did not try to go into business for themselves, or live among the ""respectable"" citizens.

I read the book also and it detailed the scandal of a brutal beating given to one of the ""comfort"" workers by the Honolulu police when she was discovered staying in a Waikiki hotel that was off limits to her.  Her jury trial lasted a very short time and all charges were dropped against her due to the terrible beating she had received.  The film however left out the parts about how the police beat the poor woman nearly to death, then threw her in jail, and it tried to put the best light on the entire situation of the exploitation of these young women, it basically said these women were making money hand over fist and blamed the lack of morals entirely on them while making light of the corruption in the military ranks and the police force.

It was an interesting film, but it was done for the History Channel so was compelled to leave out any of the negative details.  The best part was the old films and pictures of the hundreds of service men lined up around the block day and night to take their turn and pay their $3.00.

For the most part people do not know anything about these military ""private contractors"" installed around the world throughout our history to service the service men.  So it's a glimps into the seedy side of the armed forces.  My only criticism is the candy coated nature of the film, leaving the audience with the impression that it was a rollicking good time for all.",1371254400,2,2057,4.547425474254743
