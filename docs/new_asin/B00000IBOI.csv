7910388,5,B00000IBOI,"This is the second installment to the first Gundam trilogy.  The movie is edited version of a TV show that is 20 years old, but the depth of the story and the characters far exceeds some of anime or even sci-fi movies today.  This is the anime that changed the history of anime.  This is the must see not only for anime fans, but those who thinks anime is for kids.",992908800,2,365,4.112676056338028

7910390,5,B00000IBOI,"I've always loved the original Gundam series. And I think they're better then all the other gundams like gundam wing, 0080, f-91, etc.
This is a must see video for all of you who want to relive the past and bring back  some old gundam memories. Or for those who don't know what a gundam is or  for those who want to know how they first originated.",953942400,4,347,4.164179104477612
7910391,4,B00000IBOI,"When I saw Gundam one, frankly I was a bit disapointed. Though I love Gundma and the ""manga"" was great, the old animation was...just hard to catch up on, and believe me I used to watch those things when I was  a little kid living in Japan. But still, now that Im older you do still  want some more quality then animation like this.
Turns out Im wrong,  becuase Volume 2, is just great. The animation though still low quality is  genrally ""convincing"" and the humans and interactions are realer  than ever. Its not so easy to make someone impressed by poor animation, in  fact the people were so convincing that I almost forgot about it being  animated.
Think of it this way, Star Wars is great. But would it have  done so good if it was ANIMATED? Gundam did good even though it was  animated and cheap. (sorry I put it in bad context) but the point is that  any GUNDAM FAN would appreciate this. Anime fans used to ""Ghost in the  SHell"" and high quality stuff might find this a bit hard to get used  to, but believe me, if you're watching Anime for something more than it  being ""animated"" then you won't regret buying VOLUME TWO OF MOBILE  SUIT GUNDAM.",950745600,5,1153,4.352112676056338
