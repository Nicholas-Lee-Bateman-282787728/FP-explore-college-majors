7989252,5,B000094Q1E,"A charming period piece on many levels- a look at the 1890's from the perspective of the 1970's. Pleasant songs, none of which go on too long (except one- on purpose) and a very capable cast. The romantic lead is Daniel Davis, who might surprise those who know him as Niles the butler in THE NANNY, or Professor Moriarity on STAR TREK. Likewise Charlotte Rae (from THE FACTS OF LIFE) reveals a remarkably good singing voice behind her comic facade. The quality of the image is quite good, with the usual dificulties of shooting a live performance. There is one tape glitch about midway through, but I'm thankful that this minor gem survived.",1095724800,6,641,4.68141592920354
