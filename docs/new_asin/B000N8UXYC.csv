2760935,4,B000N8UXYC,"I saw the English broadcast of this series and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a heartwarming view of small village life complete with all of the quirky types of characters you might expect.  Think Calendar Girls, with its focus on the local Women's Institute (called the Women's Guild in Clatterford). I read one review that aptly compared it to Northern Exposure.  The BBC has done the series as much harm as good by promoting it as ""by the creator of Absolutely Fabulous,"" Jennifer Saunders.  This is not AbFab and one shouldn't expect anything like that.  But Jennifer Saunders continues to be a master at taking common events, situations, or conversations and embellishing them to the brink of absurdity.  This series can provide plenty of smiles, but don't expect hilarity.  It wasn't written that way.",1173657600,104,805,5.007518796992481

2760943,5,B000N8UXYC,"I watched the whole tape - all 6 episodes and the bonus Christmas piece - in one sitting and loved it.  I'm a huge fan of Dawn French (who doesn't love The Vicar of Dibley?) and Jennifer Saunders and their talent is evident here.  By the end of watching, I felt like I was friends with every character.

2760949,5,B000N8UXYC,"I enjoy British comedies and asked for this DVD set for Christmas because I knew several of the actresses in it, and of course, knew Jennifer Saunders wrote it. I have to say, the first episode nearly killed my interest in seeing the rest. Too many characters thrown at me too quickly, and the entire town seemed SO dysfunctional, almost as though everyone in the town had been AbFabbed to death. But the second episode was better and the third even more so, until I began to get the 'heartwarming' element I'd been promised. The show really hits its stride and the rest of the episodes were VERY entertaining and enjoyable. The Christmas Special was indeed SPECIAL. I intend to order the other seasons. The characters are truly three-dimentional, they truly care about each other (even if they have some weird ways of showing it!), and the show truly is a little piece of creative genius. TRULY.

The price seems a bit high for 180 minutes, however.",1396656000,,950,4.688622754491018

2760951,4,B000N8UXYC,"I like British comedy. This one isn't one of my favorite, but with that said, I've watched it twice. I love learning how the British people lived and sharing some of their daily activities. This is a serier but funny dvd.",1376524800,,221,4.414634146341464
2760952,5,B000N8UXYC,"Originally aired as Jam and Jerusalem in the U.K. for four seasons, this show is hilarious. Join a group of women in a fictional town in Devonshire, or the country of Devon in the West country, a beautiful place there, as they make jam, bake bread and share confidences over death and other secrets. This is a wonderful television series written by and created by Jennifer Saunders. It also stars Saunders, Joanna Lumley and Dawn French. It's a real shame that the BBC didn't renew it for a fifth season and after. Of course, in a male dominated profession such as television, it was a miracle this series even made it on air.
Overall, this is a witty, candid and entertaining show. I could think of worse ways to while away the time. I have no problem recommending it to others.",1376352000,,779,4.531914893617022
2760953,5,B000N8UXYC,"Anything penned by Jennifer Saunders is fantastic.  This series is a bit offbeat, even for her.  It is a very engaging group of actors and they play their parts to the hilt.  A very, very good series.",1369008000,,200,4.351351351351352
2760954,5,B000N8UXYC,Clatterford or (Jam and Jersusalem) is one of my favorite British television comedies of all time. The show is absolutely amazing and I laughed soooo much. I was so sad once it came to an end and I had seen all the episodes. You really grow attached to all of the characters. This show is a must have for any fan of British Comedy,1362268800,,330,4.171875

2760956,5,B000N8UXYC,"During the first episode I wasn't sure how I felt about this show, but by the second episode I was hooked. The inhabitants of Clatterford seem so real, you begin to feel you live there, too. I'm not sure if men would enjoy this very British series, but women of a certain age should love it. The problems and pleasures of small town life are all here: dealing with grown children, losing a spouse, annoying neighbors, and friendship. I plan to buy seasons two and three as soon as possible!",1360108800,,490,4.455555555555556
2760957,5,B000N8UXYC,"I am a 45 yer old happily married American man. I love the brazen pop culture skewering done on Ab Fab. I love the outrageous gutterpunk mayhem of The Young Ones. And yet, I also love the subtle complexity of Jam & Jerusalem (aka; Clatterford). It makes me very happy that Jennifer Saunders did not accept the easier road of juvenile humor for her entire career, but rather stuck her neck out with this mature series. IMHO these are some of the most multi-faceted female characters ever broadcast on television. I honestly feel sorry those who can't seem to find the humor here. Dawn French plays one of her most outlandish characters ever, and yet there is an underlying humanity that is quite poignant. The receptionist Tip, is like one of those people you know in real life who's the kind of fallible smart-ass that always brightens your day and keeps your reality checked at the same time. Saunders herself is not the star of this show, but her upper class character often delivers malaprop zingers by confusing sexual fetish terminology with everyday activities. Joanna Lumley admirably goes the farthest afield by digging down and portraying someone 30 years her senior in an unflattering, but entirely honest light. This is not a JOKE show. It's not sketches or slapstick. Rather it's a brilliantly written and insightful drama with great humor that comes about as close to real life as any TV show is likely to.",1356912000,3,1419,4.795918367346939
2760958,5,B000N8UXYC,"If you are a die-hard Ab-Fab fan, you may not like Clatterford.  Although, both are the children of the brilliant British comedianne, Jennifer Saunders (and she stars in both), Clatterford is more low-key dramatic fare that reminds me a little of the movie ""Cosi.""  Joanna Lumley, Dawn French, and Jennifer Saunders play third-tier comedy relief characters to Sue Johnston's ""Sal Vine,"" the wife of the small village's only doctor.  Three series of this show (initially called ""Jam and Jerusalem"") spin the fun had by the women who inhabit the village and are members of the local women's society.  Pay special attention to whatever Jennifer Saunders' character says; it's usually something of a double-entendre that she completely misses.",1355443200,,739,5.2905982905982905

bumping into each other...and since when is a SEASON three hours...and not three full hours!
The third season ends with no explanation...I LOVE PBS but this is as bad as any inane American TV garbage..The writer has run out of steam..not worth watching let alone paying for it. I am
really stunned at just how pointless this whole thing is. Lots of talent wasted. Best thing is the scenery. My first real disappointment in over 40 yrs of PBS AWFUL.",1329264000,4,528,4.688172043010753
2760960,3,B000N8UXYC,"I was looking forward to a new comedy but what I got was Comedy that has been done too many times before on TV. And I as much as I hate to say it, I really wouldn't spend money on it. I watched the one I got sent from Netflix.
Actually some of the comedy reminded me of ""French & Saunders"" comedy back in the 80's. It had some charm and beautiful scenery. And some really bad jokes! One in Particular almost stopped me in my tracks to keep watching, Dawn French puts on Mens Clothes(that belonged to someone who died very recent)in the House of Wife, and I was in shock, not seeing any funny side at all. Sorry girls, I love British Comedy and Love British Tv, but this show was awful at least for comedy. Maybe as a drama it might pass?",1319760000,,737,4.089655172413793

2760962,1,B000N8UXYC,"It's comforting to know that the US networks aren't the only ones producing inane sitcoms.

2760963,5,B000N8UXYC,"There are some people who are so good at what they do that you can't even see the tracks they leave behind in the sand.  You have to just marvel - you can't figure out how they do it - and you can't even take it in the first time you see it.
Sort of like the Bible!  That's how highly I regard Jennifer Saunders...  And frankly I find myself quoting some lines in Ab Fab at so many points of transition in life that she might as well be one of the apostles...  I've been a long time fan of Absolutely Fabulous - it has a Rocky Horror sort of perfection whereby you could watch each episode 20 times and only realize more and more how each word, each gesture, has sort of an integrated perfection that transcends the immediate meaning of the line or plot.  I read the scripts for some of the AbFab episodes and they are such skeleton sketches that it
made me even more of an admirer of how much Jennifer Saunders holds in her head and brings to life in the actual performance.
  Hungry for more, I purchased the first two seasons of Clatterford.  I like many before me had to come to an understanding
that this is about the genius of Jennifer Saunders, which transcends Absolutely Fabulous - if you don't understand that then
you will be disappointed that everything else she does is not just sketch comedy that rises to that broad level.  I watched
Season One last night, already aware that I had to watch it with no expectations, and I watched with a dawning revelation
that she can facilely transfer her abilities to other styles and genres.  As an inhabitant of a large city, just the concept that people have to really live with each other in a small town was a revelation....  The way she actually fleshes that out and brings it to life was remarkable on many levels - I did find myself laughing out loud on several occasions - sometimes at the situation, sometimes at her brilliance in delivering it..and watched the rest with a sense of wonder at
her subtlety.
  It speaks to her genius that the other reviewers here have done such an intelligent job of reviewing Clatterford. Buyer beware that the more intelligent the viewer is the more refined and transcendent their experiences with Jennifer Saunders and crew will be. Enjoy.",1304294400,,2236,4.464373464373464
2760964,5,B000N8UXYC,"Another wonderful season of this extremely well written britcom.
The cast becomes even more comfortable in there roles and is so believable. As in the first season, the camera work brings you in the scenes as though you were there. This is not your average campy britcom. It is fantastic!!",1300579200,,289,4.8

could not believe what we just witnessed, LET ALONE PAID FOR.

It was almost like witnessing a UFO...only THAT would be exciting.

It IS soooo DULL and BORING! OMG It Stinks soooo bad..

My GF and I are HUGE fans of Dawn French and Jenifer Saunders and NOT Area 51.

BUT....The STENCH of KRAP-er-FORD was almost surreal.

We actually got high cause it STUNK so bad.

A self respecting Turd Beetle would have wretched it's maggoty breakfast after what we just watched.

My kind, loving, soft spoken girl friend and BIG TIME fan of Saunders and French stared at me dumbfounded....""What the HELL did we just watch?"" She quietly asked.

and...THEN...We both said in concert....

""How can we WARN other... innocent...unsuspecting Saunders/French fans of the putrefying STENCH called Krap-er-Ford.

Please...do not listen to the 36 (or more) straight jacketed patients (or was it the cast) who gave this TRAIN WRECK 5 STARS....

THEY NEED HELP.

I mean....look at this scene...the main character finds her middle aged husband dead at his desk. Shocking? Yes. Funny? Nope. Not at all.

However...she is all GIDDY and GU GU smiles at the funeral for him (I wanted to hack that stupid smile off her face with a machete)....that is...until her son, during his dads eulogy in the church, plugs...that he will be taking over his dad's doctors practice with HIS OWN wife. As the giddy smile of the main character slowly fades away because she realizes just now....no..not that her husband and lifelong soul mate is gone. oh no...its because she is out of a job...and forced into retirement. AWWW...poor baaaby.

KRAP-er-Ford is NOT funny....and NOT at all INTERESTING.

Even if it wasn't funny...I'd expect at least interesting...You'll GET NEITHER!

2760974,5,B000N8UXYC,"I read about this series a while back in the newspaper and had to wait for it to come out on DVD to see it. It was worth the wait.

It is about people living in a small town somewhere in England - mostly the women in the church lady group. There are many characters in the show - including Dawn French as a woman with multiple personalities who works in a cheese factory. The show is comic, but dramatic at times as well.

I think that some of the people in the show are not actors but are from the town where the show is shot. There are very amusing too.

It is a little hard to explain the show beyond this, but it is very good. If you like British TV, give it a try.",1279497600,3,669,3.8686131386861313
2760975,5,B000N8UXYC,This is top-notch  British humour with tender and dramatic moments interspersed throughout. Possibly  bit confusing to those who are not British or Anglophiles.,1264809600,3,160,5.913043478260869
2760976,5,B000N8UXYC,"Jennifer Saunders is a genius and I'll lick anyone who says otherwise. She has achieved new heights with the Clatterford series, which she writes and also acts in. This series has it all-Dawn French in a true comedic acting role and funnier than ever, both understated AND broad humor, brilliant writing and quirky but fleshed-out characters that you can't help but care about. I want to live in Clatterford and join the Guild! I own seasons 1 and 2 and can't wait for season 3 to make it across the pond.",1264550400,4,505,4.56043956043956
2760977,5,B000N8UXYC,Absolutely hilarious.  Just love Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders anyway so this was icing on a cake.  Makes me laugh so much and Joanna Lumley is a sight to see.  Sorry she didn't go into the second series as she was one of the funniest in the show.,1258761600,3,251,4.1875
2760978,5,B000N8UXYC,"My husband and I think this is in the top of the best of the best of television programming. I'm adding his opinion, as some might call this series a ""chick flick series"" but we wouldn't agree with that. It's a series that an intelligent, thoughtful adult will like - and there are plenty of men who qualify for that designation.

I don't know how to keep my superlatives under control - the writing is amazing for a start. Jennifer Saunders has outdone herself - she's managed to take on some serious subjects under the guise of humor, and she pulls it off spectacularly. These stories simply must be the result of intelligent observation of fellow human beings - warts and kindnesses, follies and wisdom - written by someone who knows how to write. Then these brilliant scripts are given to actors who can, follow me now, actually act! They create well rounded, fully realized human beings. We are with them all the way. We like them! We empathize with them. Most of us have known people like them, and if not, would very much like to do so. And we appreciate that they care for each other, and despite eccentricities, support each other through the tough times of life. In a believable way, mind you. The people are congruent all the way through and the scripts tell stories that flow naturally and easily from the characters. No problem handing over that ""suspension of disbelief"" in this case.

I can't leave out the amazing Joanna Lumley - honestly, I laughed every time she came on the screen. And there is a scene between James and his former headmistress involving a pap smear that is maybe the funniest thing ever performed on television. I can't even think about it without breaking into chuckles. The script is beyond wonderful and the actors do it justice with every word and facial expression. Thank you so much - the world doesn't always allow for a good belly laugh, and if I could, I'd anoint you with every award possible for this scene alone. And it isn't alone!

I can't recommend this DVD enough. I have told myriad friends and relatives and done everything I can to get it out and about and seen in the states. By the way, do you know how many times I've used the words ""intelligent"" and ""television"" in the same sentence? Maybe 5 times ever?! Okay, maybe 6 times, but that may be pushing it. See this series. Treat yourself. And thank you, Jennifer Saunders - for this you deserve to be remembered forever - this is way better than anything you've done previously - and that's going some!",1252108800,7,2511,4.575555555555556

I say give it a chance.  This series is sweet and funny. The series is filled with great actresses and the writing is done well.  I can see members of my own local churches women's fellowship in each of these characters.  It may seem like a mundane series, but it really showcases small town life and the women in them, funnier and better than any reality show could.

Being used to the outrageousness of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" and the ""Vicar of Dibley"" this show is more restrained and in its own way, funny.  How Jennifer Saunders can create so many rich, original characters is amazing to me.

She is a genius! Joanna Lumley is hilarious as the old, deaf Delilah Stagg, and Dawn French is wonderful as the village idiot (I use the term with affection)! All the actors are top-notch, the scenery is beautiful, and the theme music is excellent!

People are right when they say this series is no Absolutely Fabulous - that is true, but this series is every bit on par with that series...it just goes in a slightly different direction!

Jennifer Saunders has written a very warm, very real series about the lives of women who are a group firstly because they all belong to the Women's Institute, or the Guild as it is called in Clatterford.  But they care for each other apart from the Guild and it is in that realm that we have a group of people that you care about too; you want to know about them. There are moments of quiet gentleness that bring you close to tears and there are moments of quiet laughter. (This is not the Jennifer Saunders you may THINK you know) The series captures the human spirit as it truly is.  Every character enhances the series; I can't imagine the series without any of them in there.  It's a shame American television cannot, or will not, bring this quality of TV to us.  I have watched series one at least three times and cannot get enough of it.  Jennifer Saunders has a reputation for writing off-the-wall things (think ""Ab-Fab""); not so with Clatterford.

What a bummer.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clatterford-Season-1/dp/B000N8UXYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clatterford - Season 1</a>",1210809600,6,531,6.422535211267606
2761001,5,B000N8UXYC,"This is not the comedy you may expect from this particular group of ladies. But it is real life in a small rural farm town. If you're looking for the typical AbFab type humor, you probably won't like this. It's just very real, touching, funny and sometimes ridiculous; like life.",1210291200,4,279,4.6
2761002,5,B000N8UXYC,"Jam and Jerusalem, as it's called in the UK, has a wonderfully large ensemble of actresses and actors (mostly the former!) who live, work, play, and attend Guild meetings in their small English town.  As hilarious as AbFab in it's own way the show touches on more universal situations and occurrences than those of Eddy, Saffy, and Patsy.  It may not be as crazy as AbFab (what could be?) but it's great fun and shows a genuine respect for each character, foibles and all.

I love Maggie Steed as Eileen, chairwoman of Clatterford St. Mary Guild, who takes it all so seriously and has a phobia about relinquishing even a smidgen of authority to anyone (lest they wrest the Guild from her control, which no one wants to do anyway).  Jennifer Saunders plays the affluent, boring Caroline, whose never-seen son Mikie is in a rock band (not a ""pop band!"") and whose daughter Freida (played by Saunder's daughter Freida) couldn't care less about the equestrian goals set for her by her mother.  Dawn French plays simple Rosie, a worker in a cheese factory who regularly gifts others with large blocks of plastic-wrapped cheese, and has another identity called Margaret who regularly antagonizes and scares Rosie (and makes for several amusing and affecting situations).  Patrick Barlow is the oft-disgruntled and snippy Vicar who tells the grandson of the deceased at a funeral ""Now shut up and sit down!"" and shrilly decrees ""no tins or packets!"" on the church altar for the annual harvest feast.

There are many other great people in this show but Pauline McLynn as Tip, Sally Phillips as Tash, and Rosie Cavaliero as Kate (whose introduction as a drop-in, ersatz grief counselor for Sue Johnston as Sal is priceless -- ""No, you've got to do them [the stages of coping with the death of a loved one] in the right order."") also stand out.

I think I've mixed up season 1 and 2 so you best buy season 2 as soon as it's out!",1207440000,7,1918,4.6875
2761013,5,B000N8UXYC,"Hard to describe. A ""Twin Peaks"" with a twist of ""Northern Exposure"", steeped in British humor kind of show. The large cast includes a rather suburban Jennifer Saunders, an unrecognizable Joanna Lumley, and the village mental case, Dawn French. This isn't ""Absolutely Fabulous"", ""French & Saunders"", or ""The Vicar of Dibley"".

At first I didn't like it, but the more I think about it, the more I laugh. I guess that's part of why I gave it 5 stars. I haven't been able to get it out of my head. From the face of Jesus on a potato to the germophobic nurse, this show is, well, different. Different, but funny nonetheless.",1201651200,9,620,4.585585585585585

2761015,1,B000N8UXYC,"Far from being a delightful expose on 'eccentrics' in an old English village, I found this to be about 'twitty' characters depicted here by usually superb performers playing parts which belied their true professional dignity and capabilities (e.g. the spaced-out Dawn French in 'Clatterford' is really a lively, witty, intelligent, agile actress in other series).  The historic settings are gorgeous but a poor script and mis-use of actors' talents made this demeaning show a failure for me.",1195862400,11,491,5.376623376623376
2761016,5,B000N8UXYC,What can I say? These women are the most talented comedy writers of our day! I would watch it over and over again. It's a joy to turn other people on to this treasure!,1194739200,9,167,3.9411764705882355
2761017,5,B000N8UXYC,"As the other reviewers have stated, this is sooooo not AbFab*. In fact, it is the antithesis of AbFab. It's about a country community (in Devon) of people who, while having their differences, care deeply for each other. It's closer to ""Vicar of Dibley"" (albeit, more subtle) or a somewhat kinky British version of the ""Andy Griffith Show"" (but, with the emphasis on women) than it is to ""Northern Exposure"".

For that, you'd have to watch Dawn French's, ""Wild West"", costarring Catherine Tate. Most of the folks of ""St. Gweeb"", a fictional coastal town in Cornwall, are as isolated and insular as the tiny population of ""Cisely"", Alaska...and as quirky/funny.

Back to ""Clatterford"" (or ""Jam & Jerusalem"" in the UK). It is partly filmed on location and makes great use of the lovely countryside of Devon. Heart-meltingly beautiful. The characters will melt your heart as well, while making you laugh at the same time. There is something and someone here for everyone to relate to.

BTW, It is not taped in front of a studio audience and it does not utilize a ""laugh-track""; you'll have to decide, for yourself, when and where to laugh.

*For AbFab fans...a bit of a spoiler...Saunder's ""Caroline"" relates her experiences of socializing with celebs that her ""Eddy"" could only fantasize about. Good stuff.

PS - Pauline McLynn, who plays ""Tip"", has a blog which I follow. They've just finished work on the second series of ""J&J"" yesterday, so....there's more to come!",1193788800,9,1465,4.939024390243903
2761018,5,B000N8UXYC,"The first two episodes were a bit off putting as I thought they were trying hard to be funny. The characters seemed a bit contrived, and the cast was trying too hard. Once beyond that, the show really gets to your heart and makes for enjoyable and engaging viewing. Not a lot of belly laughs, but good acting and interesting enough story lines do develop. Enjoyable and recommended! Looking forward to season two, if there is one in the pipeline.",1190332800,9,446,4.5875
2761019,5,B000N8UXYC,"Hugh fan of Jennifer Saunders and being over 50 I found her new series delightful.

2761020,5,B000N8UXYC,"This program is absolutely fabulous, though nothing like Absolutely Fabulous.  Jennifer Saunders is part of the cast, but in a very understated way.  Joanna Lumley is nearly unrecognizable.  Doreen Mantle, Pauline McLynn, Sue Johnston and Dawn French will be familiar to American audiences from other Britcoms, but one soon forgets their other characters.  Clatterford Village Green Preservation Society (the ""WI"" in all but name), throws a diverse group of women together who have little else to stimulate their imaginations.

Much of the gossip surrounds medical issues, thanks to the doctor's widow, played by Sue Johnston.  She is interested in the ""itchy crotches"" ""smears"" and ""ulcers"" of the Clatterford residents.  Far from being a busy body about it, she seems  genuinely interested and no one hesitates to let her check things out.

The cast of characters is charming and the acting is wonderful.  This is not to be missed, and for this writer, every viewing has revealed deeper, richer layers, hence the decision to own a personal copy.

I sincerely hope that Clatterford (Jam and Jerusalem in the UK) will return for another season or two.  Where AbFab was more or less a running joke, Clatterford is far more original, and anything, but a running joke; it is exquisitely original.",1187654400,8,1293,5.133971291866029
2761021,4,B000N8UXYC,"I think a better comparison for this comedy of eccentric characters in the dales is not ""Absolutely Fabulous"" but James Herriot's long-running series.  Both rely on subtle understatement, occasional laugh-out-loud situations and a fondness for the foibles of the human condition.  There are characters-a-plenty in Clatterford, from a vainglorious vicar to a multiple-personality simpleton to a wannabe hippie whose yurt goes mouldy.  Everybody copes with everyone else the best they can, which is a marvelous lesson for us all.  The cast really inhabit their roles, and you'll remember the characters they bring to life long after the gossamer plots have dissolved in your brain.",1186444800,15,679,5.5

2761045,5,B000N8UXYC,"If I could scream from the top of the tallest Virginia mountain and have others hear me, I would.  I would scream my heart out if only those sitting in New York comfy chairs would acknowledge the fact that the BBC continually, at times without effort, creates amazing television series with what seems like the least amount of effort.  With the new shows coming out on American television lately we either need to have big budgets coupled with big explosions or special effects, big names to topple the ratings, or convoluted plots that keep us guessing till the very ending and still give us nothing - alas, the BBC continues to prove that theory wrong.  Using a small set, justified plots, and big names - but combined efforts, the group from across the pond continues to impress me.  This time, it was with a small, probably unheard dramedy, entitled, ""Clatterford"".

Inspired by the same minds that brought us ""Ab Fab"" and the team of French and Saunders tone it down a bit and bring the country into your own living room.  With a subdued beginning episode that may bring a tear to your eye, it also brings us closer to this small town residence - half ""Vicar of Dibly"" half ""Northern Exposure"" and part ""Gilmore Girls"" lifestyle.  What drew me into this show were the individual stories, the powerfully exemplified characters, and the simplicity of each episode.  You don't go into ""Clatterford"" expecting Jack Bauer to pop out behind these ladies, which is a whole new level of watching television.  ""Clatterford"" uses lackluster technology, beautiful scenery, and female swagger to tell a story that can be relatable to anyone, even if you live in a big city surrounding.  I should mention, that isn't a show for your average male.  Not that I am being negative about this, but the female to male ratio in this program is low - this isn't ""24"" hours in the life of a village, this is reaction vs. consequences coupled by togetherness.  Sounding odd?  These shouldn't seem like random encounters.  This is about a village sustaining what we, as Americans, have forgotten about - our own people.  The village in ""Clatterford"", albeit focused quite a bit on the local church organization, but surprisingly worked together.  There is one episode dedicated to showing how this little gathering supports the little village.  These women may not encounter each other if it weren't for this little group - and it is the gatherings and events that bring us, the audience, as well as these pivotal ladies together.

Oh, and did I mention this show was not just sincere - but also very, very funny.  While I had trouble laughing at Dawn French's character of Rosie (because she is mentally unstable), she provided a small slice of enjoyment as the rest of the cast equally contributed.  Of course, there is one stand out - which is the the central focus of some episodes, but it isn't overbearing.  When I finished the series, I cared about each of the characters individually, which is hard to do with most modern American television series.  Not to be negative about our television, but ""Clatterford"" far exceeds much of what I have seen here in the states.  It is subtle, not everyone will get the intelligent humor, and it is rich in character development - bringing together an entire village to capture our hearts.

Overall, I would have trouble suggesting this television series to everyone, because it can get depressing, it can get involved, and it can get emotional (sans the explosions), all without the help of beefy men.  Sounds impossible doesn't it?  I know most will not get the humor of this program, but for me ""Clatterford"" was a simple show, complex emotion, and well-rounded individuals that bring humanity to a new level.  I loved it.  I could watch this short series again (especially the episode with the Christmas Pantomime).  I will support this show, alas, I just don't think it will see the audience that it needs to in America.

Sign me up for two whole cases of these ladies' jam.

However, although the show is nothing like I thought it would be and really hardly features our 2 main girls from AbFab, it grows on you at an alarming rate and is impossible not to enjoy! The characters are so interesting and they are able to weave a wonderful, real life like story of mostly just everyday things. Sure, there are moments of true silliness, but this series seems to be reaching deeper then most of the more ""comedy"" style series coming from the BBC as of late. You will love this, just don't expect AbFab, and you'll be sad that there are so few episodes.",1180224000,21,728,4.481203007518797
2761048,5,B000N8UXYC,"""Clatterford"" is an intoxicating program with so much going on in the background, repeated viewings never bore. The characterizations are a tribute to the fine acting, but none of that would be possible without the brilliant writing of Jennifer Saunders.

""Clatterford"" demonstrates the multi-tasking of women in the myriads of characters and their interactions, often all taking place at the same time. Beneath the eccentricity and idiosyncratic behaviour lurks a sweetness and kindness as well as a family born of their proximity and communal life.

A few favorites are Tip's efforts to force the doctor to rehire his mother as nurse for the surgery by confronting him with having to do a pelvic exam, or ""smear"" of his old head mistress who is quite a randy woman; Queenie, an elderly member of the Women's Guild and verger at the local vicarage as well as crossing guard, studiously trying to find traffic, even to the point of asking if anyone has seen traffic.

Characters such as Tash, Kate and the Vicar, who annoy almost to the point of screaming, inevitably redeem themselves as we see more of their depth of character.

It is slightly disappointing, and inconvenient, not to have the episode list identified on either disc or the case.

The women of Clatterford are complex and textured so you can't watch an episode just once to fully appreciate them.  And you'll want to watch again just to be in their company.  The humor is subtle and wonderful.  The show warm and engaging.  Somehow Saunders is able to make seemingly simple storylines as lush and colored as the countryside in which they have been filmed.  You won't regret being in the company of this women's guild. The chemistry of this cast is a once-in-a-lifetime combination.  And do give them some time to sink in.  The characters are richly detailed and very human; worth taking the time to get to know.
