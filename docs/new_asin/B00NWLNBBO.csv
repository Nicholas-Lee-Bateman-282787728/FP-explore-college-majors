6683144,5,B00NWLNBBO,"This movie made me laugh so hard I embarrassed myself and everyone that was with me! It isn't just funny, it has great plot lines.",1435190400,6,130,4.24
6683145,5,B00NWLNBBO,"Being a huge fan of David Tennant, I absolutely loved this movie!!! His performace was wonderful as usual, and the movie was both equal parts hilarious, bittersweet; and poignant. This gem of a movie is not to be missed!! Highly reccommend it to everyone of all ages!!! :)",1430006400,14,272,4.6875
6683146,5,B00NWLNBBO,"A good movie, with good performances. Billy Connolly is good as always, and the children were entertaining as well.",1429142400,6,115,5.105263157894737

6683148,1,B00NWLNBBO,"This movie is lousy.....don,t watch it",1428192000,,38,5.5
6683149,2,B00NWLNBBO,"Someone had an idea for a good movie, the problem was they didn't know how to put it to film.
Rosamund Pike acting is pretty good and David Tennant holds back his penchant for over acting. Billy Connolly just isn't convincing and comes across as cardboard.

There appears to be a lot of thought put into the dialog and the movie concept, it is delivered poorly.
Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, I almost decided to stop watching it. I wish I could say Im glad I continued to watch it.

The movie is not terrible but the entire feel of the movie is choppy and unprofessional.",1522454400,,583,4.339449541284404
6683150,5,B00NWLNBBO,Quirky and endearing!,1522195200,,21,6.333333333333333
6683151,5,B00NWLNBBO,Great movie. It was funny in dealing with the problems of real people in our world today. The story of a family going through changes and challenges that we all can relate to.,1521936000,,175,4.333333333333333
6683152,4,B00NWLNBBO,"I actually watched this movie with my kids and then had a great conversation about family, last wishes, and how to fight productively instead of hatefully.  This movie is well-acted, which saves it.  In the hands of lesser actors, you would hate all the characters.  With this group, you kind of feel for almost everyone and are annoyed with almost everyone at the same time... somewhat like family!  Tissue warning, but some darned funny moments, too.",1521849600,,452,4.907894736842105
6683153,5,B00NWLNBBO,Great product arrived quickly,1521417600,,29,6.5
6683154,2,B00NWLNBBO,"It's a remake of Rocket Gibraltar, which too was less than stellar.  The acting was alright, though the husband and wife were unbearable as characters.  Billy Connolly was charming.  I wish I could have him voice my Garmin maps.

***SPOILER****

The daughter's speech at the end was contrived, and all the members had an instant conversion with no thought or reflection.  The climax was terribly nihilistic which in itself is a dismal philosophy.",1521072000,,446,5.041095890410959

6683158,2,B00NWLNBBO,"I'm in love with Rosamund Pike.  She just doesn't know it.  This movie didn't do much for me, I guess you have to be a British movie buff and I've not.  Long and drawn out with focus on divorce.",1512777600,,194,3.923076923076923
