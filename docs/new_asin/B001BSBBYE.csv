3498028,4,B001BSBBYE,"Purchased this DVD because I had the ""winter blues""  the sections on motocross and trials are super fun to watch. Only complaint? Music is loud and the sounds of the engines need to be higher. WOuld love to hear the bikes more and the music less. Other than that. Good flick for hte few bucks it cost.",1324598400,6,301,4.280701754385965
3498029,3,B001BSBBYE,"It's all interviews, no footage of riding at all, except by chance in the background once or twice: it's interviews from start to finish. The interviews are on-site at various competition venues -- hill climb, trials competition, hare and scramble, supermoto, etc. -- with both little-known people in the world of competition and well known or even legendary riders. Although the interviewer (off camera) generally poses fairly bland questions, many of the interviewees do quite well and are interesting and engaging. If the film were billed as ""all interviews,"" it *might* deserve another rating star, but because the cover art, cover text, and studio description will lead potential viewers to expect mostly action footage, it probably deserves one less star.",1312502400,4,761,5.35
3498060,1,B001BSBBYE,"This was without a doubt the most misleading bike movie I have ever seen. It read on the cover that the movie was about desert racing, hill climbs, motocross, etc and there was not one moment of racing in the whole movie. The ads were clearly written to mislead. The whole 1 hour and 21 minutes were of interviews with the bike riders of the hill climbs, desert racing, and motocross. I could hardly believe that I spent $2.99 for this piece of worthless info. I have been a long time dirt bike rider and again, from the ads, believed it would have been similar to ""ON ANY SUNDAY"". The kind of movie that dirt riders love to watch. Boy oh boy, I will certainly be careful of any other dirt bike movies sold by amazon.",1431216000,,717,4.279411764705882

3498067,1,B001BSBBYE,"Nothing but talking heads, and not particularly articulate ones. There is no riding. This seems like a deliberately misleading ripoff -- this movie should be removed from Amazon.",1398124800,3,178,5.392857142857143

3498080,1,B001BSBBYE,"There isn't even a single Dirt Bike in this movie.  It is a series of short interviews with poor audio.
Amazon has a completelty wrong description and I am going to ask for my money back.
Most of the time you can not even hear what the interviewers question is.",1371600000,,261,4.22

3498082,1,B001BSBBYE,"My kids wanted to get this movie.  So, I let them get it.  It was all interviews of different dirt bike riders.  But, what good is that if there is no riding?  People like to hear what really good riders have to say but mostly they want to see the action of the ride.",1359936000,3,267,3.888888888888889
3498083,3,B001BSBBYE,Good footage of different off-road disciplines. Nice way to open minds to some of the possibilities available to enjoy. Funnier than shoveling snow!,1357257600,,148,5.478260869565218
3498084,1,B001BSBBYE,Have watched & owned many motorcycle videos.  Thus I was expecting some live views of this amazing sport and there was ONLY interviews.  Very disappointing.,1356998400,,156,5.2

3498086,1,B001BSBBYE,This just plain sucks.  I wanted some riding.  It shows some riding on the cover.  Instead it should show the 50 different people who just drone on about how they like to ride.  Complete garbage.  I want my $ back.,1350518400,,214,4.25
3498087,4,B001BSBBYE,Good footage...and love the bonus stuff at the end....would have loved it to have been another 3 hours longer . thank you,1342656000,2,121,4.545454545454546
3498088,4,B001BSBBYE,"Keep in mind - this is a short video, and very well done. I loved watching the trials (climbing large rocks)and freestyle motocross. I am very disinterested in 'super-moto' (half asphault and half dirt). Photography is excellent!! I picked mine up in Walmart in the $5.00 bin - well worth it.

3498089,3,B001BSBBYE,"The main feature is only 37 minutes, enough to provide an overview of the various types of riding.  The filming and editing is very good and it does give you a good taste of each style, but I was left wanting more.  (Maybe that was the main idea - I'm pumped up to go ride now!  And I want a supermoto bike!  And a trials bike...)  I liked watching this video once, but I doubt I'll watch it again...",1334880000,,400,4.012658227848101

8284477,3,B001BSBBYE,"This DVD is OK, but there should be a lot more racing footage and showing of bike technology.  There are way too many interviews.  All in all, an average DVD, but lacking in many respects.  I would only purchase this one if you can it from a 'bargain bin'.",1456531200,,256,4.183673469387755
8284478,2,B001BSBBYE,"Dull as hell.  All interviews.  No riding footage.  Some good info in the interviews, but a poor film overall.",1452470400,,110,4.684210526315789
8284479,4,B001BSBBYE,"A pretty good video. I enjoyed it. I even own 2 copies of it so I can loan one out and still have a copy. I raced Desert, Enduro and Grand Prix when I was younger. Won more than my share, Then moved on to racing a car offroad. I still work as an official at races. This video reminds me a great deal of when I was racing a bike. There is LOTS of action footage in this video, contrary to what some of the reviewers claim. Don't pay attention to them. Some of them even lie about what is on the video. I cannot imagine why they would or what video they were watching. What is on the disc is what it is advertised as.",1449100800,,615,3.8503937007874014
