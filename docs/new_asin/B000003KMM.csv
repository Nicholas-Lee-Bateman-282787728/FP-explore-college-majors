1181449,4,B000003KMM,"I felt this was a beautiful film. Just the right amount of romance combined with side splitting comedy. This is one of the few times some of these actors (Wesley Snipes) have appeared in comedies and I laughed out  loud. Humor, Romance and a stand up and cheer ending, who could want more?",932515200,5,289,4.452830188679245
1181450,5,B000003KMM,If you need to pick with film of the three films to see.  Just stay with the first one.  Great cast and a good script.,930700800,,118,3.68

1181453,5,B000003KMM,A good Comedy/Romance and look into contemporary Baseball. The movie makes you laugh and brings you into the personalities of the individual team members as they struggle both individually and as a team to make something of themselves throughout the course of a season. The commentary by Bob Uecker  and sidekick brings an added dimension to the movie.,1510790400,,352,5.068965517241379
1181454,5,B000003KMM,"I have lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie and I still find myself leaning in with anticipation during the last game. I already know who is winning and how it will end; yet, it still pulls me in. That is a sign of a good movie. It stands the test of time and can still reel you in.",1510444800,,302,3.734375

1181456,5,B000003KMM,This is one of my top five or ten favorite movies of all time.  It's a film that I can watch over and over again and still love it.,1508544000,,131,3.5172413793103448

1181458,5,B000003KMM,"Given that I'm a baseball player at heart, I have a soft spot for movies like this (especially when it's a typical underdog story).  But what sets Major League apart is how the production and storyline will grip you by late in the movie.  Between the way that the season unfolds and the exciting way that they build up the start of their division-tiebreaker game, you actually feel the team taking the field that night.  Other baseball movies may be more pure and technically better written, but this one is the most enjoyable experience of them all.

Which is why, despite the terrible soundtrack (and the fact that Tom Berenger, the star, swings like a girl), it's still one of my favorite movies ever.  Maybe THE favorite.",1507852800,,725,4.677165354330708

1181463,3,B000003KMM,"This is a pretty good baseball comedy.  The owner of the Cleveland Indians dies and his wife takes over and wants to move the team someplace warmer.  So she tells her manager to try to put together a team of rag tag misfits so that they will lose so many games nobody will come to see them and give her an out to move the team.  Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen Corbin Bernsen Wesley Snipes and Dennis Haysbert are all great in this and so are Rene Russo and Margret Whitton.",1505260800,,470,4.2

1181511,5,B000003KMM,"I'll quote my friend Sky in saying that this is: ""The greatest movie of all time."" Starring Tom Berenger before his head grew to like twice it's original size and Charlie Sheen pre-AIDS and intravenous drug addiction (well I'm not quite sure about that last one, he may well have been addicted to heroin at the time of filming, I just assume that since he didn't look like a holocaust survivor in this movie that he wasn't), and also the great Dennis Haysbert, pre-Allstate and being elected president (in the show 24) I'm just messing around. I love this movie, from beginning to end it's hilarious, there are so many quotable lines in the movie, don't even get me started. I send my friends texts all the time with just a line from the movie where they're expected to know the next line, they always do because we've watched it at least 200 times.

1181659,4,B000003KMM,"I originally saw Major League in the theater when it was released back in 1989. I got this edition and rewatched it. It has aged well. It's still funny and inspiring.

Major League doesn't have the gritty ""real baseball"" feel of Bull Durham (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bull-Durham-Blu-ray/dp/B004TJ1H14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bull Durham Blu-ray</a>), but most of the actors do a credible job. One exception is a veteran pitcher (played by Chelcie Ross). If you played baseball even in Little League, you'll cringe at his pitching motion. But Charlie Sheen has a good motion from his days as a star high school player, Wesley Snipes looks good as an outfielder and base runner, and the others looked convincing enough as baseball players.

The storyline is improbable of course, but not outlandish. Just go with it. Renee Russo is stunning, and furnishes a good side story with Tom Berenger as the catcher.

If you've never seen this and like baseball, don't think twice - just get it. It's not quite as dramatic as seeing the Cubs win the World Series, but Cleveland fans might like watching this blast from the past to help forget their big Game 7 loss.",1479254400,2,1202,5.217616580310881

1181785,5,B000003KMM,"This is my favorite documentary, covering the early days of Moneyball before Corbin Bernsen changed his name to Eric Chavez.  Like most good documentaries, you learn new things.  I was completely unaware of Lew Wolff's original career as a Las Vegas showgirl, but if him and Donald Phelps found love, who am I to argue with it?  Margaret Whitton doesn't really strike me as a visual double for Wolff -- or Sandy Alderson, I believe that to save time, they compressed the Wolff and Alderson characters -- but if Jonah Hill can play Paul DePodesta...errr...Peter Brand, I guess it's reasonable.

[WARNING SPOILERS]

There's a big twist at the end when it turns out that Rick Vaughn was played by Charlie Sheen!  I did not see that coming.  Two and a Half Men was great, I hope they make a movie where they add another half-man and possibly a baby because that would be comedy legend.",1476576000,2,881,4.645161290322581

The female is badly written, hideously dressed and coiffed, badly cast, and you have to wonder why it was written.  Was it so that women could sit through a baseball movie?  Baseball is great.  Who couldn't enjoy the movie without this tripe.  Was the writer/director going for some kind of 'Sleepless In Seattle' mood thrown in for no reason.  The woman, by the way, would have been fired for allowing that nonsense in the library.  James Gammon.  Excellent.  Terrific film. Love Bob Uecker.

But these are guys with heart. They want to win. And when they discover that they have been maliciously set up, they decide to prove that the new owner is dead wrong.

There is not much to say really, it's just an awesome film. Some of the most amazing chemistry seen on the big screen. Great actors and a fine script written by oscar winning screenwriter David S. Ward. Also, the legendary ""Cleveland Indians"" character Rick ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn played by Charlie Sheen in one of his best and most memorable performances.

1181872,5,B000003KMM,"Well, of course, this is the classic baseball movie of all time! At least in my opinion. Utterly delightful, and of course, timeless. I, of course, love the lyrics of Randy Newman's immortal theme song, which go something like, Burn on big river, burn on, the Lord can make you overflow, but the Lord can't make you burn. When I was a child in Cleveland visiting the family, I remember Brown's Stadium, and cruising the mighty Cuyahoga on my uncle's boat. When the ""big river"" spontaneously combusted and caught fire years later from it's own thick greasy layers of pollution it was the wake up call to address environmental clean-up. David Ward made this film to perfection, and Charlie Sheen is brilliant, as is young Wesley Snipes. Highly recommended for nice clean fun!",1438646400,,773,4.819548872180451

Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Rene Russo, Wesley Snipes, James Gammon, Margaret Whitton and Most Notably Bob Uecker are in the cast.  There are also a few major league players from around that era that play small parts in the movie; like Pete Vuckovich, Willie Mueller and Steve Yeager.  This is a lighthearted, entertaining movie with a simple plot.  A former showgirl inherits the Cleveland Indians from her deceased husband, but wants to move the team to a warmer client.  Her intent is to get the attendance so low, that her contract will allow the team to be moved.  She then instructs her general manger to hire the worst team of misfits that would not be able to win a game. The team as expected struggles for a win with some very humorous results.  But the twist in the movie is when the team finds out about the owners plans and decides to go for a title win.",1435968000,4,979,4.528409090909091

However, this one is especially good.  Another confession -- I like to root for the underdog (unless, of course, when they are playing my favorite team), and the Cleveland Indians have earned the title of underdog's underdog.  The story proceeds with baseball as its backdrop, but the essence of the story is the aspirations and challenges that individual members of the team face during the season.  It is a story about the desire to win and thereby to establish one's self-worth.  I think that anyone watching this film will get caught up in the challenges that the players overcome and will find that very uplifting.",1405382400,,797,4.617021276595745

1182066,5,B000003KMM,Have watched this movie many times and it's funny each time. A must watch for all baseball fans. Bob Yeucker is hilarious as the announcer and the 'wild thing' is a familiar face. Enjoy!,1399766400,,186,4.5
1182067,4,B000003KMM,Still funny today as when I first watched it.  Heck my kids even find it funny.  Just a bit outside.,1399593600,,100,3.95
1182068,4,B000003KMM,"It's the kind of movie you can go back to from time to time and enjoy.  Charlie Sheen as ""The Wild Thing"" and Bob Uecker as the radio announcer (as he still is; listen if ever you have a chance) make the film worthwhile, but there are other colorful characters also involved.  You don't even have to like baseball a great deal to enjoy this upbeat comedy.",1399507200,,355,4.2835820895522385
1182069,4,B000003KMM,Love this movie! Classic. They filmed it at Milwaukee County Stadium rest it's poor soul. Charlie Sheen is always winning.,1399420800,,122,5.15
1182070,5,B000003KMM,"Great movie, streams nicely!!! Thanks again Amazon for your wonderful services. I just wish there were more selections to choose from.",1399420800,,134,5.428571428571429
1182071,4,B000003KMM,"If you like baseball you will enjoy this movie.  It has a lot of comedy in it, Tom Berenger is a catcher, and has seen better days. He isn't playing ball anymore.  The new owner of the ball team wants them to be dead last at the end of the season, so she can move the team to Miami.  She gets her manager to hire all the men that didn't make the grade in baseball or had injuries and had to be cut. Berenger is one of them. When these guys get together they wind up making a great ball team.  There is also an old flame of Berenger's in the film.  It's a hoot.  Charlie Sheen plays an awesome pitcher, only problem is, no one knows he can't see at a distance.  They get that problem solved with glasses.  He throw 100 mph fast balls. All the fans call him ""Wild Thing"" because of his pitching before he got the glasses. Good baseball movie.  The team they are supose to be playing is the  Cleveland Indians. This movie is not for children.",1399334400,,939,4.081967213114754
1182072,5,B000003KMM,Perhaps this is the only way that we will ever see the Indians make the World Series. Really this is a good baseball film. The actors are a good team and they put the story line over the wall. Excellent!,1399334400,,203,4.1
1182073,4,B000003KMM,"This movie is great fun. The language is a bit rough. I have seen it more than once, but it still makes me laugh.",1399248000,,113,3.75
1182074,4,B000003KMM,"There are only a few movies I would give 5 stars, so 4 stars for me means this is worth a watch.  I like baseball and my team wasn't playing that night so I was trolling for a movie.  Why not a baseball movie?  I thought I'd surely seen it, but I hadn't.  By the end, I stopped multi-tasking and watched with my undivided attention.  If you want a light movie, this is a good choice.",1399161600,,383,3.986842105263158

1182077,5,B000003KMM,Funny older baseball movie!  A lot of good characters in the movie to watch!  Good underdog movie to watch too!,1398816000,,111,4.5
1182078,5,B000003KMM,"This is a great baseball movie.  It's just realistic enough about baseball to be funny but not too realistic enough to be a buzzkill.  The acting wasn't great but adequate and the story line was just enough to keep the plot going without grinding to a halt.  To be honest I was a little impressed with the athleticism of both Charlie Sheen and Corbin Bernsen.  Good movie, worth a watch.

Only negative was the language and the overuse of the ""f@#$"" bomb.  Would have been great movie without it.

1182081,5,B000003KMM,If you've never seen it it may take a couple of times of watching it to fully experience the comedy. Uecker will make you cry laughing! It's good not so clean fun!,1398643200,,163,4.125

1182084,5,B000003KMM,"Major League is one-of-a-kind, perfect in every way possible, not comparable to anything before or after. Except ""Slap Shot."" Hilarious, raucous, featuring unforgettable cliche riddled characters buffed to a high gloss and presented mostly straight-faced ... there is almost no scene that lacks a line being quoted 20-years later. From ""Tribe Slump Hits 34-Years"" to (spoiler alert!) ""F*** you, Jobu. I do it myself!"" There is nothing about this movie that is less than adorable. If you don't enjoy this, consider a sense of humour transplant.",1398124800,,543,5.325581395348837
1182085,5,B000003KMM,Comedy and sports at its best can watch this over and over I love it .Part 2 is just as goid,1397952000,,92,3.4285714285714284
1182086,5,B000003KMM,"It is just one of those films that appeals to me. Loved the humour, loved the actors. Made an excellent ""opposite"" to watching Field of Dreams which was a much more serious movie which I have in my top 5 of favourite films. Great casting in Major League.",1397865600,,254,4.3125
1182087,5,B000003KMM,"Now, I have to admit I'm not the biggest fan of Charlie Sheen or Wesley Snipes. I am, however, a big fan of Tom Berenger, and I find that this is a pretty good flick. Major league is humorous and at the same time captures some of the vibe of major league baseball both for the fans, the players, and even the managers. It's one of those movies that (at least for me) I can watch over and over and not get tired of it; and to me, that's the hallmark of a classic movie.",1397692800,,468,3.9368421052631577
1182088,5,B000003KMM,"Great fun. I grew up 5 blocks from Ebbets Field and worshipped the Dodgers until they abandoned Brooklyn. Years later I went to every game I could at Fenway Park in the last days of Ted Williams when I was a student at Harvard Law School. A few reviewers complain that this isn't a REAL baseball movie. Well, no, of course not. It's not meant to be taken seriously. What it is meant to be, is fun, and it is that, with not a single unpleasant scene or character. The final scene - not to worry, I won't give it away - is just the kind of thing I loved to do when I coached softball teams in summer camps. I really wish they made more movies like this one. Enthusiastically recommended.",1397606400,,685,4.196969696969697
1182089,2,B000003KMM,Just okay.  Nothing special.  Wish Primetime had more sports movies to choose from. Movies are pretty slim pickings as far as we are concerned.,1397606400,,143,4.916666666666667
1182090,4,B000003KMM,Not a serious movie and not realistic about the way Major League Baseball works but that is probably why I works.,1397520000,,113,4.428571428571429
1182091,5,B000003KMM,"Just watching this movie for Bob Uecker playing the Indians announcer Harry Doyle would be reason enough, but the rest of it is great, too.",1397520000,,139,4.6
1182092,5,B000003KMM,This  is one of my favorite comedy movies to watch. The cast in this movie is excellent and entertaining and I love it when crowd does the wild thing among other things. I really do not think that you would be disappointed in it at all.,1397520000,,236,4.130434782608695
1182093,3,B000003KMM,"Although made 25 years ago (which would probably make it PG-13 today) it's still filled with bombs left and right. Great plot line and funny story, but too base for my teen.",1397433600,2,173,4.4375
1182094,5,B000003KMM,Not sure why you have 2 reviews for this I only have the one and I really love the show,1397433600,,87,3.4
1182095,5,B000003KMM,It is very realistic and fun to see players and managers up close on my computer. The movie makes you feel like you are at the game.,1397433600,,132,3.925925925925926
1182096,4,B000003KMM,Old movie but it was a great escape from reality.  We should give this back to the current Cleveland.  Maybe this is what they need in Chicago,1397433600,,142,4.222222222222222
1182097,5,B000003KMM,Always loved this movie actually I believe it's one of the reasons why I love baseball so much because of this movie.,1397260800,,117,4.363636363636363
1182098,4,B000003KMM,I love this movie.  Very funny.  My only problem is the bad language was excessive.  Need a pg version of this movie,1397260800,,116,4.181818181818182
1182099,3,B000003KMM,Some funny moments and great characters but feels a bit flat and dated. Worth watching but don't expect a classic.,1397174400,,114,4.75

1182102,5,B000003KMM,"Hilarious...top to bottom.  A must see for everyone, sports fans or not.  Starts with an early whiff of what sports used to be...lightly attended, not seemingly expensive and winding up in a huge major league ending.",1397088000,,216,4.972222222222222
1182103,5,B000003KMM,Our family has watched this movie many times and still enjoys it!  This is one movie you never get tired of seeing and it is a good Sunday evening movie for the whole family to watch.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys seeing the underdog come out on the winning side!!!  It is very enjoyable.,1396915200,,309,4.293103448275862
1182104,5,B000003KMM,"You can tell where the mind of the new owner of the Cleveland Indians is when she wants to move the team to Miami. To achieve this awesome task she threatens the players that unless they start winning ball games she will move the team. Then, in a deceptive way she fills the current roster of players with underdogs. These are guys who are has-been or never-will-be players without any real  talent or skill to play baseball. Thus the Cleveland Indians were doomed to fail.
However, miraculous as it may sound, Lou brown, the Indians manager, is bound and determine to produce a winning team no matter what the circumstances. In time the players do improve and surprise everybody.
Excitement, action, and lots of humor put the viewer right there in each players shoes on the playing field.
I like it especially when Rick Vaugh, the Cleveland pitcher, played by Charlie Sheen, discovers that he has poor eye sight and can't always see just where his flame-throwing fast ball is going. Can you imagine how a baseball player might feel coming up to the plate with this WILD THING pitching? It's dangerous to say the least.
But with glasses, the WILD THING establishes better control and the team goes on to win ball games even to the disappointment of the new owner. And I'm still laughing just thinking about this great comedy. Marvin P. Ferguson, author of BOYS ON THE GOLD COAST.",1396656000,,1379,4.698347107438017

1182107,5,B000003KMM,"This ranks as one of my all time favorite movies and is something I watch every year on Opening Day. As simple as the plot is, it never takes itself to seriously and one of the most quotable movies I have ever seen.  Each actor is perfectly cast and really lets you invest in the movie.  From beginning to end it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie and gives all of us long suffering fans of bad teams a ray of hope every year they play the first game of the season.  My two favorite characters are Bob Uecker as Harry Doyle and James Gammon as Lou Brown.",1396224000,,551,4.130841121495327

1182121,5,B000003KMM,"I've probably seen Major League 25 times and it never gets old. It's about the Cleveland Indians and the plot by the ex-showgirl owner to field a team so terrible that they'd finish dead last. That's the only way she can break the team's contract with the city and move it to Miami. Predictably, the squad of has-beens and never-weres does the unthinkable -- they win. But the story is not the main attraction -- it's the endearing characters and laugh-out-loud script. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Wesley Snipes head a perfect cast of baseball stereotypes, but Bob Eucker steals the show as play-by-play announcer Harry Doyle. As baseball movies go, this one's a Hall-of-Famer.",1394323200,,681,4.930434782608696

1182126,5,B000003KMM,This is one of my all time favorite movies and made somewhat better than Caddy Shack. Which is also one of my favorite movies. Major league is just funny and has really good sub plots with great acting. I liked it so much I bought a backup CD in case I ruin one of them. Major League II is also a great movie and funny. Major League III should be avoided.,1393977600,,355,4.014084507042254

1182137,4,B000003KMM,"This is a decent film for the baseball fan and 1980s nostalgia buff. The movie is very like-able and follows the standard tale of a group of underdogs who rise to the challenge. Throw in a little light romance, a tyrannical owner and a group of colorful baseball cliches and spins and you have a good sports comedy.  The movie is wrapped around the attempts by a tyrannical and greedy woman (Margaret Whitton) who inherits the Cleveland Indians from her late husband. She hates Cleveland and wants to ensure that her proposed sale to a Miami group of investors goes through while forcing the city to void her team's lease for failing to attract the minimum 800,000 fans. Her solution to assemble a bad team and an inexperienced manager seems sound to her but but there is the team of (catcher) Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger), (pitcher) Ricky 'Wild Thing' Vaughn (Charlie Sheen), third baseman) Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen), (outfielder) Willie Mays hayes (Wesley Snipes), (pitcher) Charlie Donovan (Charles Cyphers), (outfielder) Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Hybert) and manager (manager) Lou Brown (James Gammon) that comes to believe they can and will win in spite of her. Rounding the cast in very good roles are:  Bob Uecker as the wise-cracking announcer Harry Doyle; Rene Russo as Jake's long-suffering ex-girlfriend , Margaret Whitton as Rachel Phelps, and several former major leaguers (Pete Vukovich as Haywood, Steve Yeager as Duke Temple) playing opposing team players,  Kurt and Keith Uchima who play two wise-cracking Japanese groundskeepers and several uncredited actors playing Indians fans..

This kind of film is a throwback in many ways because it si not pretentious, not terribly offensive and fun. So, get a Chicago-style hot dog with mustard, a coke and wear your baseball cap and enjoy the antics and funny lines and bits. Play ball!",1392163200,,1843,5.072607260726072

I was expecting something with a weak plot that would redeem itself by providing some great belly laughs. Like Caddyshack or Stripes, for example, or even Strange Brew. But nope, the plot was certainly weak, but the laughs were more of an occasional snicker. Maybe if this movie had people like Murray and Candy and Dangerfield, it would have had more of a shot.

1182250,5,B000003KMM,"There have been a lot of baseball movies made over many decades.  Most are serious, but some are funny.  Major League (1989) is funny.  It's about the last place Cleveland Indians who can't seem to buy a win if they tried.  Fan attendance is terrible, the owner wants the team to lose so she can move the team to Miami, the players suck, and even the radio announcers are asleep at the wheel.  Does this team have any prayer at all?  Watch to find out.  This movie doesn't have just one memorable character.  Every single character is memorable, it seems.  The Indians themselves are a team full of characters.  The movie is a comedy, but it also has a lot of serious moments as well.  Just when you think a scene is going to play out completely serious, there's some comedy thrown in when you might not be expecting it.  This movie has humor, action, romance, everything.  The Indians games were actually filmed at County Stadium in Milwaukee.

The Natural (1984) is my favorite baseball movie, but Major League is a classic comedy that I highly recommend when you're in the mood for a baseball movie that's funny.",1366416000,,1115,4.565656565656566

1182266,5,B000003KMM,"This is a very fun, and entertaining movie, especially if you are a baseball fan. Several in the cast were unknowns at the time (1989) like Wesley Snipes, Rene Russo, and Dennis Haysbert. They used real ex-MLB players for members of opposing teams, and Charlie Sheen actually pitched in high school, so he looks natural on the mound, no body double needed.

The new owner wants the team to lose so she hires players no one wants due to age, can't hit, or can't throw, and a manager from the minors. There are crazy fans and an announcer (Bob Uecker) who spikes his own drink through the entire game. Somehow they make it work.

Outside of a funny cameo in Ferris Bueller, Mr. Sheen had done only dramatic acting.  His performance as Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughan showed he a great knack for comedy and he almost exclusive does that style of acting today.  The film focuses on the hapless Cleveland Indians who are inherited by a Las Vegas showgirl who wants to move the team to Miami (the film was released prior to baseball expanding to that city).  She orders the GM to assemble the worst team possible so they draw less than the required attendance to iniate an escape clause in the lease.  Of course through seemingly insurmountable odds, the team wins and forces a one game playoff for the division title versus the mighty New York Yankees.  Mr. Berenger & Mr. Sheen had recently worked together on Platoon and share a nice chemistry.  Bob Uecker adds some authentic MLB exposure as the team's announcer (most of the movie was actually shot in Milwaukee, Uecker's hometown).  All in all, Major League adds up to a fun way to spend two hours.",1347235200,,1231,4.719626168224299

As someone who lived in Cleveland from 1977-2000, the movie has special poignancy for me, especially the brilliant opening. The movie is ""just a bit outside"". It is a little too sentimental, silly and unfocused to match the best satires and a little too wacky, lewd and profane to equal the best romcoms or underdog dramas.

A key premise to the film is that a team of struggling baseball players has been hired to help contribute to the demise of the club (the Cleveland Indians); on the basis that their failure will allow the club to be relocated.

As a team of misfits they warm the heart as all-time underdogs, and this group of battlers and unique personalities are a humorous and entertaining lot. Their status as underdogs makes them inspiring, and you don't have to be a baseball person to enjoy the film.

BTW, just one point: when I was in about 4th/5th grade, years and years ago, and living in the Shaker Heights area of Cleveland, my older cousin would get free tickets to the Indians games from school for her straight A's.

This Blu-ray edition is a good transfer as well. The picture is crisp and shows no visual artifacts or defects at 1080p viewing. One thing that I really enjoyed on this disc was the alt. ending scenes and what the original storyline was for the owner of the Indians and how they envisioned her arc in to end up completely differently. For those who haven't seen it, the movie would have been the same up almost till the end where they revealed that she really did love the Indians, there in Cleveland and it was her plan all along to get those personal (whom she could afford) and that manager and get them to pull it together for a playoff run.

The finest films ever made CITIZEN KANE, CASABLANCA and GONE WITH THE WIND, do not have profanity, unless you consider the word DAMN.  I do not think it has damaged their appeal.

Executive summary: this movie ROCKS!

How can you not like a baseball movie that major league baseball players love? Watch the DVD extras to find out more about that aspect.

Charlie Sheen pitched in college and it showed in his pitching in this movie. James Gammon was spot-on as the gravelly-voiced field manager and is one of my favorites of the movie. Bob Uecker got to spread his wings and say all the wacky things he wishes he could say on his Brewers play-by-play broadcasts, coining some phrases that have woven their way into the fabric of American life over the years. ""JUUUUUST a bit outside, he tried the corner and missed"".

This version has the extra features that show what went into making the movie, how the actors got goose bumps when they took the field to a packed ballpark cheering for them, and all the other behind-the-scenes stuff that makes DVD extras worth watching.

This movie is a keeper. I still find myself laughing until I have tears running down my cheeks at some of Uecker's antics. This one will never get old!",1250985600,,1215,4.739336492890995
1182352,5,B000003KMM,"Major League is a simple movie with a premise you've seen from literally hundreds of sports movies.  A bunch of losers come together and stink, then through hard work and plucky leadership, they start to win.  This movie isn't Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, it is most comparable to Paul Newman's classic Slap Shot.

The thing that elevates Major League over the competion in the screwball sports movie category is the pure mastery of the script and performances by the cast.  Bob Uecker steals every scene as Harry Doyle, the alcoholic announcer and Wesley Snipes gives the best performance of his career as Willie Mayes Hayes.

The baseball is not terribly realistic, yet the movie actually captures the feeling of a city on the downturn with the unexpected heroes making a run for it.

From the opening scene of the movie, you know exactly how it will end, but the journey there leads to one of the funniest and most quotable sports movies of our time.

Even 20 years later this one holds up.",1246838400,,996,4.6571428571428575

1182355,4,B000003KMM,"Considered by many sports fans as ""the greatest baseball"" film that captures the excitement of America's past time, the 1989 sports comedy film ""Major League"" brought in over $50 million during its theatrical run.

The film which was written and directed by David S. Ward (writer for ""The Sting"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"")  was known for jumpstarting the careers of Wesley Snipes (""Blade"", ""U.S. Marshalls"", etc.), Dennis Haybert (""24', ""The Unit"", etc.) and Rene Russo (""Lethal Weapn 3 and 4', ""Get Shorty"", etc.) but also trying to capture the realism of underdogs sports teams and even Charlie Sheen (who was a former high school baseball pitcher), an actor throwing actual pitches.  And possibly breathing new life into the Cleveland Indians baseball team (which did very well during 1990's) and giving significance to the number #99 and also athletes utilizing the song ""Wild Thing"" as their theme song.

""Major League"" is the ultimate sports film featuring a group of underdogs not expected do accomplish anything but in the process, becoming a team that has a chance of making it to the playoffs.

""MAJOR LEAGUE"" is featured in 1080p High Definition.  And is actually a very clean and vibrant transfer thanks to the fact that the film was remastered several years ago.

For a film that is 20-years-old, you realize how beautiful the actual picture quality is as colors pop, blacks are well done and although evident, minimal specks of dirt.  Of course, as many films created back in the late 80's and mid 90's tend to have a softness to it, ""Major League"" also has that soft feel.  But the amount of sharpness and color vibrancy makes this release much, much better than the 2007 ""Wild Thing Edition"" DVD release.

As for audio quality, audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (also French and Spanish Mono).  The film is primarily a dialogue-driven film and only until you get to the last half hour of the film, where the stadium is finally packed with people and Vaughn getting his ""Wild Thing"" introduction, do you finally see the sound being kicked up a notch.

Audio is front channel heavy, with some subwoofer usage during X's ""Wild Thing"" theme (even more pronounced on the menu selection).  Rear surrounds featured a little stadium ambiance but nothing significant in terms of audio direction but overall, you hear things quite clearly.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The ""Major League: WILD THING EDITION"" Blu-ray Disc release comes with everything that was included on the 2007 DVD and all are in Standard Definition.  Included are:

  * Commentary: Commentary by Writer/Director David S. Ward and producer Chris Chesser - The commentary for ""Major League"" was quite interesting.  Especially how David S. Ward wanted to reshoot scenes, for example, Wesley Snipes final scene and by the time he was done, he was black and blue from sliding a lot.  Also, Ward and Chesser discussing the crowd scenes especially in the championship game, shooting long hours to the early morning (which Russo cried because she was forgetting her lines because it was so late) and how CG wasn't used at all, especially during Charlie Sheen's pitching and more.  Discussion of how the ending had to be reshot because it didn't test as well in front of the audience.  So ,they had to travel to London to have Margaret Whitton reshoot her scenes as Rachel Phelps.  Also, how both men were almost speechless because they were enjoying the film.  Overall, an informative and fun commentary.
  * My Kinda Team Making Major League - (23:10) Interviews with the Director, Producer and cast of ""Major League"".  How the film continues to stay strong and how David S. Ward is a true baseball fan and how he modeled certain characters from a combination of a few baseball players and working with LA Dodgers Steve Yeager who put the cast through a 2 week baseball boot camp and more.
  * A Major League Look at Major League - (14:27) Interview with several Cleveland Indians baseball players and staff who discuss similarities or differences from the characters of ""Major League"" and people who actually play in the big leagues.  Especially how one minor leaguer watches the film each day he is supposed to start pitching.
  * Bob Uecker: Just A Bit Outside - (12:43) A look at Bob Uecker the baseball player, the baseball announcer and being on the film.  Featuring cast of ""Major League"", Cleveland Indians players and staff and interviews with Bob Uecker.
  * Alternate Ending with Filmmaker Introduction - (4:18) In the original screenplay and for the film, it was supposed to be revealed that the owner Rachel Phelps planned it all along and that she had to use the baseball players that they had because the team had no money.  But because it was tested badly among fans who despised her character, they had to reshoot the whole scene with her character.
  * A Tour of Cerrano's Locker - (1:35) A short segment with the character of Pedro Cerrano showcasing his vodoo shrine in his locker.
  * Photo Gallery - Still photos from the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Major League"" still manages to have the enthusiasm as it did back in 1989 with sports fans in 2009.  Many baseball players and even athletes talk about the film and how it ranks as one of their top sports films of all time and whenever its on television, they have to watch it.

It's an enjoyable film but it all comes down to what your preference is for a baseball film.  Are you looking for inspirational and serious films such as ""Field of Dreams"" or do you want a sports comedy film such as ""Major League"".  It's also an honest film that even professional baseball players and staff have said it has its relevance because many elements from the film actually happen in real life.  From veterans assisting rookies, players having their daily rituals before a game, relievers in their own element and the feeling of sadness and excitement for a fan of one's baseball team.

Obviously, not all audiences enjoy sports films but for those who do, ""Major League"" definitely is quite fun and entertaining with its team of interesting to unusual characters but most of all, watching a group of people rising to the occasion as a team and most of all kicking some butt!

""Major League: WILD THING EDITION"" is worth checking out!",1242691200,59,6363,4.839037927844588
1182356,4,B000003KMM,"Major League is one of my all time favorite movies with most of the lines of dialogue committed to memory long ago (after the 40th or 50th viewing...)  From the first time I saw the film I fell in love with the lovable losers that are destined to win one for all of the picked on losers out there.  At the time the film was released the Cleveland Indians had been known as one of the sorriest franchises in all of major league baseball.  Season after season the Indians found ways to miss out on being truly competitive.  As if by magic when the film was released the Indians seemed to turn things around in the seasons that followed finally becoming perennial contenders in the 90's.

The film itself is comedic gold. Full of cliches and silly jock humor, but also full of touching events that let the viewer care about the athletes they are watching on the screen.  We pull for the players and want to see them do well because the film allows us to sympathize with these losers and hope they can become winners.

Paramount released the Wild Thing Edition of this film to DVD a few years ago.  I grabbed that copy when it was available since it promised the alternate ending that most of us never knew about.  Having watched that ending you realize that without redoing a lot of the later half of the film that the film just wouldn't work with that ending and that what we got in the theatrical release was absolutely the way to go.  That same alternate ending and the rest of the extras that were included on the DVD have been included on the Blu-ray edition of the film, though those extras remain in standard definition, matted (black bars around all edges).  It would have been nice to see the extras upgraded to high defintion for the Blu-ray release, but in reality the important thing here is the film and it looks pretty darned nice.  Not perfect, but very nice.

The audio in the Blu-ray is fine though some would complain that it hasn't been upgraded beyond Dolby 5.1.  Considering what the film had when it was released, I'm happy to have a sound track that holds to the original.  As long as the dialogue comes through clearly as I'm quoting it back to the screen, I'm plenty happy with what I got. ;-)

Recommended for baseball fans and lovers of comedy.  Well worth the purchase for me, now having double dipped to own a copy on both Blu-ray and DVD.  One of my relatives or friends will soon be inheriting that DVD copy as I treasure the Blu-ray that Amazon was so quick to ship out to me.",1242086400,8,2505,4.396963123644252

1182358,5,B000003KMM,"From the writer of ""The Sting"" and its atrocious sequel comes a story of the most ragtag people ever to assemble on a baseball diamond. Charlie (as in Sheen) & Tom Berenger star in ""Major League."" Co-starring Dennis Haysbert, Corbin Bernsen, deliciously villainous Margaret Whitton, real-life baseball announcer Bob Uecker and featuring future stars Rene Russo & Wesley Snipes in their feature film debuts, this movie is a HOME RUN. Combining sharp dialogue with the antics & fun of baseball, this movie is a classic. Rated R, but should've been PG-13 (hey, the language is tamer than an episode of ""The Sopranos""; no offense to Tony). There's also an alternate ending, with optional commentary. Classic f---ing fun.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the sequel, which was made in 1994. Though the main cast reunites, Wesley Snipes is missing and has been replaced by Omar Epps as Willie Mays Hays, for whatever reason. Plus, Rene Russo appears in a wasted cameo, when she had more scenes in the first movie. I read somewhere that the director (David S. Ward, who wrote both movies) was embarassed by the language in the first movie, so he toned the sequel down for a PG rating, and this idiotic decision is noticeable, particularly in a scene where a catcher says, ""Goldarn it to heck."" Stupid writer & director. Not only is that how baseball players talk (in the 1st movie), but it's also part of what made the first movie so enjoyable. Randy Quaid is enjoyable, but not good enough to save what was toned down to a PG rated movie. I've gotta give ""Major League II"" 2/1/2 stars.",1240617600,,1590,4.760869565217392
1182359,5,B000003KMM,"Not much more needs to be said about Major League. It's one of the best baseball movies ever with very memorable characters and funny lines. The story is familiar by now, a group of cast offs and misfits are brought together by an owner betting they'll be so bad that she can move the franchise out of Cleveland to sunny Florida. Things start out bad but soon turn as they come together gradually over an exciting season to take the pennant from the defending champion Yankees.

1182361,5,B000003KMM,"This review is for ""Major League: The Turf Edition""
A TRUE COLLECTOR'S PRIZE EDITION!!!

Amazon has changed its listings for the various editions of ""Major League,"" and I cannot say with any certainty that if you order this edition, ASIN: B000MGBTQ6, that you will actually receive the ""Turf Edition.""  My recommendation is to contact the seller before buying.  So, if you order and get the ""Turf"" edition: lucky you!

Having failed (I ordered and re-ordered it three times I believe) to get the ""Turf Edition"" when Amazon had it listed under a different code, I wrote my very first review entitled, ""WARNING!!!! THIS VERSION IS NOT THE ONE YOU GET.""  Sometime over the last six months or so, Amazon finally de-listed ""Major League: Turf Edition,"" and added my review to the reviews posted for all the various versions of ""Major League"" except for this one.  The picture, as of October 25, 2008, shows the ""Turf Edition,"" so I am writing another review for this version; although my comments are strictly for the ""Turf Edition"" as pictured.

I managed to locate a copy of ""Major League: Turf Edition"" through another source a few months after I wrote my review (which I have since edited as well).  The short story about this edition is that it is strictly a ""collector's version.""  The only difference between the ""Turf Edition"" and ""Major League (Wild Thing Edition)"" is that this edition comes with an artificial sod covering on a slip case that goes over the box with the ""Wild Thing Edition"" DVD.  As a true fan of the movie and the Cleveland Indians, ""Major League: Turf Edition"" is the ultimate display version of the movie.  I keep my copy in an air tight bag, neatly displayed with other baseball memorabilia.

For those not familiar with the film, here is a summary of ""Major League (Wild Thing Edition), which I also own and have revised my review on:

A Cleveland fan since 1959, the thrill of ""what if"" was great--and I own a copy of every version that I am aware exists.  But, this movie--no matter what version you purchase--is an outstanding show.  The performances by all of the actors show a sincere desire to make a great movie.  In particular Dennis Haysbert (perhaps best known for his role as President David Palmer on 24) as Pedro Cerrano is awesome, while Charlie Sheen gives his best comedic performance.  Wesley Snipes as Willie Mays Hayes, not quite as well known at the time, engrossingly demonstrates his ability to do comedy--he really needs to do more comedy.

The baseball scenes are all believable and well shot; although more cameos by real players would have been even nicer.  Having been to many games, I think that the movie does a very good job of portraying what is is like to attend a professional baseball game.  Indeed, with Bob Uecker, I almost thought I was listening to a live game.  If you like baseball, Major League is one of the best--for entertainment, not drama--and I highly recommend it.

Bonus features for ""Major League (Wild Thing Edition)"" include: 1) commentary by writer/director David Ward and producer Chris Chesser; 2) My Kinda Team; 3) Major League: A Look at ""Major League""; 4) Bob Uecker: Just A Bit Outside; 5) An Alternate Ending with Filmmaker Introduction; 6) A Tour of Cerrano's Locker; and 7) a photo gallery.  How many of these bonus features are on the other editions, I cannot say; although I would hope that these and more are on the two disk edition (ASIN: B0019GO5AU).

If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.  Thanks.",1224892800,2,3775,4.732415902140673

1182364,5,B000003KMM,"I love this movie, I really do. MAJOR LEAGUE, to me, hasn't lost an iota of its watchability factor. The uproarious humor, sometimes verrrry salty, still cracks me up. The underdog theme still gets me cheering wildly. Its unexpected moments of poignancy, still heartfelt. The big game at the end, still ridiculously stirring. In terms of its place in my personal hierarchy of baseball flicks, this one ranks right up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Natural-Director-s-Cut/dp/B000MNOX94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Natural (Director's Cut)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bull-Durham-20th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0010YSD8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bull Durham (20th Anniversary Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pride-of-the-Yankees-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0010YSD9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pride of the Yankees (Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-League-of-Their-Own-Special-Edition/dp/B0001GF2CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A League of Their Own (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Field-of-Dreams-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Anniversary-Edition/dp/078322611X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Field of Dreams (Widescreen Two-Disc Anniversary Edition)</a>. Add in a low key but engaging romance, and MAJOR LEAGUE then boasts all the ingredients to be a pretty darn generous picture - if you're looking for laughs and love and baseball.

So the plot, in brief, centers around the hapless Cleveland Indians, who haven't won the pennant in over 30 years. This season, the team is intentionally jampacked with a ragtag bunch of losers and headcases and newbies. The film tracks an unlikely season in Cleveland's history, as somehow the Indians climb out of the cellar and ultimately vie for the pennant. This, despite the duplicity of the newly widowed, ex-showgirl team owner, who schemes to relocate her team to Miami. She's not a nice lady.

Absolutely, it's a predictable story, and the feel-good ending not much of a shock. But, man, just the sheer entertainment value oozing from this film! Factor in the excellent script, and take into account the really terrific cast. Starting with Tom Berenger, who keeps everything grounded with his broken-down character, who longs for one more day in the sun and who manages to keep his unruly crew together. Trickle down to Charlie Sheen's deadpanned juvenile delinquent pitcher (I think this was his first major comedic role), James Gammon's maverick, raspy-voiced manager, and Margaret Whitton's devilishly wicked (and sexy) Cleveland Indians owner. Rene Russo makes her debut here, after being a highly sought after supermodel. And, while she doesn't have too many scenes, she proves to be very memorable. Wesley Snipes (startlingly hilarious) and Dennis Haysbert were little known back then, and it's hard to recognize them as, respectively, the speedy showboat Willie Mays Hayes and the bald, voodoo-worshipping Pedro Cerrano. And then there's Bob Uecker, who is simply classic as the boozing Cleveland Indians broadcaster Harry Doyle. And how many of his lines can you quote? Does ""JUST a bit outside!"" ring a bell? Enough ESPN anchorfolks have used it...

MAJOR LEAGUE, coming out in 1989, does a great job of capturing the essence of life in the big leagues and depicting behind-the-scenes stuff in the clubhouse, and that rough-and-tumble camaredie which bonds a team together. No, it's not as perceptive or wise as, say, BULL DURHAM, but it has its moments. Not much in the way of soul-searching here, no. Instead, MAJOR LEAGUE has a simpler mission, which is to make you snort with laughter (although BULL DURHAM also does this effectively). The soundtrack rocks, by the way. Randy Newman's ""Burn On"" nicely opens the movie and is an ode to a long-suffering city of Cleveland. Then there's that one great slow song (don't know the name or singer) which seranades Jake and Lynn up to her loft apartment. And X's ""Wild Thing"" provides the chills up your spine as Rick Vaughn at last comes to the mound for his big showdown with Yankees power hitter Clue Haywood. In fact, MAJOR LEAGUE has been instrumental in introducing the trend of closers entering the field to some dramatic music.

So this dvd is the Wild Thing Edition and contains a pretty nifty set of bonus features, most of which are worth checking out: an informative audio commentary by the producer and the writer/director; ""My Kinda Team"" - the 23-minute-long Making Of segment (where, sadly, you can see how much Berenger has let himself go); A Major League Look At MAJOR LEAGUE - members of the real Cleveland Indians team talk about the film; Bob Uecker: Just A Bit Outside - a spotlight on Bob Uecker; an alternate ending with an introduction by the film producer - this scene purports that the owner Rachel Phelps actually had the team's best interests at heart; A Tour of Cerrano's Locker (dull); and a long-winded photo gallery.

Let's see, off the top of my head: the Wild Thing's birth control glasses; Jobu the voodoo god (created for this movie); duct-taping the plane; ""Hats for bats.""; ""How's your wife and my kids""; and, of course, ""JUST a bit outside!"" Just some of the stuff which cracked me up so much (and still do). And that's not even mentioning the riveting final game. Anyway, MAJOR LEAGUE proved to be popular enough to spawn two sequels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Major-League-2/dp/B00004RF87/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Major League 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Major-League-3-Back-to-the-Minors/dp/B00004RF84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Major League 3: Back to the Minors</a>. The first sequel is pretty good, the other one is a tosser.

Underdog films just don't get old. And if it's a sports underdog story, then all the better. MAJOR LEAGUE is raucous and off-the-wall and goofy and funny as hell. Ultimately, it's a feel-good movie that hits all the right notes. The characters are earthy and winning, for a bunch of sad sacks. Since this movie came out, the Cleveland Indians have fared much better in real life, even getting to the World Series in 1995 and 1997. Not bad for reality.

No Extra Features were found or listed. THIS IS THE MOST RECENTLY RELEASED VERSION.

UPDATE--OCTOBER 25, 2008:  In looking over my reviews, I found that Amazon has apparently created a new listing (ASIN: B000MGBTQ6) for ""Major League: The Turf Edition"" (if one can go by the picture), eliminated the listing that this review was originally written for, and lumped it in with the reviews for all the other editions--an action Amazon.com tell me ""helps"" buyers to be aware of all the editions available, even if the review doesn't specify which edition it is for.  Please see my review of item&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MAJOR-LEAGUE-WILD-THING-EDITION-WS-DUB-SPEC-MAJOR-LEAGUE-WILD-THING-EDITION-WS-DUB-SPEC/dp/B000MGBTQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MAJOR LEAGUE: WILD THING EDITION / (WS DUB SPEC) - MAJOR LEAGUE: WILD THING EDITION / (WS DUB SPEC)</a>&nbsp;to learn about the ""Turf Edition.""

As such, then, this review is now relevant to ""Major League (Wild Thing Edition)"" ASIN: B000M343BM, which is the edition Amazon kept sending me when I ordered ""Major League: The Turf Edition.""  While this review is also posted under ""Major League: I Love The 80s"" (ASIN: B0019GO5AU), a two disk special edition, clearly my comment cannot be relevant, as I do not own that edition, all be it the movie is the same movie.  As to how this edition differs from ""Major League"" (ASIN: B00006F7IM), I cannot say, as I do not own that edition either--although this and all other reviews are listed for all these editions.

Now for my opinion:  Needless to say, as a Cleveland fan since 1959, the thrill of ""what if"" was great--and I own a copy of every version that I am aware exists.  But, this movie--no matter what version you purchase--is an outstanding show.  The performances by all of the actors show a sincere desire to make a great movie.  In particular Dennis Haysbert (perhaps best known for his role as President David Palmer on 24) as Pedro Cerrano is awesome, while Charlie Sheen gives his best comedic performance.  Wesley Snipes as Willie Mays Hayes, not quite as well known at the time, engrossingly demonstrates his ability to do comedy--he really needs to do more comedy.

The baseball scenes are all believable and well shot; although more cameos by real players would have been even nicer.  Having been to many games, I think that the movie does a very good job of portraying what is is like to attend a professional baseball game.  Indeed, with Bob Uecker, I almost thought I was listening to a live game.  If you like baseball, Major League is one of the best--for entertainment, not drama--and I highly recommend it.

While I am no expert on judging true widescreen versions from ""matted"" widescreen presentations, the item description states the aspect ratio is 2.35:1; the description on the back of the box for ""Major League (Wild Thing Edition)"" states: ""This Film Is Presented In ""Widescreen"" Format.  The Black Bars On The Top And Bottom Are Normal.""  It also states: ""Widescreen Version Enhanced for 16:9 TVs.""  (If the other versions are different, I cannot say.)

Bonus features for ""Major League (Wild Thing Edition)"" include: 1) commentary by writer/director David Ward and producer Chris Chesser; 2) My Kinda Team; 3) Major League: A Look at ""Major League""; 4) Bob Uecker: Just A Bit Outside; 5) An Alternate Ending with Filmmaker Introduction; 6) A Tour of Cerrano's Locker; and 7) a photo gallery.  How many of these bonus features are on the other editions, I cannot say; although I would hope that these and more are on the two disk edition (ASIN: B0019GO5AU).

As a realist--knowing that the language,etc. that led to the ""R"" rating is all around and often needed to make the movie as realistic as possible--I ignored the rating and started watching this movie with my sons (on VHS) when the youngest was only six (now sixteen).  Major League remains one of their all time favorites, and we have watched it together several dozen times.  In my opinion, children get the excitement of baseball and ignore the other ""adult themes"" found in Major League.  Major League is a movie to watch with both family and friends, as it enhances the ""being there"" feel that the film provides.

1182383,5,B000003KMM,"Bollywood loves to churn out action films, but the Indians could learn some lessons from the Jewish-American cartel in Hollywood concerning story construction from this classic sport melodrama presented in the traditional three act format - three 40-minute blocks to produce a 2-hour movie.  Much is done brilliantly in the construction of the film and its story.  In the opening scene, the antagonist is introduced and hooks the viewer when she reveals the premise and plot - a rotten season where attendance falls below 800,000 for the year will allow her to escape her lease with the city and relocate her recently inherited Cleveland Indians baseball team to Miami, so she's invited has-beens and screwballs to training camp with the aim of composing a team that stinks enough to cause attendance to drop.

The remainder of the scenes in the first act introduce the protagonist (the catcher played by Tom Beringer) and all the main characters: Team Coach, Born-Again Pitcher, Voodoo Man, Pretty Boy, Willy Mays Hayes, and Wild Thing.  Nice subplots and tensions are introduced between these unforgettable characters, after which the main subplot is presented between the catcher and his ex-fiancee.  All of these characters have no idea that the team's new owner expects them to stink - they're all playing and coaching with determination.  But Act One ends with them playing their first game and losing 9-0.

Act Two opens with a scene in the office where the owner is complaining to the General Manager that the team is bad, but it doesn't stink.  And she complains that there is even some improvement.  So she increases the complications for the characters by taking away their perks and making them fly in a propeller plane rather than a jet.  While they continue to lose , subplots and tensions continue between the characters.  However, they also continue to show improvement especially when Coach notices that Wild Thing's pitching would improve if he wore glasses.  The owner responds with more complications - their propeller plane is replaced by a bus.  By the end of Act Two, their record is 60 wins and 61 losses.  That's when the plot is given its turning point - Coach finds out that none of them will have a job in baseball after the season ends because they were hired to lose.  After Coach shares this with the players, the catcher says there is only one option available to them - win the whole darn thing (as winners, they could work for another team next season).  The players will need 32 victories to stay in baseball after this season.

Act Three begins 31 victories later when they have to play the Yankees for the championship, who they've struggled against all season.  This act is 41 minutes of inning-by-inning action, conflict, and suspense.  In melodramatic fashion, they win! It's an awesome climax to a succession of dramatic suspense scenes. And in Hollywood subplot fashion, the catcher gets his girl.",1164412800,7,2939,4.924949290060852

1182388,5,B000003KMM,"Tom Berenger, Corbin Bernsen, Charlie Sheen, and Wesley Snipes star in this fun film about the woeful Cleveland Indians baseball team and how a group of misfits and castoffs came together to make the Indians pennant winners again.

Berenger stars as Jake Taylor, a former all-star catcher who has been toiling in the Mexican league.  He gets a call from the Indians GM to come to spring training to be the team captain and help mentor the younger players.  These players include Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes), a speedy outfielder who can only hit pop flys, Rick Vaughn (Charlie Sheen), a flame-throwing pitcher fresh out of the California penal league who possesses a blazing fastball but has no control, and Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert), a hard-hitting Cuban who defected for religious freedom.  He can crush fastballs, but nothing else.  He also has a shrine in his locker with an idol named Jobu. Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) is a high-priced third baseman who cares more about his investment portfolio than he does about baseball.

Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitten) has inherited the Indians after the death of her owner-husband.  A former showgirl, she is determined to move the team to Miami, where she will cash in on several perks from the city.  But to do this, the team's attendance must fall below a certain level.  Determined to get what she wants, she begins taking things away from the team, such as whirlpools, and even their private plane.  Soon the team is travelling to games by bus.  However, the team has Lou Brown (James Gammon) as their manager.  He is determined to make the Indians winners, regardless of what Rachel does.

The season starts off slowly for the team, and they are in their traditional last place position.  But the GM lets Lou in on Rachel's scheme, and things begin to change.  The players realize that the only option they have other than becoming free agents or being released is to win it all.  And that's what they set out to do.

I'm a big baseball movie fan, and this movie is one of my all-time favorites.  The story is excellent (being a Cubs fan, I'm glad the producers didn't pick them as their team to use), and the acting is tremendous. The choice of Bob Uecker as Indians announcer Harry Doyle was a stroke of genius.  His announcing and one-liners really add a great dimension to the film.  Rene Russo does a good job as Jake's on again, off again girlfriend Lynn Wells.  Its fun to watch their ups and downs throughout the movie.  There's even a take-off on the then-popular ""do you know us?"" American Express Card commercials.

I give this teriffic movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how a bunch of no-names and has-beens bond together for one magical season to become winners.",1136073600,15,2752,4.757383966244726
1182389,4,B000003KMM,"The Cleveland Indians haven't been doing very well for years. When the owner of the team dies, and leaves the team to his wife she decides that she wants to move the team to Florida. However she can only move the team to Florida if they continue to do poorly. So she sets out to put together a team of misfits, that she hopes will come in dead last in the baseball season.

 So you've got Tom Berenger's character who had been playing in the Mexican league and has bad knees, Corbin Bernsen as the pretty boy rich guy who won't take dives for the ball. Ex-con Rick ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn the man with the fast pitch who can't control the ball. There's also Willie Mays Hayes, he can run like the wind, and steal the bases, but he can't hit the ball.

1182393,5,B000003KMM,"If you want to have some fun ... along the lines of watching the Miracle Mets win it all in 1969 ... this is a movie for you.

""Major League"" is David Ward's baby.  He wrote the story.  He wrote the script.  He even directed it.  It's a story about the Cleveland Indians ... a collection of cast-offs and misfits ... who defy the experts (and their own team owner) and find the winning formula.

The script is very excellent.  There are more than a few gems (really memorable or funny lines) but it is all a very believable dialog.  Even the swear words (and there are quite a few of those here as well) are perfectly apt.

The casting is top-notch ... with selecting James Gammon to be the manager Lou Brown perhaps being the best hire.

The acting is superior, thoroughly superior, to most movies.  We tend to discount the quality of the acting when it is in a comedy, but, for this movie, we shouldn't.  Even the smaller roles are filled out with pretty good performances.

Tom Berenger as Jake Taylor ... the washed up ball player who gets one more taste of stardom ... is superb.  We like Jake, we trust him, and we want him to win.  He's been a carouser, but we know he's better than that, and will, given this new chance, make good.  That is Tom Berenger doing a good acting job.  Rene Russo as Lynn Wells (Jake's love interest) does a nice job of walking the line between her logic and her heart.  Here she is caring and vulnerable ... wise but, at the same time, unwise.  In short, she is lovable.  Corbin Bernsen plays the overpaid ballplayer Roger Dorn, and he doesn't really make the part work.  Dorn is supposed to be a prima donna, and he (Corbin) does all right with that part of it, but he never really comes across ... convincingly ... as a baseball player.  He tries, but can't quite pull it off.  Charlie Sheen as Rick Vaughn is my pick for the MVP (most valuable performer) of this movie.  Vaughn is a punk ... ""Wild Thing"" ... a pitcher with an attitude problem (and a 97 mph fastball) ... and a fan favorite.  Charlie doesn't have a lot of lines here, but he makes them count ... just a very excellent job of acting, I think.  Margaret Whitton plays Rachel Phelps ... the mean lady team owner ... and she is ... wonderful.  She has to lose all of her dignity to make the part work ... and she does.  She spews hated and venom ... all within the framework of a comedy ... and is miserable (and delighfully so) when the team manages to win.  Just a great job ... and a deft touch ... at comedic acting.  Wesley Snipes plays Willie Mays Hayes, the speedster lead-off man.  You can tell he (Wesley) tried hard to make the character believable ... and he succeeded.  James Gammon as Lou Brown, the team's manager, is perfect for the part.  His deadpan ""I've seen it all"" delivery is very much like the real life, over-seasoned, veteran baseball skipper he portrays.  Bob Uecker as the announcer Harry Doyle keeps things moving with his witty and baseball-savvy commentary.  And Chelcie Ross, who plays the aging pitcher Eddie Harris, gives a quite true-to-life portrayal, I felt.

The story moves along at a nice pace, and there is comedy in pretty much every scene.  The crowd scenes in the stadium (near the end of the picture) are incredible.  They must have done the filming at a real Indians game.  And the ""Wild Thing"" song scene ... when Charlie Sheen's character walks in from the bull pen ... is absolutely great.  Just an extremely fun moment for us movie watchers to enjoy.

Complaints?  Yep.  Two.  The Cerrano character.  He is a surly voodoo practicing defector from Cuba, and his surliness and voodoo are catered to in the movie.  Also, we are force-fed high society and higher learning.  OK.  Here's what happens:  Jake (the Tom Berenger character) takes Willie and Rick (Wesley Snipes and Charlie Sheen) to an expensive French restaurant, where the menu is even in French.  Right.  While there, he (Jake) spots his old flame (Rene Russo as Lynn Wells) and they re-connect.  She is now into literature big-time, and she's also engaged to marry an incredibly rich attorney.  She (later) chastises Jake for not having read at least some of the classics, and he, Jake, gives in and reads ""Moby Dick"".  Right.  This sort of scenario happens to a big league baseball player all the time.  Why not just let Lynn be a regular gal ... someone who is trying to forge a decent life for herself ... when she falls (again) for the charming big leaguer?

Still, the romance between Tom Berenger and Rene Russo works quite nicely.  They make a good on-screen couple ... and there's one song on the soundtrack that adds to the romantic atmosphere ... and when Lynn decides to dump the rich lawyer and go back with Jake (Well, I guess it could happen) ... and the team wins the big game ... it all makes for a very happy ending ... one that gives a substantial tug on your heartstrings.",1117497600,,4903,4.463359639233371

1182395,5,B000003KMM,"It is not nearly as well written or deep in character as Bull Durham, but for sheer fun, Major League may actually be better.  All the players are entertaining but the two who really sell the film are James Gammon as the manager, Lou Brown.  The scene that truly epitomizes Lou's character is when he is first called by the Indian's personnel director.  Lou is at his car repair shop and is offered the dream job of managing a major league team.  He ponders and says, ""I dunno, Charlie.  I gotta rotate a set of tires.""  The other show-stealer in the film is absolutely Bob Eucker as the play-by-play announcer who manages to deliver with straight-faced sincerity lines like, ""In case you haven't noticed and judging by attendance you haven't, the Indians are threatening to climb out of the cellar!""  It is predictable and sometimes cliche as all get out, but you WILL laugh at this film, make no mistake.",1113955200,,906,4.625
1182396,5,B000003KMM,"Featuring a motley band of eccentric baseball teammates, Major League ranks as one of the best sports comedies ever produced. Released in 1989, it covers the story of the hapless Cleveland Indians (winners of numerous division titles in the decade since) who are inherited by the dead owner's self-centered, bitchy wife, Rachel Phelps. Locating a clause in the team's contract with the city that will allow her to move the team to Miami if attendance falls below two million for the year, she decides to do everything in her power to make the Indians not just losers, but the worst team in history. The result is a memorable excursion in baseball playoff history...

Hiring ex-Toledo Mud Hens manager, turned tire-shop manager, Lou Brown (James Gammon) as the new manager of the Indians, Rachel Phelps begins to construct a team destined to lose - thus sending her to the far more preferable climate-friendly Miami. Bringing in a string of others misfits including Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes), a lightning bolt speedster who can't hit, Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger), an aging catcher with bad knees, Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) a high-priced, low-talent free-agent acquisition, Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert), a power-hitter who can't hit a curveball to save his life, and Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn (Charlie Sheen), a fireball pitcher who can't hit the broad side of a barn - a pathetic display of baseball futility quickly ensues.

Longtime Indians announcer Harry Doyle (Bob Uecker) provides a plethora of hilarious one-liners and perfect comic relief as he (whiskey in hand) follows the beginning of a magical season for Cleveland's lovable losers. Off-the-field stories also crop up with Jake's pursuit of his old flame Lynn Wells (Rene Russo), and Ricky Vaughn's affair with rival teammate Roger Dorn's wife Suzanne (Stacy Carroll).

In the end, only one thing on earth can motivate and mold this ragtag crowd of rejects into a playoff contender - their mutual dislike of Rachel Phelps. Downgrading Indian facilities as punishment for each win, she eventually has them flying to games in antique bi-planes and traveling cross-country by bus. Amazingly well-written, Major League is a comedy classic that truly delivers. Love of baseball is a plus, but not necessary for one to enjoy this movie. Funny is funny, and laughter is laughter. They extend beyond the boundaries of sports.

1182397,4,B000003KMM,"I am a big fan of the Major League series, was somewhat disappointed in Major League II, and was very pleasantly surprised by Major League III.

Here we get a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes, which holds up well with time and repeated viewings. The message is the importance of teamwork and the gelling of a team from some very quirky individuals. It's all offbeat and fresh and very uplifting feel good results.

In general that's true of the others in the series, especially Major League III, with which I was very pleasantly surprised - see those listings for more reviews.

Get all 3 and enjoy!",1097280000,,612,4.648148148148148
1182398,5,B000003KMM,"If you are like myself, you are just about sick of sports movies in which the sports action takes a backseat to some smarmy romantic subplot or otherwise irrelevant study in character development.  Okay, that worked in Bull Durham, but for the most part I question why movies like ""For the Love of the Game"" and ""Summer Catch"" even have to involve baseball or ball players.  Maybe it's just a trick to sucker people into thinking that they're going to see a sports movie.

Major League is impressive on three levels.  First, the actors are brilliant (even those relegated to smaller roles).  Second, the plot is mainly baseball action, baseball action and more baseball action.  Third, it's hilarious and makes you feel good.  I watch it almost every summer, and for a comedy to lend itself to repeated viewings is a rare thing indeed.

Plot Synopsis: Rachael Phelps, the ex-showgirl heiress to the Cleveland Indians Baseball franchise finds a loophole in the team's contract with the city saying that the team can leave the city if attendance is low enough.  With her eyes set on moving the team to Miami, she proceeds to put together a team that is sure to lose. Of course, they win!

Simple and sweet, Major League is a well-balanced movie that will entertain both sports enthusiasts as well as people who don't even know the first thing about baseball.  Lots of baseball action, one simple (but well-crafted) romantic subplot, and a cast of hilarious and fun-to-look-at characters make this one of the most engaging comedy movies of all time.

On another note, the screen presence of every actor and actress in this movie is phenomenal.  Sheen, Beringer, Corbin, Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes all in the same movie acting at the top of thier game.  Even those minor characters like Cerrano, Bob Ucker and the old veteran pitcher are acting thier hearts out here.  It's literally an All-Star team of great actors!

Anyway, I don't think I could justify the movie with an abbreviated review.  If you are a sports fan that like a good comedy - get this movie.",1091923200,8,2059,4.754929577464789
1182399,4,B000003KMM,"This is more a nostalgia note than a review, but most of this movie was filmed over one summer in Milwaukee (maybe Cleveland wasn't blue-collar enough). All the baseball action scenes were filmed in County Stadium, which is now a big parking lot for Miller Park. The crew invited locals to the filming at the Stadium and other locations about town, so it has a lot of local flavor. I went to the  filming of the big finale to be part of the ""rabid"" crowd so I'm in this move, kind of. It's fun to see Uecker do his stuff, and Pete Vukovich, a former Brewer pitcher, is perfect as Heywood, the Yankee nemesis.
People from out of town said County Stadium was a dog of a ballyard, but look for the scene when Berenger sneaks onto the field at night alone and pretends to hit one out. It sure looks pretty, and I miss it.",1083801600,3,817,4.237179487179487
1182400,5,B000003KMM,"It's not a deep drama and it won't make you ask you any tough questions of yourself, but Major League is pure entertainment from beginning to end. As such, it's my all-time favorite movie. It's easy to invest in the story (a Cleveland team made up of spare parts tries to overcome their owner's plot to move the franchise) even if it's been dated by the Indians' '90s success. The comedy doesn't pull any punches but still stays pretty tasteful, and I still find it laugh-out-loud funny even after 30+ viewings. The comedy is equal parts outstanding writing by David S. Ward and brilliant characterizations by the actors. James Gammon is dead-on as grizzled manager Lou Brown and Tom Berenger is actually sympathetic as journeyman catcher Jake Taylor. Dennis Haysbert and Corbin Bernsen give great performances, and Charlie Sheen is inimitable as Wild Thing Vaughn. I think any baseball fan will enjoy this movie, but fans of good comedy will probably like it, too.
The DVD has no special features (what else do you expect from Paramount?), but the picture and sound are good.

As far as baseball comedies go, this is by far the best ever.
As far as baseball movies go, this is near the top of the list.
As far as Charlie Sheen appearances go, this was his one shot at Oscar gold.
As far as opening songs go, this is the best one of all time, in any movie about any city or any sport or anything.
There's a red moon rising
On the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake (x2)
There's an oil barge winding
Down the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake (x2)
Cleveland, city of light, city of magic
Cleveland, city of light, you're calling me
Cleveland, even now I can remember
'Cause the Cuyahoga River
Goes smokin' through my dreams
Burn on, big river, burn on
Burn on, big river, burn on
Now the Lord can make you tumble
The Lord can make you turn
The Lord can make you overflow
And the Lord can make you burn

1182402,4,B000003KMM,"Years after this movie's release the Oakland A's defeated Red Sox in 12th inning with bases loaded bunt by catcher. That is what is so great about the movie...the baseball is grounded in realistic play and not artificial home runs as in the Natural.
Uecker and Gammons ( playing Manager Lou Brown) are terrific.
""Just a bit outside"" is now the classic comment for a really bad pitch.
Some of the voodoo stuff is overdone, but it is a fun movie",1065052800,5,443,4.481481481481482
1182403,2,B000003KMM,"The movie, a fictitious baseball story based on the real-life Cleveland Indians baseball team, is a little outdated.
When it was made in 1989, the Cleveland Indians, playing their home baseball games in a cavernous football stadium that had the capacity to house many fans but drew so few of them, were probably the epitome of baseball mediocrity and a very likely choice for a movie about a Cinderella-like baseball team.
But Chief Wahoo's followers have since gotten themselves an excellent new downtown stadium.  They've fallen on hard times again, but during the 1990's, they actually distinguished themselves as an American League powerhouse.  They came within 3 outs of winning a World Championship in 1997.
This movie predates that or perhaps it anticipates the rebirth of the Indians, but beyond that, there's little to be said on its behalf.
Take the greatest game in the world, baseball, and the greatest philosophy in the world, misogyny, and you appear to have an unbeatable combination for a movie.  But unfortunately, such is not the case here.
Oh yes, one can nod his head knowingly and agree that that's just what they're all like as the Indians' distaff owner (her character seems loosely based on Georgia Frontierre, owner of the Los Angeles/Anaheim/St. Louis Rams FOOTBALL team) tries to unman the dozens of hardworking baseball players who have too much pride to lose on schedule for her.
And there's some entertainment value in watching the lads get back at the dominatrix - defying her by continuing to win ballgames, as a photographic replica of her is stripped of clothing after each victory.
All that is fine, but basically the plot is so shallow that even the saving graces of baseball and misogyny can't really rescue it.
If you have any familiarity with baseball or sports movies, you won't be surprised by a single twist in plot that takes place during this movie - not a single one.  The plot twists have all the deceptiveness of a hanging curve ball and are as easy to read in advance.
In fact, if you have a grain of intelligence, I promise you that when you watch the movie for the first time, you'll have no problem guessing exactly - I said EXACTLY - how the movie ends.  You're not SUPPOSED to be able to guess, but I guarantee that you will.  That's how little imagination was exercised by the creators.
And of course, the creators didn't even MEAN to make a misogynistic movie to begin with.  This was one of Rene Russo's earlier movies, in which she began to establish her typecasted reputation as one of those disgusting ""gal pals"" (yeah right, like a man can actually be FRIENDS with the woman that he's sleeping with!).
Russo, as Tom Berenger's athletic girlfriend, is supposed to counterbalance the evil presented by Margaret Whitton.
But Russo's dramatic presence in this film is less than what was probably intended.  Her ""goodness"" (assuming that one feels that a female athlete can properly represent the forces of ""good"") actually casts a very thin shadow on this film and doesn't at all compare to Whitton's evil.  So the movie is at least realistic in this respect.
This movie is also an early Charlie Sheen effort, in which he stars as the hip closing relief pitcher Rick Vaughn, the ""Wild Thing"".  This character would later metamorphose into real-life National League closer Mitch Williams (Cubs, Phillies), who was known for being wildly effective (usually) in a way that would terrify his own fans.
In this movie, Vaughn's theme song, of course, is the rock-and-roll classic ""Wild Thing"", but instead of using the old Trogs sound-track for this purpose, the movie-makers have some all-girl group singing instead.
Now, does that make any sense?  To have an all-girl group sing (as the Trogs did), ""Wild Thing, you make my thing swing""?
No, the film-makers didn't TRY to make a misogynistic movie, but bless their hearts, they made one anyway.  It is, after all (heh-heh), the tale and not he who tells it, and commendations are in order for this accidental virtue.
James Gammons's reassuring masculine presence as the embattled Indians manager is another saving grace, and trivia buffs will also be interested in the presence of a younger Wesley Snipes.
Baseball!  Misogyny!  Familiar faces!  And yet the movie STILL doesn't satisfy.  I'll probably never find out if the sequel was an improvement.",1063324800,3,4351,4.899319727891156
1182404,5,B000003KMM,"As a baseball lover, I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  It's the classic ""cinderella story"" of a worst-to-first team, with the twist that they were assembled because management thought that they would never be able to succeed.  While the ending is pure feel-good 80's comedy, the journey is well worth the effort.  Several scenes are absolute classic cinematic moments, and Bob Uecker's ""just a bit outside..."" will live forever in the lexicon of baseball junkies.
Despite the light tone of the movie, the acting is good for a comedy, featuring younger versions of Renee Russo, Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Dennis Haysbert, and Wesley Snipes, just to name a few.  I watch this movie every winter to remind me just what I love about baseball--that anything can happen.  A joy to watch over and over again, although the special features are a bit weak on the DVD--all you get are a grainy trailer and some talent files.  Then again, it seems that most of my 80's favorites get shortchanged when they go to DVD, so that's nothing new and different.  I guess the studios are only interested in spending time and effort on new release blockbusters.  Too bad, as this movie definitely deserves a Bull Durham-like re-release on DVD.",1058486400,,1245,4.785046728971962
1182405,5,B000003KMM,"Major League is one of my favorite comedies and one of my favorite baseball movies.  The fact that it is a baseball comedy only makes things better.  The premise is that the Cleveland Indians have a new owner and she wants to move the team to Miami (because of the perks she'll get).  To do this, the attendance for the season has to dip below a certain number (800,000 I believe).  So, she gets rid of most of the regular players and invites a bunch of has-been and never-was players to training camp.  She tries to build a team designed to lose, and come in dead last.
Much is made of the fact that the Indians have not won a pennant in over 30 years and nobody expects them to do well.  The team is stocked with over the hill players like  Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger): a washed up catcher with bad knees who they found playing in the Mexican league, Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen): the third baseman who is scared of being hit by the ball; and players that never were stars like Rick Vaughn (Charlie Sheen): a pitcher with no control serving time in prison for stealing a car, and Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes): the centerfielder with blazing speed but can't hit, and Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert): a voodoo practicing slugger who can't hit a curveball.
With this misfit team, we go through Spring Training and the regular season.  As the season progresses the team starts playing better than the owner had hoped so she keeps taking away essentials like the team plane, the hot tub, hot water, and others.  The team plays even better until the whole plot is revealed by the General Manager of the franchise.  This gives the Indians the fire they need to be a contender and make a run for the post season (since this might be the only chance these players get).
Major League is an incredibly funny movie and remains one of my favorites.  I laugh at all the places I used to and I find the mix of baseball and humor in this movie to be nearly perfect.  One thing to note is that there is a lot of swearing in this movie and repeated use of the ""F"" word, so if that is the sort of thing that bothers you:  you have been warned.  Otherwise, this is one of the best baseball movie and is a blast to watch and watch again.",1058486400,10,2221,4.333333333333333

1182409,4,B000003KMM,"No, you're not going to walk away from this movie thinking about how to achieve world peace or end poverty, but you will be walking away with a smile.  MAJOR LEAGUE is a lighthearted, entertaining film that also happens to be hysterically funny.  Throw the great sport of baseball into the mix and MAJOR LEAGUE is a win/win for those who love the game and those who just want to have a good laugh.
There's nothing complicated about the plot.  When an aggressive femme fatale (Margaret Whitton) inherits the Cleveland Indians from her late husband, her plan is to put together a team so bad it will lose its fan base and allow her to relocate.  And so a band of misfits is put together:  washed-up players, inexperienced players, headcases.  Of course, predictably, her plan goes awry, but it's still good fun watching the antics of the Indians as they misfire and then come together over a long, long season.
Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Rene Russo, Corbin Bernsen, and Wesley Snipes headline a great cast.  Bob Uecker is absolutely hysterical.  My favorite character is manager Lou Brown (James Gammon) who delivers the film's funniest line, but one I dare not repeat here (it would never get past the editors)!

In the first place, this film is OBVIOUSLY CROPPED from the 4x3 format to make it look as though it's widescreen. This is NOT the theatrical ""widescreen"" release. Check out the opening scenes where the Indian's futility is told via a series of newspaper headlines of the times. Most of the headlines have the upper halves of the letters CHOPPED OFF! This is SHAMEFUL! The DVD's producers have actually given us LESS than the VHS tape. Second, there are NO, NONE, ZERO extras on this DVD. What exactly were we waiting all this time for?

When Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) inherits to team from her late husband, she concocts a plan to get the team to Miami by hiring a bunch of has-beens and never was-es. If they get dead last, she just might have her dreams come true. So signed onto the Cleveland Indians are manager Lou Brown (James Gammon), catcher Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger) who has bad knees, Rick 'Wild Thing' Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) who is a punk with an incredible pitching arm, a player who can't catch Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen), Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes) who may run like the wind but not hit a single ball, Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert) a man who relies on voodoo to try to improve his hits, and more. Of course the team goes through incredibly funny times as they get better at the same time Rachel Phelps give them a miserable time. So they come up with idea to stop Rachel Phelps; they'll just have to win the title! But will they ever be able to work together as a team? As starring is Rene Russo as Lynn Wells, Jake Taylor's ex-wife. Also there's Bob Uecker as Harry Doyle, the radio broadcaster for the Cleveland Indians.
Yes, probably just by reading my summary on ""Major League"", I'm sure you know how the story ends out. But hey, the movie entertains and humors with the sarcastic wit, hilarious jokes, obvious slapstick comedy, and laugh out loud situations. ""Major League"" fits right into the genre of a comedy, with all the actors doing a tremendously funny job. Everyone delivers there lines and plays their parts to perfection.
Unfortunately, the movie is R-rated for mostly the language. I guess all movies must have their moments of having to swear but ""Major League"" was a bit too much. Hence my 4 stars for this movie which could have been a 5 star movie!
Tom Berenger is extremely funny, and his scene where he follows his ex-wife to her fianc&eacute;'s house is just hilarious! Oh, and check out Charlie Sheen's funky haircut. He certainly plays his bad boy role well. His best moment is definitely the end. He walks out onto the field and as he does, the crowd goes wild and starts singing and shouting the song ""Wild Thing"". Charlie Sheen just handles his character of Rick ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn very well.
The movie is just filled with great one-liners and sarcastic remarks. Here are a few of my favorite lines:
(talking about the bad service on the plane)
Hayes: Vaughn, get the stewardess. I need one of those bags.
Vaughn: There aren't any stewardesses.
Hayes: Oh! I wonder if they are any pilots.
Harry Doyle: Remember, fans, Tuesday is Die Hard Night. Free admission for anyone who was actually alive the last time the Indians won the pennant.
Conclusion: Terrific movie but be warned that the language is most of the time too much. But ""Major League"" is entertaining and extremely funny so if you get a chance, check the movie out!",1030147200,7,2997,4.635338345864661
