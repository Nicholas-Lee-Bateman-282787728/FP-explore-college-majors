3761107,4,B001PSOCRS,"Deepak Chopra believes that when you are enlightened you feel you are one with God all the time. It seems to me that Christians can feel this way without believing they are God manifest in human forms. This three-part lecture explains Jesus' teachings in a new way as Deepak Chopra believes Jesus is a master of Enlightenment. Of course to Christians he is the way to God and the redeemer so much higher than an enlightened master.

This lecture reminds me of things I've learned while reading about Indian gurus and their devotees. There is a lot of discussion about consciousness and it makes the subject less mysterious.

Some of the topics Deepak covers include: love, the state of Grace, faith, karma (sowing and reaping) and prayer.

The 7 states of consciousness are also explained. I've gone as far as stage 5 but do not believe I'll ever attain 6 or 7 as to do so I'd have to believe I am God and I can't see that ever being useful to me or realistic. To me I'm still a soul who was created.

Also when Jesus said that he and the Father were one, he was literally saying HE was God. Not that WE are all God.

But if you are researching what unity consciousness means this is good for explaining what many New Age thinkers of today believe.

My only question really is: ""If we are all God then why are we destroying the earth and experiencing such horrors over the centuries?"" Obviously some beings on the earth are not loving and have perpetuated evil. So for that reason I don't think we are God. Why would God murder himself?

So you may come away from this lecture with a lot more questions than you imagined you would have.

Needless to say Deepak Chopra's voice is calming and enjoyable to listen to. I will say I understand more about ""enlightenment"" than I did before.

This DVD is based on the book ""The Third Jesus: The Christ We Cannot Ignore""
It is illustrates Jesus and the Christian teachings in a different light
It is in keeping with the teachings of Spirituality and Divine Consciousness
I find it is truly inspirational and stimulating",1239753600,22,353,4.709677419354839
3761109,5,B001PSOCRS,"It's all there, call it any name you wish, but once he begins to talk just remember to breathe.
Mr. Chopra so desperately wishes to experience ""The Profound"" I hope and pray he someday will.

8334617,5,B001PSOCRS,"I adore Deepak and all he says.. The only problem is that there is, is that I thought it was only suposed to be one disc and on the description it claims to be a two disc set.. I should have noticed this before, since I would have returned it",1354752000,,242,3.86
8334618,4,B001PSOCRS,"I always enjoy Deepak. After many years of learning through the spriitual teachers, I find Deepak is a man of deeo integrity and sincerity. I do wish his DVD's were a little longer which would allow more depth to his lectures via these DVD's. Yes, I think anyone can benfit from his teachings if they are wanting to go deeper into the spiritual teachings. I have many of his earlier books and I also suggest you check out his web site (Deepak Chopra.com) where you can see his other works.",1316995200,,489,4.444444444444445
8334619,4,B001PSOCRS,"If you're looking for true enlightenment you might not find it here. Chopra is a authoritative thinker with much wisdom to share, but most of ""Secrets"" is a rehash of things he has discussed before. For those new to his work this is a fine introduction, but for followers this video won't give you much new. It might be better to buy one of his numerous books.",1297641600,5,360,4.388059701492537
