7270395,1,B00Z710V6K,"Child 44, based on a popular airport novel by Tom Rob Smith, is a big, dowdy, lumbering dud.  It almost registers as a curiosity, an out-of-time anti-Soviet nightmare featuring many highly respected actors and which clearly cost a great deal to produce.  Any expended funds shall not be recouped.  The storyline is confused and labyrinthine.  The advertising portrays it as the story of a child predator rampaging through a 1950s Soviet Union in which no comrade will admit murders, deemed a symptom of capitalism, ever transpire in Stalin's paradise.  Except, of course, for one strong-arm secret policeman, Leo (Tom Hardy), for whom the investigation raises intense, but ultimately productive moral and political quandaries.  And this is, in a way, the central thrust, but, wow, can this film move laboriously and lose focus.  There are so many dour subplots, incoherent transitions, and poorly defined tensions, as if they ballooned a 90-minute picture with extraneous notes of self-importance or crudely cut a season of television down to feature length.  The child murders only come to fore an hour into a film lasting a numbing, feels-even-longer 2 hours and twenty minutes, and the identity of the culprit is revealed with the grace of a particularly uninspired episode of Criminal Minds.

The gargantuan problem of storytelling and thematic opacity, as well as lax pacing, is compounded by a wildly ugly aesthetic, full of brown-on-grey medium shots and, during chase and fight sequences, disorienting editing.  (It is appropriate the story is resolved with three central characters mud wrestling in what could be a pit of diarrhea.)  Also rather ugly?  The rogues' gallery of questionable Russian accents, with performers of many nationalitiesAustralian, English, French, Swedishtrying their mouthful-of-borscht best with distracting and inconsistent results, although even in a film as bad as this, Hardy remains a charismatic and imposing presence.  Through the cinematic debris, the actor who impressed us so much in, among other films, Bronson, Lawless, and Locke remains recognizable.  Everyone else is either squandered or miscast.",1434758400,14,2146,5.444108761329305
7270396,3,B00Z710V6K,"Leo (Tom Hardy) is attempting to solve a series of children's murders. The government denies they are taking place. He is sent from Moscow to Volsk, but the murders continue.

I had a hard time digesting the theme. The murders are being denied because.... the children are having their organs harvested? The killer is a powerful person they are protecting? Nope. ""Murder is a capitalist disease."" The film shows us the brief history of Leo. his love for his wife, and the accusations and dealing with traitors.

Perhaps the problem I had with the film was that the culture seemed so alien, I had a hard time relating and getting into the film.

7270435,5,B00Z710V6K,"This actor makes everything interesting.  He brings so many layers,  not unlike Marlon Brando,  so many layers to his characters that others
can be left behind.  can be but arent.  Hardy makes sure everyone gets a ticket for his roller coaster.

  The premise is simply that in Russia no one could commit murder,  because it is a capitalist corruption,  not a communist one.  We communists could not commit murder.  And so it is very,  very difficult to investigate murder.  this,  amidst so dangerous infighting and social shuffling that
unlike New York City, say,  where a mistake costs you . your job,  there a mistake costs you everything and maybe even your life. Certainly
there was alot of pressure to turn in wives at some point in Russian post war society.

  someone is killing boys and leaving thier bodies near the railroad tracks.  It has been going on for years.  this stroy finds one man with the
stamina to investigate under pressure not to investigate.  Gary Oldman as always is lovely to watch,  and while in this one role he is a little
unconvincing,  just a little,  becasue i don't know why his character is so gaddamn angry,  and it distracts me.

  The long train ride and the fight there in seemed a bit..  gratuitous,  but perhaps it was written in to show the shift of the unfaithful wife
into the faithful wife.  at any rate,  there is redemption,  which is all we long for in film where children are killed.  And there is hope.

as always i enjoy a glimpse into Soviety Russia during those days when we were not allowed to look into each others eyes.",1496102400,,1578,4.566787003610108

7270443,4,B00Z710V6K,"We watch movies to be transported out of our mental here and now. But for that to happen, the currents of EMOTION must be created.

The emotions catalyzed by this movie are quite dark. You will be transported into a high tension, gloomy, gray world in which anyone can be an enemy. You will walk on eggshells along with the actors. You will think to yourself, ""I am so glad that I wasn't born in that country, during those times."" ""How can anyone live that way?"" ""I'd rather be dead than to live in such hell.""

This is a movie that hits you on the gut. And for that reason, you may not want to watch it again. Yet, if you are one who appreciates the power of cinema to carry us into a different world, you will love this movie on that principle. It quite effectively delivers.

There was another reviewer who said that even though nothing bothers him anymore, the ending made him cry like a leaky faucet. Having read that review, I kept alert for that ending delivery. I was glad that he didn't spoil it for me, for I was totally thinking that the ending would be something else. The gaskets too, blew out in this two spout faucets. And this is why I will not spoil it for you.

I didn't give it a perfect rating because I felt that in the real red Russia, during that time, when there was so much corruption and little value placed on human life; I seriously doubted that things would take such a 360 degree turn. I had to keep telling myself, ""Its a movie...Its entertainment.""

If you want to feel grateful for what you have, where you live, and the quality of your loved ones lives, watch this film. It is very well done.",1489622400,10,1626,4.283387622149837

7270451,4,B00Z710V6K,"Read the book and never knew it was made into a movie until recently. I'm a fan of Tom Hardy and Noomi Rappace and figured if they were in the movie it'd be good. I was not disappointed.

I've always found the Soviet Union way of life during the Cold War fascinating in a historical point of view. How so many millions could have succumbed to mad dictators for generations is mind-boggling. The movie does a good job describing their way of life, and how their country known as 'A Worker's Paradise' could have no such thing as 'serial killers' I believe was the mindset of Soviet leaders keeping an iron fist throughout the country.

Tom Hardy proves his a true actor, changing his accent in convincible style, and Noomi Rappace is excellent as his wife. Gary Oldman is another favorite actor of mine, but his role is minimal. If you read the book you won't be disappointed.

Tom Hardy plays Leo, a WWII Soviet Hero now working as a high-rank State Militia Officer. His best friend's child is killed in what is first described as a train accident, however, evidence points to a murder. But in a 'Worker's Paradise' such things do not happen. Leo convinces his friend not to pursue the matter over his son's death, but the child's mother (another close friend of Leo) shames him into doing otherwise. This act costs Leo his job, and he is demoted and shipped off to an obscure city where the mass Soviet civilians are forced to work and live (which is to say a life of poverty.).

Leo finds another murder and puts two and two together, realizing the killer is traveling from city to city in search of child victims. His boss (Oldman) wants him to drop the matter lest they both be demoted and shipped off to someplace worse. Eventually Oldman embraces a search for the murderer and the hunt is on. Meanwhile, Leo's wife comes under suspicion by a ruthless policeman and she confesses her true feelings to her husband, which come as a shock to him, rocking Leo right down to the core.",1486166400,4,1984,4.533519553072626

This movie is about the percarious life the Russians lived in Russia just after Stalin died.  So many of the Stalin supporters were in positions of power in the Russian goverrnment, and these Stalin supporters were surreptitiously irradicating those people who were visibly against Stalin without the government's knowledge.  These actions were finally revealed when one of these Stalin supporter henchmen, gets an order to kill his wife, he rebels and with his wife, goes underground and tries to find out who has been obducting young boys and killing them.  Through this inquiry, he ultimately brings down these Stalin supporters and their actions.

7270477,4,B00Z710V6K,"""Child 44"" the movie, is a visual treat for anyone who's read the book. The lost and lacking parts in the movie production, based on negative reviews, I believe can be attributed to not providing the childhood background of Leo Demidov, the main character. The book captures you with Leo's family beginnings, which help connect the entire story. There are hints of what drives Leo in the movie, but with only knowing his parents were dead and he spent time in an orphanage, the beginning and continued driving force is weakened.

Many viewers of the movie also seem to miss and/or make light of the fact that under the supposed perfection of Stalinist Russia, ""there is no murder in paradise."" This quote is driving everything in the movie. To survive in a country ruled by a dictator who denies anything bad, like murder, could exist in ""his"" paradise is madness. And so we watch the madness and fear infect everyone in this story, one way or another,

As with my feelings about the book, this is a movie you experience and not so much just observe from a distance. I thought it a tragically great experience.",1481155200,,1110,4.658163265306122

In long - here we go:

OK, why was there a need to take a serial killer from the 1980's and 1990's and place him in the early 1950's when he would have been a teenager. Fine, let's file this under ""Creative License"".

The choice of the main character as one of the men who installed the Soviet flag over Reichstag is very strange. If the author of the novel wanted to indicate the ""untouchable"" status of the protagonist, there were other options. This one is pathetically lazy.

The cultural details are so wrong. But that is pretty much what Hollywood is all about - crappy, shallow, inaccurate representations of non-American cultures. The portrayals of men and women are beyond ridiculous.

The conflicts between characters are superficial and drawn out in an unbearable ways.

The whole movie is long for no reason. You can't find anyone to sympathize or identify with. Characters in this movie are incomprehensible. And for a good reason.

The affects are seen in 1953 when the action in the film takes place.
Leo was one of these children. He grew up, married, and became a high official in Russia. He discovers that someone is killing young children. The government does not want to accept the fact because Stalin is insisting that Russia is a paradise and no murder occurs in paradise. Leo faces much opposition from the authorities. Making matters worse is that he once struck a fellow officer who wants revenge, and this officer is in love with Leo's wife. What also complicates matters is the fear that getting involved with Leo will lead to being killed by the government. Also complicating matters is the states insistence that Leos wife is a traitor. The fear that Russian citizens have for government officials also affects Leos marriage.",1466467200,,1089,4.989010989010989

So much was cut out and/or just completely changed it was as if these were two totally separate stories. The backstory, that would have better explained the relationships between the characters and their motivations (most particularly Leo's and the killer, Raisa and Vasily), was deleted. This is why at times the film just didn't make sense. I've also watched Citizen X which is an excellent made-for-tv movie about this same serial killer Andre Chikatilo but feel it's unfair to compare the two. Citizen X is more of a history (similar to a documentary) of Chikatilo's life whereas Child 44 creates a fictionalized story based upon his life. I strongly urge you to read the book.

Surely, I thought, there are numerous similarities.  However, the warmth I felt from the characters in Citizen X was certainly missing.

Part way into about the second half, my wife mentioned seeing this movie or something like it before we were married.  She, too, had confused this with Citizen X.

There IS no warm and fuzzy feeling in this movie.  The one likable character is played by Tom Hardy .  Beyond that, allthese characters fell as if they belonged from the Soviet era with their heads down so as not to attract attention.  This is not an entertaining movie in the way I feel entertainment is meant to be.  This is more of a peek into a forbifden society where, as we are occasionally reminded, Comrade Stalin says there are no murders in paradise [therefore, no murderers].

This, while not being particularily gory, is a hard movie to watch.  That, for what it's worth, makes it a good one TO watch.",1456012800,,1193,5.253968253968254

7270593,4,B00Z710V6K,"Child 44 is a pretty good suspense with easy to understand Russian accents (I'm guessing these actors aren't really Russian though because they talk a little *too* clear- I know Noomi Rapace is actually Swedish).

There seems to be two stories going on here.  The first story, the bigger one, is that a group of Russian military police investigators try to put together the clues concerning the sick man behind the killings and raping of young boys.  This guy lures young boys behind trains and kills them.  Luckily we don't actually see the killings and rapes- they're either implied or we see brief glimpses of the luring process, but the scenes never carry out entirely.  It would have been too much to handle!  Anyway these police investigators go all around town including the forest to search for clues.

The other story is that Noomi Rapace is a traitor, however this portion of the story is confusing to me because I don't quite understand what's going on half the time.  All I know is that she's not loyal to Russia in some way.  This is most likely due to me not understanding either Russian history.  Hey our public schools never brought up Russia once during history class even through several years of World War II history, the period this movie is based in, a tragedy I know.

Or perhaps I'm thinking too deep into this, and it's a matter of me not understanding how investigations work in Russia.  Anyway sometimes Noomi visits her family (or a family) and everything appears to be fine- other times she's sneaking out of town with assistance of the Russians to lay low somewhere else (she's a school teacher but doesn't exactly get the job she wants when she's positioned to the bathroom it would appear).  Other times she's incredibly worried for her life with guns pointing at the back of her head.  These scenes are REALLY hard to watch.

I did NOT like the opening segment showing a small country family getting shot in the back of the head.  This scene was VERY gruesome to watch and I didn't like it at all.  I was worried the children would be next, but thankfully one of the soldiers stops his Russian partner from going through with it.  The film stars several actors such as Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy and Joel Kinnaman.  None of these people are actually Russian that I know of.  Gary and Tom are both British and Joel's Swedish/American.

Anyway the acting is really good, the picture shows Russia accurately (being cloudy, dark and gloomy most of the time- then again the story itself is supposed to be dark and gloomy) and the storyline, while confusing at times, is mostly enticing.  Best of all the suspense is fairly high and the story never drags.  Worth watching.",1451779200,,2694,4.661016949152542

7270601,5,B00Z710V6K,"In this age, when at best, were usually just offered anti-heroes whose actions are only admirable in that they are decisive and ferocious  here at last we get a true hero from the old school. In this film, Tom Hardy plays Leo, an indeed leonine character whose actions shine through as a singular beacon in an otherwise depressing, oppressive regime. His character persists in tracking a child killer through all the denial, resistance, bureaucracy, and brutality, of Stalinist Russia.

Then theres also something of an unusual romantic reversal here. Whereas most couples start out in love, then fall into permanent disaffection  here we see Raisas feelings flowing in the opposite direction. She marries Leo thinking he is merely another uniformed functionary, whom its her sad lot to have to marry. But she comes to see the true depths of the individual as the action progresses.

This movie might well inspire viewers to see that we can all strive to be better and to do the right thing, even in the bleakest of circumstances. It is however, not for the faint of heart. Theres a seemingly inexorable train of violence and cruelty running through everyones life on this grim terrain.

7270611,5,B00Z710V6K,"I thought it was an entirely watchable film, interesting twists and turns, and not at all deserving of the bad reviews.  It wasn't a great film, but it was definitely worth seeing and i would recommend it to anyone, adult, really.  Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman portrayed their characters with their usual competence and subtlety.  I enjoyed the character development but also the tenseness and paranoia that the art direction and soundtrack helped to  show of this time.  It must have been so nervewracking for people.

I am sorta feeling for Noomi Rapace...the characters that she plays since The Girl with Dragon Tattoo series have just not had the range that that character had.  But she always knocks some scenes out of the park when given the chance, in every film. And here too.

Tom Hardy continues his run with creating characters and choosing to do films where we can see great depth in portrayal of poignant human dilemmas.  This is work #2 of a portrayal of a male character trying to to the right thing in circumstances where he has to hurt others to survive.  His work on what to do in degraded socio-political environments is nothing short of ...really profound.

It took me two or three viewings, again, to get the nuance of these performances, and to begin to break down the narrative arc through action and response.  Agency and containment.  Really really interesting.

When I first reviewed this (this is an edited version), I gave it four stars.  I am upping it to five stars, simply because I am now able after repeated viewings to place it in my LEARNED A LOT category of films where I try to understand the difficulties of the situations that so many face in life.

Recommended, really.  It is much better than many films.  I am not going to repeat the plot, just sayin', go ahead and get it.",1448409600,,1812,4.644654088050315

7270647,3,B00Z710V6K,"Starring Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman, produced by Ridley Scott and directed by Daniel Espinosa you would have thought that this movie would be a sure fire hit. However, while not actually a complete lemon, it is far from the powerful thriller that promotional content suggests. Given that it was written by one of the team that brought us The Wire you could be excused for expecting carefully managed pace and suspense, flashes of wit and tight, efficient plotting. What is delivered, however, is something totally different.

The first half of the film is a turgid examination of Stalinist Russia, filmed in near monochrome sepia dimness it is nearly impossibly to distinguish between characters thanks to shonky accents and identical military uniforms. There is no shortage of heavy handed brutality and a clunky, obvious portrayal of the horrors of the period. Not that Im trying to downplay the appalling abuses of the epoch, it is just that it makes for a very slow start to a supposed thriller.

Things do finally get going, however, and once youve worked out whos who and what is actually the main storyline (which is by no means immediately obvious) the film becomes much more engaging. Enter Gary Oldman  at last, some semblance of a plot and some actual pace and direction to the meandering narrative thread as the investigation into a series of seeming unrelated child murders gathers speed towards what should have been a tidy and satisfactory conclusion. Again, however, this film failed to deliver, instead rushing to a quick ending leaving the viewer with a couple of very unsatisfactory plot chasms (not just holes).

This could have been a cracking film but the sluggish start and sloppy plotting really spoilt the good bit in the middle. Not a truly dreadful film, just not a very good one.",1445731200,2,1806,4.911475409836066

7270669,5,B00Z710V6K,"Those who (like myself) have read the book bearing the same title might feel that many bits have been left out and a number of things have been changed. So they have, and this is hardly avoidable when shooting a two and half hour film inspired by a multi hundred pages book.

However, there are some elements, the main ones in my view, which are still very much there and even amplified because this is a film. Three stand out particularly and all of them are features of life under a Totalitarian regime (the films action takes place just at the end of Stalins reign).

One is the atmosphere of generalised fear and, at times, of barely suppressed terror that the film exudes almost continuously. All characters are subject to it, because all of them know that their future can suddenly take a turn for the worst, even those belonging to the Secret Police. This is exemplified by the terrifying knock of the door and any time of day and night, and everything that it such arbitrary arrests suggest, including interrogation  i.e. torture - and forced confessions of largely imagery crimes. This is also shown in the film with the fall and contrast between before and after being exemplified by Demidov (Tom Hardy), an official hero of the Soviet Union and a previously well-regarded Secret Police officer.

The second is the concept of official truth, which Demidov transgresses, and pays the price for it, before finally accepting at the end of the film. He first makes the crucial mistake of wanting to find out who killed his colleague/friends son. Under a regime which is supposed to have created paradise on Earth and to be the incarnation of perfection, there can be no murder and no murderer so that Demidovs behaviour can only be anti-socialist. He pays it by being arrested, demoted and exiled, along with his unloving wife (Noomi Rapace whose performance is quite superb) who only married him because she was afraid of what he was and felt she could not say no.

The third feature is that under such a regime, nobody is safe and there is no rule of law, no stability and no truth. Anyone can be accused by anyone else, including colleagues, friends or even family under the slightest pretext and purged, regardless of whether they are guilty of anything. Human life is essentially valueless. Everything is subordinated to the Party line and to its leader, both of which can change without the slightest notice. Facts are fabricated to suit a given purpose and when the truth emerges, and really becomes inconvenient, new facts are invented to fit it.

Those familiar with George Orwells 1984, with Arthur Koestlers Darkness at Noon or with life under such totalitarian regimes will not doubt recognise these features and appreciate how they are displayed in the film. Also very much on display is the attention given to details of equipment, dresses, uniforms and everyday life more generally.

The end of the film might leave you with somewhat mixed feelings. Demidov, actively helped by his new boss  an ageing general of the Milicia superbly played by Gary Oldman  will manage to uncover the truth and find who murdered his friends son. However, the cost will be high for some and, once uncovered, the truth is quickly buried under a new official versus and more lies that Demidov, this time, will accept, or at least pretend to accept to stay alive.

There was one element which did not plat out very well. Partly because of the need for dramatic effects and partly because the director chose to have some fast-paced action, the sense of time is somewhat lost. In the film, you get the impression that the action takes place over a few weeks. In the book, it takes much longer than that for Demidov to find the murderer who was supposed not to exist. Five stars all the same, essentially because of the three features mentioned above.",1445126400,,3848,4.755622188905547

Even though the story line in the film does not duplicate the real criminal story in every datail (the real serial killer was not a surgeon), it is in any case a very good movie, and gives us a picture of the Stalinist era as well as the consequences. (He may have dragged Russia into the 20th Century, but at what cost?)  The acting is outstanding as European acting consistently tends to be, and the entire aura seems to capture the paranoia of the Soviet communist era.  The film begins by establishing the political environment (and indeed how it influences personal relationships), which then perfectly encompasses the crime story - a story within a story.  Another aspect of films taking place in the Soviet Union/Russia is the presence and influence of the Russian railway system, with grey steam pouring out of their smokestacks, the red star at her helm, the high pitched screeching whistle, and brakes; in some films plowing through deep snow; carrying passengers in well appointed passenger cars or in freight cars; from Dr. Zivago, to Anna Karenina, to this film as well, the railway system plays a major role and is emblematic of Mother Russia.  At times, it also has the feel of a stage play and film as well.  Great movie, outstanding acting!  Add it to your collection.",1444867200,2,1298,4.767857142857143

The movie itself was all over the place, BORING, and not one single person sounded genuinely Russian (though I give an A+ because the accents were at least attempted instead of pulling a Prince of Persia and just having everyone speak in a British accent). I can honestly say that unless you've read the boo, you'll finish this movie going ""wtf just happened?"". Heck, even if you've read the book, you'll be wondering that as well.

Opens with Senior Lieutenant Leo Demidov, a hero of WW2 and steadfast officer of the Soviet Union. His primary responsibility is civil control. Manage the populace by ensuring disobedience is met with swift and harsh justice; enforcing the right way. And the right way is Soviet.

A functionary of the MGB, a defunct communist state service whose modern equivalent would be: A police officer who simultaneously serves in the military plus a counter-terrorist FBI agent AND a dogmatic communist theorist - all rolled into one job with the added bonus of having zero constitutional rights for the citizenry.

Bottom line - no one bleeps with with the MGB.

Demidov's a hard man who delivers The Right Way on a daily basis.

But even a party man like himself has a fault: He can never admit when he's wrong. Never.

Ironically, that fault is a crime within the Soviet Union. Why? Because only the state can be correct all the time. And he's about to become a criminal within the very system of hypocrisy he's enforced all those years.

A young child is murdered on his watch.

Yet, in The Worker's Paradise, there can be no murder. The perfect society cannot produce a person who can be murdered unless there is a deviation from Soviet policy and The Right Way. The state has made its pronouncement - the child's death was due to an accident. It's his job to inform the grieving parents, who happen to be his best friends in the world, that their child was killed by a train. That their son's body shows signs of torture - his internal organs having been removed with surgical precision - doesn't seem to be an issue for the state.

And it's just one of several children who have been accidentally ""killed by a train"".

Leo knows this cannot be true. And he cannot be wrong. But he is. His punishment - endure the insanity that communism produces.

Now, at first, I have to admit, I was very upset at this production. It was my own fault having broken one of the cardinal rules about cinema - Don't Go In With An Expectation. And having absolutely nothing to do with the true horror that was Andrei Chikatilo didn't help matters because I kept replaying '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-X/dp/B00KG2R73U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen X</a>' in my mind.

Made worse since the filmmakers re-imagined that monster into a one-dimensional caricature, complete with a self-imposed water-boarding scene. Essentially making a mockery of the brave men who worked tirelessly to capture the real Rostov Ripper; and a profound disservice to real-life hero Major Viktor Burakov.

Yet, something an old brick-n-mortar guy shared with me came back while screening this film. Consigned to the fond memories of youth, I had long since passed that phase where comic books had any relevance. Still, even knowing this, he would often write to me about some new graphic novel - aka The Adult Comic Book - that he insisted I had to read.

One in particular stood out.

It told the story of Batman if he had lived in 19th Century. Surprisingly, I found myself really enjoying the tale of Bruce Wayne in a steampunk world. And that's when this movie finally clicked. It suddenly made sense.

Child 44 is an alternate timeline of history. Not unlike asking any number of hypotheticals which would yield a different tale than the facts of reality.

So with a fresh slate, I would say this was an excellent film. My deep affection for Tom Hardy, arguably the greatest actor of his generation, along with Rapace, Clarke, and Oldman - delivered the deep believable performances of the people they were portraying. And with an incredible eye for detail, Director Daniel Espinosa perfectly captured the feel of the 1950s Soviet Era.

That the plot itself was a retread rubber-stamp narrative from any number of similar movies definitely detracts. But, again, the ultra sharp mechanics of the production and the incredibly rich portrayals won me over.",1443139200,,4107,4.944767441860465

I think Citizen X was a better movie IF you want to know the true story.  Child 44 adds a fictional story to the account.  This is a bleak story line with a small glimmer of hope. The downtrodden characters that you think would just settle for existing decide instead they will risk further persecution and turmoil for the good of others.  Some have expressed that the bleakness of communism is what stuck with them from this movie.  I see something else.  As Tom Hardy's character says ""We're already dead"".  What makes this a good movie for me is characters with no hope of a good future for themselves still try to do what they can for the existence of other people around them.",1442534400,,849,4.496732026143791

7270775,4,B00Z710V6K,"Directed by Daniel Espinosa (SAFE HOUSE), and starring Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace (among others), CHILD 44 tells the story of one man's effort to bring a serial child murderer to justice in a society where the mere existence of murder is denied. The society in question was Soviet Russia, ca. 1953, and the existence of such evil things was basically unthinkable/untenable in what was ostensibly a ""worker's paradise."" In a general sense, based on the lackluster reception from both audiences and critics, I wasn't expecting too much from this. I didn't too much care for Daniel Espinosa's previous film, SAFE HOUSE, but he does have a gritty style that I appreciate. What interested me more was the incredible cast he assembled for what I thought was going to be a rather simple, if protracted (at 137 minutes), crime procedural. What I got actually spent more time on the human drama, which I didn't mind at all, although more time could have been spent on moving the plot forward in what was a film with a rather languid pace. I also took some issue initially with a non-Russian cast putting on their best Russian accents. Some do better than others (Noomi Rapace, in particular), but for the most part I got used it and it never really bothered me after about 20-30 minutes. What the film does really well is examine Soviet Russian society in the 1950's, with all of the paranoia, backstabbing and low standard of living for the common person. In that respect, the milieu the film portrays and the way in which it is portrayed create an atmosphere that all but chokes out any sense of justice or hope. That's what makes the central characters' journey so compelling, aside from being well-written. You feel for them because the odds are not in their favor, and yet they continue to pursue a goal that puts their lives at risk. Also, in a more general sense the film explores the degree to which people will lie to themselves and others in order to avoid an inconvenient truth. When looked at from this perspective, the quote which opens the film (""There is no murder in paradise"") becomes, not a statement of fact, but a mantra repeated to stave off the knowledge that the world we live in is anything but a paradise. Although the film does take its time getting into gear, the journey it takes you on is well worth the wait and, despite the downbeat tone, it does have a fitting ending. Also, to the film's credit there were a few moments of violence that made me flinch. With the way movie audiences have become desensitized to violence, it was refreshing to have a film where it serves a purpose and has real impact. Overall, this isn't really a film that I'd soon watch again (due to the depressing subject matter), but is something that should be seen by more than have already. Don't believe the negative buzz and just give it a try.",1442102400,3,2843,4.620553359683795

The film is not perfect but it held my attention throughout.  Maybe that's due to my interest in WWII and Stalinist Russia(?).  It's filmed in muted tones which adds to the already somber subject matter and probably puts some folks off - I liked it.  The music is also treated more like a soundscape which probably also put folks off - I liked that also.  The performances are all very well done but would have liked all the accents to be more similar.  Either have all speak the King's English or all speak fake Russian but the mixture of both was off-putting.  The biggest negative for me was leaving out the main plot line of the killer and the cop being brothers - this gave the book most of its essence.  Considering the screenplay kept every other convoluted aspect of the novel, this was a real head scratcher.  Still I would recommend this film to anyone interested in an adult oriented movie.

If there was one good thing then it would have to be the conclusion and it was a great ending to a sordid tale. I just felt so very tired and beat by the end of the movie the superb ending wasn't enough to soften the landing. If this was a portrayal of real life then I pray for all the souls that had to live through this or anything like it.

1) Made me simultaneously interested in the USSR and extremely glad I did not live there.
2) Captivating storyline with many layers: the Joseph-style rise and fall of a noble man, a broken marriage that becomes beautiful, twisted villains who hate the truth, orphaned children who gain parents. It's the sort of story that can work in any setting, but works especially well in a totalitarian society where 2 + 2 = 5 and you can't trust anyone.
3) The execution. The plot is sensational, but the movie isn't. Everything is intelligently understated. You honestly have to work a little to understand the story; they don't spoon-feed the plot points.
4) Tom Hardy. He doesn't show a ton of range, but then again, he plays a man who can't. Leo Demidov must think one thing while saying another, be one man while acting another. Everything Hardy does looks bottled up to the breaking point. Very powerful. Also, he had the best Russian accent of the lot.",1441670400,3,982,4.742690058479532

7270802,2,B00Z710V6K,Quality acting & scenery but the story was slow going and a long night for me. Two stories here that never really felt joined. The children being murdered and Hardy's wife possibly being a spy/rat. Which took up a majority of the movie. They bounced back and forth like two different movies.  I wish the script would've stuck soley to the investigation of the kids found near the train tracks. This is one of those films that feels like it could and should end at any time but keeps rolling along with the same somber tone. There was an intense exchange between Oldman telling Hardy to not go over his head. I wish they would've played up this theme more to give the film a better punch with these two dynamic actors. Talky scenes prevailed.,1441670400,,741,4.488888888888889

7270819,2,B00Z710V6K,"If you're looking for an example of how to take an impeccable cast, best-selling novel and high-level concept and forge a muddy, depressing, overlong death-march, this is it. Like some post cold-war throwback, this is the sort of film that constantly reminds you that you're lucky to live on the 'right side' of the iron curtain while wondering why Russians talk with such funny accents.

With a plot looser than many first-draft scripts, the most exciting and colorful action sequence happens right at the start while the finale is a whimper. The main character (Hardy) has no motivation to endlessly pursue the killer. destroy his career and kill his family. Rapace is unlikable throughout the entire flick and Kinneman is wasted as a monotone, two-dimension villain bested by even the tritest of TV cop shows. By the time the audience works out the main thrust of the narrative, it's too late to care and while editing is one of the many problems here, it's the relentlessly bleak, over-long and unfocused nature of the picture that kills it for the viewer.

Overall, it's a thrill-less thriller that has pretensions of investigating the importance of finding a child killer in a society that denies the existence of murder. The story is uneven, simultaneously introducing too many distracting subplots while failing to follow the key ones thoroughly enough. While some of the lame plotting would be forgiven with more interesting characters, the combination of silly plot developments, expository dialog and confusing direction neuter any attempt by a skilled cast to save it. Add a thick serving of laughably fake Russian accents and this would be better suited as a made-for-TV movie or a drinking game where you take a shot every time something unbelievable happens.",1441497600,,1773,5.068493150684931

Also, NO movie is made ""just like the book"" since reading a book is subjective and based on the pictures you formulate in your mind - which is the whole purpose.

7270914,3,B00Z710V6K,"You would think that by sinking $50 million into an international film, it might have been distributed a little more aggressively.  This thriller set in Russia sneaked into American theaters in early May, 2015 and quickly departed.  While the movie isn't great, slotting it within reach of summer blockbusters wasn't a good idea either.  So is the movie as bad as most critics and a missing audience thought it was?  Well, no.

The film is set in Russia/The Soviet Union beginning in the mid 1930's.  Stalin is reigning roughshod over the country, eliminating trouble makers.  Three boys, at least one orphaned, are placed into the military and soon will be fighting the Nazis.  Leo (Tom Hardy), Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) and Alexei (Fares Fares) play the 3 as grown-ups.  Leo has his picture taken when his platoon capture a previously held German outpost and becomes an overnight hero.  All 3 become career soldiers, with Leo obtaining a senior post as an officer in the secret police.

It is now 1953 and Leo is charged with outing supposed traitors to the Communist ideal.  Looking for a supposed ""intellectual"" (Jason Clarke), Leo saves 2 innocent girls from execution by Vasili, himself somewhat of a coward during the aforementioned battle in Germany.  Too much time is spent, comparing the Soviet system with the Capitalistic society of the West.  The rationale which is drilled into our head is the system doesn't work, the greed leads to excess and murder.  And there are no murders in Russia, explained as ""murder doesn't happen in paradise.""  Well in this bleak, dreary Russia, murder is committed by the authorities on a regular basis.  But what about a serial killer who is on the loose and killing young boys?

When one of those boys turns out to be Alexei's son and Leo's godson, Leo is asked by Alexei to intervene.  The authorities have claimed the death was caused by being hit by a train.  But everyone knows better.  When director Daniel Espinosa (""Safe House"") stays with the police procedural aspects of the story, it is really quite interesting.  Leo has to dance around the investigation at the same time must juggle an inquiry of his wife, Raisa (Noomi Rapace) who is suspected of associating with the wrong people or something.  When Leo can't find any evidence of wrong doing, he and Raisa are sent on the next train to a dreary factory town run by General Nesterov (Gary Oldman).  Leo is now just a foot soldier and Raisa, a teacher, is assigned to latrine duty.  When a child's murder is discovered, Leo convinces Nesterov that it is no train accident.

At 137 minutes, the film is much too long, filled with contrivances, open questions and unnecessary complications.  The good news is that the photography is terrific, providing a sense of life in Stalin's hell.  Strong performances by Hardy and Rapace provide reason enough to take a look if you have the time.",1440633600,,2891,4.821138211382114
7270915,5,B00Z710V6K,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Tom Hardy is becoming a force to be reckoned with. An actor who has found himself in numerous roles that are demanding and always able to meet the challenge, he has yet to break the bonds of stardom for some reason. His is not a name that most will instantly connect with stardom but perhaps his turn as Mad Max this past summer will change all that. Until it happens by all means catch any and every movie he makes to witness a great actor, starting with this newly released movie, CHILD 44.

The movie begins a decade before WWII when a young Ukrainian orphan is adopted by a Russian soldier. Fast forward to WWII as the Russians are set to take down Berlin. Hardy stars as Leo Demidov, that young boy grown and a soldier who is chosen to raise the Russian flag over the city and thus becomes an icon for the heroes of the war. Among his compatriots are his best friend Alexi (Fares Fares) and a soldier named Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) who seems more intent on cringing in fear than doing his duty.

The war ends and Leo becomes a pro-Stalin security officer, tracking down those unfaithful to the country and its leader. Life has treated him well and his notoriety from the picture has helped advance him to this point. He ignores the actual ruling style of those in charge since hes a part of it. He adores his wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) but subtle hints from her make you wonder if the feeling is mutual.

Leos world is turned upside down when he is presented with his next case and person to investigate. That person is his wife Raisa. As Leo finds himself torn as to what to do another incident crashes down upon him. The son of his best friend and colleague Alexi is found murdered near the train tracks. But murder is something that cannot happen in Russia but only a capitalist society and the death is ruled an accident, the murderer not even sought.

When Leo reports that there is nothing to the accusations found against Raisa his world is turned upside down. With Vasili now in charge of the government organization looking into the matter, he strips Leo of his rank, lets the couple pack a few things and sends them to a much smaller town where he will work as an investigator under General Nesterov (Gary Oldman). Gone are the days of parties and social events with the couple now forced to share a flat.  The subtle truth behind what seemed to be a perfect marriage has changed as well with Raisa revealing more about where they really stand than Leo realized.

When the body of a young boy is found near the train tracks of this town, Leo takes an interest. He tells them things about the body that he should not know, but all are memories of the facts of his friends sons death. As he talks with his superior and explains all he knows, the pair decide that this killer must be found, even if it means taking on the propaganda machine of the country. As they prepare to do what they must to find the killer, Vasili continues to haunt Leos world and demean him as much as possible. His motivations fall back to Leo and Alexis witness to his cowardice all those years ago rather than advancing the party. Will this be enough for him to thwart the investigation into the crimes of a murderer who they find to have had 43 previous victims? And will Leo and Raisa be able to uncover the secrets that protect this killer from justice?

Based on the acclaimed novel by Tom Rob Smith (who went on to write more novels involving these characters) the movie has a sumptuous look to it in set design, countryside and styling that does a painstaking job at recreating the past. As we watched the movie my wife talked about how great the movie looked, something she rarely does. Shes right. It looks great. It looks like a movie that should have been playing for several weeks at the local theater. But for some reason it was rushed to DVD which is a shame. Its better movie than that and deserved to be noticed.

Hardy does another tremendous job of acting here, presenting a character that is flawed but who discovers who he truly is before the movie finishes. Not only does he find his world turned upside down with all he believed called into question, he rises from the ashes to do the job he seems to have been born to do, to become an actual detective. Rapace matches him scene for scene, offering the troubled woman whose own life changes, rises and falls, with that of her husband. By the films end how they came together no longer matters.

What make this movie works so well though is its story. Not just the story but the culmination of the work put in by all to make this story one that involves the viewer to the point you don't look at the actors as actors but actually begin to think of them as the characters they are so immersed in portraying. Everything from the directing to the craftsmanship behind the scenes works toward the common goal of telling this story. And in the end all viewers benefit from that. This is a movie that never got attention but deserves it. It is one worth renting or adding to your collection.",1440547200,,5098,4.419595314164004

Yet the acting is absolutely incredible.  If you're an actor, watch this.  Incredible performances.  More said in a facial expression than in a line of dialogue!  I find that beautiful and impressive.

The settings and costumes were perfect.  This film really had the ability to be a major piece of historical entertainment.  It just drags on and on.  That coupled with the horribly depressing lifestyles of people under a communist regime make Child 44 hard to watch--hard to finish, frankly.

7270947,4,B00Z710V6K,"There were so many positives about this movie. One has to be in awe of getting that many people at a crowded train station to move on cue and do all that they are supposed to do.  A thousand little things have to be in the right spot and this movie....did indeed have it all together and not just once but many times as the scenes dictated.  I have been to this area of the world in the 1980s and I have to say... The way the people dressed.....darting of the eyes...the shabby clothes....the complete and utter distrust of everyone was so very authentic. The actors also did such a good job making the audience feel that any moment the bottom was going to fall out...and indeed... that is how the people acted during the cold war when I visited. I won't bore you with regurgitating the story line....as you can get that by watching the trailer. The movie did a good job with the horrific nature of the crime being committed by this cereal killer.....there wasn't any gore. However, unless you have read the book...I thought that the movie rather glazed over exactly what Stalin put those people through by starving them to death. I also thought the movie explained poorly the pathology of our ""deranged"" killer. (A small scene where the killer is practicing ""water boarding"" on himself ....left me going....'What the heck?"") Many people live thru horrific atrocities and they do not end up being sadistic child killers. There are a couple of other small scenes in the movie that just seem ""put of place""....like the one I just described. The hero in our movie......goes from being a national hero with a bit of money, power and influence to being stripped of everything. That is realistic in a communist government. Heck it is realistic in capitalistic America. One day you have a job, home and health insurance. Within three months....your not only jobless but homeless and without health insurance. Fortunes do change in an instant. All of the actors did a good job. However, I  thought the marriage between Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace seemed forced. I also felt misled about how much Gary Oldman's part was. From the trailer....I thought his part was much bigger, when in fact, he isn't in the movie very much. Overall it is a good flick.

7270970,5,B00Z710V6K,"I saw this movie a few days ago, and its still with me, which is usually a testament to its ability to penetrate and affect.  Despite or perhaps because of some of the negative reviews by the critics, I found it important to write this.
If you have ever wondered what it was like to live in the Soviet Union, this movie will explain it to you.  I know this, because I grew up there, because my childhood and early adulthood were spent in the Soviet brand of communism.  If you ever wondered why did the people not rebel, why was the KGB allowed to abuse and subjugate people, why people chose to live as they have, this movie will explain it to you with imagery that you will not soon forget.  Watching it was like jumping back into my childhood, frightening and comfortable all at once, as often happens with reminders of our childhood, no matter how forbidding they may seem to outsiders.
I know the point of this movie was to address the hunt for a terrible serial killer, but even a child murderer plot became secondary to the machine that Russian communism was in the 30s, 40s, and 50s.  For every Russian person who has nostalgia over those days, I urge you to watch this. It will cure you of it with reminders you don't want to relive (and yet some do there right now).
The acting was superb.  The main character, played by Tom Hardy, did a fantastic job.  The machine of the Russian secret police, always existing in one shape or another since the tsarist era, was portrayed with a ruthless aim, and our main protagonist was a wonder to behold  a part of that machine, a loyal keg, and yet with a hint of wistful Russian style romance, love of country, and fundamental ethics, all of which are tested and proven.  I can personally attest that even for me, Toms performance was so complete, I sensed a KGB agent in him through the screen.  His character is at once, imposing, frightening in its relentless pursuit, meaningful in his presence, and captivating in the wielding of its power.  All characters in contact with him involuntarily spin around his axis, and this is the magic of how well he played this part  you wonder if the power this man wields was the cause of him occupying such a high ranking post in one of the most powerful agencies in the world, or if it is the agency that naturally created the monster and the hero, all at once, we ourselves are spinning around.  When his own wife says late in the movie that KGB (which was called MGB at the time, prior to 54) was written all over him when she first saw him, I had no trouble agreeing with her.  If that man ended up on our doorstep, I would immediately know our lives would be over.
If nothing else, Russias disavowal of this movie as historically inaccurate should prove its accuracy.
For my part, I could attest that every part and parcel of how this movie portrays 50s Russia is correct, down to the fear based lies, the sudden arrest and murder of citizens under mere suspicion, and the disavowal that communist Russia could ever produce a murderer.

I gave this movie 5 stars because rarely does a movie affect me so deeply on a personal level.  This is a feat in itself.",1439856000,,3155,4.423143350604491

7271041,3,B00Z710V6K,"On the face of it this is actually a well made film. The plot is that Hardy playing Leo Demidov is a State Security officer in Stalin's Russia, he has a chequered past and was supposedly at the fall of the Reichstag in Berlin at the close of WW II- the historical inaccuracies around this part are woeful - but in the need for a good story - thoroughly acceptable. For example -one soldier is too scared to fire his machine gun - now they have just fought across half a continent to have gotten the colly wobbles at this point is a bit disingenuous and that is no matter how much it helps to contrive the plot later. The flag bit is also completely made up.

Then we move on to the present day and he sort of uncovers a child murderer serial killer - but as the political wheel turns he is forced to denounce his wife as some sort of spy. Refusing to do so he is demoted and sent to some arse end of nowhere place where he meets Gary Oldman and decides to carry on the search for the killer.

Now this is from the trilogy by Tom Rob-Smith and out of necessity they have missed a lot out in this 132 minute film; but you still get the basic gist. The period detail is great, the acting all passable - the false Russian accents are ok in places. A word in defence of the actors - they at least try to do the accents but like many I prefer the original language. Also people are a bit too emotional in places - this was Stalinist Russia you were only allowed to get emotional when either tractor production targets were exceeded or there was a bumper turnip harvest - fact!

That aside it is watchable it has a fair bit of plot but not a lot of chemistry and there are times when you wonder what their motivation is or what the point is. This could be down to direction or editing, but this ends up being a film where it is lesser than the sum of its parts. It is still an ok watch - hence my rating.",1439596800,,1897,4.066844919786096

The subject matter of this film, about a serial killer who prays on 'tween' boys, is beyond gruesome but thankfully the visuals are managed carefully. Excellent, excellent acting and story. Even the smallest part is carefully cast, you will recognize name actors here in very small parts. I don't know anything about Tom Hardy, have not seen Mad Max reboot yet, but WOW.

How this film did not get a theatrical release is a crime. (If it did I saw nothing promoting it, and I live in LA.)  The studio probably tested it at a strip mall in Chatsworth and panicked. It is tough viewing, but WORTH IT.

The film is also important because we have pretty much forgotten how awful and evil the Soviets were to their satellites and even their own citizens, yet the film shows that there were moral men within the system who were heroic in their efforts to keep some of their humanity and not just save their own asses.

That goal soon becomes almost lost in the machinations and cover-ups of the government apparatchiks.  The movie is a veritable lesson in the sociology of the Soviet era, when nobody was immune from random persecution, even to the point of execution; nobody was to be trusted, least of all family members; and the promise of the Soviet ""worker's paradise"" was little more than an object lesson in honing the most primitive of skills in order to survive that cruel, grueling environment.  In certain respects, the dead were the lucky ones.

7271090,5,B00Z710V6K,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Serial killers terrify and fascinate me.  Not to sound morbid, but the idea that a person could do something so heinous as to torture and kill another person is mystifying to me.  But at the same time, just knowing they exist is enough to make me lose sleep at night.  When children are thrown into the mix, specifically as targets of a particular killer, now THAT is enough to make me squeamish on many levels.  For this reason, I knew CHILD 44 was a must-see for me, and I loved it.  Epic on a monumental scale, this film is enthralling, from start to finish.

I was concerned about the running time of the film, which clocks in at over two hours in length.  Many films that long tend to drag in the middle, thus making a boring movie experience.  Thankfully, my concerns were unfounded.  The run-time is perfect, and the movie keeps a nice, steady pace.

The cinematography in CHILD 44 is beautiful, and the movie is shot with a sense of grace.  I would daresay it is artistic in some places.  This helps to enhance the movie experience and immerse the viewer in the film.

The acting is excellent, with Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace portraying the leads.  Ive been a fan of Hardys work for many years, while Rapace continues to impress me with her diverse acting ability.  I read reviews that complained about their Russian accents, but I think both do a top-notch job with them.  Likewise, Gary Oldman shines as a compliment to Hardy and Rapace.

The story in CHILD 44 is engaging and intense.  Granted, it is lengthy, but it needs to be to help build the tension.  I particularly like the complexity of the subplots as they relate to the main storyline.  Just when you think a certain scene has nothing to do with the story, it comes full circle and you realize it is necessary to help build the plot.  The resolution at the end of the film is also satisfying and just; I will not reveal anything, but I will say I was happy with how things wound up.

CHILD 44 is a major win for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller.  The acting performances are phenomenal, the story is intense and intriguing, and the movie as a whole is gorgeous.  You just cant ask for much more.

7271097,3,B00Z710V6K,"The cast is an excellent one, and the premise for the movie is promising.  Moreover, the general production in terms of set and filming is very good.  However, the movie feels a bit disjointed and far-fetched.  One gets the sense that anyone can be randomly denounced at any moment and suffer a catastrophic fall.  The sense of vulnerability borders on flippancy, and as such, doesn't seem very believable.  Tom Hardy is a war hero, and though celebrated people could surely suffer falls in the Soviet Union, his seems so swift and complete as to seem far-fetched.  I'd call it overdone in a basic sense.  I also thought that the storyline of his wife not being in love with him (marrying him out of fear) didn't ring true and felt like a distraction.  Hardy's character is a smart fellow, and though one should never discount the power of self-deception and willed ignorance, he seems to have no idea that his wife doesn't share his feelings.  I think a character like Hardy would realize that his wife doesn't share his feelings.",1439078400,3,1031,4.715083798882682

7271099,5,B00Z710V6K,"This is a powerful movie. The storyline is well-plotted and the acting is superb. There were some moments where I found myself a trifle lost - what happened to Vasili? How did they happen to go to just the right factory? - but I think the chief effect that the movie had on me was to set me wondering about my inability to imagine how I could live in a society that expected a husband to denounce a wife or that claimed there could be no murders in paradise.

Tom Hardy is an MGB officer in Stalinist Russia in 1953. (The MGB was the predecessor to the KGB.) His job is to ""investigate"" espionage, and he seems quite content to do so, and seems to believe that is really what he is doing, although we see scenes that could have come from a witch-hunt, where one person who was no more guilty of espionage than anyone else was expected to denounce other people, strangers, names chosen at random, whatever, just to make the torture end, and then to get the surcease of suffering from a bullet to the back of the head in an interior courtyard. Families of traitors are summarily executed, leaving their orphans to remember the terror as a warning to others, as we see in one of the opening scenes.

It is a wonder that this culture did not produce an entire culture of people walking around with untreated psychiatric conditions, particularly when you consider that this same population had been brutalized by invented famines and Nazi invasions.

We can also understand how this culture could mass produce sadists.

Hardy's character is set-up to denounce his wife, but he is basically a man of honor and, while tempted to do so, on the calculus that it is better to spare his entire family by sacrificing his wife, he cannot bring himself to do so when he learns that she is pregnant.  He is sent in disgrace to the ""ass"" of Russia where he learns that a child has been tortured, killed and gutted. He was investigating a case in Moscow with the same indications and discerns that there is a serial killer at work, albeit that term is not used since it would be anachronistic.

From that point on he has to deal with Soviet politics and betrayals as he tries to uncover the murderer. While he is searching for the killer, his sadistic former underling is searching for him. He learns that his wife  - who he clearly loves and who he has sacrificed everything for - married him out of terror of the MGB.

I think that last point will stick with me. What was it like to live in a culture that was so terrified? How psychotic must the world have been to the average Russian that they had to deny reality - they actually had to affirm delusions - or die?

I will not give away the story any further, except to say that, yes, I too was crying at the conclusion, when Hardy is engaging in an act of atonement while wondering whether he is a monster.",1438992000,3,2843,4.4

Tom 's character Leo is a security officer pursuing what Stalin dubbed as enemies of the state, which anyone could become.  When a death of child hits home, Leo also, embarks on the pursuit of the killer, he more than proves himself up to task in spite of the hopelessness of situation.

With less than one minute into the movie I realized what a downhill spiral this would be and instantly regretted my $16 purchase...

Caution Spoilers:

As a reader I understand that you can't put every detail into the movie version, but to completely remove the background plot that gave Leo and Andrei a relationship as brothers completely null and voids the point of the murders.

Names are changed, it is now apparently always Summertime in Russia, Leo and Vasili are now brothers (what?), and the method of the murderers has been altered and then left entirely unexplained. Removal of the children's stomachs now no longer carries any meaningful purpose, but was kept, for what I can only assume, was a ""gruesome detail"".

After having my hopes dashed for a decent storyline the only saving grace I could foresee in this film was the appearance of Gary Oldman.

How wrong I was.

While this film is set in Russia I struggled to find one reliable Russian accent, save for the consistent work from Tom Hardy.

I felt like an idiot, watching in silent horror as the story I had grown to love unfurled into a jumbled, cluttered mess. My partner, having listened to my hype of the book for days, strained to understand the muddled accents and slowly lost interest.

I'm baffled. They had an astounding $50,000,000 budget. What happened?

I am truly disappointed that the only scenes I could enjoy were the panoramic sweeping shots of the cities and train.

Next time, I'll trust Rotten Tomatoes and not my book-loving heart. :(",1438560000,,1772,4.777049180327869

7271160,3,B00Z710V6K,"[The following review may contain minor spoilers.]

Based on Tom Rob Smiths 2008 novel of the same title, Child 44 follows the story of Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy), a dutiful MGB (Ministry for State Security) officer and his wife Raisa Demidova (Noomi Rapace) under Stalins rule. Leos faith to the nation is severely tested when the mutilated body of the son of Leos old friend is found. Because there is no murder in paradise, however, the case is hushed up.

Later on, Leo, disgraced and sidelined, starts investigating the case that could be done by a serial killer. General Nesterov (Gary Oldman) is helpful, but Leo has to be very careful because in uncovering the truths he has to deal with not only the murderer, but the Soviet bureaucracy represented by a sneaky officer Vasili Nikitin (Joel Kinnaman). Paddy Considine, Jason Clarke, and Vincent Cassel also appear.

Written by Richard Price (The Color of Money Sea of Love), the script of Child 44 attempts to cover too many territories like Stalinism and Holodomor. To be sure, the film benefits from the strong acting from the leads Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace (this is part a love story) and director Daniel Espinosa (Easy Money Safe House) does his best to keep up the pace, but with the limited success, especially in the second half of the story, in which things happen in a too incredible way (the transport train scene is just one of them).

The film (and its original book) is of course inspired by the real-life serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. The subject matter is covered in a made-for-TV film Citizen X starring Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland, which I think is better as a crime or political thriller.

Child 44 is a decent thriller with fine performances from the cast and a few intense moments, but as a whole disappointing trying too hard.",1437955200,42,1812,4.75796178343949

I refuse to let the difference from the book take from the movie. This is one of my favorite movie this year. It kept me interested to the end. The acting I believe was amazing from all the actress and actores. 5 stars all the way. If you read the book, I hope you give the movie a chance and vice versa.

7271168,5,B00Z710V6K,"Excellent film about a child killer on the loose in Russia. The actors were brilliant, the cinematography dark and foreboding as the plot of the story and the writing superior, as well. I would recommend CHILD 44 to anyone, especially those with an interest in crime stories; fiction and non-fiction, as an earlier movie that also took place in Russia about another serial killer named Andre Chikitillo who killed over 50 people during the 80's and 90's, called CITIZEN X.
I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this movie, but I'm now very glad that I did because it was an excellent film.",1437696000,45,602,4.688679245283019
7271169,4,B00Z710V6K,"Although not a remake, Child 44 remind us of the excellent 1995 movie Citizen X.
It refers to a serial killer in the USSR that was killing children close to railway station,
a story that reminds us of the Butcher of Rostov, Andrei Chikatilo that confessed to a total of 56 murders, many among them children.
But the movie here is darker,but rather there is more
emphasis on the characters participating, and the pressures and restrictions imposed
by the Soviet state to its people, even security forces personnel. And Tom Hardy's heavy
Soviet-English accent makes things even darker at times.
It seems at times that the serial killer is the Soviet state.
Of course, the movie has its share of violent scenes, crafty created to be brutal and socking,
yet short and not that bloody
It is a good movie to watch, but not for all times. Because it has a really sad theme
and the slow pace of the movie ads to the difficulty of watching it at all times.
The actors are excellent, photography is really good if you like that kind of grim films,
and the plot drags you in, making you think about the killings, the Soviet era, state oppression,
the terrifying knock at the door from security services.",1437696000,4,1192,4.60093896713615

7271174,5,B00Z710V6K,"3 stars??? seriously? Folks who rated this film by less than 4 stars should better stick with Power Rangers movies or Star Trek ones. Child 44 (2015) is a historical crime-thriller set in the 1950's Soviet Union, during the chaos and reign of terror which followed directly after Stalin's death.  The protagonist of the story is a man named Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) who works for the internal security (political police force).  He lives in a lavish apartment for its times with his wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) {the two also started together in a film The Drop (2014)}.  Leo at first is a staunch believer in the system he is representing and defending; however, he starts to question the system once he begins to investigate gruesome murders of young boys by a serial killer no one seems to believe exists...

I think the story of the film is loosely based on the notorious Soviet serial killer by the name of Andrei Chikatilo.

What I like most about this film is that it is a time piece set in an interesting Soviet Union time period with a serial killer/detective type of context, while at the same time the film is able to capture the extent of love and sacrifice between the two main characters.  Also, the director and the film-crew did a magnificent job creating a believable setting for the film, which was filmed in Czech Republic, Romania, UK, and Russia.  The movie authentically captures the atmosphere of the 1950's in Soviet Union.  Too bad, nothing is mentioned (no scene included) about the power struggle nor the death of Joseph Stalin.",1437436800,35,1551,4.718518518518518

8719518,3,B00Z710V6K,"Self-serious, contrived nonsense with mediocre performances by Hardy and Rapace. Hardy is a better actor than this; Rapace should stick to kicking bad guys' asses in action flicks. Gary Oldman is as reliable as ever, though. The movie isn't bad at getting across the tension and inherent danger of being a domestic spymaster in a Stalinesque regime (this time, literally) but it gets tedious, and you don't feel for the characters all that much in the end. The movie is basically a middle-brow mediocrity, an attempt to meld a serial-killer whodunnit thriller with historical fiction. That it is somewhat based on true events doesn't save it.",1529884800,,642,5.066037735849057

8719522,2,B00Z710V6K,"Citizen X was better. This was well done, with good acting, but it came off as propaganda.  I haven't read the novel maybe it's better....but after awhile Tom Hardy (who I love don't get me wrong) just lapsed off into broken english, and there were a few Girl With The Dragon Tattoo moments which lacked context.  The thing that actually bothered me the most was that this movie belittled the investigation of  Andrei Chikatilo, the serial killer who actually committed these murders. While the metaphor of comparing Stalin's Russia to the enablement of these crimes is poignant, it also denies fact, and belittles what the investigators actually achieved.  If this movie sparked any interest in you at all, I hope you will look into the truth, and not just sate your emotions.",1525824000,,777,4.863636363636363
