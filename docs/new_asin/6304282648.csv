7867067,2,6304282648,A no go for me and for a friend who co-starred in it later to find the poor taste in it all.,1312243200,,92,3.227272727272727
7867068,1,6304282648,"This movie is absolutely horrible. It did not make me laugh, it did not make me care at all for the main character, and it did not entertain me.  The only reasons to even watch this movie are that ""End of the Line"" by the Traveling Wilburys is played over the opening and closing credits, and George Harrison and David Byrne make cameos.",1099440000,,337,4.349206349206349

7867070,5,6304282648,"This was a superb film, seemingly about death but truly about life, it's there to be enjoyed, much like this film (sorry that sounds so cheesy but thats a fact)",998784000,3,160,4.366666666666666
