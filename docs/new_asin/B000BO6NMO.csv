2431756,5,B000BO6NMO,We played this video for the Young Women in my church this past Sunday and leaders and girls alike were laughing.  The dancing kilt man was hilarious!  There are some hidden jokes for the older folks and some innocent comedy for the younger.  Would definitely recommend this.  Gives advice on anger management with comedy and simple advice that everyone can understand and relate to.,1185148800,2,383,4.9375
2431757,5,B000BO6NMO,"We love Junior's Giants!  It couldn't be any better!  I hope they produce tons of these!  I hear that there is a #2 out there, but I can't find it anywhere to buy.

Oh, and unlike the other reviewer, I thought that the ""Anger's Everywhere"" rendition of ""Love is in the Air"" Was super funny!  My kids bust out for that and disco dance through the house to it.  There is just something funny about a kilt-wearing angry scottsman singing while disco dancing. :)",1168905600,,458,4.392857142857143
2431758,5,B000BO6NMO,"Our whole family watched this movie, and all but the dog enjoyed it.

The story is well-written with humor that appeals to all ages, and multiple sub-plots keep things interesting.  The screenplay had fun lines that our own family has been repeating, such as ""painful... and dangerous"", and ""excellent parenting moment"".

The only downside, in my opinion, was the somewhat cheesy ""Anger's Everywhere"" sung to the tune of ""Love is in the Air"".",1138233600,4,442,5.027397260273973
8090045,3,B000BO6NMO,"Stupid. Didn't like it and the ""message"" was totally lost on any of my kids younger than 10.",1514246400,,92,4.166666666666667
8090046,1,B000BO6NMO,Great movie! Preowned description was a lie. The movie and case were both so dirty. Gross.,1505520000,,90,4.6875
8090047,5,B000BO6NMO,"I own two of the DVD's. I loaned them to a friend the other day and her son loved them. They are more modernistic, but have great meanings. Great purchase and price.",1400025600,,165,4.1875
8090048,4,B000BO6NMO,"I love the people who create such wonderful programs for kids that teach them how to control and understand their emotions. What a blessing in today's every changing, self absorbed intolerant world.",1367452800,,198,5.21875
8090049,5,B000BO6NMO,"Now a days it is hard to find good comedy, more over this movie is flatout funny. Praise God for christian comedy! Kids love it, parents love it, you'll love it!",1359936000,,161,4.225806451612903
8090050,5,B000BO6NMO,"While I have to admit I have not sat down and watched this entire video with my kids (I'm actually not sure I've watched THIS one at all), I've seen and heard enough to know it's a great video.  They seem to like it pretty well (boys ages almost 7 and almost 9) and it teaches a great lesson.  I love any video that entertains my kids while teaching them Biblical principles :).",1358985600,,378,4.164383561643835
8090051,5,B000BO6NMO,"This DVD is hilarious, but still manages to deliver a great message to kids. It holds their attention with great music and animation, while keeping it humorous enough for adults to enjoy it as well. Pure genius!",1326153600,,211,4.72972972972973
8090052,5,B000BO6NMO,"This was an excellent little 30 minute video on anger. It is unrealistic to think a child won't get angry and this show how to deal with it in a more productive way. The idea that Christianity has no violence is silly, read the bible, hence ""David and Goliath"" theme. That was pretty violent. I hope they make a bunch of these. We loved it and my almost 6 year old laughed out loud! Thanks for making an upbeat way to discuss anger issues.",1266710400,3,439,4.238095238095238
8090053,5,B000BO6NMO,Rich characters and funny dialog.  My kids loved it!  Simple Biblical truths with easy to implement advice backed up with Bible verses.  The giant was very original and knee-slapping hilarious!,1265328000,2,193,5.366666666666666
8090054,1,B000BO6NMO,"Any biblical message intended is negated by the 'Tom and Jerry' style violence and back handed satire. There is no whimsy involved! This entire video is a back handed satirical slap to Christians! The family depicted is like a comedy making fun of Christians. This movie is one packed example of what NOT to emulate! The Christian family who carefully guards media will likely NOT appreciate this title at all! This was a real waste of money. Would not recommend this DVD.

The kid(s) sleep and look board in Sunday school, get hit with golf balls and clubs, lies for money.... Just say NO NO NO to this one!  This is a small example of concern from the show. If you bring this home watch it yourself first!",1221868800,4,707,4.515625
