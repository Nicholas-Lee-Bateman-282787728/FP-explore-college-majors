919875,3,630474529X,"This was some sequel, even though Fong Sai Yuk 2 seemed it had lost a little of it's touch. Unlike the first one, the sequel was just not that amazing. I think one of my biggest dissapoints about this film is about the  main villain, Mr. Wu. His skills just wasn't that good, if you have seen  the prequel of this one; You would know that the bad guy in Fong Sai Yuk 1  was A LOT better. He was just as good as Jet Li. If the villain could have  been a little more exciting to watch and his martial arts was just a notch  higher. This could have been another masterpiece. The first fight in this  movie between Fong and Wu really starts us off. It appears about 15 minutes  after the opening scene. They were jumping 30 feet into the air and kicking  bricks and other things. It was incredible, one of the coolest part was  when Wu was kicking the concrete off the ground towards Jet Li!  There were  a lot of fight scenes, about 1 in every 15 minutes. Right after Fong and  Wu, we go to beat up some samauries. And there was this Japanese guy that  can block all your nerves and paralyze you by just touching you with his  fingers. Sounds pretty cool. But I didn't think the finale was too good.  There was too much bricks thrown at each other while Fong was trying to  save his mom from Wu. In conclusion, this was average. I recommend you to  rent if you haven't seen it yet(And oh yeah, they say this was a comedy, I  didn't find any of the jokes in this movie humurous).",959817600,,1475,4.133802816901408
919876,5,630474529X,"While I try not to review the movies that aren't available anymore I had to spill out a 5-star review for this awesome sequel. I got my hands on an origional vhs copy the other day after a ton of internet searching and boy was I glad. This is my favourite of the un-findables that go out of print....I could probably watch this one a good 100 times,the fight scenes are the most intense I have ever seen,and while I said Tai-Chi Master,Fire Dragon, Iron Monkey(93),and Fist of Legend are the best fight movies available today,FONG SAI YUK II is the best fight movie which is un-avilable today. I guarantee you'll never see Jet Li kick so much ass as he does in this movie and he turns into a hardcore killer by the end of the movie with the last two classic fight scenes,first he kills about a hundred or more of his Red Flower brothers who turned against him sporting ten samurai swords at his waist,blind folded,in a alley with red rose pettles floating everywhere(awesome)then he saves his mom from the main villain and finishes him off with about 1,000 hit or so combo(I lost count) which explodes his back and sends him flying into his chair. A classic movie if I ever seen one and a must find(keep searching!) but hopefully it will be re-realeasd some day.",959472000,,1262,4.491304347826087
919877,4,630474529X,"Amusing and entertaining as the first, though probably not as well made as the first one. The sequel has a different atmosphere, more of a light comedy compared to the action oriented first flick. Contact riget@webtv.net  for info on how get this one and the first one at a more affordable price.",949795200,,296,4.6923076923076925
919878,4,630474529X,"Out of the window with continuity and realism, and in with the dazzling jet li. this movie never fails to exceed your expectations, or the limits of its possibilities. Suspend your disbelief and see one of the best kung  fu movies of modern times.",935971200,,247,4.613636363636363

7876678,4,630474529X,Fong sai yuk 1 keeps stopping and am not enjoying it at all.obviously I have to returned it back immediately,1402531200,,108,4.45
7876679,3,630474529X,"Like the prequel, I saw this movie on cable, and found myself enjoying it.  It's another one of those movies that you get for a rainy day, and the fact that I've got both just makes it even better.",1370563200,,197,4.051282051282051
7876680,2,630474529X,"Fantastic film however not what I ordered, the product desciption states the original manderin and cantonese soundtracks however the one I recieved only has the english sound track which is a terrible translation.

In short a great film if you can find the cantonese soundtrack.",1213747200,6,278,5.177777777777778
7876681,5,630474529X,"Simply a fantastic movie. This is one of Jet Li's best. Though there are some wire work, its fantastic work. The Villain is excellent, along with honor, secrets and humor. And I mean gut busting humor. The fighting scenes are fantastic. The Characters are believable. One of the more awesome parts of the movie is when Jet Li's mother is in trouble, and Fong Sai Yuk played by one other then Jet Li' he blind folds himself and says he is guided by heaven. What happens next is to die for. If your a Jet Li fan get this one, Its better then the first one. And has to be one of his best performances. If your not a Jet Fan but want to see an awesome Kung Fu movie with lots of action then you don't want to miss Fong Sai Yuk II. Its the Best!.",1209081600,2,741,4.0476190476190474
7876682,2,630474529X,"I like old school kung fu like: 7 Grand Masters,36 Chambers,Sleeping Fist, but this is too fake and super sped up. If you like Jet Li it may be for you. It was just too crazy for me. I turned it off after about ten min. Trying to sell it",1197936000,,237,3.76
7876683,5,630474529X,"Jet Li is explosive in this movie just like in his other non-english speaking roles. He takes the old style of martial arts movies and makes them extremely good. He is a very good actor even though alot of his movies are rated badly now. The story for FSY2 is a good story with excellent characters to back it up!
His other movies""Romeo must die"",""Kiss of the Dragon"",and""The One"" were not written to his talent. If Jet Li would have taken the part in ""Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon"" it would have fitted him better on his type of fighting. He need to keep doing the old style of martial arts movies!",1010966400,,600,4.463636363636364
7876684,3,630474529X,"The final fight in this movie must be seen to be believed. Actually most of the fight scenes must be seen to be believed. Therein lies the problem...the rest of the movie (i.e. the story, the characters, etc) aren't really missed. The fights scenes are fantastic, but without any coherent reason for there to be a fight going on, it takes away from the enjoyment.",998784000,,363,4.6
7876685,3,630474529X,"This movie I thought was pretty good. It has a lot of very comical humorous scenes as well as breathtaking action scenes. If you're a Jet Li fan who loves his movies, but also looking for a laugh, this is the movie  to get. I myself got a few laughs out of this movie. Shows how Jet Li is  capable of both Comedy and Action.",963446400,,324,3.9692307692307693
