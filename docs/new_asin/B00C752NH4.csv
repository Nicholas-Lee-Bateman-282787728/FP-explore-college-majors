5692314,5,B00C752NH4,"This is the 4th and 5th DVD of the Maya Fiennes Mantras of Kundalini Yoga Series.
I do love Maya Fiennes, and own all of her kundalini yoga DVD's.  Of all her DVD's I feel this one is the most calming and relaxing.  However, I also found it extremly challlenging to complete. The poses are less complicated and easier to do, but held for much longer than the usual excercises. The themes are reapeated as well, so if you didn't really like one excercise, well there it is again.  Perhaps they are challenging because they are really balancing the hormones and drawing out the 'yin' energy of the body.  The actual mantra portion was very easy to do, but again, it goes on for a while.
I gave it five stars because it is a stellar program and a wonderful yoga experience.  Use it on the days you need a milder workout, but still could use a challenge.",1370304000,21,850,4.3544303797468356
8577877,5,B00C752NH4,"Maya Fiennes is the best kundalini yoga video instructor I've seen.  I always feel calm, invigorated and inspired when I do these videos.  Writing this review reminds me that I need to do yoga soon, I've been slacking off and I love how I feel after I've done one of maya's sessions.",1506470400,,283,4.423076923076923

8577880,3,B00C752NH4,The Accept Love session felt great! A couple of odd positionings in Balance Your Hormones...didn't flow didn't feel right. The mantra session was ok!,1434499200,,149,5.25
8577881,5,B00C752NH4,"It is a good dvd box-set to have.  I practiced one disc for 2 weeks and then the second dvd for another two weeks. I liked that very much.  Maya Fiennes dvd motivated me to get up very early in the morning to practice. It gave me instant energy to go to the gym, to any spin classes, and I can run on the treadmill for 30 mins without stopping since I started the breathing method.  I could not run more than 3 mins before.  If you want to have a good waistline and a good perspective daily, try Maya's method.  The ""Healing"" dvd and ""Wisdom"" dvd are the best way to start. My new found energy motivated a few people around me to practice this type of breathing, including my children.  I have done Chi Kung for a while, but I found the Indian way of breathing is funner and more addictive.  It took 45 mins a day and you can see the results.  Maya put all these poses and chanting in a special way, it just works gradually in your daily life.  You can see the results of your children and friends in just a week.  Keep it up ............",1411084800,3,1038,4.094059405940594

8577883,3,B00C752NH4,"I like Maya Fiennes videos because she chooses and combines very powerful kriyas and mantras/meditations that leave me in a great space. However sometimes the execution is a bit sloppy, I've seen videos where her description of the exercise and what she was actually differed quite a bit.

Here the sequence ""Balance the Hormones"" is a kriya taught by Yogi Bhajan and the 5th exercise is done differently than on this video. With wide legs you do a sit up and for the first 3 minutes you bend forward in the middle between your legs instead of resting the head over the right knee for three minutes. It makes a lot more sense than to do the right leg twice and the left leg once.

Another mistake is in the SaTaNaMa chanting. Every description of this kriya (called Kirtan Kriya or SaTaNaMa Meditation if you want to look it up) stresses that it's important to have each part (aloud, whisper, silent) for the same amount of time, in this video the silent part is only half the length of the others.

It often seems to me like she doesn't test the videos before they release them. She talks all through an exercise that involves rubbing your ears but it's not possible to listen and rub your ears at the same time. To end this exercise it would be nice to have a gong or something instead of her just softly starting to talk again, missing it, and then rewinding to find out what you're supposed to be doing next (pull on the ear lobes!).

Having said all this it's still one of my favourite routines, I really think it helps with PMS and leaves me more balanced and calm. I often do it in the week before my period (with corrections).",1399939200,6,1634,4.4186046511627906

8577885,5,B00C752NH4,"maya fiennes is definitely one of my favorite yoga teachers and this dvd is one of her best.  I glow after I do the accept love, and I feel as if I am in a different dimension, very beautiful and loving feeling.",1376092800,11,211,4.023809523809524
8577886,5,B00C752NH4,I love all Maya's DVD's money well spent! i also enjoy her music. She is part of my regular practice. If you have not tried kundalini yoga you do not know what you are missing!!!!,1376092800,2,179,4.142857142857143
