4163965,4,B003P5NVK8,"This is a fun disc which brings to life some of the great strips.  The artwork isn't the greatest but remains true to the strip.  The color is good and the voicing is fine. Snoopy, thankfully, is not heard but gets to ""comment"" in print-balloons. I would welcome another volume.",1289174400,6,278,4.54
