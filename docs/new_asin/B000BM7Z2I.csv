8088745,1,B000BM7Z2I,"I have a shelf full of musical instruction DVDs, and this is absolutely the worst one I've ever purchased.  Usually I can pick up at least a couple of good tips from a DVD, but I went through this whole DVD last night and couldn't find any.

Don't be fooled by the marketing message - e.g. ""learn to play like Clapton, Chuck Berry, Keith Richards"".  The Clapton tip is to use the neck pickup; the Berry / Richards thing is a simple little boogie / blues progression that you probably learned your first week of playing guitar.

This DVD appears to be a compilation of other lessons; all of a sudden you're dropped in the middle of a lesson, and at least twice the different presenters say ""like we did before"".  Actually, we didn't do that before - at least not on this DVD.

The only remotely interesting piece for me (and this is a real stretch) was James Burton showing the ""Susie Q"" lick.  I've managed to live a long time without wanting to know that lick, but since it was there, I learned it.  Even here, though, the tab was wrong.  A big part of the lick is the thumb doing a constant quarter-note hit on the low E string; the tab didn't consistently show this hit happening, even though Burton was clearly playing it.

As far as having the tab show up on the screen while the lesson is playing - yeah, that'd be kinda neat if you could read it.  On my 55"" inch TV, it was basically illegible.

The best presenter of the six was probably David Grissom.  I think it'd be worth it to find the DVD that the segment on this DVD was pulled from.

The Lonnie Mack section was probably the worst, and the unnamed person interviewing him was not the least bit helpful.  I suppose in the longer version we would have found out who the interviewer was; in the segment on this DVD, we don't have a clue.  All we know is that he's not a particularly good guitarist, either on his rhythm playing or his soloing.

Don't waste your money on this.  Hal Leonard normally puts out really good material, but they failed miserably this time.",1326326400,3,2029,4.336870026525199
8088746,1,B000BM7Z2I,"Really a bad instructional video. A few minutes of each player, not really showing you anything no trademark licks. Just a bunch of smoke up yer arse. Don't buy it. Rent it if you have to.",1152144000,,188,4.25
8088747,2,B000BM7Z2I,"This DVD is only 41 minutes long, so you only get about 5 minutes with each artist, plus a 5 minute intro.  Video quality is ok, but looks like transfers from VHS.  I'm a beginner on the bass, but I've been playing guitar for over 10 years.  If you are a beginner at music theory, the Glenn Letsch snippet will be confusing (chord theory).  If you are a beginner bass player, you might pick up a couple of semi-interesting exercises and techniques.

If I'd been expecting it to be only 40 minutes long, I would have given it 3 stars.",1150761600,2,533,4.29
