8688070,5,B00PI97S7Q,Really strong acting from the main cast.  There were a few holes in the plot but nothing that really takes away from the entirety of the film.  Abstraction keeps you guessing the whole time with the twists and turns.  I paid full price to see it but at $2.99 it's a no brainer.,1452124800,2,277,4.188679245283019

8688074,4,B00PI97S7Q,"I checked out this film at the New Beverly Cinema in LA last year. Really well written, directed and shot. Well acted for the most part... except for the minor walk-on roles. :/ Production value was totally high compared to other low-budget indie films such as this. Definitely worth a watch. Story kept me guessing until the very end.",1422316800,,335,4.694915254237288
