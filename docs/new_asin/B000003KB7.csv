7903051,5,B000003KB7,"When Janeway and Paris take off on an away mission, Chakotay, Torres, and the rest of Maquis take over ""Voyager.""  It seems they are fed up with the ship taking its time to get through the Delta Quadrant by constantly stopping to help in the name of the Federation's glorious principles.  Just as things are getting really interesting, Paris walks in and asks Torres what she is up to.  By way of a response she freezes the program: it is all a holodeck novel.
""Star Trek: Voyager,"" Episode 67, ""Worst Case Scenario"" (Written by Kenneth Biller, Aired May 7, 1997) combines the idea of the holodeck with computer games.  However, there is another twist to this tale, because the identity of the author of this holo-novel is unknown, and this raises some interesting questions.  Is this program just fun and games or is it something more subversive?  The holo-novel becomes the talk of the ship and an addicted Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) keeps playing around with different scenarios in the game with various plot twists to see how the mutiny plays out.  Eventually he discovers the author of the holo-novel and the reason it was created.  But then the pair discovers that there is something in the holo-novel that not even the author knew about.
I could probably take this synopsis a bit further, but this one is too much fun to give away too much.  ""Worst Case Scenario"" might not be a classic ""Voyager"" episode, but it is still a great episode, mainly because it comes up with a good idea and then throws on some more good ideas on top of the first one.  If you get one good twist in a ""Star Trek"" episode, you are doing okay, and this one has three such twists, which is pretty hard to beat.  Granted, the ending might not be as strong as the rest of the episode, but it is pretty hard to top the multi-level set up.  Which, appropriately, is the way things work out with most video games.",1068163200,,1894,4.521994134897361
