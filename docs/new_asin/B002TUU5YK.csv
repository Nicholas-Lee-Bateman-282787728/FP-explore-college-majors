8380706,5,B002TUU5YK,"This is a really good introduction to Ayurveda.. I recommend it for people who are new to Ayurveda and experienced practioceners as well. Its very entertaining and covers some history of Ayurveda, the basic principles, examples of treatment, success stories.. and talks about western medicine and how western doctors are starting to appreciate the ancient teachings of Ayurveda..

Two thumbs up!!",1332979200,6,396,5.491803278688525
8380707,5,B002TUU5YK,"Beautiful documentary. A very well done introduction to Ayurveda. I truly enjoyed every minute of it, from the script, to the sound, great photography and camera too. This is for sure Ayurveda movie I added to my collection.(beside ""Ayurveda- the Art of Being"", also, a must see).",1283040000,8,280,4.9787234042553195
