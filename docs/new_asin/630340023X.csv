I'd also add laurel n hardy sketch hosted by Alice!!! Mickey mouse steals da show. I hate when idiots make 39 eps instead of 40 eps!",1340841600,,295,4.481481481481482
7845569,5,630340023X,"IT WAS SUCH BEAUTIFUL ENDING, FINALLY RALPH & NORTON SUCCEED IN SOMETHING GOOD, MEMORABLE; ""MY LOVE SONG TO YOU"" IS IMMORTAL BY BOB MANNING! I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY 39 EPISODES WAS WAY OF DOING TV SHOWS, SAME GOES WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES, IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE NORM SHOULD BE 40, IT LOOKS BETTER, THERE ARE MORE SHOWS, ROUND NUMBER! HARD TO SAY WHICH ONE WOULD BE HM 40 BUT 99 YEAR LEASE, MY FAIR LANDLORD IS OK, IT WAS THE LAST 3 REEL SHOW WITH ORIGINAL CAST ANYWAY!  ACTUALLY SHOW SHOULD BE CALLED HONEYMOONERS 36 BECAUSE LAST 3 SHOWS WERE FILMED DURING 1957 JACKIE GLEASON SHOW. BENSEN. BOMBER SHOULD HAVE BEEN LAST, ALICE & THE BLONDE IS NOT2GOOD. INVITE REAL-LIFE BOXING CHAMP ARCHIE, FLOYD OR ROCKY, HAVE RALPH KNOCK HIM OUT, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MEMORABLE BLAST, PERFECT CODA!",1271721600,,782,4.666666666666667
