8240587,5,B00115KEL8,"I have been studying about Kibera for about 2 years, and was able to go there in July, 2008.  This video beautifully captures not only the visual Kibera, but also the need for compassionate action to help meet the hopes of its children.  I have shared this video with people young and old as a tool to help them understand what it means to have little but hope.",1240876800,,361,4.294117647058823
8240588,5,B00115KEL8,"""I Want To Be A Pilot"" is an incredible film and work of art, which deserves all of the awards it has already received.  When we look at our world today; often cruel and filled with extreme suffering, this exquisite film helps point the way.  The director and writer, Diego Quemada-Diez delivers an exceptionally moving and poetic vision. The viewer is swept up in the moment as the camera follows Omondi through the slums of Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya.  Poignantly, we hear the child's voice, clear and honest as he speaks the words of a poem, which narrates his world for us. A stark and almost unbearable reality is juxtaposed with the child's resilent dream of hope and possibility.  The choice of music is brillant as the words of ""Sweet Honey in The Rock"" hauntingly inspires us, ""...by your life be you spirit; by your heart be you woman; by your eyes be you open...""  ""I Want To Be A Pilot"" is more than a superb work of art and filmmaking.  It is an inspiration.  It will speak to you through it's beauty, artistry and the dignity of the human spirit it conveys.  Ultimately, it offers us a chance to respond.  As it presents a picture of the many faces of our humanity, it does so with a gentle and captivating touch.  This is a film which has the potential to heal.",1199318400,11,1274,4.452586206896552
