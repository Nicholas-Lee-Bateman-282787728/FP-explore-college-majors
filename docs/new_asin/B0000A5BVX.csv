Especially good is how he considers being approached from the rear as a Threat and how he treats all unexpected grabs etc from behind as a maximum threat.

They are geared for law enforcement and security officers, although bouncers would probably find this useful as well.  The material is well presented and illustrated. A good basic program for techniques that will keep you safe while you effect an arrest.",1335225600,2,321,5.2745098039215685
7996286,5,B0000A5BVX,"In this film, C.J. Caracci teaches some good hand to hand combat techniques useful for police officers. He gives a very compete instruction on every technique, and explains what details are important in succesfully employing the techniques. Caracci also shows counter moves to some of the techniques, which helps you pay attention to the important details.
The techniques shown are very simple to learn. I do not have much experience on martial arts, but still I had no difficulties on learning the techniques. And as a police officer, I have had a chance of testing some of the techniques in real life situations, and in my experience they work very well.
Caracci teaches also some little tricks you can use with other techniques than those instructed here. So, even if your departmental policy demands you to use different tehniques than in the film, you can still benefit from those tricks.
