531311,5,6302990130,"I can think of only a few movies that combine this much drama, suspense, comedy, superb acting, and images with such phenomenal results! Ustinov is over the top in his role as the famous Belgian detective! Not only does he show his sharpness and intelligence, but he also shows his comical and witty side well. The solution to the mystery is well hidden and concealed, but YET there are subtle things that an intelligent observer can catch on to. I do not want to ruin the solution for those of you who have not seen it. But I will say that almost never before, have I seen such a well developed and diverse group of suspects. This is not a typical dark and scarey mystery, but that in no way whatsoever hampers this phenomenal masterpiece!",973814400,,740,4.488888888888889
531312,5,6302990130,"Having seen all the Peter Ustinov/Hercule Poirot films, I find something worthwhile about each and every one.  The use of Cole Porter's timeless music, the Meditteranean locations, Sylvia Miles, Diana Rigg, Roddy  McDowall, and James Mason, and a script chocked full of vicious barbs  between the characters makes this a great time at the movies.
Jane  Birkin's Liza Doolittle-like transformation  near the film's end is a  stunner!",959904000,2,432,5.373134328358209
531313,4,6302990130,"The first Agatha movie i saw was Death on the Nile with Ustinov. For me who never liked Agatha's work that movie was a challenge,the end a total surprise and it had me seeing it again and again. I tried to saw another  Poirot in the Orient Express but i could not. Now about Evil under the sun,i  do not know if it is the plot or the direction that spoils the  excellence. The music and location are marvelous so is the cast and Ustinov  as Poirot,but there is something small lucking the top level as i said. I  guess you should see to judge,i believe you should once at least to judge  on your own!",957744000,,600,4.129310344827586
531314,4,6302990130,"This is one of my favorite movies, and I agree with the previous reviewers, but, nobody mentioned the wonderful Cole Porter music and the terrific costumes of the era worn by the cast.  I also enjoy the dialogs  between Diana Rigg and Maggie Smith and also between James Mason and Sylvia  Miles.",954979200,2,295,4.634615384615385
531315,2,6302990130,"I am a huge Agatha Christie fan, so this film was adisappointment for me. Overall the set-up and actors were okay, but Iwas very turned off by the performance of Peter Ustinov. Anyone who knows the character of Hercule Poirot knows that he wouldn't be caught dead hamming it up and spouting bad French the way Ustinov portrayed him! Christie's Poirot was extremely vain about his appearance and even dyed his hair! Ustinov takes away all the character's suave, quiet dignity and turns him into a bloated clown. This could have been an okay murder-whodunnit, but Ustinov really ruined it for me. David Suchet really IS Poirot, and it's a shame he wasn't discovered before this movie was filmed!  END",952560000,7,698,4.816666666666666
531316,4,6302990130,"Although not as good as the two previous movie adaptions, and considering it is almost faithless to Agatha Christie's great novel, EVIL UNDER THE SUN is good fun. Murder visits a tiny island resort and motives abound. Peter  Ustinov returns as Hercule Poirot, although he seems a little less serious  this time around. All-star cast includes Maggie Smith, Diana Rigg, Roddy  McDowell, Jane Birken, and James Mason. Worth a look. Look for Maggie Smith  and Diana Rigg's sparring. It's priceless.",946166400,12,494,5.1375

531378,4,6302990130,"At first, I confused this title, murder at a resort of a philandering wife involving a philandering husband and mousy wife at the same resort, with another Agatha Christie novel, the one that takes place on Rhodes. However, when I saw the opening scene regarding the murder of Alice Robard, I realized that I had mixed up the two slightly similar resort plots. It did not help that the screen play of this movie moved the island from off the coast of England to a fictitious island in the Mediterranean Sea. (It was actually filmed in Mallorca which I would love to visit some day.)

I prefer David Suchet's acting (done with dignity) of the Christie books to Peter Ustinov's acting, which is somewhat over the top and played comically. However, I enjoyed seeing Diana Rigg, Maggie Smith, and Roddy McDowell in this movie version of Evil Under the Sun.

I thought it was interesting that the costuming in this movie version, which undoubtedly had more generous funding, was not as well done as the costuming in the made for TV adaptions of Christie's books. There was a distinctive fabric that was reused for costumes worn by three different female characters in this movie. Tsk, Tsk. Shame on the person doing the costumes.

I enjoyed it, but the flaws I mentioned made it less enjoyable than the British TV versions of Christie's books. So I give it 4 stars compared to the TV versions which are all definitely 5 stars.",1523232000,,1421,4.676
531379,5,6302990130,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film with some of my favorite actors from back in the day.  Peter Ustinov revives his Poirot from Death on the Nile while Maggie Smith portrays a strikingly different character and does it beautifully.  I liked everything about this movie, in fact, except for the murder itself.  Since the why of it was perfectly reasonable, I'll let that slide.  Overall, an excellent movie in an idyllic setting.",1522972800,,424,4.929577464788732
531380,3,6302990130,"This was my third attempt with the character, and same concept - lots of possible killers, just a different setting. This one was the weaker of the three. The solution was not really supported by all the facts, and the hero had information he did not bother to share with the audience until he made his announcement.",1522022400,,316,4.56140350877193

531382,1,6302990130,"The claimed author is Agatha Christie, but it is inconceivable that any writer, any writer at all, participated in this farrago. Quite simply, there is no plot. A gang of famous actors in bizarre costumes and overacting to a degree that would flunk them out of any acting studio go through the motions in an exotic hotel. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, made worse by the fame of the stars which kept us watching to the end when we should have turned it off at the beginning. The ending - don't worry, no spoilers, more's the pity - is utterly implausible. Finally, I have lived in France and Belgium, and the makers of this film owe both countries an apology for Ustinov who makes Peter Sellers sound like Moliere.",1521590400,,733,4.437037037037037

531384,5,6302990130,"Ustinov was my first exposure to H. Poirot. He does a good job and th cinematogaphy is stuning. David Suchet has spoiled me, I think oh him,not Ustinov, as THE quintessentiall Poirot. Just like Joan Hickson is the quintessential Miss Marple. Good movie regardless.",1520294400,,264,5.0227272727272725
531418,5,6302990130,"Something about this movie I can't get enough of... the Mediterranean setting, the Cole Porter score (!) and the costumes by Oscar winner Anthony Powell (Death on the Nile) give this movie serious juice!  Its mysterious, but also smart and catty - and how could it not be with Diana Rigg, Roddy McDowell and Maggie Smith - all of them 'carrying on' and dressed to kill in show-stopping 1930s glamour-wear.  Those 3 actors alone make it worth watching.  In the end, I think its success is really due to Guy Hamilton's direction (007 Goldfinger) and Peter Ustinov's Poirot.",1520294400,,571,4.8061224489795915

531481,5,6302990130,"I love this film.  Completely entertaining, wonderful performances by a wonderful cast, funny but with a serious backbone, absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Yes, Suchet is the prototype Poirot but Ustinov is great and a lot of fun.

One interesting thing is about the DVD print.  A friend of mine has one copy that's too clear and sharp.  The color comes off as flat and dull.  Basically, you can see the character's warts (to use the term.)  I'll never forget such a clear view of Ustinov's double chins later in the movie.  I got my own DVD version (with the cover picture like the one here) and it's like I saw it when I was growing up.  Softer around the edges and much richer colors, like someone has applied cinematography makeup to it.  The movie is meant to be seen in this softer, richer print.  It gives the film that beautiful, almost dreamlike quality that fully brings out the beauty of the scenery.",1513468800,,911,4.52760736196319

531682,5,6302990130,"I just wrote a review for 'Death on the Nile' with Peter Ustinov and this review is going to mirror that one. The great Albert Finney was absolutely stellar as Poirot in 'Murder on the Orient Express'. When Peter Ustinov took over as Poirot in the 80's on the big screen, it was obvious to all, that these films were not of the same excellent quality of 'Express'. That doesn't mean that they aren't good in their own way. 'Evil Under the Sun' seems to have a smaller budget than even 'Death on the Nile', and in 'Nile' you could already see and feel the 'less than' quality of 'Express'. So...'Sun' is downright...hokey in places. Again...that doesn't mean it isn't a whole lot of fun to watch. I will always feel Ustinov's two early Poirot's are well done and have merit in their own right, because the actors are absolutely giving it their all. The scripts are entertaining as are the costumes, sets, etc. As I said about 'Nile', if you think of these two films as exceptionally well done t.v. movies, then you shouldn't be disappointed.",1483747200,3,1040,4.566844919786096

A great British murder mystery with the perfect (though sometimes hammy) British casting, this Agatha Christie story is well worth the buy and never gets old.  Maggie Smith as always turns in a fantastically wry performance, enough to upstage the ageless beauty and former Emma Peale, Diana Rigg.  With his tongue-in-cheek turn on the stuffy little Belgian detective, Peter Ustinov is in my opinion the best Hercule Poirot ever.  Other cast members not to be dismissed are the wonderful Roddy McDowell, James Mason, Sylvia Miles and Colin Blakely.  And with tunes provided by the great Cole Porter, what's not to like about Evil Under the Sun?",1436486400,4,769,4.9765625

And Cole Porter's wonderful music to comment on the goings on. What could be better? I took a chance on this blu-ray, since it is multi-region. It played beautifully and I was not disappointed.

He's still my favorite Poirot.

Here's also a much younger version of Maggie Smith from the Hogwarts school of witchcraft or Downton Abbey, or countless other enjoyable features.  I've loved seeing her since childhood as well.  And Dianna Riggs pulls off another great performance as the rather villainous murder victim in this show.  There's no shortage of motives as it turns out.",1417219200,,709,5.060344827586207

532395,4,6302990130,"The fourth in the series of Brabourne/ Goodwin produced adaptations of Christie that began with MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (1974).  This one, set on an island in the Mediterranean (actually filmed in Majorca) has Peter Ustinov in his second outing as Poirot investigating the murder of a self-interested actor (Diana Rigg), with a gang of suspects including hotel-keeper Maggie Smith, cuckolded husband Denis Quilley, camp journalist Roddy McDowall, theatrical producer James Mason and his domineering wife Sylvia Miles, and would-be gigolo Nicholas Clay and his mousy spouse Jane Birkin.  Anthony Shaffer's script gives plenty of opportunity for humorous sequences, especially the cat-fights between Smith and Rigg, and the scene where Poirot, clad in a bathing-dress, attempts to have a morning swim.  Whereas David Suchet in the television version tended to be low-key in his characterization, referring to his ""little gray cells"" and how they solved cases on more than one occasion, Ustinov turns in a flamboyant performance, full of little details: the sequence where he overhears Clay and Birkin arguing in their hotel room ends with a shot of Poirot twitching his mustache, as if he doesn't quite believe what they are saying (he is eventually proved right).  The score has rightly been praised: John Lanchbery's arrangements of Cole Porter standards are both florid yet particularly appropriate for the film's bourgeois ambiance: the characters' entire lives are dedicated to pleasure rather than work.  As Poirot observes, somewhat cynically, they resemble slabs of meat laid out in the sun to brown.  Guy Hamilton's direction is both slick and very clear: unusually for most Christie adaptations, EVIL UNDER THE SUN ties up every single strand of its complicated plot, leaving viewers without too many questions to ask as to whodunit and why.  Definitely one of the better versions of the great detective novelist's work, even if it departs quite significantly from the source-text.",1407974400,4,1994,5.371794871794871

532422,3,6302990130,"AGATHA CHRISTIE'S EVIL UNDER THE SUN, 1982.  In this 116 minute, full color, all-star  crime/drama/mystery, Christie's famed Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is called in to investigate an important diamond that was purchased for wealthy arrogant actress Arlena Marshall.  Unfortunately, she turns up dead while on honeymoon with her new husband and stepdaughter at an exclusive tropical island resort hotel. Turns out Arlena had made many enemies, and as Poirot heads to the island paradise to sort through the long list of suspects, he finds that even among the rich and famous, murder never takes a holiday.  It looks like a perfect crime: all the suspects have alibis; and it has certainly ruined what might have been a perfect vacation for Poirot, and the hotel's other residents.

The star-laden cast is headed by Peter Ustinov, (DEATH ON THE NILE) as Poirot, with James Mason, (LOLITA, A STAR IS BORN) as Odell Gardener, theatrical producer whose finances have been devastated by Arlena's deciding to marry rich and leave the theater.  Sylvia Miles plays Myra Gardener, Odell's unhappy wife.  Diana Rigg, (THE AVENGERS, THE PAINTED VEIL) is Arlena; Maggie Smith, (DOWNTON ABBEY, GOSFORD PARK) the hotelier Daphne Castle.  Roddy McDowell, (PLANET OF THE APES), is Rex Brewster, journalist on whose book about her Arlena has just put the kibosh.  Dennis Quilley is Kenneth Marshall, Arlena's new husband.  Colin Blakely is Sir Horace Blatt, who'd originally bought the diamond for Arlena before she threw him over.  Jane Birkin, now possibly better known as an expensive status handbag than an actress, is Christine Redfern, a shy woman with whose handsome new husband Patrick, Arlena is already playing footsie.

The clever script of the film, which received theatrical release, was adapted from the book by well-known playwright/screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, directed by the talented Scot Guy Hamilton, who brought so much wit to the early 007 movies of his compatriot  Sean Connery.  The wide screen picture gives us the sparkling Mediterranean  at its best--it was filmed in Mallorca, the Balearic Islands, Spain. The all Cole Porter score sparkles too.  And the over-the-top women's costumes were by Anthony Powell.  In Rigg and Smith, the film boasts two such winning superstars that I thought each could have played the other's part, and tried imagining this change in casting as the film proceeded.  It is said, however, that the estate of Agatha Christie did not care for Ustinov's performance as her legendary private detective.  I was interested in comparing this version of the underlying book with David Suchet's, for television.  Of course, no television movie, no matter how lavishly made, can boast such a heavy all-star cast, such script writing and direction as this film received in its making, the expense of buying the Cole Porter songbook, or the expense of prolonged onsite filmmaking.  Still, I must say that, although I enjoyed this popular film in its theatrical release, I do find I prefer Suchet's little Belgian.  But certainly, this is fun viewing.",1406764800,,3080,5.204868154158215

532444,2,6302990130,"It never fails to amaze me that so many people will give a 5 star rating to what is at best a ho-hum film.  As a long time Christie fan who has read every one of her novels at least twice, I have to say that there has never really been a great film production of any of her books and that includes the Suchet teleplays.  The closest one was perhaps Murder on the Orient Express and despite excellent attention to sets and costumes, even that production had flaws.  The biggest problem is usually the inability of screen writers and actors (even actors who are otherwise phenomenal such as Finney and Ustinov) to capture the essence of Hercule Poirot.  Most productions exaggerate the quixotic character traits Christie incorporated into her iconic sleuth and end up playing him for laughs or as a bit of a buffoon, but fail to capture the brilliance of his mind which should be evident throughout instead of just at the denouement.  Plus, Ustinov was just simply too large of a man to represent Poirot who was always portrayed as a small, slight, and very finicky man, who for instance would never appear in a bathing costume.  Other than that, this production was generally faithful to the plot points in the novel despite several, minor, unnecessary points where it strayed and some of the other actors, who, though they played their roles fine didn't really fit the part - for instance, Diana Rigg was, I'm afraid too old at the time of filming to appropriately represent Arlena.  And the costumes were off putting - they were largely over the top for both male and female characters.  To me the costume designer/director apparently wasn't sure what era the story was supposed to be set in and so incorporated various clothing designs ranging from the 1910's through the 40's and thereby failed to create a coherent reference point in time.  Plus, they made Maggie Smith's character look like a silly floosy who perhaps should have been running a brothel rather than a posh seaside resort.  All in all, I did sort of like the camp quality of the film, but like most other adaptations of Christie stories, it falls far short of the book.",1400284800,,2139,4.664893617021277

The film version of Agatha Christie's Evil Under the Sun, staring Peter Ustinov as Christie's favorite detective Hercule Poirot, was released in 1982. Anthony Schaffer wrote the screenplay, Guy Hamilton was the Director, Cole Porter wrote the music and Anthony Powell designed the magnificent modernistic campy costumes.

As the story opens a hiker, Alice Ruber, is found strangled on the Yorkshire moors. Poirot was hired by the insurers to investigate the murder and added the investigation of a faux diamond being substituted for the genuine one belonging to millionaire industrialist Horace Blatt (Colin Blakely). Poirot interviewed Horace Blatt on his yacht who said that he given the diamond, valued at $50,000, to a New York City music show star, Arlina Stuart, (Diana Rigg), in contemplation of marriage. She had left him on the boat trip back to England and married Kenneth Marshal; he demanded the diamond back. Now he knows that she returned a faux copy of the diamond to him.

The participants all gathered at an exclusive island resort in the Adriatic, formally the summer palace of the King of Tyrania and now owned by Daphne Castle (Maggie Smith). Resort guests included: Odell and Myra Gardener (James Mason and Sylvia Miles), New York City theatrical producers, and Rex Brewster (Roddy McDowall) a writer and theatrical journalist. Newly arriving guests included: Kenneth Marshal (Denis Quilley), his wife Arlina and his 16 year old daughter Linda; Patrick Redfern, a dashing young man and his wife Christine (Nicholas Mason and Jane Birkin); and of course Hercule Poirot .
Odel and Myra Gardner face financial ruin resulting from Arlina quitting their successful musical in the middle of its run, and her refusal to accept a role in their newly planned musical. Rex Brewster faces serious debts due to having spent advances on the book he had written about Arlina. She refused to let him publish it. Horace Blatt will loose $50,000 on the diamond he had given to Arlina, unless he can get her to return the genuine one to him.

Arlina is found strangled on the beach near the faux diamond. Daphne Castle urges Poirot to investigate fearing a spot of murder would ruin her resort hotel. Poirot accepts planning to get a recovery fee on the diamond. As is often the case in Christie's mysteries, a lot of the participants have motives but their alibis seem to preclude the possibility that any of them committed the crime. Poirot questions all of the suspects several times. He uses his little grey cells to evaluate and organize the responses into a timed matrix. The next day, he awakens refreshed, and asks that they all gather in the lobby after he has had breakfast; then he will tell them how the crime was committed and who the guilty party was.

Can you solve this crime before Poirot finishes breakfast? I strongly recommend that you save your sanity, buy the DVD, and tell your family to join you with popcorn in hand to see the movie. You can watch it over and over until your little grey cells organize the information into a timed matrix. Then you can compare your solution with Poirot's. Incidentally if you also have a copy of this same mystery with David Suchet playing Poirot you can compare the two of them. You will find that disc in the ""Definitive Collection"" of twelve Agatha Christie mysteries. I believe you will find this version with Peter Ustinov playing Poirot to be far superior; I certainly do.",1390262400,,3450,4.882252559726963

All of this is highlighted by John Lanchbery's arrangement of Cole Porter music, some of it well known and other sections from obscure, long forgotten sources, but is exactly in the right period style to heighten the atmosphere.

532702,2,6302990130,"SPOILER ALERT

I love Christie's books.  I really think she's one of the best authors of all time, having almost single-handedly created an entire genre on her own.  I've read Christie mysteries that while not great, certainly had great moments in them.  They had some redeeming quality.  Not this one.

Christie is normally excellent at her setups.  Everything is presented for a later pay off.  The reader/viewer usually hits their forehead and says, ""Why didn't I notice that earlier?!""  Not here.  There was absolutely NO evidence or reason to connect some random murder, shown at the opening of the film, to the Redferns.  In fact, I kept thinking through the whole film that this particular scene was just included to introduce Poirot to the audience...to show him sleuthing.  How she ties the Redferns to this earlier murder just to establish proof of their murder of the main victim is WAY too convenient.  Poirot just happens to find the jewel in the pipe of the murderer as he tries to sneak it out of the hotel.  How preposterous was THAT?!  Why in his pipe instead of his pocket?  Totally random.  How could Poirot possibly have known?  NO clues are given to the audience about this and a lot of things along the way.  I felt Christie painted herself into a corner with this one and had to cheat her way out.  It's a shame because she always plays fair with her audience.  Forget this lame story on DVD or in book form and choose:  And Then There Were None, Toward Zero or Crooked House or Ordeal By Innocence for excellent mysteries with ALL the clues intact.  In fact, all of those books are among Christie's personal favorites.  I can see why.  They're perfectly constructed.  Evil Under the Sun however, is on par with her worst book ever...Endless Night.  Don't bother with either of them.

FYI:  As a rule, Christie's books do NOT play out well on film.  Her mysteries are like puzzles, psychological games.  There is a LOT of talking, clue collecting and back-and-forth among suspects.  This is great for books, but NOT film, which can feel VERY static and boring.  Film is a visual medium that needs to SHOW what's going on and NOT TELL the audience.  Since her books are very talky, they tend to not make great films.  Choose the books, instead.  The experience is completely different.",1364688000,,2307,4.694235588972431

Peter Ustinove takes over the role of Hercule Poirot, private detective extrodinaire, from Albert Finney (""Murder On The Orient Express"") and is more an impersonation than a well acted character but who cares? He's filled with Gallic...sorry, Belgian charm. And what a cast for him to investigate! Maggie Smith, Diana Rigg, James Mason, Sylvia Miles, Roddy McDowell, Denis Quilley, and on and on. No one bothered to write a score for this; Why would they when there's Cole Porter around? His ageless tunes wind through this providing everything from a lounge performance to the appropriate musical stings where needed. John Lanchbery has them arranged to be lush, vaguely decadent and very listenable. Clever, if not witty, dialogue, terrific settings, faux thirties costuming that needs this sort of star power to not get in the way and every production value availble make it a happy homicide with the guilty punished, the heroes rewarded and a happy ending for everyone. In short, the sort of film that one suspects the actors had a grand time making. Scenery is chewed, parts are over acted and a good times is had by all. Including the viewer, certainly this one. Alas, it's the sort of spectacle that isn't made today unless CGI effects get the starring role. Even if you've watched it ten times, it's still a comfort to watch just for the fun to be had.

532803,1,6302990130,"How can a film by a major studio containing such an array of first class actors be a bomb?  Well, it happened here...in spades.  It must be that the cast and crew wanted a holiday in Spain and so agreed to be in this ridiculous Agatha Christie story.  The acting is almost tongue in cheek; you can't believe, for example, how awful Roddy McDowall can be as a gay and how ridiculous Diana Rigg is as the bitchy victim.  (The costumes, all around, are grotesque, especially on Rigg and Maggie Smith.)  If we hadn't seen David Suchet in the role of Poirot, we might have given a pass to Peter Ustinov.  But alas, he is a parody of the character we all know and love.  The pair of actors playing the villains have skills akin to what one might see in a high school play.  James Mason, 73, is barely in the film but gets star billing.  His crude hair dye is somehow appropriate.

Good photography is all this stinker has going for it.  I hope the participants had a good time on location.  For the rest of us, the final product is only yet another occasion to groan aloud.

This is my favourite Agatha Christie movie, the other being Death On The Nile.  Both are quite similar. A glamorous bitch steps on everyone's toes and gets killed. Everyone has motives and alibis, so Hecule Poirot has to use his little grey cells to fish out the real murderer(s).

The film demonstrates in great visual detail how the murder is carried out. As with Death On The Nile, you would never have guessed in a million years the actual situation.

The cocktail parties are the best scenes as it's where daggers start to fly. I could not help laughing at how mean and rude some of the characters are. I was absolutely delighted when Arlena and Dapnne competed to sing You're The Top - a blatant Cole Porter ode to homosexual relations.

There's also a scene where Myra Gardener tells her husband off for failing to convince Arlena to do the show. ""If you were a man I would divorce you!"" So is she in a marriage of convenience with a gay man? It was never explained.

Evil Under The Sun also features lots of fabulous costumes and an exotic locale. The novel is set in Devon while the film is based on an Adriatic island. As with most films, there are rewrites. I'll leave you to read the book and make your own comparisons. The actual location filming took place in Spain, a lovely spot for a holiday!

The only downer was the sound and picture quality which wasn't as loud and sharp as I wished.

Other than that, Evil Under The Sun is a brilliant video you'll watch over and over. Each time is as good as the first!",1332633600,,1757,4.4858934169279
532875,2,6302990130,"Agatha Christie's novels had usually been filmed with a mixture of ho-hum and broad comedy and lots of tinkering with the plots, facts that annoyed Christie to no end. She resisted selling further film rights until the 1974 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, which set a new standard for glamour, memorable performances by an all star cast, and remarkable faithfulness to the original novel. But when producers wished to pursue other Christie project, the star at the center ORIENT EXPRESS--Albert Finney--declined, and Peter Ustinov was signed in his place. The result was once more a mixture of ho-hum and broad comedy and lots of tinkering with the plots.

Even under the best of circumstances EVIL UNDER THE SUN would be a difficult book to film because so much of plot hinges on a meticulous time line; the result is an extremely wordy script that has undergone some sea changes to make the whole thing less demanding for those who don't want to be forced into paying attention to detail. The characters have also undergone a series of changes that one would not expect. Even so, the basic notion remains the same. Arlena Marshal (a role said to have been loosely based on stage star Gertrude Lawrence and played to perfection by Diana Rigg) is a hard-as-nails stage star, recently married, who comes to an island resort for a vaction. She becomes infatuated with a young man, which infuriates her husband and his wife; she ticks off a couple of producers who are seeking her services for a new show; she rips up a biographer when she refuses to sign a release for the book he has written about her. Indeed, just about everyone has cause to hate her--so it is no great surprise when Arlena turns up dead on an isolated beach. But when Poriot begins to sort through the alibis, he discovers that absolutely no one seems to have had the opportunity to kill her.

Some of the performances are quite nice: Diana Rigg plays a memorable bitch and Maggie Smith is quite good as her former rival and the resort owner. But the script is extremely weak, the whole thing is filmed in a ho-hum manner, and such guest stars as Roddy McDowell, Silvia Miles, and James Mason are largely wasted. And then there is Peter Ustinov as Poirot, who is utterly unlike the character Agatha Christie created and who plays the role as more buffoon than celebrated detective. Indeed, Rigg and Smith aside, the best that can be said for the movie is the Cole Porter score, which is evocative of the period and well orchestrated. If you like the Ustinov Poirot, you'll probably enjoy this one--but if your tastes run to Albert Finney or the more recent David Suchet, you'll probably find the movie an uphill effort all the way. The DVD includes a short ""making of"" film and various cast bios.

A superb cast--led by the incomparable Peter Ustinov---and a gorgeous setting, plus terrific costumes, will give you plenty to enjoy, even if you're not particularly interested in solving the mystery of the murder.  The murder, which may have been treated more seriously in the book, seems really like a pretext here for making a stylish, fun movie.

For my money, Ustinov's performance alone is worth the price of admission.  He is so immensely funny and charming and sweet, that you will fall in love with him way before the end of the film.  All the others are first rate.  I particularly enjoyed Sylvia Miles as a terribly over-dressed, over-tanned, loud wife of a Broadway producer.  Also, Jane Birkin was quite stunning in the role of the ""pathetic"" wife.  Diana Rigg, Maggie Smith, James Mason, all first rate actors lend their considerable talents to prop up a silly plot.

The star-studded cast (Maggie Smith, Diana Rigg, James Mason, Roddy McDowall et al.) seem to be having the time of their lives.  Anthony Shaffer's script sparkles, the sets and costumes are splendid, and John Lanchbery's gorgeous arrangements of Cole Porter classics divert at these few points when the action slows.  The movie, made in 1981, holds up well; even if you know whodunit and how, there are set pieces and witty ripostes throughout to keep you amused.

My only cavil is that the recap at the end, when Poirot reveals all, moves slowly, but that's characteristic of sleuth movies and there's probably no remedy.",1251331200,2,853,5.028368794326241
532933,5,6302990130,"Sure Evil Under The Sun strays rather far from the Agatha Christie novel that inspired it and yes there is plenty of catty dialogue and exchanges between some of the characters, but when all is said and done this is one fun and ultimately satisfying movie that manages to entertain from the moment those watercolors paintings of an exotic island pop on the screen accompanied by a lush arrangement of Cole Porter tunes.  No doubt a few will object to murder being given so flippant a treatment but if you love your humor a little on the dark side, you'll chuckle along with all the ensuing mayhem as was, no doubt, the intention of both the screenwriter and director.  A few folks have used the word campy to describe certain aspects of the film but I disagree.  It's just plain fun.  Camp is often defined as ludicrously tragic and that's not what we have here.  The talent involved makes the viewer fully aware that it's no slip of judgment or taste that has lead to the film perpetually winking and smiling at its audience.  The comic vein was obviously deliberate. They seemingly want you to laugh and enjoy yourself as much as they seem to be.  Sylvia Miles dialogue is a perfect example of what I mean.  The costumes are major players but they're also period appropriate.  Roddy MacDowall's flamboyant Rex Brewster is a fantastic bit of nasty played just broadly enough that you almost feel bad for liking him.  Maggie Smith as the resort's proprietress is wonderfully delivered; her comic timing spot on and her exchanges with the deliciously wicked Arlene Marshall of Diana Rigg are the epitome of bitchy but always clever.  Evil Under The Sun doesn't want to be taken too seriously as a glum and grim murder mystery but rather aspires to be a more sophisticated sort of Noel Cowardesque romp that's inconveniently (and, yes, sadly) punctuated rather prematurely by murder.  But that said, the denouement is pretty terrific and equally plausible.  Few will see it coming.

532936,5,6302990130,"Probably the best of all the Hercule Poirot screen adaptations, and that's saying something because Suchet is really, really good.

I don't know what's wrong with the ""official"" reviewer.  There is nothing ""lazy"" about this screenplay.  The electric verbal sparring between Daphne Castle (Maggie Smith) and Arlena Marshall (Diana Rigg) can attest to that, as can the venomous wit of the Gardners towards the outlandish Rex, and the cutting and feisty attitude of Linda Marshal, who manages to be sympathetic despite a semi-serious attempt to get an innocent man hanged. The pace is somewhat slow, but the same could be said about several great movies.  The director decided to play up the gorgeous Cole Porter soundtrack and beautiful island setting, and far be it from me to begrudge him this very understandable artistic decision.  In retrospect, the viewer will find no dialogue to have been wasted and no scene to have been gratuitously overlong.

The ""camp"" criticism comes (I guess) from the somewhat over-the-top nature of the characterizations.  Diana Rigg is rather ostentatiously prissy throughout her short-lived part--as is Roddy McDowell for that matter.  Mr. Redfern is gratuitously ""beefy"" and Mr. Marshall is almost comically upright; hence we have the classic ""camp"" archetypes of the flamboyant homosexual, the hulking gigolo, the insufferable diva, and the staunch, unshakable ""square"" (who, in real camp films, is bound to end up in a thong).  The problem with this criticism is, of course, that despite their eccentricities, all of the characters wind up being believable except perhaps Arlena, and she does not get enough lines to become tiresome.  Her job is to establish why an entire island would want to kill her and she does so quite effectively.  Aside from Ustenov's Poirot, Maggie Smith's Daphne Castle is more genuinely likable and alive than any other character in the book or the various adaptations of all kinds thereof; and all of the other characters are very real and entertaining, while none tires in the least.

As for the plot being contrived and implausible, the entire mystery genre is a contrivance.  The common characteristic of all mysteries is that their plots, upon close scrutiny, are ridiculous.  The point is to finesse these contrivances so that the audience overlooks them and/or accepts them; and the devices used to justify the obviously incredible situation in which the characters end up are ingenious and effective (and a primary source of the movie's deviations from the book).  To complain of contrivance in a mystery is similar to complaining to a fantasy writer that dragons don't really exist.  The more relevant demands one must make of a mystery movie are that its solution must stand up to scrutiny (It does so seamlessly), it must be elegant and not forced or obvious (It is a masterful union of artistry and necessity), and the story itself must possess enough literary substance so that it could work even without the added aspect of the logic puzzle (and indeed, it loses nothing even after you know the answer).

In short, this is, IMO far better than the Suchet counterpart (which is closer to the book, except for the forced injections of Japp and Hastings).  It is probably better than any Suchet, and even better than the book, from which again, it does deviate considerably.",1228176000,,3349,5.069216757741348

Naturally someone(s) is unexplainably dispatched.  Of course the island is loaded with the usual suspects.  Everyone has a motive and an alibi.  By this time you have completely forgotten how the movie started.

Speaking about the movie, they pulled out all the stops with expensive locations, costumes, and actors.  And Cole Porter tossed in for ambiance.  There was even an appearance of Roddy McDowall who played Alan ""Mollymauk"" Musgrave in ""Lord Love A Duck"" (1966)

Yeah, you can't expect ""Evil Under the Sun,"" with its barbed Mediterranean atmosphere, to resemble Agatha Christie's usual cozies. This relaxed murder mystery does succeed at being fun and genuinely befuddling, although the martini-swilling, sunny atmosphere make the entire gruesome murder feel rather too... relaxing. A murder shouldn't seem like a vacation... or should it?

An insurance goof and a stolen gem send Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) to ""Daphne's Place,"" a palace-turned-hotel in a small Mediterranean country. He arrives on the same boat as famed stage actress Arlena Marshall (Diana Rigg) and her new husband and stepdaughter. Arlena openly has an affair with boytoy Patrick (Nicholas Clay) -- and then she suddenly turns up, strangled on a remote beach.

There are suspects galore: her betrayed husband, resentful stepdaughter, an old rival who is attracted to Mr. Marshall, a pair of ugly American producers whom she's bankrupting, a flaming gossip writer who has written a steamy tell-all, and her boytoy's mousy wife. But no one had the opportunity -- everyone has an alibi. So Hercule Poirot exercises the ""little gray cells,"" unravelling the clues of a discarded bottle, a midday shower, a cannon, and perfume in a cave.

Don't expect ""Evil Under the Sun"" to be any more faithful to its book than Arlena is to Marshall -- several aspects of the plot are rearranged or changed, and the sense of darkness is exchanged for a rhinestoned camp quality. And the plot unfolds at a leisurely pace, dropping in hints, clues and clever deceptions like so many plastic jewels on a beach.

In fact, the clothes say it all -- both Rigg and Maggie Smith wear faux jewels on silver lame, and American Myra resembles a Christmas tree with fur. Everyone swills martinis, sunbathes, and wanders across a lush little island to the hotel. Occasionally the impending murder and its aftereffects seem almost like an afterthought.

That said, ""Evil Under the Sun's"" campy quality is part of what makes it so much fun. Lots of catty, witty dialogue (""She always could throw her legs up in the air higher than the rest of us... and wider...""), sniping characters with plenty of motives, and a delightfully loathsome victim. You'll want Arlena dead by the time she tells her daughter to go play with the jellyfish, and then you'll want to know who could possibly have done the impossible.

Peter Ustinov has the right combination of smarts and comedy to play Poirot, the Belgian sleuth who saves the day and drives the hotel staff crazy. And while he succeeds in bringing Poirot's eccentricities to life (such as the ""swimming"" scene), he never takes it over the top to the point where Poirot becomes cartoonish.

The always-awesome Maggie Smith also turns in a wonderful performance as the razor-tongued ""maitresse en titre turned hotelier,"" turning in some touching and funny moments among the sharp dialogue. And Rigg is wonderfully catty, nasty, glamorous and utterly uncaring of anyone else. The supporting cast also does a wonderful job, particularly the two who play the murderers -- and are the last ones you'd expect.

The one flaw is that all the humor, glitz and wit detract a little from the dark atmosphere one expects from a murder mystery. Instead, ""Evil Under the Sun"" is a campy comedy that happens to have a murder in it.",1226620800,14,3450,4.986086956521739

Like ""Death on the Nile"" and most other Christie TV/film adaptations, on one level this is pretty by-the-numbers stuff: you get an eccentric cast of characters, a colorful locale, someone who everyone has a reason to hate and soon becomes a murder victim (here, a still dazzling Diana Rigg), and the eventual revelation of the murderer/murderers while all sit around and listen to Monsieur Poirot as he unspools the facts.

533119,4,6302990130,"I watched this DVD immediately after Death on the Nile (also by Peter Ustinov as Poirot) and am happy to declare that this one is even more intriguing.

The movie began with a seemingingly irrelevant unsolved murder of a woman in an obscure spot in England and saw Poirot moved on to an island resort in France to solve the mystery of a fake diamond. With a lesser cast than Death on the Nile, this movie made it up with the beautiful scenery - the unique island dotted with beautiful orchids, exotic plants and manicured gardens. Many a time the shots had a beautiful pot of flowers at the corner of the screen. The overall effect gave the movie such a modern feel as it resonated with the beautiful scenery as Pride and Prejudice, Match Point and Mrs. Henderson Presents.

Thanks to the reminder of another reviewer. The movie opened with some lovely water-color sketches and the movie was accompanied by the soothing and playful Cole Porter tunes - just the right mood for the holiday makers.

However there is more to the movie than an eye-pleasing cinematography. The movie had an attractive plot - a diva on stage whose nod could have pleased the other travellers on the island and whose incooperation gave everyone a good reason to hate her. Maggie Smith, her fellow dancer in the old days and now the owner of the island resort was most gorgeous, radiant and young looking here.

The fluid storytelling and breathtaking hike trails almost made me forget the opening murder which was brought to closure only at the end. And the last 5 minutes was simply a delight. For the murderer(s) revealed the true colors and dazzled the other people with a complete overhaul in the clothes and attitudes.

533123,3,6302990130,"A mysterious murder, unbreakable alibis, and a stolen diamond... all wrapped up in a glitzy, mildly campy shell.

Yeah, you can't expect ""Evil Under the Sun,"" with its barbed Mediterranean atmosphere, to resemble Agatha Christie's usual cozies. This relaxed murder mystery does succeed at being fun and genuinely befuddling, although the martini-swilling, sunny atmosphere make the entire gruesome murder feel rather too... relaxing. A murder shouldn't seem like a vacation... or should it?

An insurance goof and a stolen gem send Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) to ""Daphne's Place,"" a palace-turned-hotel in a small Mediterranean country. He arrives on the same boat as famed stage actress Arlena Marshall (Diana Rigg) and her new husband and stepdaughter. Arlena openly has an affair with boytoy Patrick (Nicholas Clay) -- and then she suddenly turns up, strangled on a remote beach.

There are suspects galore: her betrayed husband, resentful stepdaughter, an old rival who is attracted to Mr. Marshall, a pair of ugly American producers whom she's bankrupting, a flaming gossip writer who has written a steamy tell-all, and her boytoy's mousy wife. But no one had the opportunity -- everyone has an alibi. So Hercule Poirot exercises the ""little gray cells,"" unravelling the clues of a discarded bottle, a midday shower, a cannon, and perfume in a cave.

Don't expect ""Evil Under the Sun"" to be any more faithful to its book than Arlena is to Marshall -- several aspects of the plot are rearranged or changed, and the sense of darkness is exchanged for a rhinestoned camp quality. And the plot unfolds at a leisurely pace, dropping in hints, clues and clever deceptions like so many plastic jewels on a beach.

In fact, the clothes say it all -- both Rigg and Maggie Smith wear faux jewels on silver lame, and American Myra resembles a Christmas tree with fur. Everyone swills martinis, sunbathes, and wanders across a lush little island to the hotel. Occasionally the impending murder and its aftereffects seem almost like an afterthought.

That said, ""Evil Under the Sun's"" campy quality is part of what makes it so much fun. Lots of catty, witty dialogue (""She always could throw her legs up in the air higher than the rest of us... and wider...""), sniping characters with plenty of motives, and a delightfully loathsome victim. You'll want Arlena dead by the time she tells her daughter to go play with the jellyfish, and then you'll want to know who could possibly have done the impossible.

Peter Ustinov has the right combination of smarts and comedy to play Poirot, the Belgian sleuth who saves the day and drives the hotel staff crazy. And while he succeeds in bringing Poirot's eccentricities to life (such as the ""swimming"" scene), he never takes it over the top to the point where Poirot becomes cartoonish.

The always-awesome Maggie Smith also turns in a wonderful performance as the razor-tongued ""maitresse en titre turned hotelier,"" turning in some touching and funny moments among the sharp dialogue. And Rigg is wonderfully catty, nasty, glamorous and utterly uncaring of anyone else. The supporting cast also does a wonderful job, particularly the two who play the murderers -- and are the last ones you'd expect.

The one flaw is that all the humor, glitz and wit detract a little from the dark atmosphere one expects from a murder mystery. Instead, ""Evil Under the Sun"" is a campy comedy that happens to have a murder in it.",1118361600,5,3450,4.986086956521739

I watched this movie without reading the 1941 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it is based on.  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

As a brief synopsis, the movie begins with a death.  Then the movie shifts to a group of people arriving at ""Daphne's Island"" where they all stay at a posh hotel.  One of the guests staying at this hotel is none other than the super-sleuth himself, Hercule Poirot (Sir Peter Ustinov).  Eventually a hotel guest is murdered.  As Poirot investigates it seems that ""nobody did it.""

Who are the other guests and those associated with the hotel?  They are as follows:

1) Sir Horace Blatt, a wealthy industrialist (Colin Blakely)
2) Daphne Castle, owner of the hotel (Dame Maggie Smith)
3) Arlena Stuart Marshall, a famous stage actress (Dame Diana Rigg)
4) Captain Kenneth Marshall, Arlena's husband (Denis Quilley)
5) Linda Marshall, Kenneth's daughter (Emily Hone, her movie debut)
6) Christine Redfern, socialite? (Jane Birkin)
7) Patrick Redfern, Christine's husband (Nick Clay)
8) Rex Brewster, biographer (Roddy McDowall)
9) Odell Gardener, producer (James Mason)
10) Myra Gardener, Odell's wife and a producer (Sylvia Miles)

Near the end of the movie, Poirot lists the clues that were needed to solve the murder: ""a bathing cap, a bath, a bottle, a wristwatch, [a] diamond, a noon-day gun [or cannon], The Breath of the Sea, and [the] height of [a] cliff.""

Of all the actors above, Ustinov's performance stands out.  This was his second time playing Poirot and I feel he does a stellar job depicting the great Belgian.  Other performances to look for are Maggie Smith as the hotel owner and Diana Rigg as the famous actress.

The cinematography of this movie is visually stunning.  This movie was partly filmed on location in Majorca, Spain.  (Christie purists may not like this since in the novel the setting is the English coast.)  Some of the costumes are outrageous and over the top.  (Ustinov designed the bathing suit he wears in the movie.)  All music in the movie is by Cole Porter.

As Poirot is attempting to solve this crime, he looks in the hotel register.  Look for a famous name among these signatures.

Finally, the DVD has some extras.  Of these, I found the one about the making of this movie interesting.  It lasts for about fifteen minutes.

In conclusion, this movie has everything: wit, odd characters, a good mystery, beautiful settings, and an enthralling ending.  It is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

533202,5,6302990130,"Hercule Poirot ponders a troubling predicament in EVIL UNDER THE SUN. There is a murderer among them, they have a dead body that proves that, yet everyone who could have committed the murder has an alibi. How Poirot overcomes this obstacle and presents the details of the crime is a large part of the fun in this second of the Peter Ustinov star studded Poirot movies after the entertaining and successful DEATH ON THE NILE.

A big fan of the gorgeous Diana Rigg, I was excited to see her listed as one of the stars in this adaptation of the Agatha Christie book.

In fact it appears that my favorite actresses invariably end up being the corpse in these Ustinov Poirot movies. In DEATH ON THE NILE I was attracted to the title because Lois (MOONRAKER) Chiles played the key part of the murdered heiress.

Here, another former Bond girl Rigg plays a famous stage star who ends up as the victim of a plot that is so ingenious and amazing in both its complex nature and absolute simplicity.

The Christie novel was set on the Engliush coast but here the producers have wisely switched the setting to an island resort hotel in the Adriatic which is run by a former chorus girl Daphne Castle (played with some nice humor by Maggie Smith).

Arriving as a guest at the hotel is a former rival of Castle's Arlena Marshall (played by Rigg). As is the case with most Christie novels (and especially DEATH ON THE NILE and 1974's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS), the victim Marshall is surrounded by enemies at the resort. Apart from Smith's Castle they include Roddy McDowell as Rex Brewster who is devastated to learn that Marshall will not allow his biography of her to be published. Also guests at the hotel are theatrical producers Odell and Myrna Gardner (played by James Mason and Sylvia Miles) who hold a grudge against Marshall for walking out on a stage production they had produced. Colin Blakely plays Sir Horace Blatt who  made Marshall the offer of a diamond before being jilted by her. Also included in the cast is Nicholas Clay (as Marshall's lover Patrick Redfern) and Jane Birkin as his wife Christine Redfern. Also included is Denis Quilley (as Marshall's husband) and Emily Hone as her stepdaughter. The cast all play their parts perfectly, with equal dashes of humor and drama.

Found dead sunbathing on the beach is legendary actress Arlena Marshall, yet nobody seems to have had the opportunity to kill her. Belgian detective Hercule Poirot must unravel the truth and expose the red herrings to identify the murderer. Ustinov (as always) delivers a tour de force performance and Poirot and is (to my mind) the most consistently entertaining of all the actors to have played the part.

Another alumni of the James Bond series is Director Guy (GOLDFINGER) Hamilton who guides the movie through to its thrilling climax.

Included on the DVD is a vintage documentary on the `Making of EVIL UNDER THE SUN as well as theatrical trailers. The picture quality is good (nicely presented in widescreen) as is the Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono audio track.

Overall this movie is a lot of fun, and the mystery is involving and surprising - factors that make this movie especially entertaining towards the final scenes.

This movie is also available as part of a three-pack along with DEATH ON THE NILE and THE MIRROR CRACK'D or individually. Whichever option you choose this is a fine addition to anyones collection which I have no hesitation in recommending.",1091664000,5,3451,4.74457429048414

533205,4,6302990130,"Agatha Christie's murder mystery, 'Evil Under The Sun' is brought gloriously to life, in this movie from the early 80's. It features Peter Ustinov in his second showing as the legendary Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot along with a cast of actors who camp it up for all they are worth.
The plot follows the classic Christie template (see Death on the Nile, Murder on the Orient Express) of a group of people gathered together, with one being particularly nasty and unlikeable and (surprise, surprise!!) is murdered, with all of the remaining characters having a motive for putting this person out of the way. While this movie doesn't move too far away from the template, it rewards the viewer with an intriguing yet fun couple of hours.
The performances from all of the actors on board are excellent - yes they are over the top (especially Roddy McDowell's bitchy Rex Brewster and Sylvia Miles's droning Myra Gardener) but that makes them all the more endearing. Maggie Smith is obviously having loads of fun as the hotel proprieter, Daphne Castle, and her scenes with Ustinov have great energy. However Diana Rigg all but steals the film as the ""ageing"" actress, Arlena Marshall, a prize and completely ostentatious vamp. Ustinov is again on fine form as Poirot and relishes the chance to add his stamp to a character already memorably portrayed on screen by Albert Finney.
This film offers a great opportunity to actors out of their normal milieu (the aforementioned Smith and Rigg, as well as the luminous Jane Birkin) and is almost worth watching for that alone. Added to that is a great soundtrack of Cole Porter numbers which indelibly places this movie in the 1930's. While it does deviate from the setting and characters of Christie's source novel, that doesn't detract it from being an superb addition to the canon of Christie films.",1040342400,19,1843,4.891373801916933

533296,2,6302990130,"Evil Under the Sun is an unfortunately abysmal rendition of Agatha Christie's novel of the same name.  The very English environment and upper-middle class social milieu that Christie was so adept at creating has been mangled beyond recognition.  Instead of the English seaside, the action has been removed to an island in a laughably fictional kingdom somewhere in the Adriatic.  However, this does provide one of the few saving graces of the film - some absolutely stunning coastal scenery.

Peter Ustinov is a very passable Poirot (even if some of the things the director and screenwriter have got him doing are highly unlikely).  When an aging actress is murdered whilst on holiday, there are no shortage of suspects amongst the other guesthouse residents.  But all would appear to have cast iron alibis, so Belgian sleuth supreme Hercule Poirot must call on his ""little grey cells"" to distinguish fact from fiction.  The other characters are portrayed with a highly developed sense of camp, and indeed the film ends up feeling like a parody that doesn't quite manage to pull it off.  Watch however, for some fabulous verbal sparring between Maggie Smith and Diana Rigg.
It is only at the last, when Poirot is expounding his theory on the identity of the murderers that the movie regains some credibility.  Despite the awkwardly connected sub-plots concerning a missing jewel and a murder on the English moors, the loose ends are tied up, and the viewer shares the guests' indignation as it appears that the perpetrators of the crime are going to get away with it.  In conclusion, watch it if you must, but don't let it put you off seeing other (largely far superior) screen adaptations of Christie's stories.",1032739200,4,1712,4.954545454545454

The potential murderers are played by such recognizable stars as Maggie Smith, James Mason, Roddy McDowell, and Sylvia Miles.

Based on the Agatha Christie Hercule Poirot whodunit, it makes for an enjoyable 2 hours. ""Evil"" boasts a terrific cast, a witty script, lovely Majorca locations, a delightful Cole Porter score, and some of the funniest costumes seen on film. The suspense factor is practically nonexistent, but who cares? The story takes place at a resort isle in the Adriatic, run by ex-chorus girl Daphne Castle, played by Maggie Smith. One of the guests is Smith's old rival, Arlena Marshall, a bitchy, Gertrude Lawrenceish musical comedy stage star, played by the gorgeous, fabulous Diana Rigg (that's Dame Diana Rigg to you, nowadays). Arlena has made a lot of enemies, many of whom happen to be staying at the same resort. There's Odell and Myra Gardner, theatrical producers that Arlena left in the lurch when she left a show they had produced, due to ""health"" problems; Rex Brewster, a flamingly effeminate columnist whose biography of Arlena she will not allow him to publish; her stepdaughter Linda; Sir Horace Blatt, from whom she accepted a fabulous diamond and then jilted him; Daphne, who has carried a torch for Arlena's husband; and Christine Redfern, the plain-Jane wife of studly Patrick Redfern, with whom Arlena is having an affair. Arlena is found strangled to death on the beach, and it is up to Hercule Poirot to find out who the murderer is. The performances, as I said before, are a lot of fun. Roddy McDowell lets it ALL hang out, complete with Tallulah Bankhead voice, James Mason and Sylvia Miles are great as the bickering Gardners, Ms. Miles particularly hilarious as a shrill-voiced harpy (her voice could shatter glass). Maggie Smith, Peter Ustinov as Poirot, and Nicholas Clay and lovely Jane Birkin (so frumped-up in this film, you wouldn't know her), Colin Blakely, Denis Quilley, and Emily Hone as Arlena's stepdaughter round out this wonderful cast. The score, made up of well-known and not-so-well-known Cole Porter tunes, is a delight, and then there are the costumes! Anthony Powell, with a strong sense of camp, designed the outrageous, black, white, red, and navy blue costumes that are a homage to legendary MGM designer Adrian, known for his exaggerated silhouettes, oversized decorations, and stark contrasts. The direction, by Guy Hamilton, who also has the James Bond classic ""Goldfinger"" to his credit, is capable.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who has a good sense of ""camp""-it's like being at a catty, 2-hour-long cocktail party!",996710400,45,2696,5.017857142857143
533301,5,6302990130,"This Agatha Christie Jig-saw puzzle is really great fun! There is a wonderful, escapist holiday atmosphere, great acting ensemble, and Cole Porter's music is the icing on the cake. Taking place on a beautiful island, it is a classic ""things aren't what they seem"" who-dunnit. Yes, the plot relies on actions by innocent guests that could never have been planned for, making it almost impossible to guess what actually happened, but the ingenuity is still a delight. As any Agatha Christie mystery fan knows, don't try to read any deep social significance into it - that is not the film's intention.",989712000,2,598,4.930693069306931
533302,5,6302990130,"EVIL UNDER THE SUN contains perhaps the campiest dialogue and most over-the-top performances of the four sparkling, big budget adaptations of Agatha Christie mysteries (ORIENT EXPRESS, NILE, MIRROR, and this one) made by the same producers. Somehow, it all works better here with its exquisite locations, lyrical Cole Porter score, and knockout Anthony Powell costumes which are truly breathtaking.
As always in a Christie mystery, no one seems able to have done the crime (despite everyone having a viable motive), and it's up to Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov who plays with the part more than ever in his broadest interpretation of the role in five tries - two films and three made-for-TV movies) to sort things out. He does so in a beautifully played denouement at the film's conclusion which makes everything clear.
The new DVD release is to be treasured for its very saturated colors (the VHS tape seemed washed out and vaguely unfocused) and clear sound (though mono, it seemed wonderfully rich and full). It's a terrific addition to anyone's mystery library and remains my favorite of the Christie adaptations. (I would like to see MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPESS get a widescreen DVD release some day, however.)",983923200,77,1215,5.08
533303,2,6302990130,"Peter Ustinov's second performance as Hercule Poirot, producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin's third adaptation of a Christie novel, ""Evil Under the Sun"" is way too knowing for its own good. Instead of playing it straight, as in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" or, to a lesser extent ""Death on the Nile,"" here all concerned seem to be more interested in proving their superiority to the material than in making it into a decent film. Many of the people involved are genuinely talented, but none of them should feel comfortable with this level of condescension.
Once again we're in an enclosed situation (this time a luxury hotel on a small island) amongst the rich and famous as a murder occurs. Once again a group of well-known actors have fun doing little impersonations. Once again we follow Poirot as he sorts through the contradictory evidence to arrive at a solution to the crime. Unfortunately, instead of making the mystery interesting, the filmmakers keep winking at us and nudging us in the ribs with way too loud orchestrations of Cole Porter tunes and heavy handed double-takes from the actors. The film is so smugly certain of its cleverness, it never really gets around to proving it.
There are a few pleasures. The Majorca locations are stunning and several of the performances are amusing in themselves. James Mason is always good, and he succeeds here partly by underplaying against the harpies screaming around him. One of them is played by Diana Rigg in a rare movie appearance. Her cat fights with Maggie Smith should make everyone run for cover. More than the scenery is left in tatters after they withdraw their claws, however. Their shenanigans help to turn Christie's novel into a festival for drag queens.
Brittle, too self-conscious, ""Evil Under the Sun"" is moderately diverting, but increasingly tedious. The very last scene, in which the rich raise a glass of champagne in an ironic toast to the guilty, is downright ugly. It's as if the murderer's real crime is daring to mix with his social ""betters."" When immensely wealthy and successful filmmakers get this smug, it's time to call the police.",983404800,6,2130,4.935933147632312

7833656,4,6302990130,"This movie is almost impossible to describe.  Anything w/Peter Ustinov, anything at all is going to be top tier class, no question about that, and that is why I ordered it.  It is strange, is actually about costuming (a comedy truly focused on exotic fashion, in some cases quite funny) and the story line is probably very good, not my interest at all (""Who done it?"") and, I found it quite boring but not enough to shut it down.  In the end, I enjoyed the real Ustinov champion he was, then put it in to donate with a smile.  A decent relaxing video.",1524441600,,551,4.320388349514563
