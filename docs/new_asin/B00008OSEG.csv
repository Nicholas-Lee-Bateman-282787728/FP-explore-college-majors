NO boxing footage, get ESPN's 2 DVD set Ringside for that!",1246665600,,264,4.395833333333333
7986149,3,B00008OSEG,Although I'm a huge Mike Tyson fan.. this DVD turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. It was purely built as a PR tool to get people to *know* the real Mike and Tyson. I would not recommend buying this item since it really doesn't contain anything but very close up interviews... I don't know why the cameraman was so close to the folks being interviewed... in some cases you could even count the hair in their nose.,1120348800,6,420,4.2625
7986150,3,B00008OSEG,"When I opened the carboard box which contained this dvd I knew something was a bit fishy. The picture of Mike on the front has had his facial tattoo digitally inserted onto him and I know this for two reasons. The first one being obvious. If you scroll up and look at the picture that advertises this dvd you will see that his tattoo is not there. The second one is that the picture on the front (the angry looking one) was taken January 2002 at the Lewis vs Tyson press conference when Tyson lost the plot. He didn't get his face tattooed untill Febuary 2003. Anyway enough about that I just found it funny. Although they did a good job. It looks genuine.

The dvd itself is a bit of a letdown. It's mainly revolves around his European tour he did back in the year 2000. Mostly the camera follows him as he buys stuff like a million dollar watch and speaks to hundreds of Brixton fans via a handheld loudspeaker. The best parts of this dvd is when Mike is at press confrences trash talking and living up to the public's and media's expectations of Tyson. Some of the worst parts are interviews with people about Mike Tyson. Not because people shouldn't have their say but the camera is far to close to some of them. There is this one man in particular who is interviewed throughout the film and the camera must be about 15 inches away from his face. It gets very annoying (like my spelling mistakes).

Even though this dvd was released this year it was made a few years ago (before he fought Lennox Lewis). It does have interviews with Lewis just as advertised but they are interviews before the two even had a date set to face off in the ring. Be warned there is no footage past 2001. The dvd does not deserve the tittle ""Mike vs Tyson"". It is not in depth and barly a documentry. It has no footage of him in the ring (just pictures). It does have a lot of footage I hadn't seen before and being a huge Mike Tyson fan for $10 that is good enough for me. If you want a really good Mike Tyson documentry check out ""Killer Instinct"". In short ""Mike vs Tyson"" is a perfect example of false advertising.

The running time is only 50 mins.",1101340800,21,2135,4.27970297029703
7986151,3,B00008OSEG,"Mike vs Tyson Doesn't Live Up To It's Subject or Title

This is just ok.

It's not really a documentary - this is the London view of Mike Tyson's recent past.  Most of the footage is shot in England.

There is some info regarding his coming up and his past, but not a lot.

The film falls far short of ""examining the man described as a monster by his critics and a hero by his fans""

It's interesting and gratifying to see Mike walking around and shopping and being portrayed as a human being rather than a crazy, angry monster.

If you're a Tyson fan then this is a nice addition to your collection of knowledge or materials (DVD collection)

If you're not a fan you can skip this one.",1100649600,6,686,4.223076923076923
