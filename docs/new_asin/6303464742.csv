658736,5,6303464742,"When you realize this is the screen directing debut of Freddie Francis,the excellent cinematographer(Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,Room at the Top,The Innocents) and scripted by Jimmy Sangster(who also did Maniac and Scream of Fear)from a gothic novel,as part of the Hammer stable,this is one of their excellent post-Psycho psychological thrillers in black and white,with the young,magnetic Ollie Reed, you know you are in for a great time. It's part of the genre of let's-drive-the-heiress-mad to gain the whole inheritance scenarios. Eleanor(Scott) is the emotional,beautiful,vulnerable sister who glimpses a figure who seems like her deceased brother Tony,at the church memorial service for her late parents. He commited suicide 7 years previously. Her brother Simon Ashby(Reed),wastrel, uses this to prove she's mentally unbalanced and not worthy of the inheritance. Simon is a brutish alcoholic,over-spending on money he hasn't yet got. Eleanor doubts her sanity and tries to kill herself. She is saved by Tony(Davion),the supposedly dead brother. He claims there was no suicide,just a disappearance. He has returned,just in time to claim the family inheritance. Simon and auntie Harriet(Burrell), put him to the test with the corrupt family lawyer,asking him questions which he passes. Simon and Harriet still know he's not Tony,but an impostor. The style is between manor-house gothic and modernity. Hammer's corner of Englishness.

Reed is at his magnificent best,sardonically charming yet also explosive and unpredictable,given over to scenes of heavy drinking and plotting to kill the impostor. There are Hitchcockian cliff-top scenes out of Rebecca. This is all reinforced by Lutyens music.'Tony' finds himself falling in love with Scott and admits that he's an impostor. There are hints of madness in the family,incest,murder. Eleanour's hysteria on falling in love with supposedbrother and Harriet's relationship with Simon,play on the incest theme. Davion restores Scott to sanity and flushes out the real madness of Simon(organ playing in the cellar to his murdered brother's skeleton) and crazy aunt Harriet, setting the place ablaze after dressing up in a grotesque mask and attacking Davion with a hook. There are some great plot twists,Francis building the suspense well with genuinely frightening sequences and good pace. Sangster's script is plotted along conventional,gothic,melodramatic lines. Oliver Reed holds the whole film together,swinging between Byronic/Heathcliffian sexuality and Norman Bates-style madness. The film has a Psycho-type denouement. Editing is sharp,snappy and to-the point. This film with its sumptuous cinematography is the best in its genre. Reed makes one wonder why he never became the best actor in England,but his off-screen persona stole that. Incidentally,this is now obtainable on DVD release by Eureka!(2010).",1334707200,2,2870,5.784869976359338
658737,4,6303464742,"Written by Jimmy Sangster and directed by Freddie Francis, 1963's ""Paranoiac"" is a very well made Hammer production starring a great cast including Oliver Reed, Janette Scott and Alexander Davion.  As usual with Sangster, he was a master at writing some beautifully constructed thrillers.  This one concerns Oliver Reed as a paranoiac, out to commit his sister (Scott) to an insane asylum just weeks before their large inheritance comes into effect.  Enter the long-thought dead other brother (Davion).  Scott and Davion have a great chemistry and, of course, Reed chews up the scenery, especially after the slightly rip-off ending of Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""  This is one of Freddie Francis's triumphs.  The black-and-white photography by Arthur Grant is on great display with this Eureka Video edition in a fabulous Blu-ray presentation.  The sound quality is spectacular.  Also contains the original trailer and 56 pages of ephemera.",1329177600,7,933,5.430555555555555

2/11: Dark, brooding, combative, sexy, and absolutely talented, Oliver Reed, once upon a time, was the rage of England's cinema.

As great of a talent Oliver Reed was as an actor, his potential was largely untapped throughout his career which is a shame.

Paranoiac is a wonderful treat for Oliver Reed fans and new viewers alike. This is some of the best stuff of his career.

In Paranoiac, Oliver Reed is drop dead gorgeous in black and white. It's very hard to take your eyes off him.

Although saddled with a weak ending, Hammer Horror's Paranoiac plays out like an episode from The Twilight Zone with a lot of twists and turns. Yet, the cast does a nice job by sticking it out to the end.

But make no mistake about it: the show starts and ends with Oliver Reed. Without him, there is no Paranoiac.

All in all, Oliver Reed was a very gifted actor.

12/17: When Oliver Reed appears in Paranoiac, it's literally impossible to take your eyes off him, and he is absolutely drop dead gorgeous in black and white.

Mad, bad, and dangerous to know, Oliver Reed tears up the screen as Simon Ashby the youthful drunk who is set to inherit his family fortune. If you think that he is not the show, you are sadly mistaken.

Playing out like an episode from The Twilight Zone with a touch of Psycho, Paranoiac is a strange addition to Hammer Horror collection because oif the absence of colors. Yet there's no question that Freddie Francis' photography (although Arthur Grant was in the charge of it) is dazzling, only to be greatly enhanced by Oliver Reed's presence.

Born in Cannes, Liliane Brousse was beautiful back then. She didn't have much of an acting career, having appeared in two more films before calling it quits a year later.

All in all, Paranoiac begins and ends with Oliver Reed.",1297123200,2,1820,4.583333333333333
658739,2,6303464742,"I watched this movie hoping to be both captivated and repelled by the pure-evil-Oliver-Reed. I was more repelled, I gotta say. It was very soap opera, forced emotions, silly plot. Nice cinematography though. The end is so patently ridiculous. If you want a yawn and big laugh at the end, check this one out.",1290816000,2,307,4.703703703703703
658740,4,6303464742,"I have been slowly watching a DVD set called The Hammer Horror Series. It features 8 classic Hammer films from the 50's and 60's including this film. I never saw this as a kid and I was quite surprised how much I liked it. More of a thriller/mystery with some horror elements but, good just the same. It does have it's creepy moments and a few good scares. It's one of the better movies in the set and the DVD transfer is very good. I rate this old B&W Hammer film 3 1/2 stars.",1199664000,2,477,4.085106382978723
658741,4,6303464742,"A delicious horror psychodrama, about a splintered aristocratic family with more than a few hidden secrets.  A young Oliver Reed is wonderfully way over the top as a possessive, demented, violent older brother who struggles to control the rest of the family.  Nicely directed, and well shot (with a heavy debt to Hitchcock)... Good fun, although the ending is lamentably rushed.",1039824000,2,378,5.180327868852459
658742,3,6303464742,"This story revolves around a young girl who may be crazy and her alchoholic brother. Their parents died years ago in a plane crash and their older brother Tony is believed to have committed suicide when he was a  child. Then a man shows up claiming to be Tony because he says he faked his  suicide and ran away. His sister believes him, but everyone else has their  doubts. Then it looks like someone is trying to commit murder and no one is  certain who is sane and who is not.  I had always heard this film was  just average, but I think it is above average. There are some suspenseful  moments here and there, good photography and the cast is overall solid.  Oliver Reed is actually exceptional in his role, probably his best  performance with Hammer. The film could have been improved by not playing  their hand so soon, in that they revealed too much too soon. The film would  have benefitted by being patient and building a mysterious mood for most of  the film, instead we see one mysterious scene followed directly by a scene  that reveals what is going on.  Not perfect, but fairly interesting to  watch late at night.",952992000,9,1127,4.482758620689655

7848038,4,6303464742,"Is Tony really back from the dead?

Featuring a young, cynical and abusively-alcoholic Oliver Reed, this film should be in at least the top-15 psychological thrillers of all time. The film begins with the annual honoring of the passing of Tony, who (as the story goes) committed suicide at 15 years of age. But when a man who looks, sounds and knows much what Tony would know shows-up on the estate, Oliver Reed (the brother) and his overseeing Aunt begin to worry they'll be cut out of the inheritance. But is it really ""the"" Tony? This was a terrifically-written, suspenseful film with some very satisfying and unexpected twists that you'll love.",1477612800,2,648,4.837837837837838

7848043,5,6303464742,"Already had this movie as part of The Hammer Collection on DVD. Paranoiac is the best of the set. Have always enjoyed Oliver Reed (a great underrated actor) as a sinister character and he does not disappoint here. Too bad more Hammer films aren't being released on blu ray. I have a few from Synapse from the early '70s, but they don't seem to have the atmosphere as in Paranoiac. This blu ray really blows the DVD away! The 2.35 widescreen image is much sharper and detailed. This import from the UK is from a reliable company called Eureka. They have done some really good stuff on blu ray. After all these years, this creepy film from the great Freddie Francis still gets to me. Now if they would only release my favorite Hammer film SCREAM OF FEAR on blu ray...",1374192000,3,765,4.432624113475177
