4829137,5,B005LKH624,"The locations are stunning, Green and Smith act their parts beautifully. This film will make you cry, and while some parts are uncomfortable they are presented gracefully and are extremely thought provoking and emotional. The characters are, though the actors, very easy to relate to even in a movie about human clones. Their actions and decisions are not cut and dry good or bad but extremely complicated, and the turmoil that rack Green and Smith is evident in their superb acting.",1371168000,6,483,4.9753086419753085
4829138,5,B005LKH624,"There aren't a lot of movies out like this. It had a very good spin off of cloning. It was unpredictable, which is always a plus in any movie. I didn't find it boring at all. I guess you just have to understand that this isn't a movie that is full of action. Here are some quite scenes in the movie, but they scenes are still good",1370131200,7,330,3.9402985074626864
4829139,4,B005LKH624,"I initial watched this film because I'm a big Dr Who fan and was interested in seeing Matt Smith in another setting.

I was a little perplexed after I watched it the first time (fortunely I recorded it) and began to enjoy it more each time I viewed it.  This is one of those films you can't just see once and ""get"" it.

The reviewer that went on and on about the two versions of the person they kept referring to as ""Michael 1 and 2"" when his name was Thomas must have very bored and only saw it once.

If you like interesting quirky movies and can see it more than once, this is a movie you should see.",1347667200,,603,4.0
4829140,1,B005LKH624,"Two quirky, lonely kids in a seaside village realize they're soul mates. Then, the girl (who lives with her grandpa) is whisked away to Tokyo by her mom. After she reaches adulthood, graduates from college, and gets a good job, she returns to her now-deceased grandpa's cottage. She wants to reconnect with her childhood friend. His parents direct her to a really derelict building, where Michael is now some sort of anarchist who raises cockroaches. (He releases them en masse to cause panics in controversial buildings, part of his protests.) He seems to have no job, and no direction, and he's not particularly attractive. Nevertheless, the two rekindle their relationship. And then, right when it's about to get off the ground, he gets hit by a car.

Her reaction to this is to ask his parents to allow her to exhume his body so that she can have him cloned, and she carries the clone-fetus to term and gives birth to her boyfriend. (Why? Why not instead move on and try to establish a relationship with someone more, I don't know, normal? And does the world really need another slacker? Shouldn't we be cloning Albert Schweitzers?)

There are so many interesting directions this film could have taken. Apparently, clones are highly controversial in this near-future but sort of contemporary setting, and Michael 2nd Edition is ostracized. Mom/former squeeze's reaction to this is to move from her cosy little cottage to a dilapidated beach house, where they live in isolated squalor. The whole love me/love my clone issue is dropped.

The cloning process is a tease. Michael 1st Edition was planning to make a statement by doing the cockroach-panic thing at a biomed center; they were on their way to do that when he was killed. But then Elizabeth ends up going there to have the ""clonebryo"" implanted. No more is said. So the whole bioethics issue is dropped, too.

Michael 2e ends up finding a girlfriend, and Elizabeth has really mixed feelings about this, because Michael 2e is now almost as old as Michael 1e was when he died, so there is that whole Oedipal thing going on (as another reviewer mentioned). And it's not strictly Oedipal because she's not related to him. But the treatment of this is REALLY BORING. The whole movie is REALLY BORING, except the swarming cockroach scene did give me an anxiety rush because I'm insect-phobic, kind of. Other than that, Michael 2e and his mom/whatever just sort of sat in this beach house that BADLY needed a coat of paint. Had this film involved Michael actually painting the house, it would have been more interesting for the viewer to watch that paint dry than to have to endure these long lingering shots of angsty expressions and dialogue that leaves a lot unsaid yet moves nothing forward.

This is one of those movies that sounded interesting, and so I watched because I just knew the pace would pick up. I was wrong.

But it did inspire me to touch up my windowsills.",1338163200,12,2930,4.769230769230769
4829141,4,B005LKH624,"...with a touch of Kafka thrown in.  This ultimately unsatisfying film is not for everyone, and certainly not for the prudish.

4829142,5,B005LKH624,"I saw this film at the BFI London Film Festival in 2010 while I was staying in London for a six week holiday. At the time I wrote a review for my blog, here it is: Impeccable execution and a gorgeous film. Amazingly well done, despite the sticky content. The scenery where the film was shot was dark and cold, but with bursts of blue sky occasionally through the clouds. The ocean waves and the cold snowy beaches juxtaposed with beech wood forests was definitely a sight to behold. Rebecca, our protagonist, gave birth to and raised Thomas' clone as her son, even though she must have known she'd feel something other than motherly instinct for him as he got older and looked exactly like her deceased lover. The ending of the film was a bit shockingly Oedipal but also gorgeously executed and just all around well done. I really enjoyed the Q&A with the director and two of the actors because it provided more insight to the location where they filmed as well as what the director wanted to convey with the `fairy tale' aspect of the film, which he said was a love story.",1326067200,16,1073,4.479591836734694

Of course, I had to see it because of Matt Smith (of Doctor Who fame), and he gave a very powerful performance in this movie. The story is intense and may be uncomfortable to watch, but it is very well played, and it really makes you think deeply about a controversial issue. This movie is NOT for those who are sensitive or narrow-minded.

My only complaints are that there should've been a scene where the original Tommy and Rebecca make love before the car accident and the the entire film should've had a wider range of music scores in the background. Other than that, I loved the film as a whole.",1389744000,,674,4.435483870967742
4829159,3,B005LKH624,"Some of the previous reviews have gone into great detail regarding the plot of this film, so I will instead address the parts when I wanted to grab the character Rebecca and slap her. Many conversations in the film are done not with words, but with the vacuous stare of Rebecca. Her son, Thomas, asks questions often: about his father, about why the children and parents shun him, what is her relationship to him really. Rather than explain things in a logical way, Rebecca gives curt answers or just stares. Poor kid. Bathing with your child; not a good idea. The concept of cloning a person and carrying them through gestation does not mean that the raising of that child removes the mother/child bond. There are mothers who adopt children and create that bond. Having us believe Rebecca gave birth and raised Thomas and did not have any maternal feelings for him really stretched the bounds of credibility. What totally flabbergasted me was the second half of the film when Rebecca and Thomas have moved to the run-down cottage way out in the middle of nowhere. In this remote location they seemed to have a better Wi-Fi connection than *I* do. Some reviewers found this to be a great film, I found it to be a bit creepy. But the fact that I've bothered to review it makes it worth three stars. This film will not change your life, but it's worth a peek.",1380240000,7,1357,4.565573770491803

8478205,5,B005LKH624,"It is unique, thought-provoking, sparsely cinematic, well directed, and well acted.

I collect films and one of my most treasured kinds of films are those that are both emotionally engaging and thought-provoking. In my experience, such films are very rare and usually just beyond my comfort zone. If your habitual sense of entertainment does not include this kind of occasional spice, then more's the pity.

However, if you want to be drawn into a state of thoughtfulness about things like ""the nature of personhood"" and ""the limitations of reproductive freedom"" by deeply visceral performances and a script that lets your imagination fill in some of the blanks, then this film will give you and others a couple of hours of discussion.

I came to this film my way of a trek to the local Good Will store and the doorway of my interest in Eva Green (would she or wouldn't she do as well as she did in Casino Royale?). On the whole, I rate this as a better film in my collection and nothing disappoints. The settings are sparse but beautiful. The cinematography is lean and memorable. The script leaves small gaps that require the viewer to imagine the inner workings of the characters. The direction and pace are unhurried the way people living on the edge of civilization might live their inner lives.

This film left me with several questions: Are human being inherently and organically judgmental to the point of being exclusionary? Will concerns about gender and race be one day replaced with concern about originality and authenticity even though the accusers are among the least original and authentically human beings? Can female romantic obsession overshadow the female drive to nurture offspring? Are women, or at least obsessed women, doomed to unhappiness (just as one could argue men or obsessed men are)? At some deep level, is genetic engineering (or at least genetic cloning) an expression of self-absorption or the incestuousness depicted in Greek tragedy? Why could Miss Green's character and the young man she gave birth to just as easily lived happily ever after?

In my collection, I pair this with ""Never Let Me Go"" and (in an odd way) ""Birth.""

On the negative side, this DVD could have greatly benefited by some bonus features that explored these and other questions from the writer's, director's, and actors' points of view.",1527292800,,2346,4.941624365482234

8478209,1,B005LKH624,"So I sat down one evening to watch a disturbing little art film about Eva Green and Matt Smith and cloning and maybe a little bit of incest. And I got that, mostly. But do you know what I got that I was completely unprepared for?
A little boy dragging a long sheet of plastic that he had obviously gotten from the beach right through Eva Green's living room, with her just watching and saying nothing. Some child who is there as a GUEST and she just lets him bring garbage into her home.
Matt Smith constantly standing just a little too close? I can take it. Children slowly burying a mechanical toy dinosaur while it pitifully tries to walk? Easy. Weird sexual tension between a mother and her son, culminating in a sex scene that made me want to squirm out of my skin? I lived.
But that sheet of dirty plastic being dragged through that living room. That is the scene that will haunt me for the rest of my days.",1501459200,,913,4.283236994219653

8478211,4,B005LKH624,Unusual film that leaves you pondering. Interesting filming locations. Certainly one to watch if you are a fan of Eva or Matt but If you like a straightforward story line that is clearly understood and zips up seamlessly at the end it is probably not for you.,1490572800,,259,4.531914893617022
8478212,5,B005LKH624,"This is one of the films that it is almost impossible to review without a spoiler of the central idea.  In a stunning performance that is more mood than action, Eva Green is an introverted woman who returns to her childhood home seeking love.  She goes back to meet this wonderful boy, with whom she shared an extraordinary connection as a child.  This consumes her, with all sorts of bizarre consequences, particularly the scifi element, which works out a scenario in great and sensuous detail.  But above all, it is a fine drama, with interesting characters and more questions than answers, all of which is unusual for a well worked out scifi film.

The film is slow, but the emotional states are extremely subtle, often unexpected, trying to get at human truths in a bold new future.  Nothing spectacular, just human in a new context.  Warmly recommended.",1479168000,,858,4.795918367346939
8478213,2,B005LKH624,"This review is for the blu-ray version 'Womb' released in 2013.

I bought this movie on a recommendation from several 'lists' of best independent sci-fi movies. Obviously from my rating I am not in complete agreement with these lists and I am in the minority with my rating so I would read some other more positive reviews before making a decision on buying/watching this movie. Also be warned.....there are lots of SPOILERS in this review.

'Womb' is a story that takes place (I suppose) in the near future where people are allowed to be cloned. A young woman loses her boyfriend in an accident and convinces his parents to allow her to give birth to her boyfriend's clone. She gives birth and and the movie progresses through several stages until the boy reaches the age at which his previous self died. Will Rebecca give in to her incestuous impulses?

My low rating would make it appear that I hated the movie and don't appreciate it or 'get it.' Essentially I rate it two stars because my rating is for people other than myself. If somebody asked me if they should watch it I would tell them it's not for most people.
I do 'get it.' I actually like that fact that it is something different and not something you see every day. I am glad I watched it and I'm not one of the people who says ""I want my two hours of life back."" 'Womb' has an interesting premise. The problem is that the movie is just boring and I felt the acting was repetitive and the behavior of the characters was unrealistic. I'll explain:

I'm not an action junkie and for the most part I am normally bored during action sequences...if that makes any sense. I enjoy a good plot and once the revelations are out in the open I tend to be anxious for a movie to end. For example, in a murder mystery, once the killer is known...most movies will spend the last 15 minutes with a chase and fight seen in which you already know what the result is going to be. Unless there is a twist, for me, the movie is essentially over during the chase.
I enjoy a slow build up but this movie has very little build up. All you really do is sit around and wait for Tommy to get older so you can see what happens. And really, not much happens. It's just a lot of just sad looking faces. Rebecca just sits there and does nothing for most of the movie. This is OK for awhile. It takes a talented actor/actress to convey what they are thinking through facial expressions. The problem here is that this done over and over and over again till it gets just downright boring waiting for her (and him) to say something. The editors could easily have lopped off 30-45 minutes of this movie without it changing a thing.

***Spoilers ahead*** For instance, Tommy started having a fit and acting like a lunatic when he didn't even know the reason why his mother was acting funny after his real mother shows up. Rebecca never says a word.
Another part I didn't like was when Tommy, Rebecca and Monica are on the porch and Tommy sticks his head into Rebecca's breasts. Monica runs off and the next seen they act like nothing out of the ordinary happened. I'm not sure if this is an editing error or budgetary constraint of just poor plotting. I just don't see a guy doing this sort of thing in front of his girlfriend no matter what the circumstances.
You'd figure that two people that lived in isolation the way they do would be able to communicate better. Especially since they get along very well and it's established that there is no real tension between them. Rebecca even manages to hold back her emotions when Tommy comes home with a girlfriend and she hears him having sex with her.  I'm not really sure why she can't tell him how he came to be. Why confuse him with pictures and computer files? Just tell him the truth. Why wouldn't Rebecca just tell Tommy who 'that woman' was rather than let him go crazy and behave almost suicidal?
I felt that that that very same scene was gripping and filled with tension but then it just goes and on and on and continues into the next scene and goes on and on without Rebecca telling Tommy who 'that woman' was. Just tell him already! How many minutes? hours? days? pass until she lets him know and even then she doesn't tell him...she shows him.
Tommy uses the same old unoriginal lines ""I don't know who I am anymore"" (or something to that effect, I don't feel like going back and checking) that I've heard many times before. This seems out of place in a movie with an original idea and is just poor writing. I mean, really, just because you are cloned, that doesn't mean you have the memories of the person. It's not really any different than having an identical twin. You shouldn't be having an identity crisis.

I felt the 'look' of the movie was rather bland. It is at times lifeless and colorless. Of course, that was probably intended but I'm not a big fan of movies that use that look but I recognize the fact that there is a time and place for it. I also didn't like that Rebecca doesn't seem to age at all. She looks practically the same throughout the movie even though she should have aged 20 years.

Any movie about consensual incest is not going to do well with sales. I'm not sure what the box office revenues were, but I'm guessing it wasn't that good. Of course the movie had 'only' a 13 million dollar budget but still..... I'd have to guess that a good chunk of the budget was for paying the actors and advertising and distribution because there isn't a lot of special effects, especially for a science fiction movie and a large part of the movie is filmed in the same locations. It does star Eva Green of James Bond fame and Matt Smith of Dr. Who fame but I don't know if Matt Smith was well known yet at the time this movie was made.

Finally, I'm not really sure what the ending means. Does Tommy leave for good? Does he go back to Mom? Does he sleep with her again in the future? I guess it's meant to leave it up to the viewer to decide on how it should end.

I give this movie a 3/10 for plot, 5/10 for acting and 10/10 for 'something different'.

It seems like every time I watch a movie made in the British Isles these days, I see actors from 'Game of Thrones!'

Recommended for science fiction fans who want to see something different.",1465430400,,6251,4.360824742268041
