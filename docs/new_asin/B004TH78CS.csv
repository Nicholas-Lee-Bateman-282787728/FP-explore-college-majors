8440670,5,B004TH78CS,"Very cool and entertaining spy movie in the James Bond tradition. A must if you are a genre fan who, like me, are obsessed with sixties cinema scene and can,t live without OSS 117, James Bond, 3S3, 077, Derek Flint or Matt Helm!  Vince Edwards is great and
so are the other cast members.",1485820800,,287,4.314814814814815

8440672,5,B004TH78CS,"Hammerhead starred Diana Dors and was released in 1968. She is very beautiful as always. Nice  support by Judy Geeson, and Vince Edwards make this good viewing. A Eurospy film cashing in on the James Bond cult of the 1960's. Fans of Diana Dors will like this the most.",1439596800,,268,4.469387755102041

8440674,2,B004TH78CS,The DVD restoration is good but the film makes no sense and I don't think it's caused by poor editing. It simply isn't worth watching.,1417996800,,134,4.4

8440677,5,B004TH78CS,"Just a fun movie from the 60's. Great music by Madeline Bell. Also Judy Geeson sings a song in the movie, but it is not on the soundtrack.",1355702400,3,138,3.9642857142857144
8440678,4,B004TH78CS,"No, this is not a movie about sharks.  Director David Miller's 'HAMMERHEAD' happens to be the name of the megalomaniac villain of this enjoyable spy romp released after the floodgates opened with every country which had a film industry cashed in on the James Bond craze.  This one introduces us to secret agent Charles Hood played (the term is used loosely) by Vince Edwards who is on the trail of our villain excellently acted by Peter Vaughan who wants to gain access to a gigantic missile defense system. Vaughan always played great villains and would peak a few years later in Sam Peckinpah's 'STRAW DOGS'.  Judy Geeson and Diana Dors do what they can with the convoluted cliched screenplay which is based on a novel by James Mayo.  Along the way, we genre fans are treated to cameos from many British faces:  Patrick Cargill, Maggie Wright, Tracy Reed, Hammer horror stars Veronica Carlson and David Prowse, and Joseph Furst among others.  The locations are beautiful but the 60's psychedelic sequences seem pretty dated as they probably were even by 1968 standards.  It is produced by Irving Allen who gave us the Matt Helm series and we even have gorgeous Beverly Adams popping up (or is out) in her beautiful bikini to remind us of those films with Dino.  In fact , Dean Martin seems like Orson Welles compared to our main hero Vince Edwards.  It boggles my mind to this day how he was ever considered a sex symbol or leading man material, he has no sense of belonging or even caring about the proceedings.  When he embraces (?) Beverly Adams, you almost feel sorry that she has to brace up against an over 200 pound stiff slab of meat and try to look amorous. Judy Geeson may have had it worse, she's stuck in a coffin with him in a 15 minute comedic sequence. Despite Edwards, the film is very entertaining and worth a look for all you spy fans out there. Columbia releases the film in a beautiful 1.85 transfer with eye-popping color and is a DVD-R which Amazon has at a good price.  With good production values and a great supporting cast, it emerges as an adequate entry in the Eurospy genre.",1303776000,13,2105,4.586666666666667
