8454407,3,B000FUF7GC,"Since a date of 2006 is listed at the top of the page for this item on the Amazon.com webpage, I was expecting something new and fresh for programming.  But these dvd's are from the 1990's.  The back cover of the dvd box says ""Program content and artwork copywrite 1995, 1997, 1998"".  The ""Girls Of Spring Break"" dvd was clearly filmed in 1990-1991, because you can read the dates on the signs and license plates on the cars.  So the girls have big hair (90's hairstyles) and their pubic hair is not shaved.  And back in the 1990's, Playboy did not film the pubic area much...sort of a tease of pubic hair...a few glimpses and then the camera pulls away...tease.  This is standard Playboy stuff from the Playboy Channel that was released to VHS in the past decade...sort of tame by today's standards of ""Girls Gone Wild"".  But, if you are expecting some light Playboy 1990's fluff with big hair, lots of breasts, and some distant glimpses of pubic hair...you might still like it...a little.  But I like my Girls Gone Wild dvd collection better.",1161993600,15,1044,4.605405405405405
