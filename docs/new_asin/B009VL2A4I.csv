5369381,5,B009VL2A4I,"I have to say that Stephene Cone's commentary piece in the bonus/extra section, ""Religion and Sexuality in the Wise Kids"", is one of the most intelligent, articulate, and succinct 11 minutes on film that I have experienced in a long time.  Here is a writer/director that is insightful to his work and purposeful in his writing.  I have always thought that art preceeds society and Mr Cone sees the currents in our culture.  Looking forward to his next project.",1360195200,4,460,4.7974683544303796
5369382,5,B009VL2A4I,"Coming of age, in a small town near Charleston SC, are a group of high school seniors involved in their local Baptist church's drama and music ministry.  The film focuses primarily on three of these students:  Brea, daughter of the church's minister but who finds herself questioning her Christian beliefs; Tim, a very personable and talented young man who has revealed - to his single dad and closest friends - that he is gay; and Laura, an ambitious and focused girl who expresses doubts at the revelations of the other two.  They are involved in an Easter pageant, under the direction of  Austin (Stephen Cone, who also wrote and directed the film), whose working with the self-assured Tim makes him suspect what may be the reason for his own passion-less eight year marriage.  While most of the graduates will be going to nearby colleges, Brea and Tim will be attending schools in New York City, which makes their friends and family wonder if and how it will change them.

With a tiny budget, Cone manages to create a film that feels understated and subtle, while at the same time riveting the viewer and delivering a cohesive, powerful message of self-acceptance, diversity and true friendship.  It does not challenge religion or sexuality, but reinforces that they can coincide among people who respect each other.  The acting is superb, especially Tyler Ross (who also starred in ""Nate and Margaret) as Tim, and Molly Kunz as the complex yet relatable Brea. Won highest awards at the Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta and Memphis LGBT film festivals, and awarded a Critic's Pick by the New York Times.  DVD extras include a ""making of"" feature and discussion of the treatment of religion and homosexuality in the film.  Not rated, but likely a PG-13, appropriate (and recommended) for mixed audiences.  My favorite for the year, thus far, and I give it a full five stars out of five.",1358035200,2,1892,4.826625386996904
5369383,5,B009VL2A4I,"I can't begin to describe what this movie meant to me. It's so kind and compassionate to every character while providing such an amazing commentary on what it's like to grow up in the very religious south. It never condescends, always loves and is perfectly heart breaking (and funny!). Watch watch watch.",1357171200,4,305,4.884615384615385
5369384,5,B009VL2A4I,Very thoughtful movie for young christian teens learning about sexuality. Works through a whole year of coming of age young christians.,1356566400,,135,5.476190476190476
5369385,5,B009VL2A4I,"""The Wise Kids"" is a small ensemble film that is led by two charismatic young leads, Molly Kunz and Tyler Ross. They give impressive and nuanced performances as two childhood friends who are becoming adults. Kunz is Brea, the daughter of a minister whose church is the center of life in this small town in South Carolina. Ross (who was excellent in ""Nick & Margaret,"" one of the unheralded indie gems of 2012) portrays Tim, her best friend who is just beginning to accept his homosexuality but is otherwise well-adjusted and confident.

Both characters are headed to New York for college in the fall, and in the remaining months they have at home they struggle to keep their families and friends close while also seeking some freedom and adventure far away. However, the greater part of their journey is the spiritual maturation that takes place even before they head off for school. Brea begins to have doubts about religion and its role in her life. I found the development of her character the most interesting and poignant, because the filmmakers wisely leave unexplained the roots of her growing doubt. I think sometimes people just grow apart from God and from each other as they come into their own personalities and beliefs as adults and outgrow the small, parochial spaces of home and high school. The film succeeds in capturing some of the magic and mystery of these little earthquakes of young adulthood.

There is an intensity to Allison Torem's supporting performance as Laura, the third in the trio of friends, that may be both discomfiting and familiar to anyone who has ever felt their world being upended. She brings truth and conviction to her performance as a young devout Christian who entrenches further into dogma as her values and beliefs are threatened. In an earlier scene in the film, Tim asks if God is in nature and in people, and the film seems to be asking rhetorically then, Why should questioning God's word be any less wrong than questioning God's creation? I like how the film doesn't try to answer these questions, but allows the characters to make their own unspoken peace with their uncertainties and doubts.

There are quiet, sensitive moments in the film consisting of long-held closeups of the characters' faces, hinting at repressed desires and frustrations. In these wistful scenes, more is often said by the words left unspoken. The ending of the film is understated and truthful, with no easy resolutions. But pay particular attention to Brea and who she is standing with in the final scene.

This is a very perceptive, honest, and insightful film about religion and human behavior without being preachy or satirical. In that respect alone, it's a great accomplishment. ""The Wise Kids"" was released around the same time as another good film, Vera Farmiga's ""Higher Ground,"" which explores similar themes. Both films are equally moving in their own ways.",1356480000,11,2897,4.930327868852459
5369386,5,B009VL2A4I,"Wonderful,beautiful little Indy film that doesn't fall back on the usual, tired stereotypes when telling it's coming of age tale. Lovely, just lovely.",1351468800,11,150,5.565217391304348
5369387,5,B009VL2A4I,"This is a rare, quiet, beautiful film. Sensitive, sincere and void of an irony. A real gem in this fast paced and story less world now. The character take their time to develop.",1394755200,,177,4.393939393939394
5369388,5,B009VL2A4I,Fairly well done movie. Thought provoking . It brings out some of the questioning thoughts of believers of seinors in high school. Really quite a turning point in teenagers lives . Leaving what has been familiar for four years and venturing into a whole new world where questions and realities abound. If parents could watch this movie with their teenagers it might be a great icebreaker to help answer some of their questions of what lies beyond high school.,1393891200,,459,4.822784810126582
5369389,5,B009VL2A4I,"This is the first I have seen of Stephen Cone and it is incredible. This is a phenomenal example of a movie that tells more by saying less. What this director gets out of these actors, and himself as an actor, is incredible. Whether you agree or disagree with any of the viewpoints of this movie, they are all backdrop here for a movie about real human beings and their emotions. My only complaint is that I was confused over the relationship (family relations, i.e. brother/sister or friends, etc.) between a few of the characters. This reminds me of the movie Save Me in that all of the characters, Christians/Atheist, Straight/Gay, come off not looking bad, or wrong, but just looking as real people struggling to figure out their lives.",1386633600,4,740,4.7
5369390,4,B009VL2A4I,"Outstanding performances from the young ensemble cast, especially Tyler Ross (star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nate-Margaret/dp/B007Z9RRVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nate & Margaret</a>) highlight this dramatic film which actually follows 2 very deep storylines.  The primary focus is on teenager Tim (played by Ross) as he maneuvers his Baptist upbringing with the realization he is gay.  His closest friends take 2 sides as they come to terms with something that challenges their faith.

Meanwhile, Austin (played by Stephen Cone) is the involved church member.  He and his wife are leading the church production.  As Tim begins to accept and embrace his sexuality (alongside a supportive father), the event triggers Austin to question his own sexuality.  Dramatic and complex, everything changes, more so for Austin than Tim.  A visible stark contrast is present between the two experiences.  After all, for Tim, college life and his entire future await.  For Austin, the challenge is far more engrossing - a prominent church position, a wife - what are his next steps?

If only films like this would make it mainstream - it would do the world well to see the comprehensive battles individuals face during coming out, especially for those late in life.

The production is a mix of Lifetime Movie meets Afterschool Special meets Christian programming.  At times, the acting / flow can be quite annoying but overall, the production - and the message - carries the film.  No doubt a low-budget production, the music soundtrack is actually quite impressive.  For me, one of the most endearing scenes was the birthday dance, which featured the song ""Crosswalk Stereo"" by The Pass.  Parts of the film, along with the character Tim reminded me of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perks-of-Being-a-Wallflower/dp/B00AVTMCYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a>"", minus the big Hollywood financing.

Watch carefully, and you'll catch the message in some of the final conversations in the closing scene.  Powerful, dramatic, The Wise Kids provides a forum for a critical message about understanding and acceptance.",1382745600,5,2224,5.857142857142857
5369391,3,B009VL2A4I,"I thought the concept of the film had promise, and the young actors did a nice job. The characters were believable and the situations realistic. The script and the directing, however, were pretty darn bad. There were one or two poignant moments worthy of being put onscreen; unfortunately, the writer/director appears to have felt like one of these moments happened every two minutes. There were ridiculously drawn-out scenes and conversations, vacant stares, knowing looks... but instead of being poignant they were just roll-your-eyes silly. I don't mind slow films when there's a point to them moving slow and there's enough dramatic tension or eye candy or beautiful cinematography or something onscreen to hold my interest, but this movie seemed to be slow just because the script was shorter than the film the director wanted to make. Both the actors and the film took... forever... to... say... anything... and... in... the... end... didn't... have... much... to... say... at... all. But the main actor was cute enough and the intentions were good enough that I'll give it three stars. It was okay.",1381622400,3,1105,5.144444444444445
5369392,1,B009VL2A4I,"I watched this last night on Netflix thinking this would be a clean Christian movie. I was surprised and shocked at what I saw. It has a very pro-homosexual agenda. I DO NOT hate homosexuals, they are people God loves and Jesus died to redeem, but I do have a problem with the sin. In God's eyes it is an abomination. God does not change, it is still an abomination. We as a society are being fed lies that this is ""normal"" and some ""are born this way"". God DOES NOT create anyone this way. Just like all other sin such as murder, lying, stealing, disobeying, etc, this is a sin that God will forgive if we only repent. I was saddened at the ending--which was rather abrupt--that these teens chose the way of godlessness and destruction. I cannot recommend this film and will not be watching it again.",1379548800,2,801,4.382550335570469
5369393,5,B009VL2A4I,This is a movie worth buying and watching. I do not regret having done so and will watch it over and over again. Very intersting story that tries to make you think out of the box.,1379376000,,179,4.0
5369394,4,B009VL2A4I,"I enjoyed this little movie about small towns and chuches and their level of acceptabce for things new to them. The filmmaker knew what he was talking about on this one, very nice performances by young actors.",1378252800,,209,4.675675675675675
5369395,5,B009VL2A4I,"Wow. Movies don't get much better than this little gem.

Nothing is either predictable or stereotyped, none of the characters are one-dimensional villains or good guys, gays don't hate Christians and Christians don't hate gays, homos and heteros get along okay - and yet (and this is the movie's most astounding accomplishment) every person in it is real and complex and nobody gets shoehorned into a false and creepy ""let's all just love one another"" box.

These are real people, doing what real people do in tough situations. Not ranting at each other like the morons on talk radio and in Congress but living together, working through their differences instead of using the differences to attack each other.

Without ever being the least bit sappy or manipulative or simplistic, this movie shows what love is: Loving is hard most of the time, and it hurts - a LOT - sometimes, but it's worth every tear and every drop of blood it costs.

This is a fantastic movie. The actors are great, every last one of them (although Allison Torem as Laura is electrifying, the steady, pulsing heart of the movie); the story and dialog are smart without ever seeming to be smart, interesting and entertaining without ever being mindless: just people talking to each other about things that matter to them; and the direction by Stephen Cone - pulling all of this together so beautifully and so powerfully, while writing AND producing AND acting one of the main roles - is just astounding.

I cannot praise this movie highly enough or recommend it enthusiastically enough. It deserves far more recognition than it will ever get.",1372204800,10,1614,4.8545454545454545
8544543,4,B009VL2A4I,"""The Wise Kids"" covers several months in the lives of three teen friends (Brea, Tim, and Laura) who are active in their Southern Baptist church.  As they get ready to depart for college, each has started struggling with their faith in different ways.  Plus, their church's assistant pastor (Austin) has been questioning his sexuality, which has strained his marriage with his sensitive wife (Elizabeth) who clearly has some inkling.

Unfortunately, this micro-budget indie film suffers at time from poor direction.  The director (Stephen Cone, who wrote the screenplay and also plays Austin) relies heavily on long awkward silences between characters to amp up the drama.  So there's many scenes with minimal dialogue and maximal eye darting, sighing, nervous swallowing, and lip biting.  However, what saves this film is its earnestness.  Clearly, Cone cares deeply about this topic and shows a great deal of affection for the various characters, who are fairly rounded and believable.  By the ending, I was genuinely touched, and the film has stuck in my mind for the last several days.",1483228800,,1088,5.212643678160919
8544544,5,B009VL2A4I,"No bad guys here. No bad decisions. Just people growing up--even the adults. Subtle, intelligent performances. A wonderfully written script.
Beautiful directed and photographed. A moving, perceptive film about three teens you might live next door to, who are undergoing crises of faith but come out the better for it. No drugs, sex or teen rebellion here--just a gradual understanding of possibilities and the adventure that life can offer a steady heart and an open mind. Wholeheartedly recommended.",1457395200,3,500,5.423076923076923

Well written and well directed and, by the 3 young leads....so well acted. 3 dear friends in a very religious town are friends as the prospect of college looms they begin to examine what they think and feel too. Laure is the devout religious member of the trio and her faith is unshakable. Brea is having doubts even though her father is a pastor. She is having serious doubts and wants to go to NYU to expand her new horizons. She wants to go to NYU with the 3rd member of the trio and that is Tim who is just coming to terms with the fact that he is gay. Brea is fine with it, needless to say Laura, is not at all. The study and thoughts of these 3 is enthralling. Bravo to all involved.",1442188800,3,756,4.114864864864865
