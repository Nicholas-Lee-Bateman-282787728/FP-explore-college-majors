Holdout in a greasy spoon diner Keven Pollack must make the decision on whether to use nuclear weapons on Bagdad since there's no US force in the area and Uday Hussain is on his way to invading Saudi Arabia. Set in 2007, Saddam is gone replaced by his son and the President is in a tough primary against his opponent Trump! Lots of tension and you'll be at the edge of your seat to see if he can really go through with the use of a nuclear weapon!",1510272000,,627,4.322033898305085
