8075767,5,B000A7PKGC,All of the Dvds arrived on time. They were given as gifts to our grandson and he is a very happy boy!,1358208000,,101,3.6363636363636362
8075768,5,B000A7PKGC,Well everybody loves Raymond so how could you go wrong with this product? Everyone in it is so perfectly cast. It's a classic and one of the funniest sit coms ever. Right up there with Mary Tylor Moore!,1332720000,,202,4.342105263157895
8075769,5,B000A7PKGC,"This is a must buy especially when on sale. I bought all of them for about $15
a season. Non stop laughs. I hated to see it end. RIP Frank we miss you!!!",1264982400,,153,3.6666666666666665
8075770,5,B000A7PKGC,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest shows on TV. Each character is so distinct and will probably remind you of somebody in your own family. Unlike most sitcoms, which seem to take really unrealistic characters and throw them into unrealistic situations, Raymond works taking a normal situation and exaggerating it to show the humor. I pull these DVDs out whenever I need a laugh. They're well worth the cost.",1257206400,,416,4.791666666666667

8075772,1,B000A7PKGC,"I love Everybody Loves Raymond and I'm actually going to buy the entire series after I write this.  DON'T BUY THIS.  The idea for a bulk is that you save by buying them together.  In fact, if you were to buy this combo instead of them all seperately, then you would be paying an extra $24.03.  I don't know about you but $24.03 is a lot of money.

If you're looking to buy the first four seasosn, buy the first three seasons pack and the fourth one by itself.

If you're looking to buy all of the seasons, then buy the first three seasons pack and the rest of the seasons seperately, you save $4 more this way than buying the six seasons pack",1146182400,7,642,4.137096774193548
8075773,5,B000A7PKGC,"If I'm having a bad day, all I do is just put one of these DVDs in and I laugh until I feel better again. Romano just fits the character perfectly, and the dialouge really flows. Plus, the bonus features alone are almost worth the money.

These DVDs can be truly enjoyed by people of all ages. Take me, for example. I'm a fifteen year old guy who listens to punk music, and Everybody Loves Raymond is my favorite show of all time. Some teenagers are afraid to admit it. But everytime I show one of my friends an episode, they end up hooked.

I have all three DVDs and am getting this one the day it comes out, and I know I will end up watching every episode on season 4 until I have the script memorized, I always do. I suggest, if you have any sort of a sense of humor, you pick up at least on of the season box sets. You won't regret it!",1126310400,,839,3.988095238095238
