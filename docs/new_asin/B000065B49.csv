1707628,5,B000065B49,For those who love history & economics this is a must. Commanding Heights takes the viewer from turn of the century Laissez Faire econ to Communism back to a world embracing Hayek and Friedman. Excellent interviews with the relevant economists and government leaders who provide a play by play of such events as the Bolshevik revolution and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Provides excellent insight on the societal and political forces responsible for the current state of the world.,1055894400,9,481,5.025
1707629,5,B000065B49,"What a fantastically informative video series. For those who are hard core economists, this is probably baby stuff for you, but I think there is enough footage of current events around the world, (in Chile, Mexico, etc) that you might find it of interest. I think that this series is aimed at people like my husband and me - hardcore PBS and History Channel watchers who like to learn and are interested in economics, but don't have a deep economics background. This series is fresh and interesting with footage from current newsreels, interviews with world leaders and other area experts. The series also delves into the historical background of many ideas from 20th century economics (Von Hayek versus Keynes anyone?) in a fascinating, informative way. This is an educational video series, and I think that it is more beneficial for people such as myself, with a limited background in economics, but it is delivered in such an interesting and insightful fashion, linking current and recent events (and those from recent decades) of the political world with those of the economic world that it is a pleasure to watch. This will be a series that I will watch numerous times.",1047772800,16,1174,4.9045226130653266

1707633,5,B000065B49,"I have never seen such a comprehensive documentary of global economics.  It carries the audience through the twentieth century from the early days of Progressive-era globalization to World War 1, an event that would destroy global economics until the 1990s.  Keynesian economics, the system of regulating the economy, is addressed, as are the challenges that it brought in the 1970s (stagflation).  It shows how the core of ideas has shifted from control to free markets, from socialism to capitalism.  Now the main challenge in the era of globalization is to work towards a fairer market, one where ""common"" citizens can play an active role in investing, finance, and shareholding.

UPDATE:  As of June 2006, I now consider myself a democratic market-socialist.  I believe that workers should own most medium and big businesses, but trade the products on a relatively free, globalized market.",1021593600,,893,5.246478873239437

This truly exceptional documentary takes an intriguing look at the effect of governmental policy on the markets of the world, and does so while offering excellent historical perspective.  The treatment of political approaches is fair and objective, showing both the positive and negative impact of all types of policy.  However, the clear and undeniable conclusion is that unfettered free markets will provide the most benefit to the most people.

1707670,5,B000065B49,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series and learned a lot from the documentary ! Yes it is concise, but it does weave a story of the Battle of Ideas: Keynesian thought vs the Austrian School. Helps one understand how historical events shaped the evolution of Economic theories. Lots of great interviews with influential people such as Professor Jeffrey Sachs, Bill Clinton, Lee Kuan Yew, Paul Volker, Manmohan Singh and MANY MANY others ! Fascinating case studies about Russia, Bolivia, Chile, India, Thailand, UK, etc etc. It is one thing to just present dry material, but this documentary integrates human stories to bring the material home to many of us. Helps you see that any thought, Economic included, goes through a long period of development, where it can go from guardrail to guardrail (Communism to unfettered Capitalism) to find the sweet spot that would work best for individual societies. I really hope there is an updated version of this documentary that would explain how all these forces brought about the 2008 Financial Crisis. Watching this series makes you want to delve deeper and learn more about the countries examined as well as the various Economic philosophies.
Must see for everyone who is interested in Global economics !!!!! Should be part of the school curriculum !!!!!!!",1356566400,,1294,5.07981220657277

In addition to a good reporting and exposition of key concepts, ideas, schools of thought and events that have shaped our world economically and politically, some rare and intimate interviews with influential figures of the 20th century afford a good insight into who and what made them so.  Pleasurable viewing and worth all time and money invested.

1707672,4,B000065B49,"I am through two of the videos and am so thankful that I finally found a documentary that both explains the basics of the economic theories of Keynes and Hayak and the practical global history of those theories put into practice.  The subject of Macroeconomics has both intrigued me and intimidated me over the past several years.  I am not the quickest reader so many of the works associated with the great economists have seemed overwhelming.  Before jumping into these more scholarly and foundational books I was wanting a broader understanding and outline.  I have found that with Commanding Heights.  I may have to come back and adjust this review based on the third disc, but I have found the history of these theories play out in the past century both engaging and enlightening.  Because of my age and lack of interest at the time, I never knew what was taking place beneath all the global turmoil of the 80s and 90s.  Now I have a much better understanding.

The one down side to this documentary is its age.  It was made in 2002 so all of the economic upheaval we have experienced the past decade and specifically the past 5 years is not addressed. However, what I have learned in Commanding Heights will help me to better understand the present economic issues more accurately as well.

Additionally, my boys are 8 and 9 and I can't wait to sit down with them, with their growing love for the history and world affairs and help teach them about economic theory.  These videos will be an incredible aid in that process.

***********************************

Well I just watched the third and final episode of the series and what was a great macroeconomic overview and history of global economics over the past century turned into a back and forth supporting the protests of the WTO in the late 90s and early 21st century.

It is presented in an engaging way with interviews with many of the key players of the late twentieth century (Gorbachev, Thatcher, Reagan, Cheney, Friedman). They actually manage to make economics interesting. It is a little biased towards the free-market and they don't spend enough time analysing the flaws of the market other than the periodic crashes. But even with this flaw it is a tremendous achievement. Highly recommended.",1288310400,,620,5.148514851485149
1707696,5,B000065B49,"""Commanding Heights"" gives a balanced look at Keynesian planned economies and Hayek's free market. While economics may not be the most entertaining subject for a film, this series does a good job of showing examples of economies on real people. The fallout from government controlled markets is described over and over. Each DVD is packed with interviews of politicians and economists. I found Milton Friedman to be especially interesting. This movie also inspired me to pick up a copy of Hayek's The Road to Serfdom. The recent collapse of the Asian economies is documented on disk 3 and is an eerie foreboding of our current economic downturn. I've recommended these DVDs to my coworkers so we can talk about the global financial crisis with knowledge of recent economic history.

1707697,4,B000065B49,"Free markets or central planning?  Hayek or Keynes?

I have seen this documentary a couple of times since it came out and found it very informative and absorbing for it's world historical/economic/political perspective.  I should say, I never look to just one source of information no matter how persuasive.

I brought it out again yesterday to watch in particular Part 3 which brought the film to it's then current times during the GW Bush administration, just after 9/11, the Seattle Summit demonstrations, and after the market collapses of Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and Russia. This film was so pertinent, it could have very easily just continued on to the 2007/2008 US and world economic collapse and the devastation and adjustments that we are still living with today right up to the Summit demonstrations in Toronto.

I highly recommend this film.

1707698,2,B000065B49,"I was waiting to read a review from someone with the basic understanding of who is truly in control of the world's economics. Propaganda at its' best here. Why did PBS hide the fact that ENRON was a major contributor to this series? Did they think that the sheople couldn't handle the truth? Though filled with facts, many are skewed. It is made for sheople entertainment and the dumbing-down of the masses. This is how governments brainwash even the most brilliant scholars from seeing the truth that is right in front of their noses! I spoke recently with an award-winning economist from Princeton University who refused to acknowledge that our Federal Reserve is nothing but a private banking cartel. Very scary.
If you can handle the truth, read G. Edward Griffin's `The Creature from Jekyll Island'.

Then i read the reviews that this documentary had , based on the book. I thought the premise was really interesting. So i bought it, and i watched it. I didn't feel ripped off after, and i still watch it! (and in fact bought another set for my sister)

This is truly the best analytical documentary ever devised. It is such a piece of art, it stands on its own and has no other real similar.

I read other reviews and i concurr that sometimes it seems as if the analysis doesn't go deep enough. BUt that's the beauty of the narration.

Sachs took the position that all the government owned factories should be cut loose without any subsidies for retooling, reorganization, getting rid of Russian poison pills such as having almost every Polish factory stuck with subcontractors across the Soviet bloc. The consequence of Sachs' expert advice was the loss of most of the skills of the rather skilled Polish work force. In one factory towns, all salaries disappeared driving people to live off tiny agricultural plots. Many skilled workers were reduced to rural proletarians. Of course, these touted neocons and neolibs are not conservative in any traditional sense of the term conservatism. They pretend to be Reaganauts but they are much closer to the bureaucrats of the old Empire of Evil.

It is a captivating, yet one-sided and ultimately imbalanced story of ideas in economic theory - Keynes vs. Hayek - which recalls to mind the chutzpah in the title of the book ""How Pepsi Won the Cola Wars"".

My take is that it is, in the end, a fabulously produced propaganda piece created by those with a financial or ideological interest in promulgating totally free-market thinking as represented by the series poster boy, Friederich Hayek.

I watched it 3 years ago when it was presented intially on PBS.

Margaret Thatcher battles against uneconomic coal mining (the supposed ""commanding heights"" of the economy owned by the government at the time) and puts them out of work amid protests.  Over and over, the films show that price fixing does not work, and that free trade also works.

1707747,3,B000065B49,"It was hard to rate this documentary in terms of stars because it is very informative and it presents a clear narrative of the ""death of Communism (and managed economies)"" and ""rebirth and vindication of free-market Capitalism.""  It also makes some compelling, well-reasoned, arguments, which are supported with clear, concrete examples.  However, it does not tell the whole story (as no historical narrative can), and in that way has some serious omissions.

The ""official story"" of the evolution of economic theory presented in this documentary is the following: During the middle of the twentieth century, particularly after the disillusionments of the Great Depression and World War II, the West preferred the theories of John Maynard Keynes (reducing the injustices of Capitalism through ""controlled"" economies) while the East (the Soviet Union and its satellites and China) turned to all out Communism.  While Friedrich Hayek, a free-market capitalist a la Adam Smith, did his best to argue against these theories, the general prosperity of the post-war period in the West made his ideas unappealing and irrelevant.  Then, with the economic crisis of the 1970's  (stagflation in the US, paralyzing strikes in Britain), the theories of Hayek, and his followers, like Milton Friedman from the University of Chicago, found a voice in Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.  By cutting taxes and spending, controlling inflation, and in the case of Britain, privatizing the commanding heights (major industries) of the national economy, economic prosperity returned.  This knowledge was then applied in other countries with great success.  While it has not all been rosy, it is the most promising system.

I say this documentary makes some compelling arguments because it convinced me of the failure of managed economies where the central government controls the major means of production, sets prices, etc.  The reality is that the laws of supply and demand work despite such efforts (which we see in the formation of black markets).  Furthermore government controlled economies work less efficiently than free-markets (i.e., cause shortages, provide no motivation for hard work and risk-taking, etc.).

However, this documentary did not convince me that government intervention in the form of progressive taxation, social programs and laws protecting workers has failed.  In fact, the documentary briefly talks about how well Germany's economy did after WWII because it got rid of price control and did not nationalize its commanding heights.  However, Germany is a European welfare state with progressive taxation, and lots of social programs, and it has done very well.  I know laissez-faire types insist that the US economy is much stronger than the Western European economies (higher GDP, lower unemployment), but this depends on how you analyze the situation.  Yes, Europe has higher unemployment, but that's because they provide a living wage.  As a result, they don't have the problem of large numbers of working poor.  In the US, on the other hand, we have lower unemployment but millions of people who work and cannot support themselves.  Also, GDP says nothing about how that wealth is distributed within a country.  In the US 1% of the population owns 50% of the wealth, in Europe the wealth is distributed more equally and, according to recent studies, there is much more social mobility than in the US.

My main problem with this documentary are its omissions regarding:

1) The portrayal of Reaganomics.  Reagan, like our current president, was not a fiscal conservative; he relied heavily on deficit spending; he increased the national debt more than any president before him (of course Bush II has now outdone him).  He continued to spend heavily on the military, while cutting taxes, as a way to strengthen the economy.  Thus, you could argue that he was a Keynesian (although Keynes had hoped that the economic recovery caused by governmental spending during WWII, could be achieved ""without"" war and/or excessive military buildup).  Conservatives like to ignore the fact that the military is a huge (and I would say wasteful) government program comprising about 1/2 of the federal budget.  It is also hard to truly gauge the success of Reagan's policies since it has not fallen upon us pay back any of the debt.  We continue to borrow heavily, while cutting taxes, to finance our dubious military adventures overseas, Iraq being the most recent example.  But, as the documentary itself tells us, the fall of the Soviet Union was due largely to their spending half of their federal budget on the military.  A similar situation brought about the fall of the Spanish empire.  So, what is going to happen to us?

2) Other factors that contribute to economic prosperity.  Economic theory is just one factor related to the West's economic prosperity.  Another important one is our cheap access to the natural resources of developing nations.  The United States has used its military and CIA to install and/or support brutal regimes and oligarchies in order to ensure our access to the resources of these countries.  These governments have terrorized and exploited their populations, while making cozy deals with US companies for their own personal enrichment.  There is plenty of information on this (any decent history book should do), but for a good general overview of this specific theme, I recommend Stephen Kinzer's new book: ""Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq.""  In this country we conveniently forget that in order for everyone on the planet to consume at the levels we do, we would need two other planets, just to provide the natural resources.  Our standard of living is clearly dependent on our ""advantage"" over the so-called ""third world.""  Furthermore, their remaining in the ""developing"" phase is also helpful to our economy since that way they have to buy our products but we don't have to buy theirs.  It's interesting to see that when the tables are turned (i.e., the current trade deficit with China), classical liberal economic theory starts to lose a lot of supporters in the US.  Thus, despite all the talk about improving the plight of the poor (5/6ths of the world's population), there is no honest discussion about what that would really mean for the West, and whether or not we are really willing to give up our ""economic advantage.""  Free market capitalism is great as long as we are on the winning side.

3) Chile.  This is an egregious case of whitewashing history.  The story is presented as follows: The right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet, overall did Chile a service by overthrowing the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in a coup.  After the overthrow, the kind-hearted, freedom-loving Milton Friedman decided to go down to Chile and give Pinochet some private lessons on free-market economics.  Pinochet adopted these measures and Chile lived happily ever after as the most prosperous country in Latin America.

The documentary claims that the Pinochet regime disappeared ""hundreds of people,"" yet by the most conservative figures, six thousand political dissidents were disappeared (secretly abducted, tortured, and murdered).  This documentary also makes no mention of the US involvement in the coup: since Allende wanted to nationalize copper, and other major industries controlled largely by US companies (ITT, Pepsi Cola, Kennecott Copper, etc.), Nixon and Kissinger decided to overthrow him.  And, while it was true that Chile was undergoing serious economic problems under Allende, this was largely due to Nixon's strategy to crush Allende by making the Chilean ""economy scream.""  For more on our involvement in the Chilean coup I recommend the last two sections of the documentary ""The Trials of Henry Kissinger"" (or you can read Hitchen's book by the same title).  Costa Gavras's film ""Missing,"" as well as documentaries by Patricio Guzm'n (""The Pinochet Case,"" ""The Battle of Chile: The Struggle of an Unarmed People,"" and ""Chile, Obstinate Memory"") also give moving accounts of Pinochet's reign of terror.  Milton Friedman is shocked that people protested his receiving the Nobel Prize in economics because of his collusion with the Pinochet regime.  He even has the gall to say that his reforms brought democracy back to Chile (16 years after we destroyed it!!!).  Following this logic, the new socialist president, Michelle Bachelet, is also a result of his (failed?) free market policies.

4) Bolivia.  This story is presented as follows: The well-known Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs goes down to Bolivia, one of the poorest country in Latin America, to help the Bolivians control hyperinflation with some free-market policies.  His policies are a success.  And it's even more wonderful because they didn't even need to install a bloody dictator to do it.  Reality: While this documentary was being made, Bolivians were risking their lives rioting in the streets against these policies, particularly the privatization of water by Bechtel (apparently destitute Bolivians didn't like having to pay Bechtel in order to collect rain water in a bucket).  Two presidents were removed from office, several people were killed and hundreds were injured.  The people were also calling for the nationalization of Bolivia's natural gas.  This widespread grassroots movement brought the left-wing Evo Morales to power through free and fair elections in 2006.  One of the first things Morales did was nationalize the natural gas industry.  Why?  Because Bolivians want more money from ""their"" natural resources to go to them, and not to private foreign companies.  Perhaps government control of this industry isn't the ideal situation, but government is the only tool that this nation had to wrest some of its wealth out of the hands of foreign corporations.  If we are honest, we have to admit that Americans and Europeans would never tolerate foreign industries reaping the vast majority of the profits from our natural resources.  We wouldn't like free-market economics so much if Latin Americans were getting rich off our natural resources as we continued to live in utter poverty.

5) IMF, World Bank and WTO.  This documentary doesn't explain how neo-liberal economic policies have been forced on the poor countries, with devastating effects.  In return for supplying loans the IMF and the World Bank demand from their creditor nations that they cut public spending (including on their military), eliminate and/or reduce tariffs, and promote foreign investment and property rights.  Rather than helping these countries, these policies help the West secure its dominance over them.  For example, by requiring poor countries to eliminate tariffs that protect the few domestic products they produce while continuing to protect ours, we give ""our"" products an unfair advantage.  Also, by promoting foreign investment we ensure that most of these countries' wealth remain in foreign hands. And while the required cuts in public spending often result in fewer social programs, reduced educational opportunities, more environmental pollution, and greater poverty for the vast majority of people, the loans they receive in return are often pocketed by multinational corporations and the country's elite with little ever reaching the people (see John Perkins's ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man "").  It is hypocritical to insist poor countries simply cut all deficit and social spending when we do not carry out such extreme measures in our own countries.  If all of a sudden we had to make cuts like these, there would be public outrage.  Furthermore, requiring cuts in military spending is clearly a way to maintain military dominance over these countries.  For more on the devastating effects of neo-liberal (free market) policies enforced by the IMF, World Bank and WTO, I recommend the documentary ""Life and Debt"" (about Jamaica).

6) Corporations.  Classical liberal economists (like Thatcher, Reagan and Friedman in this documentary) love to insist that private property is an essential part of freedom; they claim the two go hand in hand.  When you own something, it's yours and you can do what you want with it; you are not subject to the will of others.  I agree with this argument, to some extent.  The problem is the tendency towards the concentration of wealth within free-market economies.  Sure, it's great that the small business owner can control what happens within his/her business, or if a home owner can decide what to do with his/her house (rather than the state), but when the CEOs of huge multi-national corporations, with GDP's bigger than those of most nations, can do whatever they want, we have tyranny of the corporation, not freedom of the individual, and certainly not democracy.  For example, if Wal-Mart, one of the biggest employers in the US, decides not to pay overtime and not to promote women, they are ""free"" to do so, unless the government intervenes.  But, if we remove government restraints on business, regular citizens are left with no means to fight back.  ""Big government"" may not be ideal, but at least it is somewhat responsible to the people; corporations are not.  Thus, it is incorrect to frame the debate as a choice ""for"" or ""against"" individual freedom.  The real choice is: are we going to defend the right of big corporations to do as they please or the basic human rights of the ""little guy""?  It is also necessary to mention the pernicious effects big companies have on ""democracy"" as well.  Their huge campaign contributions to politicians give them disproportionate influence over elected officials; there is a reason why Bush invited Ken Lay (""Kenny Boy"" from Enron) to the White House, but he did not invite you and me.  For more on the current tyranny of the multi-national corporation, I recommend the documentary ""The Corporation.""

It is callousness and hubris of the worst kind to say the current free-market economy offers ""the best we can do.""  Twenty thousand people continue to die every day from starvation or lack of access to basic medicines even though there is more than enough food and medicine to feed and care for every person on the planet.  Some women who work in the garment industries in developing nations have to wear diapers because their employers will not let them go to the bathroom.  Workers in underdeveloped nations that protest their inhuman working conditions are frequently threatened, tortured and/or killed.  Corporations are not being held responsible for the destruction of the environment they are causing, which will have devastating effects for all of humanity.  And the US continues to use its military to secure its hold on important natural resources in developing nations (i.e., oil in Iraq and Colombia) at the cost of its citizens.  Faced with issues like these (which were not emphasized in this documentary), should we really just say: ""Hayek got it right and we're currently living in the best of all possible worlds""?",1149120000,39,15028,5.201495637723307
1707748,5,B000065B49,"If anyone is still in doubt about the virtues of the Free Market this is a must-see DVD. Watch as the 20th Century unfolds and unravells as virtually every socialist state collapses under the disasterous theory that the State can effectively control the market. How did Germany suddenly revive itself straight after WWII when the allies continued to struggle? How did Poland and South America pull back from the abyss of bankruptcy and tackle their hyper-inflation caused by Keynesian economics?

""Commanding Heights"" is a fantastic walk across the plains upon which The Austrian Economists finally beat the well-intentioned but flawed thinking of Keynes. It is a brilliant documentary about the battle of two ideas: Keynes' theory of a State Controlled Economy; and the Austrians who advocated the Free Market.

Anyone who still backs Keynes after watching this DVD series is either mad or a politician who wants the power to control your business - and ultimately you.

Viewing all 6 hours simply is a short class that fosters a newfound respect for the long-term thinking exhibiting by Reagan, Thatcher, etc.

The political risks that pro-free-market leaders take is seen when simplistic protestors take to the streets, unable to see beyond their immediate political agendas.

I also have a new admiration for PBS in producing this honest assessment of the battle of ideas over the past half century.

What is this mysterious ""market"" and what are it's real characteristics? How do we bridge the languages of economics and politics to predict or plan the future?

1707768,3,B000065B49,"Do you remember being caught by surprise and totally baffled, way back in November 1999, upon seeing ""Battle for Seattle"" on CNN?  You remember, that time all those protesters wreaked havoc on the World Trade Organization meeting?

Do you remember asking yourself what all those kids were so angry about, and what the WTO and the World Bank were really up to?  In short, suddenly needing to catch up on all the stuff you had been missing?

Well, if you've always wanted clear explanations of these issues, you ain't gonna get them from this DVD set.

...not that it's not worth watching or buying.  There is a lot in it that you will probably find interesting and informative.

Take, for example, the first DVD, which largely recounts the theoretical divisions between the competing economic philosophies of von Hayek and Keynes.  This part of the series is very well-done and lays out complicated ideas in a super-clear visual way.

However, as the series unfolds, it becomes obvious that it is not living up to its early promise, while all the time hinting (as such documentaries are won't to do) that full revelation lies just around the corner.

For example, the first disk, as I say, does a swell job delineating the differences between Hayek's and Keynes's philosophies.  However, although the narration makes it clear that toward the end of the century, Hayek's theories were finally coming into their own, they never really explain why.

They explain Hayek's theories as, essentially, that government should avoid vigorous taxing/spending policies, as this imperils our freedom.  Fine.

But later, when his theories have gained the ascendancy, we're left to wonder why.  How exactly were supply-sideism and Reaganomics endangering our freedom?  Despite the slick images, you will find the discussion behind them, if you carefully chart it through the 3 disks, to be vapid and incoherent.

But the images are slick, that's for sure.  They obviously spent a lot of money here and went through a lot of trouble to get even minor shots just right.

But when it comes to explaining globalism, I have to say this series doesn't do such a swell job.  I got a lot out of watching the series, but not because of its discussion of that topic.

Take the Seattle thing.  All we see is some footage of protesters making trouble, and the indignant WTO officials claiming they've got them all wrong.  Meanwhile the narrator blandly describes what we're seeing on the screen.

How hard would it have been for the filmmakers to get some activists to talk to them and inquire, ""Why are you doing this?  What's you're argument?  How exactly do you think the WTO is ruining the world?""

Similarly, they could have gotten WTO officials to sit down and articulate precisely how it was that they were saving the world, and how all the assertions of the masked hordes outside were baseless and counterproductive.

But at no point does the narration ever get this informative.

Instead, all we are told is that globalism is controversial.  Duh.  At no point is either side invited to side down and really explain their position at length.  So all the viewer gets, essentially, is some cool riot footage.

So whether you are with the protestors, the WTO, or in the middle, you will be disappointed by the uselessness of the attendant ""discussion.""  Like I say, if you're really looking for some solid information on why globalism is such a thorny issue (rather than just being told it's a thorny issue), you won't get it here.  By about the middle of the third disk, it's become clear that the writers really dropped the ball on what could have been an awesome and mind-bending series.

Instead, this series has all the trappings of excellence, without the real pearl at the bottom.

However, if you're an economics teacher, you should probably get this series anyways.  There are, despite what I say, many strengths (the segment with DeSoto springs to mind).  Besides, how many entertaining (and, with the abovestated reservations, generally well-done) economics videos do you know of?

The second video is my favorite as it traces the rise and fall of different national economies such as Russia, Poland, India, Bolivia. It is a very engaging inside look at what happened in these countries. The interviews are particularily interesting and insightful.

1707770,5,B000065B49,"How can a couple cranky economists in their ivory towers change the world?  Commanding Heights provides the answer, with a sweeping view of 20th century economic history.  The name comes from ""the Commanding Heights of the Economy"" - big industry.  The story is of the global fight for control of it - public versus private.  We live in a society where free markets are assumed to be the only alternative (if not an ideal one) but history could have proved otherwise.

The story centers around the ideas of two great economists, Hayek and Keynes.  Keynes, whose belief in the importance of government intervention helps the world out of the Great Depression, is the champion of the 30s and 40s.  This was when leaders believed that government could successfully plan and manage the Commanding Heights.  By the end of the century, Hayek is the unquestioned victor.  While his harsh economic policies (let things fix themselves) seemed awful in the 30s, time has borne them out to be the right solution for our time.

The story also highlights on some of the failures and bumps in the road.  While Chile provided enormous support for the ideas of Hayek, the human cost was staggering.  The social cost of reform in Russia was also much greater than anyone anticipated.  The markets are choppy and unpredictable, and that is part of the lesson.

Interviews are presented with many of the politicians (Bill Clinton & Margaret Thatcher) and economists (Milton Friedman, Hernando de Soto and Sam Peltzman) that drove these changes.  It is hard to imagine a more dull topic than economic history, but these CDs really do make the story come alive.",1108252800,7,1640,4.870036101083032
1707771,4,B000065B49,"When I first heard of this documentary it piqued my interest that such an ambitious and timely program existed. A quick background on me - I recently returned (2 months ago) from 7 months straight of traveling (Loop around Australia, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Philippines, Palau, Hong Kong, Qatar, UAE, London/Oxford) which was a follow up to a 3 month road trip around most of the US and 6 weeks in South America and 2 weeks in China. I'm still going!  One of my travel themes has been to visit where things are made or processed, and where they come from - a critical aspect of globalization. From the tea plantations in Sri Lanka to the mixing & packaging of that tea from Sri Lanka and 50+ other countries for Celestial Seasonings in Boulder, CO, USA (Did you know there is only 1 tea plantation in the US? And they went bankrupt recently). Or the Silicon Valley of India - Bangalore - as shown in the movie, or strip coal mining in Gilette, Wyoming, the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo, or the natural gas reserve rich deserts of Qatar, etc..

Like any documentary or book there is a perspective. The show does a good job of framing the debate. It covers the perspectives of many different influential individuals and some lay people - and in many different countries to boot - lending an air of authority - which is fine as an explanation for the documentary's position. It does provide coverage to both positives and negatives.

However, my sense is that the show is far too positive about what unrestrained globalization will bring us. Not about the process to get to a ""free"" market  - as shown in the ""Agony of Reform"" episode, but about the side effects to our lives and the world in which a large portion of the world lives in.

Also what is a ""free"" market? There is no such thing. The movie seems to keep repeating it only in reference to price and wage controls (From what I recall), but these can be controlled in other manners. Subsidies galore in the USA and other countries both direct and indirect will testify to that.

There are certainly other issues it does not address or go deep enough into and/or issues that are overly simplified. Perhaps that will be the work of another individual to reveal - me?

The #1 issue to me that the show does not talk more about or at all is the continuing disconnect between the items we consume and where the resources it takes to build those items/services come from and the impact it has on those places. Only lightly touched upon in the final episode. Realistically - the vast majority of people don't care about what they cannot / have not seen (Thus the importance of travel). Let alone understand how a series of events in a far away place will impact their lives. We can't get something for nothing. Globalization gives that impression. Like magic. The further away we are from production - the less we see the side effects. Like pollution clouds from runaway unregulated growth and auto sales in China (Go to Beijing for one) reaching distant shores - US, among a small list of many.

Don't get me wrong - the idea of globalizatoin improving our lives is true - but only to a certain point. Any idea taken to its extreme is usually wrong.

In contrast to this latter point might be how Singapore has restricted the unbridled usage of cars by putting a heavy import tax on them and designing cities in an intelligent way rather than haphazard (Like many American towns). As Singapore is profiled in the show as a success story - is this tax against the idea of a ""free"" market? Or is it a conscious choice to improve the quality of life and form it a certain way.

In summary, Commanding Heights - both the PBS website and video is a good basis for ongoing discussion. The only question will be then is whether the people / you who watch it will question it or take it as gospel. It is easy to get caught up and distort our vision in the momentum of thinking a certain way.  All of us - rich, poor, middle, smart, educated, not educated, etc.. can be conditioned to believe anything.  What's that story about De Beers of South Africa and the diamond trade again?

The truth and our behaviors are easily distorted to the unquestioning mind.

I *highly* recommend Waste Land: Meditations on a Ravaged Landscape by Davis Hanson (On Amazon) a book that shows aerial and ground level photos of 75+ US EPA Superfund sites, coal mining in Montana, and US Minuteman missle sites. You will discover that 'wastelands', as depicted in Commanding Heights of the oil industry mess and uncleaned up contamination in Russia, is far from unique to Communism. Rather than being unique in this aspect, unrestrained capitalism looks very much the same.

Also the small and easy to read - Stuff: The Secret Lives of Everyday Things by John Ryan and Alan Durning to give you an idea of the extent of globalization with everyday products you use.

For the video minded I *HIGHLY* recommend these DVDs - Life and Debt (Jamaica), Charcoal People (Brazil-cars-rainforest), Orwell Rolls in His Grave (Global media), End of Suburbia (Peak oil), and National Geographic's Strange Days on Planet Earth and Taboo Season One and Two.",1089417600,175,5203,4.6147186147186146
1707772,2,B000065B49,"The only reason this video gets 2 stars (and not a complete zero) is because it does a decent job of explaining (some) aspects of post-WWII economic history that are almost completely unknown to the vast majority of Americans - even though such information should be taught in grade school (at least, if this was truly a free and democratic republic). A good example is the contrast between Keynesian and Austrian (Hayek) economics.
The reason the video is -- in all other respects -- an almost complete failure is b/c of the way in which words, facts and figures are twisted so as to sell the banker's nirvana of global capitalism. A good example is the fact (left unstated in the video) that Keynesian economics is little more than Communism w/ a friendly, happy British face (widely known, in polite society, as Fabian Socialism). Another good example is the depiction of the Thatcher/Reagan ""Revolution"" as Austrian in nature. Of course it wasn't -- deficit spending and fiat money (which is basically how one should characterize the 1980s) are anethema to Austrian economices, but the video never makes mention of this fact. There is a world of difference between the Austrian libertarians like von Mises and the Chicago monetarists (like Freidman and Schultz) who are deified in the video.
If you want a real dose of Austrian economics, check out Texas Representative Ron Paul -- he's probably the only one in Washington preaching sound fiscal policy these days.
There is another path to true economic prosperity - it's called the American Way. It was ""invented"" by German-American economist Friedrich List back in the early 19th century. It was List's model that was responsible for the post-Revolutionary succcess of the US, for the rapid industrialization of Germany in the late 19th century, and for Japan's economic success post-WWII.
And it's no coincidence that the video producers fail to make any mention of List. The agenda they choose to push instead is a globalist, one-world government under the rule of an unaccountable banking elite. Just look at who paid for the video in the credits at the end if you need any proof.

1707773,4,B000065B49,"For those who want an introduction to international economics and globalization, this is the thing to see. I agree with what the Washington Post said - ""No more important program for making sense of our life and times has been seen in at least a decade."" It made me want to be an economist.
In the first segment, it covers the development of economic theory through Keynes, Hayek, and Friedman, and the historic solutions and events between the war of 1914 and the 1970s, ending with the change of tack that accompanied Reagan and Thatcher's elections. In the second, it follows the ""agony of reform"" - that is, the paths taken by many states to transition from planned economies to market economies, following the cases of Russia, Poland, Chile, and Bolivia. The last segment follows the contemporary problems and methods of the global economy, with particular focus on crisis: mainly, the 1998 Asian Economic Crisis.
It is important to remember that this documentary is about economics, and that its concern is about the quality and quantity of wealth generated rather than externalities (the environment, &c.) Taken in this context, I think that it does extremely well: anyone who knows at least a little will leave the show literate in global economics. It does have a certain pro-globalization stint to it, though I hardly find that it is outright dismissive of globalization's criticisms: the second half of the third segment is entirely about arguments against globalization, and the first half of that segment is entirely about the crises that have rocked the global economy. And, after all, Jeffrey Sachs and Bill Clinton are two of their biggest commentators, who are at least pragmatic globalists (If the writers favor any viewpoint, it's Clinton and Sachs'). That said, I think that this is probably the least biased (or, most centrist, depending on your point of view) documentary on globalization in existence - the others you'll find will almost without exception skew more than this one will. Not to mention that its cast of commentators and the ability of its filmmakers are excellent, and something that's normally very dry is made really entertaining.
There are some things that it probably does leave out more: it doesn't give the criticisms of the IMF and World Bank really, particularly those that come from the right and business, which is somewhat peculiar. This might be because of center-left bias (think Bill Clinton) that rather likes these multilateral institutions, or because they just ran out of time, which seems pretty likely - they had to cram into the two hours that those issues would make sense in information about three global crises, the methods of modern international finance, two meetings of the WTO, and Hernando de Soto.
The other thing they somewhat miss is what happened to Bolivia, Argentina and some of the other Latin American countries ""after"" globalization who ended up trashed by economic currents. Part of this is because many of these events happened or came to be examined after the series aired, but I think that in their search for an emblematic case they found a pretty good one: the case of Thailand, which was one fo those countries that got ""trashed"" in 1998 - they provide a particularly stirring personal anecdote of one businessman who lost everything in the crisis on real estate, and is now working his way back up to his dreams as a street vendor. The thing is that they don't link this to Thailand's development as a globalizing economy (that is, Thailand isn't covered in section 2.) so we don't make the intuitive connection between globalization and increased economic risk.
The third thing that concerns me is that they did not cover the ""moderate"" paths to globalization experienced in France, Ukraine and Germany, or the successful totalitarian export economies of South Korea or Thailand. Again, I think this is because they ran out of time: the emblems of Chile and India almost get at these ideas, and the importantly but not strikingly different paths taken by the countries I listed were close enough that the viewer could infer the important insights. I suppose I'll have to read the book to see if that covers those alternate paths any better.
That's my take on the program's shortcomings - I think that they faced the problem that they could either cover all subjects, remain aloof from any accusations of bias, but say really nothing about anything, or they could (as they did) stab deeply at a number of emblematic cases and avoid some things that they saw as low-priority. This of course came at cost, but by far I think that this is something that everyone should see - I think they should show it to students, as they'd certainly leave knowing a thing or two about the founders of modern economics and how foreign exchange works. Hell, they might even know what short selling is...

1707785,5,B000065B49,"This is a powerful and persuasive presentation of 20th century economics.  The presenters lean heavily towards the Hayekian model of economics development, which is controversial and not without its many detractors.  Many critics of Hayek are given space to present their respective arguments, but one gains the overall impression that the weight of the arguments leans heavily in favour of Hayek's approach of an unfettered market driven economy.
Critics of Hayekian model of economics development (which includes those who oppose economic globalisation and trade liberalisation) would do well to watch the documentary, and note the key strengths of Hayek's model of economic development, thereby refining their criticisms of the current trend towards market liberalisation.  Believers in ""rational econoomics"" would do well to consider the damaging side effects an unfettered market economy would have on the environment, and present a model of economic development that is both sustainable and ecnomically viable.

1707786,4,B000065B49,"This documentary is meant to put the major economic doctrines and ideologies of the 20th century within their historic contexts. In this it succeeds beautifully.
The Keynsian revolution in the West and the rise of Socialism in the East followed by the rise of the Austrian school and the Friedmanite refutation of Keynesian thought and finally a reappraisal of Post-Keynesian doctrine. This was the reality of the 20th century and this documentary gives a good overview.
This documentary is not a critique of those doctrines, merely an analysis.  If you have even a cursory interest in economics and how theory moves into the real world, this is definitely for you.
If, however, you have an axe to grind (left or right) this will not satisfy your needs as it only gives the facts as they presented themselves within their times.
I state again, if you want a philosophical dissection and/or a critical theoretical analysis of Capitalism or Socialism (and the theoretical underpinnings of each) then this is NOT the place to look.  This is an analysis of 20th century Capitalism and to a lesser degree Socialism that works from an acceptance that both doctrines were an historical reality.

1707787,1,B000065B49,"Welcome to the fantasy realm of ""free trade,"" where capitalism is nothing but a source of wealth and political freedom.  In this video you will be treated to the finest hallucinogens. Here, Reagan, Thatcher, the IMF, and the World Bank are god-like heroes, spreading prosperity and freedom around the globe.
Overlooked is the fact that over the last 50 years, the IMF and World Bank have brought hunger, misery, and dependence to the third world.  Overlooked is the fact that 3 billion humans live on a dollar a day!  These people are suppossedly the great beneficiaries of ""free trade.""
It's worse than ignorant to speak so uncritically of ""free trade:"" it's to collude with famine, AIDS, child labor, and poverty.  It's to ignore and apologize for dictatorships (Pinochet is lovingly portrayed), to forget that Reagan's Contras slaughtered 30,000 in Nicaragua and made it the poorest place in Latin America, and to forget that the U.S., France, Germany, and Japan got rich as slavers and colonial powers.  It's to forget that Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong improved their lot through protectionism, state education, and planned economies.
If you loved Reagan, you'll love this video.  It requires the kind of dementia and amnesia that Reagan suffers from to celebrate these myths.  But if you want to truly learn about the global economy, including the pros and the cons of capitalism, you have to look elsewhere.  You need to read Joseph Stiglitz, Mike Davis, Vandana Shiva, and others.  Until then, you will be living in the fantasy-land of rich White men.",1069977600,31,1558,5.007751937984496
1707788,3,B000065B49,"This 3-part series is an ambitious attempt to chart the struggle between major economical ideas that have animated state-level policies for about 100 years. The Bolshevik Revolution, planned economy, Depression, war economies, Keynes, The Austrian School and later The Chicago School (Hayek, respectively Friedman), Thatcher and Reagan, Clinton and globalization are some of the characters/doctrines/ideologies marking the storyline. For a more than adequate presentation, check out the PBS website and run a search for Commanding Heights (pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/).
The style is highly journalistic, several video-inserts seem to come straight from some newscast, the rhythm is alert, and content is highly edited.

However, to achieve more one either knows a great deal apriori (history of economic ideas, contemporary and modern history and politics, etc.) or considers this material only as an open challenge and, for example, follows the Internet pointers scattered throughout the material. Knowing already about the covered topics reduces the value of this series to that of matching faces--provided that one doesn't get overly irritated by the patronizing editing or by the factual shortcuts.",1069545600,10,1472,5.756880733944954
1707789,5,B000065B49,"Many great thoughts have been expressed here regarding the DVD version of ""Commanding Heights"".
As a Professor of Economics, I do of course echo much of the same enthusiasm for the seamless integration of economics, sociology, anthropology, politics, and philosophy -- i.e. political economy -- however, my primary praise for this series has little to do with economics directly.  IMO, it's great achievement is that it successfully animates the ""power of ideas"" within human history.
Marx, Keynes, Hayek, Friedman, et al, were people of ideological ideas, and if this series does anything, it truly projects the ""creatively destructive"" nature of ideas, and the often present irony of how these ideas are usually taken far beyond the original intent of their creators.  For instance, it is doubtful Marx would be a Marxian as Marxism is known today.  Ditto with Keynes and modern Keynesians?  Likewise, Smith would be frightened by some of today's far-right who pay him lip-service.
Perhaps Keynes unknowingly reviewed this series best:
"". . . the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.  Indeed the world is ruled by little else.  Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.  Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.""
(The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money).
If I have any complaint with it, it would be it seems too short and slightly biased towards ""Keynesian"" thought.  But, some bias is expected in such endeavors, and perhaps my own libertarian ideology has biased my own judgment here?
In any event, it is NOT ideological dogma, and is certainly a worthwhile series that does justice to the ideas it chronicles in an acceptably fair and honest manner.

Those who claim that globalisation has only widened the gap between the have's and have-not's can see that it is not a zero sum game.  While the forces of supply and demand may cause hardship in the short run, over time, these same forces create stronger, more properous economies.

1) No mention of productivity and its importance
2) Very little mention of competition policy (anti-monopoly). Competition is what drives productivity and quality improvements.
3) Little mention of the level of corruption in many third world countries. IMF loans go to dictator's Swiss bank accounts.

I have only one complaint. Historical overviews such as this one do not provide hard numbers about trends in the distribution of the world's output across peoples and nations. So there is no way to settle disputes - you have liberals against conservatives, free-traders against protectionists, and so on, with no definitive facts to settle the underlying issue of whether the world's growth is benefitting or hurting the poor. (Virtually everyone agrees that the world's economic growth is benefitting the rich.) Protestors against the World Trade Organization in Seattle and elsewhere railed against globalization because globalization is thought to hurt the poor. Does it? To find out we need good data and careful analysis. The best book I know on the subject is The New Geography of Global Income Inequality. It's expensive, but worth it, for people who really want to know the facts about whether in today's world the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.

7961277,3,B000065B49,"Looking back, the End of History as identified by the thinker Francis Fukuyama lasted about a decade. It was in this decade that the original book for Commanding Heights was written. The documentary came at the very beginning of a new age of the backlash to globalism that arose with 9/11.

The documentary is very much a product of its time. The source was written when the new economy was ascendant, the Clinton boom meant that the USA was paying back the debt and economists were worried about how to do monetary policy in an era of government surpluses.

The new millennium made a lot of those issues moot. It wasn't just 9/11, but the recession that came with the popping of the tech bubble exposing bad accounting from not just Enron but WorldCom and Tyco and Adelphia. All these names made the cover of the news magazines but receded to the collective unconscious. The last third tries to deal with this, but is too close in time to be truly reflective.

What commanding heights is at its core is a celebration of the economy that was in force in 1998. It is a celebration of free markets and the rise of the Austrian school. It is a celebration of Margaret Thatcher waving around a copy of Hayek and claiming, This is what we believe. It is a celebration of Reagan, or at least a version of Reagan that ignores pulling back from the tax cuts to a more modest tax reform, a Reagan that ended the cold war standing at the Brandenburg gate telling Gorbachev to Take down this wall  and not the Reagan that illegally sold arms to Iran to fund right-wing death squads against an elected government in Central America. And I get it. This time was good for a lot of people up until it wasnt. It was so good that once it crashed the first time, we doubled down in America by pushing through tax cuts and borrowing more and inflating the deficit so that people could buy houses and we remade the good times.

And then this time it wasn't good. Were still coming to terms with the fact that perhaps the return to technology isn't as high as we want it; that demographic pressures are working against the economy especially if we have less immigration. The tea party and Occupy and Bernie and Trump are two sides of the same coin  the coin being the realization that things are not as we have been told. It is a backlash of the world that is described in Commanding Heights, one that even a decade along after the crash we haven't come to terms with. If Thatcherism was the English coming to terms with the fact that they were no longer an empire, perhaps that is just the reckoning that Trumpism is, with the red baseball hats and the weird idea that we need to look to the past to remake America in an image of the ideal and not look forward.

One thing that really strikes me is that the Commanding heights sets up this great clash between Keynes and Hayek. As if Keynesianism didn't work so this Hayekian version is what we should go with. And looking back now we see that both models of how to let capitalism have their limits. Perhaps the problem lies not with the interpretation of the system, but the system itself.

Two side notes: first one of the things that bugs me is setting up a dichotomy between Keynes and Hayek. Theyre not on the same level. Theres a reason that any time a fan of Hayek starts talking about his biography they must rope in the time he was in London and Keynes was at Cambridge. Theres no parallel to people talking about Keynes. Hayek is but a footnote. On the flip side, Hayek does have that Nobel prize at least.",1511654400,,3546,4.403053435114503
