8168715,2,B000MG2LOA,"What a bad low budget film. It was just barely watchable. The plot is stupid, and the acting was just bad across the board.",1513728000,,123,4.166666666666667
8168716,2,B000MG2LOA,"I'm really not even sure how to describe it. My thoughts roamed off whenever the music was playing to a b-movie you just keep watching, as though there was nothing else on TV. There is a story line, but I wasn't able to follow it closely. I don't think I could force myself to watch it again to catch on.",1510531200,,304,4.083333333333333

8168718,2,B000MG2LOA,"fast and good price they had,but now i have seen a lot of 3ds and many of them german import,and that is absolutly not the same as ""hollywood"" made 3d the new way....",1337558400,,166,4.0606060606060606
8168719,1,B000MG2LOA,"..would be trash!
Though the lead actors in this flick are enough to make you want to watch it...the movie itself makes you want to poke your eyes out.  The horrible cinematography, the disastrous lighting...and the non existent blocking in allot of the scenes makes this hot mess just a pain to sit through.  I don't know if the producers of this flick spent all of the money on Micheal Madson or what happened but he is easily the best thing about the turd...and he is not enough to save it.",1228780800,3,493,4.406593406593407
8168720,4,B000MG2LOA,"Great star turns by Madsen (Kill Bill) and McDonough (Oz) make this a fun but dark romp. If you like mob movies or bad cop movies, this is one to watch. The plot lines cross each other almost as much as the characters do giving it a Crash feel. The big difference is no coincidences here.",1204156800,2,288,4.160714285714286
