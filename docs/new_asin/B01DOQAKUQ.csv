7719900,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Crimson Peak is one of Guillermo del Toros (Pans Labyrinth) films and is done as a classic gothic romance/horror movie complete with a dilapidated mansion that breathes when its windy outside, blood-red earth that oozes up from the decaying floors like blood, a secretive brother and sister pair, Thomas and Lucille Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain), an American damsel named Edith (Mia Wasikowska), a heroic doctor (who we couldve done completely without since he doesnt end up actually saving the damsel in the end), and ghosts aplenty.

There are no huge surprises in the film and the story unfolds predictably, but its all so lavish, so textured, and so beautifully filmed that you cant help but watch it all.  I'd liked to see it a few more times, in part just to take in more of the detail of the mansion.  Spiky archways look like gaping maws; deaths heads and a moth motif can be seen in the wall paper, in the tiles in the floor and in the woodwork; in the main entryway, the ceiling has caved in so it rains leaves into the foyer.  And theres one scene in the mining chamber where gaps in the ceiling let shafts of light down into darkness, and snow falls down the shafts onto the blood-red earth below.  It was gorgeous.  Theres even the neat trick of bloody footprints in the snow that are actually created when the actors stepped across the snow-covered red earth and the earth stained the snow red.  Its all very ingenious, and quite stunning.  And even though you know horrible things happen in the house, you cant help but want to look around it more.

The ghosts were done marvelously well.  If this movie had been shown say 40 years ago, it wouldve scared the bejeezuz out of people... but weve seen a lot cinematic tricks, so nothing is really surprising anymore so much as its intriguing. Some of the ghosts were red (like the ground, like blood) others were black, and others were off-white (depending on their souls, I think).  They seem to seethe reddish-black smoke from every orifice and fingertip, or appear in the air like dust, or take on more solid grotesque forms that echo the way they died.

I really like Hiddleston, and I like the way del Torro photographed him throughout the film  accentuating his bright green eyes; the only consistently ""bright"" thing in the whole movie.  Theres one scene where hes just watching Edith, not saying a word, and the camera just focuses on his face.  You see about five different emotions wash over it within a matter of seconds.  Its incredible.  ((Tom Hanks can do that, too.  Must be a Tom-skill.))  Theres also some nekkidity, but not too much, although we do get to see Hiddlestons butt (which is actually kind of... well... pretty).

If I have any complaint its that the movie seemed to go by way too fast.  I wanted at least another 30 minutes so I could learn more about the Sharpes and their relationship with one another.  Only the very surface of those two is touched on, and you KNOW theres a much better, scarier, creepier story underneath their prim skin than what del Torro gives you in the story he presented.  The whole thing would make an awesome mini-series, I think.  (Look out American Horror Story.)",1445040000,4,3201,4.644760213143872
7719901,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Edith (Mia Wasikowska) is an aspiring novelist in early-20th-century America, the sheltered only child of a wealthy industrialist and widower (Jim Beaver).  She falls under the spell of Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), a charming, but nearly destitute baronet visiting this side of the Atlantic to secure financing for a prospective mining operation on his land in North West England.  After a tragedy and much to surprise of polite society, Edith and Thomas wed, and she journeys to live with him in his ancestral home.  It is an opulent, but decayed manor slowly descending into the expanse of scarlet clay upon which it is constructed, and the newlyweds share it with his icily guarded sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), and, it turns out, a host of perturbed spirits.  To survive what she discovers to be a hostile environment, a frightened, yet determined Edith must unravel the mysterious history of the Sharpe family.

Crimson Peak is a hypnotic geyser of a film:  a cavernous, richly imagined Edwardian spectacle of high fashion, the grotesque, and the sensual.  Highly respected genre specialist Guillermo del Toro directs it with the contagious and unbridled enthusiasm of a child unleashed in a toy store.  His influences are not hard to spothe draws from the headstrong heroines and windswept country estates of Henry James and the Bront sisters, as well as the suspense films Gaslight and Notorious, both of which feature Ingrid Bergman as an imperiled wife in a duplicitous householdbut his reverence is productive, powering a vigorous homage to an antique and profoundly romantic idea of the macabre.

As evidenced previously by, among others, Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy II: The Golden Army, del Toro is nearly as fastidious a student of the otherworldly as Wes Anderson is of mordant whimsy, and his perfectly ghastly vision informs even the briefest scenes here (an early moment of character development, for example, involves spirit photography).  Every detailevery candlelit hallway, every craning camera movement, every skeletal and viscid phantomis thoughtful and just so, the result of a cinematic wizardry born of a nerdy and undying devotion to haunted-house theatricality.

And in a pleasant surprise, the content and the cast are not outshone by the lush form.  The contorting plot of inheritance and insanity is perfectly structured, each deviant development and spectral jolt timed with an almost mathematical precision, and it functions both as a fanciful ghost yarn and a debauched, mournful love story.  The one aim never overshadows the other.  And the gifted central performersthe wide-eyed and ethereal Wasikowska, the dastardly and debonair Hiddleston, the severe Chastainare invited to create characters writ large, dialing every attribute and response slightly higher than they otherwise might so as to fall in line with the operatic scope and fevered timbre of the production.  However, they never go so far as to lapse into camp and dilute the resonance of the characters and the webs they spin around one another.",1445040000,166,3058,5.276288659793814
7719902,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"This is possibly one of the best films of all time!
Some people might hate this because they might be expecting that this movie is a scary movie, but unfortunately it's not. There was this line where the character of Mia Wasikowska (Edith) said: the story of the book that she's writing is not a ghost story, it's a story with a ghost in it, and the ghost is only a metaphor. And it looks like that's what happened in the movie. The movie is more like a romance film, which is what Guillermo Del Toro said, it's a Gothic Romance.

The ending of the film is the best part of the film, the most thrilling and intense part. A very bloody good ending.

The acting is superb, especially Jessica Chastain and she really deserves an award for her performance. The musical scoring is great and the visual effects are stunning. I have to confess, the movie didn't really met my expectations. But even though, the movie still managed to amaze me. One of those movie where you have to expect the unexpected.",1444953600,,996,4.437158469945355
7719903,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. You see, I had been waiting impatiently for Crimson Peak for about a year. From the day I first heard it was in production, I knew I was going to be at the theater on opening night to see it. Jessica Chastain and Charlie Hunnam are two of my favorite actors, and it is not very often a gothic horror/romance film hits the big screen, after all. With Guillermo del Toro masterminding the project, it had the potential to be great.

Imagine my disappointment, then, when Crimson Peak turned out to be just okay.

For all its mesmerizing visuals and brooding overtones, Crimson Peak is neither that interesting nor that scary. The mystery surrounding Baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) and his devious sister Lucille (Chastain) is never fully realized. Their motives are questionable from their first appearance onscreen, prohibiting the audience from playing that oh-so-fun Whos Good and Whos Bad? game that can make films painstakingly suspenseful. Their end-goal is never really in doubt, either; as events play out, the audience knows the film can only be headed one way.

For me, the twists and turns were far too easy to follow, and I had most of the major reveals figured out long before they were explicitly shown to the audience. Similarly, the ending is as Hollywood as it gets. I found this to be crucially detrimental to the film as a whole, especially considering a much darker, more fitting outcome was easily doable without altering the first hour and forty-five minutes of the film.

Despite these complaints, I still found a lot of enjoyment in Crimson Peak. The photography is absolutely stunning; in all honesty, it is one of the most visually formidable films I have ever watched. If nothing else, it is beautifully artistic and is almost worth seeing for that reason alone. In addition, all of the main actors turn in convincing performances: Mia Wasikowska as the nave love interest who sees ghosts, Hiddleston as her deceitful lover, Chastain as his domineering sister, and Hunnam as the good-guy physician.

I must also note that Crimson Peak gives us two of the most fantastically brutal murders I have ever witnessed onscreen, and despite use of del Toros fakey, CGI-laden ghosts (if youve seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mama/dp/B00AIBZM40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mama</a>, you know the type), it still manages to throw a few good scares into the mix.

Sadly, Crimson Peak is not the type of film to do well at the box office, and I will not be surprised if it bombs, leaving us genre-film fans waiting at least a decade for Hollywood to fund another Gothic horror epic. Its target audience is too small: teens will hate it for being too slow and not overtly scary enough; most adults will find it too predictable and only moderately effective.

In spite of my own discontent with portions of Crimson Peak, I did still enjoy it and will probably see it again when it hits DVD. It would also not be unfair to say that I set myself up for disappointment; I was way too excited about this movie. Nevertheless, it just does not quite hit the mark. I will still tell my friends to go see it, but make sure to temper your expectations.",1444953600,8,3259,4.893115942028985
7719904,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"The ghosts in the movie, like in her manuscript represent time. And other then some jump scares, this is mostly about humans being broken by those they love.

7719908,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"So much style over substance, what a disappointment.  I had high hopes for a truly gothic ghost story, but this wasn't it.  First of all, the CGI ghosts....awful, this is not what the ghostly spectres of Victorian ghosts should look like. And without giving too much away, for instance, if the mother ghost is trying to warn her daughter, why come back looking like a demon from hell? The house was over the top with a gigantic hole in the roof, ridiculous, the clay was the color of blood, the story was tired, done in other movies much more effectively, and the acting....meh. If you want an atmospheric ghost story, watch The Others, even the Original Haunting or The Legend of Hill House, the original.  Crimson Peak has been compared to The Shining.....not even close.",1531094400,,773,4.711111111111111

7719913,2,B01DOQAKUQ,Terrible movie. Overacting and bad dialogue in this chewing-the-scenery kind of movie. Jessica Chastain is horrible in this! Really not looking forward to IT2 and her Beverly role. Guess there are two red heads of the age in Hollywood and she was picked over Amy Adams. You can figure out the generic plot near the beginning of the movie. Waste of money.,1530403200,,354,4.725806451612903
7719914,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"The acting is great. The set is awesome. The ghosts are freaking creepy as is that house. But something was missing. There was shock and horror, but there was little connection between the characters. I think the directing was too fast, the actors weren't allowed to find the heart of their characters. And I get that the music was supposed to be some kind of throw back to Gothic drama, but it really overpowered everything else with it's over-the-top cheesiness. Also, I was thrown when the male lead gave Mr. Rochester's speech from Jane Eyre. Was it supposed to be clever, to say that speech to the actress who played Jane Eyre? It completely distracted me from what was happening in the scene. Although, it occurs to me now that might have been deliberate, to highlight how phony he was.. OK, that is kind of clever.

Overall, I think the female lead was poorly written. The actress gave it her best, and she is very good, but she had too little to work with. She seldom reacted to things like a real person would. Coughing up blood? Huh. Weird wells full of blood-colored goop in the basement, with metal covers locked over them? The English and their peculiar ways. And though the house is fun, it goes beyond realistic. Especially her reaction to it. Which was basically no reaction. A missing roof? Blood colored stains on all the walls, rotting and dilapidated objects all over the place? For a woman of her up-bringing? Whatever. It's fine. Look, a dog!

I believe this movie is a victim of the current poor writing trend. Apparently Hollywood is spending all of it's money on actors and special effects, and there is no money left over to hire a decent script writer. At least it's not a remake.",1530230400,,1707,4.6118421052631575

The plot was predictable and the writing was bad.
You get some good acting from Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain towards the end but thats all. Mia Wasikowska could have been better.

7719930,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"RELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""Crimson Peak is a Gothic drama/mystery/horror about a young woman (Mia Wasikowska) in the opening years of the 1900s who falls in love with a mysterious English man (Tom Hiddleston) and moves from Buffalo, NY, to a creepy English manor, where his weird older sister also lives (Jessica Chastain). Ghosts of the past make themselves known, ultimately leading to the truth.

Aside from Jane Eyre and House of Usher, both of which have been filmed several times, Crimson Peak has similarities to haunting Gothic flicks like Bram Stokers Dracula (1992), The Others (2001) and Mary Shelleys Frankenstein (1994), but its thankfully nowhere near as ridiculously melodramatic as the latter. The spectral horror is more low-key than Dracula and Frankenstein, which is why I cite The Others. Psychological Gothic horror like Demons of the Mind (1972) and The Eternal (1998) are other comparisons. If you're in the mood for a movie like these, youll probably appreciate Crimson Peak.

Honestly, this is one of the most sumptuously LOOKING movies Ive ever seen. Take, for instance, the numerous scenes of Edith (Mia) walking down the lavish halls in an alluring white nightgown and flowing blond hair. The Gothic lushness is to die for.

Some people think the story is meh, but its no better or worse than the plots of the seven movies listed above. Whilst the first act in Buffalo is somewhat tedious, the movie picks up interest once Edith (Mia) moves to the unsettling English chateau, which has seen better days. I read a critics list of a dozen questions in an attempt to tear the film to pieces, but I easily answered all of them, which showed that this critic was intentionally LOOKING FOR something to dislike. Every potential quibble is effortlessly explained by clues in the picture or simply reading in-between the lines.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 59 minutes and was shot in Hamilton, Kingston and Toronto, Canada. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Matthew Robbins.

I couldn't not fall in love with Tom, despite the weirdness of the situation, Im a hopeless romantic, and he sure plays that role well. The story line becomes pretty predictable very fast and there is definitely a depth lacking and there were definitely underdeveloped points that bothered me a bit. The creepiness/thrill factor is about all I could handle, my limit being pretty low for this ghost thriller genre.

7719968,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Crimson Peak is a beautiful, melancholy, grotesque dream/nightmare; it's a true hybrid (definitely classic gothic romance, but with a potent dose of horror and fairy tale) - the Brontes, Bava and Hitchcock, and much much more, all filtered through a wonderfully crazy Mexican genius. I do feel del Toro has created a new breed of beast out of the old, comprised of many different parts, a kind of Frankenstein monster, but gorgeous and feminine, tragic and beautiful, unique and multi-layered. The acting by Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddelston and Jessica Chastain is absolutely first rate - it's melodrama, as in classic Hollywood, but not maudlin or cartoonish, the actors still manage to be naturalistic and not come off artificial; they're both dramatic and subtle (beautiful work) - I found Wasikowska particularly moving in the scene that takes place with Edith in the morgue. The characters, representing the polarities of love/fear, past/future, transformation and decay, and the tension between, are archetypes, but, at the same time, they're complex individuals and profoundly human  they must choose their own destiny.

What I feel is often missing these days, with all the formula, box-checking approach to movies, is real individuality - Crimson Peak is the full expression of a creative artist, it's not following trends or determined by committees; it's one person bringing multiple talents together to express a vision. This film is visually fantastic, romantic and hallucinatory, tragic and outrageous - it creates its own ""logic"" within a waking-dream reality  pure cinematic magic!",1515628800,3,1595,5.397590361445783

7719970,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"A lot of the complaints about this movie I've seen come from the misconception that this is a horror movie. Horror and everything Gothic are absolutely related, but they are not the same. The point of this movie isn't to scare, it's to unsettle and provoke thought. We see characters butting up against the supernatural, against other people, against desires, and misconceptions, and fears, and then working through those things. The house itself is another character provoking the main three and shaping the narrative. And as a Gothic, this movie is practically a love letter. The music, the colors, everything about the composition and the writing sink the viewer into the world. It is absolutely, definitely not chewing gum for the brain, but you can still watch it just to have a fun, creepy time.

**Spoilers beyond this point**

We know from the start that there's something very wrong about the Sharpes, but we still want to know what, AND we still care about Thomas Sharpe, despite the implications. The twisted relationship between the siblings, and I do actually mean the psychological one, not the physical, it remarkably well written. It's intense and raw and thoroughly disturbing. For people complaining about the incest-- it was right there in the trailer, and you missed it. It's also a common theme in this genre, one used to strengthen and further the plot of the movie. Maybe people with less familiarity with Gothics might enjoy this less. I think it'd be a fun way to get to know the genre.",1515542400,6,1511,4.875486381322958

But it drives me nuts that most horror films today seem so obsessed with over-the-top violence, gross-out or jump scares, that the constant parade of dreck makes it hard for me to find any modern horror films to enjoy. Leave it to the great Del Toro to make not only one of the best horror films, but one of the best films period I've seen in recent years. This movie is well-directed, well-written, and perfectly acted, the cast isn't especially large, but the performances are all excellent. Also, I don't normally focus on or gush about the visual, but; this movie is THE DEFINITION of GORGEOUS, the lighting, colour palette, set decoration, camerawork, this movie could be called an art film solely on it's visuals. This movie starts out slow, and it's very different from most other horror films that come out these days, but that's what I love.

Edith glowed almost all the time she was on screen. And it had a decent over all plot. It just could have been so much better. The plot unfortunately does not sustain he length of this movie and there are long times when you feel like, just get on with it.  The basic plot is this.. rich young heiress becomes the object of a pair of schemers who hope to lure her to support their desires and then kill her. Gosh I think even in the 19th century this was cliche plot.  The problem is this heiress can see ghosts who warn her as best they can to the impending doom. Unfortunately not well enough and not on a timely basis.  Now trapped in an isolated manor in England where she has no friends and no one around for miles.. she has to survive on her own. The movie should have been about 30 minutes shorter and Jessica Chastain's character should not have been so obvious. When she found out her brother slept with his wife she had a complete melt down.

A strong, independent woman and yet she falls in love with the first out-of-towner she meets and within days is so completely lovestruck that she disregards her fathers wishes (he already shared his thoughts of this stranger prior to his...well, you watch), is heartbroken at the idea of him leaving and throws herself into his arms and, despite scorning the idea of marriage, literally fawns and becomes his weak little plaything.

The movie is gorgeous to look at. But the characters behavior, from the brother/sister duo to the lead character, sully the watch for me.",1500336000,3,804,5.217054263565892

This movie was literally unbelievable to me. If you are thinking while watching this film, you'll be disappointed. The sets are lovely, I'll give it that.

I guess there are spoilers below. But seriously this movie is so predictable it's hard to call them spoilers. These are just a few of my gripes.

WHY, after stating strongly her disinterestedness in ever marrying does she marry Thomas? What even made her fall in love with him? If she were to fall in love with anyone, marry anyone, the eye doctor would be the obvious choice. Her character is supposed to be smart and independent. She didn't need to marry anyone, wasn't desperate, wasn't poor.

WHY didn't the hired investigator, after the dad dies, divulge to the public, the church, - anyone! - etc. that Thomas was already married once it became clear a wedding was set?

WHY wasn't the obvious murder of her father investigated??!!!?!? It was treated by everyone like he died of normal causes.

WHY, upon coughing up blood the first time, did she not tell Thomas?

HOW does a woman thrown from 2-3 stories, and thus breaking one leg requiring to be set under heavy sedation, who was already at the brink of death after being poisoned, get up soon afterwards and start running around the house?

She finds the recordings, great. But does she find a secluded, quiet place to listen to them quietly? No, she sits out in the open with it cranked full blast, then leaves all the evidence out for Thomas and his crazy sister to find. Why in the world did the sister even keep the trunk with all the very convenient clues for the next Mrs. to find?

Why the hell eat the porridge offered to you from the same person who you know is poisoning your tea?

How are we supposed to be sympathetic to Thomas after what he has done, when he simply could've restrained his sister instead of stabbing the doctor. What an idiot. He's not supposed to be an idiot.

The blind insanity of the sister was boring, boring, boring.

Of course as soon as the dog sets foot on the screen, I know what this predictable movie is going to do with him.

The ghosts added nothing to the story. Couldn't even muster up the emotional involvement to be scared by them. How about having a ghost who wants something actually convey what they want, like in THE CHANGELING. I don't appreciate the flaky, worn out scare tactics. Boring!

I can't watch poor Mia in her nightgown without thinking of Dee Snider circa 1984.

All these characters were so utterly stupid, which they were not supposed to be. The film didn't make me care about any of them, with the exception of the dog. Ugh what a mess.

And one last small complaint: Victorian Virgins don't ride.",1500336000,3,2921,4.567049808429119

The story beats are perfect. They'll more than meet the expectations of fans of fiction by Victoria Holt, Phyllis Whitney, Dorothy Eden, and Mary Stewart.

But, this story isn't locked into the ""helpless woman"" model of the past. Despite a very credible 19th-century setting, the women in this eerie story show strength and power, as well as normal (not gender-specific) moments of weakness. Until the very end, viewers won't be certain how the story ends, and who will survive the harsh extremes of Crimson Peak.

You don't even raise an eyebrow about the coincidence -- for lo, you are a young woman getting swept off your feet in a romance by said titled Englishman!  O great joy!  (Seriously, I thought del Toro had more respect for females than to depict any female character as so STUPID)  So you go off, and the Gothic ensues.
Wow. This could have been an incredible ecological Gothic horror film.  Instead del Toro dumbly recycles his ""Mama"" monsters.  The whole whole looks like the set of a video game.  What a disappointment.  What a missed opportunity.
And when he cuts back to ""Buffalo,"" he makes it look like Forest Lawn Cemetery overlooks Niagara Gorge.  That COULD have been a great visual, it he'd taken time with it.  but, well, kinda no.....just like everything else about this film......",1489190400,8,1359,4.8478260869565215

Any viewer can predict from the moment Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain enter the film that they're the villains and they have some sort of nefarious plan for Mia Wasikowska. You can see that coming from a mile away. Why it takes Mia so long to figure that out is difficult to understand. The film is advertised as a ghost story, as in humans vs. ghosts, but that's not what it is. It's a thriller that happens to have a few inconsequential ghosts in it. It's Mia vs. Jessica and Tom the whole time. It also takes Mia an incredibly long time to figure out that Tom and Jessica's middle-of-nowhere mansion is nicknamed ""Crimson Peak."" It's hard to believe that she didn't know that before she moved all the way across the ocean to live there. If you like predictable thrillers, this one's for you.

The acting was great, the set was amazing, and the story was interesting. I think the problem a lot of people had with the movie was the trailer made it look like a horror movie and it's not. It's a gothic romance. Some parts were very intense and the ghosts were very creepy but it didn't scare me. The only reasons I gave this movie 4 stars is because it had too much blood (Not a fan of bloody movies) and I thought the ending should have been different.

7720051,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"I'm a big Guillermo Del Toro fan, and when I heard that he was making a haunted house film I was jumping up and down with joy. Then, before the film came out GDT stated repeatedly that Crimson Peak is more of a gothic love story, and while that is true it just makes me want this to be a traditional haunted house story. I wasn't that invested in the love story at all. I thought the production designs were really good and the characters looked the part, but I didn't feel like the actors could really grasp and pull me into their world. Tom Hiddleston is definitely the standout in this film as well as the ghosts that appear. In classic GDT fashion the ghosts are creepy and haunting, which just made me want the whole film to be like that. You'll be scared and/or creeped out in the beginning when they introduce the ghosts, but they don't appear back again until late in the movie. So, if you like GDT, and are willing to see a film that's a little out of his wheel house then I'd say give this a shot.",1486252800,,1007,4.195876288659794

Cons: it was pretty predictable and I guessed what would happen not even halfway through. I thought the ghosts looked cheesy, and the violent scenes were pretty gory, which I guess wouldn't bother some, but just FYI if that's not your thing.

7720055,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"This movie could have been better if the story and characters were more consistent.  (Spoilers)
The trailer for the movie is completely misleading.  This movie is more of a murder thriller mystery, and the ghosts are actually entirely ancillary and unnecessary.  The CGI ghosts are too scary looking, given that they don't do anything to hurt anyone I don't know why the writers tried to make it seem like the ghosts were the bad guys by making them so scary.  The trailer also right away made me think that Thomas and Jessica Chastain's character were married, so the ""surprise"" that they were together was ruined by the trailer.  The trailer also made me think that they brought Edith to the house because they knew she could talk to ghosts.  In the actual movie they were completely unaware there were ghosts.

The movie would have been better if the main character Thomas had been the one that killed his family as a child and then later married someone who talked him into marrying women for their money and then murdering them.  As it is, the movie goes out of its way to make Thomas seem like a redeemable good guy...but he already seduced and murdered 3 innocent women for money, it's pretty clear he's a bad guy.  Also making his accomplice his sister/lover seemed unnecessary, it doesn't add anything that she is his sister.  It's already twisted enough.  The incest takes it way over the top to the point of stupidity.
Edith's character can talk to ghosts, and her mother's ghost tells her twice to beware Crimson Peak, which is a little know nickname of the house that Thomas lives in.  Edith's mother's ghost is useless and Edith ignores the advice anyways.  It just makes me wonder why there are ghosts at all in this movie, it could easily stand as a murder mystery thriller without adding another layer of complexity with the ghosts and trying to wonder what they're doing there and what their motives are.  They actually end up feeling tacked on and unnecessary.  Maybe the studio decided that it needed ghosts to do well with audiences.",1485820800,4,2054,4.698324022346369

7720100,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"I find this film to be very misunderstood. I have heard quite a few people criticize this movie for not being scary and also because it's predictable.  But I think they are missing the point.  for one, I don't think it was meant to be scary, for it wasn't really a ghost story, but a story with ghosts in it.  if u watch the film, you'll understand the reference.  the ghosts really are a metaphor for the concept of not letting go of the past and letting it rest.  by keeping it with you, it holds you down and haunts you.  and the more you hide things, rather than confront it, it will get uncovered.  u confront the past, then move on.  as for it being predictable, I don't think it was meant to be much of a thriller or mystery.  I think it wasn't about the mystery as it was about unfolding the story of the characters.  I don't think it was about horror which is the 'what' of the story, and the 'who did it?'.  but rather I think it's about 'why' the characters did what they did, and 'how' they did it. once u focus on the 'why' and 'how' part of the story, and focus on the unfolding of the story itself, you'll see that it is a great film, wonderfully done, the direction/cinematography is award-winning, the costumes are well done, the actors really sell that world, and you do feel for it by the end.  it also lingers with you.  it's a movie that I walked away thinking about.  it kind of rests in the back of your psyche.

The scare factor of the film lies in the very existence of ghosts and the pain of their deaths; the ghosts themselves are more frightful in appearance than dangerous. Hardcore horror addicts might be left wanting. Otherwise, this film has a lot of depth beyond the visuals; a second viewing shines light on the character's intentions and motivations.

The only downside is that the movie tries too hard to be scary, when it's not even necessary for the storyline, characters, etc. So it turns into a mishmash of great storytelling and random jumpscares that try their hardest to make the film fit into the horror genre.

I always smh at critics' 'Monday morning quarterback' takes on creative endeavors that they themselves wouldn't know how to even approach, let alone perfect. This film is a beautiful, visceral experience - every shot is masterfully executed by all those it takes to accomplish a single moment in a movie like this, (or even a bad movie for that matter). For the genre, which I assume is something like 'Classic, Gothic, Tragic, Supernatural, Ghost/Love' story w/ some last minute redemption thrown in....come on, what exactly are the parameters of excellence for this type of film? I think that Del Toro has well earned 5 little stars...",1477094400,3,789,5.030534351145038
7720136,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"Just as always, Amazon got this DVD to me real quick.

But the film itself was a disappointment.  From director Guillermo del Toro, I expected something of the same caliber as the original version of THE HAUNTING, starring Julie Harris and Claire Bloom.  But there's too much color in this haunted house movie, and not enough shadows and darkness.  The story was lacking for me as well, and there was not enough tension.

All that said, I believe that del Toro would be the perfect director for a feature-length film adaptation of any of the short stories of Jorge Luis Borges.  MIMIC demonstrated that del Toro could creep us out with bizarre, frightening creatures.  PAN'S LABYRINTH showed that he could tell stories set in fantasy worlds, even if they're in someone's mind.  And PACIFIC RIM based itself on the idea of two universes--ours, and one from which terrifying monsters came--just as Borges' stories often did.

All in all, del Toro has done better and can do better than CRIMSON PEAK.",1477008000,,997,4.817647058823529

The script and acting are fairly awful, even comically harebrained at times; the clues to the 'mystery' at hand are telegraphed so loudly and repeatedly that only a babe in the woods wouldn't guess what's going on; and the special effects are so overdone yet used to such small impact that their sporadic presence seems to belong to another movie entirely.  As a ghost story, CP is nothing more than a cobbling together of cliches; as a film it is, in a word, immature.  1 1/2 stars for some nice cinematography and set designs.",1475884800,,1093,5.0220994475138125

If you liked THE WOMAN IN BLACK, you'll probably enjoy this CGI epic. If you want to see a truly shiver-inducing Gothic film, buy or rent Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS (the finest film involving the supernatural I've ever seen) or THE HAUNTING by Robert Wise. Both are in black and white and both feature a minimum of special effects. But both feature extraordinary actors.

In the early 1930's, the critic Paul Rotha argued that (even as Hollywood was mastering the art of color) there would always be some stories (especially stories featuring the surreal or the supernatural) that would always benefit from being filmed in black and white. After all, we live in a world of ""color."" To create a world truly alien to our own, the surest way is to film a world that is ""black and white.""",1475107200,4,1105,4.666666666666667

  Now it is 1901 in Buffalo, New York, fourteen years later. Edith Cushing is an adult of 24. She is a writer trying to sell her fictional story of ghosts. One night, her father, Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver) gets dressed up to go to a social party. Emily is in her bedroom to read a book. The door handle is moving and then the door opens by itself. No one is there. The handle moves again and just as Edith decides to shut the door, she sees the black-veiled ghost floating in the hallway.

Audio Commentary with Guillermo del Toro.

For years, Guillermo del Toro had been in line to develop a new Disney Haunted Mansion movie with the story including the Hat Box Ghost, but it never happened, so this is the horror movie he made.

7720170,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"The movie was all set design and costumes (beautiful, to be sure).  The ghost story is my favorite genre, defined by its individual or social psychology, and its moody and suspenseful tropes.  I expected del Toro to nail this, but Crimson Peak has no psychology, no persistent and luring mystery from which to build suspense, and ultimately, no cohesive story or meaning.

Also, once you've been presented with a meat-dripping skeleton swimming in the floor, or a blood-bathing corpse with a hatchet wedged in her head, once you're watching a serial killer chase someone around a mining excavator in the blood-red snow, you ain't in ghost territory; you're solidly in the thrill-based slasher genre, realizing you rented the wrong movie.",1473638400,4,737,5.125

I can say without spoiling it, that the ghost special effects are truly horrifying.  But the story of why they're earth-bound isn't spoiled by gradually spelling it out.

What isn't immediately apparent is their non-sinister motives, despite their appearance of being demonic.  There's a lot going on here in a relatively short span of time.  So, sit back, pretend you're sipping a glass of absinthe, or a tea of laudanum to calm your nerves, and try not to jump out of your skin when black-rotten living bones burst through the door to deliver their message.",1468108800,,875,4.871621621621622

7720260,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"Bookish young woman Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is mostly focused on publishing her first novel in 1901 Buffalo, New York. She is distracted from her ambition by Englishman Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). He's in town seeking financing from her father and his bank. Thomas's English estate has a special red clay that is very versatile. The only challenge is mining the clay. Thomas has a contraption that will mine efficiently but needs money to make a full-scale model. Edith's father has the goods on Thomas--Thomas has already been to London, Edinburgh, and Milan seeking financing. All with no success, so the dad does not want to finance him. Meanwhile, Thomas woes Edith. Is his motive true love or gold digging? A tragedy makes Edith travel to England as Thomas's wife, but her new home is haunted by more than doubts about Thomas's motives--there be ghosts as well.

A lot of Gothic horror tropes are in this movie. The spooky, isolated countryside estate is called Allerdale Hall. The clay seeps up from the ground, staining winter snow red, making it  the titular Crimson Peak. The house's creepy housekeeper is Thomas's sister Lucille (Jessica Chastaine) who is an excellent piano player and an icy woman. The house has a dark basement that you don't really want to visit. The house is stocked with poison, ghosts, secrets, dilapidation, and a library to die for. The steampunk element of the mining machine is an interesting addition and del Toro provides a lot of amazing visuals and atmosphere.

Then why is the movie disappointing to me? The heroine is on paper an interesting woman but she's a little too passive and subdued to be a favorite. Hiddleston's character and performance is charming and complex but his character peters out at the end. The story is a little predictable which isn't so bad but the movie had no breathtaking or heartbreaking moments. Outside of the awesome visuals and Hiddleston's performance, the film is not very remarkable.

Disappointingly average.",1467158400,,1999,5.0120481927710845

7720274,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"The best part of this movie was the story. It is an engaging mystery - even though I could guess where it was going, I enjoyed the ride. The atmosphere - or the mood of the piece - was also entertaining. The setting drew heavily from stories like ""The Fall of the House of Usher;"" although, thankfully, the female lead is much more active and resourceful than most in the gothic horror genre.

However, there were flaws. The soundtrack was so overwhelming as to become annoying at times. Where quietness would have been an asset to the tension, the soundtrack went for melodrama. Another issue was the over-reliance on CGI. The plot of this movie was captivating enough; why muck it up with a bunch of soon-to-be outdated graphics? I could almost imagine the boardroom meeting where some exe said, ""If there aren't any jump scares, the kids won't go see it."" The silliness of these moments took away, rather than added to, the overall creepiness of the picture.

However, as I said, the plot was good, the sets were macabrely beautiful, and the acting was solid. A 3.5 movie, with moments of a solid 4.",1466553600,,1102,4.61734693877551

Being by Guillermo del Toro I imagined it was going to be very intense, and visually beautiful, although there were some beautiful scenes, the snow falling through the roof into the house and the blood red snow to name a couple, for the most part I found the movie to be lackluster, somewhat slow, and tame. The ""bad guy"" was not dramatically evil, they even went so far as to suggest in the end that he wasn't so bad after all, and they never explained why the sister was so evil.

7720347,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"So, for a few years I'd read Jane Eyre every summer, because even if there were things I didn't like about the story (including the too-convenient ending), I liked the sensible heroine and the uneasy atmosphere. Once I got to college, I fell in love with Flannery O'Connor and Southern Gothic. Either way, I've always loved a well-written tragedy- the classic kind where you can see the characters speeding toward a doom that they built out of their own hopes and flaws.

For me, at least, Crimson Peak works on all those levels: eerie settings, people who keep deadly secrets and follow their flaws to the death (or at least fail to fix them in time to stop the tragedy), terrible things in beautiful, decaying settings. Anyone can see where most of the story is heading (although I didn't expect a lot of the things that happened during the last thirty minutes or so, which was a nice surprise), but it's all so solidly in character that the story works. If you're looking for a ghost story, keep walking- sure, there are ghosts, but all the horror comes from the things that the living characters have done. But if you've ever read and enjoyed anything Gothic, or you're just crazy about (very,very) flawed characters, there's a good chance you'll love this as much as I did.",1464048000,13,1278,4.654867256637168

7720350,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"I freely admit I am a fan of this director's work, so perhaps my review will be kinder than it might otherwise, but I enjoyed this dark mystery/thriller, and not just for the story.  The shots/special effects are sort of Tim-Burton-esque (which is a good thing in my opinion) and the plot benefits from having so few characters (the ghosts added to the roster more than make up for losses there).  Fun Victorian-era ghost story/mystery about a (rich) girl swept off her feet by a charming (but penniless) British aristocrat who takes her home to live in the country with his sister at their crumbling (literally) family manse.  Murder, mystery & mayhem ensue.  Don't want to give away too much, but Jessica Chastain is wonderfully creepy as the sister.  Mia W. is great, as always, but not a lot of meat in her character.  Tom H. is very good as the conniving (but with a heart!) husband.  I loved the atmosphere & special effects.",1463961600,,931,4.640243902439025

A young girl who was warned about Crimson Peak by the decaying ghost of her mother ends up at the location anyway and realizes that the home has a tortured past that wants to tell her it's story!

Like many romance book plots, the young lady, an only child who lives with her widowed father is wooed by a mysterious man who arrives to their city with his sister. He has background, a title and a large estate but is seeking investment capital. In fact, he and his sister are quite penniless, but they hide this from the townspeople as best as they can. He asks this young girls skeptical father to ""invest"" and is flatly refused. In no time her shrewd father meets his end, leaving his daughter orphaned and quite wealthy, without any knowledge of her fathers mistrust of her new beau. She falls into the mysterious beau's hands, marry, and off they go to his huge, elaborate, dismal dilapidated mansion on a red clay hill. The only protection the new bride has is she is not afraid of her own mothers ghost who tried to warn her of that house. (I thought her mothers ghost was  terrifying,but I habitually avoid spooky movies)...I will not ruin the story for you, but it is not a movie for children.....Adult themes, with moments of violent blood and gore also.",1462233600,3,1118,4.562189054726368

The movie is beautifully dark.  The scenery is beautiful.  The actors, frankly, beautifully perform their parts!  There is a lot well-done here.  But the story is just not impressive.

Crimson Peak is a ponderously slow ghost story/mystery which unravels at the speed of severe constipation.

If you enjoy ""ghost stories"", mystery/suspense movies, or atmospheric horror you should enjoy this. I wouldn't call it ""scary"" any more than I found Bram Stoker's Dracula to be scary (which is to say I didn't really find it to be scary at all). This movie is more spooky or creepy intertwined with some violence and elements of mystery. It has an eerie atmosphere similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula. It's slow building, visually beautiful and Gothic, and the environment completely envelops your senses. The acting was top notch and enjoyable as was the story line. It definitely was a beautifully shot film. There are death scenes etc so if you don't like graphic violence I would suggest not watching but for hardcore horror fans, you will find this movie very very tame and will need to rely on the visuals, acting, and mystery elements to carry the film father than expecting ""horror"" (there are some ""horror"" type scenes but compared to most horror films it is rather mild) I will probably buy this at some point and I can see myself watching it again and again.",1460678400,5,1230,4.699074074074074

7720434,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"This, Guillermo del Toros personal favorite of his films, was 9 years in the works and took three years of his life to create.  It is a gothic romance concerning an aspiring American novelist named Edith and her marriage to an impoverished English nobleman named Sir Thomas Sharpe.  Sharpe also has a sister with whom he has a characteristically sinister relationship.  Sharpe had approached Ediths father for financial support for one of his schemes and when it was denied the father was murdered.  Now Edith finds herself in an uber spooky English estate with her new husband and his sister.  She is, in many ways, alone while the brother and sister await the transference of her fathers estate to them.

Bottom line: this is a pastiche of a multiplicity of gothic romances, including Rebecca, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, et al.  The cues are all there and at points the audience is ready to yell at the screen, Dont drink that tea! or Dont go into the basement!

The star of the film, however, is the set of the mouldering estateall three levels of it (and none of it computer generated).  Its colder inside than outside, Edith proclaims, as leaves and/or snow fall into the homes center from the open, rotting roof.  The house is built on red clay, which seeps through the floorboards, like blood.  The entire conception of the set is brilliant and visually riveting.  It is the most memorable aspect of the film and memorable to a classic degree.

The director is at pains to point out that this is not a ghost story; ghosts, Edith tells us, are simply metaphors for the past (and we encounter some in the film).  Neither is it a horror story.  Nor is it a haunted house film; it is a film with a dark house that contains haunted people.  Obviously, the director has a great sense of genre and a professional sense of English and American literary and cinematic history.  This is, in some ways, a film buffs film, but the plot is completely predictable, the acting and script competent, the set designs spectacular.

Rated R for some extreme violence.  Not for children (unless they are as gothic as the script).",1460592000,,2119,4.678378378378379

7720450,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"First off, I have to say this is a stunningly gorgeous movie, at least in parts.  Other times, it is visually stunning, but probably gorgeous would not be the best word to apply.  The costumes are spectacular, the Crimson Peak estate is beyond fantastic, and the photography is magnificent.  The earlier scenes, in particular, are bathed in a rich, golden glow.  It is reminiscent of an old sepia print, but with brilliant tints.  But then, the movie becomes darker, much darker.

If youve read and loved any old gothic novels, you will recognize the plot of this movie.  Its the one about the wealthy young woman (Mia Wasikowska) , left alone in the world (here through disturbing circumstances), and obviously falling for the wrong man, an English baronet with title and with mansion but without cash.  We know from the start that he is too smooth, too slick and not what he seems, but to her, at least, hes more interesting that her wannabe boyfriend.  Who can explain love?

She has a secret, as well  she can see ghosts.  One of them, her very spooky dead mother, makes a startling appearance to warn her to beware of Crimson Peak.

By the way, I know thats what she said because I replayed the scene over and over until I could make it out.  And I only recognized the words Crimson Peak because, well, that is the title of the movie.  Really, if you are going to have a sinister warning, shouldnt it be intelligible?

So off she goes to the isolated estate, where no one can hear her scream.  Frankly, I would have thought a bit longer before I rushed off to marry the guy because of his very possessive and domineering sister (Jessica Chastain); the brother may really love the woman, or he may just be a superficially charismatic schemer, but the sister just comes across as a schemer, and neither a charismatic nor a pleasant schemer.  She has in-law trouble written all over her, and, worse, the three are going to be living together.  Alone.  Just the three of them.  Day after day.  That seems like trouble enough.

And then the estate.  You know those creepy old mansions in old movies?  Those are kiddy playhouses compared to this place.  The scope and detail are a visual feast.  But then she finds out that the place is nicknamed Crimson Peak.  Woman, your mother came back from the dead to warn you.  Run, run, you fool.  Oh, but then we would have had a very short movie.

There are a lot of spooky and often gruesome moments (she still sees dead people, and they are not pretty  so don't watch this while eating dinner, like I did).

At this point, the pace slows.  S-l-o-o-w-s.  But it picks up again and builds to an epic battle of good versus evil.  Well, maybe not epic since theres no cast of thousands, but quite stunning, nonetheless.

So, final verdict:  A darn good movie; unforgettable.  Not the greatest movie Ive ever seen, although one of the most visually amazing.  I had to go back and watch it again later.  The plot is pure gothic novel, all dark romanticism.  But all in all, it was very enjoyable and well worth a watch, or, in my case, two.  I especially enjoy the novelty of having not one, but two, strong women in one movie.  Yes, two!  Quick, name all the other movies made in the past 60 years with two strong female characters.

Im probably going back to watch it a third time.",1460073600,33,3322,4.498322147651007

Jessica Chastain is AMAZING as the evil sister. but her role is so sickening she should have refused it.  The heroine and her sinister new husband are as bland as two bars of old soap.  The heroine's rescuer--""Oh, isn't he dead yet?""  The only spot of light is a darling little Papillion puppy, who gets--you guessed it.  The incest aspect of the film is intended to be shocking and disturbing--but only comes across as disgusting.  It has been referred to as following the style of Edgar Allen Poe--WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7720460,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"I liked the work that Guillermo Del Toro did on Pan's Labyrinth.  That is why I was interested in seeing Crimson Peak when it was in theaters.  I thought that I should see a theatrical release that isn't a superhero movie, a blockbuster sequel, or a cartoon anyway.  Here is my take on it.

The story patiently builds itself up through each of the main events. If it weren't for the opening, this movie would initially feel like a plain Victorian romantic drama. Because of that, the moments of shocking bloodshed and creepy phantasmagoria have a real visceral impact. The sweeping cinematography really brings out the fancy scenery, especially once the main characters move into the extravagantly Gothic old house.

The bad news is that even with all the efforts to build up drama and character, the overall effect of the story feels a bit haphazard and half-baked. In some respects the horror elements feel clichd too (though I grant that I don't watch that many horror movies). I couldn't shake the feeling that Del Toro could have done better and could have produced a real masterpiece of dark fantasy. Crimson Peak could have been worse, to be sure, but I would still suggest Pans Labyrinth.",1459641600,,1196,4.786407766990291

The production design is the real star, with a distinctly beautiful but warped world built upon elaborate costumes, creatures and settings. And while the acting is also able, the unfortunate plot hinders what could have been a truly special experience.

7720475,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"It's a visually nicely done movie, the costumes, the sets, the ghosts (albeit they're not real original, Bicycle Girl from the Walking Dead makes an appearance at one point).  However what you think is going to be the overall plot and ending, is exactly what is delivered and the storyline itself isn't that exciting to get you through the 90 minutes there.

The basic plot revolves around an only heir to a fortune seemingly intelligent woman at the beginning of the film who wants to be a writer, of ghosts stories, but who faces the wall of sexist publishers who think women should only write fluff romance stories.  The American town's doctor who has returned from his studies, Charlie Hunnam (Jax from Sons of Anarchy) has always wanted to marry her and it seems this is what her father wants to.  But a snakeoil type salesman wanting investment money for his digger machine does all the right moves to make her fall for him.  Some other stuff happens that ends up with her accompanying him to his country where the digger machine is being built outside his falling apart mansion where his sister also lives.  Earlier in the film her mother as a creepy clawed ghost had breathed the words Crimson Peak and avoid or something vague like this, now other ghosts are appearing, letting her know this dream fairytale new beginning, may not turn out the way she had hoped.

Crimson Peak is watchable, but not something you're likely to ever bother with for a second viewing.  Edith the main character, (Mia Wasikowska) is sort of like two characters, the strong seemingly intelligent independent one in America, and the weak I need a man to save me am to stupid to work out what is going on one at Crimson Peak.",1459296000,,1710,4.639072847682119

The story is just so-so but the CGI effect ghouls are the worst. Really amateurish. Yet the way the House ""breathed"" when Lucille would become angry was really spooky. The last 10 minutes or so were BORING, (stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, yet they just keep on coming~eye roll~). Do I recommend it? As eye candy, yes.

From the trailers for this movie, i imagined a horror film. Which this is not, that would be a failure of the trailers though. However, its listed as a drama, mystery, horror film. While it does use the first 2 really well, i wouldn't consider this film for the horror genre.

7720526,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Sometimes the handsome stranger can be the Devil in disguise. This movie touches on that very subject. The main male character is easily recognized from Thor in which he plays Loki. He also plays on Avengers from Marvel as well as Loki. On this movie, a young woman is asked to a mansion by her dream man but just like most horror movies involving large mansions or castles, this mansion is very, very haunted. This is Gothic horror at it's finest! Classic haunted house movie with OUTSTANDING costumes, effects, wardrobe, sets, and pictures. This is much needed in modern horror because the gorefests that are usually standard issue in modern horror needs to be supplemented with the classic Gothic style, haunted house genre that gives TRUE scares, like in Mama or Insidious. The ""jumpscare"" or the ""sudden jolt"" will never go out of style just like the ""dark castle"", ""under the bed"", or ""ghost in the closet"" style horror because it is only human to fear the unknown/dark and if someone suddenly jumps at you, what happens? You either jump back or you fight back. That is called ""fight or flight"" which triggers survival instinct in just anyone or any animal. THAT is true fright which is what Gothic horror and this movie delivers. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. Enjoy!",1458777600,6,1295,4.811659192825112

It is curious gothic tale that is if anything about as visually striking as it comes. If you don't like a good gothic tale, or a ghost tale for that matter, the film is fantastic to watch just for the sets. So much detail was added throughout the entire film that it was hard to find a visual flaw. From the first moment on scene the story captures you and every actor comes across as believable in their roles. The casting director did a great job picking everyone that participated in this film. You get attached to them quickly and can even feel both an understanding and a remorse for even the antagonists by the time the film is completed.

7720546,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Beautiful, amazing, visually stunning Gothic ghost tale. I love how Del Toro has such a wonderful taste and ability to pick one of his favourite subjects, different each time, and develop it to such high quality standards. Whether it's Hellboy films (I love them and I'm not a comic book geek), Pan's Labyrinth (one of my favourite movies of all times), Pacific Rim or this, he makes it beautiful, classy, cool, genre-appropriate and does it with such love that you can't help admire his attention to detail and creativity. He loves his monsters, his ghosts (here they are not only scary but also stylish, with his recognizable flair), his Victorian maidens and dark and troubled gentlemen, his otherworldly beings are always steeped in world mythology and mystery and always have meaning besides the visual appeal. Yes, ghost stories of this kind have been done many times before, but they are not any longer. They are the stories of Mary Shelly, Bram Stoker, Edgar Allen Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, Brontes, even Decameron. I miss reading them under the sheet with the flashlight when a kid, and I feel nostalgic and a bit sad that they don't write them anymore like this.  I believe he wanted a one of his own that he could perfect and hold dear, with all the tragedy, doomed love, dark family secrets, skin tingling mystery, symbolic visuals, beautiful costumes and eloquent speech (when literary characters didn't have to violate each others senses to carry the message across).  If you ever watched Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, troubled by the sense of foreboding and suspense that painted more vivid nightmares than any CGI is capable of, if you ever in your childhood have been afraid to turn off the light after reading Conan Doyle or Poe (I'll be honest I still sometimes am), this is just that kind of a story.

7720581,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"I'm an avid fan of anything del Toro and look forward to pretty much every project he's involved with. However, that doesn't always translate to liking his films. My anticipation for this one was extremely high yet I was not overwhelmed after watching. So is it a love story with a few ghosts, or a ghost story with romance and deceit tossed in.... It's not a fantasy film or even really a horror film. The decaying ghosts were a del Toro trademark and IMO a work of SPEFX art, yet the film itself was at times slow and unnerving.
Mia and Co did a fine job acting, and after a few hints, the plot twists started to reveal themselves early on.
There is a story in there somewhere but lots of questions were left unanswered.
Also noticing lately the trend of something always falling from the sky in these types of films - leaves or some sort of debris. That's okay for effect, and once in a while, but it does get annoying. In this film, leaves were always falling through the holes in the roof yet there were no trees anywhere near the mansion....details missing that are unlike a film by Mr del Toro.
The settings and depth of details and color is excellent and the sound editing is amazing!
As a fan of his work I was considering a blind buy but glad I saw the rental first.

However there was entirely to much Jessica Chastain crazy sister scenes, and it really starts to get annoying by the half way point of the movie. In my opinion Jessica Chastain kind of ruins it. I've never wanted to reach through a screen, and slap someone more than I did when her character was in the scene. Not sure if that means she did a good job in the roll or not, however I personally think she took the whole sister with a brother fetish a bit to far, and I spent more time embarrassed for the characters than enjoying the story.",1458000000,,637,4.361344537815126

While the actors do a decent job, the script / plot is hackneyed and just plain silly. This is basically a children's story but with adult themes, gore and violence.

Tom Hiddleston *sigh*...that fringe alone is enough to power watch this...but it is more than that...think a faster paced ""Woman in Black"" with better eye candy and more gore...this has that re-watchability that we look for, in a vein along with ""Sleepy Hallow"", where it is the perfect shade of gloom on a fall day...I already want to watch it again and I am quite certain I will >:)",1457740800,,1048,4.876404494382022

Most horror movies are straightforward horror movies, as are romances but Guillermo del Toro has managed to mesh the two genres seamlessly. Crimson Peak is truly a delight to watch.
I would like to draw special attention to actor Jim Beaver for his brilliantly acted role of Carter Cushing in this movie. All of the roles were impressively played, but I enjoyed watching Jim Beaver the most.

What beautiful cinematography and editing. We had to watch it twice to be able to really see the Del Toro touch after knowing the story. The set design (which they really built the house as a full design) is incredible. Del Toro as a director made these fantastic decisions that honestly show how far he has come since Cronos. If you are a fan of Del Toro and feel you did not enjoy this movie, please go back and watch it again noticing his camera placements, set design and character development.

7720669,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"Crimson Peak is not a bad movie. It is directed by Guillermo del Toro and it cannot be. In fact, his newest film has everything that would have made a great gothic thriller  great visuals with creepy atmosphere, and talented cast including Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain. But somehow the result is a little disappointing probably because, well, haven't we heard a similar story before?

Mia Wasikowska is Edith Cushing, a young and nave girl living in 19th century Buffalo, aspiring to be a writer, and she is the only daughter of a rich and powerful family. One day Edith meets Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), a charming English baronet trying to find an investor. Does she fall in love with him? The answer is too obvious from the beginning.

In the meanwhile Edith sees strange apparitions that seem to warn her of something evil, something that is related to Crimson Peak. So what awaits her? Again, the answer is predictable, something that is not very interesting.

Crimson Peak is a decent thriller in the vein of British classic novels (like Jane Eyre and of course Rebecca) told with self-conscious wit. But we naturally expect something more than just decent from the creator of Pan's Labyrinth and sadly, with the supernatural elements that are too weak, and the characters that are only one dimensional, we just don't get it here.

7720701,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"What kind of monster kills a dog and burns someones manuscript?!? That is just wrong.

I don't watch or read a lot of gothic horror, and Im not really sure why, since I often find myself enjoying them. From the previews I was hesitant because it looked like Edith (Mia Wasikowska) was just running around the ancient mansion trying to escape creepy ghosts, but there was so much more to this movie. We don't even get to the mansion until almost halfway through.

Edith is an aspiring writer who believes she will get published because her father has raised as a strong woman who believes in herself. But she is still young, so she is easily swept away when a stranger, Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) comes to America looking to have his invention financed.

The scenery, architecture and costumes throughout the film are gorgeous. The details are exquisite, and when we are finally inside the decrepit mansion, the layering of decay over extravagance is done perfectly.

Spoilers Ahead.

You know pretty much from the start that Thomas and his sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), are not good people. But the build up as to exactly how and why, is very well done.
Also, since this is a gothic story there are going to be family secrets. When Lucille and Edith were talking about if the marriage had been consummated, I knew there was going to be incest. When we are finally shown, it is done in a very sensual and tasteful way. The fact that Edith sees it with her own two eyes and still doesnt believe it, continues to show her naivete.

The exploration of half-truths, lies and nothing being what it seems is played over and over again in perfect harmony. Just when one of the characters thinks something, there is a slight change in perspective that shifts everything, leaving the actor and audience slightly off balance.

This is a very well done gothic horror/romance, and if you enjoyed The Haunting (1999 or 1963), or the TV show, Penny Dreadful, I think youll find this one to your liking as well.",1457308800,,2009,4.674220963172805

Parents advisory: there were only 2 scenes that had sexual activity. One was a pretty intense love making scene. It didn't last long but the guys butt was totally exposed and some major thrusting. **SPOILER ALERT** There was also a scene, incestual, where the brother and sister are sitting on the end of the bed, kissing and the sister has her hands down the front of the brothers unzipped pants.",1457308800,,564,4.280373831775701

This movie was much more character-driven (and therefore satisfying) than any flat horror movie I have ever seen. The film sets are absolutely stunning and the actors were well-cast. I found the heroine too naive, but that is part of the Gothic genre. My least favorite part of the film was how cheap & CGI the ghosts looked. They were not even designed to be ""believable"" in the typical ghost appearance, so they were just distracting and pulled you from the ambiance of the beautiful setting.

7720802,4,B01DOQAKUQ,Guillermo Del Toro is one of the most creative and talented director/producers out there. He never ceases to amaze me and he didn't come up short with Crimson peak. The costumes and scenery were to die for while the story was creepy and unsettling. If you are a fan of Del Toro's work I'd highly recommend this.,1456876800,,311,4.473684210526316

The ghosts weren't very scary at all. In fact they were animated. Why? It was Scooby Doo grade. I wanted to be scared, or at least surprised. If the ghosts could've been more lifelike that would've been awesome. I couldn't stop thinking on how this film had so much potential, or how it could have been an excellent mini series.  It was between a Bronte and Burton feel.",1456790400,,541,4.520408163265306

7720808,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"Lots of eye candy in this film, so I'll give it that much. Everyone was pretty -- except Jim Beaver, who is awesome and brings his own touch of class to his projects.

It seemed unnecessarily bloody, though, and ... I don't know, just kind of boring and predictable. I feel like I knew the ending within the first half hour or so, and it wasn't even a particularly fun journey to that ending. I get that people want to see the blood, and the sexual taboo stuff is really appealing to viewers, so if that's your kind of thing? Go for it.

7720816,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"I really enjoyed watching this film. It definitely kept my interest through the entire movie.  Beautiful Gothic horror. Some reviewers might say it was predictable,  but I would argue that it makes good use of foreshadowing and building dread and suspicion in the viewer, which gives a sense of satisfaction when your suspicions are realized as the story unfolds.",1456704000,,363,5.135593220338983

I get that it was supposed to be a Victorian/Gothic romance/horror story. But everything surrounding that plot was way bigger, and over the top. This left me waiting for something more, and that didn't really happen. The buildup was much stronger than the story itself. A little more subtlety would have made it a dead-on match. Overall, I'd happily watch it again. It was so beautiful that it was distracting at times.",1456704000,,535,5.090909090909091

So let's keep it short and sweet shall we then okay the story has been played out more times than I would like it's just the same haunted house story girl falls for boy...boy takes girl to live to the house...the house starts to warn her by haunting her...boring special effects...predictable story...boring ending...my advice as a horror movie fan...I can honestly say that if I were you I would save my money...but if you truly are interested rent it for cheap and hey you may like it...I honestly didn't kinda wish I got my money back but hey that's just my opinion.",1456704000,4,799,4.4353741496598635

It is a shame that this film was also let down by the Amazon streaming service.  Even though I paid for the HD version of this rental, I was forced to watch this in SD. I'm still not sure why there is no buffering feature available for Amazon Prime.

It's an interesting house it serves no purpose.  You can frost a turd and make it look like a Wedding Cake but....this movie is still a TURD.

Jessica Chastain played the Mrs. Danvers part perfectly (younger viewers see Rebecca) that blend of creepy and downright wacko.

This director is amazing as he fine tunes every element of this film.

#1 Why is everything leaking? I get that there is mud, or clay, or whatever the substance is, but why is it coming out of the walls?

#2 Why couldn't they do something about that roof? I understand the urgency to get the machine running (actually I don't) but couldn't they have shelled out a few dollars for a roof. A proper lady with money would have taken one look and dipped.

#3 What's going on with the moths? It's WAY too cold for them to survive, and what was their purpose?

#4 Charlie Hunnam's accent was killing me.

#5 Thank God Mia Wasikowska doesn't have broad shoulders, because those puffy sleeves would have been the end of a career for a women like Joan Crawford.

#6 Where is the plot? I have one of the best imaginations I know, I was on board with Pan's Labyrinth, that was a magical movie in Spanish and made more sense without the subtitles then this movie did in my native language.

Mia Wasikowska is lovely as the thin, pale American conquest. I love everything she does - such a talented lady.

I won't give away too much of the plot as it would ruin the story, but it's a girl meets boy/dad hates boy/boy wins and steals girl away/girl is creeped out by mysterious house/almost everyone dies story.

7720931,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"I really like Guillermo del Toro's films alot.  His visions and designs are usually very surreal, but somehow they still seem to fit in the world we know, and Crimson Peak is no exception.  Everything from the design of the English manor to the appearance and movement of the apparitions were amazing to watch and much of it left a sense of real dread, but at the same time left me craving more.  However, even del Toro's vivid creations weren't enough to raise this movie from mediocrity.  Instead we get yet another version of a story we've already seen a dozen times before.  Maybe it's because I was looking for an actual horror movie, but instead was served a supernatural love story (I think its a stretch to call this a mystery).  I just kept wanting this movie to be more than it ended up being.  The most frustrating thing is that there actually are a couple of truly spine-tingling moments where del Toro shows off his horror chops.  But these are so few and so far between that any sense of dread that was built had already dissipated.  Instead of one long roller coaster ride, it felt like a series of single hill roller coasters with a waiting line between each ride.

Sounds good in the teaser, but this is not a movie about ghosts, it is a film about a girl whose father dies and the mystery of how he died. Her life is then even more complicated by a new marriage to a man she hardly knows who lives in an isolated mansion with his abusive sister. The mansion itself is bizarre which adds to the mystery, but this is not a horror movie by any stretch. Amazon lists it as a supernatural mystery. I would call it a period piece with a few things that go bump in the night.

7720940,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"This is coming from a horror freak who grew up on Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, and who got on the Guillermo Del Toro bus early on in his career, with the Devil's Backbone. The Orphanage, as well as his magnum opus: Pan's Labyrinth, left me in awe of him. Since then, I've been seriously underwhelmed.  Super disappointed, after this one. I was excited when I saw it was supposed to be mature themed (no kid protagonists, like in his last 2, which undermined them, IMO). That lasted until shortly after my first and only thrill: when I heard Jax Teller's voice for the first time, and thought it would be a hoot to see that actor in a gothic horror piece. Sadly, this ""gothic horror"" barely kept my attention, evidenced by me deciding midway through, it was as good a time as any to scrub stains out of the carpet.  Guillermo, Guillermo, what gives? Have you abandoned your adult horror buffs?  It feels like when Clive Barker jumped ship and started writing fantasy novels.

Even the visuals, which are about the only thing anyone might find novel in this movie, totally lacked the flourishes of realism (surreal realism, of course) that blew me away in Pan's. Not a fan of CGI, myself, because of the ""cartoon effect"", which was all I got watching this. Not the sort of impression I expected from horror, but what I've come to expect from GDT as of late. The characters were cardboard cut outs, and the story a Cliff Note's version of any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation. Except the Vincent Price era Fall of the House of Usher was far more convincing and engaging than this. I've seen this tale before, so many times I could write one myself, and there was nothing-- nada---zero-- that made this re-telling memorable. Bottom line: Lackluster and boring.

With its lavish costumes, well-performed acting, horrifying make-up and effects, and gothic settings, everything blended together perfectly! Mia Wasikowska (Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland) gave an incredible performance as main protagonist, Edith Cushing; Tom Hiddleston (The Avengers), Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty, Mama), and Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) also brought life to this work of art with their acting.

Even though this film didn't gain as much of a boom in the box office that I thought it deserved, Crimson Peak is one of those films that give a perfect mix of romance, mystery, murder, and tragedy.",1455926400,,885,5.359712230215828

7720952,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"Though this film came out in October of 2015, it's not really a horror film, though it's billed as such.  This movie is more of a Gothic Romance with bits of horror, or ghosts, thrown into the batch to give the movie more flavor to the Halloween crowd.

The story takes place in both America and England during the late 1800's.

When Tom Hiddleton and his sister, Jessica Chastain (with black hair) visit Mia Wasikowska's father in America in the hope of raising funds for a mining venture, Hiddleston is turned down by the great Jim Beaver.  Wasikowska, however, falls in love with Hiddleton during the time he is there and woos her with his love of horror stories.  When her father is brutally murdered, she quickly marries Hiddleton's character and moves to England to be with him and his sister at their estate.

Of course, once Wasikowska arrives at the estates, she's told not to venture down to the basement for any reason.  This only sparks her curiosity and entices her to do the no-no.  In time, she begins the see ghosts as she once did as a child.  Are the ghosts evil, or are they seeking to warn her against upcoming danger?

You'll have to see the movie to find out.

I will say that the film was brilliantly filmed with colors that clearly stand out and transform the production into an array of magnificent features with everything from the clothes, the hair color, the inside and outside of the estate, and the colors of the various ghosts turn this into something that literally has to be watched.  As an example, the estate in England, though masking the horror's of murder, is surrounded by beautiful white snow along the sides and in parts of the front..  The majority of the front, however, is red from the blood that has seeped into the clay below ground.  You therefore have the contrasting colors of red and white and the darkness of the Gothic house seeking your attention with every shot of the camera.

The story line is a fairly simple one with Hiddleton dressed in black and his sister at times dressed in red and black outfits.  Just from the actions and looks of the sister, we instinctively know they are a bad pair of siblings and that one had better watch out.  I didn't even recognize Mia Wasikowska from The November Man with her red hair, glasses, and period costumes.  She was an innocent; yet, utterly enchanting to watch in her performance as the main character.  You could understand why so many men wanted her in matrimony.  It even explains why Hiddleton eventually falls in love with her and has to question his motives and his love for his sister.

The is certainly a film that's breath-taking to behold, but with a story line that's somewhat simple in its application.  Of course, when viewed as a Gothic Romance, the ending is indeed perfect.  The film reminds me somewhat of the earlier Lady in Black from a few years ago.  Suspecting what the ending might be doesn', however, lessen the enjoyment of the journey.  The performances are excellent, the settings perfect, and the photography truly exquisite.

My only question now is when will Guillermo Del Toro being doing an actual monster movie.  He has the talent to carry it off.  I suppose one only has to be patient.",1455926400,4,3221,4.623239436619718
7720953,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Many people say bad things about this film. I say this is a great film not just because of the production design only but becasue of the rarely great actor Tom Hiddleston. He was in the other movies <Thor> <Thor: The Dark World> <The Avengers> all as the same charactor, Loki, the second son who can never be the king and becomes a villain. He has this rare face and charactor that not many, or if I may say none, actors has.
He has two faces. The evil vs good, the fragile vs strong, and so on. Not even the great actors like Robert De Nero or Dustin Hofman has that kind of talent. But he does.
Now that he finally has this great roll, he did it so wonderfully that I was almost cry with tears.
Tom Hiddleston and his sister Jessica Chastain had a sick mother who had grudge with Mia Wasikowska's family, espetially withe her father.
Now that their mother died, they decided to revenge by Tom marrying with Mia and take all the money. Also Jessica killes Mia's father to do so.
While the process, Tom truely falls in love with Mia and I mean really falls in love.
But on the other hand, he had this strange relationship with his sister, sexual relationship that cannot be broken.
He is agonizing from his sister and his wife Mia after he got married with Mia since he knows his sister is killing Mia slowly by poisoning her- she puts the poison inside the tea everyday and serves her to kill her slowly.
But as time goes by he feels how much he loves Mia.
Now we can see how truely great actor the  Tom Hiddleston is. His true agonizing can be shown and that moment was so beautiful to watch.
His eyes were so pure and sorrowful that I almost was sucked into his eyes even though I am a man myself.
As I told you before, the house of Tom and his sister's is a true charactor iteself and it was decorated beautifully but that is just a part of the movie that makes the movie shine.
It is again to be said that  Tom Hiddleston's acting and his charactor that is the best thing in this film and the true discovery.
His acting was memorable and should be recognized from somewhere at least from someone from the film festival.
Mia Wasikowska was good but her charactor was 2 dimentional and Jessica Chastain was also good but her charactor was 1 dimentional. I couldn't see other charactor at all because of Tom. His acting is to say 3 dimantional.
I remember the house of Tom and his sister in one scene - because there's a huge hole on the ceiling, there are snow falling down from the top and there are Mia and Tom facing each other. There are snow falling down from the sky moonlight shining at the same time, as if the snow are stars falling from the sky. That shot was so beautiful that my eyes were almost become blind.
This movie should have been re-recognized and people should not watch this film as a gothic horror film only.
It is rather a love story based on the well known novel like Wuthering Heights. In the story Wuthering Heights, there are two families having grudge for years because of the love between two people that shouldn't be. The ending was a sad sad one.
This movie's ending was also a sad one but not all sad because Mia was saved by the man who admired her from the beginning. Although Tom and his sister died finally.
This is the movie to be recognized not as a horror film but as a sad love story - if I may quote once more.

He served as executive producer on one of the best ghost stories ever put to screen--""The Orphanage.""  A good ghost story seems to be his niche.  That being said, his mark was a little off for ""Crimson Peak.""

""Crimson Peak"" is a tale of murder, revenge, and (believe it or not) love.  Mia Wasikowska plays the principle role of a budding young girl who desires desperately to become a writer, but cannot seem to be taken seriously by a then-run male business.  Her father is some sort of construction big wig who has a meeting with two shady characters seeking funding for a new machine they have concocted.  He seeks the employ of a private detective to investigate them because the man seems to be head over heels in love with his daughter.  That's when the trouble starts.

I do not know if it was just me, but this movie seemed ""lacking"" is some way.  The costumes were wonderful, the scenery and sets wonderful, camera angles great, the use of colors were terrific, and del Torro's overall direction was (gasp) adequate.  However, since I know him for being involved in some of the best ghost stories, this one just did not deliver.  I was never scared--never felt a sense of dread, nor did I really feel anything for Ms. Wasikowska's character.  I knew what was going on from the beginning.  All this seemed to do (for me) was to tell a minimally decent ghost story.

This movie is rated ""R"" for violence, scary images, brief nudity, and simulated sex.  However, if you think you're going to get a screen awash in blood, you will be severely disappointed.  This one was a close call for me, but I would recommend it.",1455840000,,1959,4.6725146198830405

7720973,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"Looking for a horror flick to play on Valentine's Day? Here's your movie! Crimson Peak hearkens back to the days of Hammer Films in that it is a treat for the eyes and it has many Gothic horror elements in the story. The story begins with Edith (Mia Wasikowska) who believes in ghosts because her mother's ghost visited her as a child and warned her against going to Crimson Peak. Edith grows up to become a writer, but she is having a lot of trouble getting published because it's the Victorian era and her penmanship keeps giving her away as a female writer. Her father (Jim Beaver), a wealthy industrialist, is entertaining a pitch from an English baronet named Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who wants capital to mine the unique red clay on his estate back in England. Take a wild guess what that estate's nickname is? Anyway, it's no spoiler to say that he begins to woo Edith in earnest, and through a nefarious turn of events is able to bring her back to his estate as his bride, where his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) rules the manor. Meanwhile back on the homefront, Edith's friend and would-be suitor Dr. McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) grows suspicious and starts digging. Classic Gothic story-line. Guillermo del Toro brings his marvelous sense of visuals to the table as well; the colors pop in in a blend of dynamic primaries and rich quaternaries. It is a beautiful movie to behold, even when the blood inevitably begins to flow. The horror is not really gory though, despite a heart-thumping set piece at the end. Neither is it primarily supernatural, although there are most definitely ghosts in this movie. The main source of horror is classic Gothic stuff: family secrets, romantic entanglements, and terrible lies. Speaking of the romance, there's not just one, but three that set up the falling action in the plot. More really, if you count - but no, I won't spoil it. Even though you'll probably guess at least one before the end of the movie.",1455753600,2,1965,4.7317784256559765

7721037,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"With movies like this that promote it as a scary horror movie that will knock your socks off, you have to see it for yourself to make a judgment call. I did just that in October, around Halloween. I knew going in that it was going to be more like a gothic creepy style movie, not one to just cut and splatter every few minutes. I thought the storyline was decent, but the pace was a bit slow. The actors and actresses did a decent job with the script they were given and it did show on the screen. The main plot of the movie is basically, the brother and sister are in dire need of $ and they seek out ""Mia's"" character, with whom her father is wealthy and well known. Tom Hiddleson and Jessica Chastain are the brother and sister and they live in a ""rotting"" and broken down estate, literally sinking in the red clay ""dirt"" that surrounds the entire place.
The only ghost we see in the beginning of the movie is that of Mia's ""mother"" warning her of the impending doom if she goes to Crimson Peak and once again when she is alone in a bedroom. Then near the end of the movie, we see ""Tom Hiddleson's"" character as a ghost that appears to ""Mia"".

Even woman in the Victorian age weren't that stupid. This is overdone gothic, with emphasis on the special effects like most modern movies. Gothics were scary, but it was all in the mind.

7721068,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"Fairly creepy. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but then the bar has been set fairly high by Del Toro. The scenes can be vibrant and, at the same time, dreery and overcast. The special effects are spot on, and some great gore shots. The filmmaker doesn't really do much to dilute your impressions of characters from the start, but then, there is also a couple surprises and a bit of redemption. All-in-all, I would say worth a watch. Not the best horror movie you'll see this year, I'd wager, but the theme and tone of the movie, as well as the set pieces, make it a worthwhile viewing.",1455580800,,586,4.385321100917431

7721072,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"I have to say I was sorely disappointed by this film. I love a good gothic ghost story, add in the fact that it's directed by one of the most imaginative directors' working today in Guillermo Del Toro, plus a fantastic cast featuring Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain and Charlie Hunnam, I figured ""Crimson Peak"" would be a must-own DVD.

As the film opens we see that a young girl, Edith, has lost her mother. Soon after the graveside service ends, Edith is haunted by her mother's spirit telling the young girl to beware of Crimson Peak. Jump ahead about 20 years and Edith is now living in Buffalo, New York, writing Gothic Horror stories even though her publisher wished she would write romance novels. It's not long before a dashing young man from England, Thomas Sharpe, arrives hoping to land some new investors in his business. Thomas, and his sister, Lucille, live on an estate in England with dark red soil, that is well suited for brick making. Instead of investors, Sharp finds Edith and the two soon fall in love, despite the misgivings of Edith's father, and Thomas' sister. Soon Edith finds herself whisked across the Atlantic, taking up residence in the run-down estate which takes it's name from the red clay it's built upon, Crimson Peak.

For me the movie goes off the rails pretty quickly when the CGI smoke swirls around the ghost of Edith's mother. There is nothing suspenseful about watching cartoon mist, and honestly CGI really hasn't improved over the horrible F/X seen in the awful remake of ""The Haunting"" in 1999. The actual gothic manor of Crimson Peak, what we see of it, is almost laughably dumb. There is a giant hole in the middle of the house. A huge hole that lets in leaves and rain and snow? This is just stupid. I can almost believe people would stay in a haunted house, but a house with a gaping hole in it's roof? A house built upon ""perfect"" brick building material, and yet no one thinks to cover the hole?

Charlie Hunnam is totally wasted, and probably just wanted to work with Del Toro again after ""Pacific Rim"". Actually the only character that is allowed to stretch and chew up some scenery is Jessica Chastain as Lucille. Most of the cast just seems to wander around in a state of melancholy as we wait for the next CGI ghost to pop out of the floor.

""Crimson Peak"" is just a dull, boring mess.",1455580800,,2343,4.571428571428571
7721073,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"I am a huge fan of Del Toro's but the story he was trying to telll seems forced, like 10 pounds of movie in a 5 pound bag.",1455580800,,122,3.392857142857143
7721074,2,B01DOQAKUQ,No real surprises here. Most of the scares are computer generated red skeletons. Boring!,1455580800,,88,5.357142857142857
7721075,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"I'm a del Torro fan.  This is a movie, and story that happens to have ghosts in it in a thoughtful, spooky, and sometimes frightening way.  Its not an all out blood and guts slasher horror movie, but has a few of these elements.  A great haunting movie that leaves you wanting to know more on the backstory.",1455580800,,307,4.258620689655173

7721078,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"Breathtakingly beautiful and just a touch otherworldly in every shot, worth seeing for the sheer visual pleasure it provides. Performances were compelling. However, the story itself is thin and rather formulaic. Nothing out of expected ever happens, and apart from two central characters, every other one could have been left out without hurting the dynamics and motivations. And when I say central characters, protagonist girl was not one of them. She is not as much of a heroin of the story; rather she is a plot device used to start the story and move it forward. While Mia Wasikowska was born to stumble around Victorian mansions, the character itself could have been replaced with a box of cue cards. Main characters are the brother, sister and the house. To be honest, there are more interesting stories to be told about these three, and all of them happened before we get involved in the story. I'd like to see about ten prequels with Tom Hiddleston at his more devious and Jessica Chastain at her even more simmering- madness - well-restrained. She is the biggest master of the craft here, from the first to the last moment. With a very little she creates a depth to the character that is compelling, intriguing and ever more interesting the less is explained.

The house itself is a great character, living, breathing and filled with the things you can only see from the corner of the eye.

If you have noticed the lack of ghosts in this review, that's because they don't provide much more than some amazingly weird and beautifully off visuals. This is not a ghost story let alone a scary one, even if it might provide a chill or two. It's a gorgeous, pulpy, gothic romance. And the romance  could have been left out to tell a more interesting, extraordinary story and bring this piece of visual art to a higher level of movie making. So, so many stories happened to those people in that house.... I really wish we could have seen more than a glimpse of one of them...",1455580800,,1977,4.659025787965616

7721081,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"Just what you would expect from Guillermo del Toro.  Visually stunning, gorgeous period costumes, just enough creep to be scary but not overdone.  Tom Hiddleston fans shouldn't be disappointed as he yet again manages to look handsome even as he's committing terrible deeds.  Jessica Chastain also pulls off her role as the conniving, jealous, homicidal sister.  Would not have expected to see her in that type of role but she does a great job.  Mia Wasikowska's role is eerily similar to the one she played in Jane Eyre and this will not be lost on those who are familiar with the Bronte novel or any of its film productions.  Pan's Labyrinth is still my favorite del Toro film but this ranks as a close second.",1455580800,,711,4.648

7721100,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"More psychological thriller than scary horror. As such, the gore is over the top in my opinion. It felt like the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be, a horror movie, a love story or a suspense. It settled on a jarring combination of the 3. The movie started out very slowly. Boy loves girl. Girl knows but doesn't care. New boy enters picture. Girl falls in love under eye of disapproving father. Yawn. The pace finally picked up toward the end but by then, I'd lost interest.

7721187,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"Just barely okay, and only because Jessica Chastain is demonically brilliant and lifts every scene she's in. Otherwise you'd have to be a deep Del Toro groupie -- of whom there are obviously many -- not to think this is a droopy sludge through a whole lot of cliches and far from surprising twists. Once again he gives us cartoony CGI characters doing jazz hands. Ho hum. The screenplay he co-wrote is bland, illogical, and lousy with references to former, better films -- not to mention lacking in suspense, thrills or chills except for an obligatory gotcha scene or two. Mia W is okay but not strong enough to carry a film on her own. Which is how the immensely more vibrant Chastain steals her blind in every scene they share, completely dominating this movie whether she's chasing Mia with a meat cleaver or just twitching an eyelid in seething rage. She's both scary and hilarious, and the only reason to watch this otherwise pedestrian drag of a film.",1455408000,2,957,4.668639053254438

There's a great creepy erotic goth movie somewhere in here somewhere but I think GDT got too hung up on the visuals and the storytelling suffered.  Edith starts out as a spunky young woman and turns into an idiot.  Why would she even stay a minute in that decaying old house?  There is zero chemistry between her and Thomas (one note performance from Hiddlestone) and why they are instantly in love with each other remains a mystery to me.

7721193,1,B01DOQAKUQ,"I love slow-moving tales, sumptuous set design, and intriguing mysteries. Crimson Peak has none of this. First off, the set design. It's so over-the-top that it's cartoonish. The CG ghosts are just too much, too much given away, too much everything.

The acting from EVERYONE in this movie is wooden. I hate Thomas because I never once got the sense that he was in love with Edith, even at the end when he supposedly couldn't go through with his dastardly plan. He is so wishy washy, such a milquetoast. The sister is appropriately evil, I suppose, but I think I would've preferred it if Thomas was just as evil because he does nothing in this movie, nothing at all. He just whines to his sister. ""Do we have to kill my wife? I kinda like this one!""

Maybe if he were a little more tortured? Or something, anything. Give me more than a blank stare, please, Thomas.

Dead babies, dead dogs, and I can't even really get incensed over it because it's just so stupid. They killed the dog! And the baby! Which normally rustles my jimmies but this story is so emotionless, so boring that I don't even care.

This is just bad writing and bad acting all played out in a Scooby Doo mansion. I love Rebecca. I loved Woman in Black. This movie should've been tailor made for me but I'm so glad I just rented it instead of blind buying it.

The ghost effects are eerie & very well done. The acting here was great also, especially Tom Hiddleston & Jessica Chastain. Basic plot is an English aristocrat comes to America to raise funds, falls in love & marries then the couple move back to England to the family manor where strange supernatural things occur (don't want to give away to much of the story). If you enjoy the stories of say Edgar Allan Poe you will absolutely love this movie. Its got a lot of themes running through it & a twist ending also. I had read a few mixed things about the film before buying but decided to get it anyway since ive loved everything Del Toro has directed so far & am so glad I did, it was well worth it. Extras include commentary, deleted scenes & some interviews & making of features. All in all if you already enjoy Del Toro's work, like gothic style horror or just great movies with atmosphere then I fell youll really enjoy Crimson Peak.",1455321600,,1092,4.465

Crimson Peak describes itself as a ""Gothic romance"", and the movie attempts to combine historical fiction, with romance and horror.  Surprisingly, the movie succeeds, and stands out in all three categories.  This is no doubt thanks to a very strong cast, and excellent screen writing.  Mia Wasikowska is fantastic as a courageous yet worldly unwise daughter of a steam age industrialist.  Tom Hiddleston plays male lead as a Baronet from England seeking investors in his inventions, who catches the interest of Mia's character.  Cinephiles are likely to recognize themes and plot devices from a variety of other stories, but the movie manages to be engaging (and decidedly creepy in parts) in spite of that.  Personally, I thought the supernatural visual effects were great as well.",1455235200,,1057,4.8277777777777775

It left me wanting a sequel so desperately....for the story not to end, like all of his work!",1455235200,,290,4.290909090909091
7721206,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"""Crimson Peak"" is great! This is how the story goes: In the aftermath of a family tragedy, an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider. Trying to escape the ghosts of her past, she is swept away to a house that breathes, bleeds - and remembers.

The cast led by Mia Wasikowska (as Edith Cushing), Jessica Chastain (as Lucille Sharpe), Tom Hiddleston (as Thomas Sharpe), Charlie Hunnam (as Alan McMichael) & Jim Beaver (as Carter Cushing) is great. The directing by Guillermo del Toro (who also produced and co-wrote the story & screenplay) is great. The story & screenplay by del Toro & Matthew Robbins is great.

The music by Fernando Velazquez is great. The cinematography by Dan Laustsen is great. The film editing by Bernat Vilaplana is great. The casting by Robin D. Cook is great. The production design by Tom Sanders is great. The art direction by Brandt Gordon is great. The set decoration by Jeffrey A. Melvin & Shane Vieau, set designs by William Cheng, David G. Fremlin, Aleks Marinkovich, Russell Douglas Moore, Sorin Popescu, Michael Madden, Matt Middleton, Andra Totirescu & Evan Webber and set dressings by Carlos Caneca, Brenton Brown, Alexander Kutschera, Jeffrey W. Poulis, Keith Sly, Don McQueen & Toni Wong is great. The costume design by Kate Hawley is great. The make-up effects designed by Daniel Carrasco, David Marti & Montse Ribe is great. The stunts coordinated by Branko Racki is great. The special effects supervised by Michael Innanen & coordinated by Rocco Larizza & Laird McMurray is great. The visual effects supervised by Dennis Berardi & coordinated by Danni Henderson, Nick Colangelo, Becca Donohoe, Jenn Inkol, Natalie Broomhall, Alina Klinaeva & Karen McGregor is great.

This is a solidly, well-crafted, entertaining and beautiful-looking gothic horror / thriller that is well-made and intriguing. Mia Wasikowska gives a solid performance as Edith, Jessica Chastain is devilishly creepy as Lucille & Tom Hiddleston is also solid and with an air of devilish to him as Thomas. Guillermo del Toro has made another impressively crafted film to his superb resume. This is one of the better horror thrillers in recent memory and one of the best looking horror thrillers in recent memory, as well, too.",1455235200,,2299,5.060686015831134
7721207,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"This is a tale of ghosts, love, and murder. It's not anything to highly praise, maybe because there really isn't anything that I thought was terrifying.  At least there was a different take on what ghosts look like. The movie begins with a narrative from Edith, a perky young woman who is charmed by an English stranger, an inventor, who comes to America to promote his invention to her industrialist father. After being swept off her feet, Edith ends up marrying this guy. Meanwhile, her father hires a private investigator who discovers things that anger him, and he therefore is determined to keep the young man away from Edith. However, Edith's father is murdered in a private club. The rest of the movie was not as impressive as I thought it would be, although there is a touching moment or two, and the acting was very good.

7721215,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"The visuals in this are truly amazing.  From the look of the mangled ghosts to the distinctive red clay, and of course the Crimson Peak estate itself, nearly every scene just begs for something creepy to happen.  Too bad the story just doesn't cooperate.  For one thing, it takes us entirely too long to get to the Peak in the first place (almost an hour!) because we're busy following Mia Wasikowska's character through society.  We get that she's pretty progressive, an aspiring writer, not into parties, etc.  Naturally, the only thing she's missing is a guy to fall head over heels for after maybe two conversations.  After that it's kind of a mess.  The villains are revealed much too early while our protagonist remains blissfully ignorant.  This kills pretty much all the suspense, and turns a bland heroine into a rather stupid looking one.  To make things worse, clues are dropped left and right about what kind of game the antagonists are up to.  It's not even subtle; they have entire conversations about it right at the breakfast table, and it's not that hard to fill in any details they do omit.  That kills the rest of the suspense.  By the time all was revealed not all the awesome looking ghosts and red snow in the world could have made me happy.  On a more positive note, Jessica Chastain was absolutely wonderful and her character would have benefited from a little more backstory.",1455062400,13,1400,4.711934156378601

What makes this movie so good is Del Toro has taken all the elements of a genre that we are all familiar with and crafted a film that embodies that genre.  Del Toros  directing panache, opulent sets, costumes and spot-on casting makes this film a classic that I will watch again and again.

7721229,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Absolutely stunning movie. Yet another win by Guillermo Del Toro. The setting, the season, the spooky mansion, the actor selection, the story, the attention to detail in the costumes is spectacular. It's so nice to see Jim Beaver in this movie. He is resurrected from Dead Wood, Supernatural to get brutally murdered yet again here in Crimson Peak, but it was nice to see him. And who doesn't like to see Charlie Hunnam? No one. This film is five stars for everything- with a seriously naughty, sick twist in the end. Siblings....who knew?

7721234,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"More of a tragic romance than a horror film, still very well crafted though. Very well crafted. It's more of a gothic period-piece than anything else. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but didn't quite realize it until the end. My original perception prior to watching it was ""I'm in store for a great new horror flick, from Del Torro no less! This is gonna' be incredibly scary..."" It was in no way a top notch horror film, but when adding the cinematography, a well crafted (yet unoriginal) story and screenplay with great young starring talent it turns out ok. It was overly marketed as a horror film so that's what I expected, and even in slight of it not being what it was advertised to be (in my opinion) it was still a well done film.",1454976000,6,732,4.42962962962963

She was overacting and it became annoying. Charlie Hunnam was severely underutilized but Tom Hiddleston was great. Mia Wasikowska was just ""ok"". There could have been many different scenes in this movie that could have injected jump scares, frightening images, sinister music, etc., but those were almost non-existent. I'm only giving this movie a 3/5 because the production was high and I liked the actors in the movie. Some of the story was interesting but once you figure out the main reason for the antagonists doing what they do...it's a big letdown.",1454976000,6,720,5.0588235294117645

After the death of her father she marries Thomas and returns with him to a mysterious house that holds secrets of the past. I am not a huge horror movie fan, but I was looking forward to this one because I do like Guillermo del Toro movies. That said, I was a little disappointed in this one. The movie was just a little too slow moving for me. I loved Pan's Labyrinth and the horror movies he has produced like Mama and Splice but I really just couldn't get into this one. I'm not saying this was a bad movie because it was good and the acting was great. The movie relied on psychological horror rather than jump scares or gore, but there was just something missing for me to be able to get fully involved in.

7721254,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"I'll admit that I was mostly drawn to this movie because of Tom Hiddleston, but I also liked that it was a Gothic romance. I'm not sure what I was expecting from it really, but it turned out to be absolutely amazing. This movie is dark, romantic, gory, strange, and, above all, unique.

I was literally glued to the screen and you need to be to catch everything. I loved that the movie makers added the little fade out shots like those seen in old movies - it was a really nice touch.

Tom Hiddleston is remarkable in this movie. He's dark, elusive, mysterious, and incredibly sexy. The sex scene in this film is short, but so, so good.

I really cannot say enough about this movie. If you love dark mysteries and Gothic romance, you're going to LOVE this movie.

WARNING: This movie has some extremely gory scenes. I've watched tons of horror movies and this stands above most of those for the gore.",1454803200,,900,4.4363636363636365
7721255,3,B01DOQAKUQ,It was OK.,1454803200,,10,2.6666666666666665
7721256,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"The Good:

The visuals in this movie are beyond captivating. You're either going to be too afraid of the ghost(s) to look, or too intrigued by their unique designs to turn away. Director Guillermo del Toro is simply genius with his unique, artistic and beautiful portrayal of the ghosts. Tom Hiddleston does a really nice job in this film, but Jessica Chastain easily has the strongest performance. There are some really scary moments in the first half of the movie, and you can expect some creepy scenes that are similar to the movie Insidious.

The Bad:

A consistent flaw with del Toro's amazing visuals is that in the majority of his horror films (Mama, for example) he erases the sense of horror the closer you get to the end of the movie. He'll do a terrific job of introducing and subtly showing you the ghosts/monsters, but towards the end of the movie he'll show you entirely too much. By the time you see all of the ghost, it's just not as scary anymore, and there's nothing left to the imagination. This film was no exception. Matter of fact, the movie completely transforms into a different genre after the halfway point. It goes from horror to slasher-thriller. The downfall with this is that while you're no longer busy focusing on being afraid of the ghosts, you begin to pay more attention at all of the MANY plot holes in the story. There are a number of issues in the story that seem like convenient writing, or lack of creativity, just to hurry the movie along.

The Reason:

If you're a fan of del Toro's work in projects like The Strain, Mama, or Pan's Labrynth, you'll be sure to notice that del Toro recycles a lot of the same things in this movies. (i.e.: long crooked fingers, fast moving monsters, moths, or even floating ghosts in the air) Despite the similarities, del Toro still never ceases to amaze you visually speaking. That in itself makes Crimson Peak worth the watch in the theaters. Actors are good, story is ""meh"", and the ghosts are really cool to look at. As I mentioned, the movie does go from horror to thriller, but the trailer sells this as if it's only a horror. So I'm just giving you the heads up now so you don't go in thinking it'll be a complete scary film. Matinee price is all that you'll need spend to watch this.

The Rating: 7.0/10

7721260,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"I saw this in theaters last October and while this wasn't the absolutely greatest film I've ever seen (I didn't cry or scream or anything), it was still wildly entertaining and had absolutely killer visuals and a good story. The 19th century is a particularly interesting period to me, so the setting and costumes and all that stuff was an instant draw for me. I'm not usually big on horror, but somehow this (outside of the ghosts) was realistic horror I could see happening in 19th century England and it wasn't just a giant wash of blood and guts and violence. I also liked how there was a little romance and redemption and that the villain wasn't wholly evil without reason or care. The characters were great too and I was satisfied with the ending.

I honestly have nothing negative to say about this movie other than that some of the horror/visuals were a little creepy and unsettling (which was probably the point so...) A really great throwback to the Gothic romance in a film format! Definitely worth your time if you're into period pieces and can stomach some horror and dark subject matters.

Overall, I recommend seeing it at least once!",1454630400,2,1149,4.683168316831683

Guillermo Del Toro is a master of fine detail, and each time you watch this movie, you will see things you missed before.  Doug Jones, master of ""creepy hands"" appears as a couple of different ghosts, adding to the beautiful spookiness of this film.
Also, for once, we get to see Charlie Hunnam act without taking off any of his clothing!  I mean, the boy has a nice bod, but we don't HAVE to see it in EVERY movie or TV show, do we? He's also a pretty talented actor, and keeping his clothes on makes that more evident. (Your mileage may vary)",1454630400,2,636,4.372881355932203

The camera never seems to be at a low enough angle, and it tends to move around in ways that don't tell you anything.  The suspense is, well, unsuspenseful.

7721305,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"I first saw the previews for this film a good two weeks before it came out -- mostly because I live under a rock. But they were gorgeous and intriguing and got my artistic and creative gears moving. That atop of the fact that Del Toro, my favorite director was heading the film and had cast several actors I adore got my rear in a seat. First off, this is not a horror movie. It's a Gothic Romance. Actually, I'd call it a love letter to the genre. It doesn't necessarily do anything new -- if your familiar with the genre you'll likely guess much of the plot. I did, but I loved it nevertheless. I actually really enjoyed the characters, and as I said this is a gorgeous movie in a macabre sort of way. Be prepared for blood, the disturbing visage of a ghost or three, and all the turn of the century late Victorian era things that come with.

7721310,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"Gothic ghost story, which is my favorite kinda scary movie.  Although I enjoyed this movie, it's just not scary or creepy enough for me.  It has all the elements to be scary, but the ghosts didn't feel real.  It was difficult to distinguish their faces and they just felt like moving skeletons, kinda harmless.  They didn't feel like they were real ""former"" people (I don't know if that makes sense).

The house also didn't do it for me.  It was dilapidated and old with amazing architecture touches, but it just seemed interesting and I would want to explore it, rather than be scared of it.

Jessica Chastain's and Tom Hiddleston's performances, however, are outstanding.  They are by far the most interesting things about this movie.  I wanted to see more of their story, flashbacks to show more of how they became who they are.  It's because of their performances that make me want to watch this movie again.

Overall, it's a good, interesting movie.  I would really give  it 3.5 stars.  Didn't love it but it definitely has it's merits.",1454198400,2,1041,4.711111111111111

7721320,1,B01DOQAKUQ,"Guillermo del Toro seems to have lost his touch - it's hard to believe this muddled, slow and unbelievable ghost flick came from the director behind Pan's Labyrinth. Although the movie starts out strong for the first 30 minutes or so and boasts some beautiful production design throughout, the plot train leaves the tracks after the death of the heroine's father and subsequent move to England.

First, there isn't very much ghostly action in this supposed ghost film. Overly-CG'd spirits appear only to provide essential plot information at relevant points, while the living characters bumble through their lines and struggle to provide any credibility to their 2-dimensional motivations. Mia's character initially begins as the 'strong female author' type and very quickly becomes pathetically dependent on the psychotic brother-sister pair and completely forgets about finishing her novel. By the time the movie gets half way through, it's disposed of the most interesting characters and storylines and it limps through the next hour as a bizarre love triangle interspersed with exposition.

Jessica Chastain is stand-out dreadful here, taking her cues from the Disney evil witch handbook and her English accent from Drusilla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer - she has no ability to emote whatsoever. There is a good film here somewhere struggling to get out, but since it's neither a scary horror nor an engaging love story, all the audience is offered are interesting-looking sets and the promise that it's relatively short. The ending is telegraphed from the beginning of the film so unless you're really not paying attention, there's nothing to look forward to.

7721338,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"Visually, this movie is pure magic. But don't be fooled: it's not a horror movie. It's not even really a 'ghost story.' The key phrase you'll read in the reviews is ""gothic tale"" and that pretty much sums it up. But it is a bit more complex than that.

Without spilling any of the secrets, the bottom line is that it's a very well done movie. The lead actress did a notably good job with her role. The problem here is that it's just not a very interesting story to be told. It's a bit predictable, a bit cliche in terms of how it unfolds. And it's not completely unlike The Devil's Backbone (another one of Del Torro's films).

With Del Torro, you can always count on suspense and atmosphere and sometimes those alone will carry a film. Visually, it was one of the best films I saw all year. I feel like this movie didn't really benefit from CGI (which is used sparingly but given how classic of a setting it was, could have been eliminated altogether).

The pace is somewhat slow, particularly in the first 40 minutes. Those will short attention spans may not make it beyond that stretch. For those of you who long for the days of the classic Hammer type film, this is about as close as you'll get to it in this day and age. It's nice to know that these types of movies can still get made, to be quite honest.

In the end, it does fall a little short as far as an interesting narrative. There are no real surprises or shocks. It is not a complex tale and maybe there is some charm in that. But it does drag at times, even for fans who really like this type of story...fortunately the cinematography and settings/lighting/production save the day.

Even the sound adds to the overall atmosphere the film manages to weave. And again, it's worth a view for those aspects alone. I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5, being as honest as possible. It's not a movie that you'll watch over and over but it's also a movie that no fan of gothic tales should miss.

Another amazing effort by Del Torro who seems to know how to inject just the right balance of magic and beauty into a movie. Ultimately, what kept this from being a 5-star movie was the storyline itself. Editing, direction, cinematography, sound, scenery...as far as those aspects are concerned, this was one of the best films of 2015.

The downside is that, at times, without a strong plot or story, it feels like you're watching it solely for the visuals and those can only carry a movie so far.",1453593600,,2450,4.371428571428571

7721340,1,B01DOQAKUQ,"I had high hopes for this movie, and ended up horribly let down.

While the visuals and costumes were gorgeous and the actors did the best they could with what they had, the script was terrible. There was no real romance, no mystery, and pretty much the entire plot was given away in the first twenty-five minutes of the movie. I knew the Sharpes motives the moment they appeared onscreen together. The ""ghosts"" were laughable--far from the creepy/gothic feel that many have done so well.

This is definitely not a horror movie (as del Toro has said), but THAT is how they promoted it: as a horror movie. It's barely a gothic romance--I never once felt that Thomas cared at all for Edith. Dr. Alan, yes. It was clear his feelings were genuine, and that came through clearly, but not with Thomas. As for Lucille, her motives were so obvious from the beginning, Edith should have seen right through her and Thomas from day one. Given that Edith is supposed to be educated and smart, someone with a lot of spirit, she is FAR from written that way after Thomas comes into play.

I quite honestly was so bored during this movie I contemplated leaving the theatre around the halfway mark, but since I'd spent near $10 of my hard earned money, I sat it out, trying desperately not to fall asleep. Those around had the same issue, and some behind me or across the aisle even began to snore.

7721343,3,B01DOQAKUQ,I really want to like this movie much more than ultimately did. Given a longer running time I think many of the problems would have evaporated. Why is it today Hollywood cannot seem to get it right they can make beautiful films but but falter when it comes to emotional engagement. The house should've been the main character but we didn't get enough of anything to make the tension work. I thought the acting was good at the dialogue was somewhat stilted. I'm sure this was a better experience in the cinema however. Mia Wasikow is a wonderful actress but her character seemed very one-dimensional and derivative of her past performances. Very short story feels like it needed more breath to bring it to life from the pages of the screenplay. Such a wasted opportunity and I don't know who's to blame. The house should have felt isolated like the research station in John carpenters The Thing but ultimately felt inorganic. Maybe I am mistaken and it was supposed to feel lifeless and dead but if that's the case then I wasn't given the impression that was what I was supposed to anticipate. Give it a watch.

The plot is dynamic and smart. The growing tension can be felt minute by minute, once you get into this old mansion. The characters are powerfully depicted and better performed. The eye-camera conveying us to this set of fatidic events that will switch the tragical events that conform the intense drama.

A real feast for your senses. One of the best artistic projects of this year which about to end in just a few hours. Don't leave it aside.

7721346,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"As others have pointed out, this film was mis-marketed as a horror-ghost film, while it is more a psychological nightmare in which the living are the real monsters.  Some audience members complain that the plot is too thin or predictable.  But, in that case, they're not letting the film do what it does best: showing a slow-motion tragedy, like an awful dream.  Del Toro has built a dense mood into this film, including the house, the machines and costumes, the irreal treatment of color, and the beautifully-controlled but sometimes dizzying camera movements.

One key to the film seems to be that you end up feeling strangely sorry for the very worst character.  Jessica Chastain plays Lucille Sharpe with masterful slow-burn control.  During the same period of time that we find out how evil Lucille is, we also find out how sad and damaged she is.  It reminded me a bit of how Fellini makes us feel sorry for the terrible Zampano by the end of La Strada.",1449878400,2,959,4.706586826347305
7721347,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"I hesitated for quite some time about seeing Crimson Peak.  With dreamy Tom Hiddleston dressed in period clothing, I felt drawn to this Gothic movie that had so much secrecy from pre-screening attendees about the plot. Frankly, I don't like to see horror movies because of the lingering images it leaves in my brain.  On the other hand, I am a sucker for period drama of any kind.  So I gave in to the darker side and went to the show after work.

Beforehand, I had read quite a few reviews that contained no spoilers, stating how visually stunning the movie was on the big screen.  I will admit that the costumes and visuals were well done.  As far as the acting, it was top notch from Mia, Jessica, and Tom.  As far as the almost Christian Grey, Charlie Hunnam, he was merely a stick figure insert into a plot that needed him.  His character held no substance except to fill a space.  Thankfully, he dropped out of Fifty Shades because he would have never fit those shoes.

The movie begins in Buffalo, New York rather than England.  Enter Thomas and Lucille Sharpe, who are brothers and sisters.  Thomas has come to the states to raise capital for his mechanical invention to help mine red clay upon his land. He makes a pitch to investors, including Edith's father, Mr. Cushing, but is turned down.

However, the Sharpe's are not those kind of people who take no for an answer.  Thomas turns his attention toward Cushing's daughter and begins to woo her into falling in love with him.  It's easily done by his dashing appearance, smooth English accent, dreamy eyes, enticingly kind voice, and the tenderness of his approach.  Even I would have been suckered into that love affair regardless of the red flags of caution waving all around me and the former ghostly warning to ""beware of Crimson Peak.""

After Edith's father dies a tragic death, she marries Sharpe and is taken back to England and the creepy home that breaths and is sinking into the red clay mucky ground.  Of course, here is where one must zipper their lips in reviews and not give away spoilers as to what is revealed in the story line.  As much as I would like to tell you, I won't spoil it.  However, I will say that on the scare factor that I was so terrified to experience in this movie, I felt very little of it even through the ghostly special effects.  The movie is more of a Gothic tragic romance, if anything, with a bit of lunacy thrown in for stressful and suspenseful watching on the big screen.

Originally, Benedict Cumberbatch was cast as Thomas Sharpe and had to drop out of the role.  I'm glad that he did.  After seeing Hiddleston's masterful performance, I don't believe Benedict would have done great justice to the romancing between Thomas and Edith (as much as I like him in other things).  Jessica Chastain is as loony in the role as Rosamund Pike was in Gone Girl.  Mia does well in period pieces.  She did much better in Crimson Peak than her recent Madame Bovary, which I thought flat.

There are a few buggy things in the movie that prey on your realistic senses and don't sit well.  One is the fact that leaves are always falling through a hole in the roof of the house when there isn't a tree around for miles.  One individual lives through the violence of multiple stabbings that would surely have killed them in real life just from the blood loss.  A scary ghost warns and comforts her child after death.  Not exactly a visit from a loving mother, which I found strangely odd and out of place.

Is Crimson Peak worth the watch?  Yes, there is graphic violence, but you can close your eyes.  If you like period romances and don't mind the color red, it's a must-see.  You may not like the ugliness of ghosts wandering about, but the visuals and underlying story are a tragic tug upon your psyche.",1449705600,2,3797,4.5
7721348,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"The month of October is the most lucrative time for the horror genre, so you often see more than a few showing at once. Crimson Peak, however, is NOT a horror movie, according to its director, Guillermo Del Toro that is. Instead, Del Toro would like it to be categorized as a Gothic Romance. Im sure if youve seen the trailer you would beg to differ, but I side with Del Toro here. The film is breathtakingly beautiful, story driven, deliberate, and well acted- not exactly the usual ingredients of a horror movie.

Mia Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing, a young, ambitious author in a time when it was expected that women celebrate their husbands careers instead of their own.

Edith makes it very clear that shes more interested in the ghost story that shes writing than with finding a man. This, for some reason, changes almost immediately upon meeting Sir Thomas Sharpe, a once wealthy engineer from England. The first 30-45 minutes of the film is supposedly dedicated to making the audience believe that she did in fact fall madly in love with Thomas. All I was convinced of, though, is that she loved her father and he believed in her dreams. Wasikowska came off as more impressed with Thomass worldliness than head-over-heels in love, which would make sense had they stuck to her earlier narrative. But because they attempted to go with the blinded by love rationale, all of her decisions from that point forward seem inauthentic.

Before Thomas whisks Edith away to his creepy mansion in the desolate English countryside (Allerdale Hall), he introduces her to his frighteningly even-toned sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain), who also happens to be a talented pianist. This comes in handy later when creating the unsettling ambiance of the haunted mansion.

Yes, there are ghosts in this film. Ghosts that have been beautifully crafted by advanced special effects. Seeing this movie in the theater alone, was probably not the wisest idea. The trip back to my car through the dark parking lot was certainly a tense experience.

Although the ghosts are visually terrifying, they have no malice in their intentions. The only beings that mean to inflict bodily harm at Allerdale Hall are human beings. Dun dun dun dun!

The mystery is fairly easy to solve, but that dosent mean that those theories aren't horrifying when physically manifested.

Although I assume that Del Toro meant for his gothic romance to be between Edith and Thomas, the far more compelling love story was Thomas and Lucilles (no matter how twisted it was).

Jessica Chastain (as per usual) stole the show. In fact, Id like to see her name on the Oscar ballot for supporting actress. Her Lucille was passionately monstrous, with enough restrain to make her measured dialogue as unsettling as her gruesome actions.

Crimson Peak definitely has its jump out of your seat scares, but its the tormented psychological motivations of the Sharpe siblings that leave your skin crawling.",1448755200,,3207,5.024482109227872

7721351,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"Recent converts to the skills of fan-favorite director Guillermo Del Toro may swoon at the blockbuster spectacle of a film like Pacific Rim which taps into every corner of the geek brain, but others know a good scare is what tickles his fancy. Del Toro's fascination with the Gothic stretches back a ways, and he embraces that adoration fully with the lavish, ostentatious horror Crimson Peak, a film of such bloody good fun it could bring the rarely-used genre back to life.

More of a decadent haunted house story than a ghost story, Crimson Peak is a melodramatic, Victorian wonder teasing dangerous romances, hidden secrets, and of course, murder. While these elements are always tantalizingly on the surface, Del Toro transfixes us with rich, baroque images. He's spared no expense in making this his most beautiful film from top to bottom; from the gorgeous cast to the titular bleeding red mansion that serves as the story's most unforgettable character.

Mia Wasikowska, who has never met a gothic heroine role she didn't like (she was amazing in Cary Fukunaga's Jane Eyre), plays Edith Cushing, an aspiring novelist who we see as a child encountering the ghostly presence of her deceased mother. The apparition's warming to ""Beware Crimson Peak"" lingers on her mind into adulthood, when she remains under the watchful eye of her wealthy industrialist father (Jim Beaver). But neither he nor Edith's stalwart admirer Alan (Charlie Hunnam) are a match for the chivalrous and enigmatic baronet, Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who quickly sweeps her off her feet. A violent, gruesome murder drives Edith further into Sharpe's arms, and soon they are married and flying off to his ancestral home. That she knows practically nothing about Thomas is, of course, obvious to us, but Edith knows even less about his icy, possessive sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) who lords over the mansion like a mad sentinel.

The house is the film's glorious centerpiece, a ruined, disheveled Hogwarts with falling leaves from the rotted roof and red sludge oozing through the floorboards like blood from a gaping wound. As Edith explores her creaky new domicile we too are introduced to its every terrifying nook, captured in exacting detail from the fluttering array of moths to the crimson ectoplasmic ghosts that stalk its halls. It wouldn't be a surprise if Del Toro and co-writer Matthew Robbins were paying homage to the classic Hammer horrors of years past, and the film certainly captures that grotesquely over-the-top spirit that borders on camp.

Del Toro isn't looking to reinvent the wheel here; there's no attempt to hide any of the dangers that threaten poor Edith, but that's what is so enjoyable about it. It allows a certain level of freedom for the immensely talented cast, especially Chastain who projects scorn and disapproval like no other. Wasikowska and Hiddleston are both somewhat restrained, and their characters' romance is never given enough time to fully develop before the evil shenanigans begin. She largely plays to her well-practiced strengths, capturing Edith's innocence and fierce resolve, while Hiddleston is an indecisive rogue with a heart of tarnished gold.

Crimson Peak is, in a way, like the culmination of everything Del Toro has done before, embracing his blockbuster tendencies with the frightful horrors he loved growing up. While there aren't a ton of scares, Del Toro knows how to send a good chill up the spine. His creepier films have always been far and away better than his action-heavy efforts, and hopefully Crimson Peak will inspire Del Toro to tap into this side more often.",1448323200,2,3625,5.095959595959596
7721352,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"The ultimate masterpiece from Guillermo del Toro after Pan's Labyrinth! Beautiful, breathtaking sets and costumes, wonderful and tragic love story with touches of creepy ghosts in it. Great acting from the cast, especially Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston as the Sharpe siblings (Lady Lucille Sharpe and Sir Thomas Sharpe) who lived in their mansion, the Allerdale Hall, in Cumberland, England.

7721353,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"""Crimson Peak"" follows the archetypal story of the traditional Gothic romance, but throws in several creepy twists. I'm not a huge fan of the leading actress, but I adore del Toro's work and knew I had to see the film if only for the cinematics. I ended up going back to see it again (I couldn't even wait for discount night!).

The film's first act is a bit slow, but acts two and three are remarkable. You feel the protagonist's anxiety acutely and find yourself drawn in by the mystery of ""ES"". The character of Lucille is chilling and has a bizarre aura that fascinates you through the entire movie. She was, to me, more interesting than the ghosts. Speaking of the ghosts, they are unlike any monster you have ever seen. They have sinew, color, personality, and are everything one would expect from a del Toro creature. The score, done by Fernando Velasquez, is beyond amazing. The scope of his music is stunning; one moment you're hearing the most innocent piano song and the next you're assaulted with a monstrous tune, but they've been seamlessly blended together. The sets and cinematography are also praiseworthy.

This won't be your cup of tea if you like slasher-type horror films (though there is some gore). You won't enjoy it if you like sweet romances. If you are looking for something dark that has a few jump scares, and want something refreshingly different, ""Crimson Peak"" is a must-see.",1447977600,,1407,4.738775510204082
7721354,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"First- This movie may have bombed but it is going to be a cult classic. Mark my words on this. It reaches and very specific audience that will be wild about it for some time to come.

The only thing keeping this movie from a 5 in my book is the language. It just doesn't always flow. IDK if this is because three of the actors are speaking in accents other than their own or the script or what. Mia W is just a little weak for whole the middle of the film. She lacked passion.

The visuals are amazing and the myriad symbolisms and foreshadowing are pretty awesome.

What I would like to know is how much ended up on the cutting room floor- so to speak. It felt as if a lot of character development, among other things, while complete, were not fleshed out. I would love to see what wasn't used, if indeed there are scene that were cut.

Seriously- For the twit who said the film was getting fake reviews- I assure you I am real. Gothic Romance is a heavily trope laden genre. Sorry you were expecting a splatterfest.",1447718400,46,1017,4.22680412371134

Watching this movie was more like reading a book, it was just enough to keep you interested, but not so much that it overwhelmed the senses.
It really is not a horror movie, it is a twisted story about love, revenge, & redemption.
My biggest motivation, while I love the entire cast, was Tom Hiddleston. He is extremely remarkable in every role he plays.

They leave for England and his falling apart manor, which is called...wait for it....Crimson Peak!

Chastain did a wicked job as Lucille, and wicked in a good way. Hiddleston was underwhelming and the weak link in the film. It is billed as a Gothic Romantic Horror. I thought the romance was forced and not well constructed. I imagine if you have an old run down place, it qualifies as ""Gothic."" The horror felt forced also. The cinematography and costume was done well, in spite of the fact of opening the film in Buffalo.

7721357,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"If you're expecting the typical ghost story--something in the tradition of The Haunting--this ain't it. When I first saw this film, that's exactly what I thought it was, but it turned out to be much more interesting than the average ghost yarn. In this slow-burning film, the ghosts are the horrifying voice of warning to the young protagonist, Edith Cushing. It begins with the warning that her mother's ghost eerily delivers to her: beware Crimson Peak. Years later, as an adult, she meets and is swept off her feet by a dashing, but down-on-his-luck aristocrat who has a very unusual sister. Charmed to the core she marries him and moves with him and his sister to England to what remains of the once-glorious family manor, nicknamed Crimson Peak. Edith's honeymoon thus consists of ghastly hauntings, and chilling confrontations with her sister-in-law. As the plot thickens, Edith slowly begins to discover the dark and twisted secrets that her new husband and sister-in-law share. With every apparition and revelation, Edith starts to realize that the living can be far more terrifying and dangerous than the dead.

This is a fun and interesting film with great effects and excellent performances, especially the brilliant performance of Tom Hiddleston in his role of Thomas Sharpe. It keeps you questioning and trying to guess at the nature of Thomas' and Lucille's relationship and how the premonition Edith received as a child ties in with the secrets they share.",1447027200,,1471,5.078512396694215
7721358,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"If you go into this expecting simple ghost story, you will find that the trailer was a lie. This is one of my favorite horror movies, it's entrancing and intense, has stunning visuals, the most creative ghosts I've seen, and perfectly combines ghost story with psychological thriller and Victorian romance. Mia Wasikowska's character, Edith, describes the novel she wrote as ""Not so much a ghost story, but a story with ghosts in it."" And that perfectly describes Crimson Peak.

Some people complained about Edith not having much of a character arc, but honestly she didn't need one, she was a good, strong female character who fell into an awful situation and did her best with it.

Tom Hiddleston was wonderful as always as Thomas Sharpe, a kind, romantic man passionate about restarting the clay mines on the family estate, but he has a more sinister secret, which adds a layer of creepy to his character that is fantastic. A sense of darkness hovers around him and his sister Lucille, and you've never quite sure what's going to come of it.

Jessica Chastain really stole she show as Lucille Sharpe though, she was so incredibly disturbing and progressively more horrifying as the movie went on. She was absolutely chilling and deserves an award for her level of crazy.

Charlie Hunnam was very enjoyable as well, with his sweet and focused character who would stop at nothing to keep Edith safe.

People were probably disturbed by one of the final plot twists, you'll know what I mean when you see, but I found it creepily refreshing. I suppose the script could have used a few tweaks, but overall Crimson Peak is a fantastic horror movie, certainly better then your run of the mill horror about stupid people making dumb choices.",1446940800,,1735,4.808724832214765
7721359,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Like every genre, gothic stories have their tropes -- ghosts, eerie moors, girls in fluttering white nightgowns, handsome brooding men, spooky old mansions, sexual perversions and old secrets hidden from sight.

And Guillermo del Toro loves them. Every single one. Every trope. Otherwise, ""Crimson Peak"" wouldn't be the love letter to gothic fiction that it is -- a sensual, ripe, rich-looking movie that mingles gothic romance with a sense of creeping horror... and, you know, a few howling ghosts. With a dream cast of Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowski, del Toro sculpts a beautifully grotesque piece of art that drapes its skeletons in black lace and silk.

As a child, Edith Cushing (Wasikowska) was visited by the ghost of her mother, who warned her ""Beware of Crimson Peak."" Vague, but chilling. Fourteen years later, Edith is an aspiring author who wants to write stories about ghosts instead of girly romances, which brings her in contact with the impoverished baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston) and his weird, icy sister Lucille (Chastain). Sharpe is hoping that Edith's father will invest in a clay-mining invention that he's developing, but Mr. Cushing (Jim Beaver) is not impressed.

He's even less impressed when he finds that Edith is falling in love with Thomas, due to his elegance and advice on her writing. He tries to bribe the siblings into leaving Boston for good. Then he's murdered by a mysterious figure, although the authorities believe that it was an accident.

A grieving Edith quickly marries Sir Thomas, and he whisks her away to his remote ancestral estate in England, a vast, rotting mansion that is slowly sinking into the red clay mine underneath it. As Edith explores her new home, she finds that this mansion has some literal ghosts -- terrifying red-soaked specters that seem to be trying to warn her. As she slowly unearths the horrors of Allerdale Hall, she begins to realize the terrible secrets that her new husband is keeping from her... and the terrible fate that awaits her.

In a way, ""Crimson Peak"" is a sequel to del Toro's previous movie ""The Devil's Backbone"" -- most of the horror comes from very human evils, with the ghosts not being scary or threatening. But this one is pure gothic romance, and not just because he happily name-drops Jane Austen and Mary Shelley. Every image and concept associated with gothic ""blood and thunder tales"" can be found here. Dashing, brooding man with a secret? Check. Girl running around in a trailing white gown? Check. Big scary house with spooky places you're not supposed to go? Coughing up blood? Strange deaths? Check. Check. CHECK!

In fact, this movie practically drips with luscious, beautifully-decayed gothic atmosphere -- the dead leaves and snow fluttering through the gaping hole in Allerdale's main hall, the damp rooms filled with creepy toys and flickering shadows, the black moths fluttering around the heroine as she floats through the ornately-spiky halls. It's a visual feast, but an unsettling one.

The entire plot is a slow-building mass of suspense that explodes into bloody, fluttering violence at the end, but del Toro does pause to develop the characters in a very organic way (Edith's tearful ramble about her father's clothing choices after identifying his body). And while some of the dialogue can be cliched (""You're so... different."" ""From who?"" ""Everyone""), del Toro manages a Victorian style of speech that seems natural and fluid (""I advise you to return to your ghosts and fancies, the sooner the better. You know precious little about the human heart or love or the pain that comes with it!"").

The biggest problem with the story? Well... I saw the big twist coming from the beginning of the movie. It's really very obvious, and at times you just want Edith to catch up to what is obviously going on. But hey, she's a sheltered naive young girl in the late Victorian period, so perhaps she can be forgiven for not cluing in.

And in that regard, Wasikowski does pretty well. Her acting seems a bit tremulous, but she does convincingly depict a naive, sheltered young woman who thinks she's more worldly-wise than she is, only to discover that the world is crueler than she ever dreamed. And Hiddleston is absolutely perfect as Sir Thomas -- he's elegant and charming, making use of the actor's natural charisma and wide-eyed intensity. Yet he's also a weak-willed man who has done terrible things, and Hiddleston manages to make you both despise and like him by the movie's end.

On the flipside, Chastain gives a downright eerie performance as Lucille, a lady who seems to have only two settings: homicidal rage and icy remoteness. At times she seems a bit over-the-top, but her slow unraveling is genuinely scary. Charlie Hunnam and Jim Beaver also give good, robust performances as Edith's earnest admirer and her genial dad.

""Crimson Peak"" is an exquisite little monster -- it's Guillermo del Toro dabbling in classic gothic romance, spinning his own story as he pays homage to others. Great performances, eerie atmosphere and a rotting haunted mansion.... what's not to love?",1446768000,5,5126,4.990632318501171
7721360,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"I should begin this review with a disclaimer: I am underwhelmed by Del Toro and this movie was my date's pick, not mine. His poetic imagery in film often approaches greatness but falters because of this glossy fantasy element he chooses to employ that I can only call sentimental. It can be corny.  That said, I enjoyed this movie and found it much better than Kronos.

In turn of the century New York, a young girl named Edith (Sofia Wells), the seven-year-old daughter of Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), a wealthy Buffalo businessman, is visited by the ghost of her recently deceased mother. The ghastly apparition whispers the warning ""Beware of Crimson Peak."" The deeply frightened girl has no idea what the warning means and the ghost does not return.

However, after the violent death of her father, she decides to do exactly that. Move to Crimson Peak, a foreboding manor with the non industrious Thomas Sharpe (played by Tom Hiddleston in an icy, distant, disturbed and believable performance).  And here comes the kicker: Jessica Chastain as Lucille Sharpe, the secret of the family, and for good reason. I loved her performance and was so drawn to her that even with some displeasing revelations to say the very least wanted her to be better off at the end than she was.

This is all a metaphor for family, stagnation, and the lies we will tell and live in just to keep things calm.  What I liked was Del Toro pushing the darkness to the extreme, something he rarely does in his other films. Just a few degrees to the left or right and this movie would have been a Poe-esque classic. Still, missing this would be missing a rare, rare film experience. Absolutely recommended.",1446681600,,1681,4.720136518771331
7721361,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"I want to like this movie more than I actually do. I like del Toro. Mostly. Although he may be shifting to a focus that too much relies on visuals over story for me. Or, maybe, he's always been that way but just happened to have better stories for the movies I liked. At any rate, Crimson Peak is visually amazing. But, then, Pacific Rim was visually amazing; dumber than a box of rocks but visually amazing, nonetheless.

Of course, the thing that stands out most is the ghosts. Or, maybe, the house. The house is pretty amazing. But the ghosts are freaky and cool. And, well, there are issues with the house that take away from its ""cool"" factor.

So, yeah, ghosts... Because it's a Gothic thing, and you have to have something supernatural in Gothic things, right? Evidently. Except for Wuthering Heights. That one gets by on tragedy alone.

I really wanted to do this without spoilers, but I'm finding myself unable to, because I'm going to just go ahead and say this, so... SPOILER ALERT!

The problem with the ghosts is that they are just a sleight-of-hand, which, in-and-of-itself is fine, I like sleight of hand, but the movie pretends to be a ghost story, and it's not that. It's a story with some ghosts in it. There's a huge difference between those two things. These ghosts are no more than props. To say this is a ghost story would be like trying to say that something is a chair story just because there happened to be some chairs in it.

But they do look cool. The ghosts, not the chairs.

Then there's the house, which also looks cool, but there are so many problems with the house that it drags the movie down into stupidity much like the house is sinking into the clay on top of the peak. Because, you know, the clay is so soft that it can't support the weight of the house but
1. we're expected to believe that someone built a house on clay that soft to begin with.
2. we're expected to believe that a mountain made of oozing clay would even exist.
I could go on with issues around the house (like the huge hole in the roof that exists only so that leaves can aesthetically flutter down around the characters (while they are inside) throughout the movie), but let's just stop there and say that the house broke my suspension of disbelief.

Beyond that stuff, the story is pretty formulaic... in a Flowers in the Attic sort of way. The ghost stuff is just there so that you won't see what's actually going on. You expect a supernatural story. Like I said: sleight of hand.

The acting is decent. That's about all that can be said about, though Tom Hiddleston is quite charming, which is good, because that's exactly what he's supposed to be. Jim Beaver is also good as Edith's father, but, really, it's the same sort of role he always plays, so you can't say he was any better than usual. Jessica Chastain was also pretty much as she always is, cold and somewhat aloof. I'm not sure at this point if she's capable of anything other than that. And Wasikowska... well... she's not bad. But she's also not good. She just kind of is. I find her mostly bland.

So, yeah, I want to like this movie. The use of the ghosts is almost very clever, and, again, cool. But the places where logic and sense are sacrificed to what looks cool are just too plentiful. I can't turn my brain off that much. It's not a movie I'll ever willingly watch again because, now that I've seen it, any other viewing will cause me to be irate at all the dumb.",1446595200,20,3447,4.398744113029827

The colors, atmosphere, intense emotions in this story transcend the stereotype of calling this simply either a horror or a gothic romance movie. The performance by Tom Hiddleston is especially good. He managed to bring humanity to a character who if not a monster then is someone who has done monstrous things. The scene between Thomas and Edith in his workshop ... just keep your eyes on Thomas' face, what an actor to be able to express so many emotions with no words, I want to re watch the movie just to see that scene again.

7721366,2,B01DOQAKUQ,"A fan of both gothic romance and a connoisseur of quality horror films, this reviewer was deeply disappointed on both fronts with ""Crimson Peak"". Nakedly derivative of stories like ""Rebecca"", ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Notorious"" (Hitchcock's, that is) but without the literary underpinnings provided by writers like Daphne du Maurier, Charlotte Bronte, and script writers like Ben Hecht, ""Crimson Peak"" never reaches the pinnacles of those superb exemplars of gothic romance, and certainly not the pinnacles of horror offered by, e.g., ""The Haunting"", which of course was taken from Shirley Jackson's terrifying novella. Not quite a ghost movie, not quite a gothic romance, with plotlines that become all too clear within half an hour, and holes in the narrative big enough to be seen, as the fearsome Malcolm Tucker would have put it, from outer space, CP is mostly notable for its gorgeous production values. Except that those production values are part of CP's problem: they are so over the top that you can't understand why the highly intelligent Edith Cushing ever walked in the door of Allerdale Hall after marrying its owner, Thomas Sharpe, Bt., rather than running screaming back to the carriage and demanding to be taken to the nearest train station.

The thing about gothic romance is that the heroine has to be pulled in by something presenting itself as reasonable - but everyone in the theater can tell immediately that the two Sharpe siblings are dangerously ""off"" and the sister is a psycho. Edith Cushing, played by Mia Wasikowska, is characterized as a strong-minded, intelligent American heiress. She's no penniless governess, or orphaned lady's companion, and Thomas Sharpe isn't Mr. Rochester or Maxim de Winter, and Allerdale Hall isn't Manderley or Fairfield. Del Toro, who co-wrote the script, borrowed an entire plot device and closing scenes straight from ""Notorious"", in which a matchless Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains carried it off far better. The much ballyhooed sex scene was shamelessly overhyped: the few seconds of Hiddleston's naked rear end is nothing much these days, when male actors are doing full frontal nudity. Such views are quite routine, and given that Edith is allegedly a virgin, her sudden imperious mounting of Thomas is a tad unrealistic for an inexperienced girl - as is the passivity with which she waits what appear to be weeks on end after her marriage to be deflowered properly, seeming just a bit puzzled instead of afflicted with a dreadful suspicion that something is very, very wrong.

In the theater where I saw it, people giggled at the ghosts. ""Rebecca"" was far more compellingly romantic, and ""The Haunting"", with no CGI ghosts ripping themselves out of the floor, no blood, no gore, and no black garbed corpses floating around the hallways, was 100 times more frightening.

Bottom line, Guillermo del Toro is a lousy writer. He may be great at production and Spanish language films but he can't write, at least not in English. He should have handed the script to someone who could or been tied to a chair and forced to watch ""Rebecca"" twenty times, to see how a truly great script unfolds - e.g., it's not until more than halfway through ""Rebecca"" that you really find out the shocking truth of the relationship between Maxim and the First Mrs. de Winter. In CP, you can see it all within the first 20 minutes, it's all given away like so much candy on Halloween. del Toro took inspiration from these films, but didn't learn any of their narrative lessons.

The cast did its best. Hiddleston is handsome, elegant, and does manage to lend the blighted Thomas some ambivalence and troubled humanity, but what's compelling about him isn't the brief glimpse of his derriere, but his beautiful voice, blue eyes, frayed elegance, and air of deteriorating gentry. Jessica Chastain is the stony-faced aristo version of Mrs. Danvers, and it's a fairly one-note performance. Mia Wasikowska is decently bookish, intelligent, maidenly, and courageous as required at different points in the film. We are never given clarity on why she doesn't warm until too late to the intelligent, sensible, handsome doctor played by Charlie Hunnam who loves her so much. Wasikowska's ridiculous, nearly floor-length hair extensions and the huge sleeves on every garment she owns, including the nightgowns in which she goes out into the halls of Allerdale at night holding candelabra aloft, are scarier than the red ghosts.

It's too bad, given the talent available here, that as much attention wasn't paid to the writing as the CGI ghosts and the overheated details of Allerdale Hall. The film may pick up nominations for production and costumes, but it's no surprise that it flopped so badly at the box office. David O. Selznick, who produced both ""Rebecca"" and ""Gone with the Wind"", would have burnt this script in his wastebasket.

The role of Thomas Sharpe was initially to be played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who pulled out allegedly due to script concerns; the script was then rewritten when Hiddleston got the role. For awhile, as anticipation and excitement built for del Toro's newest venture, it appeared that Mr. Cumberbatch might have made a mistake - but he's likely crooning Connie Francis's ""Who's Sorry Now?"" to himself in the shower.

It's a shame. So many of us wanted to like this film.",1446076800,11,5346,5.020293122886133

This Gothic horror story is no different.  The film opens in Buffalo, N.Y. in the early 1900s.  Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young, aspiring writer seemingly focused on ghosts.  She is the daughter of a wealthy, widowed industrialist (Jim Beaver) who made his money the hard way and not by inheritance.  Mr. Cushing is most interested in hooking Edith up with a handsome Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) who is a long standing childhood friend.  McMichael is certainly interested in courtship but Edith isn't ready for marriage.

Cushing is approached by a pair of British siblings of Nobel blood.  Lucille Sharp (Jessica Chastain) and her slightly younger brother, Thomas (Tom Hiddleston) are looking for financial investors.  Thomas has invented a machine built for digging deep into the earth, specifically for the blood-red clay his family home is built upon.  Suspecting something is amiss, Cushing hires an investigator to check on the Sharps.  As he suspects, he finds they are near bankruptcy and that they have been rebuffed all over the world.

We wouldnt have a movie of course if that was all there was to it.  As it turns out young Miss Cushing has fallen hard for Thomas and apparently he for her.  As the only potential beneficiary of the family wealth, the internal gears begin to turn.  And wouldnt you know it, (spoiler) Mr. Cushing is murdered.  With a quick time elapse, we see Thomas and Edith now recently married returning to the English manse, which is in extremely run down condition.  Lucille is cold as ice, both in her treatment of her new sister-in-law and with her brother.

What classifies the movie as a horror story is that Edith has been seeing ghosts, even before going to England.  The wispy images of her mother seem to warn her of crimson peak which she doesnt understand until she discovers that is what the red clay is called.  The English mansion set is reportedly built from scratch by del Toro and his production crew.  And it looks fabulously creepy.  In some ways reminiscent of Draculas castle from the 1931 film with a little help from Kubricks The Shining.  I cant say the movie is particularly scary, but like del Toros other films, I don't think it is meant to be.  Sure the film has its moments, but the usually cool Edith keeps the rest of us concerned but not jumping out of our seats.  Predictable?  Sure.  With theaters now filled with a plethora of slasher, gory, blood splattered visuals, its nice to see more robust surroundings given to a thoughtful, if far from perfect, script.",1445644800,2,2701,4.785714285714286
7721372,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"Directed by Guillermo del Toro (Pacific Rim, Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth) from a screenplay by del Toro and Matthew Robbins (Sugarland Express, Mimic), Crimson Peak is a strange mix of a film.  On a purely visual level, it's a sumptuous stylistic masterpiece, dazzling to the eye, compelling in its attention to period/genre detail, certain to get Oscar nominations for Cinematography, Art Direction, and Costume Design. But when it comes to the story, it has a rather heavy-handed feel to it. Everything is telegraphed so that events as they unfold fail to really surprise or even shock except when overt violence is involved. And the characterizations and dialogue tend to be so arch and laid on so thick that the film ultimately leans toward tedious rather than engaging.  Yes, there is a certain atmosphere and style to be maintained for any gothic romance/horror story, but in this case it's so thick and unrelenting that it feels like it was laid on with a shovel.

In turn of the century New York, a young girl named Edith (Sofia Wells), the seven-year-old daughter of Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), a wealthy Buffalo businessman, is visited by the ghost of her recently deceased mother. The ghastly apparition whispers the warning ""Beware of Crimson Peak."" The deeply frightened girl has no idea what the warning means and the ghost does not return.

The experience apparently made a deep impression though, for fourteen years pass and we next see a grown Edith (Mia Wasikowska) as an aspiring young author who writes ghost stories. But the editors she approaches only want to see romance novels, that being what they deem women writers of the day should confine themselves to.  Edith decides to use a typewriter at her father's office to transcribe her manuscript, to avoid having her handwriting giving away that it was written by a woman.  While there, she meets Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleson), an English aristocrat who has come to persuade her father's company to invest in his clay mining invention. Cushing, however, has a dim view of what he considers privileged aristocracy and is unimpressed with the functioning prototype Sharpe shows him.  He is also aware of previous failed efforts on Sharpe's part to raise capital in England, Scotland and Italy.  Cushing brusquely rejects Sir Thomas' appeal and dismisses him.  Edith, however, is intrigued by Sir Thomas and his sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), her writer's eye noting that the pair wear stylish but dated fashions and their shoes, though expensive, show signs of wear, tell-tale signs of aristocracy in decline. Sir Thomas is equally intrigued by Edith, and in spite of her father's rejection and obvious disapproval, begins to take up with her.

In spite of her father's cautions - and a second appearance by her mother's ghost delivering the same cryptic warning - Edith finds herself romantically drawn to the handsome Sir Thomas and his charming manner, much to the chagrin of her father and of Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), a childhood friend who harbors his own feelings for her. In short order, in spite of a determined effort by her father to break things off and send the Sharpes away, Edith marries Sir Thomas and then goes with him when he and Lucille return to their ancestral home in rural England, a magnificent but decaying mansion called Allerdale Hall. But once there, things quickly grow ominous.  To say any more would be to spoil things.

It's difficult to emphasize just how high Crimson Peak sets the bar for visual style. The attention to detail, the choice of coloring, the contrasts of light and dark in the different settings and in the characters' clothing, the use of space in both the interior and exterior shots, the sheer seamlessness of the composition of each frame, giving the film a feeling that it was painted rather than shot.  And then there's Allerdale Hall, which is in many ways the real star of Crimson Peak.  Production designer Thomas E. Sanders (Braveheart, Bram Stoker's Dracula) made the Sharpes' ancestral home a presence in its own right and you feel it in every scene that takes place in or near it - magnificent, brooding, haunted, thick with grandeur and decay, the very ground it stands on seeming to bleed around it.  Filmmakers are going to be studying this for years to come.

As a gothic romance/horror film, Crimson Peak hits just about every defining characteristic on anyone's list.  Magnificent, decaying mansion? Check.  Atmosphere of mystery and suspense? Check.  Secrets buried in the past?  Check.  Ghosts?  Check.  Omens, portents, visions? Check.  Bleak, foreboding landscape? Check.  Virginal heroine isolated and threatened by ominous forces? Check.  High, overwrought emotions? Check.  Woman threatened by impulsive tyrannical figure? Check.  Madness? Check.  Repressed or perverse sexuality? Check.  Quite frankly, short of having Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley or one of the Bront sisters making a personal cameo appearance, it's hard to imagine how Crimson Peak could have been any more gothic than it is.  If you're looking to OD on gothic romance/horror with a decanter of absinthe some evening, this is the film to go with.

But for all of its style, there's something lacking in Crimson Peak, something that keeps the film from completely drawing the viewer in.  It's not the fault of the actors, all of whom give solid performances. I'd have to say that it's the script and the direction that falls short, or rather, is simply too heavy handed.  Everything that happens ends up being telegraphed - in the way the scenes unfold, in the things the camera focuses on, and particularly in the dialogue - so that you anticipate what is to happen long before it actually happens, or what will be discovered long before it's actually discovered. As a result there is a certain detachment to the film - like some annoying person in the row behind you is constantly commenting ""Oh, and this is the scene where _this_ happens"" - that leaves you feeling disengaged the further the film progresses.

Still, I do feel that Crimson Peak is worth seeing if you go in with the right expectations.  Recommended for Guillermo del Toro fans (of which I am one), for its lush visual and highly detailed style, and for people who like their gothic romance/horror laid on _really_ thick.",1445558400,102,6326,4.980038022813688
7721373,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Before you watch you should know this is more a gothic thriller / romance than horror film, not so much a ghost story as a story with ghosts.

Tom Hiddleston and Mia Wasikowska play the main characters very well but also impressive are the only slightly less central characters played by Jessica Chastain and Jim Beaver.

7721376,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"Nine things about the movie ""Crimson Peak""

1. Despite what the advertising may lead you to believe, this is not a ghost story. Its a story with ghosts in it.

2. Director Guillermo del Toro is known for making movies that are usually thin on plot, but make up for it by being so beautiful that you cant stop watching. This is one of those films. At almost any point in the movie, you could pause it, make a print of whats on the screen, and hang it up on your wall. Im not even exaggerating.

3. The movie is about a British aristocrat, Thomas Sharpe, who has invented a machine to dig up the red clay on his property. He comes to America to convince a wealthy businessman to invest in the invention. He falls in love with the daughter of the investor. Stuff happens, and they go to live together in his crumbling English mansion. The mansion isn't as charming as Edith was expecting.

4. The story is simple and melodramatic (the characters are even color-coded so you can tell whos good and whos bad right away). They could have cut 30 minutes out of the story and been fine. But its so beautiful to watch that you really don't care that nothing much is happening.

5. There isn't a lot of supernatural stuff in the movie, nor much violence, either. The ghosts are basically extras  they technically don't even need to be there, except as a visual representation of some of the story themes.

6. However, when something ghastly does happen, its quite effective. There are a couple of scenes with explicit and sudden violence. And the ghosts. This movie has some of the best, most grotesque spirits Ive ever seen in a movie. Its just too bad there aren't more of them.

7. The movie contains a hodge-podge of social commentary and metaphor. It contrasts British and American aristocracy. Its a pretty obvious allegory for the limited and conflicting roles of women in society. And its about how you can be so good at manipulating others that you forget you can be manipulated, too.

8. There is a very dark, bitter heart to the movie. Love, in almost all its forms, is poisonous and tragic and deceitful. Heroes suffer, and you cant escape the sins of your father (or mother).

9. If you are expecting a scary movie, or even a really creepy ghost story, you will be disappointed. Honestly, youll probably be kind of bored. Its barely even a movie. But if you let yourself sink into the gothic, unearthly beauty of this piece of visual art, youll be rewarded with images that will haunt you well after its finished.",1445212800,2,2516,4.50989010989011
7721377,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"Del Toros new film is a gripping, traditional Gothic tale. The crumbling mansion, family secrets, isolation, ghosts, the power of the past, these familiar Gothic tropes are used spectacularly to create a film that is a visual delight and genuinely frightening.

It begins in the real world but, as in many fairy tales and myths, the heroine is lured away from her safe home to a dreadful Otherworld, imprisoned and alone. This is Allerdale Hall, sitting atop the Crimson Peak, where she is plunged into a world of supernatural horror, decadence and decay. Brilliantly filmed, these scenes juxtapose decay and disrepair with spectacular beauty. In the Otherworld of Allerdale Hall Edith is forced to shed her identity of lovestruck ingnue and recreate herself, drawing on strengths she did not know she possessed. Ironically, it is her experience in the Otherworld which enables her to fully realise her humanity. She emerges from her experience a different person.

The film explores are the deceptiveness and  partiality of vision, where nothing is as it seems, including ones own self. The ghosts are satisfyingly scary and are crucial to the film's plot and themes. Both Thomas and Lucille are tragic characters, sinister and mysterious, but vulnerable and conflicted. The film is also a mystery story in the Poe tradition, as Edith resolutely pursues the truth about Allerdale Hall and its inhabitants.

Other intertextual inspirations for the film include Rebecca, The Fall of the House of Usher, and Bluebeard. Del Toro clearly knows his Gothic. Here he draws on such influences to create a smouldering, stunning film, filled with menace, suspenseful and with plenty of plot twists and surprises. Highly recommended.",1445212800,86,1722,5.228260869565218
7721378,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"Del Toro's visuals and the acting of the 3 leads turn a blah story into a interesting movie. Definitely worth the watch, but know this: It is not a horror movie. More like a Gothic Romance/Ghost Story.",1445212800,,201,4.45945945945946
7721379,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"In a time when acting seems to have disappeared from the horror film and sophistication of thought seems to be on its way out of the movie theater (at least here in the West), director Guillermo del Toro reinvents the wheel of the Gothic romance spectacle with the new ""Crimson Peak"", a film intelligent enough to play the fraudulent 19th century conception of ghosts (read Shenstone if you have not yet) by putting the psychology back into the equation and yet also a film not confident enough to dispense with the PAN'S LABYRINTH-style graphic violence that seems to be continually unbalancing its aesthetic nature (it may not be quite as sickening here, but it's every bit as brutal). Just in time for the Halloween season but not quite honestly a horror movie, ""Crimson Peak"" is really the story of a tragic brother/sister relationship and a particular young lady's psychological fears of being taken hostage by the Gothic mansion of the title, lured there, of course, by the promise of sex and a fulfilling romance with a particular gentleman savior. But what must be said is that del Toro's film does not dominantly rely upon the penny dreadful quality of its narrative (perhaps that new television show entitled ""Penny Dreadful"" encouraged the studio's confidence in putting this one out--but the box office take doesn't look promising for the filmmakers unfortunately) so much as it does upon the tranquil cinematography of Dan Laustsen, a shadowy and token visual style that is not so much freaky as it is antique.
""Crimson Peak"" may ultimately end up doing better on DVD and Blu-Ray than it will at the theaters currently; it is my shame in admitting it, but I fell asleep briefly during the love scene and dozed a while thereafter before returning in time to get in on all the violence near the climax (I should have known better than to attend the late night screening). Anyway, I did take in a lot of the film and what I saw was rather beautiful and articulate, and I think that many are criticizing the story elements more so than the visual scheme; there are ghosts and creepy things running around in the movie, but tragically the television ads and theatrical trailer have again sold a rather solid drama movie short by presenting it instead as hardball horror (what is up with film marketing these days?), implying that trailers may have to lie to us in order to plant our asses in the theater to watch a two hour movie. But the women are all photographed beautifully, there is an elegant costume design, performances (especially those of Wasikowska, Chastain, and Hiddleston) are all immaculate, and the style of the film is quite sophisticated even the story is more pulpy than the first edition of a Shadow magazine. On home media, this movie will find a life, right alongside other Halloween/spooky favorites such as Horror of Dracula (1958), Let's Scare Jessica to Death, The Shining (1980), and others. Del Toro comes from a ""Night Gallery""-esque point of view as a thriller writer, and I know where his artistic influences lie (and I approve, by the way), but even though his pictures carry a certain kind of cinematic uniqueness his ambitions often outrun his ability to properly shape the whole thing. Still, I'm recommending the film. Considering how much advertising that went into this, I'm afraid that the box office return is going to be rather sad for such a nifty genre entry as this one (I did catch the interview with the two leads on Good Morning America and enjoyed that brief conversation as well). Tom Hiddleston's face here has some of the fractured hurt and 19th century lift of Daniel Day-Lewis's face in ""The Age of Innocence"" as filmed by Martin Scorsese--my hope is that this film will be sitting right alongside my copy of that Scorsese classic in future so that I can enjoy re-watching the both of these many times. The preview for the upcoming ""Victor Frankenstein"" looked good but also quite cartoonish; with ""Crimson Peak"", del Toro has gone for something both genre influenced and adult, which is actually a weird combination...but certainly not an ignoble one. To see a classy 19th century costume thriller like this one is getting pretty rare these days, so I am offering a positive notice for the picture overall. B+",1445126400,4,4271,4.820163487738419

Why should the ghost of a little girl's mother returning to warn her of some impending danger appear as a snake-like medusa that thrusts herself through doors? I thought Tom Hiddleston's transformation from the talented and good natured Captain Nicholls of Warhorse to the, dark and macabre figure of Thomas Sharpe was amazing and really showed off his broad range of talent. So, overall, the acting was excellent. The set design was very good. But the plot really failed to evoke the horror of the situation.",1445126400,,773,4.908396946564886
7721382,5,B01DOQAKUQ,"While fans of Guillermo Del Toro are patiently waiting for Hellboy 3; even while the Pacific Rim sequel has lost its original 2017 release date, I can't help but be delighted to review his new movie Crimson Peak.

Without spoilers, I should start by saying Crimson Peak is a beautiful film to look at. The visual spectacle and raw detail put into this movie is absolutely special. It's also worth noting that the costume design and effects are made exceptionally well.

If I were to merely say ""there are some really good performances in Crimson Peak"", then I would be understating it. The performances aren't just good-they are FANTASTIC. Tom Hiddleston (perhaps best known to Marvel Cinematic fans as Loki), is absolutely brilliant as Thomas Sharpe. He portrays the character ever so impressively;  and shares convincing chemistry alongside Jessica Chastain's sultry but deceptive character Lucille Sharpe. Jessica Chastain is magnetic each time the camera is focused on her character, and Tom Hiddleston portrays Thomas with such emotion and creative flair that you nearly forget that both he and Chastain are acting. While I did enjoy Mia Wasikowska's outing as Edith for the most part, there were moments  where I felt she could have put more emotion into her character during certain scenes. Charlie Hunnam also rewards the audience with a satisfactory outing as Alan McMichael.

The story in Crimson Peak is part romance part horror. The movie as a whole seems almost poetic at times; especially in terms of dialogue. Rather than focus on demonology or satanism(like so many other horror flicks have), Crimson Peak focuses not only on jump scares and ghosts, but also on the trustworthiness and real intentions of people around Mia Wasikowska's character Edith. This film definitely earned it's R rating, and all in all, Crimson Peak is a pleasing addition to Guillermo del Toro's filmography.

And if I learned anything from this movie it's this: Ghosts are real. Beware your journey to Crimson Peak.........",1445126400,,2016,5.112462006079028

8756549,3,B01DOQAKUQ,"I'd added this film to my Halloween list for October, when I found a review that said the studio had emphasized the horror scenes in the trailer, and in reality the movie was more of a gothic romance than a horror flick.  Don't you just hate that?  ""Blue Jasmine"" seemed so funny in trailers when in fact all the funny bits were IN the trailer and the movie was not only a very moving film of a woman's mental descent, Woody Allen didn't even bother to try to make San Francisco worth looking at---as he had for Paris and Rome.

This is not that kind of movie.  That reviewer must have been texting while watching.  This movie is a remarkably gory gothic romance---people don't just die, they get their heads bashed in and you get to watch.  Otherwise, as horror films go---I loved it, right up my alley.  I can't stand the slasher flicks and I don't like films that will linger on and give me the creeps on those lonely nights in a dark creaky apartment (like ""Angel Heart"").  This one is a haunted house/ghost film---with ghosts that are more monster corpses than spectres (think ""Pirates of The Caribbean"").  Oh, and there isn't a lot of the romance part either---but it's very gothic.

So, if you're looking for a creepy film with a fantastically atmospheric haunted house, bits of extremely violent gore, and recurrent grotesques as ghostly figures; one that is lavishly filmed (in 70mm no less) for your October viewing, add this to your list, right near ""The Orphanage"".",1535846400,,1477,4.624521072796935

8756554,4,B01DOQAKUQ,"I'm not much of a horror fan, at least not visceral horror (give me Hitchcock any day, though), so I was glad to find out that some of the advertising for this movie was entirely off base: as other reviewers have said, this is a classic Gothic romance - tragic, beautiful and haunting, exquisitely detailed, with aspects of (perhaps inevitable) madness, twisted history, and dark secrets that linger long after they should have been released from the world. The trivia says that Hiddleston found the script quite frightening, and I'm sure he did - all the elements are there, and honestly I'd love to read the script, because I suspect it would satisfy me in a way this film just didn't.

This isn't Pan's Labyrinth, which is one of my favorite films of all time, though I can only watch it at certain times or it does very odd things to my mood. But that's part of why I love it - it affects me every time. Crimson Peak has all the right elements, but it just doesn't quite come together. I have to wonder if that's partly the trouble of translating a Gothic tale, which hinges so much on evocative language, into a screen story. But on the other hand, we HAVE Pan's Labyrinth. So I had high hopes for this film.

The sets and costuming are fabulous, as is the cinematography, often if not always. Some of the shots are honestly breathtaking, simply heartbreaking (SPOILER: like the final shot of Thomas), or can't-but-must-look-away horrible (the ants and the dying butterfly). Del Toro's deft touch is everywhere in the house on the hill. The earlier part of the story is well done, but not as evocative - it honestly lacks the palpability of the Sharpe mansion. It's possible that was del Toro's intent - often the Gothic parts of Gothic horror seem more weighted with reality, more full-limbed, even in their fellness, than the bright dance of polite society. Still, it makes it harder to get fully invested in the story.

It's definitely worth a watch, and our heroine does have a Mina Harker (Dracula) feel, despite the swept-away, apparent brain flatline that lands her at Crimson Peak in the first place, but you have to keep in mind the times in which these stories were written and how sheltered even bright, capable women were, when still young, never mind how first love tends to inspire acts that normally would be considered beyond foolish. I'm sorry we don't see more of the budding romance - it seems to largely flower in a scene we don't even see, when Thomas convinces Edith to come to the dance. How? One minute she's our sensible writer, and the next she's trying to make nice with the horrible hostess. It doesn't ring true. Maybe it was a cut scene? It wouldn't have had to be long, not with the actors and director involved. But it's just not there.

It's still a beautiful movie. But the writing is not as good as it could be, the characters are frankly not as horrifying and/or conflicted as they should be, and the most Gothic part of the tale is the lingering visual suggestion at the very end, that Sharpe Manor will continue to sink, slowly, inevitably, into the earth, uncleansed, until even its ghosts are entombed in the wet red clay that is swallowing it by inches. Nothing and no one will get free of it, not sinners, not saints.

May give it another shot at point, but probably won't buy it unless I actually study it for the visuals. I buy movies whose stories wrap me up in them; I'll forgive poor cinematography for a good solid story. This one tries, it really does, but it's not going to give me any bad dreams, which I was frankly hoping it would.",1534636800,,3589,4.54953560371517
