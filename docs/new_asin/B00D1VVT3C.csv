5767138,5,B00D1VVT3C,"I watched the first season before deciding to give up television. I thought it was ok, but not a show I would put on my list to purchase when the next season came out on DVD.  The price convinced me to buy the 4 season package and I'm very glad I did. This program has progressed to be a great series and one I will purchase each year. Thank you Amazon for your wonderful Monday specials",1389052800,,387,4.092105263157895
5767139,5,B00D1VVT3C,"Came as scheduled, everything looked and plays well as i expect it to. Thank you, that is all i've got",1388793600,2,102,4.15
5767140,5,B00D1VVT3C,This product is awesome. Got it for my son as a Christmas gift but our whole family loves this show and would highly recommend it as a family show.  It came way before it was due and was in excellent shape. If ya love crime shows this is a must!!,1388620800,3,246,3.92
5767141,5,B00D1VVT3C,"This show is awesome!  I prefer it to the original NCIS - which is a very good show!  It has an interesting group of main characters and ongoing plot line mixed in with some action with the investigative ""cop show"" drama.  The show uses more of the updated technology as part of the plot line over the regular NCIS.  It is one of the few series that I continue to record and watch on a weekly basis - and would actually purchase the seasons on DVD/blu-ray.",1387497600,,456,4.267441860465116
5767142,5,B00D1VVT3C,"every actor in this series is top rate.  the story line is very well written.  it has humor along with plenty of action.  each character deserves an award.  i have watched many of the stories multiple times, just don't get tired of it.  waiting for number five to be released.  that heddy is something else, no other person could fit in that role.",1387065600,5,347,4.428571428571429
5767143,5,B00D1VVT3C,"This was a deal I could not pass up - seasons 1-4 of NCIS LA for $49.99. NCIS LA is the spin off of NCIS. This show has fast gained popularity and follows NCIS on Tuesday nights on CBS. I also purchased the season 5 episodes on instant stream so I now own every episode of this show. While NCIS LA doesn't have Gibbs the LA crew is led by OPS manager Henrietta Lange or ""Hetty"" as referred to by her team, played by Oscar winning actress Linda Hunt. (She won best supporting actress for playing a man in ""A Year of Living Dangerously"" with Mel Gibson)

Hopefully this show will prove to be as successful as NCIS. They are currently into season 5 so looks like they are off to a great start! I would have paid almost this much for any two seasons of this show had I bought the boxed seasons individually so this is really an awesome deal and saved me a lot of money on a great show that we have wanted to add to our home video library. We just received the set yesterday morning with free 2-day shipping that I get with my Amazon Prime membership. I opened the set and we watched the first DVD of season 1. We were surprised to find they included the 2 part pilot that aired as part of season 6 on NCIS which is really cool. We watched the special features which give you an introduction to the main cast members Special Agent""G"" Callan played by Chris O'Donnell, Sam Hanna, a former Navy Seal played by LL Cool J, and forensics expert Kensi Blye played by Daniela Ruah for a start. It also has a video of a rap song written and performed by LL Cool J that he did for his character in the pilot and gives the background on the wording in the song. The special features are something you don't get watching the episodes on demand on cable or instant streaming from Amazon and it nicely rounds out a highly entertaining show. This was a great buy of a great show and if you haven't seen any of the NCIS shows on CBS which I kinda doubt as NCIS is like one of the top rated shows on TV and has been for some time now but if you've never seen NCIS or NCIS Los Angeles you are really missing a great show. These shows are even better without the commercial interruptions which is something you definitely won't ever get with cable TV.",1386201600,10,2228,4.181395348837209
5767144,1,B00D1VVT3C,I like the show but you can buy the DVD separately for about half what you're selling it for here so in my advice buy the DVD separately on Amazon and you'll save a lot of money,1430956800,,177,3.810810810810811

I had watched NCIS LA on and off but it wasn't until I caught a marathon on USA that I really went back and watched it. I love Kensi and Deeks together. Best part about the show in my opinion. Already pre-ordered season 5.,1404259200,,283,4.071428571428571

5767178,5,B00D1VVT3C,Was glad to get all four seasons of NCIS: LA all at one time.  It was actually cheaper to buy all four in the pack than to purchase separately.  Can't wait to see the show again.,1391126400,,178,3.9166666666666665
5767179,3,B00D1VVT3C,"Amazon always gives me excellent service.  The condition of the product is excellent, and the product is always delivered in a timely manner.  The content of this particular video was not as good as we had hoped.  We have been watching NCIS, and it is excellent.  However NCIS: Los Angeles leaves a lot to be desired.  From the plot to the characters to the script to the acting it is very mediocre.",1391126400,,399,4.486111111111111

5767182,5,B00D1VVT3C,The dvds came in 3-4 days from when I ordered them.  They were far less expensive than if I bought them from a local store.  I bought all four for about the same price as one.  They were packaged in such a way you knew they were new.  My son loved them.,1390348800,,253,3.8076923076923075
