829283,3,6304288549,Does the dvd have the ending? With Rudy going to his house to get his wallet. Then getting married on the float by an alternative priest?,1013126400,2,137,4.3076923076923075
829284,4,6304288549,"If you enjoy watching Cheech, you will enjoy this movie.
This movie will be very funny for Latino viewers or people in general who are from Southern California.
Other viewers may not find it particularly funny especially if they are not familiar with the struggles of the Latino working class.  98% of what you see in this movie is true.  Sure there are a couple exaggerations, but for the most part, it is an eye opener.
Cheech does a great job and really expands his serious acting ability.  I really like when he is in Tijuana and sings in German for the German tourists (his character was previously in the army stationed in Germany).  I think his character, unlike most Hollywood movies, shows that most Americans of Mexican descent are decent, hard working people.",1009497600,6,770,4.723880597014926
829285,5,6304288549,"I haven't seen the DVD version, so I can only blab on and on about movie itself. A classic! Cheech is definitely influenced by a bit of Chaplin...not so much for the physical comedy but for his tramp-like persona who ends up warming the characters' and audience's hearts. Political themes, too...the Reagan-era round 'em up policies that did, in fact, ensnare citizens and permanent residents along with undocumented residents. The beginning shows how the INS busted the workers (and Cheech's Rudy), not the owner of the manufacturing plant.
Rudy also grows as an individual. He was living with his mom (the always good, when not typecast, Lupe Ontiveros), checking out French women after a failed marriage in Germany. By the end of the film, he's in love with a hard working Latina and is no longer the self-centered loaf he once was.
And funny! Tony Plano as Feo (and damn he's f'ugly!), Paul Rodriguez as cousin Javier (""Jesus esta en Tijuana???"") and Daniel Stern as the wily, entrepeneureal Jimmy round off the cast of sillies.",1007596800,,1032,4.902857142857143
829286,4,6304288549,"Cheech Marin gives a winning, likeable performance in yet another ""fish out of water"" story.  Cheech portrays Rudy Robles, a Los Angeleno of Hispanic descent who is mistakenly deported to Mexico when he is unable to produce identification at a factory that employs illegal immigrants.  Essentially, the film is an episodic comedy of Rudy's various attempts to get home.  This is, ultimately, a warmhearted comedy with a positive message that is marred only by some unnecessary profanity.  It's a shame, because the message of self-sacrifice ought to be viewed by younger people (Rudy gives up his seat on a truck entering the US so that an elderly woman can be with her husband).  Families might want to consider viewing the broadcast television version, which dubs over the profanity and includes other/alternate scenes, rather than this ""R"" rated release.  This is, arguably, Cheech's best film and really showcases his fine acting ability as well as his comedic talents.
This DVD is another in a series of older Universal films that have been licensed to Goodtimes Home Video.  Although the film is presented in full frame, this is one of the few times that it didn't seem to hurt the presentation.  As is the case with most Goodtimes releases, the only extras are chapter breaks and subtitles in English, French and Spanish.",987552000,7,1328,5.004545454545455
829287,2,6304288549,"Don't buy this version of Born in East L.A. They cut out the last half  hour of the film. Try finding a version with the original cover, that has  Cheech Marin crossing the border through barbed-wire. Otherwise, I would  give this movie a 5 star rating.",965174400,45,253,4.456521739130435
829288,4,6304288549,This movie was hysterical.  Daniel Stern and Cheech Marin turn in two good performances. It's about Cheech Marin being mistaken for an  illegal alien and getting shipped to Mexico. Most of the movie is about Cheech's  character trying to get back to the USA after being deported.,958521600,4,279,4.8936170212765955

829290,4,6304288549,"This movie starts out like most cheesy 80's movies but the movie actually ends up pretty good. Marin does an excellent job of writing and telling the true story through the eyes of Mexicans during the 1980's.  The movie is  very funny but at the same time tells a good message.  I would recommend  this movie to anybody wanting to see a movie without the usual violence and  explosions, that will make you laugh and think at the same time.",952300800,,439,4.4375
829291,4,6304288549,"The 85 minute theator version is a funny movie and relitively clean no swareing that I can remember and a sweet love story.  but there is a longer (105 minute?) verson the plays on tv sometimes.  it tells a much fuller  story. extra footage explains how rudy and girl friend end up on the parade  float.  it also fleshes out the mutual parrel rudy faces from both the  imagration officer and the coyotes... people who transport and sometimes  abuse illeagles.  in the longer version paul rodregus has even more funny  parts and the storycomes together as a whole.  It is a shame the longer  version is not avaible especaly in widescreen in DVDironicaly the girl next  door type that he falls in love with is much more beuitiful than the  knockout in the opening credits that atracts every male from firemen to  lowriders.  The love story touched my heart and it rang especaly true how  rudy and his girl end up ""sleeping together""  truely a movie you  could watch with your mother in the room.",943574400,5,993,4.577142857142857

It has 2 formats, wide screen and the ""fit to your tv"" one. It is the shorter version they played on TV, in
both formats. There are no extra deleted scenes, or longer cut options. It comes with 3 audio tracks, English
Spanish and French. Although ironically the Spanish version takes away from part of the story line. Since no one
is speaking English all the language related jokes are gone. They really should have left cheech and sterns characters
speaking English, to help highlight both ""fish out of water' they are both feeling. Daniel Stern's character is a much a
""gringo"" as Cheech Marin's character is, thats the funny part. despite being a mexican-american, Rudy is much more
American and has more in common with Jimmy then anyone else. And Kamala Lopez (Dolores) does a wonderful job
as the sweet innocent hardworking girl with big dreams to come to the USA.",1426809600,,973,4.565714285714286

I'm not really big on humor,
but this is kind of my life too.
They never believe me when I'm telling them the honest truth.
The government treats people as if they are always lying
if they don't have the paperwork:
sometimes even when they do...
Everybody is selling phoney green cards
and pretending they are this or that when they aren't.
It makes is very hard sometimes for people who are telling the truth.
Mexican American have been treated as second class citizens
for too long ( mostly in Texas and California), but all over the USA
and in the armed forces as well.
I think this movies is a good thing, but this situation  isn't really always
a joke and always funny.",1414800000,,717,4.473282442748092

830446,4,6304288549,"Give us your tired and poor but keep Cheech Marin. Cheech Marin writes, directs and stars in Born in East L.A., a hip, outrageous comedy that's based on his best-selling record parody.

The story follows Rudy (Marin), an American of Hispanic descent, whose south-of-the-border looks show him no mercy during an immigration raid in a migrant worker factory.

As his luck goes, he is caught with neither money nor his ID and is deported to Mexico - without speaking a word of Spanish! Unable to contact his vacationing family or his newly immigrated cousin (Paul Rodriguez), Rudy is in for a crazy ride as he tries every legal - and illegal - scheme he can think of to get back home to the States. He finds himself in jail, in love, and practically in-sane! Trouble follows him everywhere as he runs from la migra in this case of mistaken - or rather misplaced - identity.

This comedy flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 going on 15 years old in my Freshmen year in high school during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1987.",1393545600,,1045,4.489473684210527

The end is what kills it. In the end of the original VHS version they actually show cheech and the girl getting married.
That is whats missing from both of these editions. So if u don't mind missing out in watching the lovely female and cheech getting married then either edition will do.

For example, the orange vignette is a perfect little piece nicely scored with guitar music with a cute ending. It shows what a really nice guy ""Rudy"" is.  Later, he is paid back well for his generosity.  I won't spoil it by telling how.

The picture-in-front-of-the-phone gag is as good as it ever was, and the ""What's Happening Boys"" are as funny as ever.  It was great to be able to enjoy them all again.

The movie is rated ""R"", mostly for language and a minor incident with drugs... but a funny and unexpected one. There is also a small sexual scene with a blind passerby in front of the bar, but its not at all offensive.

Cheech Marin deserves some kind of award for this funny, funny movie!

That's OK, it was a good movie and we enjoyed it. The story involves an American of latino descent getting picked up as an illegal alien and deported to Mexico and his troubles in getting back into the country. It's funny, as you might expect, but it's also a somewhat touching drama and makes for engaging viewing. The movie is about 30 years old, but seems fresh and new and in tune with all the modern headlines. It's an interesting movie. Well done.

  There's a lot of basic fun, goofiness, and a lot of poking fun at prejudices. There is also a priceless scene where he teaches a group of Asians trying to sneak into the USA how to pass as east LA homeboys.

Robles makes the attempt to contact his family - but his non-English speaking cousin Javier (Paul Rodriguez) simply cannot help him. There are a good number of memorable (as well) as amusing scenes through out this movie. Perhaps not Cheech Marin's best work - but definitely worth pulling out of your DVD collection for a view when you're in the mood. Big-time / old school Cheech & Chong fans will undoubtedly enjoy this flick very much so.",1122854400,,704,4.64
830839,4,6304288549,"This movie is pure fun. It's not to be taken so seriously. This is a great movie to watch alone when you really need a laugh.  This movie is great to watch with my grown children because we laugh together just like we did when we watched it years ago, in our happy home when they were carefree children, before all the world crap, job closings and war hungry people trying to blow us off this earth, Aids, etc..  Maybe if I were an angry, put - up - on Latino - Black -  etc., I would find some parts ""not so funny""?  It's refreshing to watch a movie that doesn't depend on 4 letter words, sex or racial insults to be funny. Certain movies are made to make us laugh and sometimes when we let down our guards ( racism-lonliness-fear ) and open our tight lips to laugh we ""breathe."" The next time you are down watch this movie or ""Soapdish"" or ""Half-baked"" -  ""CaveMan"", ""My Blue Heaven"", etcc.. I am a wife, proud granny, positive Black American. Find peace and Joy - share a smile.  Thanks.",1076112000,4,990,4.23936170212766
830840,4,6304288549,"This version of the film on DVD is better than the one from goodtimes productions. Yet both versions on DVDs are very edited from the original version. The film is a little longer, on scene in particular is the marriage scene at the end, how else did Rudy end up in a float at the parade, and that is just one major one. This DVD is good, but the old VHS version seems more ""complete."" I only wish Cheech had the support to create other such films!",1053820800,35,448,4.160919540229885

So many little ""inside jokes"" for those who know anything about the mexican culture. I love this movie.  My one and only complaint is that the entire version of the movie is yet to be released, even in the new DVD of 2003, the movie is incomplete.  That my friends is unacceptable!",1040774400,6,400,4.391891891891892
830843,3,6304288549,"I love this movie, so I was going to buy this DVD no matter what.  But I wish they would have included the alternate ending.  Also, the DVD isn't widescreen and there are no extras whatsoever.  I'm hoping a ""collector's edition"" will be released with these features but I doubt ""Born in East L.A."" is popular enough to warrant that.
As far as the movie itself, it is very funny and is full of hilarious characters.",1039478400,11,414,4.421052631578948

7866857,5,6304288549,"There's even a song to go with it imitating Bruce's song. This comedy is not to be taken seriously as it is politically incorrect and has all the cliches about Mexican Americans, but who doesn't know about this from Cheech Marin who has a cornerstone of comedy making fun of his own race to the absolute hilt. From Fresno references, lottery tickets, bean burritos that taste like steak, to summertime blues with a Mex-Tex band to helping Asian Mexican Chinese to speak and act like regular USA home boys. The scriptwriters had fun, and so does Cheech.",1514332800,,552,4.701030927835052
