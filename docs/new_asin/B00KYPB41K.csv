It is a superb blend of historical film footage and actors portraying people who lived through that war. I think what makes it great is the actors were living, not a fiction, but real peoples lives as told by their personal diaries written at the time.",1441756800,,429,4.558441558441558
8662711,5,B00KYPB41K,"I would give this documentary/docudrama 10 stars.  It has been edited in an effective manner.  It should how horrible the war was by using the stories of individuals who lived through this war of total destruction.  This war was totally avoidable.  In fact, it was the result of one stupid decision followed by another stupid reaction.

World War I was possibly even more influential than World War II.  So many of us know so much more about World War II, but almost nothing about World War I.  I was able to watch it on Netflix.  I have seen it 2 or 3 times.  It really is that good.

The producers use old photographs and film along with actors acting out the matters discussed in the diaries.  It is really very well done.",1439164800,,725,4.416666666666667
8662712,5,B00KYPB41K,"From the only review of this series, and thank you for your time writing it, I've decided to purchase the series. After watching the first episode on Netflix, I'm totally hooked. This will be a set of films to see again and a good part of my WWI documentary collection.",1437523200,,269,4.4

in the world up to that time. August 1914 to November 1918 demonstrated
the shear futility of war while displaying the callousness and horror
that mankind was able to thrust on itself. We are observing the second
year of the 100th anniversary of the Great War with numerous books,
documentaries and films. I suspect that not many will pay a lot of
attention to the observance of this world changing event.

But we should.

I have been captivated with the Great War since I purchased a book
entitled The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century. This was a
book I picked up in Montreal in October 2005 as I attended an IAQG
meeting. It is a companion to the PBS series of the same name. The
focus of the book was the effect the war had on subsequent history. It
was interesting as it gave extensive coverage to the poets and artists
of the time - especially those who served in the British army -
Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, for example. This book and the PBS
series sparked my interest.

Since then I have devoted a considerable part of my life and my library
to the Great War. My fascination with it only grows.

So, it was with a great deal of anticipation that I started the Netflix
streaming series called 14 Diaries of the Great War.

I have seen numerous movies and documentaries about the Great War, but
none as well presented, poignant or hard hitting as this series.
Produced by the BBC and released in connection with the 100th
anniversary of the start of the war, this series presents the thoughts,
beliefs and experiences of 14 people who were caught up in the
maelstrom which was the Great War. The people who are featured in the
series (authors of the diaries) are listed in the wikipedia description
of the series: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_-
_Diaries_of_the_Great_War.

The artistic approach to the series is the best I have seen. Supporting
the diary accounts with live actors and archival footage of war and
domestic scenes is riveting. The transition from color to black and
white footage gives a sense of accuracy and immediacy to the stories
being described in the diaries.

These diaries are presented in the context of the overall strategic
situation of the war during the time covered - with clear animation.
These three factors - live actors living out the diary entries;
archival footage supporting the story; and the animation combine to
make this the most effective depiction of the horrors of war on people
I have seen.

The focus of this series is people. The universality of the war
experience on soldiers, nurses, civilians, prisoner-of-war, and
children is demonstrated by the series. It is clear that all the people
of the world whose countries were directly involved in the war suffered
the same misery: the death of loved ones and, almost worse, the
inability to bury them; hunger, starvation, lack of the fundamentals of
life - food, water, shelter, proper medical treatment, etc. This is
very dramatically presented as the story rapidly presents short
excerpts from the diaries of French, German, Austria, Turkish, British,
Australian etc. diarists.

The diaries of the soldiers on all sides suffered from the same
privations, especially in the trenches. They were mislead by pompous,
uninformed (and uncaring) generals, who stuck with obviously outmoded
tactics (incessant bombardments of the enemy lines - a week long
bombardment before the Somme); over the top, suicidal charges which
were easily dispensed by scores of machine guns; antiquated and ill
conceived philosophies about how to keep the soldiers and civilians in
support of the war - and so on.

Four of the first five episodes cover ground which is familiar to those
who have studied the Great War: causes of the conflict; opening
battles; misdirected tactics, etc. In spite of the familiarity of the
subject, the presentation is captivating. Episode 4, in my opinion
gazed too long on the sexual aspects of the war - young men away from
home, the emerging sexual revolution among women. etc. The main point
was made early, then repeated many times during the episode. That is my
only serious criticism of the series, having watched six of the eight
episodes.

Episode 6 ""The Home Front"" was particularly devastating as it portrayed
the horrors thrust on the civilian population. If you do not have a
""hard crust,"" do not watch this episode. It is almost more than I could
bear. The most poignant story in this episode was the story of Elfriede
Kuhr - a young German girl - a victim of the propaganda and super
nationalism of the early days of the war. As a totally committed school
girl, she strips her home when food and metal is needed to support the
German war effort. She volunteers in a children's hospital - watching
over dozens of malnourished babies by herself the entire evening. Her
failed suicide attempt is emblematic of the despair and homelessness of
people caught up in this catastrophe. The actress, Elise Monse, is
brilliant.

At the beginning of this review I said that everyone should pay
attention to this world changing event. There is no better way to do
that than to watch this hard hitting series. You will not look at war
the same.",1432944000,,5249,4.826473859844271
