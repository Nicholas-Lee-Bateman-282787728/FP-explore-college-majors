819308,1,6304243421,"that this movie would never end. This movie made me want to shoot myself  in the face. Some of the dead bodies and stuff are real, but it's no more  gruesome than that show about tornadoes I saw on Discovery the other night.  Don't try to find another movie that's more realistic or w/ better death  scenes, just save that money for Colt 45 and porn.",968457600,2,350,4.257575757575758
819309,1,6304243421,"this is the most abhorrent piece of crap that has ever been filmed.  never  have i seen the amount of useless trash that i have in this film.  it is  filled with boring narration and literally NO violence and NO gore.  After  hearing everyone talk about this video I figured it'd be great.  I rented  this video thinking that i would be disturbed or scared.  Instead, I ended  up feeling empty... bored... and a little poorer... if you want to do your  deed for society... STOP talking about this video... and for god sakes...  don't rent it.",968457600,,542,4.474226804123711
819310,1,6304243421,"Pure & utter crap! Don't waste your money. I bought my F.O.D. 1-6 set  for $30, & that was $30 too much. If you want to see fake killings, buy  a horror movie!",961286400,,159,3.787878787878788
819311,4,6304243421,"Well, F.O.D is the most famed of it's kind, but the fact remains that most of the scenes are staged. Easy way to tell: doesn't it look a little too cinematic to be ""accidental""? The autopsies, animal slaughter,  and other stuff without a stupid explanation is the only real stuff here.  Other mondo films are better(like Traces of Death), but this does remain  one of my favs.  Happy Hunting!  P.S.  Dr. Gross isn't a real  doctor.",954288000,2,431,4.592105263157895
819312,1,6304243421,Unless you want to see fake death scenes don't waste your money on these tapes. 95% of the footage in these tapes are fake. If you want to see real death try Banned from TV 1 & 2.,940636800,5,179,3.736842105263158
819313,5,6304243421,"When I was around 13 or so, a good friend of mine (who was in his 20's) rented Faces of Death (the original) and I was like, ""God that's sick.""  But, I guess that was the point.  Now, almost ten years later,  I was blessed with the fortune of getting finding this boxed set.  These  movies ARE gross, sick, demented, and not for people who don't like being  grossed out.  But, they are also perfect for those who want to SEE what the  rest of the world doesn't want you to see.  They are also one of the  coolest ""cult"" video series ever.  You really can't go wrong with  these movies, even if after the second movie they DO get kinda cheesey.  But you HAVE to hear the ""Faces of Death"" song that is on the end  of the 4th video.  It is truly funny and plain out FOUL.  The movies really  are good, and they are finally available to the public without them being  ripped off, badly dubbed, 20 year old copies.  Enjoy.",937008000,14,917,4.166666666666667

7866102,4,6304243421,"The first movie was pretty cool, and as long as you don't google what parts of the video is real and what is fake, it can be hard to distinguish it at times. I liked the first narrator, the second guy that takes over the show just makes it so corny.

I'd love to see this come out on DVD in better quality, or for a new more realistic one to be released.

There are some real images of death in this movie, so if you think you can handle that sort of stuff, this could be the movie for you.",1269388800,,490,3.8415841584158414
7866103,5,6304243421,"I saw the faces of death several years ago and the images left in my mind still haunt me.  I often wondered why anyone would make such a film and why anyone would want to see such horror. Then I realized it's because all of us have that thing called morbid curiosity.  Like when there's a wreck on the highway and everyone stops to see what's happening when what they really want to see is if anyone's dead.  The scene in these movies that I can't get out of my head is when the guy is skydiving and lands in a crocodile pit and all of his insides are floating on top of the water-- anyway, it looked pretty real to me so if real blood and guts is your thing......",1154217600,,664,4.0534351145038165
7866104,4,6304243421,I was in high school when these were in the video stores. I rented the first two.then they were pulled off the shelves. I could not belive I found them.,1105660800,,152,4.1
7866105,1,6304243421,"Have you ever seen something so shockingly horrible that you immediately wished you'd never seen it?  Too late, it's in your head now and can't really be washed away.

That's what you get with Faces of Death.  Plus, there's a good plenty of staged scenes that are being passed off as actual footage of something gruesome.  It is gruesome, but still a hoax.

I saw this when I was in my early teens and guess what... those images still rattle around in my head to no good effect.  Fill your mind with something that will benefit it.",1094515200,4,531,4.422680412371134
7866106,4,6304243421,"After reviewing the Traces of Death, personally I thought the Faces of Death was a whole lot better. The Faces of Death basicly goes through the different ways people or animals  have died or been killed.  I didn't find it scary, but one doesn't always realize how they could die. I believe viewing for some should be warned that this may not be suitable for some. The videos remind me of something that might be on the Discovery Channel, or parts could be on the unsolved mysteries.  It wasn't bad..I would recommend it for those who are curious of how many ways one might be found dead, or die or be killed. If one is looking for a movie, this isn't it.  If one is curious on autopsy, this video is far better than the video I got on autopsy
thru the eyes of a detective.",1032912000,5,773,4.273972602739726
7866107,5,6304243421,"Well what can i say?
Its an all time classic!!!
It is just gore,gore and more gore.
If you like to watch real stuff that
Is just sick then this is for you.
Its cost me over $230 australian and it worth
every cent.",1006041600,,213,3.8636363636363638
7866108,1,6304243421,"Don't buy this! I recently purchased this set, thank god I didn't pay full price!  The videos have some real footage that makes you think about your own life, but most of the footage appears to be staged and is extremely old. Just before something happens the camera tends to looks away and comes back to show you somthing dead, but because you don't see it, it is easy to figure out that most of this is probably fake.  Don't get me wrong, some of it is real and is sick, but it's not worth buying the whole set.  Tape #5 & #6 contains some of the same footage from #3 and #4. Mostly shows dead animals from slaughter houses, cadavers, old police footage and is very slow. It's easy to see that many of the deaths are completely fake and were staged.  Be prepared to fall asleep. It's not worth [price]! Spend your money on a something else, trust me!!  Try buying one of the videos first (make sure it's not #1)and you'll see what I mean.",1000425600,5,940,4.258426966292135
7866109,5,6304243421,"I just finished watching Faces of Death #4. What really intrigues me about this video is the imagination of the people who created it.  Who are the idiots who sat around thinking about a heavily weighted, multi-pronged piece of metal crushing a magician's head right before our very eyes? Who thought of the idea of the shaven-headed woman desperately clutching the wall in an effort to stave off going to the electric chair? Who are the authors? What kinds of personalities do they have? Do they take acid? Do they roll around in their offices laughing their heads off as they generate ideas for these videos? I would love to meet them, or at least to know more about them.",995241600,2,674,4.616666666666666
