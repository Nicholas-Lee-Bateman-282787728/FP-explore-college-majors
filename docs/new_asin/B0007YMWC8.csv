Instead of robbing a casino for money, they rob a race track for a horse..well maybe its not like Oceans Eleven..hmmm..what was I on?? Anyhow, this is a good movie. DVD is great, good audio but don't expect any dvd extras, all you get is scene selection and play movie.",1314057600,,412,4.506666666666667
