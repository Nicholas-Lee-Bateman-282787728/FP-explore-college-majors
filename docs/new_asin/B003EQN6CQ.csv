8395602,5,B003EQN6CQ,"This 90 minute DVD is as engaging as it is informative... the producers made this story simple enough for school age children to grasp and yet provocative enough for adults to want to learn more.  I always wonder HOW in the world could dinosaurs carcasses decaying under the sea have produced more than a trillion barrels of oil???  Dang, I mean really, how many dinosaurs were there?  Then in a straight forward way this DVD answered the HOW of oil creation.... also, it concludes by reminding us of the consequences of our planet's oil addiction.  Brilliant.  Highly Recommended for all ages.",1284595200,11,594,4.841584158415841
