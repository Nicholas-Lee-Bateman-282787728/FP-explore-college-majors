As others have stated, this seems to be region-free, so it should play fine in the US without a multi-region BD player (which I have, but I didn't have to set it to ""B"" to get it to play).  The audio tracks are in Italian primarily, but also the original English.  Subtitles are only Italian however.

Oh, and Marlo - wear a tie, for God's sake.",1522713600,,545,4.201923076923077
8631263,4,B00H9O8Q0Q,"One of the great film parodies and an outstanding homage to film noir. I wish Criterion would give this film the deluxe treatment. There are several alternate scenes that were shown only on TV broadcasts - including a more extensive scene featuring Burt Lancaster from ""The Killers"" washing the car windshield while Rigby Reardon speaks with him. This film has never been released with any extra features. I would love to see a documentary on the creative process of how they took all those classic film scenes and reverse-edited them to fit a new plot. To me this film is Steve Martin's finest hour and I'm sad the sequel promised in the film was never made.",1491436800,2,659,4.689655172413793
8631264,5,B00H9O8Q0Q,"I love this movie. I have always wanted to see it in Blu-ray format, and I am glad I got this one. It played perfectly fine on my region a (United States) Blu-ray player. I can watch this movie a million times and I will never be sick of it.",1478131200,3,241,3.84
8631265,5,B00H9O8Q0Q,"This Italian Blu-ray is Region A/B/C.  Not B/2 .The Product Details, and warning box,  are wrong....at least with the Italian Disc.  It plays fine on my Oppo Blu-ray Player.  I bought mine from Seller ""DAAVEEDEE"".  You will have to change the settings to English...and the subtitles to off.",1461283200,5,290,4.958333333333333
