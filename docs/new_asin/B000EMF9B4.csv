2522346,5,B000EMF9B4,"This DVD is unique in being sincere, candid, and considerate of sexuality. Explicit and unabashed - how sex is supposed to be.  Realistic but still personal, and thankfully, none of the rudimentary film work that you find in porn flicks.

I can say that I have felt at a disadvantage with dating and what women expect from me in the bedroom.  Learning how to produce an orgasm in a woman's body is the first step, and this DVD helped me with that.  When I got into a new relationship, from the beginning we were entirely straight forward and comfortable with one other, and this was in our sexual lives too.  Fun, simple, and loving sex, different then either of us have had before.

This DVD introduced me to an entirely new way of thinking of my sex life.  The orgasm shown is not focused on just the up and over, there is a lot more to it than that.",1182643200,5,852,4.320754716981132
2522347,5,B000EMF9B4,"These are great DVDs, and I own several.  The technique in this DVD expands the concept of an orgasm, from taking a woman over the edge to one in which the experience is expanded.

 I really wanted my partner to know how to get me off better, and I notice how much he needs examples of getting off better, so I really wanted him to see this DVD.  It doesn't look like what he has done to my body in the past, so I know at first it was one of those things that was really hard for him to see.  For me too, I kept waiting for the woman to have a big, wonderful climax!  But toward the end you realize that the orgasm she feels just keeps going and going, and could continue for a long time, it doesn't have to end.

I would only recommend this product for people interested in expanding sensation though, not for people that want a quickie.",1181952000,11,838,4.073170731707317
2522348,5,B000EMF9B4,"My partner and I added deliberate orgasm to our sex life on a regular basis. Learning to relax completely while my clitoris is directly stimulated has gone from feeling vulnerable to feeling cherished. After almost a year of daily deliberate orgasm, I still find whole new vistas of sensation to explore, most recently through exploring wider ranges of pressure.

Don't be put off by the low-budget production. I'm also finding orgasm to bring me powerfully into the present moment, and my ability to stay in the present moment in the rest of my life has increased as well.",1181606400,11,573,4.846938775510204
2522349,5,B000EMF9B4,"This DVD gave an advanced demo of the Deliberate Orgasm technique, which I have been happily using since I watched their first movie in 1999.  The new information is great for lovers of the female orgasm.  ""Peaking"" is a way to have the sex  keep building way beyond the point that it would normally peak and wane.  After 8 years of using Deliberate Orgasm my partner's privates have gotten even more sensitive than they used to be.  Her erogenous zones are more erogenous.  Since I started using some of the Peaking techniques she wants it more than ever.  After the first couple of years we were together, we both started worrying that the romantic side was cooling off.  Boy, I haven't worried about that for a long, long time.  We used to like watching those hardbodies making love in the Bahamas to get the juices flowing, but these ones actually made us both better in bed.  I learn something every time I watch it.  I would give a strong recommendation for the first Deliberate Orgasm DVD and this one together.",1180656000,32,1018,4.6
2522350,1,B000EMF9B4,"Pathetic. Pseudo sex therapist makes low budget snoozer. Don't expect to learn anything or get excited watching this. If you make it to the end, you should get out more.",1155686400,6,169,4.666666666666667
2522351,5,B000EMF9B4,"I was introduced to The Welcomed Consensus in 1998 by a woman friend of mine. She and I enjoyed our sex life together, and she kept piquing my interest with this thing she called DOing, which was apparently some special way to stroke her clitoris that she found tremendously pleasurable. D.O., it turned out, is an acronym for Deliberate Orgasm.

D.O. Volume II - Peaking has long been my favorite of this video library. The video starts with the instructors introducing the concept of ""peaking"". And the viewer is invited to consider taking on additional viewpoints to the ones he or she already has about orgasm.

Then the demonstration begins with the techniques of DOing and Peaking a woman. The entire focus is on her orgasm. She lies back with her genitals facing the camera. Her genitalia are strikingly alive and animated from the start, contracting visibly, as well as flushing, engorging and changing over the course of the demonstration. The doer describes in detail what he's experiencing as he stimulates her clitoris, the sense that ""now she's going up"", ""now she's going down"", and what he's doing to ""peak"" her. Progressively higher and more intense orgasmic peaks are built throughout this video.

The whole DOing section is filmed as a single, continuous shot, composed mostly of a close-up on her p----. I found I had to watch it a couple of times before I was able to take it all in. When the camera does pull out, a deep flush across her face corroborates her moans, demonstrating that she is genuinely getting off on the strokes. She lucidly describes what she's feeling in her body while getting DOne.

This video has simple sets, and a noticeable absence of ""slickness"" to the production. It's evident from watching it that these instructors are serious about their research and having people's sex lives get better. That is what we experienced.",1153872000,41,1869,4.867924528301887

This female orgasm video changed the way I experience orgasm, much deeper and sensational. Best of all, this Doing Method is easy and simple for both women and men.
I heard a lot about the 15 minute orgasm and slow sex. After much research, I found these Deliberate Orgasm videos and as it turns out deliberate orgasm is the source of the slow sex inspiration and this shows a man bringing a woman to orgasm for 30 minutes plus. Whether you like how it is presented or not, you must experiment with the technique for yourself, it will blow her mind, it did mine.",1306368000,12,906,6.141732283464567

I read about it and it is so fun to see it in action, Deliberate Orgasm works, it brought so much fun to our sex.
We go back to using it regularly and it keeps on bringing new surprises to our sex together.

8111133,5,B000EMF9B4,"This is an educational DVD, with an emphasis on what the producers refer to as the Deliberate Orgasm technique - they call it D.O.ing.  My partner and I got a lot out of watching these DVDs, as we had gotten to a place in our relationship we were no longer even interested in sex.

This video set discusses the sexual cycle of what they call tumescence, which brought a whole other element of excitement to both of us in the bedroom.  The method of the man DOing the woman is clearly shown, with consistent lecture throughout the demonstration.  There is an ease now for my partner to navigate his way around my clitoris.  He has found my ""spot"" and is learning to ""peak"" me to give me longer orgasms.  He takes the lead now in bed, and enjoys everything he is doing to my body.  Our sex life is so much more fun, and has gone beyond the point either of us thought possible before.

This DVD is also available on amazon as a 2 DVD set under Deliberate Orgasm Duet.
Highly recommend the Duet video set, for enhancing - or in our case reviving - your sexual desire!",1187136000,10,1063,4.306532663316583
8111134,5,B000EMF9B4,"Wow.  This really opened my mind to the possibilities of what an orgasm can be for a woman and man to experience together.  This is a rare find.  You can see exactly how a man can give a woman an orgasm in great detail.  There are many close-ups of the instructor demonstrating the Deliberate Orgasm technique, and the instructors talk about what is happening in her body, which I found extremely useful.  It takes the mystery out of what orgasm is and how to have it happen.  The peaks and valleys can be felt and seen in her body as they occur, which expanded my view of just having a climax at the end as the big goal.",1182988800,4,621,4.220338983050848
