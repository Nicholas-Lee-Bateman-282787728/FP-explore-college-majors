8255711,1,B0014H63EA,"One of the stupidest and nonsensical ""documentaries"" that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The DVD espouses typical anti-Catholic rants and fantasies that characterize fanatical fundamentalist hallucinations and unrealities.

This is 66 minutes of my life wasted watching this nonsense...",1320624000,,300,6.142857142857143
8255712,3,B0014H63EA,"The movie is well made and easy to follow.  My only concern is that some of the information in this is hard to verify.  Additionally, this is made by a highly prolific writer.  Considering the obscurity of the information contained within, I am somewhat concerned about whether true diligence and an un-biased approach were used.  The tendency with this type of material is for an author to get an idea and then build a case around it, regardless of whether the pieces really check out as fact.

This is the kind of material I would not take too seriously unless I could see it in print, verify a list of sources, and then do follow-up for myself.",1257120000,6,647,4.495726495726496
8255713,1,B0014H63EA,"Unfortunately, the persecution of the Catholic Church is the last bigotry still accepted by the world today.  The dogmatic teachings of the Catholic Church are immutable while the world around it constantly changes its moral code.  This film is entertaining in the way Dan Brown's books have been; that is to say, a bit of historical fact mixed with untruth to create a believable, but completely false premise.

The Sovereign Order of Malta is and always has been a committed religious entity devoted to the sick and the poor and obedient to the precepts of Christianity.  The highest levels of the Order take a vow of chastity and poverty to serve the poor and sick, and since this is unfashionable today, it becomes the focus of attack by secularists and those against Christianity (which opposes the world's idea of freedom and morality).

There are no secret cult meetings in the Order, nor is there anything opposed to Christian values.  The Order saved the Christian world from becoming overrun by Islam several times, for which we should all be grateful.  Today, it serves the poor throughout the world from Africa to Haiti to NY City.

It is a wonderful organization that is devoted to Christian values and has absolutely nothing to do with Free Masonry, which has intentionaly sought to adapt and copy the trappings of the Order of Malta to distort its image in order to destroy it.

It is unfortunate that this film has been produced, it is a complete disservice to the Truth.  It has NOTHING to do with the real Order of Malta. See [...]",1236384000,6,1549,4.746268656716418
8255714,4,B0014H63EA,"The Knights of Malta seem to have been called by several different titles over the years, but what appears consistent from this documentary is that it was a secret society whose motives remained sinister and linked to the occult. Also discussed is the rise of the radical Catholic Church and the collapse of earlier Christian values and beliefs.",1216425600,,345,4.9655172413793105
8255715,4,B0014H63EA,"While the Knights of the Templar have the most notoriety, the knights of Malta have a full history of their own. The graphic creations were very good quality and aided in the story telling greatly. The loyalty and dedication involved in this knighthood is incredible. Excellent informational movie.",1214352000,,298,5.229166666666667
8255716,3,B0014H63EA,"This documentary asserts that many of the problems we experience today can be traced back to the eleventh century when European Christian zealots went on a killing spree against Jews, Muslims, and all those they considered ""unenlightened."" This, the producers say, was the result of the breakdown of original core Christian beliefs at the rise of the radical Catholic Church. Learn about the Knights of Malta, a secret society whose name evolved, but  whose motives remained sinister and linked to the occult.",1213833600,3,509,5.2073170731707314
8255717,4,B0014H63EA,"Before viewing this film, I had heard of the Knights Templar, but never the Knights of Malta.  There are many similarities between the two orders, and this film does a great job of introducing the Knights of Malta and their history.  If these orders are interesting to you, this is a must see.",1213401600,2,293,4.509433962264151
