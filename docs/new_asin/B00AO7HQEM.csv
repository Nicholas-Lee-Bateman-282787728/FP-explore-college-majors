8555205,2,B00AO7HQEM,"This is worse than a one star movie, but I do not use the word ""hate"" loosely. Simply put, even for free this is a waste of your time. The only reason to purchase this dvd is because you love the wrestler Kurt Angle and you want to own everything he does. But if that is not your thinking, then you should know that the acting and the storyline cannot possibly be worse.",1408579200,,370,4.082191780821918
8555206,1,B00AO7HQEM,"I bought this movie only because my uncle plays a minor roll in it.  I think it has to go down as one of the all time worst movies ever made.  I think it may actually be in the queue for a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 screening to be mocked by robots.  Yes, it is that bad!  If you like cussing, monster trucks, wrestlers playing horrible rolls, movies with horrible story lines, this is right up your alley!",1401408000,,408,4.1923076923076925
8555207,4,B00AO7HQEM,Great Grade B SCi Fi movie with ridiculous plot.  Film is a total knockout.  Outstanding acting from TNA Wrestling starJames Storm.  Fun Fun Fun!,1375401600,,145,4.958333333333333
8555208,1,B00AO7HQEM,"Unlikeable Mike (Kurt Angle) accidentally finds an ancient Druid Ruin necklace buried in monster truck country. He wears the necklace and is transformed into the equally unlikeable Thule seeking out 3 more ruin necklaces through carnage. Gunnar (James Storm) has one of the necklaces Thule needs.

The plot was confusing and didn't make any sense. In fact it still doesn't. American Druids? There is no character build up, which was just as well as no one can act in this film. The dialouge was the pits. Country western music mixed in with a tune from Anti-Flag. A tattooed woman with arms bigger than my thighs. YIKES!  Worse than a Tempe video.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or sex. Appears to be some brief mud wrestling nudity...another scene that didn't make much sense either.",1365206400,,781,4.901515151515151
8555209,4,B00AO7HQEM,"This was a fun pic.  I don't think I've seen this many wrestlers in one movie before.  ODB takes out the trash!!! Psycho Sid's appearance is too short.  Didn't know James Storm could act.  And ofcourse, Kurt Angle kicks ass.  I bought this movie. Probably try to get it signed.",1364342400,2,277,4.46
