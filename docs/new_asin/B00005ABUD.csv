7935310,5,B00005ABUD,"she actually won the Emmy for her work in one particular episode in season 2 of The Bionic Woman, the one when she is kidnapped and switched with Lisa Galloway who was spending time in prison.  I believe the emmy was won for part 2 of the two part episode, but both were AMAZINGLY powerful, emotional, episodes which shows how one can begin to question their own sanity when being told they are not who they are!",1163548800,,412,4.35064935064935
7935311,3,B00005ABUD,Another reviewer claimed this is a bootleg. Not so. Is being sold on Amazon UK along the with the Six Million Dollar Man. All you need is a region-free DVD player and you're all set!,1160870400,,182,4.228571428571429
7935312,4,B00005ABUD,"Although she didn't win an Emmy award until about the third season, I enjoyed this show a great deal at the time. I'm hoping that the show will be released on DVD. The episode that Lindsay won an Emmy for Best Actress in a Dramatic Series was the 2nd or 3rd time she played a dual role as Jamie and as Lisa. In that episode, both women suffered identity crises. Jamie was institutionalized and drugged, and they tried to ""brainwash"" her into thinking she was her ""twin"" (by plastic surgery.) Lisa, on the other hand, had convinced herself that she truly WAS Jamie, and longed for Jamie's sense of family she had with relatives. That two-part episode is my favorite of all. When Oscar Goldman tests Jamie's hearing from hundreds of feet away, she responds, ""Oscar, I can hear you! I can hear you!"" my heart always skipped a beat, because Oscar KNOWS it's Jamie. I DO hope they release at least THAT episode, because it is by far the best one.",1150502400,,941,4.476744186046512
7935313,5,B00005ABUD,"This is an official release of Season 1 Bionic Woman. It was released only in the U.K.  You would need a region free dvd player to play it.

The sound and picture quality is excellent especially when you compare it to the bootlegs that are out there.",1149811200,3,250,4.297872340425532
7935314,4,B00005ABUD,"Contrary to a previous posting, THE BIONIC WOMAN has been legally and officially released in both the UK and France by Universal.  Season 1 is available as of this date in both countries, and I believe I saw an advert for Australia as well.  Other 3-episode discs were officially released prior to the Season 1 set in the UK.  They are, of course, Region 2/PAL discs.  SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN has also been released similarly.

I have seen these discs, and the quality is excellent, by the way.

Why the series is being held up in the States is beyond me, especially with the plethora of choices we have out already.

I respectfully request that posters do their research, or at least make sure they know what they're talking about, before posting erroneous information for public consumption.",1148860800,11,792,4.737226277372263
7935315,1,B00005ABUD,"This series is NOT on DVD legally anywhere, which is why Amazon doesn't carry it themselves but rather only through third-party sellers. Don't support poor-quality bootlegs put out by international criminal cartels.",1147564800,2,215,5.75
7935316,5,B00005ABUD,I love this title. I can not wait until they release The Bionic Woman series on DVD. Plus the Six Millon Dollar Man series.,1140912000,9,123,4.166666666666667
