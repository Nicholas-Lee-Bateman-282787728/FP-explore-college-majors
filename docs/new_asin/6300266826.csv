292264,3,6300266826,"""Prisoners of the Lost Universe"" is a mid-80's fantasy piece that is so ludicrous that it's funny. I debated long and hard about what rating to give it, but finally settled on three stars as the unintentionally amusing moments are both mirthful and plentiful.

The film starts with an annoying television science reporter, Carrie Madison (Kay Lenz), hosting her weekly show ""The Weird and the Wacky."" In this introductory segment you see her go face to face with a hooded cobra. Due to some minor musical exposure the cobra goes limp and Carrie turns to the camera and offers up the first in a countless bounty of deliciously bad lines in the film: ""You can put a snake to sleep with a high B-Flat...remember, it may only work on snakes that like music."" I was so entertained by this scene I had to watch it several times. Carrie then goes to meet Dr. Hartmann (Kenneth Hendel) at his lab. My first question about the film was this: if she's in Los Angeles, why does her 280ZX have right hand steering? Never mind, because during the drive the LA basin gets rocked by earthquakes, making her swerve and run Dan (Richard Hatch) off the road in his right hand drive pickup truck. Their first meeting is rather confrontational needless to say, but she has to run along to see Dr. Hartmann, leaving Dan stranded.

Carrie arrives at Hartmann's lab, and he demonstrates his matter transmitter that can send objects into a parallel universe. We start with Carrie's compact, but soon enough due to another tremor, Hartman falls into the beam and is gone. Dan comes to the door, and they both investigate and during yet another aftershock, both of them fall into the matter transmitter beam and are whisked away. This scene not only has hilarious special effects, but the implausibility of the falls into the machine are likewise humorous.

The humans appear in a mountainous desert. Carrie finds a caveman in a tar pit and helps him out. After reuniting with Dan, they encounter weird natives with flashing red eyes who get run off a cliff by the friendly caveman. After Dan and Carrie scale a vertical cliff (Carrie in high heels), they meet up with a green man who speaks good English. Carrie's first order of business is to take a bath in a lake (of course), where she is promptly attacked by a ""water beast"". The green guy shoots the beast with his ""pod gun"" and leaves them to roll around in the grass together.

No sooner has Dan gone to scout for food than an evil warlord, Kleel, played with extreme hamminess by the great John Saxon, shows up to take Carrie to be his because her hair is the color of sunshine. (Really.) Kleel has a gun and shoots Dan who apparently falls dead. Kleel and company ride off to his fortress with Carrie, and a dwarf with a Scottish accent, Malachi (Peter O'Farrell), starts to pilfer Dan's body. It turns out that Dan was only stunned by the bullet, and he promises his watch to Malachi in exchange for passage to Kleel's palace. First they have to stop by a friend of Malachi's to get horses, which spawns another of the most unintentionally hilarious lines of dialogue in film history: ""He's got a sort of charm that'll make a snake vomit, but he sells good horses.""

Enroute to find Kleel there are many bogus sword fights, a duel with some idiots wearing white sheets in the style of a very low-budget Halloween costume, a close call with an oil fire, and clashes with guys dressed like the grim reaper complete with scythes for hands and tennis shoes. It may be incoherent, but at least it's entertaining. The production team obviously had a lot of ideas for this movie, and none of them were edited out. I think of the final product as something that would happen when a bunch of teenage boys watch ""Land of the Lost"" for hours on end while playing ""Dungeons and Dragons"" and drinking vast quantities of Cherry Robitussin. Weird and wacky is right.

The get to Kleel's abode and find that Dr. Hartmann is now Kleel's sorcerer and has provided him with guns and nitroglycerin. Hartmann is a problem child and loves the power of being allied with Kleel. Kleel tries to curry favor with Carrie with jewels and wine (that's a no go), while Hartmann gets blackmailed by the others in a convenient though nonsensical plot twist. Ultimately they fight their way out, blow up Kleel and his palace and condescend to Hartmann, who they bring along only to help find the spot to stand on to get teleported back to their own universe. They find Carrie's compact, and Dan and Carrie get zapped out of the picture and hopefully into obscurity. The end.

This movie has so much going on and so many diverse and superfluous subplots that it's hard to stay focused on. I suppose ""Battlestar Galactica"" fans will like this because of Hatch, and while fans of fantasy may like this as well, some will be disappointed with the lack of production values, poor acting, awful script, and disjointed editing. People who want a good laugh at a overly pretentious but unintentionally hilarious film from the 1980's, though, have hit pay dirt. This film definitely packs more laughs than scares, and on that basis I recommend it to aficionados of B-movies everywhere.",1222041600,19,5178,4.646288209606987

292266,5,6300266826,"PRISONERS OF THE LOST UNIVERSE is pretty goofy. Well, okay, it's absolute nonsense! Still, it does have a certain idiot charm. Kay Lenz (from the Made-For-TV movie THE INITIATION OF SARAH) is Carrie Madison, a TV personality who goes to a scientist's home for an interview. On the way there, she runs a poor guy named Dan (Richard Hatch- TV's BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) off the road. They part company and Kay gets to the house, where the scientist has invented a gateway to a parallel universe in his lab. Dan soon arrives on the scene. You can guess the rest, as Kay, the scientist, and Dan accidentally exit this universe and enter a wonky, alternate one! John Saxon (BLACK CHRISTMAS, CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) is a sadistic warlord named Kleel, who, along w/ his army of shirtless male models, seeks for total multi-universal domination. Anyway, there are roaring, bug-eyed natives, a gigantic, helpful caveman, a resourceful green dude, and lots of Ms. Lenz running around in peril!

292313,5,6300266826,"I grew up with Prisoners of the Lost Universe . First viewing was on cable TV about a hundred times , then on VHS , and then DVD . The common denominator being that they all looked and sounded terrible quality wise . I was afraid that this region B (UK) Blu-Ray would be another upconverted disaster . I am extremely happy to say that this Blu-Ray looks really good and is obviously a new HD transfer . The Blu-Ray is region free and 1080P , the PAL DVD that comes with it is not going to play in the Americas so you might as well toss it .

Video quality - The majority of the film is ridiculously detailed and beautiful , colors look natural . When Carrie pulls up in her 280z to Hartman's lab , the detail is so good that you can clearly see the reflection of the film crew in the car's painted mirror . That was not noticeable before this release . Sure, there are still some dark grainy parts that look rough , those have always been in the film , it is not a transfer flaw . The one thing that could have been better , in the final escape scene you still have the three or four redish frames pop up that plagued other releases . But those being left in do not detract from the overall presentation .
Sound quality was also very good , you will not be disappointed .

This film may eventually get a North American Blu release but why wait . It can be purchased directly from AmazonUK for less than 10 pounds which is at the moment $16.69 shipped . Highly recommended for fans of the film .",1470355200,4,1494,4.09556313993174

292350,3,6300266826,"One of the greatest movies of its time.

Waitwhat?  Oh, no, I meant to say that this movie wanted to be one of the greatest movies of its time.  Some over-acting (John Saxons warlord, Kleel, being all manly), some under-acting (leads Richard Hatch, Captain Apollo of the original Battlestar Galactica, and the fetching but generally unfazed Kay Lenz are both guilty), and some outright cheezy acting (Peter OFarrells Lord of the Rings rejected Hobbit thief Malachi is the main offender here) actually add charm to low-budget set pieces in a savage Californian backlot wilderness that had a couple of promising practical effect moments with men in suits as water creatures.  This not-quite-apocalyptic fantasy feature which borrows gladdeningly from The Hidden Fortress and Star Wars storylines follows Carrie, (Lenz, who channels more than a bit of 1970s Farrah Fawcett here if were being honest) a trash TV reporter, who interviews a scientist who says that hes able to transport matter between realities.  As you know, because this takes place in sunny SoCal, an earthquake hits (and hits and hits) just at the right times to knock the scientist, our heroine, and unlucky Dan (Hatch) into another dimension strangely like our own but ruled more or less by a ruthless warlord (Kleel) who keeps everyone in line with his gun (can you guess who provided him with the gun and the gunpowder? Hint: it was the good scientist).  This universe is populated by super strong Neanderthals, thieving guilds, slaves, zombies, weird glowing red-eyed square-headed tribesmen, slithery watermen, and (pre-dating Avatar) super survivor blue shamanic men (okay, apparently he was known as the Greenman but he looked blue on my telly).  Many of these characters must band together to escape from Kleels sadistic fist and, honestly (video quality notwithstanding), this piece of public domain cinema is a hoot to watch despite its many flaws and restricted budget.

292383,3,6300266826,"First, the bad:  the plot is pretty contrived, and Richard Hatch doesn't seem to be giving 100%.  The low budget shows.

The good:  John Saxon always gives good value, and Kay Lenz takes her role seriously.

Analysis (spoilers):  this movie has very much the feel of a Gene Roddenberry TV movie of about 10 years earlier in terms of its wandering narrative and perfunctory sets.  Planet Earth (1973), also with John Saxon, is a good example. Kleel's hastily drawn erotic attraction to Lenz (""your hair is like the sun""-I guess he's never seen a blond woman before) and the plot turning on the jealousy of Kleel's now displaced brunette sex slave are right out of the early 70s palette of character motivations.  Having the scientist transported from the future back Kleel by giving him gunpowder and nitroglycerine also seems like a 70s preoccupation.  Another similarity in this vein is a device not infrequently seen in Star Trek (TOS) of having a single invented exotic plant stick up in the foreground (so close we cannot miss it) to signal alienness in the otherwise normal looking exterior locales.

But you can tell this film is from the early 80s, not only because the FX date it, but because it is less earnest than an early 70s effort in the Roddenberry vein.  The comic relief provided by the-cowardly-opportunist-thief-with-the-heart-of-gold Malachi is ineffective and jarring as the writers use him to complicate the plot by having him betray Richard Hatch repeatedly, and not in a loveable way. Bruce Spence's role as the gyro captain in The Road Warrior (1981), which I think the makers of this film have seen, is a better done example. The film also seems to me to reflect Star Wars (the little glowing-eyed antagonists we see once are reminiscent of Jawas) and the (1977) TV series The Fantastic Journey.

The film is a mix of SF and fantasy.  Indeed, the most effective moment in it is when the ghouls (or spectres of the dead or whatever) pop up out of the earth at the execution site, though they are reduced to furthering the plot by chasing our heroes into the caves under Kleel's compound in an overlong running battle.

In the end, if you have nostalgia for 70s SF tv movies or early 80s sf/fantasy film, or you like the excellent John Saxon in general, you will probably like this film more than my three-star rating suggests.  But if you do not come to this film with these emotions to predispose you, I think you will find three stars too generous.",1391904000,,2475,4.723255813953489
292384,4,6300266826,"4 stars in the B category. Kay Lenz at her best. Richard Hatch is OK. John Saxon even managed a few nuances. Supporting cast was pretty good.
The worst production mistake was to use right-handed drive cars and trucks in what was supposed to be Los Angeles. It was probably made in Hong Kong. The bulk of the movie occurs in an alternate universe with horses and a few new modern inventions of destruction. The main characters are accidentally transported to the alternate universe and the adventure begins.
I believe Kay Lenz is actually sexier in this than the movie where she she is an undercover cop stripping (Stripped to Kill or something like that). Of course she doesn't strip in this one.

Don't recall seeing much of any of the actors in this movie later on. Perhaps they were too embarrassed to continue with such a career. But, it did pass some time waiting for my dinner to finish being prepared. I guess there is a silver lining to everything.",1385683200,,364,4.2898550724637685

BUT if your looking for a movie that has sword fighting, time travel, buff bar man that pulls his teeth with a pair of pliars and a Cameo of the creature from the black lagoon.... This is your movie. I found this movie about 29years ago on VHS in a player I bought from goodwill...... I was scared at first bc you know it could have been a porno but I took a chance and watched it. Low and be hold my life changed forever. The movie really is good if you get past the corky graphics and sub parts acting. Malikie is my favorite character/comedic relief. The main villain is a low quality Sean Connorey but he does the job. I highly recommend this movie with every bone in my body bc it will change your life forever...... 5 stars",1508630400,,860,4.218181818181818

On the plus side, this is no Frankenstein Island. There is some decent acting with actually appealing actors. Richard Hatch was always underutilized but certainly is appealing here. John Saxon is in full John Saxon mode and plays his evil character halfway between Donald Pleasance and Kurtwood Smith.  As others certainly have pointed out the real find is Kay Lenz. Well find is a bit of a stretch. She played a hippy chick intertwined with William Holden in the Clint Eastwood lensed Breezy. Having recently watched that film for the first time it is well worth the look and she is fantastic in it. She was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance (Best New Actress nominee). Kay Lenz is fantastic in her role with great chemistry with Richard Hatch and a sense of spunky fun.

The movie also has some decent ideas wrapped up with some on the spot dialogue.  So why am I watching this movie with a Rifftrax soundtrack and comparing it to Frankenstein Island?  Well. Did I mentioned it was filmed in South Africa in the early Eighties and they used their entire budget for top name stars like Richard Hatch? Yes, this one had potential but everything else is a pure train wreck. You cant make Lord of the Rings on a 100k budget. It is a combination of LARPers gone wrong and some of the worst, yet strangely creative costumes and makeup ever seen. You have giants, midgets, green people and sets that would make 60s Star Trek blush.

Its all in good fun and the stars mentioned above make most of this more palatable than it should be. For those times even the charms of Richard Hatch or John Saxon cannot win one over I had the soothing jokes of Rifftrax to see me through. An okay time but don't be surprised if you are confused after fifteen minutes and asleep after forty-five.",1493164800,,1997,4.57703081232493
