7794917,1,0979910013,For the price I paid I expected something professional. I was very disappointed with this DVD. The quality is poor and the workout was lame. Definitely not intended for someone who works out regularly. It looks like it was filmed in someones house with a home video camera. The sound quality is poor. I didn't even break a sweat. I wold not recommend this for any woman who works out on a regular basis!,1419638400,,403,4.45945945945946
7794918,5,0979910013,"I am pregnant with my third child and have many prenatal workout DVDs. The sections on this DVD are long enough to work on their own as a workout, but short enough to combine if I want a longer workout. The chair strength and regular strength workouts are both about 28 minutes, the flexibility segment is almost 30 minutes. The strength workout uses a band, but I used 5 lb weight because I don't like to use bands much. It worked fine for me. The flexibility segement had enough movement to get me warm while doing it as well. I prefer that to some of the prenatal workouts that I nearly fall asleep doing. With two other kids already, I don't have time to spend ten minutes of my workout time just breathing deeply.",1392076800,,718,4.365671641791045
