However, I would NOT have purchased it if I had known how poor the English subtitles were. Because I have already watched the full drama and knew what the story was about, I am able to follow along. However, for someone who has never watched the drama before...the subtitles in this DVD are just awkward and weird. I'd have to say the subtitles are something you'd get by using Google translate..not totally reliable. The picture quality of the DVD also isn't the greatest and I do regret purchasing it. I am only keeping it because I really love Matsuda Shota, and because I am studying Japanese and hope to be able to re-watch it in the future without subs. *also I feel as though the prior reviewer was not being honest by saying ""the subtitles are also very clear and accurate""...completely untrue and waste of 50 bucks for me.",1473552000,,979,4.4748603351955305
8490553,5,B0060MFW3C,"The quality of the DVD is good, the subtitles are also very clear and accurate. The show itself is very warm and sweet with comedy thrown in. Shota Matusda is very funny and sweet in this role. Overall it's a good buy. Well worth it.",1456617600,,233,4.2
8490554,5,B0060MFW3C,"OK, so the premise is the switching of bodies of opposite types: a dorky but kind, a bit ineffective child care worker (young, handsome) and a tough, strong, yakuza boss (middle-aged, bald). Now, they have to cooperate in order to keep up their lives and until they figure out how to switch back. Of course, funny stuff ensues as the Yakuza does the child-care stuff and the weak-vegetarian guy has to hang out with the yakuza' wife and henchmen. It's touching, too, as we see them try to rescue and heljp children in bad situations (where sometimes the menace approach of the yakuza is needed). The ending felt a tad rushed, but the actors did a fine job and the secondary stories were good. Hubby and I both enjoyed this so much, we marathon-watched it during a weekend. And for Shota Matsuda fans--me!!!--he's gorgeous and funny here.",1385424000,,837,4.700680272108843
