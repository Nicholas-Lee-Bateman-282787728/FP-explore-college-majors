7799929,3,1598032909,"There's a lot to consider in this course.....much more to fantasy/science fiction than I ever imagined.  But some of the material seems to be forced into the lecturer's mindset and not that likely in actuality.

Much of the presentation is confused...a lot of jumping around....disorganized within each lecture.  And the lecturer is obviously reading from teleprompters...and stumbling....and misprounouncing.  I spent most of the time looking past my screen because the delivery was annoying to watch.",1364515200,,502,5.653333333333333
