8174249,4,B000BKVS8C,"I ordered both Vacaciones de Terror 1 and 2, but the distributers did not include on the box from the part 2 that it includes both ver5sions, so now I have one extra part 1, thank god I ordered them from the same seller, so I did not pay two shipments, but it's ok it was enterprises' matter not seller's mistake. Even though I am happy I received them on time and good shape (One box was broken but not from seller but from factory, so they are brand new).
But I recommend these movies, they're just great!",1307923200,,507,4.183673469387755
