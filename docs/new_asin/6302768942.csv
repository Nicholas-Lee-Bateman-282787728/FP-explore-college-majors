509563,4,6302768942,"I have to say, i read the reviews before i purchased this video and was torn as to whether or not purchase it.  However, for the price of 25 cents for a used one, or 82 cents for a new one, i figured i couldn't go wrong.
This tape starts out with about a 5 minute intro to the basic moves and how to perform them correctly to achieve results.  Then it moves into about a 5 minute warmup, about a 15 minute workout and then a 5 minute stretch. Overall, this is a good workout lenght for those days you don't have time to spare.
There are 5 workouts on this tape. These moves are the same ones that are found on 8 Minute Buns and other more modern and up-to-date tapes. These moves are effective and timeless.  Although Tony is in need of a haircut, he's overly enthusiastic, and he has alot of funny sayings and beliefs, this tape is a good one. You can even put on music, mute the tape and work along with it easily because of the simplicity of the moves and the counter on the bottom.
While doing each workout, there is a timeline on the bottom in which you can time how long you do the workout.  If u can not finish the full time length of the workout, you can monitor and stop each movement at a certain time.  Another good feature is that during each workout there is a box in the top right corner that pops up to let you know how an advanced exerciser can vary the workout to their ability.
Bottom Line- for the price of 25-82 cents, you get more than you money's worth.  Buy them Up!",1047600000,7,1489,4.099656357388316

7830904,4,6302768942,"The Tape was not to bad but was a VCR tape, it is a old video but still good to workout with. Some people believe you can just exercise and not eat to much and stay at your target weight and helps with building mussels this video also helps with the other two tapes he made it helps with different mussel exercises for people that have back problems. Used this to change out the exercises of the other two tapes Tony made. A great way to tone up no matter what your age.",1386288000,,470,4.064516129032258
