2061091,1,B000244GOK,"This is by far the worst horror, no, movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I have seen many, many movies in my time.  This is slow moving, boring, no dialogue and sad.  The villian whomever that may be is sadly portrayed.
I couldn't even watch this whole movie, after 30 minutes of 15-words, 3 characters and no plot, I shut this movie off.  Bad acting.
This movie isn't cheesy, it's just really, really bad.  It offers NOTHING to the horror genre, nor to the movie genre for that matter.  There is no reason for you to waste your time or money on this garbage.  If you like horror movies, watch something more worth while such as Hellraiser or Night of the Living Dead because this is the lamest of the lame.
0 stars, nada, zip, nilch ... seriously, if you like crap - get this.  I'm so glad I got this DVD for free from HMV or else I'd be scavenging for the receit.
My 16-year old brother says:  'This movie stinks, it's the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  It sucks royale, next time I want to blow chunks - I'll pop this garbage into my DVD player.  Save us ALL if this is the future of the horror genre!  If you have any thoughts of renting or buying this, you'd be better off shooting yourself!'",1089676800,5,1217,4.1581196581196584
2061132,3,B000244GOK,"Douglas Schulze's film is filled with eerie imagery, a sense of foreboding and doom, and is also vague and indifferent.  Jon Bennett stars as cop Gabriel Goodman, who awakens one day and finds that he may be a survivor of the Apocalypse.  Of course, courtesy of the kinetically charged flashbacks, we realize it's something a little more personal.  Ever since TWILIGHT ZONE did an episode about the final dying moments; ever since CARNIVAL OF SOULS gave us a woman who was reliving a bizarre existence as she lay dying in her submerged car, moviemakers have been fascinated with what might go on in those last moments of life.  DARK HEAVEN is to be commended for its probing of the idea of faith; grief; loss; and just what might lie on the other side.  The problem is the script is so loose-ended, by the time we reach the inevitable conclusion, it has never really committed itself to what it believes, let alone what they want us to believe.  Bennett does fairly well, considering he has to carry the whole film, but he doesn't have the star power to be utterly convincing, but we still feel sorry for him, knowing what led him to his own personal Armageddon.  Visually interesting, with much potential, not fully realized.",1116633600,,1226,4.700934579439252

2061134,4,B000244GOK,"I enjoyed the movie because of the simple special effects. If you aren't aware of the Book of revelations then this is just another story for you.

One thing I would like to add and it's a comment to the reviewer who said that he had to sit through another 70 minutes of a horrible film.  If you don't like a movie, then use your stop button and take the movie out.  If you don't do that, don't complain.",1106956800,2,404,4.0886075949367084
2061135,1,B000244GOK,"This is the second worst wanna-be Jacob's Ladder movie I've ever seen, the worst being ""13 Seconds"". It went through so many obvious plot contrivances that I knew how it was going to end when I was only twenty minutes in - and then I had to sit through another 70 minutes.

It's unfortunate that the movie had a muddled script and a bad story because the cinematography was pretty good, and the first few minutes of the movie showed promise. I just wish that I knew why everyone is suddenly making these third-rate ""I'm dead but I don't know it"" movies. It's becoming a whole sub-genre of thriller movies now. It's probably some kind of M. Night Shyamalan backlash. One star for you.",1106956800,4,683,4.508064516129032
2061136,5,B000244GOK,"I've been reading all these love/hate reviews of DARK HEAVEN and it stands to reason that filmmaker Doug Schulze has succeeded at making a rather controversial little film. So, I went out and rented it for myself. I now understand what all the fuss is about. I, myself, loved it. I gave it 5 stars. I am bored stiff by what I am seeing in the theatres today. Have you seen SAW? Yuck! Yet more ""in your face"" Japan filmmaking. I think that the future of horror is with films like DARK HEAVEN that strive to unsettle the viewer and leave them feeling ""violated"". Kind of like Rosemary's Baby. I'll be purchasing  a copy of the film for my own library. Although DARK HEAVEN isn't perfect it certainly deserves its place amoung other effective thrillers like ""Jacob's Ladder, Devil's Advocate etc...DEFINITELY CHECK IT OUT.

BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO has seen fit to give DARK HEAVEN a very strong release. The 10 copies in my store have rented a record number of times. I read on the web that this is one of THINKFILM'S most successful titles. I can easily see why. The mood is infectious. It's extreme creepy and disturbing in an ethereal way.

To my surprise most of the reviews here have been nearly word for word cut and pastes of the reviews on that website. The reviewer who mentioned that they must be acquiantances hit it dead on, I think, for many of the reviews.

The movie sounded really cool on the box. If my expectations were a neck-deep pool, there wouldn't be a molecule of water present.

This was shoddy workmanship. Poorly executed acting, scriptwriting and effects. I feel bad for anyone who's name is associated with this movie, or who, like me, wasted $3.50 renting it. I want my time and money back.

2061139,5,B000244GOK,"As a film major from GVSU, I dreamed of making movies since I saw ""Jaws"" at 8 years old.  Since then, I've watched a lot of horror movies and really look out for the obscure titles and any old ""70's"" occult horror.  I was truly surprised by this one.  ""DH"" starts out with a real feel of a retro 1970's style movie (any ""Omega Man"" or ""Preceint 13"" fans out there?)then does a 180 and turns into this nightmarish ""David Lynch"" style movie. I was a bit surprised by the ending, but I guess there some deep catholic themes to the film that I might not have picked up on (hey, I'm presbyterian).  Look, we've all seen those cheezy low-budget horror titles with bad acting that look like they were intentionally shot for late-night TV.  I gotta admit, this isn't one of them.  I really dug it!

 and some other limitations but the filmmakers were successful in delivering their message despite these restrictions.

 Additionally the visual storytelling style of the filmmakers was quite exceptional.

 I could easily find more flaws in M. Night Shamylan's ""The Village"" which was poorly paced and failed to deliver what I was

 expecting. Save your $ 10 and rent this film instead. Or better yet buy a copy. The director commentary is interesting and gives some insight into the filmmaker's reasoning behind this story.",1091491200,,655,5.230769230769231

It reminded me of THE QUIET EARTH? Also a good movie. Not for everyone but I DO THINK it was alot like the Twilight Zones.

It's kinda like 28Dayz Later with the emtpy city but not scarey. It made me think and I haven't thought much after watching a movie, lately.

I recommend it! I also hope I go to heaven!",1091059200,,497,4.051020408163265
2061153,1,B000244GOK,"Okay, I just watched this amateurishly produced and directed turkey. Do the other reviewers who are praising this film on Amazon have a personal acquaintanceship with the producers? I don't know. But, if we all watched the same film, then how could they rate this direct-to-video production highly? Especially when this disc features a lead actor with the worst line delivery this side of a Madonna film. Go figure!

 Do you like your horror-fantasy films filled with flashing, pulsating bright white lights and smoke? I am talking about 88 minutes worth, done over and over, ad nauseum! How about slow motion effects done to a point where you just want to fast forward? Only then, you manage to find still more redundacies, as the people responsible for this dreck continue to employ the same tired effects. Lastly, how about no comprehensible story line development, short of inane plot turns all taking place on poorly conceived movie sets?

 Folks, I like good, well-told, end-of-life films with Twilight Zone touches as much or more than the next guy. I also routinely cut low budget movies made with a modicum of talent all kinds of slack. But this movie is a waste of the aluminum used for DVDs. Steer clear. You have been warned.

2061154,5,B000244GOK,"Knowing that I'm no filmmaker and will never accomplish my own feature, I will chose my words wisely. AWESOME. TOTALLY ORIGINAL.

 ENGAGING. THOUGHT PROVOKING. These are words, phrases I use to describe DARK HEAVEN.

 The story seems inspired by Ambrose Bierce's Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge and Jacob's Ladder. Overall the film is visually stunning. Kudos to the clever compositions chosen by the director. Despite uneven lighting and several cinematographers Schulze manages an overall errie mood reminicent of his classic 1992 HELLMASTER that starred screen veteran JOHN SAXON (soon to be rereleased on dvd).

 Dark Heaven makes you THINK and also ENTERTAINS. A few moments are repetative but it appears as if some of Schulze's intentions were not fully realizable by what is clearly a mostly freshman cast and crew.

 Haunting memories of a life lost plague city cop Gabriel Goodman on his first day back on the beat after sick leave. We will soon come to learn he's suicidal. But before the story can fall into a predictable pattern, Gabe finds himself alone in a city. Like the Omega Man Gabe appears to be the LAST MAN ON EARTH. What follows is nothing short of CREEPY.

 The dvd box art is a bit decieving though. It's not what you call traditional horror. It's more like Roman Polanski horror ala Rosemary's Baby. Or, Jacob's Ladder.

 CHECK THIS FILM OUT FOR SURE.

2061155,3,B000244GOK,"In 1992, a little-known horror film, called Hell Master, premiered on HBO and Cinemax.  It co-starred b-movie legend John Saxton, and was entirely shot in Michigan; the film screamed stinker in every sense of the word.  Abysmal acting and stiff, uninspired writing mired the first attempt at a feature film, directed by Doug Schulze and produced by partner Kurt Mayry: my film instructors.

It takes guts to go out, write a film, and actually see it come to fruition, and by all means, they deserve credit for that.  A mad professor creates a drug capable of transforming humans into experimental mutations.  The idea has been done countless times over.  On top of that, as is tradition for most filmmakers, it was shot on 35mm film on a shoe-string budget; the lackluster lighting makes it look like it was shot on video.

Over a decade later, the same team partnered up and finished Dark Heaven; all I can say after a screening in Detroit is: what a hell of an improvement.

The main character, Gabriel, wakes up in an apocalyptic city, in which any sign of life appears to be absent from a bloody scene.  Police cars, their sirens ablaze, litter the Detroit streets, as Gabriel hunts down a sole, caped survivor.  He eventually gets caught up in his own personal crusade, as he desperately strives to solve the mystery.

The first twenty minutes are what really sets up the rest of the plot, as Gabriel goes from a deserted restaurant, to city streets, to a secluded prison bus, and finally to an abandoned sanctuary, all of which build on the eerie atmoshpere.  After that, the story goes on a clueless whirlwind of befuddled events, drawing back to his fateful personal life, and then returning him to a salvage monolith; the film does this several times, adding a few characters into the mix, and exceeding its visual boundaries every step of the way.

When Doug and Kurt took their film to Sundance in winter of 2002, several of their students got to see a first glimpse of the film.  They came back and made it abundantly clear that it was one of the worst films presented at the festival.  I'm wondering if they saw the same film, or if it was modified since then, as there really isn't anything negative about it.  Maybe I went in expecting low expectations, because I came out  impressed.  From the get-go, it's obvious that the film, in its craft, is purely artistic.  There is no one term to describe the type of movie this is: essentially, it's a gothic psychological thriller with a heavy catholic twist.  It's visually impressive, so kudos to the cinematography team for a great job.  There are a few shots that are more shaky than necessary, and one or two scenes that were greatly underexposed; but the atmosphere and the lighting added a lot.  The music wasn't brilliant, but deserves mentioning, as it kept the suspense going, and was creatively composed.  On top of that, the sound deserves some sort of independent award.  The costumes were inventive, to say the least, if not a little stiff.  However, kudos to the filmmakers in acquiring Chris Walas, the same person who designed the costumes for Gremlins and The Fly, to design the angels.

Story-wise, it left a little to be desired.  Once it went inside the sanctuary, scenes were all over the place, and it was hard to keep track of where the character was, and where the story was going.  Even with that in mind, little was predictable.

If anything, the film proved to be an ambitious effort that amazes with a unique visual style.  I would go as far to say that it is in many ways a low-budget, sacreligious version of The Sixth Sense.  With all the pinholes in the story, it deserves a second watch.  I'm just surprised you guys didn't go a little further with the distribution; it would've been interesting to see how it would have faired in theaters.  You guys have come a long way since Hell Master.  Keep making those movies better and better.

P.S.: And Kurt's getting married.",1090713600,,3964,4.662824207492795
2061156,5,B000244GOK,"Bravo to filmmaker Douglas Schulze for making such a fascinating indy feature. Although it's really not a ""horror"" film in the traditional sense, DARK HEAVEN is more of a drama.
In retrospect the story is extremely familiar but it's how director Schulze decides to tell the story that makes it so interesting to watch.
Clearly lower budgeted but more satisfying than I-Robot or that lame Vin Diesel sci-fi flick.

The movie looked extremely low budgeted and the acting was absolutely horrendous (well for the little acting that was required in the piece of crap).  The movie was extremely repetitive and the storyline was out of control!  Extremely hard to follow since there is no background info on any of the characters.

8021715,1,B000244GOK,"One of the benefits to the BlockBuster mail order program is I'm willing to add movies to by queue that I otherwise would not.  Sometimes this works (""Ever Since the World Ended"", ""The Quiet Earth""), and sometimes this does not.

The best thing I can say about this horrible movie is that it's not the worst I've seen  (That honor goes to ""Zombie Night,"" which looks like it was shot by a high-school film class.  In one day.  In 1963.)  However, ""Dark Heaven"" has to be singled out because it tries harder to be a bad movie.

Does the premise of this movie make you think (as one 5-star reviewer said)?  No.  It makes you yawn.  The ""big-unexpected-twist-ending"" was pretty clear five minutes into the movie.  Granted, this movie did this ending a couple years before it was done in ""Stay.""  But, it's not like it was original then, either.  Yawn.

I'm not opposed to budget films.  But everything about this (except the film quality) was so badly done.  Bad acting?  Check.  (Note, if an entire movie focuses around a single character on screen, then get a decent actor for that character.  I felt plenty of emotional anguish from the performance, but not as empathy for the character.)  Bad effects?  Oh yeah.  (""Hey, I got it!  Let's light this hamburger on fire!""  ""Ohhh...  I just realized!  We can invert the color!  Nobody does that anymore!"")  Bad sound?  Oh, heck yeah.  Most of the dialog doesn't seem to synch up right to the actors.  I can see their lips move, and can tell they're speaking English, but it's just not exactly in synch with the sound.  And the DVD sound is atrocious.  I had to turn the sound up 200% from the normal to hear what was being said.  After trying to figure out what was being said, I finally went to turn on the Closed Captioning, but this DVD doesn't have any.  Heh.

Well, a movie can overcome some poor production values if it has a good plot, right?  Yeah, well...  It is almost as if the script was being written while the movie was in production and the original intent was to make another movie altogether.  Near the beginning of the movie, the main character ""wakes up"" in a world that appears to be empty.  Later on, he has a flashback where he recalls a totally different scenario of the world disappearing!  The characterizations are so convoluted that they are humorous.  (There is a scene where the main character is walking down a hallway to the bleeding body of his wife.  Yep, ""walking.""  ""Hey, Hon!  No, don't get up.  I'll go get there eventually."")  There are several other scenes where mysterious hooded figures reach out for him and each time he is rendered unconscious.  But he never tries to get away from them, and actively follows them for much of the movie!

Spoiler Warning:  Now, I know the premise was that this whole mess was an as-I-lay-dying dream, but if you are going to go this route, there is a rule that has to be followed:  All action has to be centered around the dreaming character!  So, starting the movie with a scene with the (imaginary!) antagonist having his congregation disappear just doesn't make any sense.

When this awful movie finally ended, the credits began with ""Written, Produced, and Directed by Douglas Schulze"".  I chucked and thought, ""I wouldn't advertise that, if I were him.""",1211846400,,3280,4.602430555555555

Unfortunately the weak acting, bad cinematography (you could see parts of the camera,) and over use of film school effects like slow motion, red lights, and smoke, did a pretty good job of ruining any potential this movie had.

There is a big angel fight scene towards the end that was just pathetic. I think the problem stems from the costumes restricting the movements of the actors so much, they were only able to weave back and forth at each other. You really only know that it's a fight scene by the music and the context; otherwise you might think they were trying to waltz in full body casts.

I can't recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought provoking horror film. I can recommend it, if you want to see just how bad a movie can be, which might give you some appreciation of how much effort is involved in making good movies. So maybe it is thought provoking after all.",1119657600,5,1250,4.417391304347826
8021724,1,B000244GOK,"I usually like these kinds of 'end of the world' type movies, but this movie was so bad I was getting angry.  I watched the whole thing, hoping it would get better, but I ended up wasting those precious 90 minutes of my life, and I want them back!

This movie had no comprehensible ideas or storyline, the effects and locations were crap, the acting amateur.  I've seen student films that were far superior to this.

If you want to be offended by bad moviemaking, get this movie.  Otherwise, stay away.  How did it even get into videostores?",1116806400,3,541,4.469387755102041
