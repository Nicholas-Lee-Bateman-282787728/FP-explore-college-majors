8323905,5,B00004RUL8,"I saw this film several times - it stayed in a movie theatre in Zurich for years. It shows how life offers chances to develop, in the second half of our lives, what we haven't done in the first part. The role of the feminine, its importance, for every man, no matter what his choices in life were. A sensitive, intelligent, original movie. Excellent cast.",1164758400,2,355,4.476923076923077
8323906,5,B00004RUL8,"This is indeed an exceptional film - despite the filming camera obviously being hand-held for some shots - it doesn't distract from the content at all.

My wife and I found the film an enthralling yet simple story about a monk, once sworn to silence, receiving permission to speak, and briefly rejoin society to save their monestary in Switzerland because the lease is about to expire.

A classic case of content defeating special effects, violence and crude behavior.  If you're serious about assembling a good video library, this film would be a component.  I can't believe it's not in the Criterion collection and on DVD.",1145836800,4,624,4.914285714285715
