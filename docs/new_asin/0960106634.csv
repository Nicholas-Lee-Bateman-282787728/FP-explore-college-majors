7793648,5,0960106634,The best stretching video I have ever used.  It's not too aggressive but it's enough to stretch your body before you do your workout.  I have been using this video for years and it has helped me continue to stay in the best shape of my life.,1452816000,,241,4.1063829787234045

7793650,4,0960106634,I am a physician and interested in preventative care.  I think stretching by Anderson is full of good advice for us ordinary folk to maintain good flexibility.  The exercises are simple and easy to do.  Anderson is the expert on this poorly understood part of exercise. This is a must video for any one serious in staying in good shape. It is not a workout video. Anderson thoroughly explains each stretch.  I will probably use most of the exercises he demonstrated. I was pleasantly suprised how much care he put into stretch and massage of the feet.,1004400000,,551,4.649484536082475
7793651,1,0960106634,"I'm a 4th gup in Tang Soo Do and was looking for some help in the stretching area.  This video did not come through.  The instructor does an excellent job of walking you through lots of different stretches and the  proper technique and then falls extremely short on the actual application  part.  His ""daily stretching routine"" was nothing more than what  I learned from my P.E. coach in junior high.",947203200,73,400,4.642857142857143
