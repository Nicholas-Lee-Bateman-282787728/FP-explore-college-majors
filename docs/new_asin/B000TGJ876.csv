8209220,5,B000TGJ876,So very happy to find this. Even more happy to see who the stars were. I worked on this tour and never knew this existed.,1483833600,,121,3.88
8209221,1,B000TGJ876,Our Granddaughter loves to watch ice skating....this is a live taping that is low quality.....we watch it but doesn't hold her interest for long.  Would not purchase again,1436572800,,171,5.107142857142857

8209225,3,B000TGJ876,"Photography seems poor - colors faded, shot at poor angles.  Seems to be heavily edited - more like ""Highlights from Nutcracker on Ice""  than a complete program.  Other version of ""Nutcracker on Ice"" with Oksana Baiul MUCH better done technically and artistically - unfortunately, not available (apparently) on DVD but only on VHS.",1386892800,,331,5.2075471698113205
8209226,5,B000TGJ876,It was just fantastic to see the old skaters.  They were all the greats of that day.  They will always be the best,1362441600,,114,3.9130434782608696
8209227,1,B000TGJ876,"It was faded out almost to not being viewable. Apparently it was made from an old VHS from a TV special. It was not 60 minutes long,, but rather maybe 35 and there was no continuity to it. It had ""station breaks"" (probably 5 or 6) in that short amount of time. We DO NOT BLAME SELLER. There is no way seller would know unless they had viewed it.",1356566400,,345,4.0144927536231885
8209228,3,B000TGJ876,"The skaters, costumers and set designers have done a nice job, but I found the video unsatisfying.  The orchestral sound is muffled.  The narrative opening and breaks are too short.  The principal skaters have their credit put on screen as they appear, instead of just in the titles or the credits, which by the way use an aged film technique that is unnecessary.  There is generally too much close camera work, angled shots and quick edits that become distracting with dancing or skating.  And finally, the videotape session was edited for time, and formated with commercial breaks.  This might be an o.k. watch for little ones with limited attention spans, but fans of the Nutcracker may find it wanting.",1325894400,2,706,4.890756302521009
8209229,4,B000TGJ876,"Overall, I enjoyed this dvd very much. Beautiful skating and choreography along with the wonderful skating skills of Tai Babilonia,Randy Gardner and Linda Fratianne gave new life to a wonderful classic. I would recommend this dvd.",1296000000,3,230,5.416666666666667
