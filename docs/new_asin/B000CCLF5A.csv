There are too many dark scenes in this movie that make it hard to follow the story. It seems like a simplified or condensed version of the famous 19th century novel. Since I never read the book I cant comment on what is missing or changed from the novel. The Bonus Materials tell about Alexander Dumas life and career. This is just an interesting as the movie. The scriptwriter said this version is different from the book. This movie was filmed in Malta, which hasn't changed much since the 19th century. Sailing ships were imported from England. Filming was done at night to avoid unwanted details.",1487721600,,2880,4.708333333333333
