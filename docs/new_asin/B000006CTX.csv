7904069,2,B000006CTX,"There are so many things that are messed up with this DVD that one really has to go through a list of all the things that can go wrong with a movie, especially one that is transfered from another language like Spanish to English.
This DVD was viciated thoroughly, first of all, because of the aweful syncronization effort.  You can actually see how the lips of the actors are moving but for a slight moment no words are heard from them!  In the beginning of this movie its really terrible, simply cause its so obvious.
Then there is the picture quality, although the movie is from 1993 it looks as if it had been filmed in the late 1970s (no joke), or at least my Malaysian version of it.  Needless to say that is totally unacceptable.
Then there's the story, or what claims to be a story.  I mean, who came up with this unbelievably lame story?  Antonio Banderas dosen't look believable as the love sick man chasing a circus women around that he just met.  But far worse is the behavior of this women, who goes on a killing spree that simply defies any logic.  Especially the scene where she kills two cops feels absolutely contrived.  When it comes to acting, its really only Banderas that manages to hold this botched mess together, and from witnessing a total desaster.
In the end, you're better off skipping this one.  As others have indicated this movie was probably much better in the original Spanish version, without the rediculous synchronization efforts that failed virtually at every lame attempt.",1259107200,,1509,4.642857142857143

I have the original Spanish language VHS, and no English language dubbing can do justice to the original Spanish version. Why even change the name? ""Shoot!"" has so much subtext. She's a sharpshooter to begin with. She goes after the men who raped her with her rifle... It nakes so much sense to call it ""Shoot!"". Antonio Banderas - pre-movie star - is so good, here, as an earnest reporter. He is stuck in the predicament of falling in love with a circus performer who will move on. The real star is Francesca Neri, the Italian actress who seems to do her own riding and shooting. Everything about this movie looks authentic, including the brutal rape and murder scenes. If you are looking for a happy Hollywood ending, go elsewhere. These characters are doomed from the first ""shot"". -Sheshetta",1227830400,2,1009,5.558441558441558
7904071,1,B000006CTX,"After getting several notices that the movie had been delayed, but would ship eventually...I decided to cancel the order.  I waited months on it.

I suggest Amazon taking this movie off their list, since they don't have it, nor can they get it.",1167955200,,244,4.651162790697675
7904072,3,B000006CTX,"The story follows Ana (played wonderfully by the beautiful Francesca Neri) as a sharp shooter performing in the circus. She falls in love with a journalist named Marcos (Antonio Banderas). After a brutal rape and several murders later, she finds herself on the run with Marcos chasing after her.

The DVD story would have you believe that this is a typical Rape/ Revenge flick where the rape occurs early on and the rest of the film is the woman seeking vengeance. But the rape doesn't occur until 40 minutes in giving the viewers plenty of time to get to know Ana and like her character. She looks like Rachel Weisz and is quite impulsive and quirky. Her character is very likable and you will find her emotionally honest even when she is lying. This will make watching her downfall a little difficult to bear.

You watch Ana fall in love with Marcos, make love with him, and then you see the excitement in her eyes when she runs to her door one fateful night expecting Marcos on the other side. The gang rape is brutal, but most of the violence (outside of the rape) is implied. The revenge part takes place very soon after. The rest of the film is Ana and Marcos trying to reach each other one last time, making several mistakes along the way, and a very climactic reunion at the end.

Where the story veers into stupidity, is when Marcos sees the news story of the rapists murders, assumes Ana is the killer without even speaking to her, and then proceeds to rat on her instantly. That amore'. Soon after, Ana visits a doctor for her excessive bleeding (ahem, vaginal, due to the ""bottle assault""), the doctor immediately calls the police on her the moment Ana leaves the room. Rape Advocacy, yeah! And get this...the doctor then goes on the radio giving the victims name and detailing her vaginal wounds! Ethics? We don't need no stinking Ethics!

Ultimately, this film is incredibly depressing and bleak. The ending will not make you feel any better about what transpired before hand. The victim gets no justice and she is punished for being victimized. A cop even refers to her as ""the bitch.""

Favorite Quote: ""I said I'd follow you to Hell, well, here I am,"" spoken by Marcos to Ana after he finally catches up to her at the end.

DVD Extras: Scene Selection and brief Film Facts. There is an Italian and English dubbed version. The dubbed version is terrible and takes away from the atmosphere. Plus, I know what Antonio Banderas sounds like and I can assure you that was not it.

Bottom Line: Very dreary film with not much to recommend here except Francesca Neri's great performance.

Rating: 6/10

7904073,5,B000006CTX,"I saw this film in Spanish-language VHS format with English subtitles.  My experience with dubbed foreign films has been uniformly bad, and I avoid them like the plague.  Dubbing ALWAYS makes a film worse, without exception, and no matter what the language.

I enjoy Saura's Flamenco films, and so was curious about what a Saura ""action"" film would look like.  The fact that Antonio Banderas appears in it was a side issue for me.  It was made before he made the Hollywood big-time, and was still  trying to be a serious actor.  He is actually quite good as the idealistic but jaded young newspaperman.

It is a curious film, not what I expected.  Although it was made in 1997, and has televisions, computers, and cell phones in it, it reminded me of the bleak French and Italian films of the '40's and '50's, after WWII, before Europe became prosperous again.  It has a distinctly unmodern, pessimistic atmosphere.  The setting of the circus, and the character of a trick rider recall the 19th century.  Anna, the rider/shooter, is clearly not at home in the contemporary world, seems to be caught in a time warp, and lives according to her own, pre-modern rules.  The circus life has much in common with the gypsy life portrayed in Saura's flamenco films, and much of the flamenco ""duende"".  (Note:  The character Anna is the daughter of circus people, trapeze artists, from Bolzano, in the Alto Adige region of northern Italy, which accounts for her German surname.  She is joking with Marcos when she says her mother was a Russian countess.  Anna speaks Spanish with an Italian accent.)

The story is a revenge tragedy, a very old dramatic form, in a modern setting.  But Saura, perhaps because he is Spanish, and has submerged himself in pre-modern gypsy culture, manages to avoid modern cliches while using this ancient form.

Her brief love affair with Marcos, the young reporter, is interrupted when she is raped by three young thugs, in one of the most brutally filmed scenes I have ever seen.  Saura doesn't clean it up at all.  You really want her to kill these vermin afterward.

A woman of Anna's accomplishments and character clearly isn't going to rest until her assailants have been punished.  But this is a tragedy, not really an ""action"" film after all.  Her killings of the rapist thugs are convincing in their ugliness, but her revenge is not sweet.  It only makes her position more desperate, speeding her inexorable descent into hell.  In the end, Saura makes us believe that Anna, guilty as she is, had her reasons, and that her death frees her of her sins.

The melancholy music adds to the bitter-sweet mood of the film.

The acting by Banderas and Neri is first rate.  One believes that they are desperately in love, and that it would have ended badly regardless.  In spite of the brutality, it is a romantic film, in the 19th century sense of the term.

It looks to me as though Neri did much of her own riding and shooting.  The cinematography is quite good, Italianate, and Madrid has the look of a city lived in, not a movie set.

To make a DVD of a film like this in dubbed English only is complete philistinism, verging on the criminal.

Highly recommended in its original Spanish-language form.  Even if you speak only a little Spanish, you will realize that the subtitles, even though they are pretty good, don't capture the profanity.  There's no point watching it dubbed in English.",1111881600,15,3418,4.712837837837838
7904074,2,B000006CTX,"Technical screw-ups with DVD aside, this film is OK.  It certainly bears lesser artistic value than other films from Carlso Saura. But, it is not worse than some of the rubbish that come outs.  It is just, probably, one  of those cases, when an artist needed money and so on...
The story is  somewhat weak and superficial. I was drawn into it for the first 20-25  minutes.  I expected something really interesting to happen. It did  not...
It is a story of a young journalist, Banderas, who needs to cover  a story [for reasons, I honestly can not remember] about the circus, which  came to town.
Naturally, he falls in love with the beautiful horse-riding  circus girl.
From that point on, it gest worse...
It turns out that  the girl is half-Russian, half-Italian, half-God-knows what else. She is  very bright and intelligent, inspite of her being a circus artist [feel the  social message here]: she seems to be speaking all the languages she knows  at once.
They end up having  a little bit of sex [at least on screen],  then, she is raped, and then, what?... oh, yeah, she gets revenge and he  gets... nothing.
And you are left in an OUTRAGE: Could the plot be any  more lame than this? Hardly...",960422400,11,1202,4.589622641509434
