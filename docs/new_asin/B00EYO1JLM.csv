8610355,2,B00EYO1JLM,"Disappointed. Normally I like Alain Burrese's videos, but in this one, he just shows a bunch of basic techniques. Hardly any set-ups nor entries nor flows from one submission to another. Just the very basics of each technique itself. Good for White Belts, but that's about it. I'm probably sending this expensive video back.",1495756800,,324,5.018518518518518
8610356,5,B00EYO1JLM,"Alain once again does a fine job blending the nuances of theory and showing practical execution. This video has been in my library for a while and it takes a top position for when my students ask about chokes.

Serious consideration should be give to any of the videos Alain produces and this one ranks near the top of the list.",1444694400,3,328,4.377049180327869
8610357,1,B00EYO1JLM,lol I just think its funny for a supposed master to have a guy in an improper choke hold on the cover of the dvd. Next time consider using your forearm to cut off the airway instead of the crook of your elbow where the chin can easily be tucked down to prevent the choke. huh you would think someone with so much experience would know this apparently not.,1427846400,,355,4.159420289855072
8610358,5,B00EYO1JLM,"I'll have to admit that I am kindly disposed to any DVD by Mr. Burrese.  I have several of them, and they invariably provide superior instruction in techniques that will work in the real world.  This DVD was no exception.  Mr. Burrese methodically demonstrates common and uncommon chokes and carotid restraints in a step-by-step manner that is easy to follow.  He also distinguishes between holds to be used for street defense and martial arts tournament fighting.

The quality of the video production is adequate; nothing to shout about, but nothing really wrong with it.  That being said, it doesn't in the least diminish what Mr. Burrese has to offer.  As a teacher, he is thorough, patient, and very concrete in his explanations.  One nice thing about all of his DVDs is his acknowledgments at the end of each:  he thanks his assistants and everyone involved in the making of the video.  Even though he is a master of his craft, he is not arrogant, but very humble and gracious.

It seems to me that this DVD would be a valuable tool for martial artists, people just wanting to learn self-defense, and also security and law enforcement personnel.",1388016000,2,1150,4.786802030456853
8610359,5,B00EYO1JLM,"Burrese's books and DVDs are always top notch and this one is no exception.

I have written on chokes and sleeper holds in books and magazine articles but I still found lots of variations I hadn't seen before and plenty of subtle nuances to make my favorites even better, meaning, more miserable to the threat.

As always, Alain Burrese keeps his explanations and techniques simple and trimmed of the unnecessary. He doesn't come across as a macho tough guy and all the nonsense too many instructors display. Instead, he comes across as a regular guy who knows the material and earnestly wants the viewer to know it too.

You get two concepts and approaches for your money: He teaches proven methods to render a street attacker unconscious as well as techniques for the competitor.

Good stuff and a valuable DVD for any martial artist.",1381881600,9,836,4.784722222222222
8610360,5,B00EYO1JLM,"This DVD is great, has chokes and techniques for on the mat, on your feet and in the street.  All easy to understand, shown and explained Alain Burrese style. G Bowes Havasu Karate & 3 Battles.",1381622400,3,193,4.361111111111111
8610361,5,B00EYO1JLM,"I was blown away by Alain Burres's latest DVD, Chokes and Sleepers. Firstly, Burresse, a very respected Hapkiodist and martial arts teachers leads off immediately with his request to train safely.  Chokes and Sleepers are deadly force techniques. Caution must be employed and sensitivity to your training partner must be observed even to the extent of having trained medical staff on the scene. Secondly, Alain moves forward by presenting eight different chokes in detail. The DVD includes Rear naked chokes, side shoulder chokes, arm wrap chokes, rear collar chokes, front collar chokes, cross chokes, sleeve chokes and chokes in the prone position. Kudos to Alain Burrese .  The DVD is well done and impressive. I recommend Chokes and Sleepers without hesitation.

8610362,5,B00EYO1JLM,"Mr. Burrese has done it again ! A+ dvd. Very well rounded shime waza syallbus. From naked to cloth- street to ring. All will benefit beginners to advance students. He is one of my favorite dvd instructors. Contained some bottom of gi jacket chokes that I have not seen before. If you own a dog , and carry grociery bags for clean up he shows a neat little way to used a shopping bag as a ligature. Very creative. Look forward to his neck locking dvd in the future.",1381276800,5,464,4.224719101123595
