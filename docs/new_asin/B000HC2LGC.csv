2632765,5,B000HC2LGC,"My 9 year old son and I and sometimes his 5 year sister have sat on sat. nights watching these hot wheels movies and I must say I think they are fantastic.  The sound tracks really line-up with the movie and there is great action and some comic relief to take the edge off.  We were the first to pickup a copy of the ULTIMATE RACE on the day it came out, we watched it with our mouth's open and some questions answered from the last episode. The cars and the characters are within the age scope of our son so he can identify with the cars and lingo with the technology of the teams.  We will be waiting for the next round which might be in a movie form because not all of the characters die off like we think.  Did you see anyone die?, perhaps floating YES but not die.... just a though.  FAST PACE, FAST RIDE, ENJOY IT",1166054400,2,819,4.062111801242236
2632766,2,B000HC2LGC,"What a disappointment! Of course, compare to Hot Wheels World Race the whole series was a disappointment, more about that later. It would seem that Mattel Entertainment ran out of money to produce a final episode that would tie together all the loose ends.

If you've been following the series you know that there are two street racing teams, the Teku and the Metal Maniacs, matched up against the Drones. These teams race in an effort to win Accele-Chargers, which we find out in this last episode, have no real use out side of fooling Gelorum. As the series of movies progress, yet another team enters the fray called the silencerz, who we find out, in the very last seen of this episode, is led by Vert's father, but it is not explained how or why.

In the first episode, we are reintroduced to Kadeam, the only character in my opinion, that had any real moral fiber. Kadeam gets trapped in this same first episode and later is turned into a Drone. If any one deserved to be saved it was Kadeam. But sadly, in this last episode he is made out to be a villain and dies in the end. Instead the Teku and Metal Maniacs team up and enter the Drone's lair. Once in the lair they save Mark Wylde with a minimum of resistance from the Drones.

By this point, it is clear that the writers of the series had written themselves into a corner, which began with the introduction of the silencerz...a very bad plot twist. In a vain attempt to add some suspense, we find out that Gig is really a Silencerz operative, but we are also told that Tezla stole Gig from the Silencerz. WHAT?  That would mean Tezla knew about the Silencerz long before the World Race. It's really sad when you see writers do things like this.

The rivalry between Tork and Nolo is resolved in a four-sentence conversation between the two. The relationship between Lani and Taro is barely addressed and they should have been brought back together for some love interest. The death of Vert's mother, which seems to have created much of the animosity between Vert and his father is not addressed either. At the end, the Teku and the Metal Maniacs are left with no cars and Vert enters the Silencer'z lair alone and is captured. The very last seen shows a silencer walking up to Vert, slides away his face shield to expose Vert's father, who says, ""Son we have to talk."" And that's it, the movie ends.  Instead of being left with a feeling that the good guys won over evil, you are left saying, ""WHAT???""

This reminds me a great deal of your child falling in love with some fabulous toy on television that costs a small fortune. Then when you finally scrape the money together to buy it, the toy either breaks right away or in no way functions like shown on television. That's how disappointing this movie is.

Really the whole accelerator series was a let down compared to the World Race that had a great plot, writing and animation. With the movies targeted at children, glamorizing street racing, which is a criminal activity, isn't the most wholesome concept to base characters on. Next, the plot in accelerators makes no sense, for instance, why would Taro, a multi millionaire adventurer, get involved with a bunch of street punks/criminals? Also, with five million dollars in his pocket, why would Mark Wylde get involved with the same group, when he could have easily bought his way into Formula racing and continued to compete against his brother, who was clearly rich himself? Then the idea that Tezla cut off the supply of Nitrox-2 in order to conduct his own research, by himself, doesn't make sense either. And how were the Drones able to take the ring of power out of Hot Wheels City when it was pointed out in World Race that only a human could do so?

Now, I have to ask, did a ten year old do the animation? In World Race, the characters were well proportioned and believable. In Accelerators, they look like steroid nightmares. And why do they all have elephant sized feet? This includes Lani who also seems to have packed it on around the hips. They look like a first attempt by someone who just started out in animation.

It is possible, if enough people write and complain about how this movie ends, maybe Hot Wheels will produce another movie that will end the series properly.

This review was written by Ray Hansen, author of the Nina Steel Adventure Series and a father of an eight year old, who is very disappointed over this movie.",1165363200,14,4419,4.545911949685535
2632767,4,B000HC2LGC,"My 5 year old grandson & I have watched every movie since The World Race, and we just love them.  However, after waiting for the Ultimate Race, we were a little disappointed.  There were too many loose ends, so I am guessing there is another movie in the works.  Sure hope so.  Sean can recite most of the movies from memory, we sometimes watch all of the movies in one afternoon, especially here in Oregon where we have many rainy days.",1165363200,2,437,4.3580246913580245
2632768,5,B000HC2LGC,"If you haven't seen any of the Acceleracer movies then you don't know what you have been missing! The Ultimate Race is an incredible fourth installment in an excellent series that will captivate Hot Wheel fans of ALL ages. I am a mother of 3 small boys and I love these movies! I don't know about this being the ""final"" movie though. There were plans for a fifth and there certainly is the potential for a fifth...but I will digress. I do not want to give too much of the story away!",1164844800,2,483,4.260869565217392

2632804,5,B000HC2LGC,"After picking up a couple Hotwheels movies at garage sales, we looked for over a year for the other 2 in this series, and finally found them at Amazon.  They were only about $5 each and Movie 4 was probably the best, from a ""Mom"" point of view.  It had an interesting story line which tied in all 3 previous movies.  The whole family of 5 was interested in the movie and we wish there were more!",1325462400,,395,4.103896103896104

2632806,5,B000HC2LGC,"I don't agree with some of the other reviews of these movies.  They are intended for kids and are really good in my opinion.  My husband and I both have enjoyed watching these movies with our kids. If you watch the micro episodes most details in the story line get filled in for you.  Like most movies, it leaves the ending open for another movie later but does in my mind settle the original issue.  I HIGHLY recommend these movies!  We have been telling everyone we know about them.",1195257600,,484,4.393258426966292

2632808,5,B000HC2LGC,We are Hot Wheels nuts...but even if we weren't would be hard not to like this series.,1181433600,,86,4.117647058823529
2632809,4,B000HC2LGC,"My son and his friends love the Acceleracers and waited with bated breath to see the conclusion to this series and were not disappointed.  The Hot Wheels folks had a great product on their hands here, but it must not have made money because you cannot find the cars in stores anymore, nor any of the tracks.  Thats really too bad because the little guys loved all the characters and the colorful cars.  Guess they are all collector's items now.",1175904000,,444,4.525
2632830,5,B000HC2LGC,"My two boys, 5 & 7 yrs old, are simply obsessed with the acceleracer videos and cars! It started with the World race video, then we ultimately bought all of them, with this movie being the final in the series - or is it? The end was really left open for future movies, which my boys always talk about. I like the movies because they let the boys use their imaginations, there is no violence (except for car crashes, where almost no one ever gets hurt or killed) and the characters are colorful. The boys love to pretend with the cars (I finally bought some on ebay)and there is also a card game which they enjoy - they think it is all so cool, it is too cute!",1173312000,,659,4.15625
2632831,5,B000HC2LGC,"I believe that the Hot Wheels movies are meant for older children, but my 4 year-old loves all of these movies, and the ultimate race is no exception. Without fail, when he is allowed to choose a movie, he picks one of the Acceleracers volumes. Personally, I can't follow the story-line and I don't understand the draw, but my husband thinks they are great as well. I recommend this movie for children that enjoy playing with Hot Wheels and/or who like cares, trucks, etc. Great movie!",1171411200,3,485,4.651162790697675
2632832,4,B000HC2LGC,the ultimate race is gr8. the story line was good it's a movie to watch with the whole family.lt dosen't matter if your 6 to 66 Accleracers will have you on the edge of your seat.,1170892800,2,179,4.0
2632833,4,B000HC2LGC,My son loves all of the Acceleracers movies mostly for the diffrent look to it from other cartoons. I was disapointed though when they gave no ending to what they call the last installment. But overall good.,1168473600,,207,4.621621621621622
2632834,5,B000HC2LGC,All three of my boys love this movie and all the Acceleracer movies.  They have watched them over and over again and never get sick of them... neither do mom and dad.,1168473600,,166,4.1875

2632836,3,B000HC2LGC,"I bought all the ones that came out before this one. Thinking that they will do a better job (HotWheels). They failed me big time. This was done very fast, and too many details missing. I don't know where they are going with this, but the whole collection realy is not worth it. My 7 year old like it, but not I nor my 10 year old do. I think it is badly done, but I gave it a 3 star because of my 7 y/o son. I hate to say this for a HotWheels product but "" I seriously do not recomend this whole series"".",1168300800,,505,3.7735849056603774
