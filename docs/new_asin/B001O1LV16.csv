8328758,1,B001O1LV16,"What a shame--I was unfortunately hoping for something resembling the Criterion Collection issues of Ophuls' other films.  This is a fascinating work but this video is painful to watch and hear, a cheap pirate version of the original, picture and sound quality basically awful.  The cover includes the names Max Schreck and Annemarie Sorensen who have nothing to do with the film--some way to avoid copyright restrictions?  Unless you are a diehard Ophuls fan save your money for a better quality release.",1269302400,11,505,5.134146341463414
