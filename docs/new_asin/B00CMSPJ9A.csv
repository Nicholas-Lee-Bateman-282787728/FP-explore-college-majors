8583591,1,B00CMSPJ9A,"Painfully amateurish horror film about three friends who travel to California with a camcorder to make a documentary about what really happened to an apartment full of people, including the brother of the group's lone female who all supposedly died because of a radiation leak from an undiscovered uranium mine directly below the building.

The set-up is so moronic that the characters in the movie actually mock it--but that ultimately doesn't make any of it less idiotic.  If people die from radiation poisoning it's not something that would happen overnight like a building being filled with carbon monoxide--people would be sick for days or weeks or even longer before dying with symptoms that would be painful and impossible to ignore.

When the three arrive at the apartment building which is in a residential neighborhood in Los Angeles there is a sign on a fence stating that the building is hazardous and contaminated with radiation--but the building itself isn't even boarded up and there is no indication that anyone took precautions to try and contain radiation.  No other buildings in the neighborhood have been evacuated--in fact there is an apartment building next door where people not only still live they have their windows open--windows that directly face the supposedly contaminated building and appear to be no more than ten or fifteen feet away.

The acting is amateurish as well but The Sigil isn't the kind of bad movie that is fun to watch and mock because there are too many indications that the filmmakers and cast are entirely aware of how bad their movie is and that they might have made it like this on purpose because they thought it would be funny and they could possibly create a Birdemic or The Room style cult film

The Sigil is a waste of time with nothing to recommend it--it's lazy and incompetent and about as much fun as being forced to sit through somebody's badly shot home movies for an hour and a half.",1424563200,,1946,4.846385542168675
