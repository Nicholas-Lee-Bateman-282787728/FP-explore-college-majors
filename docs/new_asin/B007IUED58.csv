5089885,3,B007IUED58,"This is a pretty good movie, the comedy part is just OK but it does make you feel good as you see the characters change.",1342137600,,120,3.84
5089886,5,B007IUED58,"I gave this 5 stars even though I'd really only rate it 4 or 4.5. There are some ""huh?"" moments, however some viewers are completely devoid of a sense of humor and have dropped its average rating by giving it one star. It's FAR better than even a 3 star film, so I wanted to pad the average.

It's a quirky story about when roles get reversed and the ""popular"" workers become bottom of the food chain.

All-in-all, if you're even a little bit of a David Cross or Sean Astin fan, you won't be disappointed.",1339977600,4,505,4.25
5089887,3,B007IUED58,"Nothing too over the top, but a nicely paced flick with good humor.  It's on par with the show ""Workaholics"" and benefits from good casting. It seems that the director or the producers were playing it safe with the storyline, and not getting too outrageous, but the film makes a good Sunday evening rental.",1339977600,,306,4.666666666666667
5089888,1,B007IUED58,"If it were only unfunny, this movie would be watchable.  Unfortunately, the main characters are unlikeable, and it's not until they thrown in with ""the girls"" that they discover what awful people they have been and decide to mend their ways.  A more appropriate title would be, ""unlikable privileged white people being rude to their coworkers"".",1339891200,5,344,5.125
5089889,5,B007IUED58,I laughed a lot during this movie.  It's completely silly and over the top!  A combination of 9 to 5 and Office Space.,1338249600,,118,4.086956521739131
5089890,3,B007IUED58,"""From now until the end of time today and everyday shall be know as secretaries day!"" Mike (Astin) and Rodney (Vartan) are the best salesmen and Treadstone tire, and they know it. Being rude to everyone has become standard fare until their boss dies. When Ken Castro (Cross), who has been the brunt of their jokes, takes over he immediately demotes them to secretaries. The two realize how they have been and begin to change their ways. I will start by saying that I liked this movie and laughed quite a bit but this is also nothing amazing at all. Very predictable and pretty much a no substance movie but it is worth watching and I liked it. Think ""Office Space"" but a step above on the absurd scale. There really is nothing to say about this as there is really nothing to it but I again liked it and I think it is worth checking out. Overall, if you liked ""Office Space"" you will like this. This are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. I give it a B.",1336003200,7,957,4.2349726775956285
5089911,2,B007IUED58,"Too bad the good actors in here wasted their time making this movie.  I'm sure immature frat boys would love it though.
Everyone else - save your money.",1404950400,,152,4.428571428571429
5089912,5,B007IUED58,A fun story with a moral overtone. Its a pity this movie was not shown in more cinema's as it was a story line worth showing and well acted by all.,1400025600,,147,3.774193548387097
5089913,1,B007IUED58,"Within the first ten minutes of the movie, the writers rely on humorless jokes involving toilet humor, feces, and bodily functions.  This is a portent of an ill-conceived movie that lacks creativity and imagination - and Demoted delivers just that.  The entire movie was vacuous and insipid.  The other one star reviews here on Amazon are spot on and cover many of the problems with the film.

If you are determined to waste time watching this film, check it out of the public library and spend your money on something worthwhile.",1381104000,,530,4.791208791208791
5089914,3,B007IUED58,This is worth a watch but the ending is lame and there were some unneeded sexist stereotypes and assumptions.  The film would have been perfect w/o that.,1373328000,,153,4.666666666666667
5089915,4,B007IUED58,"This movie is hilarious!  The tables are turned on these two guys, in this fun movie.  It also shows the harsh disregard men have towards women in clerical roles.  Granted it depicts ""the old school"" way things were, but is still super funny.  It also has sensitive moments enveloped in the hilarity. I highly recommend it for a light-hearted evening of comedy.",1362787200,,361,4.774193548387097
5089916,4,B007IUED58,nice item. price is good. couldn't have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.,1359072000,,120,5.05
5089917,2,B007IUED58,Same old cliche office jokes. Why wasn't I surprised when a man on the toilet scene was the centerpiece of the humor?,1354924800,,117,4.363636363636363
5089918,4,B007IUED58,"It should be noted that I'm a bit biased, being a huge fan of David Cross ever since the days of ""Mr. Show"" (and of course, he gained the status of legend for his role of Tobias Fuhke on ""Arrested Development""). Anything this quirky guy says or does is very funny in my book, and ""Demoted"" is no exception. He plays the awkward, stumbling character that he has become known for in all his work, and the results are the same: it's just plain funny. Therefore, if you're a fan of David Cross, you will not be disappointed.

The story revolves around three tire salesmen, one of which is named Ken ""Don't Call Me Kenny"" Castro, played by David Cross. Ken is perpetually teased and tormented by his co-workers, so it comes as a delightful surprise to him when he receives an unexpected promotion (due to an odd set of circumstances), that positions him as the new boss of all salesmen- including the ones who have made his life so miserable. Ken's first order of business is to give his tormentors a taste of their own medicine. He chooses to demote them... to male secretaries. Finding the employment market to be inhospitable, the demoted duo has no choice but to join the pool of secretaries, a group that is none too receptive, given their past exchanges.

""Demoted"" is by no means a masterpiece, but it's a very good comedy that's well worth watching for people who like to laugh at the nuances and relationships of the workplace- oftentimes, as they say, there is a lot of truth in fiction. Things can be exaggerated a bit at times, but overall, this story remains fairly close to what ACTUALLY happens in setting of the American workplace. Although this is clearly a low brow movie, I was quite surprised to see how the writers subtly began transferring the viewers' sympathies from one character to another- it was unexpected and well executed. ""Office Space"" focuses on cubicle work, ""Extract"" focuses on blue collar factory labor, and ""Demoted"" is an interesting look at the world of salesmen and secretaries.",1347667200,,2015,4.6892655367231635
5089919,3,B007IUED58,"Mike Murphy (Sean Astin) and Roddney (Michael Vartan) are two hot shot tire salesmen for the Treadline tire company. They can do no wrong in the eyes of their boss Bob Farrell (Robert Klein). They treat their fellow employees with disrespect and play nasty pranks. When their boss suddenly dies from what appears to be an overdose of lap dances, the office politics change as the brunt of their humor, Ken Castro (David Cross) has become their boss. Rather than fire these two, they are demoted to the secretaries.

After some initial friction things smooth out to where our two bad boys lead an uprising against the constant misuse and sexist attitudes of their bosses. Sara Foster of D.E.B.S. plays Jennifer, the fiancee of Rodney.

The film is crude at times, but compared to others in its genre, it is rather tame. I found the humor to be light and at times forced. The plot is predictable with much the humor is on the immature side. Too much of the movie is filmed inside a restroom.

5089920,1,B007IUED58,It's extremely sexist and absolutely not funny. Only the threat of the most horrible violence or a full lobotomy could make me watch this again.,1342224000,2,144,4.8

8517948,4,B007IUED58,I don't understand the real hatred of this movie. I found it to be a very cute movie. there were no surprises as far as the story or which way the characters were going to go. We have the 2 uber superior salesmen at a tire company. the are pretty much very mean guys and allegedly irredeemable. Michael Vartan and Sean Astin are pretty mean to just about everyone so you almost love the fact that they get their comeuppance. The primary target of the jabs is the company worm and yes you will dislike him too. Then we get the usual story of the 2 guys having a change of heart and becoming human beings. It had its funny bits and I did laugh quite a bit. Some the of situations were hysterical.  I really don't get why some of the reviews are so negative I did enjoy this movie.,1502668800,,778,4.152317880794702
