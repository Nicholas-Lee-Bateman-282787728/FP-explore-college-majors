5391175,4,B00A7049SW,Who wouldn't be angry to discover a patron ripping pages from library books.  Gentle soothing compassion takes over and Miss Librarian discovers the reason behind the 193 page being ripped.  Of course it didn't hurt that I love the main actor.,1370908800,,243,4.902439024390244
5391176,2,B00A7049SW,"Starts off good and involving, turns into a cute romance. Nothing original, but cute. Unfortunately, after the first hour it just loses all momentum and becomes really boring and flat. It's not that it is horrible, there's just a lot better romantic movies out there.",1369094400,,267,4.955555555555556
5391177,4,B00A7049SW,The DVD was brand new considering it's affordability. Only thing about it is the quality seemed a bit off as if watching a movie on your computer with slow(?)Otherwise it was clear and the subtitles could've been larger.,1361491200,,220,4.815789473684211
5391181,5,B00A7049SW,very cute movie ........I have been watching Korean Drama for a while,1448323200,,69,4.833333333333333
5391182,2,B00A7049SW,"Premise is promising. Whoever green lighted this at Asian Crush needs a ROPE around their necks. FAST!

All momentum and NO yield! I will NEVER get back the two hours I spent watching this ""film"". If I took that massive dump I should have during this film, I might have missed something. Oh well...

Pros: Subtle tension; so subtle that smooth glass is rougher. The male lead, Lee Dong Wook, is really, really superb. You think he's a loser bum or unemployed but he f**king OWNS a high-end Japanese restaurant in this Korean city. Damn, didn't see that coming.

Cons: No action, no big romantic end scene, everything implied. Did she end up going out with him? Great romance like Anthony and Cleopatra? Did it turn out to be a great marriage? Does she live a more meaningful life other than the routine one that every pretty single woman in Seoul lives? Does the female main character get out of that dead-end library job?

At first I was thinking I was some room temperature-IQ knuckledragger who missed the meaning of the ""film"" (term used loosely here) I do not have an MFA from some half-assed cinema school to defend or justify!

The curly-haired library volunteer was useless. He had no chance to get ANYWHERE with female lead; left to maintain his existence with his pathetic ""one-hand romance plan""...

You want to give an epic beat-down to the good-for-nothing female characters. All are a waste of oxygen. They need to be bitch-slapped. HARD.

Overall, if you like all build-up and absolutely no release, torture yourself by watching this movie.

Warning: if you watch this during date night, I GUARANTEE you will get NO ACTION afterwards...PATHETIC....",1448150400,,1663,4.830985915492958
5391183,4,B00A7049SW,"This is a sweet story with a slight twist and a predictable ending.  If you are a fan of LDW or Eugene, you will enjoy it.",1441670400,,122,3.6923076923076925
5391184,4,B00A7049SW,cute and sassy,1437177600,,14,4.0
5391185,5,B00A7049SW,The title of the movie is not as catchy as the storyline once you began watching the movie. Its a heart warming storyline ... a must watch for me.,1435190400,,146,4.068965517241379
5391186,3,B00A7049SW,I recommend this movie although it was a sad at times. It was a easy movie for anyone to understand his story.,1429142400,,110,4.045454545454546
5391187,5,B00A7049SW,Wonderful film about healing broken hearts.,1429056000,,43,6.333333333333333
5391188,5,B00A7049SW,Great story.,1428451200,,12,5.5
5391189,4,B00A7049SW,LDW is a favorite & I had not seen this movie so gave it a try...good even if a little slow moving at times.,1427068800,,108,3.5416666666666665
5391190,4,B00A7049SW,"Cute story, not what you would expect from the title, but it does makes you smile. The plot is simple but intriguing - a few surprises. Well worth the watch and if you are a fan of LDW - it's just another example of how he has grown as an actor as this movie was released in 2008. There were a few lags..but not enough to bore you.",1424736000,,331,3.8823529411764706
5391193,5,B00A7049SW,Beautifully done! Lovely pace. Great story. Wonderful acting.,1418342400,2,61,6.75
5391194,2,B00A7049SW,"See the Smiling couple on the Movie Ad ? They don't do that for most of the movie.
Also,The actress actually has long reddish brown hair throughout the movie !
  As the title implies this is about heart break. From lost loves. it is a bittersweet movie about how hard it is to move on &how answers to ""why"" are things we're obsessed with, but needing them (answers) is just an illusion.
 It is hard to like the main girl. She's unhappy & irritated by everything. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a very modern amount of swearing, which takes away from the sweetness that they are trying to infuse the movie with. All of the females characters are unpleasant. There is a happy-ish ending, but it comes after alot of heavy heartedness.",1413417600,2,746,4.511111111111111
5391195,3,B00A7049SW,"It started off as an interesting, light drama with some comedy and pretty good acting. Close to the end it began to dwindle and the plot became watered down. If you're looking for something that is not too heavy and not too silly, this is it.",1409011200,,242,4.282608695652174
5391196,2,B00A7049SW,It moved too slow.,1404691200,,18,3.75
5391197,4,B00A7049SW,"Several reviewers of HEARTBREAK LIBRARY have lamented that this film suffers from excessive slow pacing and a static plot. This is true enough but I think that in this case the pacing and static plotting are purposeful in that the director wished to parallel the external trappings of a diminished real time with the internal workings of a mind that has suffered a cruel loss and must work haltingly to regain his moral rebalancing. Lee Dong Wook is a man who goes to a library ripping out page 198 from books at random to find a message from a woman who has dumped him. Yoo Jin is a librarian who initially takes offense at what she sees as pure vandalism. Little by little she causes him to open up and she determines to help him even as she cannot help herself with her own breakup from her lover. The middle part of HEARTBREAK LIBRARY gradually reveals a growing closeness between them, but unlike most Korean romance dramas, there is no overt passion brewing. Instead she helps him as a way to help herself. Lee Dong Wook reveals himself to Yoo Jin as he does to the viewer. This film takes a daring tack in that the audience is invited to peek into the workings of a tortured mind. Not all viewers are comfortable with interacting with any lead but I found the process exhilarating. HEARTBREAK LIBRARY reminds us that the memory of pain may (or may not) lessen the grief of one's soul.",1403913600,5,1391,4.5019762845849804
5391198,4,B00A7049SW,I liked the lead actor and actress in this movie.  They portrayed their characters without exaggerating.  The movie gave an interesting perspective on past and a new beginning love.  I like the ending with thoughtful wisdom about the past love.,1403395200,2,244,5.05
5391199,3,B00A7049SW,"after watching Korean TV drama series on another streaming network, this movie was a real disappointment as for me it was just too slow moving and rather boring. I expected more because other Korean dramas I have seen I have loved.",1402876800,,231,4.658536585365853

5391201,1,B00A7049SW,"I love Kdramas and most of them I don't have to worry about offensive language, sadly this one felt it had to throw some in.",1394928000,,124,4.0
5391202,5,B00A7049SW,Love the actor Lee Dong Wook. I typically in the past have had a hard time always loving Asian cinema but I have found I really like Korean movies. Fantastic story line! I was already inspired to learn Korean but now I want to even more just from listening to it so much. Hope everyone else enjoys!,1388793600,5,298,4.245614035087719

8547333,5,B00A7049SW,This was a nice romantic comedy that did not follow the usual format of going overboard in usual K-dramas.,1481155200,,106,4.631578947368421

8547337,5,B00A7049SW,"This was better than I expected. The characters are funny and unique, the story is quite believable for a Korean RomCom, and I genuinely cared about what would happen and felt the ending was believable. Gonna watch it again!",1471219200,,224,4.769230769230769
8547338,5,B00A7049SW,"It was a really cute movie that makes you think. The two main characters were really fantastic at portraying those with a wounded heart. On the contrary to some of the other reviews, I felt like they had a deep connection as they sought to help one another progress from their obsession with their former loves. I felt like it was more of a thoughtful and relaxing movie, rather than a dramatic one. I would recommend this movie.",1465171200,,429,4.512820512820513
