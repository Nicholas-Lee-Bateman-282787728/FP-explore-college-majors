4722122,4,B005LAIGPA,"I have watched many superhero origin films throughout the years.  Many have been great (Iron Man, X-Men & Batman Begins) and many have been awful (Daredevil and Green Lantern). All of these films are different in an assorted number of ways, but they all have one commonality: a nascent superhero's initial revulsion towards his/her special abilities, (this includes Batman, whose special ability is his use of personal pain as motivation to do great things) a disinclination to accept the responsibility that accompanies his/her great power, followed by the hero's eventual acceptance of the power and the additional responsibility that comes with the superpower. ""Chronicle's"" originality stems from the fact that the movie does not explore the conventional superhero origin story theme; and while I do not begrudge the conventional superhero origin story theme, it is the movie's diversion from the conventional superhero origin story theme that engendered my love for the film.

""Chronicle"" chronicles the life of 3 high school seniors. Andrew Detmer, (played by Dane Dehann) is physically and emotionally abused by his alcoholic father and peers; Steve (played by Michael B. Jordan) is the charismatic and universally admired potential class president; Matt Garrety(played by Andrew Russell)is preternaturally nice and smart, but flawed in many ways as well. Matt's kind nature and sense of pity allows him to be Andrew's only companion.

Andrew is relentlessly and mercilessly bullied. His morose personality attracts the attackers, but it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him.  As a means to create a distance between himself and other people, he enlists the use of a video camera; and he endeavors to use the camera to chronicle the circumstances of his life.  No one wants to be a part of Andrews experiment, and the bullying intensifies after the video camera is introduced. At a rave party, when Andrew's camera unintentionally lingers on an attractive woman, the woman's boyfriend expresses his displeasure by physically attacking Andrew before eventually spitting on him.

After the assault at the party, Andrew heads outside, where he retreats to a solitary place amongst the trees.  As the party continues to rage in the background while Andrew hopelessly sobs, Steve saunters into the video camera's view.  Steve is able to cajole Andrew into following him through a grove of trees so that a recent discovery can be filmed.  When Steve and Andrew happen upon the discovery in a ravine, Matt Garrety is already stationed at a deep gulch in the ground. The three boys venture into the gulch, which eventually becomes an underground cave of some kind. After an undetermined amount of time exploring the cave, the three of them come upon some sort of alien life form.  The intrepid explorers make the mistake of venturing to close to the alien, and then the camera goes black.

Cue to the scene where a healthy and happy Matt, Andrew, and Steve are cavalierly experimenting with their new powers in the back yard. All three boys have been endowed with the powers of telepathy; with Andrew becoming the most powerful of the three. The video camera is ever present, filming three boys goofing around with powers that could eventually change the world.  The three of them soon become bored with their backyard shenanigans, and decide to try some harmless experimentation on unsuspecting strangers in their town; that is until Andrew, who becomes annoyed at a honking truck driver, uses his power to run the truck off the road, critically injuring the truck driver. Andrew promises Matt and Steve that he will never again use his powers for ill, but it will be a promise that he will not be able to keep.

Before his eventual breakdown, Andrew, with the help of Steve, is able to use his powers to become popular, if only for a little while.  His new found popularity gains Andrew and Matt access to an elite house party, and while at this party he becomes friendly with a red haired beauty of a woman. This is the night that Andrew is finally going to lose his virginity. Unfortunately for Andrew, he is not able to consummate the act. His failure in this endeavor accelerates his descent into madness.

Andrew goes on to commit horrible acts of violence against his former tormenters; watching his horribly sick mother suffer from her debilitating disease incites criminal behavior; and the father who torments him as he convalesces in his hospital throws Andrew over the edge.  Andrew turns into a literal monster, terrorizing the city in which he lives with his powers until Matt has to put a stop to it all.

No one stood out, but the performances of the principle cast were uniformly good.  All three of the principle actors skillfully inhabit the psyches of their characters. I was also impressed with the execution of the special effects, especially with the limited budget (15,000,000).  Moreover, the ""found film"" sensibility of the finished product adds to the specialness of the three boys.  While watching the movie, you'll feel like you've discovered something precious as well.  I highly recommend this film.",1328486400,5,5136,5.040141676505313
4722123,5,B005LAIGPA,"The Chronicle creators (writer Max Landis, Director Josh Trank) have cleverly melded three common plot devices used individually for multiple other films: finding a mysterious object that affects characters (Green Lantern, etc.), the achievement of super powers through circumstance (Fantastic Four, etc.), and telekinesis (Zapped, Firestarter, Carrie, Phenomenon, Push, etc.).

In this hodge-podge, three unlikely friends - Andrew (DeHaan), Matt (Russell), Steve (Jordan) - find themselves with amazing powers, abilities that at first are used for fun and pranks but later turn to darker purposes.  Thought of as a muscle to be strengthened, the powers develop as the trio experiment more and more.  They soon find out, however, that excessive or strenuous use causes nosebleeds.  What's more, they learn the powers are dangerous when the fun and games end.

Filmed primarily through a hand-held camera, Chronicle manages to embrace newer techniques and fresh perspective without causing epileptic seizures (looking at you, Cloverfield).  Driven by Andrew's desire to document everything he's experiencing in life, in high school, at home with his drunken father, the hand-held camera holds purpose but is somewhat superfluous.  Especially since later scenes exploit the superpower angle to use the handheld camera at lengths far enough away to fully grasp scenes with action.  Very rarely do I truly enjoy this style of filmmaking, but the usage is sparse enough and unique enough to transcend inherent flaws.

Despite the recycled troubled teenagers angle and tired lessons about the dangers of power, the script is crisp.  Dialogue is witty, engaging, and realistic.  Like teens of today talk.  Not at all a forced hip, unrealistic, inauthentic, or self righteous like everything Diablo Cody writes.  Each member of the young cast shows talent, making the most of their lines at least enough to convince viewers of their status on the High School food chain.

Overall the effort is exciting and enticing, enough to draw in viewers emotionally while still providing enough FX action to terrorize the Seattle landscape with familiar yet fresh mutant vs. mortal X-Men themes.  This film soars high and overdelivers the entire time.",1328313600,3,2232,5.4476744186046515
4722124,5,B005LAIGPA,"Perhaps no other phrase in the comic book genre applies to daily life as much as Spider-Man's famous, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  Such a phrase has guided Spider-Man throughout his career, but occasionally the thought comes up: what if he didn't follow this famous mantra, and instead used his powers for selfish reasons?  While ""Chronicle"" may not be related to Spider-man, it perfectly explores what would happen if the famous saying was ignored.

""Chronicle"" follows three high school kids who have pretty ordinary lives: one is running for class president, one is the shy type whom nobody likes, and the last is the outgoing, energetic type.  One night, while at a rave, the three come across something mysterious, and find themselves in possession of powers that allow them to manipulate things with their minds.  As expected, they start off doing pranks (like using a leaf blower on skirts, for example), but as time goes on, being in possession of so much power can be dangerous...and even deadly.

Even among the glut of superhero and found-footage films, ""Chronicle"" manages to stand out, in most-part, due to that it's not really a superhero film: rather, it's really a story about how absolute power corrupts absolutely.  While I was watching the movie, I was really surprised to find myself being more interested in the teens, rather then the powers they wield.  All three are best friends, and they're good at heart, but are not above using their powers to mess with people's heads.  Andrew, in particular, is one of the most interesting film teenagers I've seen in recent memory, due to his miserable home life, and how he reacts with his new-found abilities.  Yet, from the beginning, it's clear that the power is inevitably going to corrupt the teens, which leads to a extraordinarily powerful third act that that genuinely had me more interested in what Andrew and the others were going to do, and not in the action that was taking place around them.

Even though there have arguably been too many superhero and found footage films over the past few years, ""Chronicle"" manages to feel fresh and exciting.  While it's faults are few (the CGI is at times a bit obvious), the strength of it's storytelling more then makes up for any flaws.  It's an unexpectedly gripping and thrilling film that focuses on the emotional consequences of how extraordinary powers corrupt ordinary people, rather then on spectacle and action, as other films would have done, and for that, I highly recommend it.",1328227200,205,2525,4.9408983451536646
4722125,4,B005LAIGPA,"This film was a surprise for me. Judging from the trailers it really could have gone either way, good or completely terrible. I wasn't sure if I needed to see it but I enjoy the actor Michael B. Jordan from the series Friday Night Lights, I'd seen most of the other films already playing and so I thought I'd give it a try. Overall, I was glad I did. This film takes the superhero genre and the found footage genre (both of which have become more saturated than ever recently) and mixes them together for a fairly unique and definitely interesting experience.

Directing: Surprisingly solid and inventive. If you hate shaky cam or hate how found footage always seems to be shot either from annoyingly too realistic angles or completely unrealistic angles then this film may still appeal to you. The kids powers allow them telekinetic capabilities and as the film progresses they start toying with the camera and using their powers to move it around or have it follow them. Along with that, possibly using that as justification, I found much more stable camera angles here, yet it provides the intimacy that found footage films benefit from when done well. The realism is well created, especially the first half of the film. In the later half when it turns into more of a low budget action movie I still found the directing and cinematopgraphy to be unique and well thought out, though the first half is my preference.

Acting & Writing: Since the story is so simplistic, and it's hard to talk about one withour referencing the other, I'll just lump the two together. The simple idea of three kids getting powers is really the bare bones of the story, the film seems to purposefully stay simple in aims of showcasing good cinematography and well done directing, but there is some emotional meat thrown on for more sustenance. For example the conflicts that arise are well established in the beginning. Also the seeming lead character (his name is Andrew) has realistic and compelling life circumstances, nothing is going well for him, and it gives a reason why he starts videotaping things but also justifies his changes during the film. The three relative newcomers, I think they've all had some smaller roles previous (I already mentioned Jordan and FNL), do an excellent job stepping into the parts they are assigned as Andrew, Matt and Steve. These guys have a good rapport, they feel like friends videotaping themselves and goofing off with powers. It's a positive that it feels as though they were given the chance to ad lib and play things naturally and they do so enjoyably and within the larger overarching story. The first half of the movie is great fun and when things start to escalate and get more serious as the film progresses it feels justified, exciting and the actors do an excellent job of stepping up.

Some things are easy to see coming and have been done before but here the majority of it is done in an understated way. One example, the idea that the boys feel the need to start setting rules regarding their powers, a fairly standard superhero theme, but played out amongst younger kids who are friends it becomes more interesting and genuine (in comparison to say an alien from Krypton deciding to be a symbol for good because he's almost a god).
The unique aspect of the story is seeing three friends discover powers together and then actually act like teenagers while it happens. Spider-man had some scenes with Peter discovering his abilities for example but he does so by himself and then because they want to keep the character's virtues they can't have him do some of the stupid things you know real teenagers with powers would do. Here you see all those things, the goofing around and the trouble, it makes a standard story feel unique and fresh and also keeps things compelling for the majority. It's all very evocative of a more well planned, better produced and more entertaining youtube video in that sense.

CGI: Isn't as overdone as most of the big action films, which is refreshing, it is used here to good effect. In some cases it looks really good and realistic, they definitely used some practical tricks which probably aid in this. It usually works best when done subtly. There are admittedly some spots where I had to suspend being critical of some less convincing CGI but it moves along at an even enough pace that it doesn't detract from the experience. Still the CGI is overall solid and actually impressive for a film that had a much smaller budget than some larger movies that do much worse. (I'll also say the CGI here looks more convincing than the wolves in The Grey, which was a movie I actually enjoyed, but good God those wolves felt like Twilight).

I recommend giving this film a try if you want an interesting movie going experience that isn't quite the norm. If you want some action or a sense of excitement I found it to be more action packed and at least as exciting (probably moreso) than other recent films Man on a Ledge or Contraband. There is also a nice emotional core and all the young actors for my bet give the best performances to be found in this genre of film so far (again especially in the first half). It's a plus that unlike the horror found footage genre you don't have to hear a lot of shrieking going on off camera, here there are some astonished yells but we see what is provoking them and it all feels cohesive. This is one found footage style film that feels more like an experience than some sort of trickery or teasing. I give this 4 stars, I liked it and I would watch it again.

**(I almost ashamedly admit that the well done execution of this film has me excited to see if the found footage genre can go some new places, Project X is coming and may be rediculous but looks like another attempt at something unique, with the amount of stock movies being put into production unique is a good thing).",1328227200,4,5884,4.620458891013384

4722550,4,B005LAIGPA,"Summary: ""Chronicle"" is a surprisingly unique and realistic take on the concept of superpowers

I'd heard a lot about this movie when it hit theaters, but never got to see it. Now I just caught ""Chronicle"", and have to say I was very impressed. Superpowers have been around for so long that it's hard to believe someone can find a fresh angle, but this movie did.

The plot is deceptively familiar. Three high school kids - a loner with an abusive father, a popular candidate for class president, and a girl-crushing slacker - stumble across a mysterious object in an underground cave. The object gives them telekinesis which the trio begin exploiting in different ways until one of them crosses the line. In the end, they're forced to grapple with the consequences of their actions and how to use the god-like power they've been given.

One little caveat about the object that gives them their powers: forget about it. I spent the whole movie waiting for some explanation for the glowing, crystalline thing underground, and ended up disappointed. It's never stated what it was - Alien spaceship? Government experiment gone rogue? Prehistoric creature? - and I eventually realized the point was that it didn't matter. To dwell on the source of their powers is to divert attention from the powers themselves, which is the real key to the movie.

Now let's talk about the powers. The difference is the execution. In every superhero story, getting new powers is a life-changing event. After the radioactive spider bite or explosion or experimental serum, the person sits around, asking the question, ""What should I do with these new abilities? Should I fight for good or evil?"" 'Chronicle' takes a surprising and more logical approach: the main characters don't do anything with their new powers. They just go on with their lives; running for president, asking the girl out, going to the school talent show, while basically going, ""Hey, cool, I can move stuff with my mind."" Apparently, the inspiration for the movie was YouTube prank videos, and much of 'Chronicle' involves the characters playing tricks with their telekinesis. They move a woman's car out of its parking space. One of them frightens a little girl by making a teddy bear lunge at her. Because of this, the characters come off as real jerks, but also realistic. I mean, sure they could fight crime with superpowers, but wouldn't teenage boys be more likely to flip up girl's skirts?

The characters evolve in surprising ways with shades of gray. They aren't the square-jawed Peter Parker or Clark Kent with hearts of gold. All of them have a good side and a dark side. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say I never lost sympathy when one of them became an outright villain. His path to the dark side felt like a natural evolution, but he also didn't feel like Dr. Doom in 'Fantastic Four,' where you can see that he's evil from the moment he walks on screen.

'Chronicle' takes the ""found footage"" concept in new directions. Early on, the main character starts using his powers to make the camera float around him, so we avoid the nausea-inducing ""shaky-cam"" of most found footage movies. Later, we cut to various cameras such as surveillance footage, news reports, and even cell phone cameras. This gives the movie a broader view than just one point of view throughout.

It's not without flaws, of course. The story eventually falls into the cliched ""battle across the city,"" which I didn't find as engaging as it could have been. Two guys throwing each other through buildings is just too familiar. I also felt towards the middle that it wandered a bit, and that the ""power corrupts"" moral has been done before. And I admit, because of the low budget, I would have liked the movie to go bigger. Maybe in the sequel.

Overall, I'd say 'Chronicle' is a refreshing take on both the found footage and superhero genres. It's not going to compete against 'Avengers' or 'The Dark Knight,' but it does show there's more to superpowers than tights and explosions. That's something that comic book readers are well aware of, but movie audiences have rarely seen before.",1472342400,,4134,4.812676056338028

4722787,5,B005LAIGPA,"I think what many have missed in the ""message"" of this film is that it is not a superhero movie.  Suddenly in possession of unexplained and undiscovered powers, these teens use them for their own amusement initially.  Then, as they develop in strength, their powers serve for little purpose than to achieve their limited aspirations.  With a Superman, or a Spiderman, the joy of unlimited power comes with the weight of responsibility.  Here, these children have no desire to right wrongs or protect the innocent, just to fit in, be popular, and enjoy themselves.  This is a breath of fresh air when it comes to the idea of possessing something superhuman.  In a sense it is very reminiscent of Groundhog Day.  If you find out you are a god, to what end do you use that knowledge?  The superhero instantly wants to be a savior.  The regular man needs to discover what it means.  This is a lovely movie, instantly enjoyable and worth more than one viewing.",1459555200,,955,4.664670658682635

4723360,2,B005LAIGPA,"I don't remember having heard of Chronicle until a friend of mind started talking about really wanting to see it a couple weeks ago.  When he showed up having rented it the other night, I figured we'd go ahead and watch it.  It really wasn't worth even the rental fee.

Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is a teen going through too much.  His mother is dying and his father has descended into alcoholism.  The only person he really interacts with is his cousin Matt (Alex Russell).

One night, Matt talks Andrew into going to a party.  During the party, Matt and his friend Steve (Michael B. Jordan) discover a strange hole in the ground, and they get Alex to bring his ever present camera to film it.  Soon the trio discover that they have the power of telekinesis.  As they develop the power, how will it change them?

As we were waiting for the unskipable previews to be done, my friend mentioned this was a found footage film.  I was worried they might make me sick, but at least on my TV it wasn't as shaky as seeing it in the theater.  However, I still had problems with it.  Most of the movie is seen through Andrew's camera, but occasionally they cut to a different character's camera, and for the climax, they use security cameras and that kind of stuff.  The logical part of my brain was screaming, ""Why would they have worked to piece it together from those things if it was found footage?""

If only that were the only problem with the movie.

The movie is just under an hour and a half.  While there are hints of trouble on the horizon, it really takes it almost an hour to get going.  Yes, that's right.  The rest of the time, we're sitting here waiting for something to happen as the watch the guys expand their powers and having fun doing it.

And when the story does get going?  So by the book predictable it's pathetic.  It would be nice for something surprising to happen, but every twist was fairly obvious before it happened, some longer before than others.

Characters?  I never felt like we really got to know them, so it was hard to invest in the film.  That's not a fault of the acting, which does the best it can with the script.

In fact, I fault the filming technique for some of my issues with the characters.  There were so many very short scenes or cuts in a scene that it was distracting and kept me from getting involved in the scene.

Finally, there's the language.  The movie was only rated PG-13, but there were way too many uses of the S word to count.  I was so sick of hearing that word by the end of the film.

So why did I give the film two stars?  There are a few scenes in the middle of the film that are fun and made me smile.

Additionally, I thought the effects were excellent.  Maybe it was because I was watching on a smaller screen, but I never saw the wires or anything else they used.  It was impressive, especially for a low budget film.

My friend who wanted to see the movie enjoyed it slightly more than I did, but not by much.  We agreed that Chronicle was a poor movie that should be avoided.",1433116800,2,3035,4.289241622574956

4723742,4,B005LAIGPA,"This is easily one of the best super-hero movies ever made, although it differs greatly from most conventions of the genre.

In chronicle the director chose the found footage method, which is masterfully executedalthough occasionally far-fetched (like the girl who films everything, even opening the door she sets the camera in a tripod!). Obviously it is easier to make a movie with this documentary view in 2012 than in the nineties like the Blair Witch Project. Today there are cameras everywhere, so the action sequences can be realistic and have multiple angles (most city dwellers have cameras in their cell phones); but this film faced the difficulty that arose from the fact that this method seemed to be exhaustedfortunately, it wasnt, and for the first time (to my knowledge) the found footage found the super-hero.

Other convention that is broken is the motives of the characters. Like in the super heroic RPG Aberrant from White Wolf, the arousal of great power doesnt automatically leads people to suit up and become a villain or a hero. It is a path with decisions, choices, challenges and loss. And we can fully empathize with all characters in this film, even the eventual villain.

The script is extraordinary and manages to portray real teenagers. Yes they are archetypesbut archetypes are real! There really are popular students representatives, the good looking philosopher or the verbally (and sometimes physically) abused young smart introvert. And in this story they find something which gives them much power.

There are also realistic and believable reactions from the world around them. Terror, fear, newsflashes, astonishment. It is thoroughly believable, which is much to say from a super-hero movie.",1424304000,,1729,5.2086330935251794

4723899,5,B005LAIGPA,"Andrew Detmer's got a tough life: he's bullied at school, his mom's dying of cancer, and his dad is an alcoholic. Andrew also likes to film things and his friend, Steve, gets him to film something him and Matt have found in the woods: a strange deep hole with a weird blue crystalline object inside it. After the boys develop telekinetic abilities, all bets are off as they discover exactly what they are capable of. The problem, however, is that with great power comes great temptation and Andrew begins to discover not only the extent of his power but what is deep inside of him. Soon, the group of friends are divided and one has gone off the deep end.

This movie is the boss. This is very much in the vein of Unbreakable, that is, the story of people pre-superhero or pre-supervillain, how they got their abilities, the discovery of their powers, the honing of them, and the ultimate decision as to what to do with them.

Filmed via ""shaky cam"" documentary style, Chronicle looks like a home movie but carries the strong story and special effects of a major blockbuster. Actually, it has a stronger story than most major blockbusters, but that's another topic. This flick is completely down-to-earth despite its out-of-this-world premise. By doing it documentary style, the character development of Andrew (Dane DeHaan), Steve (Michael B. Jordan) and Matt (Alex Russell) is through the roof and you care about each one, hope for each one, and get mad at each one when they do something you think you wouldn't do yourself. Well done, boys. Well done.

Telekinesis is the name of the game in this movie, that is, the ability to move and control things with your mind. While we've seen this power on screen before, this flick really gets into the potential of that ability from simply causing objects to float all the way to making yourself fly. Telekinesis would be the power to choose if one was presented with it because the majority of superpowers can ultimately come from it: flight, strength, stopping objects from hitting you, forcing bad guys to stop their actions, and more.

What makes this flick stand out is its intense study into what having such an incredible power does to a person, whether for good or ill. This is something we seldom see in standard superhero cinema as usually you got the hero or villain get their powers and already start using them based on their personality or because of how they're raised, or they are used a certain way because of a recent event. This flick asks the question--even answers it--does absolute power corrupt absolutely?

I've never seen a documentary-style superhero movie before. Correction: I've never seen a documentary-style superhero/villain origin movie before and I am curious if others exist. Will have to track them down because I thoroughly enjoyed Chronicle, was captivated by it, and it brings a level of realism to the material that even your most-seriously-attempted-at-realism superhero movies can't portray. It's about everyday people suddenly getting a powerful ability with everyday people reactions, temptations, and usages.

Such a well done flick. So good. You need to see this. What Blair Witch did for horror Chronicle does for the superhero genre.

Highly recommended.",1422230400,,3249,4.928702010968921

4723963,3,B005LAIGPA,"CHRONICLE is an interesting take on the pitfalls and responsibilities that come with having superpowers. Although other movies and TV shows have dealt with similar themes Trank manages to instil a fresh feel to his contribution, and once you accept the premise the story is plausible enough. It is, however, rather too easy to predict the outcome and thats the movies main flaw. My other gripe relates to the found-footage approach periodically used here. Im not a big fan of this technique as it can be annoying at times. But its not as big an issue here was it is in other such movies and it didn't overly affect my enjoyment. Also of note are the special effects which are impressive, as are the performances of the young, unfamiliar cast. Overall this is an entertaining if unsurprising film and is well worth a viewing.

4724786,5,B005LAIGPA,"If you were virtually limitless, what would you do? If you had the strength of one hundred men, would you use it to help others - or would you harm them, instead? These are seemingly simple yet complex philosophical questions director Josh Trank attempts to answer in the 2012 movie Chronicle.

When three friends encounter what appears to be an alien artifact in an underground cave, they gradually develop telekinetic abilities. As they experiment with their new-found power, they become geometrically stronger and more skilled. Their super-human abilities change their fundamental realities, blurring the lines between right and wrong.

Dane DeHaan plays Andrew Detmer, a high school outcast with a physically and emotionally abusive father. Alex Russell plays Matt Garetty, Andrew's popular cousin. Michael B. Jordan plays Steve Montgomery, who is currently running for school president. The director fleshes out a complex social interaction between the three characters based upon their backgrounds, social standing and morals - or lack thereof.

The movie is very successful in its approach: All of the action is viewed through the scope of Andrew's video camera. Through this sometimes-shaky lens we are treated to slices of Andrew's life. We begin to understand and sympathize with him as he is bullied,  beaten and abused by his father and by his classmates. We are sad when we are shown his mother, who is terminally ill - she loves him unconditionally, second only to his cousin, Matt.

The true crux of the film lies in the character study of Andrew and his disassociation from society. With so few allies to support him, director Josh Trank choreographs with frightening clarity Andy's descent into utter madness as his telekinetic powers grow to epic proportions.

This film is well-worth the watch for its commentary on the price of teenaged angst, alienation and its effects on the human soul. You will also enjoy the special effects and the surprising strength of love. The ending may not shock you, but it may make you think twice about what it means to be human.

4724788,5,B005LAIGPA,Thanks,1404345600,,6,6.0
4724789,3,B005LAIGPA,A bit predictable. Think Carrie with an alien presence/quasi-manipulation of the brainpower untapped. It was okay and a decent flick to pass the time.,1404345600,,150,5.291666666666667
4724790,4,B005LAIGPA,"Good stuff. The ""Chronicle"" looks, at first blush, like a found-footage version ""The Lords of Salem."" Fortunately, it's not. Neither the too-tired camcorder schtick nor even the super-powers and FX re the point of this movie. In the end, it's really about three very different kids, the Popular Jock, the Troubled Loner, and the more or less normal guy who ties three threesome together. Sounds formulaic? Don't you bet your popcorn, dear viewer.

""Chronicle"" starts with all of the ingredients of every similar movie. Just about, but not all, of your expectations are taken into account, but I'm not going to tell you which ones are fulfilled. This tale has less in common with X-Men or Wanted than with anime like Akira.",1404259200,,722,4.918032786885246

4724922,4,B005LAIGPA,Something seems to be lacking in this tale of friendships corrupted by power. The viewer is left with the feeling that he feel asleep during parts of the movie and missed important sections. Definitely read the book before the movie.,1404000000,,233,4.85
4724923,1,B005LAIGPA,"Even though the concept is intriguing, this movie is slow to get going and never really helps the viewer identify with anything that is going on.  Only the macabre individual may find this interesting.",1403740800,,201,4.911764705882353

4724925,4,B005LAIGPA,"Its a very good one time watch and combines the found footage type of film with supernatural horror/thriller.

Would recommend to anyone.",1403136000,,189,4.875

4724927,5,B005LAIGPA,"This film is excellent.  Not just a science fiction movie, it is also a study of the characters in the film.  Three college students gain ever-increasing telekinetic abilities.  One of those students however is just the sort of loner one would expect problems from.  While his friends seem content to keep their powers secret and simply indulge a few whims, the third is suffering from problems at home and an inability to empathize with most people.  Buy the film, and you'll see what happens next.",1402012800,,499,4.823529411764706

And the delivery date was estimated for after Christmas, and luckily I got it way before. The packaging was very sufficient and the DVD was brand new.

Will definitely purchase from this seller in the future.",1401148800,,472,4.619047619047619
4724931,1,B005LAIGPA,I paid a penny for this movie.  Plus shipping.  I don't mind paying for the shipping; at least they delivered as promised.  But this movie was apparently written by a self-involved not very bright high school boy for self-involved not very bright high school boys.  It was a mind-numbing waste of time and I want my penny back.,1400716800,2,327,4.586206896551724
4725162,4,B005LAIGPA,I really enjoyed this movie. I can imagine people watching this and wishing they could do these things themselves. It was fun to watch and I would recommend it to anyone .,1400457600,,171,4.375

4725165,5,B005LAIGPA,"Exciting and thrilling movie. Makes you feel like it can happen in your own backyard with your own friends. The transition from careless fun to a dark n powerful situation is great. Shows how power can actually change things wit certain emotions behind them. Also, the movie going on from the view from the camera adds on to the feeling that it could be YOU that finds something strange in a hole that ultimately gives you abilities you never dreamt possible. Loved it.",1399420800,,469,4.662650602409639
4725166,3,B005LAIGPA,"This awkward blend of several trendy genres has something to say, but can't quite work out the right way to say it. As the meeting point between superhero origin pictures, found footage compilations and moody coming-of-age stories, it arrives pre-loaded with all manner of tripmines and potholes, so numerous that it can't hope to avoid them all. It feels hokey and gimmicky, particularly when the action grows intense and the plot bends over backwards for an excuse to introduce more handheld cameras. The cast interactions feel rushed and shallow, hurrying past crucial bits of character development to reach the precious prize of a shiny effects shot. And even those, presumably the film's sizzle, unanimously feel weak and clunky. Chronicle has a point, and the ruminations it embraces about the underbellies of each genre have loads of potential. It's just so poorly executed, nearly across the board, that it's tough to focus on what's going on beneath the hood. Excellent as a rough sketch or a proof of concept, flat as a finished product.",1399334400,,1047,5.057803468208093
4725167,3,B005LAIGPA,this movie has great effects and makes the idea of telekinesis exciting. it takes the viewer to places as yet explored by the genre and opens the idea for much further exploration.,1399161600,,180,4.65625
4725168,4,B005LAIGPA,Was looking for a Sci Fi and I got just that. Was worth the money and I will get my moneys worth as I watch it several more times over the years.,1398988800,,145,3.5625
4725169,4,B005LAIGPA,It was dark. I like and would watch it again. I don't think is for kids 14 and under. good,1398902400,,90,3.55
4725170,3,B005LAIGPA,"Not a bad POV style movie. The ending sort of ""jumped the shark"" to me and could have made a good movie great had the script been flushed out a little better. Basically though, this is a movie for 12 to 24 year olds. Full of teen angst and high school culture story lines. If you are just wanting mindless entertainment and to see a decent sci-fi movie, then proceed. It you are looking for a thought provoking, edge of your seat sci-fi movie, well you will want to move on. I am sure this movie would have been much more appealing to me if I were a 15 year old bullied teenager with an alcoholic father. However for a grown man...it's just blah.",1398729600,,646,4.217741935483871
4725171,3,B005LAIGPA,It's actually pretty good if you can get thru the constant video taping scenes. Without the constant video taping I'd probably give it four stars.,1398470400,,146,4.88

4725223,5,B005LAIGPA,"This movie is seriously great. The storyline is compelling, and really makes you think about what would happen if normal people suddenly gained powers. It also makes you consider how someone with a rough background would treat others if they gained powers as well. There's a fine line between justice and vengeance that is explored by Andrew, and you honestly sympathize with him, even as he ostracizes himself and degenerates deeper into what I can only call insanity. The camera work is done as it would be if it was filmed by a bunch of teens, with jumps between smooth and bouncy shots. The visual effects can sometimes be a bit corny, but it doesn't detract at all from the excellence of the movie.
Check it out if you think telekinesis is the coolest thing ever, or if you just thing that hero movies are sweet.",1397952000,,817,4.602739726027397
4725224,5,B005LAIGPA,"Great movie! While I was expecting a superhero movie...this was not it. However I kept watching and it was hard to look away as events played out as they did. It's a great movie with a nice concept and superpowers and also a good moral. Great movie, just probably not for kids.",1397001600,,277,4.346153846153846
4725225,2,B005LAIGPA,"Movie could've been really good if had better script, more developed characters and developed plot. Like having  a kitchen with  all the euipment & tools and ingredients necessary to make a great meal, but just wasn't put together right,",1396742400,,237,5.051282051282051

4725227,5,B005LAIGPA,I don't know why this film made such a poor showing at the box office. It is most definitely the best video diary horror films I've ever seen.,1396310400,,142,4.107142857142857
4725228,4,B005LAIGPA,"The three young guys in this are highly convincing as three school chums (2 of them are cousins).  A little slow buildup is worth the wait as the effects from exposure to a strange (alien) device affects the trio who discover abilities bestowed upon them that only grow stronger with time and practice.  A lot of fun acts between these three, but not a lot happens that might have added to the story.  The scenes in the breakdown of the relationship between two of our protagonists is exciting, but even more wouldn't have hurt at all since their new-found abilities is a big part of our story. The finale is a bit predictable and sadly doesn't even give us a final CGI moment of amazement that I think would have added to the ending.  Overall, it was pretty fun and reminds me of another movie ""The Covenant"" where four warlocks have some powers which become greatly enhanced when they become 18, but using magic ages them.  Both movies deal with a coming-of-age theme for young men with unusual ""gifts.""  Enjoy!",1396224000,4,1013,4.6

4725282,4,B005LAIGPA,"Chronicle, like Unbreakable, Kick-Ass, and Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, deals with ordinary people who gain extraordinary powers and their struggle to use them responsibly. The key difference with Chronicle is the presentation, which is filmed in a found footage style.

The documentary camera work lends itself well to the first act, which is a very believable interpretation of a typical high school experience. A shy kid Andrew records his life on film, and we slowly get to know him through a variety of scenes that depict his classmates, abusive drunk of a dad, and everday struggles.

Andrew's teen woes take an unusual turn the night him and a couple of buddies stumble upon a glowing rock in an underground cavern them imbues them with otherworldly abilities. All 3 gain superhuman strength, the ability to levitate objects, and finally the ability to fly.

This is where Andrew's turbulent personal life takes a toll. His rage towards his dad and the predicament of his dying mother quickly turns to violence. All havoc breaks loose as Andrew takes on his self-proclaimed identity of an ""apex predator."" It's up to his 2 superhero friends to bring this destruction to a peaceful resolution.

Chronicle may not break new ground in comparison to the genre films that came before it, but it's simple style and unambitious story make for enough entertainment that I can easily rate it 4 stars and recommend it all Sci-Fi fans.",1395446400,2,1433,4.98326359832636
4725283,5,B005LAIGPA,"Amazing movie. Great acting, innovative story telling, poignant tribute to victims of teenage groing pains, surviving abuse, and the results of such scenarios told in an interesting sci-fi story.",1395014400,,195,5.758620689655173
4725284,3,B005LAIGPA,"I liked this. The first person camera style worked for this movie. I would have liked some background on HOW the boys got their powers, meaning, what exactly happened in that cave. That was never explained. I appreciated the realistic take on what a few guys would do with new found powers. It's a nice movie to watch. Lots of action at the end, but you knew it was coming.",1394928000,,373,4.3428571428571425

4725286,5,B005LAIGPA,"First off, being that this is a ""found footage"" type movie, it won't everyone's cup of tea. If that doesn't bother you, great. So, about the movie itself, I loved it! I'm a huge fan of the super hero movie sub-genre and I loved how this movie was more of an origin of a super villain. It's rare that the main character takes a turn to the dark side, but what was great about Chronicle was not only how you see the central character change from average Joe to super powered teen to borderline big bad, you can actual sympathize with the kid. The film not only gives a nice dose of super powered action, but touches on very real and sensitive and dark social issues like bulling and child abuse. Add a handful of terrific performances from a very talented cast, and Chronicle is a definite win! This movie hit all the points for me; it had the emotion, action, drama and a surprisingly refreshing dark, edgy take on the super hero movie.",1393200000,,935,4.379310344827586
4725287,4,B005LAIGPA,"I liked the movie, the lives of the three young men were very relevant. The super abilities and special effects were great. The complicated story within the story was the thing.

4725288,4,B005LAIGPA,"I enjoyed this strange, chaotic tale of alien (or perhaps some other) influence that renders three high school boys telekinetic powers.  As their confusion and power grows, so also does their strife with each other.  With increasing power, they invariably commit more and more powerful mistakes.  A genuine inspection of the ancient concept of ""hubris"", defined herein as the pride in one's own power or abilities which eventually brings their inevitable downfall.",1393113600,2,464,5.416666666666667

The flying football part is worth the price of the movie. How this got by me I don't know. As i am looking for such films. but it did. It was so short. I hope that good  ole Fox will make another this time for a longer film and a little something added. I often wondered if they could have had healing powers along with the other powers.. Thinking of Andrew's mother .It could have been much longer. I wanted more, But what I got was wonderful. Three very good actors.  And showing much feelings of love and brotherhood. I really enjoyed this film. I am ordering in blue ray soon so I can have it in that. A great big A+++++ from  me.

4725290,4,B005LAIGPA,"Chronicle takes a subject that weve seen done many times: teenagers who obtain super powers, but instead of trying to do something new, they just do it really well. Andrew Detmer is a senior in highschool, hes a virgin, loner, picked on, and on top of that has an alcoholic father and a mother dealing with terminal cancer. One day, Andrews cousin Matt takes him to a party and along with his friend Steve they discover a whole in the ground. When they go into the hole, the three of them discover a glowing rock which give them the power of telekinesis. At first they are only able to move small objects: lego pieces, coins, etc. They then discover that their new power is like a muscle and the more they use it the more powerful it is. They move on to being able to move larger and larger objects like dolls, supermarket carts, and finally a car. Andrew discovers that he can protect himself from objects by imagining an invisible shield, Mike discovers that they can fly by pushing themselves above the ground. Andrew goes from feeling lonely to feeling like he is high on life. I enjoyed how the director took his time in expanding the discovery of the powers. Every kid likes to imagine what it would be like to develop super powers and it was good that the director spent half the movie focused on that because for me, thats the magical part. Just as things look like they're going well, Andrews dad is suspicious of how he spends his time, tries to beat the s*** out of him and mom takes a turn for the worse. Andrew is angry, flies off and calls up a storm. Mike tries to  rescue him but Andrew unwittingly kills him with lightning. Andrew starts robbing stores for money in order to buy medicine for his mom, and when she dies, and his dad rages on him, he goes crazy. He uses his powers against the police and innocent bystanders and finally, his cousin, Steve has to kill him to stop him. Its not a thinking mans movie, but it doesnt try to be, its fun, action packed and takes me to recall dreams of my youth. Which is a spectacular thing for a movie to do.",1392595200,,2069,4.3462532299741605

4725490,5,B005LAIGPA,"I absolutely loved watching Chronicle. I happen to like all movies that feature people that acquire superhuman powers of any kind, so I was sold with the premise. Unlike other POV films, Chronicle does not suffer from the hard-to-avoid shakycam nausea. The fact that the movie is told from the perspective of (mainly) one hand-held camera does not mean the cinematography is any less striking.

One of the things that I appreciated: the story didn't need to over-explain it's origins. We do not need to know where exactly the powers came from. Aliens? Government experiment? Future-tech? Who cares? Instead, we get a pretty accurate depiction of the things that high school kids would do if they suddenly acquired superpowers. It has depth, it has some comedy, it's got some dramatic sadness and SUPERPOWERS! Go see it.",1390435200,,819,5.022058823529412

Chronicle movie poster

What if you suddenly became a god?

Director Josh Trank uses the hand-held camera technique to document the lives of three high school seniors as they become young gods after discovering an (alien?) force. Theres not much more to the movie than that plot summary so really, if youve ever wondered what if you gained super powersand what would you do? The trick is to show us something that is so ordinary that its special and thanks to good writing by Max Landis and Trank, we get that. Im not suggesting this is a greatly written movie, Im suggesting that it has been written to steer us in a certain way that retains realism and believability.

Blair Witch showed us how effective documentary styled filming can be and Cloverfield showed us how it can be used to bring on the cheese. You always have that nagging voice in the back of your mind- asking about tape and battery time and you wonder if someone would really, really be filming this much. In this case it works well and the camera slides into normalcy and you forget its first-person and just watch the onscreen action. The special effects are well done and seem even more realistic when combined with the lo-fi camera grain.

Back to the writing. Its important to note that whats been written out is just as important as whats been written in. Theres the clich of the trio. We have a loner (Dane DeHaan), Mr Popularity (Michael B Jordan) and a too-cool-for-my-own-life pseudo-intellectual (Alex Russel). The reason they work well together is because each posses the qualities another lacks and it keeps them focused on group concerns: exploring their new powers and getting stronger.

In younger days, I and my friends would play Adventure which was basically Dungeons & Dragons without the paper and dice. We would build scenarios and talk our way through our actions and create a story in real time. You do or say this and this is what happens after. You react and do that and heres what happens next. In the earliest games, we spent our time exacting revenge on those that wronged us and getting the girl we wanted. Eventually thoughts about our real non-life seemed unimportant and we began to think about being super-heroes and fighting other beings with powers and becoming worldly beacons of justice. Really, we did.

Chronicle could follow that same ambition process, but we are narrowly focused on this trio and the early days of their enhancement. High School life is still most important, and should be because that is all the characters know. We don't get answers for where the energy source came from and do not explore any of the hinted at tangents -like the world and government reaction to some of the incredible events the trio is at the center of. Theres a built in break for using the hand-held documentary style because you can say: if it wasn't filmed by this guy then we cant show it to you. Thats broken up in some nice shots where surveillance camera footage is spliced in at key moments.

Of course in any movie, you can criticize the actions of the main characters and figure you could have done better in their position. One character needs cash and so he robs the local (presumed) drug dealing a-holes. Thats not enough so he robs a gas station. At first I thought with those powers why isn't he making tons of cash or if you're going to rob something, rob an ATM or bankbut these are simple characters acting on impulse. This is a simple movie trying to explore what some would do if they suddenly became infused with super-human powers. Sometimes we come back with complex answers when in truth; it might all be as simple as this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the ending had a much bigger climax than I expected. I am not a movie critic, I am critiquing a movie.",1385683200,,4118,4.625170998632011

4725785,5,B005LAIGPA,"Totally unexpected and amazing. I have seen this title on and off for a year or so and have avoided it mostly because the trailer looked like it was going to be a silly teen anx/buddy movie. It actually is a silly teen anx/buddy movie, but with a few elements that are rare in major motion pictures of this ilk.

I am quite pleased with the writing and execution of this one, especially in the application of technology. While none of the tricks are ""new"" they are applied in a new way and that makes this a most unique offering.

It deals with some harsh realities in life, and although it was not a ""tear jerker"" per se, it is a weighty vision of life seen through the eyes of two cousins and their newfound high school chum.

I would watch it again -- years from now -- or maybe with a special friend....but I am unlikely to purchase it. It was definitely worth seeing once. Rent it now or wait til it pops up free somewhere, but make a note that this one is worth the time.",1385164800,,977,4.1861702127659575

4725788,5,B005LAIGPA,"I finally watched this movie two nights ago after ordering it on blu ray, and I honestly love it. I don't know why it took me so long to see it. A gripping tale of angst and the notion of great power becoming corruptive, ""Chronicle"" tells the story of Andrew, Matt and Steve. Andrew is the teenage outcast who has no friends, lives with an abusive, out of work father who drinks excessively, and his mother is dying of a terminal illness. He takes to recording his miserable life with a video camera. Matt is his cousin, a cool kid who drives him back and forth to school and tries to look out for him. Steve is the popular kid running for class president. The three bond at a teenage rave, and soon discover a mysterious crater in the middle of a field one night. They explore the crater, go deep underneath it, and find a bizarre, crystallized object of unknown (possibly alien) origin.

Later, to their surprise, they realize the object has bestowed upon them strange superhuman abilities, chiefly telekinesis and the power to fly. At first, of course being teenagers, they use their powers to play pranks (Using leaf blowers to lift girls' skirts, move unsuspecting peoples' cars around in parking lots, etc), but Andrew, the most emotionally put-upon of the three, becomes reckless and Matt tries to convince him they need to use their power responsibly and secretly. Over time, Andrew exercises his power to the point where it becomes stronger and stronger. So does his inner rage. He lashes out at his father, and even Steve! With his mother increasingly sicker by the day, he decides to use his power for selfish, potentially criminal reasons, with tragic results. It all accumulates in a very well directed and acted destructive battle across the city between a now out of control, psychopathic Andrew and Matt, who must do all he can to rein him in and stop this tragic menace.

A great, even thought provoking screenplay by Max Landis and director Josh Trank, very strong performances by the three leads (Dane DaHaan as Andrew, Alex Russell as Matt and Michael B. Jordan as Steve), and amazing cinematography add to a fantastic film. Sometimes it's true what they say, ""Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely"".",1383955200,3,2237,4.777777777777778
4725789,4,B005LAIGPA,"Storywise ""Chronicle"" may not offer anything new perhaps, but it does provide a new perspective on familiar sci-fi fantasy topic by focusing teenage anxiety. The story itself about three high school students with newly gained special abilities is rather contrived and even predictable, but with considerable storytelling skills, fine performances from the young actors and slick direction, ""Chronicle"" delivers.

After touching some blue-ish glowing object hidden under the ground, three Seattle high school students Andrew (Dane DeHaan), Steve (Michael B. Jordan) and Andrew's cousin Matt (Alex Russell) develop telekinetic abilities. For the kids the new abilities are just fun, especially for a bullied boy Andrew, until things go too far and get out of control.

They say, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" But what would ordinary high school boys do if they got some special powers? They are most likely to use them for something silly or trivial, if not evil. In ""Chronicle"" the kids are quick to find a new way to use their powers and enjoy themselves, but never attempt to be heroes of justice.

Thus what is really impressive about the film is its realistic characters. Even with these new powers, some just cannot find their places in school or family. You may not like the film's found-footage style which is overused in recent years, but ""Chronicle"" still makes for an engaging ride.",1382486400,,1408,5.1938325991189425

You become engaged as things begin to spin out of control, and the movie provides more than a few visual and narrative surprises along the way.

Their experiences are some times thrilling and terrifying. The climax feels incredibly powerful because we feel an emotional connection with the characters, and because, unlike larger superhero movies, there is actually something at stake.

Chronicle is a found footage film, which is a genre typically reserved for horror flicks like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, but lately is being used more and more for other genres of films, this and the teen comedy Project X being prime examples. Anyway, on to the film itself, it focuses on three high school kids, Steve (Michael B. Jordan), who is popular, outgoing, and running for class president, Matt (Alex Russell), is an average kid who has friends and does well in school, and his cousin Andrew (Dane DeHaan), who is a loner abused by his father and living with a terminally ill mother. At the beginning of the film, Andrew is already carrying his video camera around as he feels the need to record his life. He and with Matt go to a rave together and meet Steve there, who initially approaches Andrew because he wants him to record them as they go into this strange hole they found in the ground. The Hole is emanating these weird vibrating sounds every now and then, so they go into the hole to see what's making the sound and discover this strange glowing ""object"" which appears to be either a large crystal or UFO of some kind that causes their noses to bleed and they pass out. The film then picks up weeks later when they already have discovered the use of their powers and are testing it on a ball. At first, when they get their powers they just use them to goof off and have fun but later on the film takes a darker turn, mostly because of Andrew, and it's of course understandable. Personally, I felt Chronicle was a good film simply had too many flaws to make a masterpiece or even a great film. The idea was relatively original and interesting,a bunch of high school kids get superpowers but instead of using them to do good and save people they simply have fun, pull pranks and goof around, at least at first anyway. The biggest flaws in this film were, to me anyway, the fact that it was a found footage film, despite containing obvious CGI effects, and how it was completely unnecessary for the film, it actually took away from many scenes for me. Also how the fact that they were so open and nonchalant about their powers, openly using them in public where somebody might see them and possibly report them to the police or the government, like the CIA perhaps. I might understand if it was after they discovered how to fly, but it was actually before they did, so if the police or military wanted to apprehend them so they could use them as test subjects or as secret weapons for the military, they definitely could. Yet all three apparently are too stupid to be aware of this fact until after Andrew starts going bad. Another thing I didn't like was the very predictable plot and the very ""Hollywood"" style ending, which is another thing that took away from the ""genuine found footage"" aspect of the film. Now there were some good points to this film, most notably the action scenes, the dramatic scenes involving Andrew's home life, and the depiction of Andrew's downward spiral from weird outcast to raging psychopath, in ordinary circumstances someone with a history of abuse and tragedy similar to Andrew would probably end up either in prison, crippled, or dead due after reaching his breaking point. However, when he does finally reach his breaking point he possesses telekinetic powers and the ability to fly, so that just makes it much worse, and much more interesting! Overall Andrew is a somewhat likable and very sympathetic character who you could tell wanted to be good but ended up the way he did because of all the negativity he was surrounded by. It happens all too often in real life, and that really appealed to me. Concerning the strange object, it is never explained what it truly is, and that, combined with a scene towards the end which I'm not going to spoil, suggests to me that there is going to be a sequel, and if it comes out I plan on watching it, despite this being a so-so film for me, it intrigued me enough to watch a potential sequel, which is why it got a very appropriate 3 star rating from me. While this film was more of a Superhero origin movie, I feel the sequel is going to be a straight up superhero movie! I hope it gets made, and soon!",1364169600,,4471,4.514180024660912

4726315,5,B005LAIGPA,"I haven't read anything about this film, but I'm guessing it was a first effort for the director and most of the actors. I'm not saying that because they were bad, I'm saying that because the movie and acting was so fresh and different it just doesn't seem to have come from the mind of a ""Hollywoodized"" director.

Anyhow, the blurb will tell you that teens acquire some super powers and then experience troubles while exploring their new powers. This is a pretty standard premise (Heroes immediately comes to mind) but the execution of the story is way more thoughtful and interesting than anything else I've seen.

The most surprising part of the movie was how great the special effects were. I'm NOT a big fan of CGI films like Spiderman. I like my action a bit more authentic looking, and I thought that the depiction of the super powers in this film was incredibly realistic.

If you like this kind of concept and are willing to enjoy a slower and more thoughtful pace of movie making, I think you will enjoy this film.",1363392000,,1025,4.559782608695652
4726316,3,B005LAIGPA,"Teen age hormones are tumultuous enough; pile natural law-defying telekinetic powers on top, and you've got the mess that CHRONICLE delivers.  A story told from the point of view of ""found"" footage via handheld cams, CHRONICLE follows the antics of three seemingly normal teens who come across something other-worldly, an object giving them superhuman powers.  Suddenly they can move objects with their minds, manipulate matter. . .even fly.  And it's all grand fun until the most unstable of the trio, brooding Andrew (Dane DeHaan), gets his proverbial knickers in a twist, resulting in carnage and destruction on a most impressive scale--with his good-intentioned cousin Matt (Alex Russell) flying through the Seattle heavens desperately trying to stop him.

And it's darn fun to watch.

The shaky, docu-style type of cinematography climaxed with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>, making CHRONICLE look like a tired copycat.  And the ad-libbed dialogue of the trio using their new powers to play practical jokes works, for a while, until it grows thin once the story moves to its inevitable dark side (""Andrew's in trouble!  Andrew's in trouble!"").  There is really little to like about the teens once we get to meet them, so when bad things begin to happen to them there's nothing to compel the viewer to care; yet what CHRONICLE lacks in story and content is cancelled out by stunning visual thrills.  Who doesn't love a train wreck?

Also unlike similar ""camcorder"" films, it wasn't jumpy or choppy and it was quite easy to follow. The first hour of this film was amazing, unfortunately it did go downhill at the end. The whole film was done in a realistic fashion, making science fiction seem possible, until the end, when all hell breaks loose and it honestly just destroyed the whole thing for me. It was such a strong start, but such an awful ending.

The camera shaking was a little bit too much but it was full of the unthinkable things happening. The friends had powers but did not use them right and one of them totally went overboard in anger and took it out on everbody and everything in his path. It is like the bullied student in school want it to stop and got really pissed off and fed up with everything. His father did not treat him right and his mother was dying from cancer. That is enough depression there to go off the deep end! The camera movements in viewing the scenes remind you of Clover Field. That was a shaky and dizzy camera view of scenes in the movie to cause an headache! I wish they make part 2 of that movie. Great movie as for Chronicle.

4726337,5,B005LAIGPA,"What would you do if you had super powers? Would you use them for good, or for something else? Andrew and his friends discover an object hidden deep beneath the earth that endows each of them with extraordinary abilities, but as they soon learn, with great power comes great responsibility. CHRONICLE is their story, as told from Andrew's camcorder. The use of the first-person perspective in this is both a blessing and a curse, as always. It is often difficult to accept the footage as fact when it is so cleanly shot and scripted, which prevents the complete suspension of belief. As a work of pure fantasy, however, it pushes the concept to its veritable extremes, exploring the psychology of the super hero from an entirely new perspective. Andrew, Matt, and Steve take us through their daily lives, the challenges they face as teenagers, and show us just how thin the line is between good and evil. Little pranks have costly results, and without constant restraint, their virtually-limitless abilities quickly grow out of control. What director Josh Trank achieves in camera and through the seamless special effects is nothing short of amazing. Any of the believability that is lost in the storytelling is more than made up for in the clever camera work and the super-charged ending. Super hero fans cannot afford to miss CHRONICLE!

4726339,4,B005LAIGPA,"The whole hand held camera phase has become this big thing that you either love or you hate.  Many are vocal about hating it entirely and wishing that it had never been started.  I'm not one of those.  I mean, I am not a giant fan of it but I understand its purpose and find that the gimmick, when used correctly, can be fun.  I loved `Cloverfield'.  Maybe too much, but then again I'm not ashamed of that at all.  Many blame `Cloverfield' for the craze, and they are probably partially justified since that film did become a sort of `thing' for a while.

Hate on the gimmick all you want, but `Chronicle' proves that it can be utilized to seeming perfection.

`Chronicle' is a story of three teens who stumble across what appears to be an alien entity that gives them bizarre powers of mind control that allow them to become superheroes.  What teenage boy doesn't want to do that.  What `Chronicle' explores after the initial power surge is the impact that power has on the weak and the way it warps the mind and eventually controls it.  As a whole, it does a decent job of that.  The performances are well grounded, especially from Dane DeHaan who grapples with the darkness aspect of the transformation really well.  I was really impressed with the special effects, which were NOT perfect, but considering the budget and the overall visual scope of the film, they were truly effective.

The finale builds in a really aggressive nature.  I liked that.  Still, there is something missing here.  As much as I liked this film, it felt almost as if the themes present weren't completely manipulated correctly, like it was enough just to present them and not necessarily develop them.

Still, I highly recommend it.  It is intense and exciting and does a lot of things right.",1359590400,,1772,4.603833865814696

4726424,4,B005LAIGPA,"Sometimes, for reasons we cannot fully explain, a film succeeds in ways that neither we, nor the studio, honestly expect.  If you want a great example of just this sort of phenomena, look no further that the recently released and poorly named, Chronicle.  Shot on an almost ridiculously low budget by a director whose only previous experience was on cable television, it was released in the dead of winter - a time slot usually reserved for films that will soon be making their debut appearance in the remainder bins of your local Walmart.

But Chronicle smartly rises above its humble budget and its inauspicious release date by offering something unusual: a nuanced psychological profile of a teenager struggling to rise above the ruins of his home life.  Mashing up the ""found footage"" and super-hero genres, it wisely avoids the rote stereotypes often found in films of this nature, and instead gives us a briskly paced meditation upon humiliation, empowerment, hubris, and naked aggression.

By the time this pleasant little treat reaches its unexpected climax, the viewer is left wondering whether this might just be one of the more honest portraits of teenaged American life in the 21st century.  While the films are miles apart in tonality, one couldn't help but think back to Diablo Cody's Juno, an equally insightful look into the mind of modern adolescence.

If you are a fan of the unusual and/or unexpected, I would strongly recommend seeing this film, in spite of its terrible title and its less-than-inspired marketing campaign.  This is the kind of film that heralds the arrival of a new talent, and I for one will be eagerly waiting in line when the creators of this film release their next work.

The characters share powers and struggles that have graced the four-color pages of comics for decades but have the freedom of eschewing the necessity of selling toys in favor of a solid story unlike some recent flicks (I'm looking at you, Avengers). What we are given is a story of three teens who find something in the woods that gives them abilities beyond belief. These events are ""chronicled"" (See what I did there? Clever, huh? ;P) via one of the young men and his trusty camera. The plot is essentially the same as every other superhero flick but we get to spend a little more time getting to know these guys as people and not costumed heroes.

After some time and a few serious events the film takes a dark turn and I felt genuinely scared.

Reading some of the other reviews of ""Chronicle,"" I was a little reluctant to bother watching it. Yet another ""found footage"" film--maaannn, when are they going to realize that this technique has been done to death?--and there's not even any logical reason to use it here. Nevertheless, I was very impressed with what this film's creators were able to do. Really fine acting and storyline: The way the three very different protagonists interact is quite convincing. ""Chronicle"" also aptly portrays adolescent/high school existence, an age that so many films screw up with clichs and stereotypes. Very true-to-life dialogue: Whoever wrote the script did an outstanding job. All the Greek morality play elements, the theme of hubris, etc, add a great deal. Special effects are good but not too Hollywood-slick, which makes them all-the-more convincing. Humankind's common desire, unaided flight, is portrayed without strings attached: The flight scenes are, well, awesome, and they also capture the complications of achieving this dream. Plenty of surprises--love the ending.

Still, ""Chronicle"" would benefit from a little more-in-general (only 84 minutes?!), which is, I suppose, the best sort of flaw a film can have.",1353456000,29,1231,5.439790575916231

The plot was different that what the trailers led me to believe.  2. The filmography techniques were kind of annoying... Sometimes watching third person (typical fly-on-the-wall way of watching movies), but sometimes it was in the first person (via recordings)... that bugged me enough that I still haven't actually watched the whole movie.  So I think extended clips like this can help prevent you from spending monie on a digital rental for a movie you later wished you hadn't wasted money on.",1352937600,,653,4.692982456140351

Jordan as Steve Montgomery,Alex Russell as Matt Garetty,Michael Kelly as Richard Detmer,Ashley Hinshaw as Casey Letter and others. This is yet another Blair Witch Project,this time done through the eyes of three Seattle high school students.""Done"" is the operative word here,as in done this genre right into the ground and done terribly poorly.
The film finds Andrew as the school loner. He has a dying mother and an abusive,alcoholic father. Andrew decides to start taking a camera along wherever he goes(quite convenient),and during a party his cousin Matt and his friend Steve take a walk in the nearby woods,and discover a strange hole. Steve gets Andrew to come and film it. In the hole they all go and they come upon a strange crystalline structure at the end of the tunnel. Whatever it is emanates different lights and strange sounds,and when they leave the tunnel their lives slowly start to change. They start to discover they have the powers of psycho-kinesis. Andrew develops it faster and stronger than the others. Whenever something untoward happens to one the others gets nose bleeds. There is a definite symbiosis going on here.
At first they start out doing harmless lifting of various objects big and small. As their powers grow they have the ability to literally fly into the air and travel great distances. Andrew however is slowly but surely withdrawing from the others,his home life situation not helping any. After a confrontation with his father,he flies into the clouds and Steve comes to talk to him. It all ends as Andrew pushes Steve away so hard,he falls to earth and dies.
Andrews mother grows weaker everyday and when Andrew has no money to pay for his mothers pills he starts robbing his school mates,then a mini-mart. However during the latter a propane tank explodes sending Andrew to the hospital. As his father sits by his bed he reveals Andrew's mother passed away that night. But because he was out looking for him he blames Andrew for him not being able to be there for his wife. As he stands over Andrew demanding an apology,Andrew causes a huge explosion to rip the wall out of the hospital room. This draws the attention of the police and the media. Matt is getting a nose bleed and knows something is wrong. He sees the kerfuffle on TV and speeds to the scene. He is just in time to save Andrews father who is thrown to the ground by a hovering and very angry Andrew. Matt and Andrew have a huge showdown over Seattle and it all comes to a disastrous end when Matt is forced to kill Andrew.
The film ends as we find Matt in Tibet. Andrew had said earlier on in the film that they should travel there and they all agreed,except they never made it. This is Matt's way of fulfilling the promise.
If I have to sit through another of these cheaply made,Blair Witch like films,I don't know....burning the disc is too good. The only positives I can say is that it is a kind of a neat idea,on paper,and the special effects were well done. Other than that this wanna-be life like picture is a total washout. As life-like as these films try to be,they really are far off the mark. For instance Andrews father belts him across the face and knocks him off his chair. He comes back up with a grimace but nothing else. Reality?....he should have been crying. But hey,this is Hollywood and REAL reality is a no-no. Just pretend reality. And the moral of the story,that man is not meant to have these powers?Yeah,yeah....they did it better in Star Trek,and long before that.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and extras include pre-viz stuff & a camera test.
All in all another Blair Witch rip off,and done very poorly and uninterestingly at that. The moral is as old as the hills and just as lame. Highly NOT recommended.",1352764800,,3844,4.696296296296296
4726888,5,B005LAIGPA,"Action/adventure, huh?  More like suspense/horror with elements of drama!  Chronicle is one of the craziest films I've seen in a while.  It's about three teenage boys who happen to stumble across telekinesis powers hidden deep in the ground that was apparently brought to earth by aliens (though it was never actually stated but we can only assume since all logic points to alien creatures).  When the teens leaves the hole... let's just say, they'll never be the same again!  The movie takes the familiar theme of having one of the characters walk around holding a home video camera, which reminds me of the Blair Witch Project but a *thousand* times more exciting and suspenseful.

Some of these segments will truly blow your mind.  Everything from money being ejected from a cash register, to a bus way up high in the air flying through a building, to the teenagers learning they have the ability to fly, to windows exploding and police officers and cars flying backwards... everything that makes special effects entertaining is right here.  These powers are also used to trick people such as a lady who comes out of a grocery store and discovers that her vehicle had been parked in another spot, lol.  The boys also use these powers in a negative way such as pushing an impatient driver off the road and over a guardrail.  Not to mention they find out the hard way what happens when they exploit these special powers and believe they're unstoppable.  Let's just say, the consequences will HAVE to be taken into consideration then.

The one thing that sort of bugs me is that the teen whose mother was lying hopelessly sick in bed... shouldn't he have at least *tried* to use his special powers to save her life?  Anyway this same boy has a father (or stepfather) who's an absolute jerk and doesn't mind smacking his son around, and the telekinesis powers are most rewarding during this segment.  Whereas the first 10 minutes are really boring and lousy, the final 20 minutes that show the ultimate confrontation on the streets of Seattle are enough to elevate the overall rating to 5 solid stars.

""Chronicle""
(20th Century Fox, 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a thoughtful and worthy addition to the ""superhero"" movie genre, an indie-ish, low-budget art film exploring what might happen if three average American highschool kids, pumped full of hormones, angst and inexperience, were suddenly given metahuman powers, if comicbook myth met everyday reality. The film is part of the growing number of stories that deconstruct the superhero ideal -- in print, titles like ""Irredeemable,"" ""Marvelman"" and ""Invincible"" come to mind, while in filmland, this falls somewhere between the gratuitous gore of ""Kickass"" and flawed-hero origin stories such as ""Hancock"" or ""Unbreakable.""

I thought the film was well done and intelligent - it's understandable that many Amazon users have given this bad ratings, since they probably aren't used to seeing low-budget films and expect everything to be high-tech and CGI-ed out. But for viewers who are willing to forgive special effects that are roughly equivalent to those of TV's ""Heroes"" series, this film offers a strong, unsettling script and three characters whose actions and reactions are completely believable. I, for one, wouldn't mind a sequel to see where the story goes from here. Not the greatest movie ever, but definitely worth a whirl. Probably really a 4-star movie, but I wanted to help make up for the predictable one-star flame reviews. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1348444800,,1542,5.8533333333333335

I didn't realize it was another installment in what is becoming the ""found footage"" genre. We start off with another high school student wanting to document every second of his day to day routine. The filmmakers find creative ways to keep the ""documenting"" process going to see all angles and all activities. Fortunately, the jittery ""hand held"" camera feel disappears and you find three high school students with super powers. By chance they discover what might be an alien life force undergrown that gives them incredible power.
There are some super fantastic scenes of the kids flying high in the sky as they realize the extent of their powers. Along with incredible powers comes the urge to abuse the powers. A first the tricks are annoying but harmless, ""move"" a shopper's car to completely different parking space all though the power of telekinesis. Needless to say, silly tricks soon have the potential for serious harm.
There is a moral story here of how one would or should use super powers for good or evil. Our three heroes have the potential for good and evil, especially outcast Andrew, who quickly begins to relish in his power. Andrew has a dying mother and a violently abusive father. There is no surprise that his new found skills could turn into an abuse of power.
Now the story follows along until death and mayhem enter the picture. Suddenly, the film loses direction and turns into mayhem and destruction of the city of Seattle. How it gets that far is so off the radar and really a sad conclusion to what was a mildly thoughtful film.",1347235200,,1669,4.699658703071672
4727190,5,B005LAIGPA,"I'm surprised that this film doesn't have higher ratings on Amazon - the critics really loved it (consensus was a rare 85% on RottenTomatoes.com). My husband and I - both avid film buffs - thoroughly enjoyed this creative independent film. What a fresh take on the superhero genre! Loved each of the previously unknown actors and look forward to future work from them. The storytelling was compelling and the plot was not predictable as so many big budget studio films these days are. We gladly followed along at every twist and turn as the story unfolded.

My husband and I actually saw this on Valentine's Day because we were desperate to find an entertaining film and pickings are notoriously slim in January and February. We were resolved not to see the latest studio debacle of a rom com aimed at the occasion (the dreadful ""Valentines Day"" Really, Hollywood? How creative. How will you ever top yourself next year? :-| ) Chronicle turned out to be a wonderful surprise. Perfect for a date night... and just all-around good filmmaking.

4727191,3,B005LAIGPA,"The hand-held camera craze needs to stop, now.  I've yet to see anyone use it in a fashion that made sense and this movie is no exception.  As more than one character rightly observed, ""it's weird,"" and ""it's creepy.""  They also could have added that it isn't natural, logical, or possible to run around with a camera welded to your face.  Even worse, once they've taken the time and the trouble to set up a single viewpoint, supposedly linked to one camera, they then introduce multiple cameras not linked to the one source.  It's as though they figured out too late that they needed many vantage points in order to tell their story.  This brings up the question, why even bother introducing a camera?  It certainly didn't require such an obvious gimmick, especially considering the banality of their so-called chronicle.  Take away the superpower aspect and what you have is a run of the mill After School Special about the evils of bullying.  It also didn't help that the dynamic between the three lead characters was rather an obvious clich.  This gave them absolutely nowhere to go but towards the predictable outcome.  This was little more than a revenge fantasy taken to the extreme.

I will say I didn't absolutely hate it, I wasn't bored or anything, just disappointed by the lack of ingenuity involved.  They could have done much more with the premise than rely on the usual formula for this type of movie.

So these kids... they aren't friends per say, but they grow close due to their powers. In a series of learning to use their powers, the situations escalate until... well. Let's just say the words 'Boss Fight' sum it up well.

The digital fx are, at some times, pretty obvious (even the composite shots look questionable), but it is easy to over-look. The acting is actually pretty good. I mean, no one's getting an Oscar for this film, but the characters are fun to watch: learning to use their powers brings them much closer and they try to support each other...

4727355,3,B005LAIGPA,"I have recently watched three ""found footage"" films, and come to the conclusion that I will probably avoid them in future.  This is a shame, as I am sure the genre is here to stay, like reality TV (which also ought to go away), thanks to its lower production costs.  It's come to seem too gimmicky for my taste.  I haven't seen one yet which, the story being good, wouldn't have been a lot more enjoyable had it been shot as a conventional film.  This film is no exception.  And it's a real shame, because I love the story.  It's particularly timely with the spate of superhero films we've been treated to recently, and it's an interesting twist on the idea of a geeky, introverted, loner kid suddenly gifted with super powers that Stan Lee popularized back in the '60s with Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  This time, the geeky, introverted, loner kid doesn't become the hero, he becomes the villain, and the film very believably depicts why this is.  Andrew Detmer, like Peter Parker, is a shy, unpopular kid in his school, but that's about as far as the similarity goes.  Unlike Peter Parker, Andrew doesn't have a loving, supportive family to hold him up, instill decent values and respect for others into him, and give him a solid moral foundation.  His mother might do this, but the terminal illness she'd battling makes her unable to, and effectively isolates Andrew from the one person who would or could.  Her eventual loss will only reinforce Andrew's sense of the world as a profoundly inhospitable and unfair place.  Andrew's father, an abusive alcoholic, is as far from a loving and supportive parent as he could be, and the torrent of scorn and contempt he pours on the kid only increases Andrew's sense of isolation and alienation.  Combine this with the bullying he undergoes at school, and it's no wonder that, as the film develops, Andrew displays a marked lack of empathy or respect for other people.  When this embittered, isolated boy suddenly finds himself possessing godlike powers, it's no wonder that he feels little restraint in lashing out at what seems to him a cold, uncaring world.  His cousin Matt, and popular fellow student Steve, with happier homes and upbringings, are better grounded morally, and better adjusted socially, and thus better able to resist the corrupting influence of this power.

This is a great story idea, and it builds up to an appropriately dramatic climax.  What a pity then that the makers of this film chose to tell it through the limited lens of ""found footage.""  I dislike FF films because, for starters, they simply don't move as smoothly.  Far too many scenes (no doubt for verisimilitude) are of boring people doing boring things, like the vast majority of home movies.  I also miss the musical score of a traditional film, which, when good, can enormously enhance the drama, suspense, scariness, or humor of any given scene.  Another problem is that the nature of medium makes it harder to identify with the characters; ordinary people always act different when talking to a camera, and so the characters come across different.  FF, therefore, tends to make effective character development much harder.  FF limits the perspective to the single, supposedly amateur camera, which often causes problems in exposition.  And finally, the number one problem with these films is that I have yet to see one that didn't reach a point (usually pretty early in the film at that) where I didn't ask ""why would anyone still be filming at this point?""  Either you have to wonder at people who are ALWAYS filming, no matter how boring, trivial, or mundane the activity they are recording (and most people don't know anyone who does this), or when the action really gets going, and lives are in danger, you wonder why the character behind the camera would still be concerned about continuing the filming when his very life is on the line.  Either way, it doesn't seem very credible, and hurts suspension of disbelief.  I can't think of a single found footage film that I REALLY enjoyed. The style always seems not only to limit the way in which the story can be told, it also seems to magnify problems like bad acting and bad direction. It simply doesn't work for me, and the final result never feels believable in the way that it seems like it should be, and the makers obviously intend it to be.  Even in the case of this movie, the end result was a film whose story I liked, but I probably won't ever care to watch again, whereas if it had been shot as a conventional movie, I'd probably eagerly add it to my video library.",1343952000,2,4567,4.725094577553594

As far as the other characters, the acting is good, the changes in the director's cut were unnecessary so I would recommend watching the Theatrical version if it's your first time seeing the film.

4727425,5,B005LAIGPA,"Like a number of people who have reviewed this movie, I am not a fan of the ""found footage"" film, a genre made popular by THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and several other low budget horror films. It's not the budget I object to, it's what's done with it and CHRONICLE passes that test with flying colors. In fact after watching it you'd be hard pressed to believe that the film was made for only $12 million. Part of that is due to the fact that the film was mostly shot in Cape Town, South Africa. It also uses a cast of unknowns so there are no inflated salaries to contend with. The most significant fact is that CGI has developed to such a sophisticated degree that it can be employed inexpensively by someone who knows what they're doing. CHRONICLE is one of those little films where everything comes together to create a minor masterpiece.

The story is a familiar one. It follows the exploits of three high school friends whose exposure to a mysterious object (it's never explained what it is) causes them to develop super powers such as telekinesis and the ability to fly. One of them, Andrew (Dean DeHaan), has been videotaping all their exploits. This accounts for the title and for the found footage aspect which cleverly disappears 30 minutes into the film. Andrew is like a male version of CARRIE. He is bullied at school and has a terrible home life to come home to. At first the three friends have fun with their new found abilities but things get darker as Andrew's problems mount. He eventually spirals out of control before one of the friends (Alex Russell), who happens to be his cousin, is forced to confront him which results in wrecking most of downtown Seattle.

The performances are one of the best things about CHRONICLE. Since the actors are relatively unknown, their characters come across as real and the dialogue sounds suitably contemporary. Another virtue is that the film runs only 83 minutes so everything is really tight. It's like the B movie of yore where making the most out of the least was the principal challenge the filmmaker faced. After it's initial run the film had grossed $125 million worldwide, a pretty good return on a $12 million dollar investment. To me that's what moviemaking should be all about. The smaller the budget the more creative you have to be and the greater the profit can be as well. At $250 million, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES will be lucky to make 4 times what it cost. Think of how many films like CHRONICLE could have been made for the same amount of money.",1343433600,,2514,4.584444444444444

Although many people complain that there are too many 'found-footage' films being made, i personally like that format because it turns what would be for me just another movie into something very realistic. The found footage genre makes movies look like you're watching things that actually were happening for real. In my opinion, take away that aspect of it and film it the regular way and its just another fictional movie.

A lot of the critics talk about the power corrupting the 3 teens.  I don't agree.  The power just gave them more ways to bring out what they had inside already.

Andrew was in an abusive situation, so he was feeling hurt, helpless, angry, and no way to strike back.  The power gave him a way to do that.  Unfortunately, it takes a LONG time for that emotional trauma to heal, and the power was fueling his anger.

Matt, although he seemed popular and outgoing, we start to see that he has a more introspective nature.  When he sees harm to others, he backs away from causing any of it.  And at the end, you can see how much he loves his cousin and tries to help him, but ultimately he acts to save the ""world"".

Steve I don't feel was affected too much.  He seemed a light-hearted kind of guy, up to pranks and fooling around with stuff, but not intending any harm.  The thing with the car in the parking lot was funny.",1342656000,,1169,4.123893805309734
4727490,5,B005LAIGPA,"Chronicle is a surprisingly entertaining action film that's in the ""found footage"" category (one of the film's characters is the camera man for the whole thing). The rough premise is 3 teenagers stumble across a possibly alien object that mysteriously gives them metal powers. As their powers grow things start to get crazy. I'll leave it at that for plot.

The acting is great considering they're all relatively unknowns as far as I know. Chronicle is by far the most logical found footage film ever in that there's a sensible reason characters would be filming the whole time. The filmmakers also smartly employ a plot device to execute technical shots and get around too many shaky handheld shots (Cloverfield, I like you but you are very guilty of this). The action is really cool and (sort of spoiler) kind of reminds me of Akira at some points.

Overall it's a terrific little gem and I think they could certainly expand the universe with a sequel. Hopefully it will be as well executed as the original.",1342656000,,1009,4.76
4727491,4,B005LAIGPA,"It's a good thing I rented it. This felt more like a visual allegory of regular teens trying to understand the changes still happening to them throughout teenhood. Especially when it comes to abuse and how one can have revenge fantasies.
This deals with a severely bullied teen, his cousin, and his cousin's friend, who befriends him, and what they discover about theirselves after discovering a very strange object underground after a party. The object doesn't get explained, but what's the need? The hints and implications are enough, and so are the powers that come from it. And what the guys do with said powers is at first outrageous. Pulling psychic pranks on people (like floating a teddy bear in front of a little girl, moving a woman's car without touching it, and turning on a leafblower to lift the skirts of a few girls). Then it gets to bigger stuff until an accident happens that questions their abilities and if they can use them for real or if they'll be having problems. What the bullied kid has is major issues stemming from how others see him as a total freak because he loves using his camera. People think he's spying on them, bash his camera (and him, not to mention spit on him), his alcohol father berates him just for locking his door so he won't come in and beat im up, and he seems most comfortable when he's completely alone.
Then their powers develop further with more use, and they try them out, almost harmlessly enough, yet things still go buck wild, especially with a teen-created superstorm (is that ever a good idea to do when it comes to a sharply bullied teenager? I doubt it). Then it gets to be more tragic. More troublesome, to the point of a city-wide showdown between cousin and cousin. What happens almost caused me to shed a tear. Almost. What did it was what happens afterward, something hinted at earlier in the film that hints at further sadness. Main thing I didn't like was how, even though it's apparent the technology to make this kind of film is getting much and much better, there were still a few spots that were obvious CGI (in other words, it didn't look realistic enough and you could tell). Which is sad, to be honest. Thi film had the potential, but I guess not the right budget to further those spots' visuals.",1342483200,,2270,4.57985257985258

4727495,4,B005LAIGPA,"There is a downside to this movie, and I'll address that first, so as to get it out of the way... The high school kids in this movie are portrayed in such a ridiculous, over the top, irritating caricature of every stereotype ever conceived, I almost had to turn it off. The first 20 minutes or so of this movie is a true test of one's patience! I almost feel like the focus groups for this movie must have felt like messing with the producers, and telling them the most outlandish thoughts that popped into their heads.

Okay, that's the bad... now for the good, and there's quite a bit of it, fortunately. After the rough beginning, this movie settles into something unique, gripping, and filled with intelligent special effects that are utterly convincing, as they blend with the ""home video"" style perfectly. This is a great story of friendship, family trials, and why you DO NOT bully other kids!

What I found really awesome about this movie was how clearly it was influenced by the old anime film, ""Akira"". That Japanimation movie is perhaps the most influential of all animes, and its heritage is given a true, respectable homage in ""Chronicle"". It never directly steals, but there are clear references in the movie... if you have your doubts, compare the wardrobe of the main character during his final rampage with that of ""Akira""'s protagonist, late in the film.

As bad as the first 20 minutes of this movie is, the last 20 minutes are superb, more than making up for the rocky start. Any fan of ""Akira"" should investigate ""Chronicle"".",1342224000,2,1546,4.697416974169742

There was zero explanation of where their powers came from or a better explanation of why their noses kept bleeding. How did the one (most powerful) kid die... when in the diner they tried to stab other dude's hand and it bent the fork and they were crashing thru buildings and such?

I enjoyed the additional scenes and character story added. Because I was over the hype I felt I enjoyed the movie even more this time. Then I watched it again the other day, and still loved it. It is such a fresh and amazing concept, the story has heart, thrills, emotion, and depth. Plus if you are a fan of Akira you will see a lot of similar distinctions and elements between the two movie's characters Tetsuo and Andrew. I hear they are gonna butcher and remake Akira to take place in the US, that is a horrible idea. Chronicle has already done that inadvertently, but they did it perfectly.

4727548,5,B005LAIGPA,"Chronicle is the latest in the series of movies using the well-worn storytelling techniques first seen in the Blair Witch Project: it is the smartest use for them yet.

The story of three adolescent boys who stumble upon something that gifts each of them vast telekinetic powers, Chronicle follows them as each of them learns to cope with suddenly being able to do practically anything by force of will alone.

On one level, it is a character study filled with themes that everyone who has ever read a comic book will instantly understand and recognize. On another level, it's a surprisingly good action film--one that doesn't leave you groaning when the action unfolds and things break down.

This is due in large part to a surprisingly well-written script that includes all the expected telekinesis cliches (""Did you do that?"" Look! I can move it, I can move it!"") and adds things to the managerie, as their growing power reveals a growing darkness in one of the characters, leading to a finale that by itself is worth the price of admission.

Using an unsteady camcorder and footage from other cameras as its point of view, Chronicle shares a storytelling method with Cloverfield, the Earlier Blair Witch Project and the ultra-low-budget Paranormal Activity, but Chronicle, with its smarter, tighter writing and direction has more ideas and better executed ideas than you see in its ""found-footage"" predecessors and is simply a smarter and more emotionally satisfying movie.

Watching it will make you believe that the ""found-footage"" movie has finally grown up.",1341705600,,1565,5.050387596899225

I'm not an action movie fan myself, but this was a great mix of drama, action, and most of all...a very creative idea!  I won't give anything away that's not in the previews, but these three boys (one of whom is super popular/fun (Nick Cannon) and one who is a trying to change, and the star who is backwards and from an abusive home) find this...um...this thing. This thing changes them and they find they have these powers that allow them to move things with their minds!

One of my favorite things about Chronicle is that it doesn't rush the FUN PART! If you could move things with your mind, what would you do for fun?? Well, these guys come up with some really great ideas of how to have fun with this power, and to me it's the best part of the movie! Then things start to become more serious....plus there is that nasty abusive father to deal with....

I honestly think if you have even the slightest interest in Chronicle, you should watch it. Like I mentioned, I don't do action movies like King Kong or war movies..anything with big chase scenes (yawn) or lots of damage being done. I LOVED CHRONICLE!!

4727550,1,B005LAIGPA,"I like super hero movies, and after reading the synopsis on the movie, thought it may have potential.  WRONG!  First of all, the filming was done in the style of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"".  Almost the entire movie was jumpy.  The actual story line was plausible but unfortunately the script was a total failure.  The little bit of action in the movie was a total failure as well, though I think some of that may have been due to the filming style.

4727551,4,B005LAIGPA,"Don't worry, this review is completely spoiler-free!

Chronicle basically is a story about three high school students who accidently gain the power of telekinesis.
Andrew, the main character, comes from a broken home and is bullied at school. To cope with his torment he decides to document his life, wich also creates a barrier between him and the world around him.
Matt is a laid-back philosopher who is not only Andrews cousin, but also his only friend.
Last but not least there is Steve. He is a populer student, who plans to work in politics.
At first Steve doesn't really have much to do with Andrew or Matt. Their friendship strengthens however, as they learn how to train their abilities and find out how much is possible, such as moving cars or even flying. It starts out as fun and games when Andrew suddenly causes a car crash, putting a man in the hospital. From this point on things tend to get out of hand, up to a disastrous point of no return.

The entire movie is filmed in the found-footage-style. Even though this type of filming was oftenly used in the last couple of years, Chronicle manages to give it a new twist and keep it interesting.
Not only is the POV-Camera a main instrument to the plot it also is needed to underline Andrews character. The most innovative aspect is the mixture between the superpowers and the camera handling. As Andrew becomes more secure with his telekinesis he learns to control the camera, wich allows clean pan shots and gliding camera movements without disrupting the authenticity.

Like most superhero movies, this is a movie for a middle-aged audience. It is an especially interesting movie for anybody who has ever wondered what it would be like to be able to fly or move objects with their minds. The movie shows this in such a fun to watch and authentic manner, you wouldn't doubt the logic of bending the rules of physics for a second.

Naturally there are a couple of downsides to the movie. At the end of the movie, for example, it felt like the dedication to the POV-style coudln't keep up with the fast-paced action scenes. Also there is a subplot or two that seemed to be unnecessary, but all in all it is an entertaining movie I definetly recommend watching.",1341619200,,2225,4.6395939086294415

4727666,1,B005LAIGPA,I liked the commercials for the movie but when I actually saw it there was really nothing to it. I was bored stiff!,1341360000,3,115,4.043478260869565
4727667,5,B005LAIGPA,"With a minimalist poster that indicates only the setting (Seattle), the film's title, mysterious figures in the sky, a tag line ""what are you capable of?"", a Facebook page and Twitter hashtag and trailer that appears to show everything but gives away nothing (itself a sly commentary on the current trend in trailers to show everything AND give away pretty much everything) the marketing of Chronicle felt very much like a product of the 21st century, with the requisite dose of virality built in. Whether this was a product of design (I like to think it was) or necessity, as the film's cast s made up of relatively unknown, mostly TV actors doesn't really matter as it was more than enough to get me to see it the first chance I had (a weekday morning in a totally empty cinema) and, more especially, because the marketing under promised a film that very much over delivers (to be clear, this is a good, and increasingly rare, thing).

This stands in stark contrast to David Fincher's take on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo which also had a great trailer (though one that was calculated with scientific precision to gratify fans of the novel while still inveigling the uninitiated), a coolly explicit poster and a title sequence that probably cost more than the entire budget of the Swedish version of the film but whose cast was populated with wall-to-wall famous people (I include Rooney Mara in this though she has limited credits, the hype around her has been...excessive) to the point that even the extras look familiar - seriously, Joel Kinnaman from the AMC show The Killing (who would have been the most famous guy in Chronicle were he in it) has a minor part of a colleague of Daniel Craig's Blomkvist (I don't think he even has a line). However, for all it promised the film, though technically beautiful and somehow able to breathe fresh life into pretty stale material, ultimately felt sterile and over-produced (and WTF was Daniel Craig doing with his glasses? No one does that. No one.) But I digress...

As others have observed many of these aspects connect Chronicle to Cloverfield (hey, they both even start with the letter ""C"" and have cast members who appeared in True Blood!) further emphasized by the found footage style the film is shot in (a la Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, et al). People complain that there's been a glut of found footage films (especially in the horror genre) and some found it gratuitous and/or pointless in Chronicle. I'm inclined to disagree and would in fact argue that it is a crucial aspect of the film and one that connects it to another great, closely related work of pop culture: Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross' graphic novel, Marvels.

Marvels retells the history of the major storylines of the superheroes in the Marvel Universe (i.e. Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Avengers, X-Men, etc.) from the perspective of normal human beings who view these beings of power almost as gods walking the earth. And like the gods of Greek mythology they are sometimes benevolent, sometimes fickle and often prone to hubris. This shift in perspective and the resulting scope of storytelling is what makes Marvels great and is likewise key to Chronicle's success.

Using the found footage mode Chronicle tells the story of (self) isolated teenager Andrew Detmer (Dane Dehaan) who has recently acquired a video camera to document his life to the nth degree (a not unrealistic proposition given the era of compulsive self-documentation we live in) including the mundane (breakfast), the depressing (bullying at his high-school) and the tragic (abuse at the hands of his alcoholic father while his mother suffers in the background, bed-ridden and dying of an unnamed illness). Bereft of any friends the only levity in Andrew's life comes during his daily ride to school with his slacker, philosophy quoting older cousin Matt (Alex Russell). Alex convinces Andrew to join him that weekend at a rave in a derelict building out in the woods. Matt's desire to attend the party is at least partially motivated by the fact that Casey (Ashley Hinshaw) will be there. She is and turns out to be a videographer herself (covering every aspect of her life for her blog) and we have some nice moments of the watchers watching each other (and so who's watching them (read: us) etc.). Later in the evening Matt and a friend the popular Steve (a charismatic Michael B. Jordan) rope Andrew into an adventure deeper in the woods, where they've discovered a hole that leads to a cave and in the cave a object that gives off a brilliant, blinding light... So as to avoid spoilers I'm not going to give too much more away. Suffice it to say that whatever is in the cave grants Andrew, Matt and Steve superhuman powers and the film shifts gears from teen angst (melo) drama to teen angst (melo) drama super-charged with sci-fi as the three discover how to use their powers and, for the first time in his life Andrew has real friends, bound together as they are by their differences from everyone else - and then things go horribly wrong.

The people who made Chronicle, namely director Josh Trank (Spike TV's The Kill Point) and screenwriter Max Landis (uh, John Landis' son) don't just have a keen sense of genre, as they successfully blend several together here, but also clearly know their stuff when it comes to comic books, demonstrated by how tightly pack the film is with elements from the several major comic book storylines (power vs. responsibility from Spider-Man, social isolation from X-Men, anger management from The Hulk, etc.). It's skillfully and subtly done, this isn't some hat-tip to geeky comic book fanboys. Rather, all the elements are blended into a very satisfying whole. It treats comic books as a source of pop-culture reference and inspiration much in the way literature, theatre, art and other films have been used in cinema to date - does this mean we're moving into a post comic book era? In the sense that comics can finally be seen as an artistic medium in their own right? (I like to think so).

At 84 minutes Chronicle is snappy and, as previously noted, very skillfully made. The special effects work is seamlessly integrated into the visuals and, given the found footage style feel very realistic until the characters' powers grow to epic levels at which point they feel pretty scary and we're made to feel very human, very...small (What am I capable of? I'm just going to sit here and watch the movie...thanks). Consequently Chronicle succeeds where other films that have tread similar subject matter haven't, films such as Unbreakable (too much insider baseball), Hancock (neither funny enough nor dark enough) and even Watchmen (too reverential to it's source material).",1341273600,,6731,4.863993025283348

4727765,4,B005LAIGPA,"Chronicle has your average young superhero movie origin formula, however they play it off with much better effect. The story revolves around three highschool kids that find this meteor or something underground and it bestows them with telekenesis. Two of the kids want to keep it as a little hobby they do with each other while one of them, after going through years of abuse, wants to use his powers for his own purposes.

Chronicle's age old story was told really well, where the villian Andrew here is really fleshed out well as a sympathetic character, making his downfall that more tragic. RedLetterMedia pointed out that this whole story is essentially the same as the Star Wars prequels and yet it tells the story with much more conviction and excitment in less than 90 minutes, suck on that Lucas indeed. Alex (I think?) is Andrew's more popular cousin who tries to help Andrew out with his social situation, and Steve is the charismatic school president who happens to be with them when they discover the rock, all of them seemed stereotypical but it was the little flourishes here and there that made their characters more convicing than they should've been.

The only real complaint I have though about Chronicle (and everyone else has covered it there and back again) is the found-footage style, it didn't really seem necessary to tell the story and it wasn't consistent. The first scene Andrew explains to his drunk dad that he bought a camera and is recording his dad being locked in his room, so what's he going to do with the camera, send it to the police? No, he's going to carry it around with him everywhere, recording everything. Why? Is he so lonely that he films himself? I've never heard of people doing that before. Also Alex's love interest happened to be a blog personality online that also happens to film everything, very coincidential for a movie that plays itself out for realism. Then near the end there's a few camera shots like when Alex opens his eyes after laying down with the police around him, there was no camera filming that, so they didn't even keep the 'found footage' style consistent.

What they should've done instead was pick and choose what to film 'found footage' like and what not to, like when Andrew pushes the car into the river there's no reason he would've grabbed the camera in real life, so scenes like that just film them naturally, it's not a big deal if it's not all completely found footage. Some parts were interestingly shot too, like the final 'confrontation' was all shot through onlooker's cell phones or cameras, it was definately innovative and looked realistic, but I wanted a little more. So again, cut to some people's camera persepctive then cut back to the action, well I don't know, it was still damn good and I'm rambling again.

Anyways Chronicle was entertaining the entire way through which is a gem of it's own, not one second I would say was filler. All the 'hataz' that say it was dumb teenage angst crap it's not, teen agnst is kids with first world problems brooding about getting grounded or something, Andrew had real problems and issues. And for the people saying it was slow: seriously?

Its the story of a somewhat loner in high school whose life is forever changed when him and his friends find supernatural abilities.

4727925,3,B005LAIGPA,"What would you do if you suddenly had powers that no one else had except two friends? Would you use those powers for good or abuse them? Such becomes the question by the end of the film CHRONICLE.

Andy Dettmer (Dane DeHaan) is the typical high school loser in the midst of his senior year. Abused by his father, he chooses to buy a camcorder and shoot everything that happens in his life including the attacks by his dad. Of course walking around all the time with a camera on your shoulder does little to make him any more popular at school.

The only friend Andy has in his life is his popular cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell). Matt gets along with everyone and though he and Andy haven't chummed around for a while, he still tries to involve him. The latest event he talks him into is going to a rave on the outskirts of town. There Andy discovers that the popular kid in school, Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) actually knows who he is from their time in school together and because he's friends with Matt.

The three of them leave the rave when Matt finds something, a hole in the ground nearby that seems fairly deep. They do a little investigating and find a glowing crystal deep in the ground that seems to have tendrils moving inside of it. As they touch the crystal the camera jerks around and suddenly it's the next day. To their surprise they discover that they have telekinetic powers now.

Their powers progress and where they first start off doing goofy things like making baseballs sway when tossed to hit one another ala JACKASS, they soon discover that by careful manipulation they can fly. Apparently none of them has read or seen Spider-man or they would realize that with great power comes great responsibility.

As the film progresses, we watch Andy's slow collapse. While he has this enormous power, perhaps more so than his two friends, his fragile mind can't handle it when coupled with the abuse he's endured by both his father and the kids at school. He becomes a time bomb waiting to be unleashed and when he does there is no telling what will happen next.

As I watched this film I was reminded of AKIRA, the classic Japanese animated film where a youngster suddenly gains power and has the potential to destroy the world. But instead of a film that spends most of its time showing the main character overflowing with power, this movie tends to uncoil slowly as we watch these characters go from normal teens to potential monsters. You can feel nothing but sympathy for Andy after the physical and mental beatings he endures and at the same time fear him in what he becomes.

The effects are well done and make the whole concept believable. The joy that these three have when they test out their powers makes for moments that are amusing and then fearful. Best of all they seem real.

One note for those who are not fans of the genre. The film is another of those hand held camera movies where the camera jumps most of the time like BLAIR WITCH or CLOVERFIELD. But as Andy's powers increase he begins to stop holding the camera and guide it with his mind instead offering a more fluid movement to the scenes, making the camera motion almost a character as well.

Some will hate this movie while others will love it but on the whole I think it falls into that medium area of being a good movie that you won't watch over and over again. It is worth seeing at least once, but as for multiple viewings I just don't see it happening. Well made, well acted, well directed, but ultimately just a fun film for the moment.",1339977600,,3550,4.491472868217055

4727967,4,B005LAIGPA,"A young troubled high school teen named Andrew buys a video camera and commences to filming his everyday life from his drunk dad, to his friends, to his high school day consisting of being picked on and being told not to film the cheerleaders. It seems his life is quite hopeless and dreary until he and his two friends discover a cave, go exploring in it and find some strange glowing rock formation that knocks them all and the camera out.

Once the camera is back on they appear to be fine but its quickly obvious they each have some kind of super power thanks to said glowing rocks. At first its just moving objects with their minds and having fun but if it stopped at that it would be a boring movie. As expected they start to want to do more with their new found gifts, namely Andrew who develops a taste for using it for the wrong reasons.

Since this is all filmed from Andrew's camera it tries to lend a sense of realism much like ""Cloverfield"" attempted to with the monster movie genre. ""Chronicle"" does have some impressive visuals, decent story that feels a little real life and some good acting as it really just focuses on the main 3 friends with other actors only making occasional appearances.

4727969,4,B005LAIGPA,"This is a the tale of an introverted senior in high school named Andrew. His mother is bed ridden and dying and his abusive stepfather is on disability and grieving that his wife will die soon and that he is no longer useful to society. To make it worse a lot of people in high school bully Andrew or just plain out verbally abuse him. Even his cousin doesn't want to be around him that much and tolerates his presence.

That all changes when they stumble upon some alien technology which bonds the two cousins (as well as another friend of the tolerant cousin) and gives the three of them colossal telekinetic powers. Andrew's rage at being mistreated boils up and comes out gradually with abuse until he's literally out of control.

On a basic level it's a fun tale about the loser kid getting revenge on those who wronged him horribly but on a deeper level it's about how we sometimes create the monsters around us. It also reminds me of some relatively recent moments in our history in which certain people who were mistreated turn violently on those who persecuted them.

Almost all of the movie scenes are told through Andrew's beloved camera or other video recording devices. It is technically known as found footage.

The film budget was only $15M but it made over $126M at the Box Office. A sequel is being planned.

Three teens (Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan) fall in a hole. It is too bad they did not stay there. Of course if they had we wouldn't have much of a movie I guess, such that it is. Then came the proverbial powers. It's not so bad watching them have to struggle with their newfound abilities; but having to watch it on a phony homemade movie genre is more than one can take.

4727975,5,B005LAIGPA,"Chronicle is a very dark, superhero-style film. The dark part of the film is Andrew's life, which is filled with abuse from school bullies and even his father; all of the abuse is presented vividly. Don't get me wrong, the film has some exhilaratingly fun scenes like when they're  flying and narrowly escape death or when they're playing around with their powers in public. I personally thought the film's ending was epic and wonderfully shot. The pacing was also very fast in my opinion. My only complaint is how fast Andrew turns into a villain and starts getting revenge; but it's a very minor complaint and it's actually awesome when he finally snaps. The film uniquely spins the found footage genre for the better. Ultimately, it's unique, it's well acted, it's dark, and it's entertaining. Definitely worth the $12.99 I paid.

The penultimate version I've screened would be '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>'. Sadly, the drecks are too numerous to count. This flick falls somewhere in between.

Appreciated the writers excluding the logic of the situation. There isn't anything that could resemble a plausible explanation, so, like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie/dp/B00005K3NR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie</a>', the story is all that matters.

Tells the tale of three friends who are transformed by a mysterious crystal. Having been changed, they begin to realize that they have extraordinary comic book-like superpowers. Psychokinesis that begins with the minor ability to move small objects quickly escalating to near mystical feats of prowess, culminating in the ability to fly.

Matt - the athlete, Steve - the popular student, and Andrew - the outcast.

As they accept their new reality, the trio begin to explore their powers with exuberance, laughter, and light-hearted hijinks you expect of teenagers - lifting a girl's dress and the like. However, a close call where an innocent nearly dies has Matt and Steve making ""a rule"" that they have to accept responsibility for their actions; echoing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stan-Lee/dp/160549030X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stan Lee</a>&nbsp;refrain that with great power comes great responsibility.

But outsider Andrew quietly defies the group agreement, he doesn't feel the need to contain and hide. In fact, he's of the mindset that they should personally benefit from their awesome gifts. Beginning with his abusive father - by breaking every bone in his body. The abused kid begins to emotionally and psychologically detach from any moral restraint. Having spent his entire life being the object of humiliation and torment - the effects of having such incredible power begins to take a toll on his sense of morality and even his sanity. And having two popular kids giving him defined boundaries isn't what he wants to hear. Soon, he begins to believe himself beyond his own humanity, a god amongst ants.

Enjoyable exploration of the common theme in comic books: What would you do if you *really* had superpowers?

So, you discover you have super powers, and you decide to ""have fun"" using them in public? Uh, yea, exactly. It's beyond stupid. Out of all three of them, nobody said ""Hey, we better keep this hidden from, oh, I don't know, EVERYONE, lest we end up locked up in an underground lab for life for study.""

I would have liked to have seen the story developed a bit more as far as what may have given this ability. Maybe some hints as to what was under the ground or where it came from. The police, I figured, were investigating the site with the hole, but we never hear anything. I suspected the kids would have been tracked down at some point before the last 15 or so minutes of movie. Did nobody else really know what's under ground?

As far as the ending, I would have rather it end another way. As it is. *spoiler. stop here if you haven't seen it* his alcoholic father lives, rescued by the remaining guy, who kills the angry one and gets the vacation to the Himalayas. Poor young guy gets picked on the entire movie, beat up by his dad, goes a little psycho, then gets killed. What an ending for him. The older cousin who seemed to have a little more sense, since, he first came up with the idea of having rules, I suppose he deserved to live for being the more responsible one?

After it all, it seemed like a nice film. The first half was very unequal in terms of a story or action compared to the last half. I really don't see even teenagers today being that stupid after getting special powers. Maybe that's the purpose of the movie, to set a good example for today's youth, as so many movies have done in the past.",1339632000,2,1752,4.208333333333333

The ""found footage"" camera work is infuriating - jerking constantly, like Blair Witch and Cloverfield - and the ending fizzles unconvincingly.

I was hoping the film would explore subjects like how people with superpowers would deal with it, but that was wishful thinking. The story needed to be much deeper than this. Where is the US government? Other governments? One of the characters does turn evil, but the way it's done is quite poor. He was bullied, gets a mean scowl on his face and starts destroying buildings. That's it?

This is not a movie for people who have been in the working world for a few years. It's great for teenagers, but it's a ridiculous movie that gets really pretentious and silly at the very end. It's a movie written from the perspective of a person that grew up in a well-off area, living a shallow party lifestyle, and it's fairly obvious.

4728088,5,B005LAIGPA,"My husband brought this movie home, and while the premise sounded intriguing, I was a bit disappointed to hear that Chronicle might be one of those manically videotaped Blair Witch Project type of film.

Yes, the movie does have handheld camera elements, but after the first twenty minutes, the camera not only becomes integral to the storytelling...but also the theme (observing and analyzing life rather than truly living it).

Anyway, we just got done watching Chronicle and to call it ""gripping"" almost seems like a cliche...but it's an apt description.

I won't go over plot details because others have done so. What surprised and thrilled me about this movie (that has now bumped&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joy-Ride/dp/B0002WT4OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joy Ride</a>&nbsp;out of my ""favorite movie"" spot) is:

1. The acting. Totally believable high school dudes with distinct personalities. And Andrew's background sets the stage for what happens when a marginalized, bullied and abused kid finally gets the power to fight back.

2. Special effects. For me, special effects have to SUPPORT a story for me to like it...not just be there to try to wow the crowd. I have no idea how they filmed the amazing flying stuff, but it was just...CRAZY. Crazy good. There were times--I kid you not--when I became aware that my mouth was hanging open.

3. Intense plot that escalates. Just when you think it can't get worse...it does. I reached out for my husband's hand more than once...and squeezed the living daylights out of it. My heart still feels like it's trying to calm down from the experience (and it's been about 20 minutes since it was over!)

4. The ending. It rocked. Totally satisfying.

Like Joyride, there's some funny parts...at first (especially when they're in the toy store messing around with their new-found ""gifts""). There's some emotional roller-coaster stuff going on as well, with Andrew's home life. So combining the emotional range of this film with the special effects, acting and satisfying ending...

Wait. Are you still here? For crying out loud, you should be watching Chronicle already! ;o)

It's simple; they accidently discover a subterranean object that makes then develop the power of gods...

What follows is a good movie depicting the life and troubles of three teenagers who slowly become omnipotent. The special effects are well done and the story line is also good. I enjoyed the movie and the acting was not bad at all.

I was not so crazy about the found-footage concept that this movie is based on but at least the director had the sense not to film the movie in the violent and eye jerking camera motions of many of the other found-footage movies released in the last few years. There is a little of that but it only happens on occasion and it is not the continuous and nauseating headache style of jerky camera that have seen in the past. This story and plot line was actually good enough that it might have made a better movie if filmed in the normal movie mode.

Sure I'm 47 but I still bear the scars that those few short years left on my emotional landscape. These days 3 years go by pretty quick but 3 years in high school took forever! This movie is arguably targeted toward teenagers but I went anyway. I generally do my best to forget I was ever a teenager and I avoid such movies but if you throw in some telekinesis, I'll go. I just ordered the DVD since I want to see it again without destroying my immortal soul by getting it, shall we say, some other way. I also hope to see some deleted scenes and maybe some commentary from the producers. I crossed my fingers and placed the order.

Ok. Got the DVD. It has some features like a rough CGI outline of some flight scenes and the major battle. It has a couple rehearsals of some of a few scenes with different actors. It doesn't have any commentary from the director though. I'll leave my review at 4 stars. If it had a commentary I'd give it 5.",1338940800,,1090,4.3431372549019605

That movie has the (very) rare quality to seem 'real'/'true' despite its 'strong fantasy side' (great goal!). The young actors performs very well and special effect for a low budget movie are almost perfect [My only doubt is (I try to not to anticipate nothing) when these teens are up to see something important, this is the only scenery/visually weak part].
It underlines in a fantasy-way several problems like: teen agers bullys, the difficulties in relationships, loneliness, illness, the high schools that looks inadequate to fit the teens problems, the big contrast between many male teen agers and the father.

My 12-yr old daughter didn't make it past the first 7 minutes so any preteens who feel the emotions very deeply may not be able to handle what happens in the movie or the relationship between Andrew and his father, mother, or some of the school bullies later on.

The movie goes into some deep emotions and you ride the roller-coaster with the main character Andrew: you feel sorry for him, hate the mean people surrounding hime, rejoice when he has friends, laugh at the 'learn the powers' antics, and are bewildered and upset when he abuses his new-found powers.

My son wanted any other teens (and parents) to know that this is a good movie with a good message but it is sad.  As a parent, I'd say this is one to watch together and be wary of any teens/kids who (like my daughter) couldn't handle the difficult emotional elements.

A teenager, who decides to film everything in his life, uncovers a mysterious glowing orb with his friends that gives them strange new powers.

Is it any good?

With great power comes great responsibility! Ok sure, maybe that was Spiderman, but the same can be said for any nerdy kid who suddenly discovers special powers. So, imagine Spiderman got his powers and let them get to his head? The concept of Chronicle is rather simple and not unique, but the character arc had me hooked. Just how bad can this guy get? Ultimately, the film lives and dies by the camera techniques (or gimmick) employed for the entire duration of the film. Every shot in the film is a home video, much in the vein of `Cloverfield'. In some cases it works great, but there are quite a few times throughout the film which took you out of the `movie', as you became more interested in why would he would be filming this, or what camera is getting these shots? Overall, solid performances all around for a relatively unknown cast, great pacing, great action makes for a genially enjoyable film.

Best bit?

A fight between two friends ends up on top of the Seattle space needle!

4728206,3,B005LAIGPA,"This film takes a while to get started and unfortunately the first 40 minutes or so are largely comprised of setting up generic high school characters and watching them behave the way that screenwriters in their 30s think high school students behave. The dialog is pretty risable and you can watch the first 30 minutes with the sound off and still know exactly what's happening.

The three teenagers are: a misunderstood emo-type with a bad home life, a philosophical type who quotes texts, and a popular jock (also the token black guy and yes, he does get killed first). They're like, totally, you know like whoa in their dialog except for like the philosophical stuff that grates as badly as Rick Santorum at a Lady Gaga concert.

Unfortunately, they opt for the ""found footage"" film model which almost never works even in the hands of people such as J J Abrams. This filming gimmick gets in the way of the story since every scene has to invent a reason why somebody is filming it. As a classic revenge-slash-superhero gone bad set-up, the use of ""found footage"" is Kryptonite to letting the plot and characters develop.

On the plus side, the special effects are really excellent for a $12mm movie (filmed in South Africa, interestingly enough) - there are more visuals in the last 30 minutes than in most $200mm summer blockbusters. The best sequence is reminiscent of the Universal Orlando ride ""The Amazing Adventures of Spiderman"" and is really gripping to watch and easily the strongest part of the film. It's also the one area where the point-of-view shots work very well.

Dane DeHaan is the best actor in the group as he slowly descends in craziness. Unfortunately he doesn't have much to work with since the film's dialog eventually becomes ""I'm stronger than you!"", ""Don't make stop you!"" and lines that you wouldn't see in speech bubbles in any respectable comic.

Besides being an immensely entertaining film (especially the first and last thirds), Chronicle pushes the medium forward in ways that haven't been explored before. Most of this comes from the use of camera execution. Due to his powers, Andrew can levitate the camera from which we are viewing him, therefore allowing for smooth movement that covers a wider amount of space than before possible. And best of all it fits with the film's internal logic! Use of multiple camera sources (in the last third) create an ever changing and epic capture of a huge event (no spoilers) and every angle is covered.
Even better, the film has quality acting from all of the leads, who are always convincing in their roles. The script is tight, and the dialogue is pitch perfect, but some of the characterization is a little shallow and underdeveloped. However this does not hurt the film in any truly noticeable way, and Chronicle provides a refreshing look at superhero and POV films. 9/10 or 5/5",1337731200,,1111,4.791666666666667

My biggest beef with this movie is that it offers a very narrow range of characters to relate to: You have the good looking political type, the in-between jock and nice guy type and the whiner sissy baby type, it was this last type that really alienated me as a viewer.

Chronicle seemingly starts off as a drama about a kid in a Seattle high school that really doesn't fit in and progressed to a movie about finding that superpower that we've all dreamed about when we were kids. Okay, okay....that power we still dream about even as adults! To make things interesting this kid happens to be with his popular-on-campus cousin and one of his cousin's buddies when they stumble upon an object that grants them telekinetic abilities. The result is a sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic and a lot of times action filled movie that I pretty much enjoyed from start to finish.

There has been no shortage of hand-held camera and found-footage films to come out in the past few years, and Chronicle adds to that list. Chronicle did the hand-held thing quite well without a lot of shaky footage and ""dropped the camera"" shots. But I still never got the point as to why the director chose the hand-held format versus presenting a cleanly produced film. I guess in this day and age of YouTube everything it just seemed like the ""in"" thing to do.

Fortunately, I thought that the hand-held silliness was made up for by a uniquely written script by Max Landis (son of Writer/Director vet John Landis). And the mostly TV actor cast of three performed their roles with believability and emotion.

While the final 15 minutes of this short 90 minute film were a little offsetting and not quite as believable, I'd still recommend this movie to any fan of the superhero genre. And the door has been left wide open for a decent sequel that could continue into a saga of how to become a superhero.

It was also a story that went deep into what might happen to people if they were suddenly given god-like power over others and over natural laws like gravity. The movie chronicles what happens to the three boys who have vastly different personalities and lives.

I don't want to give too much away by telling more of the story than I have, but it was really well done. The acting was excellent, the script really good, the special effects fantastic. I was entertained throughout.

The only negatives were that the shaky camera style was a bit difficult to watch at times, and the story seemed to move slowly in the beginning of the movie. However that beginning was needed so we would get to know the characters and their situations well.

Parents should know that there's some intense violence.

4728557,2,B005LAIGPA,"""Chronicle"" is a frustrating film to review.

I know the filmmakers were trying something new with the comic\superhero film genre, but the found-footage\hand-held camera work, actually, hurts the film. It's annoying to watch, especially, with the quick-cut editing.

One of the major problems is that found-footage films barely have well-developed characters and tell awkward, rushed plots. The structure is definitely, not normal film structure.

The first half of the film, while showing some nice special effects, is a total bore and a mess. Too many shots and short scenes of the teens playing around with their powers, for example.

It's not until the second-half of the film, that the viewer is finally given a ""plot"" and a developed character (although, not well-rounded), in the form of a cliched protagonist-turned-antagonist. However, this was certainly, the best part of the film, including the rather action-packed 10 min ending.

The film had potential to be something original and fresh, but the found-footage aspect is what ruins the experience, as well as the lack of a compelling story.

It wouldve been interesting if the hole in the ground and it's origins were explored more, as well as developing the antagonist plot, much earlier.

Another problem is that all the characters seem to be capable of having the same powers and of course, one of them takes their power to the extreme and become the villian of three. The fact they all share the same powers, means there's no chance to create characters with distinctive superpowers (this is no ""Fantastic Three"").

For comicbook fans and sci-fi films, ""Chronicle"" is a film with ideas that barely add-up to anything great. Some good action\special effects sequences, overshadowed by the lack of a compelling story and interesting characters.

 If the filmmakers ditched the found-footage concept and put more effort into the script\story, ""Chronicle"" couldve been something new in a sea of established comicbook films.",1337472000,5,1986,5.256329113924051

  I was surprised by how much my wife and I both liked this film. It brings to mind Attack the Block and Super 8, but surpasses both of those in depth of character, script, humor and special effects. The special effects are astounding. But the depth of character surpasses the kitsch that most special effects really are, in this age of CGI and other computer generated marvels. We found ourselves really liking and caring about the main character, a quiet, smart, nerdy kid who is bullied both at home and at school. His creative outlet is amateur filming, which is a theme that runs through the movie and which lends itself very well to the idea of an Indy produced, hand-held camera that gives an otherwise unbelievable film its cinema verite quality. This serves to make the special effects even more memorable and believable, since the boys' astounding powers are so slowly developed; they are understated and minimized at first. Great script, beautiful characterizations, heartfelt sympathy for teens, the whole enlivened by humorous and believable teenage testosterone ... and some real magic. I had some very minor issues with the film, but this did not prevent me -- and my wife, who usually can't sit through a real sci-fi film -- from enjoying this nearly perfectly realized film.

I'm just going take a moment to debate the argument of those who criticize this movie.

Firstly, this movie is being mistaken for a superhero flick, which in fact it definitely isn't. It's annoying to see people (who are fixated with the standard comic book template) telling me how much more fun x-men is.

No this is not the rise and fall of heroes or villains, rather a much more complex story that is probably more like the adult interpretations we find in Japanese mangas like 'akira'.

It's the rise and fall of friendship, a group of kids who are bestowed tremendous power without limits. It triggers the imagination in a completely Different way. Nobody puts on a cape here. What would you do? And as it progresses it reveals the very realistic conclusion. An inner struggle to contain what is spinning out of control. The frustration of his cousin to contain the 'big secret' and the demise of our main character as he begins to take on a superiority complex.

It unravels in a very realistic and thought provoking way. And the 'found footage' perspective helps to distinguish this from marvel comics etc. Overall I found this incredibly refreshing.",1337299200,,1261,4.76605504587156

I know; it doesn't exactly sound like something that would work.  But thanks the deft hand of director Josh Tank, and a superb cast, CHRONICLE manages to pull it off admirably.

The story isn't complex: three high schoolers (loner Andrew, popular Steve, partier Matt) stumble upon a strange glowing thing underground.  They come away from it with powers.  Things spiral out of control.  You can predict what happens; the focus here is upon how it's captured.  The story lends itself to breaking away from the typical ""one of the characters shoots the whole movie"" trope (in some creative, and some annoying, ways), and the special effects, though at first hokey, become more and more awe-inspiring.  The acting from the three leads (Dane DeHaan, Michael B. Jordon, and Alex Russell, respectively) is above-par; very naturalistic, very organic.  You can feel them bonding, having a typically teenage time discovering what all they can do.  This is where CHRONICLE is at its best: three friends learning about themselves and each other, set against some unnerving superpowers.

The film becomes a bit more typical in its final act; at first, this is okay--it's not as fun as the third two-thirds, but it's impressively rendered.  Then it just sort of dissolves.  That's CHRONICLE'S biggest flaw--it ultimately succumbs to the conventions it has tried so hard to flaunt.  When it works, it's very impressive (and I'm skeptical of the whole ""shaky cam/found footage"" genre; in fact, this is the first one I've enjoyed in a long time).

In my opinion,much credit has to be given to filmmakers Josh Trank and Max Landis for coming up with a premise that didn't sound so exciting(a superhero-like film wrapped in a teen drama in the ""found footage"" format).But it worked, given the performances of the 3 boys(notably Dane DeHaan and Michael B.

Ok with that out of the way this is probably the best movie I've seen that uses the found footage technic. As you will see after the fun begins there power assist the camera at times which makes you not notice the feel of found footage as much.

This movie is about one troubled teen that starts videoing he's life. After meeting up with one of the popular kids at his high school and his cousin they investigate a strange hole in the earth in which they find a strange rock. This is where the adventure starts they discover that they now have certain powers which get stronger over the corse of using them. They have fun testing these powers out until one of the teens goes to far then things get a little out of hand....

The movie was very short.  I think it was even under 90 minutes.  Might have only been 84 minutes, if I remember correctly.  I tend to like shorter movies (if they're not blockbusters), so I didn't have a problem with that.  Just pointing it out.

Where to start! This was AWESOME! We loved Chronicle. It is everything the super hero movies strive to be. In most super hero movies I wish they spent more time on the hero learning his new abilities. That was one of the things I loved about Chronicle. Wait, I digress; let's start at the beginning. Andrew is the kid in school you hope at least has a better life at home. He is constantly beat up at school and walks around behind a camera documenting the world around him. Usually his videos end up with his camera falling as someone punches or hits him. Poor kid has it just as bad at home. His father sucks too. Things appear to be very hard in Andew's home and dad either drinks because life is hard or Dad drinks because he is a tool but either way dad drinks and his poor mother is sick in bed, on oxygen and dying.

One day after dad comes in and beats him, Andrew joins his friend Matt at a party.  After fighting with his friend he is lead to a hole in the ground by another guy Steve. Steve is very popular and wants Andrew to film this hole so that everyone can see it. They head down and are ""zapped"" by something. We never do find out what it is. Obviously something extraterrestrial.

The next thing you know these guys have super powers of the coolest kind. The best parts of the movie is of them honing in on their powers.  They are having fun and enjoying their new found fame and friendship. Andrew is finally part of a group but then things change for the worse.

This is a great movie where the actors are fantastic in their roles. The dialogue is real and made me feel like I was watching reality TV as we are seeing a lot in the beginning through the eyes of Andew's camera.

Sadly it's nowhere near as fun, in fact, in the fun department, it's miles and miles behind.

The film is taken from the video camera of Andrew (DeHaan, True Blood), a lonely, bored and abused teenager who lives with his dying mother and alcoholic, abusive father who beats him to a pulp on a regular basis. His only friend is his cousin, Matt (Russell, who could very well be Thomas Bangalter's long lost cousin). For some reason, Andrew feels the need to tape absolutely everything that goes on in life, and does so for the first twenty minutes on an old school over the shoulder camera.

At a party one night, he and his cousin meet Steve, a character who unfortunately gets reduced to being the token black guy. They go into a hole where there's a green glowy rock and ta da, because of it, they have superpowers. Big whoop. They can perform telekinesis and stuff. Then Andrew gets pushed a tad too far, he can't control his powers, he loves being dark and evil, and blah, blah, blah. Oh and I'll note there several parts where Andrew plays with the camera using his powers.

Like I said, this film is too found footage for my liking. First off, a good portion of the movie does a fail job at hiding the films heavy reliance on the gimmick.  A lot of shots show the camera being held by telekinesis and what not. There's a one scene I actually laughed out loud- it happens before Andrew's father visits him in the hospital, and the security guard tells him ""the camera has to stay on"". At that part, it was clear the movie lives and breathes the gimmick.

It's a shame because the acting for the most part is well done. Dane DeHaan is exceptional in the role and he captures the essence of a poor teenager being driven to insanity and embracing his dark side. His performance really chilling- it's like a high school shooting, almost like you're inn he mind of the disturbed killer. Russell is great too as his cousin although at the end it's too he just wants Andrew off his freaking lawn. Steve is a decent actor as well.

So what went wrong? What happened where i found the movie to be... Well, boring? Was I even supposed to care? Either way, this was one big headache of a movie and I certainly wouldn't be recommending it any time soon.",1336521600,8,3007,4.486288848263254

Normally I avoid writing spoilers as much as I can, but I have found that, no matter how I phrase this review, it's still pretty obvious.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHRONICLE is one of those films that is annoyingly close to being really, really good. The story concerns three high school seniors -- Andrew, Matt, and Steve. Andrew's mother is dying of lung cancer and his father is an abusive alcoholic. Andrew himself is your typical put-upon loser, the kind of skinny, whiny-voiced kid who seems to have forgotten to go through puberty. Although his family circumstances obviously make him a sympathetic character, it is not hard to see why he is so relentlessly bullied and teased at school. He's mopey, cowardly, isolated, and he carries a freaking camera around with him wherever he goes. Even to a rave.

Then, lo and behold, the boys stumble across a strange hole in the ground, inside of which is some kind of mysterious glowing force that emits sounds like feedback from a speaker the size of a bus. The boys investigate (natch) and then, whatdoyaknow, they find that they have developed super powers from the strange object (which conveniently disappears for the rest of the film).

The remainder of the story deals with the guys coming to terms with their new abilities (they don't seem particularly fazed by it) and learning how to use them. From here on out, the movie -- desperate for a villain -- takes the story down very predictable avenues. It turns out that having too much power can corrupt you (I'm surprised no one's ever realized this before), and before long, it's a battle royale to determine who will be the top dog of their little triumvirate.

The special effects are fantastic. They are nearly seamless, which helps detract from the fact that this is a ""found footage"" movie. These types of movies use the ""found footage"" conceit to enhance the realism of the film, but in a case like this, it mostly just detracts from the story. What does it say about a movie that it is much easier to believe that a character can fly or move things with his mind than it is to believe that he carries a running camera with him every single solitary place he goes? Even up in the clouds, at night, during a thunderstorm, while he cries alone because he puked beer on a girl that wanted to sleep with him. He even carries it to a funeral, for heaven's sake.

Near the end, when the film shifts back and forth between security cameras, news footage, and phone cameras, the ""found footage"" aspect becomes, ironically, less intrusive. At least, it seems more plausible. However, by then, the movie has devolved into a standard superhero showdown. Throughout the film, there are multiple references to philosophers and their beliefs on human nature, desire, or reality. It leads viewers to believe that there might be some kind of deeper theory driving the story, that there might be an allegory here for something grander and more interesting than teenagers playing football in the stratosphere. But, no. It seems as if the whole thing is basically about how much it sucks to be bullied by classmates and drunk dads.

Even that wouldn't be so bad if the movie didn't foolishly conclude with a complete logical back-flip. The movie's message -- perhaps muddied by its need for a clear-cut antagonist and conflict -- is literally told to the audience by a character who reminds us that, while the villain killed many people and endangered the lives of countless others in a blind fit of petulant rage, he was still basically a good guy at heart.

Wrong, movie. You can't have it both ways, at least not with a story that lacks as much meat as this one. Because the characters are so one-dimensional, the movie only works on a chewy, eye-candy level, but it desperately wants to make a watered-down point about Nature vs. Nurture, or perhaps the psychology of prepubescence. Either way, it comes across as half-baked, heavy-handed, and actually pretty ridiculous. And that's saying a lot for a film where teens use superpowers to scare little girls at toy stores.

Watch it for the special effects, but be prepared to be steadily annoyed by Andrew's nails-on-a-chalkboard voice and the rather quick-and-easy slide the movie takes from ""Gee, these powers are awesome"" to ""The world must burn!""",1336348800,4,4728,4.844059405940594

4728922,4,B005LAIGPA,"Most of the beings who have super powers in the comics are very altruistic beings, intent on being of service to the world.  The biggest example of this is Superman.  What happens though if you give these powers to an adolescent male who is experiencing: physical abuse at the hands of his alcoholic father; a mother dying of cancer; a school life where he is not one of the cool kids.  Well, as he uses his powers more and more, he starts striking out with them whenever unfairness again rears its ugly head.

His cousin is one of the cool kids plus a nice guy and tries to reason with him.  The cousin also got these powers.  But he can't pierce through all the bad stuff going on at home.

I really loved the first half of this film.  This was the getting to know the characters via a hand held camera as they fooled around with their newly acquired powers.  They were a lot of fun in this phase.  The back half of the film began to resemble CARRIE though and I began to lose interest as predictable super power fights took place between the cousins. The back half will probably appeal to the younger audience.

4728923,5,B005LAIGPA,"The acting was spectacular. They played their parts well; it was like I was watching a few real teenagers goofing around.
When I first realized it was a documentary style film, I cringed. I find them tacky and difficult to watch. I don't care too much for the shaking and the lack of professionalism that comes with a commercial film. However, most of the film was not shacking. In fact, a great deal of it was smooth and moved like a camera would in a normal movie. Of course, it was because they controlled it with their minds. Either way, it really helped take away the tacky parts that usually comes with documentary films. Another thing I like about how it was filmed was that it wasn't just one camera; it was under the premise that these tapes were found later, so were able to job from one angle to another as if it was professionally made.

Now all this, along with a great story line, amazing acting, and characters that I felt like I could relate to, made it a great movie. It had enough of the documentary style to it to make you feel like it was real and like you were there with them, while still holding on to the strengths of a normal film.

This movie was awesome! I pity them, but I also envy them.",1336003200,,1216,4.282608695652174
4728924,2,B005LAIGPA,"Although the characters start off quite likable and interesting, the super power element ends up forcing the plot down a very cliche super hero route.  The film is quite reminiscent of The Craft only with a male cast.  In other words a group of teenage friends who are bonded by their sudden introduction to the supernatural.

Dane DeHaan stars with a mopey vulnerability that's quite authentic, but unfortunately the film drives that single emotional note to the extreme.  His character becomes implausible, difficult to sympathize with, and down right annoying.  Generally I found especially the final act of this film (Spoiler: Andrew's major breakdown to a super villain) to be a huge failure, simply because it relied too heavily on multiple implausibilities.

The film probably would have worked better if it stuck to its more basic human elements.",1335571200,3,854,5.1521739130434785

The best part I liked about the movie is when they are flying around the sky and playing football with each other. I thought to myself, wow, I never seen that before in a movie. It would be so cool, if I could fly like that!

This movie is awesome because it is so much better than the before Found Video movies. The story is great, the filming is better, and the character development made sense. I definitely recommend this movie!",1335484800,3,734,4.311594202898551

I was actually looking forward to this movie. The preview made it seem a little ""X-Men"" like and I though it would be a neat idea. Almost from the beginning I was disappointed. I do however think that this is a movie meant for teenagers and not for me a 33 year old. To me this was a cross between a ton of different movies, most notably ""Hancock"" and ""Superman 3"", but really almost a blender full of movies. My biggest problem with this one is that it had no plot at all. This is pretty much a reality show about kids with superpowers. If scenes like the kids messing with some lady's car by moving it to another parking spot or eating chips without touching them with their hands is what you are looking for then this is for you. On a side note I think that the fake-documentary genre has run its course and needs to stop. Overall, a plot less movie that I think is geared toward teens, not for me. I give it a C+.",1335398400,4,1233,4.228813559322034
4728928,2,B005LAIGPA,"Okay, first I will say that one of the reasons that I did not care much for this movie is that I HATE this kind of film making.  That's the over-the-shoulder, 1st-person, portable-camera style of film (ex. Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project).  The main reason that I hate this is because I feel like I'm watching a reality TV show or documentary, not a movie.  When I sit down at a theater, I want to feel like I am watching a movie.  The other reason that I hate them is because the film makers normally try too hard to make it work, instead of focusing on the film itself.  I heard that Chronicle was filmed like that but I decided to give it a chance and walk into it with an open mind.  Unfortunately, the film confirmed my reasons all the more why I distaste this type of movie.

First, I'll start with saying that the story was actually pretty good.  It was a character based action movie, kind of like Hanna.  Three teenagers stumble upon some kind of ""radioactive alien crystal"" which releases a weird energy that makes all of them powerful telekinetics.  The story did a good job developing the characters and showed them experimenting with their powers and taking larger steps throughout.  At first, they moved small objects and toward the end of the film, they were throwing heavy objects while levitating.  I also looked at this film as a superhero origin story.  I'll try not to spoil everything, but I felt that it concluded nicely with one character appearing ready to accept the life of a superhero.

Now on to what I didn't like.  I said in the title that I felt that they tried ""too hard"" with the narrative camera.  Here's what I mean (this will probably only make sense if you've seen the movie, but I'll try to explain).  The film is entirely shot in 1st person, with the viewer apparently seeing everything through the lens of the character's camaras.  With that being said...how often do you see someone who just decides to ""film everything""?  How many people to you know that film every waking moment of their lives including when they're walking or in the car?  How often does a girl answer the doorbell while still holding a camera?  And how can the viewer expect that someone who is in the middle of a confrontation with his cousin would care about or could focus on making his camera float?  The bottom line is that the things they did to try and make it more ""realistic"" actually made it more unrealistic. Not to mention, these kinds of films always have bad camera angles in a lot of scenes, so it's often hard to tell what is going on.

Another thing I really didn't like was how short the film was.  By the time the credits started rolling, I had only been in the theater 80 min.  I'm glad I waited and only paid $1.50 to see the movie because I would have been pretty pissed if I had paid $10 for an 80 min movie.  This movie could have been great.  I normally like comic book type superhero movies and action movies.  This could have been a 4 or 5 star movie in my book if they had just made it a little longer and film it like an actual movie, instead of trying too hard to make the 1st person camera thing work.  Trying too hard to make the 1st person movie work in a good film is the same thing as trying too hard to find spots to enhance the 3D in a script with no substance otherwise.",1335312000,7,3321,4.354471544715447
4728929,5,B005LAIGPA,This is a defined 5 star movie. I went and just expected a little action but instead I got a pleasant surprise. This film kept me on the edge of my seat having goosebumps.

4729012,5,B005LAIGPA,"Ok I'm gonna keep this short if you like Sci-Fi Films and or Superhero films then you will like this movie.  It's a nice twist with teens getting superpowers in the present. It gives you a ""what would you do"" type feel if you suddenly got superpowers.  Would you use it for good or evil, will you get addicted to the power and feel everyone beneath you or would you try to help people and make the world better.  I have no complaints about the movie it was great my only complaint is i can't wait for the DVD to come out and the sequel so many questions that wasn't really answered.  I mean yea we know how they got there powers but where did that crystal rock ""or whatever it is"" come from.  Anyways it's a great flick and i think you should check it out especially if  you like Sci-Fi/Superhero movies.  For people that's worried about them using the ""found footage"" to present the movie don't worry it works out great for the movie since these days you have alot of people who record everything in there life if it's just a video blog or just for fun.  Trust me i usually don't like movies like this with the camera shaking around movies like cloverfield or quarantine but it worked out really well.  I hope you find my review helpful this is actually my first time writing one on here but i liked the movie so much i just wanted to give my 2cents without spoiling anything.",1334102400,18,1377,4.285714285714286
4729013,5,B005LAIGPA,"When I first heard about this film, I thought that it was simply another cheap ""found footage"" attempt at the superhero genre about three kids who get superpowers and one of them is mentally unstable.

This is why, generally, marketing sucks.

Thus at first I ignored it, not really caring until I saw statements from comic-book creators and others whose opinions I really respect calling it a great film. This piqued my curiosity. I wondered why so many people were really enjoying this film. I finally got around to seeing it this past weekend, and I can say wholeheartedly that this is an excellent film that is more in the vein of the great ""found footage"" film genre, like CLOVERFIELD, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and THE LAST EXORCISM rather than the lackluster attempts such as QUARANTINE, the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise and most of the associated horror films it spawned.

The way that I see the film is as a great entry into the superhero genre, relating to characters like Spider-Man and The X-Men. What if three high-school boys got superpowers, but didn't have the moral compass of a character like Professor X or Uncle Ben?

The film is the brainchild of director Josh Trank and his co-writer Max Landis (son of the once-great John Landis), and it embraces the tropes of superhero cinema and the ""found footage"" conceit and it turns both ideas on their heads. While most of the film is shot from one point of view, as their telekinetic powers grow, they're able to move the camera to unnatural POV shots rather than just keeping it static. And especially the third act of the film begins to use several different cameras, such as camera phones, security cameras, ATM cameras and police surveillance cameras splicing them all together to get a greater perspective and sense of cinematic urgency that films of this type generally lack. The special effects of the film are crucial and very rarely do they not feel seamless. Trank also gives the control of the in-film camera to the most important character rather than let it change hands terribly often or give it to a secondary character. This allows us to watch the evolution of the character's arc and give it a more organic feel.

The film also features powerful performances by Dane DeHaan as the increasingly isolated and troubled Andrew and Alex Russell as his conflicted cousin Matt. The only issue that I have with the film, and it's a pretty minor quibble, is that the dialogue sometimes doesn't feel natural, and I think that's more of an issue of restraint rather than the actors playing it badly or the writing being poor.

When all is said and done, the film is very clever, very well-paced (it's very brief, running at around 80 minutes), and very well-acted. It puts a very refreshing spin on a genre we're becoming maybe a little too familiar with and helps breathe new life into it. It really is the first great film of the year.",1333843200,2,2908,4.737154150197629
4729014,4,B005LAIGPA,"What? The first truly great film of 2012 is a superhero movie? And the words ""Dark Knight"" and ""Avengers"" are nowhere to be found? Both of those surefire blockbusters will have a hard time measuring up to the energy and realism of Chronicle, a film that shows having superpowers is about more than vague slogans like ""with great power comes great responsibility"", it's a heavy burden and one not everybody is prepared to handle.

Over the last few years as comic book movies have all but overtaken Hollywood with brightly suited heroes in silly masks, only on occasion do we get one that dares to take a different approach. Movies like Kick-Ass and Super spring to mind, but those are really just deconstructions that don't take comic books seriously at all. Surprisingly, M. Night Shyamalan had the right idea a few years ago in what was quietly his best film, Unbreakable, a convincing and authentic look at the origins of a superhero and the man who would come to be his nemesis.  With Chronicle, newcomer Joshua Trank has tapped into that same idea, only with a healthy dose of teenage hormones and emotional volatility.

For once, the annoying ""found footage"" sub-genre is put to solid use as Andrew(Dane Dehaan), a bullied social outcast begins documenting every moment of his life. He does it at first to capture the physical abuses by his father, but it isn't long before we see that there's no real escape for Andrew anywhere. He's treated just as badly at school, with his only friend being his popular cousin, Matt(Alex Russell). Andrew's barely contained anger and depression is only made worse by the worsening condition of his mother, slowly dying at home and the family unable to pay for the medications she needs.

Trying to break Andrew out of his funk, Matt takes him to a party, where he's introduced to the most popular guy in school, Steve(Michael B. Jordan). Tell him that he and Matt have founded something really cool out in the woods, Andrew reluctantly follows them into a cavernous sinkhole, where they discover a strange glowing object. Rather than doing the smart thing and running for the hills, they touch it, forcing it to emit a piercing shriek, knocking the boys unconscious.

Trank doesn't show us the immediate effects, instead skipping ahead in time, when the three have gained some knowledge of their mysteriously granted powers. In the beginning, these powers unite them as best friends, testing out their newfound abilities in silly exercises that could only spring from the mind of teenage boys, like creating a gust of wind to lift up cheerleaders' skirts. It isn't long before they start to figure out that their powers are growing exponentially the more they're used, almost like a muscle, and after Andrew goes a bit too far it's time to start setting some ground rules.

But if there's one thing angry youths don't like, it's a bunch of people telling them what to do. Especially when you've been held back for as long as Andrew has. Seeing his powers as not only a means of exacting vengeance against those who wronged him, but also as something of a birthright considering the turmoil he's lived through. Exploiting it just enough, he's happy with the limited amount of school-wide celebrity it affords him, but it's nothing like the real popularity of his two friends. Jealousy quickly gives way to rage, and soon Andrew is on a dangerous, super powered tailspin.

With a script co-written by Trank and Max Landis(the son of filmmaker John Landis), Chronicle puts a real world spin on what has always been the most interesting aspect of the superhero/supervillain divide, and that is how they came to be. The theory has always been that it takes a certain level of arrogance to become a hero, and an equal level of anguish to become a bad guy. In Chronicle, just as in most comic books, the one we deem the villain never sees himself as such, and it can be argued there isn't truly one in the film. Watching Andrew, Matt, and Steve develop into who they will ultimately become is consistently fascinating. While all three are perfectly cast, it's DeHaan who makes the biggest impression, and as Andrew his desperation to get out of his pathetic life is the film's driving force.

That's not to say it's all good. While Trank makes rational use of the handheld cam, there are some scenes where it's presence doesn't make a whole lot of sense, even for Andrew who seems to be obsessed with recording everything for some future audience. The introduction of a love story between Matt and and video blogger named Ashley goes nowhere, except to make her a potential damsel in distress. She would have been better used as a point of contention between the friends.

Still, these are minor complaints in a film that features a number of new faces I can't wait to see in other projects. While the budget isn't huge, Trank makes the most out of what are fairly simple special effects, saving the big stuff for the destructive finale that makes me think what a live-action Akira should look like. It's no wonder he's being looked at to possibly relaunch the Fantastic Four film franchise, as he knows exactly how to capture the wonder that comes with discovering the scope of amazing powers. As the boys put their strength to the test, they eventually learn to fly, and it's like we're right there with them as they savor this wondrous experience.

Clocking in at only 80 minutes, Chronicle doesn't get bogged down in deep messages, and yet it still manages to be one of the smartest superhero movies we've seen in a very long time.",1332374400,4,5571,4.7518097207859356

Predictably, things spiral out of control for the three. This is a realistic, and quite good film about a young man with problems who is unable to control the powers he discovers. His two friends try to help, but they are unable to control him. This one was a pleasant surprise and is the best movie of its kind since Paranormal Activity.",1330473600,49,587,4.70873786407767
4729016,4,B005LAIGPA,"If you could have a superpower, what would it be? That's a popular icebreaker question and you can tell a lot about a person by how they answer it. Though there are numerous answers, flight and x-ray vision are two that often come up. Often those who answer ""flight"" are those who are extremely altruistic while those that answer ""x-ray vision"" are usually very self-centered and conceited. The possibility of humans, particularly teenagers, gaining such abilities is the plot device that drives the movie CHRONICLE.

The movie is a ""found footage"" movie; it's a movie that portends to be actual real video footage that has been edited together into a movie. In CHRONICLE high school senior Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan) has been a virtual nobody his entire high school life. His father is an alcoholic who beats him. His mother lies in bed, slowly dying from an unnamed disease. Her illness has increased Richard Detmer's (Michael Kelly) drinking and in turn the frequency of Andrew's beatings. Andrew only has a few more months until graduation and he's clinging to anything that will see him through until then; if he can graduate he knows he can escape. Andrew's only friend in the world is his cousin, Matt Garetty (Alex Russell). Matt and Andrew are in the same class, but Matt is a popular student. He's the guy all the guys want to be like. Matt does small things to try to get Andrew out of his shell and says hi to him at school, but that's about it. Andrew buys a video camera to begin taping his life and it becomes an outlet for him. One night, Matt brings Andrew along with him to a rave. While there, Matt and his friend Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan), who happens to be THE most popular student in the entire school, discover an underground cavern. They drag Andrew along with them to film what they have found. As it turns out the cavern ends up leading to a strange underground crystal and when they boys touch it their noses start to bleed and the Earth starts to shake.

Weeks later, the three boys are best friends. They do everything together and it soon becomes clear why: there experiences in the cavern have bonded them and given them super human abilities. They seem to possess powers of telekinesis and impenetrable skin (forks and knives been when jabbed against their bodies). As the film progresses, the boys discover even more abilities. However, as they do so, they also begin to struggle with their own emotions and beliefs. Steve seems unchanged by what's happened to him, Matt begins to realize that he gave up his core beliefs to become popular, and Andrew struggles with an internal rage that threatens to consume him.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed CHRONICLE. I'm not a big fan of found-footage movies, for instance I hated THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and I thought the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was laughable. However, I did like CLOVERFIELD. CHRONICLE is more akin in tone and style to CLOVERFIELD with a touch of M. Night Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE thrown in for good measure. Until the latter part of the movie, CHRONICLE feels like film taken from a teenage outcast's personal camera. Andrew has a really difficult life. He uses his camera to show the world what he has to deal with: the beatings from his father, the bullying at school, his deep love and devotion towards his dying mother whom he can't do anything for, and the flippant way his cousin Matt treats him. As the movie progresses, the focus begins to change. Instead of being a chronicle of his life to show others his innocence, it becomes a chronicle of how Andrew changes and becomes the very thing he hates at the beginning of the movie.

The overall plot of the movie is fairly predictable, but for a smaller-budget picture the director did a remarkable job of making the special effects look realistic. Also, there's some really great writing in the movie; the script allows for some very solid character development as the movie progresses. The effects and script are helped by some great acting. If this wasn't a sci-fi/action-drama, Dane DeHaan would probably be nominated for a bunch of acting awards for his portrayal of Andrew. Also, notable are Michael B. Jordan and Ashley Hinshaw as Matt's girlfriend Casey Letter. These are some actors whose stars will soon be rising fast.

Overall, even though CHRONICLE is a found footage movie, it avoids many of the pitfalls of those films and through some solid special effects, exceptional writing, and impressive acting, it makes one believe that not only can a man fly (at least in the movies), but forces one to think about what the consequences of having such powers might be.",1330041600,,4642,4.74721189591078
4729017,4,B005LAIGPA,"It's always been a dream of teenage boys to have telekinesis. Be it just trying to get the door close when you're trying to sleep or shoving the idiot who's driving behind you off the road, telekinesis is the ultimate form of passive/aggression.  Although the latest movie trend has been to depict realistic superheroes, few have truly committed to the format.  Chronicle is so steeped in its high school subculture that the word superhero is never even mentioned.

Chronicle starts with high school and builds its plot from there: disaffected loner Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan), his more well-adjusted cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell), and popular kid Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) discover alien crystals.  The crystals vibrate and hum, inflicting nosebleeds on the three teenagers, all of it recorded by Andrew on film.  The camera winks out only to resume weeks later with a demonstration of their newfound powers.

Chronicle's name is obscure but apt because Andrew films everything.  The entire movie is pieced together from Andrew's camera and -- later -- security cameras, news footage, and home video of the inevitable conclusion.

Chronicle nails what kids with superpowers would do with them: They'd play pranks, of course.  Their powers are not limited to bending spoons however. Their telekinesis escalates from nudging things to shoving things to creating personal shields and eventually flight.  When that happens, all bets are off.

In the beginning the triumvirate, bound by their collective secret, tries hard to support each other. Drunk fathers, social misadventures with girls, and high school popularity all gnaw away at their common bond. Also, a human being flying thousands of feet in the air is dangerous.

Chronicle records all of this with the mundanity of a reality show, but it rises above the Blair Witch Project genre when it takes to the skies, where the wind roars constantly.  Some of the special effects are less spectacular - the ones that involve peculiar lighting, like a juggling talent show, are obviously CGI - but when it counts Chronicle's special effects are superb.

Chronicle pulls no punches in portraying a broken home life and how a superpower only magnifies the pain.  The inevitability of its protagonists' fates is also the film's biggest flaw. It's no surprise who will take on the role of the hero and who will be the villain.

But that doesn't detract from the breathtaking conclusion, a terrifying and (due to the multiple camera POV) disorienting display of telekinesis powered by human emotion.  It's worth the price of admission alone.

It's easy to chalk Chronicle up as an unrealistic fantasy.  But I couldn't get it out of my head that if you replace the word ""telekinesis"" with ""gun""...the body count at the end of the film doesn't seem so unrealistic after all.",1329609600,3,2834,5.08207343412527

4729019,5,B005LAIGPA,"When friends have a falling out, it's best for all parties involved - including unwitting bystanders - that they don't have destructive superhuman abilities. Because the collateral damage off that spat is wicked crazy. CHRONICLE is one of them ""found footage"" films, the narrative unfolding pseudo-documentary-style mainly thru video cameras employed by the characters. Other recording devices - cell phone & traffic cameras and security feeds and tools brought to bear by breaking news media coverage - come into play later on in the tremendous third act.

CHRONICLE centers around the strange thing what befalls three high school seniors: the popular and charismatic Steve (Michael B. Jordan); the smart and just a bit pretentious Matt (Alex Russell); and Andrew (Dane DeHaan), the weirdo loner burdened with the dying mom and abusive dad. It's Andrew who opts to escape his disturbing home life by throwing himself into his handycam hobby. As escapism he films everything in sight. He takes his video recorder everywhere. While attending a rave, Steve, Matt, and Andrew are diverted by a deep hole in the ground in the nearby woods. What they eventually stumble across somehow imbues them with super powers. Soon Steve, Matt, and Andrew are experimenting (read: goofing around) with telekinesis and learning how to fly (which is just another extension of telekinesis). Of course, there are the requisite nose bleeds.

Andrew demonstrates a natural affinity for his newfound talents. They develop more quickly than do Matt's or Steve's. So at least he has that to feel good about. But there's a disconnect with the troubled Andrew. The family home melodrama exacerbates his sense of alienation. Still, their mutual powers draw the trio closer together. They begin to hang out a lot more.

There's an organic flow to the story, or during the first two thirds anyway. The script allows the actors to sound off with believable dialogue. The three leads are natural in their roles; there's an authentic vibe. I like to think that the stuff they get up to initially, in exploring their powers, are stuff that normal teenagers would think up. Their antics in the supermarket are pretty hilarious, even though that was a mean thing they did, spooking the little girl. Me, I probably won't be able to help abusing my powers a little bit. Steve, Matt, and Andrew apply theirs to have fun and impress other kids (by, say, staging a magic show or showing off while playing the quarters beer game). Matt is the most level-headed of the bunch. He at least seems aware of the necessity of keeping their secret. He tries to lay down some ground rules, like not using their abilities on living things or using them when they're angry. It's worrying that the much bullied Andrew doesn't see the point of these rules.

Most of the film's first half is so lighthearted and goofy that it's all the more impactful when things finally get serious. One of the three begins to subscribe to that old ""survival of the fittest"" way of thinking. He begins to regard himself as the ultimate predator and mere humans as disposable insects. The other two try to talk sense into him, but, by that stage, we're all just pretty much waiting for the inevitable downspiral into fighty fight.

I happened to really like CLOVERFIELD, a recent ""found footage"" monster film (I know a lot of folks didn't). I think that CHRONICLE shares CLOVERFIELD'S sense of immediacy. Only, this time, you get a feel for what it may really be like to be caught on ground zero when ridiculously powerful metahumans furiously duke it out. One famous landmark in Seattle gets a shellacking.

Did you think the film needed to delve more into the crystalline object in the underground cavern which (it's assumed) bestowed paranormal talents on them kids? I don't think so. I even liked that the story dropped it. The kids make an attempt to revisit the hole in the ground, but things don't pan out, and they shrug it off. And while the introduction of the girl who records with her own camera for her blog may be a convenient plot device, she does ground one of the characters. I like that there's a thru line to the story, that ***SPOILERS NOW FOR THE REST OF THE SENTENCE*** the superhumans are later exposed to the world. This raises the stakes tremendously. It encompasses the frenetic third act. There are some archetypal elements that come into play in this collision between an amoral monster and his friend still trying to talk him down. And it ultimately defines the makings of a hero. The special effects are pretty amazing considering the film's low budget. The flying sequences are breathlessly entertaining. And while I enjoyed the sense of humor and the cool superhero beats, these alone wouldn't have been enough. You required those solid chunks of storytelling and character development to prop them up.",1328918400,30,4861,4.900364520048603
4729020,5,B005LAIGPA,"**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 2/8/12**

With Chronicle, 2012 has its first great movie. It's easily the most exciting, watchable action/sci-fi film in months. What first-time director Josh Trank was able to accomplish on a shoe-string (at least by Hollywood standards) budget is so cool that it borders on unbelievable.

The story will be familiar to most who have watched any superpower origin tale. More specifically, the script owes a great debt to pioneering 80's anime classic Akira. Three teenagers, one of them weaker, more socially awkward, and ultimately more disturbed, start to develop mysterious powers after an incident outside of a party. Andrew, the younger/weaker of the three (played by the pitch-perfect Dane DeHaan) finds he's able to control his newfound abilities to a greater and more impressive extent than the others. But, due to circumstances not entirely under his control, the powers prove to be too much for him. And thus, we have conflict.

While the story's familiar, the execution is startlingly fresh. Sure, the ""found footage"" genre has been around for awhile, but until now, I'm not sure it's ever been exploited to its full potential. Viewing this incredible story through an everyday lens gives the film a naturalistic feel and makes the effects all that more shocking, real and... well... fun. And honestly, ""fun"" is what this movie's about. Not that it's super happy or anything, but it's certainly a jolt of guerrilla film-making. In a world of polished studio action movies, this feels more like a couple of (ridiculously creative) storytellers playing around. Of course, it helps that they've got a taut, wonderfully human story at the core. For as awesome and exciting as the set-pieces are, Chronicle doesn't take the easy way out. Its characters feel real and completely sympathetic. In other words, it's really got a bit of everything for everyone. And at just under 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome. What more could you ask for? A-",1328832000,3,2013,5.093939393939394
4729021,3,B005LAIGPA,"I'm pretty sure that I've seen most if not all of the genre now called ""found footage"" films, going back the grandmother of them all ""The Blair Witch Project.""  I've liked some and not others pretty much like any other film.  One common thread is a theme of dread, relatively unknown actors and filmmakers, and low budget.  Fine, no problem.  Director Josh Trank throws a few wrinkles into the camera footage by not limiting the filming to just one camera.  This iteration incorporates a friend's use of a camera (school reporter doncha know), hospital security cameras, helicopter cameras, etc. and then shows it edited together to get the movie.

Our 3 teenage ""heroes"" being a little tipsy coming from a party find a big hole in the ground and decide to slip into it and see what's what.  Some alien remnants (I guess) are discovered that put out some intergalactic emission that gives the 3 boys supernatural powers.  As they discover their powers, they begin to innocently play tricks on each other and eventually other people.  As their use increases, so does their strength.  As one points out, the gift is like a muscle.  The more you use it the stronger it becomes.  Eventually they do attain strength and even the ability to fly.  In other words, Superman/boy without the costume.

One of the boys, Andrew (Dane DeHaan) has always been an outcast and socially shy.  His mother is gravely ill with some undisclosed respiratory problem and his father is an out of work fireman who hits the bottle and his son.  His cousin Matt (Alex Russell) is one of those cool kids but not in the athletic hierarchy.  Finally there is Steve (Michael B. Jordan) who is at the peak of high school cool.  An athlete, class president and on his way to a political career.  Eventually, Andrew realizes by using his powers he too can become cool, but alas he stumbles when he tries to bed one of his classmates.  He's never the same.  He becomes violent and tragedy ensues.

Cousin Matt becomes the eventual voice of reason and tries to reel in Andrew.  The film certainly has its moments.  The interaction between the guys seems legit.  Yet there is something not quite right about Andrew complete personality change.  It's like Bruce Banner changing into The Hulk.  The other two are not affected this way.  Even at a crisp 84 minute running time, the final flying/destruction sequence seems to go on forever.  And I couldn't help thinking; did we really need to use the ""found footage"" technique with this story?",1328832000,27,2503,4.729166666666667
