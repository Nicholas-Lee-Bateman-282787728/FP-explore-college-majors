8653009,5,B00JPQ1IWY,"Martial arts, comedy and hilarious dubbed voices from the 70's and 80's. Each 90 minute movie of the 12 included, has an intriguing story to warrant a ton of nearly endless martial arts kung fu fighting, where each hit sounds like a block hitting another block, in the classic sound style you might remember from the past. As a major martial arts fan, there are some beautiful acrobatics and fight routines here that are a joy to watch.

8653014,5,B00JPQ1IWY,Loved these movies even tho some call them Bruce exploitation movies. I take them simply for the entertainment values. Imitation is the simply form flattery.
