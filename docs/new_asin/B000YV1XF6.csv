8234337,4,B000YV1XF6,"These are three really good Harlequin movies.  Remember, you can preview these movies when they come on Lifetime.  Like the books they are a good watch.  Here are the titles of the movies and what it says on the back to help you decide if you want to make the purchase.

This Matter of Marriage
Two female architects reenter the dating game while building a major project.  They learn that building thier business together does not mean that they can't pursue personal relationships at the same time.

8234338,5,B000YV1XF6,The DVDs are excellent condition.  The three movies are enjoyable to watch if you're into romance story.,1224288000,,104,5.117647058823529
8234339,2,B000YV1XF6,Now I know why this triple feature is so cheap in price. Movies were slightly grainy like they were duplicated on a poor quality copy machine at a lower speed. Discs did not have any special features or selection options. Nor did it have closed caption options.,1224028800,,261,4.574468085106383
8234340,4,B000YV1XF6,"enjoy all stories from harlequin, hope to see more of them soon, have all the titles out",1221955200,,88,4.235294117647059
8234341,5,B000YV1XF6,"Product was received on time and in excellent shape.

However, there are some scenes in the video I would not want to watch with children in the room. I was not expecting that.",1218499200,,176,4.333333333333333
8234342,5,B000YV1XF6,All three movies are mystery romances with good endings. Great watch on a cold rainy or snowy day. Buying them in the set is a really good buy. If you enjoy the Harlequin books you will enjoy these too. There are 4 volumes and 12 movies. My favorite in this volume is Another Woman. All movies have been played on the Hallmark Channel and are good entertainment for the family.,1217289600,3,377,4.4
8234343,1,B000YV1XF6,I was truly disappointed in the nude scene in Another Woman.  I do not appreciate paying for a romance movie and it end up having a surprise nude scene.  The movie was thrown away immediately.  The same for This Matter of Marriage.  The ending scene in the shower was unnecessary and disappointing.  This DVD was thrown away as well.  Amazon needs to add some way to identify nude scenes to paying buyers.,1213488000,,405,4.555555555555555
8234344,2,B000YV1XF6,"I saw these movies on the WE channel some time ago and was excited to find them on DVD. I know they edit movies for TV so I hoped that the NR rating wasn't bad.  I Loved ""At the Midnight Hour"", just as I remembered it. ""This Matter of Marriage"" we still cute, but the last scene in the shower was a bit uncomfortable because it went on for a long time just showing unclothed profiles. What saddened me most, was ""Another Woman"". I have to say this was my favorite from TV and I was so excited to get it. What a disappointment to find they had added a nude scene on the beach that ruined this movie for me. I will be disguarding this movie from my library and hoping to record it when it comes on TV again.",1206748800,,705,4.0
