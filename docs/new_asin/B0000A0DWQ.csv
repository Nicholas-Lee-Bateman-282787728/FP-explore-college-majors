1900242,2,B0000A0DWQ,"""The Shadow Strikes"" is nothing more than a B-movie detective story. There is nothing shadowy about the Shadow; the flm has no special effects -- I am sure the budget had no money for any effects. It's run of the mill style of B movies of the 30s. It's okay if you have no great expectations of being much entertained.",1193270400,,318,4.316666666666666
1900243,2,B0000A0DWQ,I liked the film... as it is similar in style to The Thin Man and Charlie Chan series. Rod LaRoque does a great job as THE SHADOW. Having said that there are probably better prints of this film on the market.,1116460800,5,208,4.097560975609756
1900244,3,B0000A0DWQ,"Note: I can not say that The Shadow Strikes depicts the ""The Shadow"" in all its glory. However, for a true representation of ""The Shadow"" as intended, just as chilling as the radio program (if you want The Shadow with the cape and the laugh that gives you goosebumps), I would recommend ""The Shadow Serial"" (1940), which is a Shadow collection of all 15 movie episodes by Columbia.
""The Shadow"" was a popular radio program (before television sets were made for the home). In the pulp comic books, The Shadow ""borrowed"" the idenity ""Lamont Cranston"" to get into the social circles. It began on radio on the Dectective Story Hour on July 31, 1930 as a character in the story.  James La Curto was the voice 1930-31 and then Frank Readick Jr. (1931-37).  The program became known as ""The Shadow"" on September 26, 1937. Also providing the voice of the ""The Shadow"" was Orson Welles (1937-38), Bill Johnstone (1938-43), Bret Morrison in 1943, John Archer in 1944 and Bret Morrison again in 1945-54. The last radio program of ""The Shadow"" was broadcast December 26, 1954.

  This is the first motion picture of ""The Shadow"" starring Rod La Rocque as Lamont Granston/The Shadow.  This story is based upon ""The Ghost of the Manor"" by Maxwell Grant, from the Street and Smith Magazine.
  Two thieves break into the safe of Attourney, Chester Randall, but their plans are foiled by a mysterious man who holds them up until the police arrive and then he disappears.  Then the mystery man helps a wealthy old man with his Last Will and Testamnet.  Suddenly the old man is shot from the window.  Investigator, Lamont Granston is posing as the victim, Attourney Randall, to get closer to the suspects and solving the crime.  But the police do not trust ""The Shadow"" (it is their first time deal with the mystery man) who is trying to help the police, but must remain unseen.  While the police are after ""The Shadow"", he leads them to the real crooks.
  Includes the Grand national Films trademark of the giant clock on the building.

7995025,2,B0000A0DWQ,"The opening scene catches poor Lamont Cranston (Rod La Rocque) moping over a bullet.  Later, he thwarts a clumsy attempt to break into the humongous safe in Chester Randall's office.  Lamont shows up as the Shadow and stays on as attorney Randall.  Rich guy Jasper Delthern (James Blakeley) wants Randall to revise his Will and winds up dead, shot through the window.  One of the heirs is a gambler on a losing streak.  Gangsters get involved as does the butler for the Delthern's.  A lot of money is at stake and everyone wants it.  Can the Shadow, posing as Randall, solve the case before he's unmasked!?!?  Not that he ever wears a mask in this movie.  Just a cape.  And hat.  He left his charisma and charm at home.

In a word................dull.  The story is routine, there is very little excitement to be had, no suspense, cardboard characters, and La Rocque as the Shadow is stiff as a board, expressionless, zero personality, tedious, bland.  I wouldn't watch this movie again even if you put my finger in a socket and flipped the switch.",1434240000,,1048,4.655737704918033

The movie begins with a man using a magnifying glass to examine a bullet. Can it be matched? Next two burglars open a safe, but are caught by ""the Shadow"". The police arrive in time. Randall gets a telephone call for help: a client wants a new will. Then a shot prevents the new will from being made! The police arrive, then newsmen. One nephew is arrested. Another man loses money at gambling. [Were the games rigged?] Carrying a pistol seems common. The story runs on. ""Randall"" escapes detection of his ruse. [No government identification in those days.] Randall sees the nephew at the gambling house. ""Have you any suspicions?"" Will newspapermen say anything to get their story? Then a shot comes from the library. Winsted was shot by Jasper (an heir removed leaves more for the rest).

One heir becomes suspicious of ""Randall"" because of a problem with the telephone. The police are looking for ""Randall"" (who got a tip from a young lady). We see a very primitive device for listening to a conversation. The hear the plot to destroy the will so the heirs get an equal share (one has big gambling debts). But the Shadow prevents this. Marcia changes her mind. The listening device is discovered. ""Follow that car."" There is a conflict in Harris' office, and a surprise confession. The next day's newspaper headlines tell the story. A baffling case was solved. There is happy news for Marcia. Lamont Granston inspects the bullet left by that racketeer. That hat and cloak may be used again.

So who shot Mr. Delthern? And Winsted Comstock? Was this edited out? The actors plod through this dull story, which is at best average. A better story makes a better movie. This story was adapted from Maxwell Grant's ""The Ghost of the Manor"" story published in the Street and Smith Shadow Magazine. It must have been one of those pulp magazines popular in the 1920s and 1930s. [A ""shadow"" was the name for any undercover operative who followed a person.
