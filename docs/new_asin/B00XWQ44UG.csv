8716918,3,B00XWQ44UG,"A diverse group of travelers during the zombie apocalypse come across a school and decide to bed down. Their leader is missing a foot and is cared for by a criminal in an orange jump suit. We discover the reason for the group's diversity was that they were at a compound and opted to leave the ""retards"" behind. While at the school, they discover the zombies are turning back to cured people...only to be killed and eaten again. This anomaly provides curiosity that needs further investigation and the reason for the outbreak is also revealed.

The first part of the film is light and humorous. This is replaced by dark humor with religious overtones, although I would argue the characters provided that overtone themselves based on their beliefs and it was not the intended theme of the film.  I liked the first half better than the last half.

8716920,4,B00XWQ44UG,"I'm a zombie fan, so there are no bad zombie movies, just some better than others (OK, ""Oasis of the Zombies"" is an exception).  This one has an odd plot with a resurrectionist zombie.  Good for the die hard fan, but may be a bit much for TWD devotees.",1462147200,,252,4.122448979591836

8716923,1,B00XWQ44UG,"I couldn't even stomach the first 10 minutes of this lame film.  Stupid humor and mediocre acting, wish the zombies would have just eaten all of them from the beginning.  Go head and waste your money, I did.",1446768000,2,207,4.421052631578948
