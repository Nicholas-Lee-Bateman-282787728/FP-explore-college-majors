8367112,5,B002EAYDJI,"There is not a lot more that I can add, other than quoting Neil Davies. I myself had also seen this when it first came out.  I was rolling so hard when viewing this. The grin never left my face, the entire viewing time. I was more than impressed, to suddenly see the ""acting"" talents, of one of my most favorite ""Dark Film Composers"" as the main subject, of this insanely humorous film..  His acting is MORE than convincing..  The film hit's very close to home.. not of my own experience, yet with what I have seen of people in the same circumstance and situation of the ""character"" of this film. I am certain, that there are many people out there, who will be able to relate to the ""moment""  and the ""experience""  depicted in this film.. on more levels than one. I highly recommend! As Neil Davies mentioned, be careful of who you view it with..  `..'",1379721600,,852,4.360759493670886
8367113,5,B002EAYDJI,"if one's into puerile comedy (as i am) i cannot recommend this strongly enough. i LMAO almost continuously, possibly cause i can relate to many situs therein. AFAIC, crude and rude are my favorite kinda comedy -- even better when alcohol plays a major role.

TONY LONGWORTH SHINES and his music's excellent. this certainly deserves to be available all over but due to the impending Nanny State, unless we step up and demand change, i fear this'll be relegated to 'cult' status (unfortunately for the openminded adults amongst us).",1248220800,,530,4.955056179775281
8367114,5,B002EAYDJI,"I'm not a huge fan of comedy, but this short was hilarious. It has a ton of bonus features that I also really appreciated, you can really see the effort that went in to this. For a short, and for the features, get it, and add it to your short films collection. Tony did a fantastic job on this, hat's off to him and his crew.",1248048000,,325,3.9393939393939394
8367115,4,B002EAYDJI,Incredibly funny short. Great physical humor from Longworth as his timing is right on the money as well. The additional of all the extras make it well worth the purchase.,1247961600,,170,4.7
8367116,5,B002EAYDJI,"I was lucky enough to see this short film back when it was first made. Very crude and very funny. Don't watch it with your elderly aunt but get the beers in, sit down and prepare to be disgusted and amused as this story of one mistake leading to another unfolds. Very much a solo performance (in more ways than one!) the lead is totally believable as a hopeless drunk, enough to worry his family, should they see this. I suspect method acting.

On this DVD release, as well as the film itself you get loads of extras and behind the scenes footage. The film is worth the price itself, but the additions on the DVD make it a must buy for anyone who likes their humour rude, crude and very funny.",1247788800,,693,4.25
