8719420,4,B00YZGY9F2,It is very different from his masterpiece Adriana Lecouvreur both by libretto and the music,1502496000,,91,5.133333333333334
8719421,5,B00YZGY9F2,"So Cilea has written two master pieces;  Adrianna is better known than L'Arlesiana.  But the latter is more powerful.  I enjoyed this production.  The mother's incredible aria is sung while she strolls around with a baby carriage.  Though too much of the action takes place on top of and under a table, it somehow works.  The tenor's beautiful Lament is well done...in fact all the voices are excellent.  According to the libretto, the girl from Arles never appears in the opera, in this production we see her during the opening music romping with the tenor; it works though she never sings a note.  I sang the tenor aria in an opera workshop some years ago (many a moon in fact) and I had my friend play my retarded brother lie on the floor in a supposed sheep fold; I sat with all the letters I'd sent and received from the girl and tore them in disgust.  This is more literally what is supposed to happen...no table climbing.  Federico is supposed to jump from a roof after going after a village taunter; here instead he slits his throat....a very worthwhile production and an opera too long neglected...it was one of Caruso's favorites.  We have Alagna who would be perfect in this very lyric opera.",1455667200,,1203,4.60093896713615
8719422,4,B00YZGY9F2,"Enrico Caruso sang at the premier of this opera in 1897, launching his career. Since then, every tenor has sung and recorded the famous aria E la solita storia del pastore, commonly referred as Lamento di Federico. Expecting Dimitry Golovnin to compete with the likes of Pavarotti or Domingo is already a tall call, but for director Rosetta Cicchi to ask him to do it leaning on his side evidences a total lack of consideration. For some reason, Cicchi decided that overdramatic acting was needed for the audience to appreciate the opera.  To the contrary: there is no need.  Although Cilea composed this opera at a relatively young age, his music easily conveys the psychological aspects of the story. The recurring motifs are well developed through the opera (in fact, it can be argued that the motifs in Arlesiana are developed in a more sophisticated way than in Adriana Lecouvreur, a later work).  Cucchi created a mood of doom and gloom from start to finish --- where is the idyllic, pastoral background of Provence, where the story takes place?
Since this is the only commercial DVD/BluRay available today, I recommend that opera fans add it to their collection.  Despite my reservations about the choices made by the director, the singers, although not the most famous ones, pour their souls and voice into the characters and the music.  Annunziata Vestri, as Rosa Mamai, does a particularly excellent job in the aria Esse madre e un inferno.  The recorded image and sound are of the quality expected from a BluRay recording.",1452643200,,1533,4.899613899613899
8719423,3,B00YZGY9F2,"Play it without the video. The singers are very good and the Lamento beautifully sung and acted. One is not suppose to see the Arlesiana but she appears everywhere. There are so many ridiculous things in this production. Rosa Mamai's aria ""Esser madre e un inferno"" could have been better served without the baby carriage. Baldassare's ""Come due  tizzi accesi"" went almost unnoticed if one remembers Tito Gobbi's interpretation. And what was the idea of Vivetta's plastic box?",1442620800,,476,5.102564102564102
8719424,4,B00YZGY9F2,"Most of us know ""Lamento di Federico"" from aria albums. This ""germ"" appears throughout the opera and Cila uses it inventively to relay information about various characters as they chat in recits above this music. The ""concept"" of the director, Cucchi, was like her name, (kooky). The singers were terrific, Annunziata Vestri has a large and impressive voice as the Mother, Federico is handled sympathetically by Dmitry Golovnin. Mariangela Sicilia is a beautiful Vivetta, made so vulnerable. Why was she forced to disrobe and then redress while singing? And to reach around to zip a skirt AND tuck in a blouse in while singing? Really? Her carrying silkworms nearly the entire time bordered on bizarre. In fact, many of these characters were certifiable. Perhaps that was the (lost) point the director was trying to make. The Shepherd's lament is sad, Federico is sad, Vivetta is sad, Mother is sad, L'innocente. In fact, no one is functioning well in this particular cast of characters. The last act set, half jail, half insane asylum is cold and confusing. Rosa Mamai bending over a baby carriage was strange stage business. One of the most wasted ""ideas"" was the overture being used to ""tell the story"" ahead of time. It was short enough to let us sit there, adjust to Cila's harmonic palette. This l'Arlesiana woman is never to be seen. But we saw her in the ""overture,"" she was in the windows of the house, she was every woman in the chorus... all of their wigs were the same as her wig. The singularly most wasted stage gestures were as the chorus grabbed at Federico through mesh walls, somehow ""illustrating his inner conflict?"" No. This was the FIRST l'Arlesiana on DVD. It was your responsibility to TELL the story, not ruin it by your interpretation of its symbolism. If you want to own this opera, I'm I would recommend waiting. If you want to SEE it, sure, why not?",1442188800,,1878,4.763803680981595
8719425,5,B00YZGY9F2,"I, for once, accepted the staging and the whole production.  The uniform excellence of the entire cast more than made up for it.,They renewed my faith in the persistence of Verismo, which I lov, and of opera in general.  The music is simply ear candy. A pity nothing else of Cilea survives on DVD except Adriana Lecouvreur..
I have seen it again.  Anunciatta Vestri and dmitry Golovnin are two of the very best newcomers in years.  Verismo deserves a comeeback and productions that are recorded on DVD.  I have more than 3 dozen verismo operas on CD's--many simply exquisite--but only a handful of workworses on DVD.",1440720000,,616,4.773584905660377
8719426,4,B00YZGY9F2,"I'll admit at the start of this review that I've had a soft spot for this opera ever since I heard it, decades ago, via the 1950s recording with Tagliavini & Tassinari in leading roles. While most opera-goers are familiar with the Act 2 tenor aria -- and possibly even the mezzo-soprano's aria in Act 3 -- the rest of the work is not so well-known, even though Cilea's ""other opera"" ""Adriana Lecouvreur"" has been performed at the Met, La Scala, & many other major opera houses.
So, I was certainly intrigued by the prospect of actually watching this complete opera, on a DVD at least, and must confess mild disappointment, mainly due to my inability to accept some of the oddities of this production. For one thing, I don't understand the significance (if any) of having Vivetta holding what appears to be a small fish tank at various points in the opera. And is there a reason why Metifio has a hand missing? Or why Federico has a ""double"" present every now & then? More importantly, we get to see the girl from Arles (""L'Arlesiana"") a few times, understandably mute, but still visible even though strictly speaking she never appears in the opera itself or actually interacts onstage with any of the characters. In my opinion, it's enough that Federico is totally obsessed with her, and this obsession is strongly conveyed throughout the entire opera without us ever having to actually see the woman herself.
Perhaps those observations hardly matter, because the performers here (largely unknown) are terrific! While perhaps not possessing the most purely beautiful voices imaginable, they ALL give tremendously moving & heart-breaking performances. I would definitely recommend this DVD, especially to those who thrive on the emotional and beautiful music that was written by Cilea, Mascagni, Puccini, and others of their ilk.",1439769600,8,1828,4.977124183006536
