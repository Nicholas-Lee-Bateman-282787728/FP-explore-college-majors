1233871,5,B00000JLWR,"Hell Night is one of those 80's slasher films that dares not to show any skin. I'm not really sure what Leonard Maltin's idea of a good movie is. He says it has no nudity or explicit violence, so thus, it has no audience.  Well, who says a movie of that nature has to have those elements to be  enjoyed? I saw it as a young teen and it scared me silly.",939254400,3,352,3.875
1233872,5,B00000JLWR,"The movie opens with four fraternity pledges having to spend one night in an eerie mansion, in order to gain entrance into their sorority. The reason the mansion is eerie is because many years before, the mansions owner  massacred his entire family except for one son. The legend says that many  believe the son to still be alive and living in the mansion. Unknown to the  four pledges, outside the mansion the three pranksters who are responsible  for the initiation, trying to play some pranks on the pledges are  gruesomely dispatched of one by one. It looks like it is up to Linda Blairs  character of Marty to try and make it out alive with the other three  pledges, Jeff, Seth, and Denise. This film is one of the all time greats  ranked right up there with the classic Halloween.",933552000,2,786,4.564285714285714
1233873,5,B00000JLWR,"The movie opens at a frat house holding a pre-initiation party. The two fraternity pledges are joined by two pledges from a sister sorority to pass their final ""test"". They must stay the night alone in the eerie  Garth Manor. The four are led to the house and are told the muderous legend  of the house. All the children of a wealthy reclusive couple  are born  mentally retarded and/or horribly deformed. This leads the head of the clan  to kill the entire family one night years ago. Almost all the bodies are  found leading to the legend that a few still walk the halls. The pledges  divide up into the typical two groups to ""spend the night"" after  being locked inside the grounds. The intoxicated antics of the one couple  add humor to the movie! Not long after they are left in the house the  fraternity president returns with two co-horts to activate electronic  devices and pranks to scare the pledges. The fun is short lived as the  legendary missing Garth child makes an appearance and begins to pick off  people one by one. The movie is alot better than many of the movies in the  genre. It's use of the scenery in the house makes it alot more interesting  than camp counselors running through dark woods. The macabre  ""legend"" reminds the watcher of something you might hear around a  bonfire. All in all a very good movie to add to a collection if only to  have something out of the ordinary.",932860800,2,1405,4.507936507936508

1233919,5,B00000JLWR,"One of the better movies from the 1980's except for Linda Blair, God she is awful. I beg you not to get to far into trying to make sense of a movie from the 80's, There were what they were. This one was a cut above in my opinion and again that is taking the story and the plot and the acting with a hill of salt. Vincent Van Patten and Kevin Brophy are helping out here and doing a fine job. Especially Vincent. I ask that if you decide to give this one a whirl you do so with tongue firmly in cheek and let's give the word Major motion picture a pass and just fly with this by the seat of your pants.

1233937,4,B00000JLWR,"A favorite from the early pay-cable days, Hell Night (1981) is a slasher on training wheels, keeping the sex and gore to a minimum while still providing some predictable jump scares in a gorgeous gothic environment.  Linda Blair is likely the click bait for modern audiences, but the tone of the film is a far cry from her turn in The Exorcist.  Here she leads a likable cast through a formulaic monster film that feels almost family friendly...in an R-rated sort of way.

All prospective pledges from Alpha Sigma Rho are forced to spend one night in Garth Mansion; a sprawling but decrepit estate where 12 years earlier the owner murdered his deformed family then hung himself.  Marti (Blair) and her three fellow pledges are prepared for pranks - recorded screams and phony skeletons all prearranged to scare them into embarrassment.  But soon people begin dying for real, and Marti must take on the surviving residents of Garth Mansion if she ever expects to survive Hell Night!

Some films succeed despite themselves.  And Hell Night should have been a real bore, recycling the trapped-in-a-sorority scenario that had been kicked around since Bob Clark's Black Christmas.  But, unlike most horror films, it's not just the final girl that's likable this time around.  The rest of the cast - including Peter Barton, Vincent Van Patten and Suki Goodwin - are all genuinely endearing characters that we want to make it out alive.  And the setting - a modern-day take on the traditional Gothic haunted house - is a nice change of pace from summer camps and suburbia.

Director of photography Mac Alhberg beautifully arranges a candlelit maze of secret passages, overgrown gardens and rooftop sets cloaked in perpetual night.  And director Tom DeSimone, in his first gig outside of the XXX market, works overtime to impress with extended dolly shots and assorted showy camera moves.  There's nothing here that hadn't been done before - or done better.  But there an inexplicable ""let's-put-on-a-show"" enthusiasm to the proceedings the eventually wins your over.  Those looking for serious blood and guts can do better.  But Hell Night scratches a nostalgic itch for horror fans of a certain age...and would probably serve as a good introduction to those looking to pass the torch.

Scream Factory's Blu-ray/DVD combo is a 4K transfer of the best surviving 35mm print.  And, while it certainly doesn't look like a ground-up restoration, it's a solid presentation of this oft-requested title.  Film damage and quality shifts are common (some standard-def segment were used to fill in the blanks) but I can't imagine anyone complaining...particularly when the extras are this stacked.  Bonus features include new - and lengthy - interviews will the entire original cast, director Tom DeSimone, producer Bruce Cohn Curtis, writer Randolph Feldman, the special effects team, production designer and a tour of Kimberly Crest, the original shooting location.  An audio commentary with Blair and the cast is also packed in along with trailers, radio spots and a still gallery.  It's one heck of a collector's package any way you cut it.",1513728000,11,3126,5.076320939334638

1233981,5,B00000JLWR,"A wonderful gem from the early 1980s horror, (1981). Linda Blair stars as a sorority pledge that has to spend the night in Garth Manor along with 3 others seeking pledges. They have about 6 hours, for which to stay alive until Dawn. Unknowing to them though, the President of Alpha Sigma Ro fraternity and his little gang of thrill seekers are out to make their night not so quiet. They have set up pranks and noise makers in parts of the mansion. What THEY all don't know is that 2 of the original house members are still alive and living underneath the mansion in a maze of tunnels.
Good 80s horror movie here with Linda Blair (The Exorcist, The Exorcist II, The Scariest Places on Earth) embarking on her 80s horror debut.

Great film score combined with analog keyboards and natural instruments. Other reviewers explained the plot which may sound basic but there's alot of dark atmosphere to Hell Night.

I liked this movie and it was better than I thought it would be. It is suspenseful, but lacks the blood splatter. I always felt not horror movies had to have tons of blood to be good. This movie does get your attention in several scenes and it will make some jump. For a low budget horror flick, I liked it. It wasn't cheesy and it didn't lack on the chills. I'm not saying all horror fans will like it; but give it a try; because you might be surprised.

While the movie description on the back cover appears to be in some form of oriental writing and the film is said to have Korean subtitles available, this is the good ol' English version of the movie you've been looking for. The interactive menu has ""play movie"". ""select scene"" and ""select subtitle"", but no other special features.  So many places have price gouged on this film because it's considered ""OOP"" (Out of print), I wondered if I'd ever find a dvd copy to replace my old VHS one. Thankfully, this one is at a fair price, considering, and the video quality is outstanding!  This looks SO much cleaner than my old VHS copy. I'm picky about my picture and sound quality and this dvd surpasses my expectations. I can't wait to share this classic with my kids now.

Tonight, a group of fraternity and sorority pledges must spend the night in Garth Manor on the anniversary of the killings.

1234039,5,B00000JLWR,"Set amidst a wild party, four pledges are subjected to spending the night in Garth Manor* in order to join their respective fraternities and sororities. A lusciously nubile Linda Blair portrays 'Marti Gaines' {a ""'satanic' mechanic"", as it were...}, and her would-be companion Peter join another couple in braving the entire evening in a house where a familial slaughter occurred upon this twelfth anniversary - it is said that there is one surviving member still lurking somewhere on the bowels of the mansion. Ironic that while 'Jeff Reed', the Alpha Sigma Rho Fraternity President relates the story on the way to the house, the character perishes in the manner described of Raymond Garth by hanging, but at the hands of 'Andrew', considering the mocking hanging motion and goofy choking noise.

While Marti remains rather demure in her Victorian gown, the other two are real ""party animals"" so to speak, with he a surfer and she a 'party girl' {she even comes with her own hidden flask of Jack Daniels, and music}, even though admonished to not have any intoxicants for their stay, but they make the best of it anyway.

Predictably, some of the other fraternity members have rigged the place with spooky noises and horror special effects, like a hologram of the zombified ghost of Raymond Garth, and a projection through a mirror. Doubts as to whether or not the remaining Garth Family member exists are abated when despite the pranks, strange occurrences still take place, and are individually killed, including the jokers. Seems the boy has grown into quite a monster, yet he still keeps the rest of the family deep in his subterranean chamber.

Even though Seth manages to escape over the well-spiked gate, running about town until stealing a car, no one believes him, so he absconds with some firearms from the local Police station ready to face the monster and save his friends, but to no avail.

1234058,3,B00000JLWR,"Well, I had to title this review something! ""Hell Night"" is one of those lost horror films from my youth that I have been trying to track down, among many others, to see again, since so many are not available in stores anymore, and showings on T.V. are non-existent. Thank god for Amazon. Now that I have finally gotten my mitts on the movie, how does it fair from what little I remember? Let's get started....

""Hell Night"" is about 4 pledges, two guys, two girls, who are trying to get into their respective fraternity/sorority. With only two pledges for each, how good can they be? Anywho, the initiation the four must go through is a doozy. They are taken to Garth Manor, a large, spooky abandoned house/castle. Years ago, Papa Garth murdered his wife and children, but one child, a mutant, was left untouched and is still thought to be dwelling inside the manor. The pledges have to spend the night in the place until sunrise. You know the rest.

Released in 1981, amidst the peak of the slasher movement, ""Hell Night"" is a decent little thriller. It doesn't re-invent the wheel, but it tries to be something a little different than the typical slashers, and the setting helps with that. One of the main fun parts about these types of movies, especially ones from this era, is the atmosphere. ""Hell Night"" certainly delivers that aspect of the genre in spades. The house itself is expectedly eerie. The outside, filmed in all the darkness it can, looks like the quintessential horror movie house. The inside, which I believe to be a set, is as equally intimidating. Director Tom De Simone makes real good use of the location, the dark, corners, secret passageways, etc. They really don't make them like this anymore! The movie looks appropriately spooky, and De Simone films some pretty effective ""jump scares"", one in particular really caught me off guard. The final few minutes of the film, where our villain meets his end, is clever and a lot of fun. Probably my favorite part of the entire movie. There are some decent scares here, and the mood of the film is pretty cool. As far as violence and gore, it would be considered pretty tame nowadays. It's not really dripping with blood, and there is no nudity. Two things that usually define these types of movies. Still, it has enough great atmopshere and scenes that, even if you are there looking for the blood and boobs, you will still be pleasantly surprised.

Cast-wise, the actors are a little more adequate than your typical slasher fare. Granted, no one is going to win an Oscar in one of these things, but this group are a little better in the acting department, and you actually kind of like them. That cast being the one and only Linda Blair, Peter Barton (Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter), and Vincent Van Patten, son of ""Eight Is Enough"" star Dick Van Patten.

""Hell Night"" suffers from slow moments where characters take their time walking around the location, and sometimes it feels like forever, but there is enough good here that the movie delivers for a fun, entertaining night of a throwback cult classic film.",1326412800,4,3089,4.683241252302026
1234059,4,B00000JLWR,"Right off the bat we must admit that Linda Blair deserves an award for her rack action in Hell Night. Like most others have said, it's pretty much the finest feature of the entire film. Surely anyone whose previous image was that of a possessed vomiting girl with her head spinning around is going to look good no matter what. But the rack was an unexpected surprise. With that said the rest of what the film had to offer was pretty top notch. Well top notch if you love B. The acting and storyline was right in that laughable zone we always seek in an 80's slasher flick. The story makes no attempt at explaining who the killer/killers are and why they're killing these young kids. Not even a slight mention. To some that is annoying but to Sid it's just awesome. The more confusing the better.

The story starts off at a full blown 80's jock frat party. It's taking place around Halloween so everyone's suited up. The guys are in their lazy last minute get ups and the girls are dressed like skanks. Guess nothing's changed....and we love it! Outside of this rager it's also pledge night, in which four hopefuls will spend the night in a haunted house. Pretty cool idea. So we have two guys and two chicks (one being Linda Blair) shacking up in a creepy haunted mansion for the evening. Once their they realize there's more the just some poorly rigged scares going on. The place has a couple of freaky looking lunatics lopping heads off. Obviously Linda Blair plays the ultimate survivor the whole film, and you get to watch her and her rack fight for their lives.

Despite a lot of poor reviews, Hell Night was a really good 80's B slasher flick. Perfect for a Halloween time viewing. Yeah the acting is a nightmare and the plot is all over the place. But that's where the beauty lies. Anyone can go watch a great movie. It's way more enjoyable to watch something you can laugh at the entire time. In addition the a great B effort there was an actual discussion between Linda Blair and her beau about an elf. They had a 5 minute discussion talking about an elf in point shoes and a red hat. We were blown away by this mention. Obviously the films writer knows...he always knows. Possibly his viewing of the world's most disturbing/hilarious Christmas movie ever was the inspiration for Hell Night. Now if you tell us this same guy purchased Death Ring at Pathmark that one night then we're going to freak.",1316822400,,2408,4.495433789954338

1234063,4,B00000JLWR,"Hell Night is a fun slasher flick that takes the slasher carnage away from the high schools and summer camps and puts it in old-dark-spooky-mansion territory.
In the film, four sorority/fraternity pledges must spend the night in Garth Mansion.  Legend has it that ol' Garth had killed his wife and his three impaired kids before killing himself.  But what about the fourth child, Andrew?  Well, legend has it that he's still in the house somewhere, and being a horror film it doesn't take too long for him to show up and make things unpleasant.  He's out to kill everyone on the property and in the end it's up to Peter Barton(the guy who gets his face crushed in the shower by Jason in Friday The 13th-The Final Chapter) and Linda Blair to make the last stand.  A kind of House on Haunted Hill meets The Funhouse if you will.
It's a very well done slasher movie if I may say.  It does suffer from the usual slasher cliches, but thankfully not all of them, and even throws in a few zingers of it's own to catch you off guard.  It actually achieves a bit of creepy atmosphere with it's spooky mansion and underground corridors.  Kills aren't especially gruesome, but just bloody enough.
Linda Blair certainly isn't topping her Exorcist performance here.  She's not terrible or anything, but a little laid back.  Maybe she was stoned throughout the filming.  I've never thought her to be beautiful or anything, but she is cute as hell in this movie.  I just wanna grab her and give her a big hug(and maybe a grope as well).
On that note I'll end the review and think about that some more in private.",1295654400,3,1597,4.526132404181185

Her and a group of frat and sorority pledges must stay the night in a creepy old manor owned by a madman named Raymond Garth who 12 years earlier had killed his entire family and now comes back to exact some more carnage on these helpless kids. I do enjoy the 80s era of slasher films and gave this 3 stars as I think it is only average when compared to others of the same time.

1234065,5,B00000JLWR,"I first saw this back on television in the mid 80's and numerous times there-after till it ""dropped"" out of site in the wake of the SCREAM hit's & imitations that followed in the 90's. I only just viewed it again recently on YOUTUBE and rushed to get it on video.......OMG, what a CLASSIC!!!!!!

A true SCAREfest with a chilling back-story left to the viewer's imagination. It's use of complete nighttime settings, exteriors & photography give it a creepy tone that is just as suspenseful to watch EVEN in the daytime. And there's no attempt at typical Hollywood PC in justifying the killer's motivations', they are there to be grotesque,horrifying ""monsters"" that remain shadowy throughout coming out only to create mayhem and in effectively brief shots ala John Carpenter's Classic HALLOWEEN! Watching it now, I couldn't help but wonder if ""Andrew"" wasn't/isn't the ""uncredited"" inspiration for today's characters like ""Pluto"" (HILLS HAVE EYES remake) or ""Jason"" (that FRIDAY The 13TH piece of JUNK-remake)as he's scary to behold without so much prosthetics applied, just enough makeup & wardrobe to give him a TRUE 'ghoullish' look....SORRY if I spoiled it to this point!!!

HELL NIGHT works because it achieves its goal in being made- a truly effective & creepy splatter film, using just basics to scare the audience and catch them/you off-guard with surprise shocks even when you know it is comming. A ""remake"" may be just around the corner but it'll most likely be made by some NO-talent MTV music video director who'll emphasize blood & guts but didn't go to REAL film school.",1265414400,3,1583,5.015209125475285

1234070,5,B00000JLWR,"On a typical college campus, ""Hell Night"" is in full swing as a fraternity/sorority party moves on to their annual initiation ceremony at an abandoned mansion. Two male and two female pledges now must spend an entire night locked in the grounds of the old house, the site of a grisly family murder/suicide that left some disfigured bodies unaccounted for. Ample and drop-dead-gorgeous Marti (Linda Blair), dashing Jeff (Peter Barton), surfer-boy Seth (Vincent Van Patten), and British party-girl Denise (Suki Goodwin) now must occupy themselves and each other until daybreak, or at least try to get some sleep, while simultaneously dealing with pranks being played on them by their upperclassmen. But the worst pranks will be those no one was expecting!

The filmmakers behind the '80's horror hit ""Hell Night"" (directed by Tom DeSimone) successfully create an '80's disfigured slasher flick with the beauty and innocence of classic horror, as if Linda Blair at 22 wasn't reason enough to be glued to the screen! The film plays out a great, classic scary story with fine performances and clever moments for the slasher genre, and the beautiful lighting and absence of nudity and gratuitous gore give the film a refreshingly older appeal. ""Hell Night"" fantastically proves how effective a ghoulish-slasher film can be without resorting to the sex and gore factors (the period costumes, the result of a costume party, were a nice touch, especially for a big Hammer fan like me). And, they actually have the sense to get you to like and care about the characters in this one! If you're a fan of '80's horror (or the beautiful Linda Blair), this one is definitely a keeper! The Anchor Bay DVD, with enhanced widescreen picture, includes the theatrical trailer, two TV spots, text bios, and a great commentary with Linda, director Tom DeSimone, and producers Irwin Yablans and Bruce Cohn Curtis.

1234071,4,B00000JLWR,"""Hell Night"" stars adorable, vivacious Linda Blair of ""Exorcist"" fame.  She must spend the night in the abandoned, decrepit Garth manor along with three other sorority and fraternity pledges.  Members of Sigma Phi Rho have rigged the house to emit spooky sounds and images.  Unknown to them all, Garth Manor is not as abandoned as it appears.  A deranged mongoloid remains and is determined to kill all intruders using a number of gruesome weapons.  Who will survive this night of hell?

  This slasher flick from the eighties is great to watch on Halloween or on any stormy night.  In fact, the producer, Irwin Yablans, who brought us ""Halloween"" also co-produced this fright fest.  The gothic Garth manor, huge and creepy, is the perfect setting for murder and mayhem.  It is surrounded by a spiked fence with gates that are locked, trapping the pledges within.  The chase scenes within the maze of hedges are accentuated by suspenseful music; they reminded me of Elke Sommer being pursued in Mario Bava's ""Baron Blood.""

  Good performances are given by all, especially Blair.  Vincent Van Patten, however, grew annoying as the wise cracking surfer dude.  I was disappointed that the film didn't have a higher body count since Anchor Bay described it as "" . . . an `80s body-count classic.""  The ending was shocking and violent.  The last still frame of a stunned Blair slowly walking away from the manor was memorable.

  ""Hell Night"" is worth seeking out if you enjoy good slasher fare such as ""Halloween,"" ""The Last House on Sorority Row,"" ""Prom Night,"" and ""Terror Train.""  Watching this movie will make you think twice about trespassing on someone else's property at night.",1225843200,2,1681,4.925
1234072,5,B00000JLWR,"It took me a while to catch up with ""Hell Night""--I saw it on cable long ago, in the 80's, and I remember enjoying it then.  Well, a few intervening years have improved this particular psycho killer on the loose movie.  It might have gotten three stars from me then, but now it's so much fun that it rates five stars.  Why do deformed people lurking inside abandoned houses go on mad murdering sprees?  Well, in these movies, they just do.  That's what you paid your five bucks for, and that's what you get.

We have our standard setup--fraternity pledges must spend a night in a creepy old haunted house.  Of course, there really IS something very evil and dangerous in the house, and the pledges find they are in a dire situation.  A night of horror ensues.  ""Hell Night"" delivers the goods fairly well, and rates up there with ""The Funhouse"" as a well-produced, nice looking slasher film with style to spare.

The 80's saw a glut of slasher films after the release of ""Halloween,"" and most of them were wretchedly awful, so the gems stand out, and this is one of the gems.

The acting performances are pretty decent all around.  We have the wonderful Linda Blair, doing a screaming, cleavage-baring Hammer Films-style damsel-in-distress bit, sure to satisfy fans of that sort of thing.  Vince Van Patten steals the show for a few reels when his surfer/party animal character ""Seth"" suddenly grows a brain and LEAVES THE SPOOKY OLD HOUSE as soon as he realizes there is a real killer on the loose.  Seth then goes on to alert the authorities, procure a weapon, and return to the house to save his buddies.  This is all very entertainingly bizarre for an 80's horror film because in most of these things, there are no characters so sensible and proactive.  Van Patten literally has to be seen to be believed.  The various supporting players also do well.

The spooky old house itself is a combination of two houses (one for the exterior scenes, one for the interiors) and some sets built on a stage for special business (catacombs below the house, hair-raising rooftop action, etc.).  The DVD is a little murky at times, but the house is one of THE best spooky houses ever presented in a film.  I think it rivals Hill House from the original ""The Haunting"".  There, I said it.

Finally, although there is a good bit of blood and gore, the film has an admirable sense of restraint and never goes overboard in that department.  Graphic violence is usually only quickly shown, and this helps the character performances stay in proper focus.  This is what they call ""class,"" guys.

A very nice-looking, well-acted horror film.  Don't buy that new stuff they are calling horror films; all that new stuff is garbage.  Get your microwave popcorn popping, and give this one a spin.",1214092800,10,2774,4.654320987654321

 This review contains an obvious spoiler.
I didn't think I would like this movie when I heard about it.

""WAS I EVER WRONG""
Hell Night has all the elements needed for a great
slasher movie, Sexy people, good kills and a freaky killer on the loose..
I personally love movies where the killer is in some way disfigured yet still human and in this movie that scenario is delivered.

Sorority and Fraternity newbies spend the night in Garth Manor Known for its legend about Raymond Garth and his deformed children and how he killed them all and then himself  .Supposedly Andrew Garth The most hideous of the children escapes being killed and lives in tunnels under Garth Manor ""so the legend goes"".

Linda Blair is all grown up and quite the good heroine also starring the FINE Vincent Van Patten and cute Peter Barton.

The final showdown between Blair and the villain is grade A entertainment and the rest of the movie does not disappoint either.",1171238400,7,957,4.666666666666667
1234075,1,B00000JLWR,"The cover says 'Hell Night', Pray for Day as the tagline, I was praying for this movie to end- Thats how boring it was. This was one of the recommended films in 'Fangorias 101 Horror Movies youve never seen' book. Most of the ones ive seen so far have been good but this one stunk.

Plot- starring Linda Blair, this was one of the things that attracted me to the movie because we all know Linda from the great horror film The Exorcist so I figured she would be good in this one too, to my suprise, far from it. Though the actors didn't have much to work with as far as dialogue. A very familiar plot- one dark night 12 years ago, a madman butchered his family in their mansion before killing himself. 'Legend has it' one child survived the slaughter and remains hidden in the house as a deformed monster. Halloween night a group of fraternity and sorority pledges must spend the night in Garth Manor on the anniversary of the killings.

This film was very slow moving, the acting was terrible. Mostly a bunch of unknowns except Linda Blair and it wasn't at all scary. This was a bad horror film.

1234077,4,B00000JLWR,"Yet another slasher film, but a good one.

Well, they're ALL good.  But this is even better than most, mainly because Linda Blair and Peter Barton lend depth and sympathy to their characters despite some hokey dialogue.

It's initiation time on fraternity/sorority row.  Four pledges must prove themselves worthy by spending the night at Garth Mansion, a huge abandoned estate.  Years ago, Daddy Garth killed his wife and three mutant kids.  The fourth mutant kid was never found.  Legend has it he still stalks the mansion ...

Here's something odd.  There are only four pledges: two guys (Barton and Van Patten) and two gals (Blair and Goodwin).  Since when do fraternities and sororities hold joint initiations?  And they are bid farewell on their initiation by a HUGE party.  This implies a great many brothers and sisters.  Yet at the rate of two pledges per year, the fraternity and sorority would each be down to eight members each within four years.

I guess director de Simone simply wanted lots of people at the party, but only two couples at Garth Mansion.  I guess it's spookier (and cheaper) with just four pledges, never mind making sense.

Okay, I don't mind.

What's important is that the four kids are locked behind the tall iron gates of Garth Mansion, three upperclassman sneak in to scare them ... and the body count mounts!

The script and lead performances are a bit better than standard slasher fare.  Barton portrays a sensitive rich boy.  Blair is the poor girl with a heart of gold.  She's also virginal, at first keeping Barton to his own bed, later cuddling and sleeping with him ... but just sleeping.  Both keep their clothes on.  Meanwhile, Van Patten and Goodwin fornicate like rabbits in the next room.

Guess which couple is killed first?  And guess who survives the night?

Blair and Barton perform well, but Van Patten and Goodwin also add some dimension to their clich?d supporting roles: the [...] cutup and the sleazy party girl.  Brophy, Neumann, and Sturtevant play the jerky upperclassman who sneak in to scare the pledges.  They also provide much needed slasher-fodder.  I liked Jenny Neumann in Stage Fright (aka Nightmares, Australian 1980), but she's under-utilized here.

Hell Night strikes tried-and-true horror psycho notes like a well-tuned instrument.  One girl is pulled screaming down into a hole (although my favorite hole-dragging is in The Unseen, 1980).  The psycho seems indestructible.  They shoot him, but he keeps on going ...

But there are also some surprises, which is no small feat in this tradition-bound subgenre.

Cinematography and lighting are used to good effect.  Shapes emerge from the dark, slowly, indistinct.  Creeping up behind our unsuspecting heroes.  Makeup is also simple but noteworthy.  When we finally see him, the mutant resembles Nosferatu's Max Schreck.

The final scenes are visceral, even brutally poetic.  1981 was a good year for horror psychos, and Hell Night is prime vintage.",1145491200,33,2969,5.014373716632443

1234083,3,B00000JLWR,"[good things]

First off I will point out two things that I personally liked. One being Linda Blair (definitely not as much as I liked her in Savage Streets). She was still hot, and did a great job in the movie. Second, I also liked Peter Barton (Doug in Friday The 13th IV) in this, and again, Peter did a phenomenal job.

Other things that I really liked was the story. The whole underground tunnel thing, really. The killer was also really scary, and one of the things I can remember faintly about this when I watched it as a kid was the killer. If you get past all of the slow and boring parts of the movie, these are the things that really stuck out for me.

As far as memorable kills go, there weren't many, but the head decapitation was not only very well done, but very impressive.

[the bad]

The whole Fraternity/Sorority thing (even at this time, and especially now) was already done. The intro to the movie was very familiar, and very similar to the beginning of Terror Train, which was a better movie all together. The beginning also delivered the slowest and boring 25 minutes of the movie.

[final thoughts]

The first time I saw this movie, it must have been 1985, it scared the crap out of me. I rented it a second time in 1990 with the same results. Watching it again in 2006, it didn't have nearly as much as an impact as it did back then, but it was still a fun watch. Much like Terror Train, the movie starts off slow. I compare it to Terror Train, because I felt that both openings were very similar.

This time aound, I really didn't find the movie as great as I once did, but I grew to appreciate the characters played by Linda Blair and Peter Barton a lot more. The movie does supply us with a pretty creepy killer, one that looks pretty insane. It also proves us with some really neat kill, however without much blood.",1139616000,,1844,4.309248554913295

1234095,5,B00000JLWR,"I'm a horror fanatic. This is one of those horror movies i love to watch over and over, especially during Halloween. Of course this movie is timeless. It isn't dated cuz the characters are all wearing halloween costumes while pledging for the nite at the mansion. The only dated thing is the hair. This was released after the success of Halloween, The Hills Have Eyes, and Friday the 13th. Hell Night is one of the best knockoff slasher flicks of the 80's. Next comes the Prowler and  Madman.  Other knockoffs that aren't really good are the following: Prom Night, Funhouse, Terror Train, Girls Nite Out, Just Before Dawn, The Burning, The Forest, The House That Dripped Blood, Maniac, He Knows You're Alone, Happy Birthday To Me, etc. The list goes on and on like the Energizer bunny rabbit.  This movie is very atmospheric and eerie like all the Italian horror movies like Lucio Fulci, Dario Argento, Amando Osssorio. And it has great cinematography. Which is missing in today's American horror movies. And the screenplay is well written. The movie has some great dialog for a horror movie. It's not just some stupid one-liners like Paris Hilton's House of Wax. House of Wax remake basically copied Hell Night. But Hell Night is far superior. Linda Blair from the Exorcist 1973 stars in this movie. This movie doesn't have alot of elaborate gore like other slasher flicks but the movie didn't need it to be successful. If u like horror movies with girls running around a really eerie haunted mansion type of thing this is for you. Of course the killer(s) were deformed humans like Jason Voorhees but they really died by gunshots and stakes at the end of movie. No sequel here. It seems the best horror movies are the ones that don't have sequels and this is one of them. And this is an A-rated horror movie that was released in drive-ins(the good ol' days) and theatres. Hell Night isn't some sucky direct2video B quality movie. Of course this movie is cliched even back in 1981 but it still works unlike alot of horror movies of the 80's, 90's, 2000's.",1134172800,6,2055,4.7027777777777775

It is the archetypal scary house movie and yes, the characters are stereotypes and look more like they're hitting 40 than college kids, it is a definite must for any old school horror fans. Fortunately, there is no gratuituous T & A, no stupid sex scenes (except one scene which feels like an eternity as the two idiot characters roll around on a bed and do nothing but giggle for like 5 minutes) and just a lot of good,creepy scares that will give you chills. As one reviewer mentioned, this isn't a particularly realistic movie, as the characters act in typical horror movie fashion (going back into the house several times, investigating dark catacombs after they know there's a psycho on the loose, acting pretty calmly after finding out several of their friends are dead, etc.) but the plot twist in this movie could be lost on you as it is somewhat unclear who the killer is. There is a quick revelation by Linda Blair but it is garbled and confused by the monster's banging on the door that it could get missed.  SPOILER: so, if you're somewhat confused by the ending, there were actually two ""monsters"" living in the house (presumably Andrew and Raymond) as we know that only 3 out of 5 bodies were recovered at Garth Manor after the murders. But it is still somewhat unclear to me because we know the guy Seth kills is Raymond, but the monster who throws Jeff out the window and the one that Marty impales on the roof of her car do not look the same at all which leads to me to think that there were actually three psychos in the house?

Excellent use is made of the scary old candle lit house.  The music is excellent as well, reminding me a lot of Friday the 13th music except without the ki-ki-ki.  There are endless scenes of kids slowly walking down dim corridors, anticipating danger around every corner.  This thing is a masterpiece of suspense.

On the minus side, the characters are all paper thin cliches.  There's no character development at all, heck, there's very little dialog considering how much time is spent silently walking down dim corridors.  You've got the surfer dude, the slut, the good girl and the rich, but nice boy.  I just summed up the entire depth and breadth of all the characters in a single sentence.  They're a fairly likable bunch, but it's certainly not like you'll feel any emotional attachment to any of these folks.

We don't even get any T&A in this one - just one girl in her underwear.  She and the surfer dude make out for the first half of the movie.

Overall, I'd recommend it just because of the suspense, but too bad we didn't get better characters.  It's a fairly classic slice of '80s slasher cheese.",1128384000,2,1284,4.669642857142857

1234105,4,B00000JLWR,"""Hell Night"" is an irresistible guilty pleasure from the early 80s slasher cycle, and one of the handful that actually still holds up (for instance, ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Prom Night"" and ""Terror Train"" now seem about as suspenseful as ""My Fair Lady"").

Though the story is lame--pledges spending the night in a haunted mansion--the execution (sorry) is smart: ""blood-dripped"" font in the opening credits, trap doors, secret passageways, a hedge maze, catacombs under the house, a convincing monster, appealing actors, a really creepy ""legend"" that sets the story in motion, and even a little surprise twist regarding the antagonist.  I love that our heroine Linda Blair is in Victorian garb (complete with heaving bosom), being chased around the old Victorian mansion.  Nice touch.  Ditto the scene of the fraternity arriving with torches, a la the ""Frankenstein"" villagers (in fact, the monster even looks like a leaner version of DeNiro's take on Shelly's creature).

I was struck, on my first viewing in almost 20 years, by how instense this movie gets.  The last 20 minutes are quite nerve-wracking.  I remembered the ""rising carpet"" scene vividly from the original release, and it still gives me chills (you should definitely let smart aleck little kids watch this--it will scare the hell out of them).

I'm also struck by how many shockingly bad decisions people in this movie make--like going BACK in the house 2 and 3 times, fully aware of what is waiting inside.  It gets a little ridiculous after a while, though if you are watching with a group it makes for some lively discourse (Of course if they just hid outside in a bush until dawn, like you or I would do, there would be no movie).

1234106,4,B00000JLWR,"So many horror movies came out in the early 1980's that movie makers sometimes had a hard time finding locations and situations that hadn't been used yet.  Sorority and Fraternity initiations were a great way of sticking teens into situations no sane person would go into voluntarily.
Hell Night sticks four unfortunate twentyish kids into Garth Mansion, the site of a grisly family slaughter years before.  The sadistic pledge masters lock the huehuehuege iron gates behind them and inform them they have to stay the night.  The pledge masters then begin setting off special effects they set up earlier to try and scare the four hapless pledges.  As you might guess, there are real horrors inside which start  thinning out the cast.
Linda Blair is the obvious star of the show.  I am a fan of Linda's but for some reason I just get the feeling while watching this that she is disinterested.  In fact early on she seems to be improvising her lines. The GREAT commentary track explains some of this.  Apparently everyone on the set had a great time and was loaded half the time.  The director (Tom DeSimone)and producer (Irwin Yablans who brought us Halloween) are on the commentary as well.  It's obvious everyone got along well and had fun making the film.
Having seen the film before getting the DVD, I really liked the feel of it, although I wasn't sure why.  The commentary hit on something I hadn't considered.  The pledges are all in costumes since the Hell Night festivities were part of a costume party.  The director mentions that this was done so they could logically dress the characters in gothic, period costumes without having to make an actual period film.  The old mansion (a real location, not a set) combined with set lighting done almost exclusively with candlelight along with period costumes gives a very gothic, primative feel to the film.
There are a few scenes of gore, but they are usually very, very fast cuts.  The trap door in the floor scene rates as one of the all time great suspense scares.
It would be easy to dismiss a lot of the horror films of the early 80's, and to be fair, there were many stinkers, but Hell Night holds genuine entertainment value (and not in a Mystery Science Theater kind of way).  The movie is available in a double feature collection with the film Fade To Black.

1234111,4,B00000JLWR,"That head-spinning little girl from THE EXORCIST (1973), Linda Blair--now all grown-up and gorgeous and causing all the guys' heads to spin--stars in HELL NIGHT, a surprisingly well-made and entertaining hybrid of the teen slasher film and the gothic ghost story.  Blair plays Marti, one in a quartet of college students who are required to spend the night in a dilapidated old mansion as part of the initiation rites for joining a fraternity or its sister sorority.  Rumors have it that the mansion is haunted by the sadistic late owner or, even worse, that it may be inhabited by the late owner's hideously deformed and depraved son.  Unfortunately for the four Greek-house pledges, some of the rumors are true....
In spite of the bum rap that HELL NIGHT often gets for riding in the wake of John Carpenter's highly successful HALLOWEEN (1978), it is actually a very well-written, literate film that rises above the teen-slasher clich&eacute; by combining the sub-genre with elements from the classic ghost-story format.  Not only are the teens being pursued by a deformed maniac killer, but all the action takes place within the confines of an old gothic manor house that seems to be afflicted by the supernatural.
HELL NIGHT has some pretty good scares that might make even the seasoned horror buff jump.  The sets of the manor house interiors create an appropriately spooky atmosphere, and the creature what does the slashin' is creepy enough to rival both Michael Myers and his cinematic cousins Jason and Freddy.  And Marti (Linda Blair) gives the creature his final comeuppance in a most satisfying and grisly way.
Most of the acting in this film is pretty good, too.  No stranger to horror films, of course, the beautiful Linda Blair does an excellent job.  She comes across as being genuinely frightened, jiggles in all the right places (a necessary requirement for the principal female in teen horror films), and screams quite effectively.  Co-star Vincent Van Patten flashes his killer abs and flexes his biceps quite adequately (a requisite for at least one male lead in teen horror films), so he does an adequate job portraying the group's jock.  The son of actor Dick Van Patten (better known as the father on TV's EIGHT IS ENOUGH), viewers may also recognize him from his various movie roles (e.g., Tom Roberts in ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL) and TV parts (e.g., the titular role in THE BIONIC BOY and a stint as Christian Page on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS).  Also notable is actor Peter Barton, whom many older female viewers may remember swooning over when he played the titular roles on TV's THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STAR (c. 1982) and, more recently, BURKE'S LAW (c. 1994).
Though they perform quite adequately in HELL NIGHT, most of the other actors are relative unknowns and did not go on to do any other TV or cinema work of note. It is unfortunate that the public has not seen more of Ms. Suki Goodwin, who portrays the fourth member of the quartet of pledges.  Not only does her work here indicate that she has talent and potential, she is also quite pretty and has a sexy British accent.  If nothing else, it would've been nice to see her become another famous horror-movie scream queen.
HELL NIGHT.  It's a slasher flick; it's a ghost story.  It's two great sub-genres in one!  However it may be categorized, HELL NIGHT is an underappreciated, underrated horror film that deserves a look.  Aficionados of the slasher film will love it, but mainstream horror fans will like it, too.",1067904000,5,3504,4.823038397328881
1234112,1,B00000JLWR,"The movie Hell Night looked ok so I thought I would give it a try,I'm glad it was a rental,this movie [smelled.] First off it is about a group of kids staying in garth manor to get pledged,it takes 40 minutes or so for anything remotely interesting to happen. The death scenes are bland and suffer from getting edited heavily and plot has been done a year ago with Terror Train in 1980 which is actually a good movie about kids in a frat on a train.

1234114,5,B00000JLWR,"Hell Night is definitely an above average horror flick and one of the best horror films ever made, although it is a little dark through some parts and hard to make out what is happening.
The story is that to be initiated into a fraternity and sorority, four people have to stay in a reputedly haunted mansion.
The legend goes that a family used to live in the mansion but the father went crazy and killed his whole family, except Andrew his son, who is now living in secret at the mansion. I don't know what he eats but I couldn't imagine him going to the local supermarket.
There is a neck twisted around so the victim can see his backside here,a decapitation there. One guy goes to the toilet and comes back to bed and finds his girlfriend missing and finds the head of another woman in the bed. This same guy later on manages to climb over the gate of the mansion (the president of the fraternity warns them if they try to climb over the gate to watch their ...) and he goes to the local police station. But it comes to no surprise that the police officers don't believe there have been any murders and threaten to throw the guy in jail for the night if he doesn't leave immediately, if not sooner.
He steals a shotgun from the police station and also steals a car, almost while the owner is driving it and heads back to the mansion.
... It is pretty obvious that they copied Friday the 13th and Halloween when it comes to the hard-to-kill aspect. This movie was made when horror films were in their prime and they knew how to make them, and this one is no exception.
Peter Barton stars in this who went on to star in Friday the 13th the final chapter and also stars the excellent Linda Blair who is worth renting or buying this movie just for her in it. She is in her prime and she is certainly eye candy for the guys.",1048723200,2,1822,4.238505747126437
1234115,3,B00000JLWR,"It's hard not to think that Linda Blair was offered the part in 'Hell Night' in 1981 to cash in on the ever popular 'The Exorcist'.  In 1981 she had recently completed 'Exorcist 2 - The Heretic' so she was the perfect choice to be part of another horror theme.  In this film, she plays the role of a teenager who, along with three others, has to spend the night in a haunted mansion.  It's all part of initiation for their college.  The film has some definite scary moments, although doesn't quite have the punch of Halloween.  And while we're on the subject of Halloween,there are definite moments when you feel that they've borrowed ideas from that film.
Watching 'Hell Night"" again is fun, but I can see why it has been forgotten by so many people. Whether it's because of the pathetic looking zombie maniac or the slowness in the first half of the movie, or the predictable scares ... not sure
Hell Night though  is worth owning if you are a collector of 80's Horror films, but it's far from being the finest horror film made.
DVD EVALUATION:
Anchor Bay have released a clear transfer of Hell Night - and in widescreen too.  You also get the the movie trailer, 2 TV spots and commentary form Linda Blair and production executives. I was disappointed that the soundtrack was only in Mono.  Considering other horror films have been remastered to 5.1 mix, I felt this let the film down.  A 5.1 mix helps create atmosphere.",1042848000,3,1423,4.52734375
1234116,3,B00000JLWR,"well, i saw it and enjoy it since i am a linda blair fan and taking a glimps at her is like watching an angel battling the evilist evils that she may encounter. the film is off the wall funny more then scary yet the scariest part for me is when she open that drawer and fake snakes pop out...i scream on that part but other then that, it was jus soso. No wonder Vince Van Patton never got famous, since his acting, or overacting, i should say, is as fake as Vanilla Ice. Linda did get a small role in scream but it would of been better if she had replace courtney cox as the lead newsperson on that show, as she has a long following in this type of horror movies. Rent it...",1039910400,,674,4.0
1234117,5,B00000JLWR,"This movie should be up there with the likes of ""Halloween"" as a classic of the genre. Unlike most of the slasher flicks of the eighties, ""Hell Night"" is not full of gruesome special effects and blatant nudity. Instead the movie relies on suspense, and it does this very well.
Let's face it, the story is not the most original, 4 sorority pledges have to spend 1 night in ""Garth Manor"" to gain entry to their chosen fraternities. Some of their peers set out to make it a night full of frights, but as is turns out, they needn't have bothered....Garth Manor is truly haunted. Heard it all before ? So have I, but I don't think I have ever seen the subject matter handled so well.
As awful as the deaths are, there is very little blood involved, and I don't think I saw one fake intestine ! The chills however, are plentiful. The setting, a dark, gothic mansion, candlelit and isolated is perfect. The mood is goosebump enticing. The music is eerie and the performances are all good. Of course, Linda Blair shines, as always. Ms Blair plays the nice quiet girl wondering what the hell she is doing in this situation, who turns out to be the only one with the guts to grapple with the monster 1 on 1.
If only more horror movies had attempted to do what Hell Night did. Pick your actors for acting ability rather than willingness to show flesh, and spend some budget on script development and filming techniques rather than bucketloads of blood and gore.
I have been a fan of this film for years and when I bought the DVD was amazed at the difference in picture quality. I actually saw things that I had never noticed on my VHS copy. The DVD also includes a theatrical trailer and amusing and informative commentary with movies makers and Linda Blair also. It also has some background info and filmographies of cast and crew.
I cannot speak highly enough of this movie. I recommend it thoroughly to anyone who enjoys a scary flick, as well as Linda Blair fans. I never tire of watching this brilliant effort !",1031184000,25,2005,4.4659400544959125
1234118,5,B00000JLWR,"The movie ""HELL NIGHT"" was filmed at ""Kimberly Crest"" in Redlands, CA. The house is listed on national ""Haunted Homes"" lists everywhere. Redlands, CA is noted as the town with the highest level of SATANIC WHORSHIP in the country. Some of the events in the movie are based on local stories around Redlands. There are close to 10 hauntings that are active today in Redlands including the house used in ""HELL NIGHT"". During the making of this movie some of us students at the University of Redlands caught wind of the production and watched it unfold. They used our school for some of the scenes. It was very strange though? They would only tape after midnight and in complete secrecy. No security, extras, ect.

Maybe this is for the better though,because many sequels as we know tend to mock and understate their predecessors. Also,this movie has a definitive ending,nothing left to the imagination(and no door left open  for a sequel!). This is one of those eighties gems that thrilled me to find it available on dvd. Starring the great Linda Blair of The Exorcist fame,this movie relies heavily on atmosphere and setting,and shines beautifully in it's approach. I first viewed this film in the early eighties at an allnight drive in,playing alongside Funeral Home and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.(the good old days!). Barely being a teenager,this movie terrified me! If you like older horror movies,you must give this one a chance. I enjoyed the commentary on the dvd as well.

1234122,1,B00000JLWR,"Watching this movie will give you these thoughts as it progresses, 'When will this end?' and 'Is this over yet?' It's bad enough that this flick has no nudity (an 80's slasher flick without nudity? Are you kidding?), but it's not even scary. In fact it's slow moving and boring. Most of this movie is scenes of people walking very slowly, very tediously, and by the time they get to where their going, you've lost interest.
This movie broke the cardinal rule of haunted house movies. A member NEVER escapes, goes for help, then comes back. Well this guy climbs the fence and goes to the police station. The cops think he's a drunk college kid, and send him on his way. Before leaving the police station, he happens to come across an open door leading to a room full of weapons and ammo! He takes a pump action 12 gauge and goes back to help his two surviving friends. He ends up getting killed.
Then Linda and her boyfriend are hiding in a bedroom, armed with a pitchfork. The 'monster' comes in through a trap door (while being covered with a throw rug) and gets stabbed with the pitchfork. He escapes through the floor and is on the run. The boyfriend decides to go after him and get him. Still armed with the pitchfork they take a long, slow walk through the basement caves. After walking what seems forever, they finally see the crazed fiend and run like scared rabbits! So what the hell did you go down there for?
This flick is terrible, makes no sense, has no point, and is a bore through and through. Pass this up at all costs. Even if you see it in a pawn shop for a dollar, pass.",1015286400,2,1588,4.35016835016835

The story, for the record, revolves around a College fraternity pledge night in which a small group of pledges (including Linda Blair) are forced to spend the night in the creepy old mansion called Garth Manor.  Garth Manor is a place with a history, as your typical horror movie plot line would have it, exactly twelve years ago to the night, the Manor's previous resident murdered his whole family.  As the pledges' night rages on with booze and sex, one by one they are stalked and murdered by a mysterious figure.  The murderer this time out is actually rather surprising and refreshing, Hell Night is a definate cut above the majority of 80's killer flicks.  There are some teriffic moments and some genuine suspense.

I still find  this chapter of the movie the scariest thing I have ever seen in any film.  The raw viciousness of the doll, the evil sounds it makes, and the final  scene, all are truly horrifying. I nicknamed the doll ""Cut-Out""  as a kid since it cuts it way out of a suitcase in one part. I was curious  if anyone else found this movie as frightening as I did.
