It has a british mystery Hammer feel and even a british actor as the main character. the
story is typical open up a mummy's tomb but with no mummy walking around just a curse.
Raymond Burr and Eva Marie Saint star in this very good mummy mystery!",1386979200,2,339,4.074626865671642

I just ordered the VHS tape from Amazon as it doesn't seem to be offered in DVD. In fact I ordered a DVD with the same title but is a completely different movie so be careful about ordering this title.  This is a good story about the ever fascinating King Tut curse and has very good stars in it.  It is in no way ""over done"" which is the ""curse"" of many of this type of movie.  Dramatic yes, over done no.  I like the scenes in Egypt. Brings back memories of when I visited Egypt and went to the Valley of the Kings. Hot as hell and the flies would tote you off even in February. If you are ready for a sit back and relax and enjoy movie then this is a good one for you.",1368403200,3,787,3.930817610062893
