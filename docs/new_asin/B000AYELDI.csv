8080577,3,B000AYELDI,"Since Moving Targets is the third Simon Yam film I've seen with a scene in exactly the same caf&eacute; (PTU and Fulltime Killer being the others), I'm beginning to think he owns the place and is supplementing his salary by renting it out as a location. The film itself is a minor and disposable Hong Kong actioner about two cops (one seeking revenge on his father/superior officer) who end up on opposite sides of the law that has the benefit of being for the most part extremely well directed even if there's a lack of focus in the predictable last third that lets down the best of what has gone before.

Easy to watch and just as easy to forget, this at least marks Jing Wong out as a director whose work might be worth further investigation - though a glance at his resume on the IMDB doesn't seem very encouraging, boasting as it does titles such as Raped by an Angel 4 - The Raper's Union, My Schoolmate the Barbarian and Love is a Many Stupid Thing.",1161388800,,956,4.370786516853933
