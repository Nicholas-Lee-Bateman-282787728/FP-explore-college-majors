5184424,4,B008VBSR7S,"Deathship is a classic example of how to use atmosphere and suspense to keep an audience on the edge of their seats. Deathship is about a ship that is haunted by it's former crew, Nazis. The movie does an excellent job of being scary and suspenseful without using a whole of F/X.

5184425,5,B008VBSR7S,"Scorpion Releasing continues with their next exciting genre release, this time a real classic  in the form of a lesser known violent ghost story at sea, Death Ship.

Featuring the always welcome George Kennedy (whom would go on to further 80s horror fare - see the excellent Just Before Dawn) and the ever familiar Richard Crenna, this is a very original horror movie which tells the tale of a group of shipwrecked survivors  that happen upon a rusted out old abandoned ship from the 1930's. They go aboard, as it seems like a chance for survival from the open sea, but they soon realize they are in far more danger on the Death Ship!

While low on atmosphere, this film still does have some - and it's effective. The Nazi element is unsettling and gives cause to the paranormal violence that the survivors have to face. There is a quite memorable scene with the beautiful Victoria Burgoyne in the shower, when a large amount of blood ruins her day. Pretty awesome.

Filming a horror movie on the open sea is always an effective way to set up tension, as established early on with Jaws and other films ad nauseum. However, with Death Ship there is an extra sense of dread in that this time the threat is of a paranormal nature AND you cannot escape because there is still the threat of being lost at sea. In other words, where it lacks in atmosphere Death Ship makes up for in overall dread and fear. Plus, you get a decidedly dark performance from George Kennedy than you are probably used to. Overall though a really great ""haunted-house-on-a-boat"" spook fest that boasts some cool practical effects and decent scares. Definitely a midnight movie.

I have not seen the DVD so cannot compare - I have the Blu Ray, and it looks excellent. Death Ship was a great choice for Scorpoin Releasing's first Blu Ray release.

On a side note, while not advertised on the cover this time,  Death Ship is the latest film to be released under the Katarina's Nightmare Theater line of genre horror releases. It contains both the regular film and the version that she opens and closes. She is silly and charming as usual.

Great buy for  70s/80s horror enthusiasts.",1356134400,19,2151,4.622047244094488

This is one of my favorite of the horror movies they used to show on Saturday afternoons when I was a kid.  I have such fond memories of it that I bought the original movie poster a few years back.  I've worn my VHS to a thin strip and I'm so glad that it now has a proper remastered DVD release, but I'm almost worried about seeing a cleaned up, sharper version!  The ""original"", shown-on-TV copy I grew up seeing was so distorted and darkened that you could barely see the ash covered walls in the interior of the ship.  Like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, something about the poor duplications of the film seemed to make it better - more seedy - more disturbing.

5184442,1,B008VBSR7S,"I had seen this movie more than a few times before and had only the vaguest recollection of the film.  By vague, I mean vague.  I couldn't remember anything other than some scenes had some skeletons and they were on a ship.

When I saw it was now out in HD, remastered and even with some extras on the discs, I had to check it out.  I thought, ""Was this film better than the little I remember?""  The basic idea of a haunted ship out on the seas holds some basic promise built into it and I figured...

I was wrong.  It was only ten minutes into the film when I realized why I only had the vaguest memory of this film, despite having seen it multiple times:  It makes almost no sense.  I do not say that lightly.  It barely makes any sense.

Now, I don't mean that the idea of a haunted ship isn't logical, or call bull[#$*$] on the paranormal aspect...or even that I take issue with some of the necessary stupidity and plot-moving action of characters in a horror movie. (they have to open that door, right?)  I mean from minute to minute, nothing seems to make sense.  I love movies, good and bad.  I am one of those people that enjoy movies that are so-bad-they-are-good - and this is truly one of those gems.  It isn't ""campy"" - it's genuinely, sincerely a mess.

I truly mean this next analogy.  It's not hyperbole.
It's actually like there was all this basic footage filmed for individual scenes and two establishing shots of the ship, and all this film was just thrown on a table in an editing room...and then the intern was pulled in off the front desk of the production company and was suddenly charged with making sense of the film.  ""Sit down, check out all this footage, and throw something together.  We have to have this ready for release in a week or so.  Actually, damn...I mean tomorrow.""

It really is that bad.  Not the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, but in the top five. (or, should I say, bottom five)

That having been said, if you watch this film and were ever are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 - you're going to be so disappointed they never found this film.  But, it's ok they didn't because by the time you're five minutes in you'll have your own running commentary rolling through your head, or between you and your friends.  Every gaffe, continuity error, abrupt transition, wooden piece of dialogue, or crappy music cue will be hard to ignore.  If you're watching this alone and you don't find the humor in how bad it is...you shouldn't be allowed around sharp objects or children.  Something's wrong.",1404950400,,2545,4.428879310344827

The worst part of Death Ship is the waste of George Kennedy.  Careers do go downhill, but this movie isn't worth an actor of Kennedy's talent.  That being said, he did try and is one of the bright spots in an otherwise mediocre movie.

Worth one trip for the devoted.  For those looking for a one time good time, try ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.""",1381017600,,559,4.421568627450981
5184449,5,B008VBSR7S,"WARNING: spoilers ahead

Driven by an unseen force, a rusty World War II German freighter prowls the Oceans in search of hapless victims. One night it encounters a cruise ship somewhere in the Atlantic on slowly heading back to Port. The freighter rams the (cruise)ship at full speed, cutting in half and causing it to sink rapidly; drowning the passengers and crew except for the grumpy captain and a few passengers who survive by clinging to a stage platform. The next day the survivors are floating on the platform and see the freighter anchored. They climb aboard the ship believing and are finally safe.........NOT!! They soon discover a multitude of horrors that lead to gruesome deaths and the spectral force which commands the freighter turns the captain into a madman. I will say no more about the plot(particularly the ending)because you really gotta watch it for yourself. But don't be fooled by the B-movie style cover. This movie is not one of those cheesy horror flicks with terrible special effects and comical zombie monsters. The most compelling horror movies are those where eevil forces are invisible, but deadly. Highly recommended.

For the record: This movie inspired a tacky, Hollywood remake in 2002 titled 'Ghost Ship'. If you saw that, see this one! You will not be disappointed.",1379808000,2,1305,5.009216589861751

We owned an original VHS copy and that was absolute crap - even on on old CRT set.  This new restoration is as pristine as anything that you would see coming out of a modern studio.

Also, the film itself is greatly enjoyable.  Suspense abounds and the actors really make the best of what could have been a very cheesy B-movie horror flick.  No blood or gore, but the results are just as exciting.

But, not as bad as when your picked up by a ghost ship, that possesses the captain and makes him a real monster. And yes, it's an old Nazi ship that has been sailing those waters sinse WW II, and is filled with spooks even more evil than when they were alive.

You can maybe get by with the DVD as nothing really jumped out at me visually with the blu-ray, but it looks good and the movie is a nice creepy film about an old cursed Nazi ship that sinks other ships to obtain any survivors to fuel itself with blood - so i wanted the Blu-ray just because i enjoyed the movie enough to want a best version.",1360108800,4,693,4.282442748091603

It is original, has a well-known cast of good actors and is scary without all the gags, gore and dumb naked bimbos that many of today's so-called horror movies rely on.  The physical appearance and atmosphere of the German death ship is enough to give you the creeps.  This remastered version has a nice clear picture which is a pleasure as some of the older movies have not been offered in DVD's of decent quality.  There is a bonus feature that translates the German that is spoken by the former occupants of the ship into English so you know what is being said during these scenes.  I found this helpful but it sort of took away from the creepiness of having to guess what the voice is saying.  You know how leaving something to the imagination can be more visceral than if it is actually presented.  Either way if you like a good, old fashion horror flick than don't miss this one.  I have watched this movie many times and always get something more from each viewing.

Anyway, the stories about a haunted nazi interegation ship and some people who have to board it after their cruise ship sinks. It was a good movie, but some times things don't stand the test of times and our memories seem to make things better than they really were. It was probably good 30 years ago but it is a bit dated.

It was the second highest grossing film the week it opened. So this was not a made to video film. In fact it did quite well. For one reason , the cast was well known and if you had to pick a movie to go to , why not see richard crenna and george kennedy in  a horror film.  The effects are still strong to see as they used a real rotting ship, that evidently stank really bad as well.  This contains a documentary that interviews the now dead george kennedy and the director , writer and actor nick manusco, who was always underrated imo  The cast managed to do a good job with this film and convey that they were out to sea on a evil nazi death ship.  It also has the fine actress sally ann howe in it.  The film suffers some print damage in the early credits but that quickly fades and then it looks far better , this is the same print they used for both the blu and the dvd.
