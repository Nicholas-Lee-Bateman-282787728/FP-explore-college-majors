7564861,5,B0197C50QU,"As you can tell from the title, the dialogue is filled with double meanings as the devil has come to Religion...Religion, Arizona that is. The town of Religion is holding a high stakes poker tournament. Some of the language is unappealing to Christians: ""The town is going to be bigger than God's illegitimate son.""  Almost a John Lennon quote.

The tournament attracts many colorful characters which make the film worth watching. Saint John (Gary Kohn) is a man of the cloth who is tied to Anton Stice (Claude Duhamel) our dark character looking to gain a soul for the prize of a Cross of Gold. Some characters include Salt Peter (Louie Sabatasso) , a flamboyant morphine addict who is bisexual.  Bootstrap Bess (Holiday Hadley) the town madam and a sure shot. Waylin Smith (Miles Szanto) a man raised by Apaches who has guidance from a spirit. Bobby Shea (Sean Joyce) a quiet man who loves Bess. Prince Zain Mohammad (Merik Tadros) an Arabian Prince of Azir. There is also a reporter who says, ""Freedom is an illusion created by servants to help them sleep at night.""  He notes that the players are treated like gods. An illusionists and a man with finger puppets.

The players have to decide what on earth is worth the price of their soul as the card game plays out. The film is clever and the characters are developed with flashbacks.  4 1/2 stars on this low budget indie.

8744262,3,B0197C50QU,"Enjoyable, even if not the greatest movie. This is a western with slightly mystical/supernatural flair. One word: campy.

This might not appeal to everyone, but its set in the 1870s and has what all good westerns do: grit, beards, bad characters, working vixens, hunky bearded dudes, and ... well, other ... characters. You find it all here.

Sets and photography are pretty decent and thankfully the sound is relatively even throughout, as are the voice-overs. No issues with the production value.

The dialog is definitely western but it won't make you laugh out loud in embarrassment.

What strikes me most about these low(er)-budget movies is that there are only a few extras. Its not like you ever see a town with hundreds of people. Just a few people scattered here and there, as if the town is really a ghost town and they really couldn't pay for tons of extra folks milling about. I guess Main Street really is a cardboard cutout.

Give it a shot.",1515456000,,955,4.728915662650603
