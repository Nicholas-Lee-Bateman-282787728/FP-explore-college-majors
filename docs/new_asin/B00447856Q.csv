4260264,5,B00447856Q,I have all the seasons for a reason! lol that rhymed. Product came way ahead of scheduled date.  The packing was great and product was protected.  Product exceeded expectations.  I will recommend this company to friends and use them in the future. Definitely worth it!,1318377600,,268,4.911111111111111
4260265,5,B00447856Q,"Regardless of the other reviews about the quality of the disks and the extras provided, I felt I needed to chime in and rate the show itself a 5.  THIS IS A GREAT SHOW.  I would watch it with my Grandma or my children.  Sounds corny, but Rob is a great role model... even for me and I'm in my 40s!!",1310515200,,298,3.8524590163934427
4260266,3,B00447856Q,"Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Rob's and all his shows.  With that being said, this DVD set does NOT do him justice.  It feels slapped together in a matter of seconds.  The quality is terrible, like watching a poor quality Youtube video.  This is really disappointing.  I regret buying this now.",1301356800,,303,4.339285714285714
4260267,4,B00447856Q,"This was a great season.  Funny as always.  Shame about the quality of the disc.  If you buy this be careful you do not scratch the discs, as they tend not to play after.  It happened with my nitro circus season 2.",1292284800,,214,4.023809523809524
4260268,2,B00447856Q,"Just as with Fantasy Factory's Season 2 DVD, this is a ""burned when you order it"" release direct from Amazon.com, undoubtedly slim on any extras or universal playability (unless your player supports DVD-R playback, it won't work), again, just as with Season 2.

Once again, it's sad that I have to say how much more this great show and its fans deserve.

PLEASE MTV, give us REAL releases of these seasons, commercial grade, with organized extras, etc. You did it for Rob & Big, you did it for FF Season 1. So how 'bout it??

Ppl, the only way to get real, top-notch releases from MTV is to NOT buy into this DVD-R ""burn as you order"" shortchange.

Awesome show, awful DVD sham.",1286150400,18,678,4.487804878048781

8415934,5,B00447856Q,"I have always enjoyed watching this show ever since the first time I caught it on MTV. I couldn't wait until I had every Season on DVD. This show is very, very entertaining to me. Being a former street-skater myself...I love watching the guys rippin it up. All the skaters on the show are good and fun to watch. The first three Seasons are great and really funny. Season 4 is not quite as good, but I will still buy Season 5 as soon as I can (in the hopes that it is better than Season 4). Overall, I enjoy this program tremendously.",1367798400,,533,4.184466019417476
8415935,4,B00447856Q,"I have all the seasons of Rob and Big as well as Fantasy Factory. Very funny show, if you're a fan it won't dissapoint. I was nervous about it but the DVD-R format looked just fine. There aren't any special features either but I really don't care about those much anymore. Particularily since this season has a couple behind the scenes episodes already.",1358467200,,353,4.619047619047619
