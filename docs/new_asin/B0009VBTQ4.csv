2325017,2,B0009VBTQ4,"I served in the army during operation desert shield and desert storm, so i kinda have an idea of what desert combat looks like.  There haven't been many shows or movies depicting the gulf wars (not since Three Kings and Courage Under Fire) so I was looking forward to this show.  The pilot left me wanting better.  The environment was accurate enough (just find a lot of empty space and sand) the action was pretty good, but the acting was poor. You can tell B acting and C acting when you see it.  But this is the first episode and i will watch the second, because some series do start off slow, so i'm willing to give this one a chance. But make no mistake, this is a fictional entity and shouldn't be mistaken as how war really is. I know that is the intention of the creators of these shows and movies, but there's nothing like the real thing.  The closest i've seen to feeling what war is like is the movie Platoon.  Over There is a far cry from making an accurate depiction of what war is really like. But i like to be entertained and will give the show a fair shot.",1122681600,6,1072,4.204878048780488
2325018,1,B0009VBTQ4,"Being an OIF veteran, I could only stomach about 20 minutes of this show before shutting it off.  The hype and the hope of a decent portrayal of our soldiers' efforts 'over there' got me interested at first, then severely disappointed in the actual product.

Besides the trivial inaccuracies that are inherent in any Hollywood production of reality, the characters are all conveyed as victims of their given and chosen circumstances.  This is in stark contrast to the majority of soldiers that accept their duties for what they are, and try to make the best of a miserable situation any way they can together as a team.

Furthermore, the characters typify nearly all of the possible generic stereotypes with the exception of the dumb, poverty-stricken redneck that can 'shoot the hair off a bullfrog'.  Every character lacks depth or emotion and are wooden at best.

This was all gained from the first 20 minutes of the show.  Take it or leave it from a vet that was 'over there', watch

'Gunner Palace"" if you want a truer depiction of the surrealism that is combat.",1122595200,20,1067,4.760869565217392

2325020,1,B0009VBTQ4,"While I admire FX and the producers for attempting to bring a fictional account of the Iraq War to the small screen, I found the series pilot to be horribly inaccurate. Watch it with any OIF Vet and I'm sure they'll view it as the cartoon that it is.

Granted, it's entertainment (which is questionable at best), but rather than presenting characters who well represent today's Army, they instead chose to fall back onto comfortable stereotypes. All that's missing is the ""cocky guy from Brooklyn"" and the ""the backcountry sharpshooter from Kentucky"".

Simply, the character's are wooden and trivialize reality.

The worst thing about the show is that in trying to be realistic and entertaining, it instead succeeds in myth-making. God help us if millions of Americans take this as ""the way it is"".

Viewers who are interested in the war would be better served by renting of buying the surreal ""Gunner Palace"" or the straight ""In the Company of Soldiers"".

2325021,3,B0009VBTQ4,"This episode entails a standoff between a squad of the 3ID and a group of terrorists holed up in a mosque. Naturally, no one can forcibly move in because there's an Al-Jazeera reporter inside as well, and of course, being cautious to bad press just as there was in the Abu Gharib scandal, they stay outside waiting for the political climate to wear down before making their move. During this time, with sporadic gunfights, there is, somewhat, a development of each character. There's the NCO who's angry that he's forced to remain in Iraq for an additional 90 days to head up a ""newbie"" squad, Bo who's a natural leader, Dim who earned his nickname for being a Cornell student who dropped it all and ended up signing for the army (a move his comrades felt was stupid, hence his name), Angel who sings like one, another fellow who had a name I couldn't remember, Double-wide a female PvT, and Mrs. B who for most of the show isn't much of a character. The dialogue and action scenes are well worth watching in terms of entertainment, albeit it's pretty much as Hollywood as you can get.

Still, in the cliched-ness of it all, there echoes, some truth. The injuries that I won't specifically spoil, the anger of the prisoners who are captured near the end, the frustration at having your tour delayed so you can't go back home, and the cheating spouse situation. So for all this, why only three stars? Well at the end of the show I was satisfied enough, but there is a lot of room for improvement. I won't complain too much about the lack of realism, as it's supposed to serve as entertainment, so I'll deal with my disappointments regarding the show in that aspect. My beef is with the squad's behaviour. They were very unprofessional and a CO's job is to take care of his men/women, not to constantly yell at them. This isn't boot camp anymore, these people are trained for their jobs. To make them look as if they didn't know that they were doing (when realistically, members of the 3ID spent a month in Kuwait before entering this stage portrayed in the episode) was an insult. Most people don't say Sir post training as for the most part, people just say Sarge or something. Mrs. B played the damsel in distress who got easily defensive when a man tried to help her out even though she needed it. It was just sad to watch her play the typecast of a feminine soldier.

And the flagged mines should've caught their attention as for the most part, they would usually have someone looking out for that kind of thing. Sure, it adds to the story, so I'll forgive that, as accidents happen, but I just expected more from the pilot seeing as there was so much hype. Don't get me wrong, it's a show worth watching, but those who tend to scrutinze every detail, it might piss you off.

Still a worthy effort as it has in fact, humbled me more when I think of friends and loved ones I have serving. Good show for what it is, I hope it only gets better.",1122508800,7,2944,4.438077634011091

2325023,4,B0009VBTQ4,"It wasn't long ago that I remember this one saying from a soldier of a Medal of Honor game.  He said something like, ""We don't believe in wars, but we believe in what we're fighting for in wars.""  I may not have used the quote right, but I understand what he was saying, and I think most of the soldiers out there are thinking the same.

- PILOT REVIEW

While ""Over There"" may not be the first tv series to revolve around the Iraqi warfare, this could be the best one I have seen yet.  In order to avoid the confusion (like there is), I'm reviewing the PILOT of the series, so all the flaws and changes that occur in the later episodes are for the moment unjustified; just look at the ""PILOT REVIEW"" cover title, for crying out loud!  The story and characters may be fictitous in ""Over There"", but the situation couldn't damn be any more real.

When I was watching this first episode at FX, I wasn't clear if this show took place in the Gulf War or the recent war my fellow country is at the pits over.  ""Over There"" takes place in the latter, an inconclusive barrage in a realistic ""Risk"" game filled with bloodshed and social satire, where the characters of the show arrived right in the middle of a country vs. country dogfight.  This is their lives, and this is their story.

Their real names were rarely spoken, so they go by their aliases: The Sergeant, Bo, Angel, Smoke, Doublepuff, Mrs. B and the other names my limited mind couldn't remember.  The Sergeant is a coerceful loudmouth who makes his soldiers follow orders, and he doesn't mind to take out his own soldier if one interferes.  Bo knows fighting, Bo knows fear, Bo knows pain, and Bo knows he might be the main character of the show.  Angel is a regular black choirboy that is stingy over racial tendecies.  Doublepuff (I think that's her name) fights for the sake of her own family, and the four-eyes whose name I couldn't remember fights for the family that doesn't want him (and I'm sure he's one of the guys that regrets being a soldier of war).  No matter what kind of personality and purpose the characters portrays, all these soldiers have something in common:  they all have a lot to lose in battle.

This ain't your daddy's ""Hogan's Heroes"", this is a hardcore war show.  The TV-MA rating of ""Over There"" suggests that you're gonna have the intense violence, the sexual content, and the pure obscenity (albeit, more frequent than either violence or sex combined).  That's a good thing, cause this shows it has the grittyness to make a strong, realistic warfare.  When I was watching these soldiers hiding in the ground to avoid fire from the Iraqi soldiers, waiting for orders to pounce these terrorists scum, or experiencing a landmind during vehicular transportation, that was some crazy stuff going on.  I admit, the hiding scenes and certain conversations were testing my patience, but hey, patience reaps the rewards.

Ultimately (at least, for the pilot), ""Over There"" looks to be as intense as war shows can make of it.  Some of the characters are likeable, the camera-work is inspired by ""Saving Private Ryan"", and like all war in media, the action is morbidly satisfying.  From the looks of the preview, there's gonna be more characters involved, plot-twists, and carnage to brought out more than what I see from the pilot in upcoming episodes.  As for this DVD, it's a cheap purchase, but I suggest you wait when the Season set to come out next year, with possible commentaries and more making-of featurettes, along with all to episodes to the series; presuming all the episodes are as solid as the pilot.  If there's one good thing to summarizes the series from the pilot: it has potential.

Yes, the show has so-called portrayed 3ID during OIF III; however, 3ID was NOT like that. We don't establish ridiculous nicknames for Soldiers, as well has having a Sergeant that actually will get away with disrespecting their peers as well as doing nothing but demeaning his subordinates. In the 3ID of all divisions, they would not tolerate it; we're currently deployed now, and I was with 3ID also during OIF III. This was a disgrace. The only true fact of this show, that actually shows the reality of it, is the Soldier's wife that had cheated on him the minute he left; unfortunately that does happen. But everything else? Come on. This show was absolutely ludicrus. I'm glad it was cancelled, hopefully because our CG at the time was highly offended by it. 3ID is NOT a young division; the official reviewer of this show should have done their history.

2325060,5,B0009VBTQ4,"When the hype machine began running for ""Over There"" in the Fall of 2005, I feared the worst: a knee jerk, jingoistic portrayal of Iraq II.  So you can imagine my surprise when I watched the first episode-- still a skeptic-- and found myself geting involved with the characters, each an individual, each flawed, each heroic at times, each in service for his/her own reason, serving for reasons that weren't always noble or clear, but serving and becoming part of a disparate, dysfuntional family, in a world of kill or be killed, where the only certainty was uncertainty.

  We were hooked after the first episode, and came back week in, week out, to watch with empathy and horror as the season unfolded, following each of the members of this unit-- and their families back home.  It is a strange war, with satellite phones and internet video mail making it possible to stay connected-- somewhat-- while fighting heat, boredom, terrorist, land mines, etc.
  It was gripping, real, filled with ambiguity, terror, heroism, self-doubt, hard choices, and no clear cut sense why we are there, what the Big Mission is, and worst,  who the enemy really is.

  In a just world, ""Over There"" would be back for another season.  It will remain one of the most memorable depictions of modern war-- at the boots on the ground level-- you will see.  It shows that there are casualties amongst the locals, their families, and children, and the families left back home to worry about their soldiers Over There.  War is hell.  Really.  But it is not black and white.

  We love ""Over There,"" despite all my initial skepticism and doubt.  See it.  If you are not hooked after two episodes, it isn't for you.  But if you are, you will stay with it to the end, and want it-- but not the war-- to go on.",1148515200,9,1782,4.626198083067092

Sorry, nice try, but this creation is a simple and manipulative view of a very complex war.  Its as if the war is a side story to ""Desperate Housewives"".

2325063,1,B0009VBTQ4,"I wish I could give it minus stars. This is a copy of a letter I wrote to Bochco in July of 2005 after watching the premiere episode:

""Dear Mr. Bochco;

I just watched the premiere episode of your new series ""Over There"" on the FX network and wanted to share with you my thoughts on the program. This is the first time in my life I've been motivated to send a letter to the producer of a show - that's how strongly I feel about what I just saw.

First, some background. I'm 56 years old and I was raised in a foreign service family. I enlisted in the Army in 1969 and served in Vietnam from summer of 1969 to summer of 1970. I'm a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I make it a point to stay current on military affairs. My daughter is 19 years old, and over the last couple of years has had several of her friends enlist in the Army and Marines. Some have served in Iraq; a couple have died in the service, at least one of them during combat operations in Iraq. They're all very proud of their service, and justifiably so. I mention these things so that you know I'm speaking with a very intimate knowledge of military life.

That having been said, I thought what I saw tonight was simply ludicrous, and I'm going to tell you why.

Let's start with the political tenor of the show. The Vietnam War ended 30 years ago; you may have noticed. It was in all the papers. And yet what we got tonight was a rehash of the same old, trite anti-war tripe that was so popular in the 70's. Part of that was the caricatural characterizations of the troops that was also so popular back in the bad old days: the bellicose and disaffected sergeant who somehow gets away with yelling at his superiors when he's not yelling at or threatening his subordinates; the incompetent junior officer; the over-educated enlisted man (I mean come on - a Cornell man is a private?); the over-indulgent senior officer/father figure who insults the lieutenant in front of the troops; the nave high school football quarterback; etcetera, etcetera. A poor man's version of Stone's ""Platoon"".

Then there are the tactical issues. You've got a sergeant leading a six man fire team; that's the job of a corporal. A sergeant would be leading a full squad. As far as I could see, those six people were the only US troops opposing whatever force was in the mosque. A bit undermanned, wouldn't you say? And in their position behind the berm, they're in line about three yards apart. One mortar round or grenade could wipe out the whole group. For a sergeant who keeps yelling about how he's going to keep his troops alive, ""Screamer"" was certainly doing a very poor job of it. And that's another thing, why are all those soldiers having very loud conversations while they're supposedly holding a night position? I almost busted a gut laughing at that one.

I could go on, but I think you get the point. Basically, in trying to revisit the anti-war hyperbole of the Vietnam War era, you've grossly misrepresented the soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen who are serving our country so nobly in the Middle East. You are doing them a huge disservice, and frankly I think your characterizations are insulting to them. It would be even more insulting if the show wasn't so silly on so many levels.

On a personal note, I hope FX yanks this show off the air. In aid of that possibility, I'm forwarding to them, via email, a copy of this letter.""

Bochco did have the good grace to write back and ask me to try a few more episodes and give the show a chance, which I did, including trying to watch another episode on FX last night. I've seen nothing to change the opinions I stated in my first letter to him.

In my opinion, this show stinks, and does a grave disservice to our military. Don't buy the DVDs, don't watch the show, write FX a letter of complaint and demand they yank this turkey off the air.",1137888000,32,3872,4.417952314165498

2325065,1,B0009VBTQ4,"Over there is not realistic. Not the fights, not the way the US soldiers are deployed (women are put into front line combat. Can you say I DONT THINK SO???), not the way the US soldiers fight (they never call in airstrikes, reinforcements, or use realistic tactics). The whole thing seems to be a made-up fantasy. Whoever is doing the fantisization knows very little about how our military operates.

It does not show a single positive thing about the Iraq war. No soldiers are handing out toys or candy to Iraqi children. There are no scenes in which the US forces are seen as heroic or compassionate. Never is there a happy face among either the US forces or the Iraqis who have been liberated from the brutal dictator known as Saddam. Over There would never depict, for example, the REAL drama where the statue of Saddam was pulled down to a deleriously happy crowd of Iraqis who beat it with their shoes as the head was dragged through the crowd.

Every US soldier seems to be either doomed to have a cheating wife or girlfriend, die or lose a limb. In fact, only a tiny fraction of US soldiers face any of these problems. Over There seems to ignore the fact that this is one of the lowest casualty wars ever fought by the US. Instead, they would rather embolden the enemy by giving them hope. If you watch Over There, you are helping them towards that end.",1132704000,11,1361,4.461847389558233

Now I am not so sure about a lot of the aspects of war as I was before.  Gripping drama, hopefully it will hold up for season 2.",1132099200,8,417,3.802325581395349
2325067,3,B0009VBTQ4,"This is sort of a weird series in terms of what works and what doesn't.  For this review I'm going to bullet-point some things.

What Works:

1.  Erik Palladino- The ER alum deserves special recognition.  He's STEALING the series.  He's really that good here.

2.  The production value is terrific.  I don't know where they're filming at, but they did an outstanding job designing the sets and props.  EVERYTHING looks totally authentic.

3.  The story-lines in Iraq do a great job of holding my interest.  Granted, I have absolutely no idea how ""real"" any of it is or how much is ""Hollywood"", but they've never lost my attention and I've never been inclined to fast-forward anything.

4.  The interplay between and characters in the unit seems completely natural and flows wonderfully.  I totally believe it as I'm watching the fire-team get to know one another and develop relationships with each other.

What Doesn't:

1.  Almost everything on the home front.  With the lone exception of Dumphy's alcoholic wife, I just can't seem to generate even the smallest amount of interest in ANYTHING going on at home.

2.  The role of the First Lieutenant.  First it was ""Mad Cow"" then ""Underpants""; the role of the ""Idiot First Lieutenant"" is becoming the ""red-shirt ensign"" of the series.  The production team would be doing themselves a favor by filling the role for more then a four or five episode story arc.

3.  The closing 'Over There' anthem.  Simply put, I hate that song.  I also can't stand that I'm forced to listen to it because it's running over the last five minutes of the episode.  Unfortunately for me though, Chris Gerolmo wrote and performs it.  It's something he's clearly proud of and he's not going to cut his own song out.  I'll just have to learn to deal with it.

A lot of the problems I feel like the series has, I chalk up to this being a first year show still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't.  It simply needs a little more time to find it's way a bit and gain some polish.  There's definitly more good here then bad and I'm looking forward to a big Season Two.

Sure, all that wouldn't happen to one detachment, but I don't want to be that bored.

2325070,4,B0009VBTQ4,"The pilot episode was a bit exaggerated. The writers had to introduce all the characters and fill in their backgrounds, as well as put them into the conflict and find a way to keep us interested in tuning in for the second episode.

So I waited until episode 11 to comment on the series.

And what a series it is! Of course it's not completely realistic. If it were totally realistic, we'd be watching hours and hours of kids sitting around trying to take naps in sandstorms. That would not make for a good show.

Instead, our characters are sent on a different assignment every week. Each mission is a composite of different real-life situations, and is manufactured to give us an idea of what is going on in the lives of our soldiers. I suppose it could be more realistic if each mission portrayed was with a different group of soldiers, but you can't build characters and create a bond with the audience if you keep introducing new people.

Over There finds its groove after the third episode, and keeps getting better. If you accept it for what it is--a dramatization and composite portrait of army life--you will be entertained and touched. It certainly provides a lot of vicarious passion when life's mundane traffic jams and paperwork leave you feeling flat.

I am unsure why the right-wingers here are screaming that this show is leftist propaganda, because I am almost as left as you can go (vegan, anti-war) yet I still feel the pull to sign up and bleed a little for the soldiers we've sent into the fury. It's hard to watch this show and not feel a connection and empathy for our soldiers. But I suppose if the rightys are insecure about their cause, they will continue to scream about liberal Hollywood.

All I will say is that I can't believe that someone would think that NO ONE in the middle east has a problem with Americans, only with our goverment. So, Mr. Iran, please take out your frustrations on the people that send us ""over there"", not the troops who are ordered to do a job. Most of us come over here, want to do our job, stay alive, and go home to our families.  Please take your ""views"" to other mediums.  The last thing I will say is that if you buy this to experience a ""realistic to the T deployment,"" don't, enlisting might be a better option.",1128297600,2,869,4.503184713375796
2325073,1,B0009VBTQ4,"When this show first came out, I gave it the benefit of the doubt.  Surely this wouldn't be just another lame Hollywood anti-war / anti-military TV show?  I was wrong.

I'll grant that nothing they show is, by itself, unrealistic.  A wife who cheats on her husband while he's overseas is not unheard of.  The media making the military look bad, sure, that happens (not only inside of the show but in the very creation of the show itself!)  Having an LT that takes orders literally, to the point of defying common sense?  It can happen.

But all of these things do not happen to the same people over a 3 week period.  The show is becoming ridiculous.

What are the producers trying to accomplish?  It seems the moral of the story is ""Do not stand up and fight for what you believe in or what you think is right, because if you do, your wife will cheat on you, the media will make you look bad, you'll lose a limb in combat, get addicted to morphine and maybe die"".  Wow, what a great moral.  It's like Dr. Suess.

When I was in the military, most of the guys were single and those who weren't had (as far as I could tell!) happy homes.  The commanding officers were by and large competent and fair and the doctors always seemed to put common courtesy ahead of strict protocol.

This show is designed to do one thing: convince people to not join the military by presenting an exaggerated picture of it to the point of being a lie.  There's plenty of interesting things you could do in a show about war without putting every single negative aspect front and center without regard for the actual rarity of it.  This show has a chance to educate the people about life in the military but highlighting every single worst aspect of it in a totally disproportionate manner is wrong.",1126051200,7,1774,4.406153846153846
2325074,5,B0009VBTQ4,"The Battle Begins, Over There's first episode is a good start to a promising series. I'm not sure about the accuracy, because I've never served in the military. One thing I find funny is that half the reviewers have bashed Over There for being innacurate and being too ""Hollywood"", but the two actual soldiers who have reviewed have praised this show for being an accurate depiction of what is going on in the Middle East. I think I'm going to trust the words of reviewers who have actually been ""Over There"" when it comes to issue of accuracy.

Anyway, this series is great. I watched the first episode and could not wait for the second episode to air. For those who have not started watching this series, I'm not going to spoil the ending of the first episode, but I will tell you that it will catch you off guard and will make you want to watch the rest of the series.

Over There is probably the best TV series out right now, so catch the new episodes every Wednesday night at 10 on FOX!",1125705600,8,991,4.351351351351352

2325078,5,B0009VBTQ4,"I have seen this episode of Over There and I was instantly hooked on the show.  I make it a point now to not miss any episodes.  I have read some of the reviews here about what people think of the show.  Having actually served in Iraq I can relate to everything that has happened on the show.  I am not at all surprised that Gulf War Vets and civilians who commonly know nothing at all about being a soldier would turn there noses up at this show.  The style of combat we are waging now is the occupation of a hostile nation.  We haven't had to forcefully occupy an enemy nation since World War II.  Our military is a little out of practice on the matter.  Keep in mind also the 'Politician' were to impatient for the invasion, and a clear plan for occupation was nowhere near finished.

As for the violence, surprise, there is an abundance of that in a combat zone.  Maybe that last reviewer on here thinks we use paint rounds or something.  Yes there is a lot of violence on T.V.  Perhaps there should be less of it.  But when making a show dealing with a combat zone, what else are you going to show.

When watching this show you should do one very important thing, that is ignore whatever political thoughts you have and just observe what is happening in the show.  After all it was politics that sent me and thousands of my fellow soldiers to Iraq.  In the show you will see that the last thing on the soldiers minds is crap like politics.  Unless the only soldier you can relate to is the guy they call Smoke who thinks everyone is out to get him because he is black.  He is often surprised when people don't see things his way and that is because he is an idiot.  You see a lot of them in the military, mostly officers though.  That guy Smoke cares only for himself and if he keeps his current attitude up in the show he will get one of his guys killed, if not all of them.

You see in this show the basic problems soldiers have to deal with while Over There.  Main concern being survival of course.  Soldiers having to deal with leaving loved ones back home fighting a campaign few of us understand or even want to be apart of.  Soldiers deal with being seriously wounded, as in one soldiers case he deals with the loss of his leg in the last episode.  Muslim troops having to deal with the natural prejudice soldiers show towards anyone they beleave to be an enemy.  A sergeant in 101st Airborne who was a muslim murdered fellow soldier by throwing grenades in there tent.  He was just recently put on death row.  You try not being that when you don't even know if you can trust someone who is supposed to be on your side because they are a muslim.  The show also shows a wife back in the states cheating on her husband who is in combat, because for some reason she can't come to terms with the fact that the fighting has nothing to do with her.  You think I'm kidding.  When my unit came back from Iraq half of my companies troops were either getting a divorce or heading for one.  Or how about the stress of road block duty, IED's (improvised explosive devices, for you civilians).  Or how about the constant propaganda slams against us by Al Jazeera news teams.  Keep in mind the Al Jazeera new network aired the beheading of Nicholas Berg on all their news channels in the Middle East.  Yeah we saw it there.

All this and people back here are always wining about how the Iraqi civilians feel, and why don't the soldiers be nice to them.  That disgusting word 'Politics' is why.  I personally did not want to go to Iraq.  I would have rather fought in Afghanistan where I think our attentions should be focused.  We never found any weapons of mass destruction like Bush or Rumsfeld said there was.  Over 1000 troops dead then they admit that the intel was bad.  Then we have to install a democratic nation with people who have been fighting each other for over a thousand years, and just cause we are there our politicians think it should just stop.  When those old learned people fail to do there jobs on the hill, it is the young men and women in the soldiers uniforms who do the dying.  Then the politicians have the guts to give small raises to the troops that means nothing to them because taxes take it away, and the politicians make almost a million dollars a year.  Far more than someone who has sworn to die for there country and like many of my fellow soldiers has seen enough carnage and horror to cost many a nights sleep.

Bottom line.  You want a safe glimpse of what it is like in hell from the safety of your living room, where you will never have to bleed for the freedoms you all take for granted, purchase this episode or just watch it on FX.  But remember, if you don't know what you are talking about when it comes to war, don't say anything or make sure you at least have done your research.",1123632000,21,4826,4.280662983425414
2325079,5,B0009VBTQ4,"After seeing the first two episodes of ""Over There"" and being emotionally torn apart by both, I was struck by what is so important and moving about this show:  Over There has started a national dialogue about the war in Iraq that is not centered around politics.  It's about the human aspects of war; the day-to-day stories of the soldiers.  For non-military people (like me), it has given a peak, whether or not completely accurate, into the horrors of war - up close and personal.  Watch this show and think about the real, individual men and women fighting ""over there""; not about the political arguments and justification.  It gave me a new perspective on the lives of our soldiers and their families, which I otherwise couldn't imagine.",1123372800,12,741,4.803149606299213
2325080,1,B0009VBTQ4,"I saw only a part of this and had to turn it off, wondering what I would learn from yet more violence.  Where were the Iraqi mothers and wives who are waiting at home for their loved ones to return?  Aren't they just as much a part of this war?  I agree with several reviewers here that this is more of the same, supposedly created not as a political statement, but as ""entertainment,"" i.e. Hollywood hokum.  But is that responsible on such a topic as this war, where actual - not storybook - people are dying?  I did not serve in Iraq, so I probably don't have the authority to speak about this like some of the writers here do.

I was reminded of the great film director William Wyler, who, when World War II began, decided to enlist for the war effort and, while on fighter planes, made a film documentary about the war.  I'm afraid that generation that used their gifts toward positive ends is gone.  Beware the film maker (or writer, or artist) who says their work is not ""political.""  You can't raise millions of dollars - which is clearly what this project costs - without politics.  If this film were truly not political, then Bochco and his supporters would donate every dime this film makes to the Iraqi people and to the support of the military in Iraq.",1123200000,5,1264,4.4094827586206895

Americans need to support our brave troops overseas instead of abusing their reputations in the name of ""entertainment"". Like the ""Stealth"" movie just released, this series provides ""action"" for us dumb middle-Americans while inserting a healthy dose of anti-americanism for the armchair liberal set. For those people, every war is a retake on Vietnam. If you enjoyed Jane Fonda's vision of Vietnam, you'll like this program. I can't wait to see the episodes where an American soldier experiences guilt over having killed civilians or we are given a sympathetic view of a terrorist.

2325084,1,B0009VBTQ4,"As another Operation Iraqi Freedom vet, and an officer with 24 years experience in uniform I was appalled.  I watched the whole thing and gave it a chance, but It was garbage, totally unbelievable with implausible situations, characters, and dialog. Who is the military consultant on this show? Michael Moore?

Bochco and Gerolmo have made US Soldiers look stupid, unprofessional and completely inept. Portraying them as regulation-breaking, pot-smoking, back-talking, and risk taking was insulting to the hard-working pros that make up the vast majority of military members, especially those serving in Iraq.  This production is not helping our soldiers at all, it makes them look bad at a time when we can ill afford to damage their credibility with the public. Their use of worn-out stereotypes of screaming sergeants, racism against black soldiers, sexism against female soldiers, and contempt of officers is outrageous and could not be further from the truth. They have simply taken characters out of old war movies and recast them in desert camouflage.

""They're getting to know each other, as they're trying to familiarize themselves with a foreign country and hostile situations.""  That doesn't happen.  We don't through rookies into the fight without any training.  Troops in Iraq have been together for a long time in the US training for many months before going overseas.  When they arrive in theater, they train some more.  When they reach their base, they train some more.  Our soldiers know each very well way before they find themselves in a firefight.  The idea that new recruits would be dropped into a fire fight is Viet Nam era thinking.  It just isn't done today.

Our professional non commissioned officers (sergeants) do not swear at officers, or scream at their soldiers.  They do not threaten them...""I'll shoot you myself.""  And they would never make one sergeant stay behind to train ""virgins"".  (Where did they get that term?)  If anything, an entire company of three or four platoons with four squads each would be made to stay for an extra 90 days and any training they gave to new soldiers would be conducted on a base, not in the field on a mission.

It is clear they had no current or former members of the Army participating.  Their reference sources are ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", plus the headlines from newspapers.  They are not at all interested in what is really happening in Iraq, how Army units operate, what tremendous progress is being made, or how many lives have been changed for good now that the freedom loving people of Iraq are free from Saddam Hussain and his dictatorship.

I hated it and so will the rest of the military.

As the credits rolled and the 40 year old Huey climbed high into the sunset, I was hoping an insurgent missile would blow it to pieces so the characters could be saved from doing another episode.  Bochco should go back to cop shows, and Gerolmo should decide what he wants to do for a living, write television shows, or sing theme songs.
