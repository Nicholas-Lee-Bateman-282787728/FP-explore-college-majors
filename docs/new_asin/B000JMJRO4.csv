8152149,3,B000JMJRO4,"KISS followed-up their tremendously successful release: Kiss Exposed, with another VHS gem, X-Treme Close-Up. The only problem with the latter is that the footage consists of edited clips rather than full videos. A poor collection in such a cut format. This DVD offers X-Treme and a newer selection, Konfidential. Konfidential is the true value here, live performances from the Revenge Tour. All-in-all an o.k. DVD to own for KISS fanatics.",1196985600,,440,5.3
