3891485,5,B002ASAFFK,"I just happened to be in Barnes and Noble one day and I purchased the Simply Yoga DVD by Yolanda Pettinato.  Well, I became hooked!  I now have a yoga room!  I wanted to be able to tell Yolanda how excited I was about my yoga practice  and I was able to do that when I found her on Facebook.  She is a terrific lady who told me about the work she was doing and about this YogaEasy DVD.  I knew right away I wanted to purchase this DVD and add it to my collection.  I use both Simply Yoga and YogaEasy almost daily and I feel better about myself.  I am happy to take the time to practice, especially at a time when I was feeling down due to the economy and being unemployed.  The YogaEasy practice is different than Simply Yoga and that helps keep you from becoming bored. Yolanda's voice is calming and soothing and the wind chimes are a beautiful touch.  The poses are challenging, but not too difficult and the stretching really helps with flexibility issues.  Also, Yolanda is very encouraging.",1271116800,2,997,4.306451612903226
3891486,5,B002ASAFFK,"Being time poor with a busy job and young family, I purchased the `YogaEasy' DVD with Yolanda Pettinato to help me fit some yoga in on my own time.  I found the DVD very easy to follow and got benefit almost straight away.  My core strength is up, I started to sleep better and my muscle tone has also noticeably improved.  Her voice is so naturally calming and yet encouraging and uplifting.  It is now part of my daily schedule and if I am still practicing when the kids get up - they join in with me!

3891487,5,B002ASAFFK,"Yoga Easy - Absolutely Perfect.
It's very versatile, in that it' s perfect for a beginners, but is adjustable to suit those who are familiar with the practice of yoga, allowing you to push yourself that bit harder.
The DVD is kept simple, yet challenging enough, being 30 minutes in duration.  In such a short period of time Yolanda manages to incorporate a whole body workout, stretching all muscles.  Yolanda gives clear concise instructions and focuses on breathing to achieve the full benefits of the posture.  She also ensures that you do rest your body before moving on to the next pose.  Her voice is calm and soothing, transporting you to a serene environment.  Yolanda's passion for teaching yoga, her positive energy and positive words have made me more passionate about my yoga practice. My practice of yoga has improved my self esteem and helped to create calmness in my life. It has been a great tool in helping me to manage the stress and anxiety in my life.
Thanks Yolanda, you are the main reason why I enjoy yoga as much as I do. You are a true inspiration.  Keep on inspiring.",1247961600,5,1094,4.642487046632124

3891489,3,B002ASAFFK,"I am a big fan of Yolanda's as I have been using (and love!) her ""Simply Yoga"" DVD. She quickly gets right into the poses, which is done without a lot of background music, and you're able to do your workout in a nice peaceful relaxing 30 minutes. So I was excited to see her new ""YogaEasy"" DVD and couldn't wait to try it. However, I was a little disappointed when I found that it had a more rushed feeling to it, as though she is trying to fit too many poses into the 30 minutes allotted; not as peaceful and relaxing as the first DVD. Also, on her previous DVD, I appreciated when she used the pose names, however, on this DVD she doesn't do that for some reason. On the plus side, though, these are all new poses so you're NOT buying a new DVD which is a rehash of the same poses with a few new poses thrown in. But here's a nice surprise...if you own the book that accompanies ""Simply Yoga"" you'll find that these new poses show up in the book, which is great for us consumers and good thinking on Yolanda's part! All in all, the new DVD is okay, just takes a little getting used to if you're used to the old DVD's ways of doing things.",1247875200,14,1140,4.09375
3891490,5,B002ASAFFK,I lost 28 pounds with Yolanda's first DVD~Simply Yoga. It was the perfect yoga instruction for a complete novice. I did exactly what she said~just do your best. Mind you when I started with Simply Yoga about a year ago I was 56 years old ~overweight~ and out of shape. Yolanda's DVD's are doable. I practice with Yoga Easy every morning. I don't feel like I have to do it~ I want to do it! I will be forever grateful to her. I have never felt better and I have waist again~ thanks a million Yolanda!:):),1245628800,,503,4.25

3891492,5,B002ASAFFK,I practiced with this DVD today and it just made my day.  I felt great during and after the practice and Yolanda's voice really guides you through breath and movement in a unique way.  My favorites are the warm-up poses which are so perfect for preparing the body for the rest of the practice.  I felt centered and balanced all day after my great start with this DVD.  Thank you Yolanda!,1243209600,2,387,4.408450704225352

I loved SimplyYoga but this DVD is even better.  I feel great after doing it AND my body isn't sore.  Anyone could do this DVD and enjoy  Yolanda's soothing voice and unique form of yoga.  Great yoga DVD!",1243209600,,574,10.176470588235293

3891499,4,B002ASAFFK,"The ladybug and bumblebee were bought for young girls, The cranking is not so easy to do,  it requires the right force, if not applied well I am afraid the handles will break .  The lantern is very sturdy and throws a lot of light.  The poetry by Mary Oliver is good, as always. My yoga tapes are just right, more for stretching than for strength maybe, but right for me as I need the stretching more than the strengthening, being active all day already.",1357603200,,454,4.317647058823529

3891501,3,B002ASAFFK,"I bought this DVD in hopes it would be as polished as her first DVD Simply Yoga...I would say this is fine for beginners, but I feel the style is a step down. Trying to rehash some of the philosophy ends up feeling rushed and uncomfortable. The chimes in between poses are a nice touch for the senses, though. I don't think this was produced by the original publisher either...the background is eerily sterile and artificial.  I feel if she stayed with whomever produced her first DVD this production would have been nicer...I can't knock it entirely, though, because the poses are different from the first disc, and in that respect, and they do give the body a thorough workout...so if you can get past the informal aesthetics of it, you can get a good workout in and stretch to your heart's content.",1280793600,,801,4.601398601398602
3891502,5,B002ASAFFK,"I have both of Yolanda's DVDs, Simply Yoga and YogaEasy, and I absolutely love them!!!!  I alternate them, giving me variety each day.  She was my positive step, one year ago, into using Yoga for fitness.  I had always wanted to practice Yoga, but could not find a routine I enjoyed, that I could honestly do correctly.  Yolanda's DVDs were the answer!!  I started with Simply Yoga and then discovered her new DVD YogaEasy.  It advanced my workout just when I needed it.  I like that this newest routine adds some difficult moves and increases the workout just enough. For me, it has been a fitness routine that I love to do and feel I can safely take into my ""later"" years, which will continue to keep me strong and healthy!!!!  In addition, Yolanda's DVDs help this overworked teacher to de-stress, thanks to her peaceful, encouraging voice.  Yolanda is truly a gifted Yoga instructor!!",1279152000,2,888,4.714285714285714
3891503,2,B002ASAFFK,"It was like a home video, we could have done the same thing if we made it at home with a tripod.  Her previous video was much better in quality...peaceful, serene, and easy to follow.  This one...yuck!
