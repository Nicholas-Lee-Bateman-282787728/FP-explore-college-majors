He is a strong and imponent actor, and change the manner to see any movie. If you like George  C. Scott, i recommend this movie.",957484800,,255,4.204081632653061

8045502,2,B000777JHI,I really didn't like this movie that well. I didn't care for George C Scott as the bad character and Eric Roberts as the good guy. Only my opinion. My husband didn't like it either and he loves George C Scott.,1421884800,,209,4.121951219512195

8045504,5,B000777JHI,"This is the best made for cable movie that I have ever seen. I first watched it in 1990 when it debuted on HBO. The acting is extremely good, especially by the three leads (Roberts, Lane, and Academy-Award winning legend George C. Scott), but the supporting cast is also excellent. It has a fascinating plot that is undeniably a must-see for those interested in Holocaust aspects of the Second World War. The story is riveting and ends on a jaw-dropping note. Strong sexual content, some mild violence, and harsh language. R-rated for a reason, but a fine quality DVD.",1409616000,,568,4.747474747474747

8045506,2,B000777JHI,Decent story (sort-of) - I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could - Not all that well written or directed - and to see George C. Scott so obese was a downer - he should have taken better care of himself.  Good suspense - unrealistic ending.,1341100800,,234,3.978723404255319
