7986792,4,B00008RWV7,"Saw this on tv. Linda Kozlowski plays a tough private detective. Stands up to harassment, bad guys, turns out the ""hero."" Great movie. Played character role perfect. Real to life as working to make a living. If it was region 1 & a reasonable price, I would add it to my dvd collection of about 1,100. I'm so
Disappointed. --jg",1465084800,,326,4.45
7986793,5,B00008RWV7,"I absolutely love this movie, mostly because I think Linda Ksolowski is awesome in it. I can-t figure out why this movie is so darned hard to find on disc!!!!! It's a hell of a lot better than about half the crummy movies that are out there!! I don't get the way this system works. Who the hell decides what movies are put on disc, or for only a short run and what are not? I am a movie nut. I have over 2000 DVD s in my collection so far and I'm still trying to get more than a VHS transfer in my collection of this fine and fun movie, but so far I've ordered this from Amazon 3 times and yet have not received one yet. GO LINDA KOSLOWSKI!!",1291075200,6,641,3.900763358778626
