6678028,5,B00NSZJXS4,"This documentary is superb! Like other Gunn documentaries we've seen, it is well-paced and holds your attention throughout. The interviews are well done and informative. The ""diner"" motif throughout the film adds a fun and educational element. We were especially delighted by the metaphors exemplified by the characters in the diner.

What especially gets my whole-hearted review is the message. While the movie does a lot of pointing out the errors in our system, the highlight is the clear message of returning to personal/family responsibility for our health care!

Every person in America needs to see this movie. People need to look through the political babble to understand that a ""single payer system"" means ""a government monopoly on health care"". If you're familiar with basic economics or you've ever played the game Monopoly, you realize that the consumer ALWAYS loses when t
here's a Monopoly (like owning all of the Railroads in the game). And as Colin points out in the movie, governments have always been notoriously bad at running businesses.

The reason health care is expensive in America is NOT a mystery nor is it confusing. Watching this movie will help bring some clarity.",1418860800,11,1194,5.112820512820512

6678031,5,B00NSZJXS4,"Ever been told ""everything's covered"" - only to experience sticker shock after the claim is processed?

Have you experienced the frustration of trying to determine the cost for a medical procedure up front?

Why is healthcare so expensive?  Has it always been like this?

In ""Wait Till It's Free"" Colin Gunn explores the bureaucratic labyrinth that healthcare has become, exposing the incentives that exist for both healthcare providers and insurance companies to inflate costs.  He reveals the largely forgotten history of healthcare and shows how increasing 3rd party involvement (whether the government or insurance companies) has always lowered the quality of care and increased costs.

If you are at all concerned about the healthcare crisis in this country, this documentary is an invaluable resource pointing to a variety of creative, practical, and somewhat surprising modern solutions.",1411776000,20,894,5.536764705882353
8679921,5,B00NSZJXS4,"Long story short, went to the er out of pain and fear that my appendix may burst and cause death. Quick money saving lessons learned at my BIG expense. Lesson 1. Don't look up your symptoms on the internet and don't trust Web Md or any internet medical advice because at best they err on the side of caution thanks to lawyers and at worst they direct people to the hospital money machine.  Internet medical site made me think I was having an appendix problem and also said not to take a antacid which can make it worse.  Lesson 2. Have strong prescription pain medication available to manage late night weekend pain to allow non hospital doctor visit.  Having a loved one crying in pain and waiting hours or days till regular doctor office is open will be tough for a person to do, so its the ER or wait.  Lesson 3.  Try over the counter heartburn medication to see if it stops the pain your having because you don't want to go to a regular doctor clinic only for them to tell you to take over the counter pain medication which you could've done before spending the money and time going to the doctor.  I didn't have any heart burn burning sensation at all, instead my stomach felt like I was punched in the gut, sometimes the pain would radiate to my kidneys and lower back.  In fact from my research there have been people who went to the ER thinking they were having a heart attack only to be told it was heartburn.  So I'm taking an heartburn medication for any internal pain in by abdominal area.  So I go with no health insurance to the hospital er, yea I knew it would be more expensive than a regular doctor visit but as I said I was in pain and was thinking my appendix was going to burst and die thanks to Web Md.  Before any test were donte my nurse practitoner told me that it was not my appendex because of the location of my pain so I was thankful for that.  So I have blood work done, IV bag given to me, Sonogram, and CT scan with contrast.  At the time I even questioned if the CT scan was necessary because they mentioned all the x rays it does and radioactive contrast they wanted to use.  But my questions were never answered and ignored by hospital staff and the test was done anyway.  After all the test were done,  Nurse practitioner told me to take over the counter heart burn medication.  The bill for all this? Nurse practitioner fee alone was 2 grand, blood work was 2 grand, Ct scan was 9 grand, IV bag 500 dollars.  It was over 14 grand to be told to take over the counter heartburn medication.  The expensive tests requested by the nurse practitioner didn't indicate to try heartburn medication, that was something she knew to try from experience from treating people who suffered the same way I was suffering so why did she request all these expensive and harmful x ray test?  Follow the money.
 Why so much? Because uninsured people get hit twice.  They are punished with uninsured health penalty tax and with the full price of the Hospital Charge Master list.  The Charge Master prices are often 10x or more the cost the hospital pays.  Excellent time magazine article available on kindle for 99 cent call Bitter Pill talks about all this.  There is also a excellent video called Wait Till Its Free.  So in truth Medicare aka the government gets the best discount off the hospitals highly over infalted Charge Master prices and pay 35 percent but Joe public thinks the government is being billed the charge master prices.  Your Gold health insurance you pay dearly for gets you a 40 percent discount on the charge master prices but again Joe public sees the  charge master prices and think the insurance is paying the rest.  Its a win win win scam situation for the Hospitals, health insurance companies and the government because even at the government paying  35 percent of the charge master price the hospitals are still making money profits, Hospitals are making even more profit money with insurance discount so all the health insurance companies are doing is giving Joe public a discount on the over priced hospital prices and hosptials really making money off the poor uninsured by charging them the full charge master prices.  Sure I got a offer of 20 percent discount for paying in full and being uninsured.  What a joke.  But here is where uncle same wins too....the highly over inflated charge master prices gets write off by the hospital and then uncle SAM can come after you for taxes for the unpaid hospital bill.  Also hospitals can get judgment to put liens on your property and garnish you checks.  So seeing how this is huge money, I now know why none of the Over the counter medication books, home doctor books, dealing with hospital books, dealing with medical billing books have been helpful in my situation or to avoid the situation.  Who wants to help Joe public when everyone else is getting rich off of him.  So in truth, everything you worked for your whole life is at risk of being ripped away from a hospital visit you need to stop the pain or under threat of death.
 This book MEDICAL BILL SURVIVAL WORKBOOK did help me find some billing errors and  that would've saved me alot of  money but both the hospital and ER doctor refused to make the correction or admit to any errors.  In particular it was level billing errors.  The doctor charged at a Level 5 and the hospital charged at a Level 4.  Right off the bat the hospital bill dispute response letter I received it said that its review of the bill DOES NOT ADDRESS MEDICAL NECESSITY OR THE REASONABLENESS OF ANY CHARGE.  But only looks at the medical records and compares it to what was done to the sucker aka patient. The hospital contracts with doctors to work the ER so even in a in network health insurance covered ER visit you can still be hit with a big doctor bill...my nurse practitioner was 2 grand for less than 30 minute face to face time. Hospital claimed Level 4 bill was correct because the doctor ordered a CT scan which to my understanding now days are given to patients like candy because its a big money maker for hospitals.  Do hospital workers know how much their unnecessary services hurt patients financially becuase I don't think they would be able to sleep at night?
In short with the guidance of the medical bill dispute book...your hope is to find incorrect amount billing for what was charged versus for what was done or given to you and that takes inside knowledge to know and to catch these types of billing errors.  For example you may be billed for a spark gap conductors procedure and see another charge for short burst dc conduits procedure on the same hospital bill.  You would have to know the medical terminology of what they are talking about and what materials are used and what is typically done in such procedures to be able to know or dispute the charge.  In this example case a mechanic or someone with experience with car repairs would know that its standard procedure to replace spark plug wires with the spark plugs and thus should not be two totally separate more expensive charges instead of one all inclusive charge.
 Then Joe public has no influence once he does find a dispute error.  Uninsured Joe public are completely powerless.  The best that health insured Joe public can hope for is to instigate a fight between the 800 pound hospital gorilla with the 800 pound health insurance gorilla by pointing out the fact that the hospital gorilla took one to many bananas from the insurance gorilla in excessive fees and charges and thus it helps insured Joe public by lowering his total medical bill in which he has to pay out of pocket.

 It would be a huge help to find a book or article of the 10 most commonly prescribed Over the counter medications prescribed for emergency room visits.  That way a person would know what to try before even stepping foot in a hospital ER. But I could not find such a thing and if anyone does please list the google search words used find it and specific names in the article so others to find it too. Here is a list of other useless books that I spent money on.  Hoping to find something that would've been helpful to me to avoid the situation i was in or at least tell me to take heartburn medication for adobmenal pain..

8679924,5,B00NSZJXS4,"Obamacare is a disaster.  Ditto for all socialistic medicine schemes.  The free market has a far better solution.  This video takes apart the foolishness of thinking the federal government can help to achieve an efficient and compassionate medical system.  Bureaucracy is not the roadway to efficiency or compassion.  Government intervention in medicine has helped to skyrocket costs and greatly enhanced inefficiency.  As with all things, there is no such thing as a free lunch.  Somebody has to pay.  Socialism is an abysmal failure wherever it has been tried because it denies the basic nature of man.  Utopians can dream of finding their perfect world with a free lunch for all which is nothing more than a pipe dream because utopia is precisely what it means, ""no place.""  While I did not like this movie as well as I did his exposure of public education, this movie holds one's interest in what would otherwise be a quite boring topic.  He also recommends my favorite and personal solution to affordable health care, Samaritan Ministries (or other similar Christian sharing ministries).  In other words, my answer has come in opting out of the traditional and very expensive insurance model.  Though this is not something that can help everyone, for Christians it can be a wonderful and truly affordable alternative.",1448668800,2,1322,5.064814814814815

8679927,5,B00NSZJXS4,"Outstanding! This is the best healthcare documentary I've ever seen. It was fantastic, and Michael Moore's documentaries (including ""Sicko"") are just communist propaganda. You must see this movie if you are at all interested in the healthcare debate in this country. This should be your starting point, and there are certainly plenty of liberal leaning documentaries (i.e. ""Sicko"") out there, so make this your chance to actually see different points of view, i.e. the capitalist one. If we had truly capitalist healthcare, the quality would go up, and the price would come down to the point that poor people could afford it. This movie illuminates how left leaning government intervention drives the price up, and the quality down.

By my observation, the free market has driven the quality up and the price down on cars, refrigerators, washing machines, ovens, and everything else since the year 1920, why would it not do the same for healthcare? In 1920, poor people couldn't afford any of those things. The only things that are truly unaffordable to poor people are higher education and healthcare: the two things that the government is the most involved in. That's my take on it.

Watch this movie!",1426032000,2,1203,5.040201005025126
8679928,5,B00NSZJXS4,"This is a shocking and true message that needs to be taken seriously. My eyes were opened as a believer in Christ to examine this area in my life and surrender it to His Lordship with joy and all diligence. This call is not going to be easy because it goes against what our flesh wants to do, but it's true and your conscience will affirm it if yielded to scripture honestly and openly. We need to repent of how we've allowed this to end up.

This is an amazing call for the body of Christ to redeem something that has been put off to the wayside as not important and thus the fruit of our silence and slothfulness has reared a rottenness  of which we will pay for with discipline from our Lord for bad stewardship of not only our bodies but ability to love and care for others more than ourselves.

This movie is given through the Christian perspective; however, it does not attempt to beat you down with theological principles. It sticks with the basic principles that Christ taught of loving others as you love yourself. They show how our current health is in turmoil and the necessity of an immediate change. It espouses the viewer to take personal responsibility of their health and look out for their fellow man.",1419292800,2,475,4.8765432098765435

The director helps explain the current crisis through real-life interviews in the US and abroad, and explains in lay terms where we are at, where we are going at present, and how bad it can truly get if we don't support positive change.
  It is partly a depressing reality, yet also hopeful, as it suggests alternatives that in fact are active in select areas of the US.
  There are entertaining ""sketches"" interspersed throughout the film to help hold interest.
  NOT your run-of-the mill dry documentary.
