4402829,4,B004LQPP4K,"Hilarious film about a high school teacher who only determines his true sexual orientation after the rest of the world gives him some clues.  The film starts innocently enough, until one of Mr. Bracket's ex-students outs him on national television.  Then the fireworks begin.  Some great moments here, plenty of incredibly funny scenes.  Interesting that this movie seems to draw mixed reactions from some folks because it's really just light playful entertainment. The graduation ceremony at the end seems to drag on a bit, but it serves the purpose of validating Mr. Bracket's new lifestyle from those in the community who genuinely care about him. Wonder why this was out-of-print for so long?",1380240000,7,696,5.132743362831858
4402830,4,B004LQPP4K,"Director Frank Oz's IN & OUT (1997) is a charming little film with a few good laughs. In a story inspired by Tom Hanks' Oscar acceptance speech for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PHILADELPHIA/dp/0800141806/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PHILADELPHIA</a>&nbsp;(1993), Kevin Kline plays Howard Brackett, a prissy-mannered, Streisand-loving high school English teacher. His class doesn't care about Shakespeare sonnets; they only wants to hear stories from Howard about former student Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), now a young star in Hollywood who's up for an Oscar.

On awards night, Cameron wins a Best Actor Oscar for playing a gay soldier. The last person he thanks is his old English teacher, Mr. Brackett, who Cameron claims is gay! This revelation from the actor shocks everyone in town, especially Brackett, who's shortly due to marry fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), She's waited three years for this and now Emily isn't sure Howard is straight. He insists he is.

One comedic highlight has Howard listening to a cassette tape that extols the listener to explore his masculinity. It's like the guy on the tape can see every little fey thing Howard does. When a Diana Ross cover of ""I Will Survive"" starts to play, Howard, with the encouragement of the taped voice, tries to resist dancing but fails. This is when he finally admits to himself that he'll never be a manly man.

Tom Selleck (sans mustache) is Peter Malloy, reporter for a TV show similar to Entertainment Tonight. Peter's in town covering the big story of the outed schoolteacher, and he stays long after other newsfolk have moved on. Eventually Malloy admits to Brackett that he's gay and that he came out to all his friends and family. Then, right on a street intersection, Peter plants a big kiss on Howard.

Meanwhile, In Hollywood Cameron Drake sees the TV reports about the damage he's caused his ex-teacher, so he heads out to his old home town to try to fix things.

At the wedding, when the minister asks Howard if he'll take Emily in Holy Matrimony, instead of answering ""I do,"" he says: ""I'm gay."" The day is ruined, everyone in church appalled, Emily embarrassed and heartbroken. Now she's thinking of regaining the 75 lbs. she lost for Howard's sake. Howard gets fired and his life seems over.

Cameron almost hits with his car a very drunk Emily, who's staggering around at night after some hard drinking in a local bar. Cameron consoles her and you can see that they've instantly become more than teacher and former student.

The film's dramatic climax occurs at high school graduation ceremonies. The school's principal (Bob Newhart) is confronted by Cameron for having firing Howard. One by one, students stand up and declare that they're gay. So do Howard's dad (Wilford Brimley) and mom {Debbie Reynolds) and practically everyone in town. It's a triumph for tolerance and acceptance.

Despite the way I've synopsized this, the movie is really entertaining and worth seeing. It gave me the ""sillies"" more than once.",1378598400,,3065,5.165322580645161

4402878,1,B004LQPP4K,"There's nothing wrong with being gay. But this movie shamefully plays on the worn-out stereotype that if a guy likes fashion or musicals or some other activity that's the antithesis of being Mr. Macho, then he must be gay.

Most of these myths seem to be spread by guys obsessed with their machoism. They're quick to ridicule any guy who's not a regular beer drinker and always bragging about his sex-capades, and especially any guy who enjoys something only women should like. Unfortunately, too many people buy into this mindset. Beneath it all though, those guys probably have a group-think mindset, and are a bit insecure if some guy isn't part of the herd.

If a person is attracted to someone of the opposite sex, they're straight. If they're attracted to someone of the same sex, they're gay. If they're attracted to both, they're bisexual. And it's this sole fact that determines their sexual orientation. Too often, people lose sight of this simple fact. That's what clearly happens in this movie.",1487289600,2,1006,4.87719298245614

It all started when an ex-student of his won an academy award for acting as a gay person in a film and gave credit to his English teacher who was gay. This surprised him (Kevin Kline) and his fiance of three years with whom he never had sex. He explained that it was proper to withhold sex until marriage. His priest was surprised that he could do that and suggested that he have sex with her as soon as possible. His marriage to her is in a few days. The actors public comment became known nationally.

Directed by Frank Oz, ""In & Out"" is a comedy about high school English teacher Howard Brackett (a superb Kevin Kline).  The story begins with Howard and his family, including his soon-to-be wife Emily (Joan Cusack, in an Oscar-nominated role), watching the annual Academy Awards on television.  A former student of Howard's, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), wins Best Actor.  Unexpectedly, Cameron thanks Howard in his acceptance speech, and incidentally ""outs"" him as a gay man to Emily, his family, and pretty much the entire world.  What follows is a hilarious media circus around Howard, his marriage, and his apparent obsession with Barbra Streisand.  It's not a ""gay"" film.  You don't have to be gay to enjoy this film.

I've seen it several times and always enjoy it.  You wouldn't believe how funny Tom Selick can be and look so great at the same time.  A cute funny twist on the Joan Kusak role and she is perfect for it. Of course if all you care about is car chases and blood then you should pass on this one.  It's a feel good movie for those who love the genre.",1409875200,5,498,3.900990099009901

4403068,1,B004LQPP4K,"Other than what must have been a desperate measure on the part of Kevin Kline for taking on the title role, there is nothing good about this movie.  For my taste and sensibilities this film is truly out in left field somewhere. It's not that the acting is bad...it's the story that I simply do not and cannot fathom...and I happen to be gay!  It is said that this piece of brilliance was hatched from a true story concerning the acceptance speech given by Tom Hanks, upon winning his best actor Oscar for ""Philadelphia.""  During the ""Let me thank everyone for everything that has happened throughout my life"" phase it seems Mr. Hanks accidentally outed one of his teachers and another student in the bargain. So, here we have the premise for ""In & Out,"" presumably a spoof on that ""Oooops"" moment, but even as a spoof it fails.  It's simply not tongue-in-cheek enough,  funny enough or ridiculous enough to cover the territory.  Using the same backdrop as the original incident, the Academy Awards, and with many, many fine uncredited stars appearing, the writer offers up a very well respected, well liked teacher and coach as the outed victim.  He is from the mid-west and is just about to be married to a ""Twinkie"" eating and overfed, Joan Cusack. It seems that on Oscar night, the entire population of the town is watching the broadcast because a native son is up for the award for Best Actor and they are suddenly catapulted into a world they know very little of because of his acceptance speech.  There doesn't seem to be any other closeted or suspected homosexuals in the town...and certainly no one that is out!  OK...fair enough, but from here the story takes on an Oz like twist.  Our outed teacher does not lose his fiance, friends, family or the support of his students and while he does get fired from his teaching job, comes back ""to support his students"" at graduation and sits on the stage with the school officials!  Scores of reporters descend upon the town to cover this news ""event"" and one of the reporters (Tom Selleck) turns out to be gay!  There is neither horror or hilarity at this unveiling, however, and our teacher tries to show he is not gay. He is being married in just a few days and the wedding is still on. In all the situations set up to make one laugh, the writer falls short of his intended reaction. In the scene with the priest we should have roared, the scene listing the many tips that might have revealed his sexuality should have made us fall down in laughter, his fiance's continued befuddled reaction to all of it, the revelation that he has never slept with his intended and his hasty attempt to do so before the nuptials, the bachelor party replete with blow-up doll and good-old-boy innuendo, his parents puzzled reaction and ongoing stiff upper lip demeanor, the eventual wedding service when he finally utters the dreaded words...""I'm gay""...all should have us sitting with tears rolling down our cheeks from laughter but it all went for nothing.  In all, it would seem his only real penance is that he ends up not winning the ""Teacher of the Year"" award!  There is but one very funny moment in the film and that is when the lady who uses a walker is dancing to ""Macho Man"" by The Village People near the end of the film.  Paul Rudnick, who wrote the screenplay, is himself a gay man and, as such, I cannot understand his treatment of the subject matter. This should have been a hilarious piece for both the homosexual and heterosexual communities and might have brought them closer together, through laughter, as co-inhabitants and neighbors in a crazy world. The film has not accomplished that either. Mr. Rudnick just didn't capitalize on the funny scenarios he, himself, created because he gave all of them short shrift.  I only know that I bought the film, watched the film and am selling my copy as soon as humanly possible to some poor unsuspecting movie goer who cares naught for quality, truth or real comedy!.",1398038400,4,3969,4.640513552068474

Kline does his usual extraordinary job and brings the performance to your living room with grace and depth. Joan Cusack kicks all kinds of ass with her always stellar ability to perform over the top people with a grounded quality that makes them believable and a ""they could live next door"" kind of vibe. Plot moves along and builds quickly with a sensible speed that can only be credited to Frank Oz who always does something special...create characters and situations that entertain and teach a lesson without you even knowing it.
