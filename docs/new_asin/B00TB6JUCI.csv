7003780,1,B00TB6JUCI,"This is not Japanese film.  It is an American, indie film made in Japan by two American brothers with Japanese actors.  I wish I had known.  When I saw their co-writing screen credit and that one is the director, I thought, gee, how Cohen Brothers.  And then, lo and behold the videotape the Japanese character watches is . . .  Fargo!  And the film has to keep the ""joke"" going.  I was grossed out and turned the film off.  Happy I only rented it.",1435881600,,448,4.25

7003784,5,B00TB6JUCI,"Irony! That is how to describe this movie. I never imagined it would end the way it did. The whole plot of this depressed, anti social young girl was a setup for the shocking conclusion. Well done!",1435104000,,197,4.351351351351352

7003787,5,B00TB6JUCI,"This THE best independent film, in the truest sense of the word, that I have seen in years! Featuring a magnificent performance by Rinko Kikuchi as Kumiko, this film defies genre classifications and offers a rare, transcendent experience. Viewing it, one ocillates between between laughter and tears, and is often suspended between them in the same moment. Meticulously filmed with many moments of stunning beauty, this is a unique work of art that has haunted me for weeks and has earned a place as one of my favorite films of all time.

7003788,4,B00TB6JUCI,"It's a charming vista of one's own naive self-destruction; an indie film with dry humor and perfect timing that takes what would normally be a quirky personal adventure and heavily grounds it into reality and makes you hope, like Kumiko, that there's something more important in life than a mundane existence.",1432512000,3,309,5.078431372549019
7003789,4,B00TB6JUCI,"Kumiko The Treasure Hunter (2014 release; 104 min.) brings the story of Kumiko. As the movie opens, we see Kumiko walking alongside the beach with a map, eventually retrieving a VHS tape from under a rock. It turns out to be the movie Fargo, and Kumiko becomes obsessed with it, and in particular the character played Steve Buscemi , who buries a briefcase full of money in the Fargo snow. Meanwhile, we witness Kumiko becoming more and more aloof and isolated in her day-to-day life, including her job as an Office Lady in corporate Japan. Its only when she is watching Fargo that she feels alive. Kumiko eventually decides to go to Fargo. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: the movie is directed, co-written by and stars David Zellner (his brother Nathan co-wrote the script). The story is a fantastical concoction that is loosely based on true events, and when I say loosely, you should read that in the broadest possible meaning. The movies initial 45 minutes play out in Tokyo, and Zellner captures the loneliness and isolation of the Kumiko character, still an Office Lady at age 29, perfectly. When Kumiko is caught trying to steal a huge world atlas from the library and is asked why, Kumiko passionately explains that I am like a Spanish Conquistador, retrieving untold treasures!, to the shock of the library guard. The last hour of the movie plays out in the US, and captures the mood of the frozen tundra and also the mood of the Fargo movie perfectly. When Kumiko is wondering the snowy fields, the movie becomes the anti-Wild movie: rather than finding herself, Kumiko becomes more and more lost. Please note that, like in Wild, there are long stretches in this film where not a word is spoken. Knowing some of the background on the real life events on which this is loosely based, I was quite surprised with the ending offered by this movie Last but not least, there is a great instrumental soundtrack, composed and performed by Austin-based indie band The Octopus Project.

I had read about this movie, and was intrigued by it. Imagine my surprise when Kumiko The Treasure Hunter opened in early April without any pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I went to see it right away and the Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. Which is a shame, as this is a very nice little movie that is quirky and off-center, yet always entertaining if not intriguing. If that sounds like it might appeal to you, you cannot go wrong with this. Kumiko The Treasure Hunter is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1431043200,24,2677,4.730192719486081
7003790,5,B00TB6JUCI,"I saw it 3 times in the theaters.  So good.  Most American audiences will not get it, even though it's actually pretty classical in that a protagonist is pursuing her clear desire through external obstacles.  But she is unusual in that she is vaguely mentally ill, I mean, seriously so--but you never know exactly what her ""diagnosis"" is (probably a psychotic disorder of some kind).  I think the amazing music, and very unorthodox, haunting ending are what really separate this great film.  I loved it.  Rinko Kikuchi tries hard not to be beautiful but we all know she is.  A little indie gem!",1499385600,,594,4.70873786407767

7003792,5,B00TB6JUCI,"Beautifully styled (cinematography and music) - touching, tragic, comedic, mystical and down-to-earth. This movie is a true paradox, marrying the sublime and the ridiculous into an unforgettable work of art. There's almost a fable like quality, where the ultimate outsider, the Holy Fool of legend, longs to transcend the mundane confines of the herd and become the heroine of her own tale. This is far from a simple adventure story -  more a hero's journey that, like Don Quixote, elevates the absurdity of delusion into a noble quest.",1499040000,,536,5.090909090909091
7003793,1,B00TB6JUCI,"Based on untrue events this boring tedious and insulting to mentally ill people film has absolutely no wit irony insight or catharsis. Its just a flatline trek through congested to clear horizons enviornments until the stupid and unlikeable main character dies from stupidity.

Does not the japanese woman whom this urban lie is based on deserve more respect than to be dragged (in this movie)to america to engage in some meaningless search for a big pile of money that,like herself, doesnt exist, when her actual life obviously had some relationships and meaning?

As a fantasy story this one is full of stupid scenes, Kumiko doesnt seem depressed so much as just stupid jealous and mean, she wants the treasure and thats it. Stupid premise and pathetically scripted she steals from then runs from everyone helping her live.  When she finally runs out of people to abuse and dies the movie still goes on! needlessly entertaining her afterlife fantasy of living in a barren white land with nothing/nobody but a bag of money and her rabbit.

I really should have followed my instinct and turned this one off about 20-30 min in. However I did not and have lost a little grey matter, don't waste your mind or time on this pointless drivel.",1494806400,,1236,4.816037735849057

7003801,2,B00TB6JUCI,"I am utterly baffled as to how this movie has such high praise. Sure, the cinematography is beautiful and the lead actress turns in a strong performance, but ultimately the movie tries to paint titular Kumiko as funny and triumphant, when she is clearly mentally unstable and unlikable.  The moments that intend be darkly humorous were uncomfortable as Kumiko teeters between depressive/functional and schizophrenic/delusional. I fell asleep watching this movie, and completed it during the second viewing. Although it is beautifully shot and well acted, I would not give this movie a second viewing, nor would I be able to recommend it to anyone else.",1479340800,,652,5.20952380952381
7003802,5,B00TB6JUCI,"The quest for the lost treasure of a suitcase full of money (Fargo fans will understand the reference more acutely) spurs this misanthropic Japanese woman on an adventure to redeem her destiny.  Stuck in a job she detests, coworkers who show little interest in anything besides eyelash extensions and a mother who is frustrated with Kumiko's lack of success in traditional Japanese values placed upon work and marriage Kumiko sets out to forge her own path.  The first half of the movie is decidedly quiet, introspective, insular in revealing Kumiko's isolating nature then picks up the pace as she embarks on her journey in North Dakota.  Rinko Kikuchi is a breathtaking talented actress who brings true humanity to her role as Kumiko.  Even in silence, her face expresses a thousand words.  Definitely worth the time if you are into independent movies with a quiet energy and characters who stay with you long after the movie is over.",1478822400,5,936,4.936305732484076

7003806,1,B00TB6JUCI,"This film looked to be off center in all the right ways for me, but I just didn't like it.  It can be interesting to watch someone work thru the puzzling aspects of another culture and laugh/sigh with them when things don't go right and cheer when they have relieving breakthroughs.  But it only works when you have some sympathy for the character, and I didn't with Kumiko.  She comes across as a childish mentally off person with a simple and sad inner life.

I relish plot incongruencies, lingering camera shots, fringe characters, and wry cultural stereotyping.  This movie brushes against a lot of alternative filmmaking touchstones, but in an obvious and uninteresting way.",1475971200,,679,4.921052631578948

The lead character failed to spark any sympathy or interest and her ""treasure hunting"" seemed like just plain crazy. The music by the Octopus Project was awful--poorly timed and discordant without serving or assisting the weak plot or on-screen action in any way.

It is supposed to be based on a true story but if you look into it, it's about as ""based on"" the actual events as ""Psycho"" and ""Texas Chainsaw"" were inspired by Ed Gein.

It really just shuffled along rather predictably and then slowly settled into anticlimax. It doesn't seem to reward after digestion; in the days following my viewing, I never managed to find a greater appreciation upon deeper reflection. In a nutshell, I was amused at first and then steadily bored and ultimately unsatisfied.

I can't complain about its production though. Camera, set, sound, wardrobe, cast, et cetera was all perfectly decent. A shame all that effort didn't go toward a better story.

7003843,4,B00TB6JUCI,"Telling you more than what's in the movie's description could ruin it for you, so I'll stick to why you should or shouldn't watch Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter.

When a film's POV is solely focused on a single character, the character needs to be interesting enough and the actor compelling enough to keep the audience engaged for its duration. Rinko Kikuchi as the title character, Kumiko, is nothing less than a home run. She portrays the weird and dysfunctional Kumiko so completely that you stop seeing the actress and only see the character. There are a number of wonderful supporting performances but Rinko deserves every second of her screen time.

The second big plus for me was the film's atmosphere. I know that sounds a little vague, but the cinematography and sound design are themselves a fantastic supporting character. It's beautifully shot and often times nearly silent with only exactly what you need to hear pressing through your speakers. If you're a fan of visual storytelling, this is a huge win.

What might reduce the number of satisfied viewers is its stark, harsh narrative. It's fair to call Kumiko a dark comedy, but tragedy is the heavier tone throughout. The film's dry sensibilities and long, uncomfortable scenes make for, at times, a tense viewing experience. But that's what the filmmakers want you to feel.

Overall the movie is wonderfully realized. This personal, challenging journey is well worth the ride. Just be ready for an emotional experience that could end with both a tear and a smile.",1459296000,4,1528,4.95703125

7003868,2,B00TB6JUCI,"I picked this movie solely based on the cover. I knew nothing about the backstory of the movie or it's origins. So, I watched in absolute disbelief at the arc the character Kumiko was taking. She seemed (to me) to be a very stupid and unbelievable character, and as such, I just could not get into anything she was doing. I found her to be a very unsympathetic character. So much of the movie seemed predictable too. The scene in which she steals the atlas and runs outside, the camera holds on the doors, it seemed almost guaranteed she'd be coming right back in after being apprehended. (And why did she need the whole atlas anyway since it would've been easier just to take the one page she needed or better still, just buy a map once she reached North Dakota.) Likewise, after she picked up her bosses suit and walks down the street, the camera holds on a bright blue trash container, it didn't take a genius to realize she was going to return in frame to throw it in that barrel. Why also would her boss send her such an errand with the company credit card when it was blatantly obvious that she was very disgruntled? Anyway, after she abandons her bunny on a train, I just couldn't get behind anything she did. I won't spoil the ending for anyone that wants to see it but, I found even that to be quite predictable. Afterwards, I just had to go online to see what others were saying about this movie. That's where I first learned about the true story of Takako Konishi. Unlike the fabricated urban legend Kumiko is based on, Takako's actual story is totally relatable, sympathetic and tragic. I cannot fathom why the filmmakers thought telling this version of her final days was the better way to go. But then again, who am I to criticize? It seems this picture has received an abundance of praise. It's rather odd though, I still like the cover picture. I guess you can't judge films by their covers either.",1453507200,4,1914,4.4714285714285715

7003874,5,B00TB6JUCI,"This movie is slow paced and dual language.

 I love this movie, but it is not for most people.

Kumiko truly believes in buried treasure and when one of her hunts gives her a VHS copy of Fargo she believes it is a treasure map that she must decode in order to find the money.

But if your expecting an action packed treasure hunt movie than this isn't want you want.

Most of the movie isn't about the treasure, or even treasure hunting, it's about why she does it in spite of the fact it's not real. Even when someone tries to tell her it's not real she refuses to believe it. She's gone to far and lost to much to not go for it.

She doesn't seem stupid, she has books filled with little details from the film and scours over maps researching where it could be.

The main character has at least some kind of undiagnosed mental illness I guessed she was on the autism spectrum with added depression due to how she has difficulty talking to or even looking at people and how she is treated by her family.

The first half of this movie is in Japanese due to the main character being Japanese while the second half is in English which we 'the audience' can understand but Kumiko seems to have very little knowledge of.

SPOILERS

I find the slow pace fitting as we see how she slowly sinks deeper into her obsession as her family and her work begin to crumble around her.

The ending was especially unsettling as we see her mother yell at her when she needs help which only pushes her on her quest to find the fake treasure to the point where she dies believing she found it because in the end it was all she had.

The scene where she sets her rabbit 'free' is heartbreaking. Not only because of how Bunzo is the only real good thing in her life, but also because we know that she is doing all of this for nothing.

But like I said this isn't for everyone or at least not for when you want a 'fun' movie. Whatever that means.",1451865600,,1924,4.195652173913044
7003875,4,B00TB6JUCI,Good movie. Kind of quirky. Has some sad parts. Humorous parts also. Kumiko is an interesting character for sure Partly in Japanese with subtitles and partly in English.,1450828800,,169,5.071428571428571
7003876,3,B00TB6JUCI,"I have such mixed feelings about Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter. The cinematography was exquisite, Mrs. Kikuchi's acting was deeply touching, the long pauses in some scenes let the gravity soak in, and the whole look of the movie was just superb for me. The whole time I thought I was going to love it as a quirky, deep, pensive, art movie...however now that is over I'm left with a feeling of confusion and sadness for Kumiko; maybe that's the point. The movie builds up suspense and compassion for the excellently played main character, but there's never really a climax or resolution for me. I'm glad that Bunzo was there in the end - a suggestion that she had completely detached from reality, or more likely life.

For parents. The movie is almost entirely clean of objectional scenes, except for the blood stained character in the movie she watches several times, however the intense/dark music and the weight of some scenes would probably be disturbing. No violence, cussing, nudity, etc. PG'ish.

P.S. - Here's the urban legend this movie is based on and the true story behind it. Worth reading if you're left wondering where the inspiration came from: http://kotaku.com/the-real-story-behind-kumiko-the-treasure-hunter-1694010461",1450483200,3,1235,5.201005025125628

7003982,5,B00TB6JUCI,"Simple script, wonderfully executed.  The Kumiko character was brilliant. Fairly realistic depiction of how thankless and cruel Japanese corporate culture can be as well as societal pressures for woman reaching her 30's in Japan.  Her story was so sad and brought a few tears to my eyes.  Despite her mental illness I couldn't help admiring her determination, faith and passion for discovery.  She had a strong Japanese spirit and never gave up. Never was a big fan of the Fargo movie, and didn't know anything about the urban legend of the Japanese woman who died in Detroit Lakes. I thought it was real creative how they integrated that story line into this one the camera work was great, acting was great and the story flowed well with some pretty humorous twists.  I am a native Minnesotan and spent a couple years teaching English in Japan so I have a strong connection to both cultures.  I can understand how someone without these natural connections may have a harder time relating to the story.

7004024,3,B00TB6JUCI,"People who loved the Coen Brother's movie ""Fargo"" might have a passing interest in this movie.  You know the story of the Japanese woman who died in the snow looking for the buried suitcase full of money?  It turns out she wasn't really looking for the money.  The speculation now is that she wanted to commit suicide in the snow and Fargo was the hometown of her American ex-lover.  Before this alleged correction to the fictional treasure story emerged, there was much finger pointing at the Coen Brothers for adding the un-true caption at the start of the film:  ""This is a true story"".  Now the movie ""Kumiko"" emerges as a kind of fictional imagining of how a Japanese woman might have come to search for buried treasure in American snow country.  I thought it was kind of an interesting film in terms of its portrayal of Japanese culture - particularly surrounding the bias toward viewing unmarried women over 25 as being ""over the hill"".  But all of this is speculation.  The movie is not so compelling that I watched it in one sitting.  But it's not boring.  It's just slow-paced.  It has a sense of humor, particularly surrounding the cultural misunderstandings.  The cop at one point brings the Japanese woman to a Chinese restaurant to find a translator.  This stuff is comedy gold.  But the laughs are few and far between.  The filmmakers have some curiosity and sympathy for the Japanese woman as you can see by their handling of the subject matter.",1445299200,7,1461,4.692913385826771
7004025,5,B00TB6JUCI,"This is an amazing portrayal of the descent into mental illness. Kumiko had been slowly slipping into worse health while her employer and family remained oblivious and insensitive, as it too often the case in the real world. She had become depressed and paranoid, and began having grandiose delusions. With no support extended to her by her peers, likely unaware that Kumiko was not well, Kumiko was left alone to follow her delusions to their inevitable consequences. This film isn't set in a fictional world where the unimaginable happens every day, it's set in the world that we all live in. This film isn't a flight of fancy, it's telling a story that occurs with tragic consistently in our society today. If you're looking for Harry Potter, Tomb Raider or Indiana Jones, you won't find it here. If you're looking for a film that will give you an understanding of what so many millions of mentally ill people go through day to day, and how little help and understanding they receive, then you'll likely be glad you watched this.",1445212800,6,1032,4.770949720670391
7004026,5,B00TB6JUCI,"This movie exists in two parts I think the second part is a little longer than the first but they are roughly equal. The first part is in Japan and it was in Japanese with English subtitles. I don't like reading subtitles but there wasn't much dialog so it wasn't so bad. The second part is in America (Minnesota, North Dakota) and is in English, this was much nicer for me :) To begin with I liked the look of this film. I thought it was very beautiful almost every scene I found attractive and engaging I wanted to travel to these spots and see them for myself.
I haven't ever really fit in anywhere. I don't really understand people and they don't understand me. I have spent most of my life alone and afraid trying to find that one magic bullet that will make everything alright. Sometimes I think that it is all just a nightmare and I will wake up to my big house and my loving family. But there isn't any magic bullet and when I wake there isn't any reprieve.
I loved Kumiko (the character). On the outside I thought that she was as lovely as the movie itself. On the inside I could very easily identify with her struggles. Things were going wrong for her and she didn't know how to fix them. She was hurting people and she didn't want to.... and she couldn't stop. But then she heard of a silver bullet that could make all the pain go away. She went on an incredible trek in an effort to set everything right. I'm not going to tell you if it worked or not.... I will tell you that if you are open to this type of experience then this particular movie will melt your heart.",1445126400,6,1579,4.214521452145214

7004033,5,B00TB6JUCI,"If you like movies that are strange and different, then sit back and watch KUMIKO, THE TREASURE HUNTER.
It fits both of those adjectives and more.
KUMIKO is about obsession and madness, fantasy and reality, sadness, fear, humor, tugged heartstrings and quirkiness.
It's a Japanese film about a woman in Tokyo who finds an old videotape of the American movie FARGO.
She plays it over and over and keeps a detailed notebook about her findings, making measurements and calculations from the scene where Steve Buscemi buries the suitcase full of money in the snow by the fence.
She thinks of herself as a conquistador who has discovered buried treasure and sets out to claim it. It is, as she states, her destiny.
In some ways it reminded me of a French movie I saw back in the '70s, THE STORY OF ADELE H., based on a story by Victor Hugo which was indeed about obsession and madness...but only in the obsession and madness department.  KUMIKO has a few other departments as well.

Disaffected and unsatisfied with her life, and evidently sporting some underlying mental issues, she goes off to seek her fortune. This is more an art house film and it takes a laboriously long time to get anywhere.

7004065,4,B00TB6JUCI,"This movie was unique to me because usually when some kind of epic trip is forecast in a movie, the beginning of that trip (or the decision not to make the trip) marks the end of the movie.  So we realize the primary point of the movie was not the success of the trip itself, but whether or not characters would grow to know that the epic journey was what they needed (or not) for their existences.

So it blew my mind to actually see this movie run about half way through in Japan, and then complete the second half in Minnesota.  I think this gave the movie value added over the original story of its type, which would be Bartleby the Scrivener.  The idea being, what exactly befalls the person who has no independent means yet refuses to compromise with society's demands as  far as what they must do to earn a living?",1444608000,,821,4.305194805194805

She then travels to Minnesota in the winter and starts her odyssey, she understands and speaks limited English you can see her thinking about what has been said to her and how she should answer. At times she seems to understand English better and sometimes not so much. There are a couple of misunderstandings, but I didn't find them humourous.

Depending whose point of view you take when watching this film, depends if it is a success and a comedy, or a sad, frightening look into mental illness.

I kept switching back and forth in my point of view; and as I did I kept thinking turn this thing off...or watch a little more...

Kumiko sees herself as special, a heroine; everyone else sees her as a failure, social outcast, screw-up; even her mother.
She has a dead end job and boss that tells her she is going to be let go, no friends, no money...oh but she does have a rabbit...

She doesn't seem particularly impaired intellectually, so I am guessing she has delusions related to depression. IF you are depressed it might make you feel better to see someone else in your boat, or you may want to shake the spit out of her...or just turn the movie off as Kumiko's depression sucks you down like quicksand.

Ms Kikuchi has won awards for her acting, so she convinces you. The supporting actors do well also. No feeling of fake here except that the situation exists at all.

 It is in Japanese...though I don't think you would even have to read the English to get what was being portrayed...except the Mom's telephone calls. Ergo, don't remember any bad language. Don't remember any racy scenes. Kumiko overwhelms you.

The reward is at the very end...depending if you have taken the heroine's view or not. Frankly I fast forwarded after suffering through 30 minutes, and watched the last part after she goes to America...and even though I missed some of the movie (I am not tempted to go back and see it) the surprise ending was a neat twist...that I wasn't sure if I liked...a lot...or if I was frustrated.",1444262400,,1751,4.518987341772152

7004132,5,B00TB6JUCI,"This is the type of film that some folks will really like and others find confusing or depressing.  Though written and directed by the Zellner brothers, this film actually has a Japanese feel that fans of Kurosawa might appreciate.  The camera lingers on some scenes (like the opening sequence) allowing the sense of place to develop in the viewer.  Some of the snowy winter shots (in color) nevertheless present light/dark abstract patterns that create a subliminal sense of mood.  There is also a sense of ambiguity about the opening and closing of the film: what is ""real"" and what did Kumiko imagine?

The story itself is a tragedy showing a young woman's withdrawal from reality.  Her life has become as messy as her apartment and her un-emptied mailbox.  She is driven by an idee fixe concerning buried treasure, the finding of which might instantly transform her life without the necessity to work and engage reality in a constructive way.  Rinko Kikuchi (Academy Award nominee for her work in ""Babel"") does a fantastic job with this character, even though the character speaks very little.

If you like unambiguous stories that move to a clear destination, then you may not appreciate this film.  If you want a film to engage your imagination and invite you to think outside the box, then you may like this very much.  I think that it is excellent for a film of this genre.",1443830400,7,1381,4.784810126582278

7004156,2,B00TB6JUCI,"Lonely, 29 yr old Kumiko is an office worker.  By 30, Japanese culture requires she be married. This is true. She doesn't have any prospects and makes a decision - a crazy decision.

She has decided that the treasure in the movie _Fargo_ is real and through extensive research, believes she knows where it is buried in rural Minnesota. She gets to the USA and a number of people help her.

Typical of a midwesterner, the deputy sherif took Kumiko, a Japanese person, to a Chinese restaurant hoping for translation.  I was just like that when I was younger, so it isn't a stretch.  ""Asians"" all speak one language after all. ;)

Eventually, after multiple petty-theft crimes, she is seen running from a cab which shows $117 on the meter. How she decided this was the place to start walking isn't explained.  If you've ever been to this part of the country, in winter, with snow on the ground, you know how unlikely that is. She runs across a field with the cab in the background wearing new-to-her stolen coat, snowpants, boots, but no gloves/mittens and no hat. She walks for many hours through the tundra eventually arriving at the center of a frozen lake. She sees the ""treasure"" and chips away at the ice. Appears to be about 8 inches thick. She retrieves the case holding the treasure from the water, but it is just a small log. More walking. By this point, her hands would have been frozen through - forget frostbite - frozen.  She walks into the night in the blowing snow - hey - it's a movie.

Morning comes, fresh snow everywhere, seems very picturesque. and the dream-state-music begins. In the real world, she would have frozen to death just after sunset, if she made it that long. The movie continues to an unexpected ending.

Bunzo is the best part of this movie.  The other supporting characters just don't have enough development to matter.

BTW - Tokyo has a climate similar to Atlanta/Chattanooga, so she would have been completely unprepared for this trek into rural Minnesota, in winter.

I tend to watch as many Asian-related movies as I can. Traveled all over Asia (always more to see) and I HAD to watch this out of curiosity. I don't feel better for having watched it, sadly. A movie about a functional mentally ill person doesn't work for me without more humor.",1443312000,5,2284,4.623762376237623

The title character Kumiko takes off from her dreary bank job in Japan on a treasure hunt to find a briefcase full of cash in the snow in Fargo, in the US. The problem is, this cash is a vision she has from her obsession over the movie ""Fargo."" The first half of the film is in Japan, showing us the unbearable physical and psychological limits of her life; the second half is a tragi-comic journey to and through America. It's not hard to figure out how this film ends. It's a character study, and the best thing about it is the emotive, believable acting of Rinko Kikuchi, who US movie fans may recognize from the action-sci-fi blockbuster ""Pacific Rim.""

The people who met Kumiko seemed to be trying in their own way to help her - even though it seemed like they could not really see her point of view, or were unwilling to see her point of view.  It was an interesting way to portray how people might not be aware of how they are helping themselves more than helping someone else.

Most stylistic choicesincluding the use of musicare totally in the head of the authors, never go with the storyline (not even in any interesting indirect way). The attempt to create a Cohen Brothers'-kind of quirky humour fails most of the time. Slow pace very contrived and the choice of wide format also almost useless until the very end of the film.

You'll feel nothing, you'll get nothing, and you'll be two hours into the future. If you want to waste more time, analyze plot holes (Why would someone with a steady job need to steal a company credit card when you live on a budget of rabbit food, take out, and a crappy apartment? Why, again, would someone with a steady job not leave the country with some kind of currency or bank card on hand? Did she ever live? Why didn't she just throw the rabbit on the train tracks like a good psychopath? While on rabbits, when has a rabbit ever eaten noodles? Why would someone embroider a treasure map to a VHS tape of 'Fargo' in a man-constructed cave on an inaccessible beach [unless it was her, in which case, what movie did she get that from {in which case, can we waste another two hours on a prequel?}?]? ). Even more time to waste? Simple.... Think about who read this script and thought it was a great movie to be made, and dream of ways to prevent them from making more drivel like this.",1442188800,,1141,4.2146118721461185
7004248,5,B00TB6JUCI,"This is one of my favorite movies that I've seen this year. The plot is both original and intriguing and the acting is very well done. I really love the costuming and cinematography; Kumiko is a character that you're not going to see anywhere else. The hotel comforter that she wears as a coat is especially unforgettable (and how she makes it look so cool is beyond me).

Some viewers interpret Kumiko's story to be that of an emotionally unstable woman who becomes obsessed with a movie and the tragic downward spiral that results in her pursuit of it. It's understandable how someone would see this as a sad movie with an unhappy ending.

However, I don't think this film is about mental illness or tragedy -- it's about rebelling against society. Everyone in Kumiko's life is pressuring her to find a man and settle down: Her mother wants her to move back home. Her condescending boss tells her that she's getting too old for her job in the office. Her friends only talk about eyelash extensions and having kids. She feels trapped.

Then, miraculously, Kumiko sees her only chance for greatness: finding the buried treasure from the movie ""Fargo."" And she TOTALLY goes for it! She leaves her home, her job, even her beloved rabbit, Bunzo, to go to North Dakota in the middle of winter to search for treasure that nobody else believes exists. That takes an incredible amount of bravery. She's alone. She's risking everything. She's unstoppable.

And so what if the treasure wasn't real? Her dedication and resilience are beyond impressive. When her bus broke down on the road to Fargo, she didn't wait for the repairs; she just got out and started WALKING down the highway in the middle of a snowstorm. Few characters go to the lengths she went to in pursuit of their dreams. In the end, Kumiko manages to escape her oppressive society and find peace. Her efforts are NOT belittled by the fact that she doesn't succeed, which is why this movie isn't sad; it's inspirational.",1442188800,,1977,4.721739130434782
7004249,1,B00TB6JUCI,Terrible movie that basically chronicles the life of a mentally unstable woman from office land Japan.

That someone who has lost the meaning of life goes on a search for it and it takes them to a crazy cold world far from home and they show the crazy courage to follow that need.... a very moving story, at least potentially. But the end of the film was a huge let down, it made me angry. It was like the director just decided she was crazy and, of course, crazy ends up with death. An intellectual and soulless solution to the problem of meaning in a person's life. Watch the extra scenes included with the video and you will see the flippant attitude in all its empty glory. It is like the director couldn't figure out a real solution and just tossed in a trite end so he could put the film in the can.  The actress was very good and could have pulled off the transformation that would have redeemed her character and ultimately the film. I don't  even mind dark films which end in a bleak tragedy. If the director had said something in his story telling that made me understand the necessity of the end it would have been something I could appreciate. I don't usually bother with a negative reaction toward a film but when I was asked by amazon to review it weeks after I watched it all the upset returned. I want to ask why, why in the name of all the gods of story did you waste this opportunity to do something beautiful with an important story? Why did you trivialize it at the end? Did you just get stuck and then give up? You really pissed me off! Who the hell let you get away with this?

7004268,1,B00TB6JUCI,"The voice in my head adamantly declares that this movie had no reason to be created.  Of course, why I continued watching it is a pertinent question.  I read through some of the other reviews trying to find a clue as to what wast the point of this thing.  One person wrote that it ""defies genre classification.""  That's certainly true.  Fantasy, episodic journey film, can't be coming of age cuz she was already beyond the age by which a woman was supposed to be married in Japan.  One person wrote it provided a ""rare, transcendental experience"" which makes me wonder what commonplace transcendental he has to compare this film with.

Please don't say it offers a commentary on cultural deficiencies.  The woman is a complete idiot, totally unprepared for the trip.  While in America, everyone treats her so nicely and none try to get something in return.  The police officer even assures her when she tried to kiss him that he is simply trying to help her; he is married with two kids.

The acting of everyone except the lead -- who plays it catatonic much of the way -- is excellent.  And of course the cinematography is . . . um . . . ok, I'll use the b word . . . breathtaking in the last half.  But hey, when you have to resort to ""Hey, the acting was really good"" or god forbid, talk about the cinematography, ignoring the story, you are in trouble.

7004273,3,B00TB6JUCI,"The first 30+ minutes are in Japanese and the subtitles were almost impossible to read about half the time because the background was too light. The final hour is in English although Kumiko does not seem to speak or understand a lot. There were some humorous scenes like trying to steal the library reference book and talking to the security guard about her ""destiny."" Why she didn't photocopy the one page she needed as the guard suggested instead of trying to steal it she had no answer for. Times like that I thought she was dim or had a low IQ.

She was not suited to a mundane office job or the social role her mother wanted her to take on. But it is not clear why she was always showing up to work looking disheveled (uneven haircut, disheveled) or why she stayed in that job after it evolved into running personal errands for her boss after work. Abandoning her only friend and companion (pet rabbit) on a commuter train after trying to free it in a park was odd. I guess it illustrated how desperate & obsessed she was about finding a treasure so she could be ""free"" to do anything she wanted (?). I still have no idea what she wanted to do with her life and she offered no clues about that.

The movie was odd but the directors/writing never connected me to the main character. I just didn't empathize with her and I often found her annoying and unsympathetic. The ending was not realistic. I guess she was dead or it was a dream? The movie probably deserves two stars for being too long but the humorous scenes (like the two missionaries at the airport) and her smile at the end earned it three from me.

I most enjoyed the culture encounters once arriving in the US.  They are subtle, but anyone who has lived outside the United States would probably see them vividly.  Obviously Kumiko was not content with her life, but if you think about the characters she encounters, none of them seem to be totally happy either.  There were plenty of missed opportunities for a lesson about contentment or a reward after taking a risk, but instead was left with the overwhelmingly depressing message that no matter what, we will all die unhappy and happiness is only in our imagination.

Tis reviewer liked it a whole lot.",1517184000,,311,4.032258064516129
8701189,1,B00TB6JUCI,"I have seen many movies in my life. This could be the worst. The heroine, for lack of a better word, was spiteful, moody, passive aggressive, depressed and moronic. I'm sure some people will try to find an allegory of determination in it. Or a fantasy of determination. The character is delusional and the film's denouement only too predictable. Too bad. The actress is good looking.",1513209600,,383,4.818181818181818
