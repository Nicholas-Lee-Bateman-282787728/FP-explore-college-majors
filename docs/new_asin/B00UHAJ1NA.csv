7040641,2,B00UHAJ1NA,"The description really doesn't match the movie. I am a Prime Member so I did not have to pay anything to watch this film. First off most of the actors/and actresses were pretty good at their craft. The plot was ambitious and really not put together all that well. The film keeps flashing between the mentally ill guy who is accused of taking the child while his hallucinations become a separate reality that he is living through..The way it was disclosed in the film was very confusing. I suppose at the end the viewer is supposed to decide if he is really mentally ill or could have a demon been involved...I suppose I wasted over an hour of my time. Who knows, you may like the film. It seems that many viewers do.",1496793600,7,716,4.390977443609023
7040642,2,B00UHAJ1NA,"""The Haunting of Emily"" (2016) and ""Delirium"" (2012) are the same film. After being missing for a whole year, Emily (Taylor Pigeon) magically appears. She does not speak. She lives primarily with her mom Rachel (Jolene Kay) and step father Tim (Nathan Polzin).  Barry (Chris Gann) has visitation rights two days a week for 4 hours each. Tim suffers from demonic hallucinations. Rachel hears scratches and Barry comes across as not as nice guy. While trying to figure out what is happening...

Much of the film is about Tim and his alternate reality, sometimes in black and white, sometimes with a red filter, and sometimes looking like reality. I am sure there is some meaning there I missed.  I thought the female characters looked too much alike. Then there was the opening scene which was a big WTF which they tie into the ending. Acting was fair.

7040643,5,B00UHAJ1NA,This movie was worth every penny. They had beautiful cinematography and plenty of edge of your seat moments!,1441411200,,108,5.055555555555555
7040644,5,B00UHAJ1NA,"This film is an interesting one. It is a great film on the surface with a very complicated story. For being an INDIE, I would say this is more of a thriller film than a horror film. It doesn't rely on scares or pop-outs, rather it has a lot of dialogue- So be prepared. The performances are overall very good. The only stand out performance truly is by the lead, Nathan Polzin. I wasn't a big fan of the girl who played the child social services worker, ""Beth."" The detective character is very enjoyable however.

Some might criticize this film for it's confusing story, which to some extent is true, however if you really pay attention I would say you can put most of it together and fully understand it by the end. There is a very big twist halfway through.

As for production value, most of it looks great. Some parts not so much.

4.5/5",1438041600,2,840,4.371794871794871
7040645,2,B00UHAJ1NA,"This movie sounded real good so I ordered it. I watched it the other day and I was very let down. For one it was hard to understand at first. As the movie played out I started getting it, but by then I was bored and wanted the movie to end already. As for the horror there barely was any. For a horror movie and there to be no horror is a let down. Just like the so called horror movie Toad Road I was let down cause there was no horror. Ok there was some blood and some supernatural mumbo jumbo and a chick attacked someone and was eating him. Smh.... I'm sick of this type of garbage. When a movie is labeled horror it better have horror and not just 15 minutes of it and thats it. Cause thats what it seemed like when the horror kicked in 15 lousy minutes. People if you read this please don't waste your money on this. I will say this about the movie the acting wasn't bad just in the end you will be let down. 2 stars cause the acting wasn't bad.",1435968000,4,951,3.9583333333333335
7040646,4,B00UHAJ1NA,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I had no clue what to expect from DELIRIUM when I found it in my mailbox.  I had never heard of it before, but the cover art looked cool and the premise was intriguing.  I didn't need much more prompting than that, so I threw it in my player and gave it a look.  WOWcall me impressed!  This slick, low-budget horror/thriller is well made and very entertaining.  And although it is not perfect, it is a heck of a film, and it is one I recommend every horror/thriller fan give a shot!

Director Jared Black has a bright future ahead of him if he can keep producing films like this.  It is well fleshed out and original, two characteristics that films in the horror genre are slowly losing.  With a few more films under his belt, Ill bet Black becomes a household name in the genre world.

DELIRIUM is shot very well and looks good onscreen for the most part.  A few of the darker scenes are sorta grainy, not due in part to lighting but the use of a cheap(er) video camera.  This is nothing that detracts from the film as a whole, and I would expect Black will remedy this in the future when better equipment is available.

The acting is really good as well, with Nathan Polzin heading up a nice cast.  I am not familiar with the faces in this film, however they all do a great job in their roles, particularly Polzin.

The story in DELIRIUM is the big winner here, but it is also a part of what keeps this from being a perfect film.  I know thats confusing, but just bear with me.  The film is a taut and riveting thriller that keeps you guessingbut it also has a very nice twist about halfway through.  I found myself smiling after the twist occurredbut then I realized I had paused the film to make sure I knew what was going on.  As such, I feel like the twist might have been executed a little too abruptly, and thus it throws the viewer for a loop for a few seconds.  Youll have to see the film to understand where Im coming from here, and I highly recommend you do.

DELIRIUM is still a big win for me, and I suggest you give it a chance.  Dread Central reviewed it and said, a chance to rise above and be the next micro-budget film to set the world on fire.  I agree; its a great film and showcases director Jared Blacks talents.  I truly hope to see more from him in the future.  DELIRIUM is available now in a variety of formats.",1433721600,5,2410,4.198257080610022

7040648,4,B00UHAJ1NA,3.5 Stars to be honest. It was decently acted and well made. The story is a bit disjointed but easier to follow once you know what is actually going on. However the ending was a bit weird because you aren't sure if that actually happened or not and it never tells you. It's worth a watch though.,1501977600,,295,4.192982456140351

7040650,1,B00UHAJ1NA,This movie jumped around so much it was stupid.  They had an idea for the movie but it went off in so many ways that hell I don't know who the sister was.  Don't waste your time the acting sucked too.,1500163200,4,200,3.8536585365853657

7040652,3,B00UHAJ1NA,"Nice movie, good story. the ending sucked. Ending came  out of nowhere, and did not go with the rest of story line. also the reveal in the middle kind of made the rest of the movie just fizz out.",1499644800,,195,4.0
7040653,1,B00UHAJ1NA,The presentation is quite messy. There are many parts that are so not logical. It's not scary at all.,1499558400,2,101,4.368421052631579

8706850,3,B00UHAJ1NA,"This movie ratings-wise was a bit of a bumpy ride for me; I started off giving it 3 stars, but the middle got a little too 'off-the-rails' (confusing) for me so I changed it to 2 stars. But the ending was good - it was unexpected and it creeped me out, so it went back up to a 3. This was one of those flicks where it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense at times, but you have to stay with it and watch it right up to the end. Parts of it were confusing (and reminded me of a couple of those strange Icelandic films I've seen on here); the 'sex part' towards the middle of the story I thought was a bit overdone (this was supposed to be the missing girl's story, so it looked like the directors just threw this in there to spice up the screen a little). Also, some of it wasn't explained very well - I couldn't tell who was sane and who wasn't, but this element turned out to be part of what made the story interesting. The lead actor (Nathan Polzin) I thought did a respectable job playing (adult) Tim (the kid was good too); I couldn't quite figure him out most of the way, and the ending gave me creepy chills up and down my spine. I won't throw in any Spoilers in this review (because really, who likes reading those?) - but I will say that overall it was a good mind-bender/ psychological thriller. Not the best I've ever seen, but the cast deserves some credit for their efforts in making this somehow all work by the end. It made me think about how vulnerable children really are, and how they should find their homes as a place of safety and protection but sometimes... well, enough said here.",1533427200,,1607,4.170418006430868
8706851,3,B00UHAJ1NA,"Wow! This movie started out very confusing, but I kept watching and waiting for it to make sense.  Finally it did start to make sense and it got interesting and I was enjoying the movie, but then it went down hill for me. I did not understand the ending. I might have to watch again to see if things make more sense the second time around!?",1505692800,,340,4.151515151515151
8706852,4,B00UHAJ1NA,"In the spirit of Memento, this movie makes you wonder what is real and that is exactly why it is so good.
The only secure fact that you as the veiwer knows is that a little girl is in danger. 2 parallel storylines are woven to create an excellent illusion of exactly how and what that danger might be.
It pulls the 2 seperate, but cohesive, storylines slowly together until the final reveal in which you finally understand what was reality and what was not with that fact remaining that the little girl is still in need of being saved.
Add just a touch of supernatural and gore, and this movie really kept me interested.
The acting was solid for most the characters, the cinematography done very nicely, and the direction was quality.
I held back 1 star just for the few parts that the dialogue faltered.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie to those who enjoy slow plot reveals and the type of horror that is not really in your face but more of a slow burn. This was psychological horror/mystery and it achieved exactly what it set out to.",1505692800,,1056,4.443298969072165

8706859,4,B00UHAJ1NA,"I am ""spoken"" from IMDb, and the stars should be 3.5, or 7/10.  I happen to like disjointed movies that make you pay attention to details, like exactly when did the story start to hint at the primary plot turn and/or twist.  I do understand the disappointment others felt, getting cheated by a misleading plot summary and a convoluted/disjointed series of events.  It's not to everyone's tastes, and I sympathize.  My only problem is being unclear about the 1-year disappearance, but further description would cause spoilers.  Give it a shot if you like the jump-around kind of flick.",1502841600,2,584,4.918367346938775
