8328770,2,B001O1RYFS,"I couldn't make it past ten minutes into it. This has low budget trash written all over it. It may be funny, but getting teeth pulled waiting for funny isn't my idea of a good time.",1503446400,2,181,4.055555555555555
8328771,2,B001O1RYFS,"This is the sequel to Shred and even at the start of this movie, the title is Shred II. So I'm confused by the name Revenge of the Boarding School Dropouts. In addition, there is like a 5 second delay between the sound and frame, so it's just awkward to watch when the voices don't line up.",1500249600,2,290,4.105263157894737
