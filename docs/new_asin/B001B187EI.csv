3479144,1,B001B187EI,"Crystals and all... This is not a pretty sight.
I suggest you not purchase this if you are looking for some insight into true Native American ritual.  This is really just not authentic to me at all.",1257811200,10,198,4.351351351351352
3479160,1,B001B187EI,"I was disappointed in this purchase as I was looking for an authentic Native American product.  I lead a women's Bible study and spirituality group and we had been doing a study on world faiths.  Of course, we wanted to look at the spiritual paths of the First Nations, so I went looking for multi-media resources specifically about storytelling.  THIS was NOT a good choice for us.

If you are looking for a funky, new age experience with a bunch of women who seem to be from Germanic countries, this is for you.  Something about it lacks sincerity and honesty.

Other than it being borderline offensive to Native peoples, it is an annoying production with eery music and a creepy overdubbed narration.  Ms. Fast Wolf is undoubtedly a beautiful, grandmotherly woman with quite a strong presence, but I wonder what her clan (if she is truly of one) really feels about her practices.

Save your money and look for more authentic Native American resources.",1291680000,7,954,4.774390243902439
3479161,5,B001B187EI,"This DVD gives a look into practices that can put your feet on solid ground and create transformation and balance.  I have known Oh Shinnah for 20 years and the ""not authentic"" label of a reviewer is just not true.  I went on the Journey of the Waters and I find words inadequate for describing the incredibly positive impact it has had on my life.  I own this DVD and often give it to people I know are seeking  spiritual tools for living in the challenging times we are in.  It is beautifully put together.",1282608000,2,508,4.3052631578947365
3479162,5,B001B187EI,"It was so exciting when I found out this DVD was made of OhShinnah and her teachings.... I have been studying with her for more than 30 years, and am
amoung her students who have been urging her to write a book... This is better!
This DVD is so visually beautiful, and the teachings are set in the context of daily life for anyone.  I enjoyed it very much and have been gifting copies to friends and family!!",1281830400,2,408,4.230769230769231
3479163,5,B001B187EI,"Beauty is what Oh Shinnah is about. This is your chance to learn the walk of the ancients, to bring into your life an energy of healing, tranformation, and consciousness. Oh Shinnah is a true Warrior Woman and has been teaching for many years, allowing herself to follow her path of touching others with the beauty that is truth. I have been touched...by the beauty, by the authenticity, and by the professionalism that was put into making this video, the first of a series.

3479164,5,B001B187EI,"Watching this DVD can be the first step to changing your life. Live in harmony with the Mother Earth and renew your connection with her. These sacred traditions and rituals can easily be incorporated into your everyday life. I have studied with Oh Shinnah and Deep Arrow Woman and feel honored and blessed to know them because of their warmth, authenticity and wisdom. So grateful that this DVD will help to keep these traditions alive. Watch All is Made Beautiful with an open mind, more important watch it with an open heart.",1281484800,3,527,4.739130434782608
3479165,5,B001B187EI,This video gives a glimpse into the life teachings of a gifted Apache elder who had the vision and compassion to carry these teachings to the world. They say you can judge a teacher by her students and Oh Shinnah's students are the real deal. From simple daily ritual practice to the transformational healing of the Journey of the Waters the video is worth checking out. The Journey begins here.,1281484800,7,395,4.6571428571428575
3479166,5,B001B187EI,"I've watched this DVD dozens of times and have worked with Oh Shinnah for over 25 years. She calls me Deep Arrow Woman and taught me to facilitate the Journey of the Waters with her. I love All is Made Beautiful, and show it to all my friends, family and students. My entire Moonfire Meeeting House Community, of which Oh Shinnah is an esteemed elder, has learned so much from watching this DVD.
It's beautifully photographed and skillfully produced,and the concepts presented are made very easy to understand.  It has a particular point of view and is filled with powerful information that archives the life's work of this wonderful and internationally renowned women, Oh Shinnah Fast Wolf.  Also, as a former Science teacher, I appreciate the scientific research that was also included in this DVD to back up some of the teachings shared - like the smudging ritual.
Anyone with half a brain would know that this DVD reflects  AUTHENTIC spiritual teachings from First Nations People, guardians of our Earth Mother.  If people began each day with the Morning Prayers found in this DVD, ALL COULD BE MADE BEAUTIFUL.  Kadeeshte!",1281484800,12,1126,4.905263157894737
3479167,5,B001B187EI,"There is absolutely no HYPE HERE!  This DVD opens the door to healing and personal power.  I know because I experienced a complete deliverance from a full blown clinical and psychological depression by listening, learning and most importantly - doing what O'Shinnah teaches!  The Journey of the Waters which O'Shinnah references on this DVD is a spectacular journey back to the Self.  It is an honest look in the mirror that helps a person ground and regain their footing.  A beginner's step into personal power.  O'Shinnah speaks from her heart.  She is the most authentic healer that I have ever met.  Just saying morning prayers in the method that O'Shinnah teaches on this DVD will change a person's life for the better.  This DVD a beginning for people who are searching for honest healing.  AWESOME DVD!!!!  Purchase it and start getting your life back!",1281484800,8,859,4.895833333333333
3479168,5,B001B187EI,"This is an amazing video of Oh Shinnah Fast Wolf, teacher and elder of Native American traditions.  Using her techniques and listening to her teachings has opened my mind and heart to the beauty and harmony of the earth and of our relationship with her.  For those who are seekers on the earth, Oh Shinnah will widen your horizons and deepen your spiritual practices and understandings.",1281484800,2,386,4.833333333333333
3479169,4,B001B187EI,"I have the CD and it is beautiful! She is a carrier of Beauty and has touched my life deeply. This video includes a simple and beautiful taste of the teachings. I love that she always told us to not take her word for anything- she asked us to always try it ourselves and see for ourselves how these tools work.
My favorite quote of hers is ""The only thing I have to give is how I live my life.""",1281484800,5,394,3.9375

8281208,1,B001B187EI,"Hogwash. This woman is a known fake who stole the name of a well known Lakota family. She is variously credited as Cheyenne, Hopi, Apache, and Cherokee all over the internet. I'm sickened to see many of my Facebook friends quoting her. And I'm sickened to know that she is harming a good family from the community that brought Standing Rock to the world. White woman, take off your native regalia and stop appropriating the culture of others. If you want to teach what your helping spirits have taught you, do it as Penny McKelvey. Then maybe there would be some value in what you're saying.",1495584000,,591,4.584905660377358
8281209,5,B001B187EI,"I went on the Journey of the Waters in 1999 led by OhShinah,Deep Arrow and Bright Owl,after having met Deep Arrow in the early 90s. It is authentic. I have been doing the morning prayers and evening prayers for well over twenty years. I also attended Deep Arrows Mystery School for four years and celebrate all the Solstice and Equinox days with this community. The person who wrote the nasty review doesn't sound very Spiritual to me. I walk in Beauty every day,and pray gratitude for my teachers and initiations.",1456531200,,514,4.722222222222222
8281210,4,B001B187EI,I bought this as a gift for my bf who was happy to even have a used disc which has never been an issue before.  Unfortunately this disc began to skip. Fortunately my bf doesn't mind as he was happy to have a copy of his own.,1434240000,,224,3.765957446808511
8281211,2,B001B187EI,"The only thing good about this is her comments about caring for the environment.  HOWEVER, the moment she started talking about ""north facing"" & crystals I knew there was something wrong, so I checked further.  Penny McKelvey  has not been adopted by a Native American tribe and should not claim to be anything other than who she is.  The issue of cultural appropriation, especially of Native American culture, cannot be understood by those outside of the community.  It is one thing to follow the Red Road, but a very different thing to falsely claim heritage and use that to sell yourself.  That is called fraud.  It is very painful for Native American people to see their culture's symbols or other cultural elements being used in a lie.  By the way, it is illegal to own an eagle feather unless you are a registered member of a federally recognized tribe.  For that you need a blood quantum.  Do not purchase this DVD.",1424476800,,922,4.670807453416149
8281212,5,B001B187EI,A wonder dvd telling us much about the Native American ways and the life of this wonderful woman.,1415577600,,97,4.444444444444445
8281213,2,B001B187EI,"I purchased this DVD with an open mind as I am always open to learning about native american teachings.  First, Ms Fastwolf does not look native american to me at all.  She is whiter than I am and I come from Scandinavian peoples.  After looking her up on google come to find out that she is really Penny McKelvey and apparently no native american group will claim her.  I have no problem if she is white and passing on some native american processes for edification, but the fact that she isn't what she claims to be contaminates her message for me.  Another wise woman, Evelyn Eaton (I Send A Voice) is white and has no pretensions to be otherwise.  She is someone I can learn from when I heard her speak a number of years ago.  Watching the DVD I didn't get that 'heart sense' that comes from being around genuine native americans.  It felt flat and trivial, teachings that could have been gleaned from anywhere.  If you are a sincere seeker of native american ways I can't recommend this video. The two stars are for the reminder to pray over my food.",1411603200,3,1055,4.424870466321243

If you need a shot of self esteem and some
Beautiful scenery, this is good for you.

I've watched it a few times since purchasing.
I even bought one for my mother, she loves it!",1311292800,,204,4.1
8281216,1,B001B187EI,"I bought and reviewed this video and there is nothing Native American about this production.  At various times in her life this woman was Lakota, Apache, Mohawk, and while the Fast Wolf name is Lakota, she is not.  She is not an elder of any tribe, the Apache did not do the water ceremony, all this came out of her own head and not from any legitimate Indian nation.  A series of articles about this fake elder and medicine woman came out in Indian Country a few years ago.  Researchers were unable to find a single connection from this woman to any American Indian tribe.  She is of Scottish and English ancestry and has no documented connection to Indians beyond the visions in her head.  Do not waste your money on this trash.",1309737600,15,730,4.451127819548872
