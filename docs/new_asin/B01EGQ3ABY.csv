7735056,5,B01EGQ3ABY,"""Kiss Me, Kill Me"" is a murder mystery told at its best. It is a story that sends you in many directions guessing until the end. Just when I thought I had it figured out...I was wrong. It happened again...and then a third time. Credit screenwriter David Michael Barrett as the plot twists were plentiful in this edge- of-your-seat, didn't-see-that-coming, mystery. I was pulled in and never released until the final few minutes. I love a good thriller, and this film was quite adequate in keeping this seasoned viewer guessing. Bonus points for the very Hitchcockian cameo from the talented director, Casper Andreas!

This film was visually very stunning. It's use of color and composition was extremely beautiful. I enjoyed the pacing of this film as well. Edited in such a way that you stayed on your toes as you watched the film towards the end.

The opening credits montage, for example was reminiscent of mysteries that had a more comedic bent but this was effective and exciting as it played out. As the film progressed it moved from one crazy night to its crazy days of confusion and character play. It seemed obvious to the viewer that Dusty was not the killer but as the visuals unfolded that became a question again in everyone's mind. Adding to the movement visually and in the story line you have the development of the characters.

They hypnotist was one of the steady rocks throughout the film, everyone else seemed to add to the layered plot of whom killed whom. But the writer and director did an excellent job by giving the viewer just enough to keep us questioning every twist and turn that entered the picture. Believability is important to any film and the casting of this film was well done. Especially the lead character Dusty. He had to experience so much as the film moved forward. I think the most emotional and impactful scene was his final session being hypnotized when he was able to uncover the truth of what he had done, even if it were accidental.

This film was extremely well put together. From the visuals to the music straight through to the story line. Audiences may find similarities to other films but that can't be helped in any ""Who done It?"" mystery. What audiences will connect to are the characters, the occasional humor and the final twist in the end. Will there now be a spin off to tie it all together in another crazy way?

Unlike traditional film noir, the film portrays gay and transgender characters, and does so in a modern, nuanced way. The gay characters are not solely motivated by sex, they are driven by grief, love and loss of a spouse. The film also depicts the circle of gay and lesbian friends that is more than just a stereotypical depiction. Further, the film shows us a drag queen take off her makeup and show a male side, in an un-self conscious way. This kind of scene is rare in cinema. Strong acting performances by all the main actors are also key in keeping it a serious genre film. Use of music, dark lighting and mood all work to strong effect.

But the film doesn't take itself too seriously either. For example, the crystal tiger that shows up in various scenes, and plays a key role in the denouement, evokes a 70's disco-meets-kung-fu movie aesthetic. Also, the repeated jokes about lesbians throughout, and the coming out of the place detective at the end of the film show that this film has a sense of humor. Just the premise of a gay murder mystery, with a drag queen and baby-crazed woman as key supporting characters could easily sunk to ""Showgirls""-level camp, which thankfully, it didn't.

I recommend this film because it is suspenseful, has a sense of humor and portrays gay and trans-gendered characters in a realistic way, as it updates the film noir genre and re-imagines the traditional murder mystery for a new generation of viewer.",1480377600,14,3821,4.6855439642324885
7735057,1,B01EGQ3ABY,"I thought I'd just let everyone know, that this is actually a copy of a film called Baba Yaga (1972), directed by Corrado Farina, and while it does star Caroll Baker, Umberto Lenzi, Erika Blanc and Jean Louis Trintignant are nowhere to be found.  There is a release of Baba Yaga available through Blue Underground which I would recommend over this version.

 The film Kiss Me Kill Me is the American title of  Cos Dolce... Cos Perversa (1969) directed by Umberto Lenzi, a film I've not seen, but have been interested in finding ever since happening upon a CD of the beautiful Riz Otorlani score.

An amusing side note here is that I'm not even sure that this is the soundtrack to Cos Dolce... Cos Perversa, as I recently saw Lenzi's Seven Bloodstained Orchids (Sette Orchidee Macchiate Di Rosso-1972) which featured most of the same music on this CD.  Lenzi might have simply reused Ortolani's score from a film he had made three years earlier, or perhaps the CD I purchased was mislabeled...much in the same manner as the Kiss Me Kill Me DVD.  Curious.

The confusing packaging offers the proper credits for Cos Dolce..., but is illustrated with still images from Baba Yaga.  My guess is that the distributor is unaware of their error, and that the common denominator of Caroll Baker resulted in the confusion.

This DVD is released by Miracle Pictures.  ""If it's the film you asked for...it's a Miracle.""",1115164800,8,1406,4.744855967078189

It was good until the last quarter when all went to hell quicker than you can say West Hollywood.
Although all characters acted inconsistently it was pretty decent until the director (or the scriptwriters) decided to make it more convoluted than it already was with twenty final twists. The female cop was the worst cliche ever, and there's is no logic in try to feed us good/bad cop skit when we have reruns of Law & Order up to our eyebrows everywhere. And if I ever see people walking in and out of crimes scenes like they did in this movie in real life I'll lose the little faith I still have in the system because it was ridiculous.
The lead did everything he could to seem guilty and more.
In all honesty, I continued watching it after the 3/4 just to see how they were going to wrap up the mess they've created at that point (even the music tried to be film noir and it was annoying).
But I'm going to give it kudos for the money they spent and the pretty boys.

Van, Gale and the actor who plays the psychologist are all fine actors, but the script isn't sharp and witty enough to pull off this type of schtick. It isn't even in the genre of the B movie thrillers of the 30's and 40's, which may have been the writer's intent, and here is where the direction is at fault. The photography could have helped establish the atmosphere of a film noir, but the lighting is all wrong for that. Even so, if it ain't on the page, it won't be on the screen. No, this is a failure all around. I get what was attempted, but it just does not work. I wouldn't waste time on this one, though it was good to see Gale Harrold.

7735087,5,B01EGQ3ABY,"has finished watching ""Kiss Me Kill Me"" released by EMBREM.
I first learned of Casper Andreas latest movie, ""Kiss Me Kill Me"" when I received a notification from Kickstarter that it would be a project that I might be interested in backing, which I did.
Written by David Michael Barrett and directed by Casper Andreas, ""Kiss Me Kill Me"" is a stylistic thriller that pays homage to the best elements of the late Alfred Hitchcock, while being unafraid to take a look at the gritty underbelly of the West Hollywood community - as Andreas has previously done with ""Going Down in La-La Land.""
During their anniversary/engagement party, Dush learns that his soon-to-be husband Stephen has not only been cheating on him with Craigory = Stephen's ex - but that Stephen, who creates and produces reality television shows, has decided to make Craigory the star of his latest project, casting aside Dusty.
Angered and dismayed over what should have been one of the most happiest days of his life, Dusty walks out of the party and down to The Pink Dot - a liquor store - to drown out his sorrows in high priced tequila.
Only Dusty comes to in the hospital.  Stephen is dead, killed in a robbery at the liquor store and he is suspect number one.
As Dusty quickly learns, all his friends have been hiding secrets about Stephen, and one of those friends not only wanted Stephen dead, but wants Dusty to go to prison for Stephen's murder, and if that can't be arranged by fake evidence, then they want Dusty to join Stephen in the afterlife.
Though minor characters, Detectives Riley and Santos deserve their own movie.
An engrossing thriller with a stunning twist at the end  - I certainly didn't see it coming.
Strongly Recommended!

shows (such as 'Law & Order') being made today that are far superior to this.  The acting performances aren't exactly 'atrocious' but they just aren't convincing enough - thus, one never feels that the characters are true-to-life because we aren't sufficiently moved by some rather wooden depictions.

With echoes of Chinatown and Fear in the Night (an early 40s movie with DeForest Kelley of Star Trek fame), we have a murder mystery that includes flashbacks, hypnotism, possessive love, love denied, jealously, drug addiction, and an array of suspects (No Spoilers Here). Think Bogart, Greenstreet, Astor, Stanwyck, Lizabeth Scott, Zachary Scott, et.al on steroids. This is not the cerebral film noir of yesteryear but is more akin to some of the action scenes one witnesses in Ruthless or Mildred Pierce.

7735106,2,B01EGQ3ABY,"""Kiss Me Kill Me"" was a hot mess. Even the title is goofy. I was expecting something better with Gale Harold as one of the actors. The plot had potential but it was weighed down by an awkward screenplay, stilted acting and ridiculous suppositions. I couldn't tell if the frequent injections of promiscuous gay sex were intended as a plot point or a stereotype. The technical portrayals of police work were laughable and would never happen in real life. This movie reminded me of a skit by a gay theater group in a Sunday night drag bar, complete with divas, overacting and puffed up ""stars"" not even remotely ready for their closeup. I don't understand how a cast, many of whom with notable and mainstream work in their bios, could have turned out such a juvenile production. The description of this ""feature film"" as a ""neo-noir psychological thriller"" is so over the top that I'm surprised that Alfred Hitchcock himself hasn't risen from his grave, invented a time machine and traveled to the future and back to stop this farce from being billed as an example of the ""neo-noir psychological thriller"" genre. Now that I'm done with the ""T"" and the shade, I will say that I did enjoy a few of the characters. Jackie Monahan and Allison Lane as the snarky lesbian couple Danielle and Lori handled their limited dialogue and character portrayals well. Ru Paul's Drag Race ""Shangela"" (credited as D. J. Pierce) as the drag queen hypnotist / DJ was quite engaging and comfortable in front of the camera. You will get the most bang for your $3.99 spent on this movie by gathering with a group of friends and having your own snarkfest of witty repartee with wine-in-a-box and a cheese ball. If you make it that far, stick around for the last scene with Brianna Brown as Amanda, the unstable lawyer. Trust me, you won't forget it.",1481500800,4,1823,4.6645962732919255
