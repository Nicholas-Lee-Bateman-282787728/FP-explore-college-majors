4836914,5,B005MTHRG4,Throughout the entire movie I could not stop laughing. Mathew Lillard is still as funny as ever and Tom Arnold's cameo was hilarious! If you want a great comedy to laugh non stop and lift your spirits this will do the trick!,1326758400,,224,4.357142857142857
4836915,4,B005MTHRG4,"""If you need anything you call your cousin Roger and I'll hook you up. I never would have said that if I thought he was gonna take me seriously."" After graduating from high school Alex needs help with his scholarship. When is internship goes bad he calls his cousin Roger (Lillard) for help. When Roger's job turns out to be less then advertised he is unsure of what to do, then he meets Laura (LeFevre) and they all come up with an idea. Everyonce in a while I enjoy the occasional low-brow comedy. This one is very comparable to ""Girl Next Door"" in the subject matter. This one involves the kids making money by opening a brothel instead of a porn movie. The cast is actually comprised of some pretty big names and is entertaining and funny throughout. When you watch don't expect an Oscar type movie, but this is actually one of the funnier ""boobie"" movies that have come out in awhile. Overall, a funny and entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. I give it a B (for boobies...ha ha)

*Also try - Chick Magnet & Finding Bliss",1320710400,2,1034,4.385416666666667
4836916,5,B005MTHRG4,"The movie was hilarious..a total riot!!  It has a great cast of comedy actors, (Mathew Lillard, Efren Ramirez, Tom Arnold, Brett Davern....). its definately a cult classic in the making!!  For the guys there are plenty of gratuitous sexy girls, Rachelle Lefevre and Sheena Lee make a splash in this comedy classic!!
I saw it on PPV also, this was one of my favorite comedies this year!",1318204800,,385,4.731343283582089
4836917,4,B005MTHRG4,"I heard there is a release date for this film for Sept. 30, 2011, but I had a chance to see it at a screening already.  I will admit I went with much trepidation, but by the time the film was done, I had a good time for two hours.  This is definitely a genre film, in the vein of ANIMAL HOUSE, RISKY BUSINESS, and AMERICAN PIE, and even some NIGHT SHIFT, thrown in.  But every film falls into some kind of story structure, and POOL BOYS is no different.

This film is good-natured and is meant to be a feel-good film.  Matthew Lillard and Rachelle Lefevre are quite good, actually making you care about their characters, and John Billingsley is a hoot as the Dean everyone wished they had.  The party that wraps things up, is hilarious and worth the price of admission.

This film is what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything more, and it succeeds admirably.  The film is never mean or hateful to its own characters.  Enjoyable.",1316390400,5,932,4.341040462427745
8479758,4,B005MTHRG4,Funny and raunchy. There is nudity in this film. Tom Arnold is great as the crazy guy and Matthew Lillard is great in it too. I loved him in his comedies. What happened to him? He needs to get back into doing comedies.,1510790400,,218,4.093023255813954

8479761,4,B005MTHRG4,"Just a lot of fun. We have Matthew Lillard who lies to his family about his employment, they believe he is a big shot and instead he is a Poolboy. Brett Davern is his cousin who was going to intern for a senator and that falls through so Harvard falls through and he goes to get a job with his successful cousin and, uh oh, he finds out. What happens after is a kind of modern ""Risky Business"" They begin a brothel in a pool clients house while they are away. Lots of good laughs and we have Tom Arnold to boot! he is very funny too.",1424304000,,533,3.9906542056074765
8479762,2,B005MTHRG4,"This is another Risky Business type movie. Two cousins end up at a mansion belonging to someone else, running an escort service. Young naive Alex (Brett Davern) has a crush on one of the escorts, Laura (Rachelle Lefevre) who claims most of her clients don't want sex. Matthew Lillard plays Roger the underachieving cousin. Tom Arnold plays himself. George Takei (Sulu) has managed to score himself a role as a gay. The plot was predictable, characters shallow, and humor light. If you are having a bad movies by National Lampoon film festival, you could sneak this one in and no one could tell the difference.

F-bomb, sexual references, silicon nudity (Simona Fusco, Jennifer Walcott, sign language girl)",1333324800,2,705,5.0256410256410255

8479766,5,B005MTHRG4,"I thought this movie was awesome, from a college kids standpoint, i would love to do that for the summer. Movie was fun, entertaining and wild! IMPORTANT: Movie has no redeeming value, watch if your a fan of the American Pie Series, very similar comic element. but in my opinion i loved it!",1328054400,,290,4.490566037735849
8479767,4,B005MTHRG4,Just bought the DVD on Amazon and absolutely LOVED it! definitely one of the funniest movies i've seen in a while. All I want to do now is go eat at Olive Garden! hahaha. Rochelle is breathtakingly gorgeous and Brett Davern and Matthew Lillard are quite the dynamic duo! Can't wait to see more of Brett in MTVs Awkward now!,1326931200,,323,4.4
