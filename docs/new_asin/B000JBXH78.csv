2667862,4,B000JBXH78,"I saw this movie while staying in Mexico and it is a stunning, eye-opening look into the class differences in Mexico City.  Most American (United States) looks into Mexico involve dusty border towns and sombrero-laiden stereotypes.  This shows you another side of Mexico:  class differences in one of the largest cities on earth.  After 6 weeks in Mexico, much of it in Mexico City, I have a new view of life and of the world.

This movie is worth a watch.  If you're not fluent in Spanish (I speak it, but I'm not fluent), you will want to use the subtitles, because it's full of slang and cussing in Spanish that would be impossible for a school-educated Spanish-speaker to get a grip of on the first watch.",1221609600,4,709,4.543307086614173
2667863,5,B000JBXH78,"This movie is a great adaptation. It has everything the classic romeo&Juliet story has- drama and tragedy! lol. The characters wer believable and the movie made you want them to end up together in the end. But of course, not possible.",1221350400,,234,4.7317073170731705

2667865,5,B000JBXH78,"I was very pleased with this film, latin originated films have been improving in all spects,

it is also a beautiful story and they made an exellent job in casting for every character.

This film makes you feel involved in the story.

This is a beautiful film that I will always remember and I'm thankfull that Amazon helped me find

this movie here in the U.S. because I coudn't find it anywhere in the U.S.

P.S. please provide more latin films.  Thank you.",1178582400,3,459,4.469879518072289
2667866,4,B000JBXH78,"I enjoyed this. It's a reminder of how classic the premise of Romeo and Juliet really is, but it's always nice to see the story cast in new and innovative ways. This film does that. Martha Higareda is lovely as Renata, and in general Fernando Sariana does a great job of getting the most out of his young actors. For American viewers this will also have the refreshing complexity of recent Mexican film in that it shows the class frictions and prejudices.

I did think the ending played out a little to conveniently tragic. It's not exactly as the original, of course. That ending might have been too elaborate to get into this story realistically. Instead the director goes for a gritty, believable sort of realism.",1175299200,7,716,4.682539682539683
2667867,5,B000JBXH78,It is the best Romo & Juliet movie ever. I can watch it over and over and over again and not get sick of it. Evertime I watch I cry. I just shows that when two people love each other they will do whatever they have to do to be together.,1172793600,,236,3.6470588235294117
2667868,5,B000JBXH78,"This is one of the most powerful, tender, and well-acted films of forbidden love I have ever seen with an amazing cast with a beautifully interwoven soundtrack of the best Spanish rock bands in Mexico.  I bought the DVD in Mexico in '02 just a year after its theatrical release without having seen it.  I only asked about it since I was seeing posters all over the city.

I was glad that I bought it and showed it to my Spanish students.  The result was nothing but tears and amazement at a beautifully told story of an impossible love because of an extreme difference in class.  A teenage boy from a humble upper low class family falls in love with a upper class teenage girl; a love that is frowned upon in reality in actual Mexico City, where the story takes place.

Be ready to feel for the characters, understand the societal structure, and sense the frustration that the two main characters face while they struggle to be together for love.  An amazing film for being a teenage love story...  This was truly an Oscar-worthy film!",1167004800,20,1035,4.526881720430108

2667910,4,B000JBXH78,"This movie is much more than a teenage love story ala Romeo and Juliet. The storyline about two teenagers who fall in love despite all the obstacles is well told. The story of Renata, the well-to-do fair skinned beauty, played to the tee by the lovely Martha Higareda and the boy from the other side of the tracks, dark skinned artist Ulises,played by Luis Fernando Pena is a love story that must overcome racism, social barriers and gain acceptance against all odds. There is also a good performance by the multi-talented, singer and actress, Ximena Sarinana, who plays the brat, younger sister of Renata, who is constantly trying to tell her older sister to leave Ulises alone as she sides with her parents. She has her own issues that she should be more concerned with.

The cinematography is fast paced ,very artistic camera work MTV-style, with transitions from black and white to color and saturated color frames; the split frame within a frame is eye candy for the viewer. Technically it is a very modern, unconventional style that is very pleasing. The soundtrack is amazing featuring many artists including the young songbird Ximena Sabrina, who also happens to be the daughter of the director Fernando Sabrina. This is a movie that delights on every level;intelectually,visually and aurally. Although fun to watch, the movie proves to be much more as the questions raised about Mexican culture and the differences within society permeates throughout the movie and begs for answers. Somehow you just know it is not going to be a happpy ending. True to Romeo and Juliet form it ends in a tradegy. If you want to be entertained than check out this movie if you haven't seen it before, if not watch it again because it is that good. Highly recommended for all, especailly the young at heart.",1360627200,2,1797,4.834415584415584

2667917,4,B000JBXH78,"As moviegoers, we've been beaten over the head with the Romeo and Juliet adaptations.  What makes Amar Te Duele stand out is director Fernando Sariana's decision to emphasize the differences between the socioeconomic strata of Mexico.

The majority of mainstream Mexican movies fail to touch on the rift that can exist between Nacos and Fresas.  The closest equivalent in English that you can probably find to ""Naco"" is ""White Trash"", a Mexican that is considered by others to be lower-class or unrefined.  To the contrary, Fresas are what you might consider the Mexican equivalent of ""Preppy"" individuals.  These expressions are used lightly in movies such as ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" to help polarize the lead characters, and show the influence it has on their relationship.  Amar Te Duele is a breath of fresh air in that it delves deeper into the Naco/Fresa class differences that exist in Mexico, but rarely make it to American cinema.

While the plot itself isn't incredibly original, the movie is made enjoyable thanks to a warm performance by the very beautiful Martha Higareda.  Higareda does a great job, despite this being her film debut, having only previously appeared in a handful of soap operas on Mexican television.

Amar Te Duele is not a top-notch example of Mexican filmmaking, but it is certainly a DVD that you will want to own.",1263427200,4,1345,4.942222222222222

The sad thing is this still happens, and it's unfortunate that parents would not approve of someone who is not in the same social class as they are.  A sad story, surprise ending, but a well told story nevertheless.  Really enjoyed it and will be keeping it in my library to watch again.",1488240000,,437,4.240963855421687
