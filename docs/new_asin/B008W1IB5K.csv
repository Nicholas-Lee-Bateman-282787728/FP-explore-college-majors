5186429,5,B008W1IB5K,"I gave this movie a good rateing because

movie was good, item was as described when received. good story line as well.",1364601600,2,119,4.409090909090909
5186430,2,B008W1IB5K,"The film consists of a ""Dead TV"" group who operate a Haunted Hotel, one with an evil history. The script centers around June (Nicole Cinaglia) a young lady who is a ""psychic beacon."" The basic idea, which was not well developed, is that satan(?) of some evil desires to leave hell. This is done in a six step or six degree process which requires killing individuals close to June.

Part of the picture consists of a psychic who is called in to investigate what had happened. It gave zero contribution to the film other than set up for a sequel. The execution of the Horror Hotel itself I enjoyed. The special effects were decent. The dialouge needed improvement. The film seemed to have either been poorly written, directed, or died on the editing floor as it didn't come together the way a horror film should come together, i.e. it had good scenes, they just didn't tie them together properly to hold our interest.

5186431,1,B008W1IB5K,"First let me say that I'm a big Horror movie fan, and this my friends was just plain embarrassing!!  Corey Feldman was terrible, I think that all those years of partying have fogged his ability to even halfass act!! This was NO LOST BOYS!! This movie jumped around way too much, and the acting in general sucked! The only thing about this movie that was entertaining was that it was so corny it made you have to laugh at times. So, don't waste your time or money.",1360972800,3,463,4.32183908045977
5186432,1,B008W1IB5K,"Listen to the negative reviews. The positive reviews sound like they came from the people who made this.  I tend to love a low budget movie, but I don't know what they spent ANY of their money on. I have to wonder if any of the actors (besides Feldman who is in this movie for about 2 minutes) or crew were paid?  The acting was AWFUL, go to your local high school if you want to see better acting.

There is zero gore or horror in this, which is okay, but there isn't a story either and the characters suck. It's hard to say that a horror movie was boring, but this was. I can't say a whole lot more without giving anything away, but I will just say that nothing interesting happens in this movie, and there isn't an ending in it either.  I just really hope they don't make a sequel.

Things belong in the 80s for a reason.  This movie doesn't belong in the 80s though, it belongs in the trash can. And who cares about haunted houses anyway?",1360886400,2,942,4.148351648351649
5186433,1,B008W1IB5K,"My GF asked for this to add to her Corey Feldman collection because we are from the Poconos area. We almost turned it off after 10 minutes, but finished it after we went through the hassle of paying the $10 for this. First off, Corey Feldman isn't in this movie for more than 5 minutes. For the other 85 minutes, you watch a bunch of people run around who I have never heard of before, and I don't expect any of them will be making names for themselves in this lifetime. An utter waste of your time and money. I complained to Amazon about how LOW QUALITY this DVD was, and they are luckily allowing me to return it for a full refund. THANK YOU AMAZON. Corey Feldman is clearly looking for paychecks, and is a LONG WAY from his glory days.
Regarding this movie: the acting is TERRIBLE, the lighting is TERRIBLE, the FX work is TERRIBLE (I assume they bought the blood at WalMart), the cinematography is TERRIBLE, the editing is TERRIBLE, and the script is TERRIBLE. I cannot say a single positive thing about this entire movie, and if I could give it zero stars, I really would.
YOU DO NOT WANT TO BUY THIS MOVIE. I assume any positive review is coming from one of the actors or crew members who have absolutely NO idea how a movie should be made. They only made this for $100,000. Blah. Blah. Blah. I can think of SO MANY BETTER things to do with that kind of money, and this movie makes the Hotel of Horror look like an extremely boring place (warehouse?) which I won't be visiting any time soon.
You couldn't pay me to watch this movie again.",1360800000,4,1544,4.309278350515464
5186434,5,B008W1IB5K,Joe Raffa is an amazing director! He is also a great editor! Joe Raffa did a fantastic job acting in this movie as well!,1356998400,2,120,4.041666666666667
5186435,5,B008W1IB5K,"my son has every movie corey feldman ever made, he has a great collection. he loved the movie, i thought it was kind of hard to follow",1356739200,2,134,4.0
5186436,5,B008W1IB5K,It was good and if want to see what the lake house is this will show you. I like it becuse of the history of the lake house.,1356393600,3,124,3.4642857142857144
5186437,5,B008W1IB5K,"Great Movie, I watched it three times already and just ordered the bluray version.  I found it to be very well acted and the picture quality is great. it has a great plot that is very original and it has a feel as if it could really happen to you! the haunted hotel scenes were the best, the gore and effects are great, im hoping they are working on a part 2 because the end definately leaves you wondering!!!",1355529600,2,409,4.177215189873418
5186438,3,B008W1IB5K,"SIX DEGREES OF HELL is a rather perverse twist on the six degrees of separation theory.  Writer/director/co-star Joe Raffa weaves a tale of ghostly possession and psychobabble focusing on young June and the psychic forces she is destined to release upon the world.
A clever premise falters at times, with incoherent plotholes and reckless sound editing.  The performances are on a community theatre level.  Some of the make-up effects are good but due to its obviously limited budget, there are some laughable ones, too.  Some of the blood looks like tomato juice.
The presence of Corey Feldman as a punkish paranormal investigator adds little more than a vehicle for narrative exposition.  The final scene seems an indication of a potential sequel.
SIX DEGREES is entertaining in a sleazy way and rental would be wiser than purchasing.  One viewing should be enough.",1354147200,7,867,5.113475177304965
8531311,5,B008W1IB5K,"This is a great horror movie. The way the end came together, filling in all the gaps and tying up the story was so well done. I thought the acting was good, the editing - which is a lot harder than people may realize - is superb. The photography and camera work is also good. I saw a lot of criticism for the movie on here which I really don't understand. I love horror with a real storyline, that you have to pay attention to, and this film meets that criteria. Don't listen to people that enjoy ripping others apart. Give the movie a chance instead.",1527120000,,551,4.2075471698113205
8531312,2,B008W1IB5K,"A confusing mess of a movie. Way too many plot ideas and characters. Not a good script. Corey Feldman is top-billed actor only because he is the only one with any name recognition. But, he has little screen time and is totally extraneous to the film. Seems like  he was added in as an after-thought to get some marketing power for the film. He does not interact with any other actors, except for one. I can't describe the plot to you, because it is too convoluted. It really is a terrible film, but I will say that the concept of having most of its action take place in a ""haunted house"" halloween attraction has merit, and the make-up for the haunted house play-actors was very good. A few of the special effects were good. But, in general, don't feel that you missed out on anything if you don't see this film. It does have promise as a concept if someone with talent and a budget were to take the idea and re-make it in nice understandable plot/format. So, only for that reason d I not give it 1 star. There are some extras on the dvd, but I was too uninterested to watch any.",1495324800,,1079,4.28921568627451
8531313,5,B008W1IB5K,This movie was just silly fun. Set in a real life Haunted Attraction. Some extras were actual workers in that attraction. I love Corey Feldman and as usual he plays a very quarky character. I loved this film for what it is good silly fun.,1474243200,,238,4.311111111111111
8531314,1,B008W1IB5K,"Incoherent plot, bad acting, and bad writing all around.  I don't pretend to understand why anyone would give this movie a 5 star review unless they had a gun to their head, but they were ALL lying.

Don't even pirate this movie.  You can't get those minutes of your life back.",1464134400,,277,4.392156862745098
8531315,4,B008W1IB5K,"This is a fun movie to watch because of all the influences from classic horror! 6 Degrees of Hell has a deep and involved possession story line that was nice to see in a modern horror movie. It's great to see Corey Feldman again, a very underrated actor. This film is a treat for any serious true fan of horror.",1442966400,,311,4.2

8531320,5,B008W1IB5K,6 Degrees of hell was filmed in the hotel of horrors better known as the lake house now a lot of people didn't like this movie i mean i know it's not a big horror movie like the lost boys now Corey Feldman played in there but you have to think about it this is a low budget film and that's why he wasn't in the movie that much now but at the end Corey is walking up to the lake house which means they might make a sequel to it but the movie didn't do to good but Joe please make a sequel i liked the film i mean it was filmed up in kunkletown. pa about right where i used to live.,1395187200,,580,3.685483870967742
