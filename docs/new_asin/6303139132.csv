Being head of a fencing team from a major university, it's hard to impress me in that aspect, but the film was remarkable.  Beyond the fencing, Abraham delivers an excellent role, making this movie worth-while to fencers and non-fencers alike.
There is a cheesy side plot of two fencers falling in love and while it does detract some from the movie, it merely serves to offer the viewer a break from the intensity of the movie.
Overall, it was a fanstastically directed film, the cinematography on the final fight scene just added to the overall effect of the film.",1063152000,8,651,4.603448275862069
580694,4,6303139132,"On the whole, this movie is very good, with a few minor problems. The movie presents us with a very interesting hero, an ex convict ( F. Murray Abraham) who is returning into the world, coming back to the fencing school where he studied. He comes back to meet the son of his long time protoge played by Eric Roberts. F. Murray Abraham plays a very convincing main role, as the dark, sullen swordsman Max Suba as is Eric Roberts in the part of the protege's son who is obcessed by excellence. This movie also offers an interesting look into the world of fencing and offers a explosive, can't be beat duel at the end between Eric Roberts and F. Murray Abraham, which makes the viewer wonder just how long it took them to fight as good as they do! The one thing that broght this movie down, although it was quite minor was the side story of two young fencing students who fall in love, this subplot is plauged with bad, cliched diologe that makes me want to fast foward to the fencing, but all in all, it does not subtract  from the complete value of the movie. I would give this movie four stars for it being almost perfect.",1059004800,10,1122,4.317535545023697

580698,4,6303139132,"This is not a movie about fencing. It is merely using the setting of a fencing academy to explore human nature, particularly obsession with excellence.
Jeremy Kagan, an otherwise unremarkable director, weaves  these themes into an engaging story with some terrific cinematography. In  particular, many of the fencing scenes involving Roberts are downright  gorgeous. Is the fencing accurate? I have no idea; I've heard both opinions  offered, but it scarcely matters.
F. Murray Abraham is as excellent as  always.  His path through the movie is mirrored not only by his physical  health but by the appearance of his apartment, his relationships with  others, etc., and Abraham is utterly convincing.
Eric Roberts turns in a  very good performance, surprisingly.  He's got a natural tendency to really  play over the top, but for the most part he avoids that here.  He's uneven  in a couple of scenes, particularly the end, but that's only a minor  quibble.

At the core of this story is Garron's struggle to remain faithful to his family and to his God even when circumstances leave no obvious way to do so.

 There were no film industry professionals involved in this production. That's something you'll recognize but it really only adds to the film's charm. Even so, the production is high quality.

580842,4,6303139132,"Hard to believe that Eric Roberts has now been in the business for nearly 40 years. Today the perennial bad guy character actor, he never quite reached the level of stardom equal to that of his talent. Though one could reasonably argue that that was indeed the level he was capable of in the first place. I'm torn on the subject as his performances tend to swing from fantastic (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runaway-Train/dp/0792838424/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runaway Train</a>) to functional (pretty much everything else).

This very solid film falls into the former and, perhaps, represents his best career performance to date.

Roberts portrays Alexander Villard, fencing master. Undefeated in his career, he holds the distinction of being a two-time Olympic Gold Medalist and two-time World Champion - doubling the achievement of his illustrious late father. A father who died under the most unusual of circumstances. Still, in spite of its historical notoriety, the Villard Academy remains one of the country's most prestigious and desirable schools. And students who are selected to attend are chosen by two simple criteria - raw talent or the ability to pay.

Enter F. Murray Abraham as Maximillian 'Max' Suba, recent resident of the justice system. Now free after two decades, he's a man looking for a job. But not just any job. He wants to be a fencing instructor - specifically at the Villard Academy.

Why?

As the past comes crashing back into their lives, the two men are on a collision course at the points of their pe. Those are rapiers, not foils - pe are killing swords. And the only resolution either will find is by way of blood.

Once again, this same vehicle showcases two rich, superlative, and deeply complex performances by a pair of character actors whose talents, although recognized, hasn't produced the careers one would've expected given their abilities and strengths.

Couple of minor weaknesses:

- Didn't get into the extraneous student romance which played as a backdrop to the contest between Villard and Suba - thought it pointless and distracting. And though Mia Sara has always been very easy on the eyes, there just wasn't a valid reason for her character's inclusion or development.

- Honestly could've done without the 'Fame'-style dancing sequence. Like most movies that employ this prop - but aren't specifically about dance or dancing - completely worthless. I recognize that the point was to reveal the fundamental differences between the two methodologies of instruction, how their emotional approach to the same end goal yielded completely different perspectives. I get it. But in this context, meaningless, because the production had built up enough energy to carry the film without resorting to such a cheap emotional crutch.

Overall, the raw energy of the cast is barely contained in this well-paced and fascinating drama. And notably, showcases the missing key ingredient in most modern films today: Passion, or the lack thereof. This indie product is proof that a generous budget, well-heeled stars, splashy sfx, famous novels and pricey scripts do not equate to a good film. Too many movies are populated with walk-through performances and assembly-line scripts approved by rubber-stamp creatives.",1357862400,,3295,5.331406551059731

580906,4,6303139132,"Fast-paced, intelligent action-melodrama set in the world of professional fencing.

The actors are solid right down the line.  Particular credit must go to F. Murray Abraham, who makes a surprisingly spry leading man/antihero. It couldn't have been easy for the (then) 52 year old actor to ""bulk up"" for this role.  Not only did Abraham have to learn the art of swordfighting in what must have been a relatively short period of time, but he was faced with the challenge of keeping pace with a much younger and athletic Eric Roberts in a grueling climactic duel.  Fortunately for Abraham (and us) he pulls it off with flair.

A special tip of the hat is also due Bob Anderson, the behind-the-scenes sword master involved in the film's production.  One of those ""famous people you've never heard of"", the former Olympic fencer has trained and choreographed actors for such adventure films as ""Highlander"", ""The Princess Bride"", ""The Mask of Zorro"", the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"".  In other words, whenever you see the name Bob Anderson in the credits, you know you're going to get your money's worth action-wise.  Happily, ""By the Sword"" keeps Anderson's remarkable streak intact.  The fight scenes are taut and well-choreographed, and none of the stars look like they only learned how to pick up a sword the day before yesterday.

If ""By the Sword"" does have one flaw, it's this: too many subplots, too little time.  Co-star Mia Sara is easy enough on the eyes, but her onscreen pairing with Chris Rydell never really goes anywhere.  Likewise, Abraham's romance with co-star Elaine Kagan is left hanging in the balance.  Too bad.  Given that the movie's only 91 minutes long, one wonders how much footage ended up on the cutting room floor.

A final minor gripe goes to Bill Conti's instantly forgettable score.  This is the guy, after all, who composed the theme to ""Rocky"", arguably one of the greatest movie scores of all time, but you'd never know it from what he churns out here.  A real disappointment.

""By the Sword"" has not yet been released on DVD.  I do own the VHS, however, so a few quick comments are in order.  Overall, the video and sound quality are about as sharp as you could possibly expect on ye olde VHS format.  (In case you're wondering, it's recorded in SP, the best format available for VHS.)  The movie is presented in pan-and-scan format; however, the action is framed well throughout, so the fight sequences don't suffer.  Lastly, the video contains no extras of any kind... no surprises there.  So while a DVD release would naturally be preferable, the VHS version is still a very decent buy.",1171238400,2,2681,4.790849673202614

F. Murray Abraham plays a man just out of prison for murder. His was the foolish act of a headstrong youth. He has since come to regret it and wishes to change his life. He seeks employment as a fencing instructor in a prestigious salle but his style and skills are out of date. He can get work only as a janitor. Even so, he works to regain his lost skill and eventually gets the grudging acceptance of the maestro and is allowed to teach beginners classes. The students have a hard time taking him seriously but his skill is such that he wins acceptance from them as well. Eventually, his real identity comes out. He has a ""history"" with the maestro and tempers flare I a great clash of wills and style.

This isn't just a story about guys playing with long pointy things. It is about striving to be the best but setting limits as to what one is willing to do to be the best. It is about winning at all costs versus winning with honor. It is about vengeance and respect.

The fencing scenes are well done. Abraham does a convincing job of conveying the athleticism of fencing even though he is decades older than his opponents.

He seeks out work as the custodian for a fenching school owned by the son of the man he killed, Alexander Villard also know as the Maestro, played by Eric Roberts.
Alexander has become the conquirer. He has spent his life believing his father was killed because for one moment he was weak and foolish. The Maestro grew up telling himself that he'd never be that weak or that foolish. When it's mentioned that Alexander's father won a gold medal and world championship medal, Alexanders only comment is, ""I have two of each."" It is more or less understood that he has only retired because there is no one left to defeat.
