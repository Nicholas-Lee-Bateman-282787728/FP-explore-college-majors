8175664,4,B00008G982,"For a virtually unknown movie, starring an equally unknown cast, this movie is definitely worth watching. Having purchased it in a bargain basket from a local Wal-Mart I did not really expect much. I was however, pleasantly surprised by the good acting and the vivid portrayal of the all too true prevalence of police corruption plaguing Latin America. The movie is Venezuelan and a must have for any ardent Latino cinema buff. Two thumbs way up!",1113091200,4,446,4.881578947368421
