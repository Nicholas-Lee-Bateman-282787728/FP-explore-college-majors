5189606,5,B008XKY53C,"I watched ""The Killing"" (""Who  Killed Rosie Larsen?"") on AMC and thought it was outstanding but wanted to see the Danish series that it was based upon.  ""Forbrydelsen"" is wonderful, though different and well worth the cost and hassle of having to re-program my laptop to accept Region 2 (PAL format) so I could view it.  The AMC series did not get the attention it deserved and was easily the best (and Emmy worthy) series on TV that year.  Both are wonderful.  Watch them now instead of the drivel that is being put out these days.  We need more shows like these.",1397433600,8,564,4.480392156862745
5189607,5,B008XKY53C,"The US version doesn't compare to the original -- definitely wouldn't cause me to miss an entire night's sleep like the Danish version (hint: don't start watching in the evening if you have all the episodes available). Love the way they morphed the ending of each episode to serve as a next-episode-preview-without-spoilers effect, always that same music with the characters having different revelations. I must've rewound a minute or so at least twice at the end of each episode just to admire the technique.

I'm a fan of Danish detective series in general, doesn't really matter who-dunnit, I enjoy the ride :-) I like how their actors look and act as someone in their scenarios might -- less emphasis on wardrobe, hair & makeup with a huge effort in writing and acting. This one, Broen | Bron, and kta Mnniskor have been my favorites so far, all of which have English-speaking remakes that pale in comparison.",1451692800,,913,4.852564102564102
5189608,5,B008XKY53C,"Plot: 10/10. One of those rare productions where the suspense never ends. A political thriller as much as a murder mystery. While any given episode may tie up some loose ends, you are still left hanging at the end of each. Despite a couple holes and occasional unlikely circumstances, the political depth in Forbrydelsen helps the show rise above a typical whodunit.

Script & pace: 9/10. The writers didn't try to come up with memorable lines; instead they focused on realistic dialogue. The pace only slows down in certain scenes where raw emotions need space to be expressed.

Actors: 9/10. Sofie Grbl does well enough as the protagonist (if we're to assume she is the protagonist), but it's the strength of the ensemble cast that makes The Killing exceptional... you forget you're watching fiction.

Cinematography: 8/10. Color, vitality, and emotion are captured to bring credibility to the chaotic lives of this seemingly non-fictional world's characters.

Music: 9/10. Although repetitive, Forbrydelsen has its own unmistakable incidental music throughout, and its signature dark, hauntingly beautiful song at the end of each episode.

Binge factor: 8/10. It's difficult to stop watching. The binge potential depends on how you do with subtitles; you either ""get in the zone"" with them, or they become too much of a burden after about 3 hours...

Price: 8/10. It may seem a bit pricey, but keep in mind this set is 40 episodes of HBO-quality television. You can get this compilation of all 3 seasons for much cheaper (DVD or Blu-ray) if you go to Amazon's UK site; as a reminder, be sure to have a player that can handle foreign regions if you are considering this set.",1451606400,,1676,4.9678571428571425
5189609,5,B008XKY53C,This show is great and as american version also is great this one is a little bit different so it feel that is different show form the American version,1447891200,,151,4.241379310344827

5189613,4,B008XKY53C,"We enjoy this genre and don't mind the subtitles. This is very intelligent TV.

We had already viewed and enjoyed the USA adaptation set in Seattle. At the beginning it was quite amusing to monitor all the aspects of the original that were brought over into the USA version. Eventually, of course, enough plot differences cropped up so that viewing the original version is still a ""fresh"" experience.

For USA viewers such as us, some of the Danish high-level political maneuvering is somewhat puzzling. For some of those scenes, we often had to just let detailed understanding pass.",1427068800,,583,4.938775510204081
5189614,4,B008XKY53C,"Not on the level of Bron/Broen, Borgen, or Spiral. Not even on the level of the American re-make (a rare case where the American version is better). But good and absorbing nonetheless, as long as you're patient with the sometimes ponderous political subplot. Another good reason to have a multi-region blu-ray player.",1420329600,,317,5.115384615384615
5189615,5,B008XKY53C,"better and cheaper than a month of cable.  if you liked ""house of cards,"" you won't like this; this is smart and good and nobody gets laid.  think of a region-free dvd player as your gateway drug to better tv.",1412294400,9,209,4.2

8532226,5,B008XKY53C,"Have just finished series 1 of the trilogy (20 episodes). Watched 2 every night for 10 nights. This a great show with good acting and lots of twists and turns. Like others I have watched (Trapped, The Bridge, Spiral) there are a few unanswered questions that leave you wondering. Also 1 or 2 plot holes, but still great to watch. Recommended. I will be disappointed when I have finished the trilogy. Where do I go from here. I have hearing aids but still find English speaking films sometimes hard to understand so the subtitles in foreign movies and TV series are a great help to me.",1489190400,,584,4.518867924528302
8532227,5,B008XKY53C,This series is a great Danish noir. The show has three stories and each one is riveting. The show is in subtitles for us who speak English. It has wonderful characters and is different than the USA version of the show. I own both and enjoy them. Strong female lead played by a wonderful talented actress. Good writing! What more does a mystery thrill fan need. RUN OUT AND SEE THIS.,1485907200,,382,4.394366197183099
8532228,5,B008XKY53C,Great series. Just a little help for folks who seem to have a little trouble playing it re region. Download VLC Media Player and play it on your pc. If you have an HDMI inlet on your tv just connect it to the pc and should be no problems. Cheers.,1485734400,,246,3.94
8532229,5,B008XKY53C,"Smart, engrossing, perhaps a trifle slow moving.  Who can be disappointed with three seasons and more than 40 episodes!

8532232,5,B008XKY53C,"Such an excellent example of how good well crafted TV can be.  Also, it helps me practice listening to Danish as I study the language.  No worries though, there are subtitles in English.  Make sure your DVD play can play the right region disks!",1455667200,,244,4.5
