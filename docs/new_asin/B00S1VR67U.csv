8696978,3,B00S1VR67U,"I bought this is a two-fer (it was bundled with a Cary Grant collection) at a big box store hoping to pick up a print of ""Royal Wedding"" on the cheap. It came to less than two dollars per movie! Plus, I was encouraged by the label on the back:  ""Exclusively licensed for distribution from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Inc.""  Unfortunately, Mill Creek Entertainment may have the licensing rights to SELLl these prints, they did NOT have access to original prints of these films.

Picture quality ranged from excellent (""The Notorious Landlady) to lousy (""Second Chorus""). The transfer quality for ""You'll Never Get Rich"" is very good, but ""Royal Wedding"" is acceptable at best. The sound is very good on all four films.

Here's the four films on this collection:

Disc-1 (Both movies on one side of the disc.)
""You'll Never Get Rich""  (black-and-white, running time:  88:28, release date:  1941, IMDB rating:  6.9)

""The Notorious Landlady"" (black-and-white,  running time:  122:39, release date:  1962, IMDB rating:  6.8) This film is a comedy, not a musical and Astaire is essentially in a supporting role. The screenplay was written by Larry Gelbart (MASH tv series) and Blake Edwards (the ""Pink Panther"" films).

Disc-2 (Both movies on one side of the disc.)
""Second Chorus""  (black-and-white, running time: 83:48, release date:  1941, IMDB rating:  5.9)

""Royal Wedding""  (Technicolor, running time:  92:28, release date:  1951, IMDB rating:  6.7)

There are no extras on these discs, nor is there close captioning or foreign language options. If you really want the films on disc one, this collection can be a bargain at the right price. If you really want the films on disc two, just be mindful of the poor picture quality.",1451692800,2,1734,5.024647887323944
8696979,4,B00S1VR67U,I'm a huge fan of Fred Astaire and this collection has some great movies. My only problem is that Second Chorus has rather poor quality. It's not the DVD's fault but it seems the movie was filmed with low quality and it wasn't something that could be fixed through the conversion to DVD. It ruins the viewing a bit (just on that one film) so if Second Chorus is you favorite movie you may be disappointed.,1451433600,,405,4.342105263157895
8696980,4,B00S1VR67U,"the subtitle ""song and dance man"" doesn't fit this set of films. 1 film isn't a musical at all. and another has a limited amount. The two films that does have it are worth having. ""You'll never get rich"" and ""Royal Wedding""  the other two films ""Second Chorus"" is ok but not his best. and  ""The Notorious Landlady"" is a comedy film which I haven't watched yet, but looks like a good movie. If your a Fred Astaire fan like me, you'll enjoy the set.  If your a musical fan, then you may be disappointed.  My goal is collect  all his films. (I'm very close now()

In case you're not aware, Royal Wedding contains the dance number where he dances on the ceiling. It's also a mini bio because his sister left to be on her own -just like Jane Powell does in this film. Peter Lawford also stars. It's a fun film to watch.

Second Chorus is about him and his buddy trying to land a part in Arte Shaw's Band, and both falling for the same woman.  This was his first film he made after he and Ginger split in 1939.  He then made a list a better films after this one. This is not a bomb, just not him at his best.

You;ll never get rich was one of the two (or 3?) films he made with Rita Hayworth. The two are great together.
So if you're a fan pf Fred Astaire, then add this set",1444953600,2,1268,4.056224899598393
8696981,2,B00S1VR67U,"Transfer to dvd o.k. for: You'll Never Get Rich + The Notorious Landlady.
BAD quality TRANSFER for: Second Chorus + Royal Wedding. These two are waste and carbage.",1442534400,,163,4.857142857142857
