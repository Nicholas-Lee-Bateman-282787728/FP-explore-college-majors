4518217,4,B0050UEVRS,"After a glorious weekend visiting Southern brother Sid it was back to business as usual. The first order on the list would be to enjoy another installment of Puppet master goodness as Halloween approaches with fury. Typically every year around this time we go on a horror tear that is sometimes a little creature specific. Well this year appears to be dedicated to our half pint, low budget killer puppets with viewings of Puppet Master 3, 4, and 5. When it comes to this series either you love it or hate it. Some people can't quite grasp the level of B 90's Full Moon supplies, and that's just fine. It's not everybody's cup of Nutella coffee. For us, this series provides some immense enjoyment delivering ""the feel"" we often seek on a weekly basis. In fact we've enjoyed the progression in which the series has moved towards where the puppets become good guys.

The film is centered around a young scientist named Rick Myers, whose lives ambition is to bring artificial items to life. Yeah he's a total nerd-fest that looks like a Matt Collins stunt double. As he searches for a way to bring these objects to life he comes across a chest full of the Puppet Master dolls. In addition he finds the journal which explains how to juice them up with a secret serum to inject life. He invites his good time buddies over to watch and asks ""enjoying the show b.....?"" Luckily the puppets are kind towards Rick and even become his team mate when an evil-lizard looking puppet is released from the underworld to reign down blows upon them. The creature is there to destroy the puppets who have the secret serum, and anybody in it's way. Naturally the Puppet Master gang doesn't play that game and overcomes this lizard beast, saving the world from it's 3 foot destructive path.

Puppet Master IV came at a time when Full Moon supplied the local video store shelves with low budget goods. The sentimental value alone was worth at least 4 stars. To appreciate a film of this caliber, one must really enjoy that grainy, vhs feel that we used to love as kids. It's leaps and bounds above the junk Full Moon pumps out at this point in life. Really what's not to love about a restless crew of killer puppets? It may not provide the same amount of fun as hanging out watching Halloween with some pumpkin roll or huge cookie sandwiches, but it does the trick when you have to head on back to the North Pole. If you're a fan of the Puppet Master series then this should do the trick. Especially for some light hearted Octoberfest viewing.",1351036800,,2523,4.542857142857143
4518218,5,B0050UEVRS,"Noch Videos provides a digital remastered copy of this movie which I didn't get in the other Puppet master movies. Bonus features includes an introduction to new puppet Decapitron, a featurette on the stop motion company that brought the Tohlon dolls to life as well as features on director and producers who work on this film and other horror movies they've done.

Like Puppet Master movies 1,2, and 5 this movie takes us back to Bodege Bay Inn. Rick is not only the new caretaker of the hotel but before the end of the movie he'll replace Toulun as the new Puppetmaster. He is working on The Omega Project and the secret of life. A secret that presents itself when he finds a series of puppets walking about on their own. As talk about in  previous Puppetmaster movies the magic goes back to that on ancient Egypt and the God who seek to regain the magic for itself.  The puppets rally their abilities to protect the new Puppet master from the demons that Sutec is sending into our world to kill all those who seek the secret and only a new puppet called Decapitron seems to be the answer.  Its  just a question of if the new puppet can be given life before everyone is dead.

If your a fan of the puppet master series this one is a must to own.",1331942400,,1247,4.353448275862069

8451900,5,B0050UEVRS,"Well fellow Full Moon/Horror Fans, the inevitable is almost upon us, yes, I'm talking about retiring your favorite Full Moon box set because if Charlie keeps this up, you'll want to upgrade those DVDs as fast as you can! Yea, I know that the first Puppet Master's transfer left a lot to be desired, but those after it definitely make up for it! I'm gonna answer a couple of basic questions here before I delve into the longer review, yes this flick is indeed the same cut as the VHS, it's missing no violence (Demonic Toys) and all scenes are in their original place (Tourist Trap).

The Film - I'm honestly not going to go into this as much as the other reviewers have. The basic plot is that Toulon is no longer our hero, this time we have Rick, an extremely intelligent engineer with a knack for robotics. Rick finds our puppet heros in their trunk around the same time as the Egyptian God Sutek sends his army of totem's to destroy anyone who has access to the formula that gives the puppets life. The flick itself is extremely fun, great one liners and the effects are pretty terrific as well, the flick's ending does leave a little to be desired, but things are wrapped up neatly in Puppet Master 5.

Video - Man, I'd be lying if I said the transfer was anything but absolutely terrific! The film is presented in it's original intended 16x9 ratio and the framing is absolutely beautiful! When comparing this disc to the original Full Moon dvd, it's like night and day, yes the DVD version does have more information on the top and bottom of the full screen picture, but the blu-ray itself gives more side information, it just ""feels right"". Both the DVD and Blu-ray run a total time of 1:18:59 so nothing is missing from this disc at all. As far as transfer? The movie itself does have a slight layer of grain that is hardly noticeable at all, even the moments of stop motion are nearly flawless (A feat most companies cannot conquer!) The reds, and blacks are absolutely gorgeous, and many more small things are noticeable on the screen, such as the Security guard's scarring face, or how dirty Rick's mirror actually is! The totem creatures are absolutely gorgeous, the unique carvings on each totem is finally something we can admire! As for flaws? There were 2 minor instances where I noticed small debris on the screen, and I could see the strings on Totem during his fight with Blade, a minor annoyance. The film itself has a bitrate that lows to 22.3 Mb/s to an astounding 29.7 Mb/s, such a strong transfer!

Sound - Here is where my reviews suffer the most. The disc has 2 audio tracks, 5.1 and 2.0. I watched the 5.1 audio channel on my basic HDTV (No surround system here) and I noticed no issues or hissing at all. The original Puppet Master theme can be heard during certain parts of the flick, and no pops or drops present at all. The disc does not include any subtitles.

Extras - I remember when the disc was first announced online, Jeff Burr definitely wanted to be included, so we're in for a treat with the commentary track! Jeff discusses the movie in detail and has a ton of fun while watching the flick. The movie does include the original Video Zone extra, clocking in at exactly 21:04 minutes in standard definition. The disc is rounded out with some HD trainers for Puppet Master 1-3, Subspecies 2 and 3, The Vampire Journals, and Specters. The film itself does start with an opening with Full Moon founder Charles Band spreading the good word about FullMoonStreaming, and another ad follows features nostalgic Full Moon goodness.

Final Verdict - At first I was a little upset at the 25 dollar price tag, but if there is as much effort put into any forthcoming discs, that price tag is well worth the price! I never once thought I'd get to see my childhood favorites in glorious HD, but if Charlie and Crew keep this up, I'll definitely be double dipping all of my Full Moon discs! This is one disc that is definitely something I'd recommend all around.",1451606400,3,3984,4.527777777777778
8451901,4,B0050UEVRS,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Prior to my site crashing back in 2012, I had the opportunity to review PUPPET MASTER 3 & 4 on Blu-ray, and I loved them both.  Ive been a big fan of the PUPPET MASTER series for many years, after seeing the first one way back in the early 90s.  Since the release of the original, the franchise has taken many twists and turns, mostly for the better.  PUPPET MASTER 4 was recently released on Blu-ray, and it, like its brothers, is still a blast after all this time.  If youve never experienced the PM films before, now is the time to do so; the HD transfers will give you all the crazy puppet mayhem you can handle and then some!

This is one of my favorite films from the series.  I think in part because the puppets are in a transitional phase, reinventing themselves as heroes as opposed to bad guys.  This is intriguing for several reasons, as it changes the perspective by which the viewer judges them.  Not to mention, its funny as well.

PUPPET MASTER 4 is shot well and looks great from a production standpoint.  The same high quality stop-motion techniques are used, and the result is yet another satisfying film experience.

The acting is good with Gordon Currie and Chandra West heading up a decent cast.  None of the actors give a truly breakout performance, however they still do a nice job in their roles.  I did thoroughly enjoy Guy Rolfe, however, who portrays the aged Toulon.  The original Toulon was played by actor William Hickey, who will forever remain Toulon to mebut Rolfe does an excellent job of filling Hickeys shoes.

The special effects, as I mentioned above, are once again top notch and worthy of recognition.  I never tire of seeing the puppets in their motions, as they always appear to actually be moving.  Theres a stark difference between stop-motion and CG, and it shows sometimes onscreen.  Even the best CG can appear cartoonish, however the best stop-motion can be hard to differentiate from real life.  Such is the case here; you might just be blown away by what the effects team accomplishes.

PUPPET MASTER 4 is a great film, and its a worthy addition to the franchise.  The Blu-ray looks great with a nice HD picture and some quality sound.  I recommend picking this one up soon.",1449100800,,2297,4.5623471882640585

8451904,4,B0050UEVRS,"This was an ok sequel, but not up tp the standard set by the first 2.  I have a complete set, though.",1364860800,,101,3.590909090909091
8451905,4,B0050UEVRS,"This is hardly simply ""another"" killer puppets movie.  This sequel brings a good combination of silly straight-faced nonsense and fun kills along with some new other-worldly elements.

SEQUEL SIDEBAR:  Puppet Master III (1991; set in 1941 and having the highest production value of the first three franchise installments) is actually a prequel to Puppet Master (1989), which occurs decades later in present day and is seamlessly followed story-wise by Puppet Master II (1991; which was the least serious, most zany installment).  This fourth installment returns us to present day after Puppet Master II.

B-horror sequel director Jeff Burr (Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings, Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter, Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Stepfather 2) drops us right in the middle of the silliness in this Jim Henson's Storyteller-turned-evil sequel.  Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe; Puppet Master III, V and Retro Puppet Master; Dolls, The Bride) had obtained the ancient Egyptian secret of reanimation from some Arab back in the 1920s-30s, but in part 4 some puppet-like ghoul-demon named Sutec on a throne claims that Toulon ""stole"" this secret and has put some evil netherworld at risk of discovery by mankind.  That story sounds about par for the direct-to-video course, right?

This fourth installment returns us to present day after Puppet Master II.  Rick (Gordon Currie; Friday the 13th Part VIII, The Terror Within II, Puppet Master 5) is a robot engineer living in the same oceanview hotel (from part 1 and 2) as the off-season caretaker.  He is working towards artificial intelligence in his spare time.  You know, for fun.  For whatever reason, he has Blade (from parts 1 and 2) in his office.

Meanwhile, in a high-tech laboratory working with Rick, some scientists have discovered some weird netherworld puppet-sized, fleshy doll-monster gremlins.  They kill Dr. Leslie Piper (Stacie Randall; Ghoulies IV, Trancers 4 and 5, From Dusk' til Dawn 2) and steal her soul for the netherworld powers.

Rick has a dinner party and invites his girlfriend and iron man athlete Susie (Chandra West; White Noise, Puppet Master 5), metaphysicist and psychic-channeler Lauren (Teresa Hill; Puppet Master 5), and his friend and scientist Cameron (Ash Adams; A Nightmare on Elm Street).  It's funny how so many horror movies rely on a dinner party to get a bunch of people into a house before the slaughter.

They find Toulon's rather informative journal which reveals his history, the secret life-giving serum and puppets Pinhead and Jester (four movie veterans), Six-Shooter (from part 1) and Tunneler (four movie veteran), all of whom he reanimates with the glowing green syringed formula.  As usual, the puppets each get their moments to shine.  Except for the underplayed Jester, who has the least to offer in terms of interesting kills.

A few inconsistent notes... Tunneler ""died"" in Puppet Master II and Six-Shooter, while presented in the prequel Puppet Master III, was nowhere to be seen in parts 1 or 2.  Yet here he is as if he was always one of the gang.  On the other hand, who cares?  I'm happy to have them all and their endearing stop-motion glory.

This movie is fun. The puppets play laser tag with Rick; Toulon is back, but not as the over-the-top farcical character from Puppet Master III; an idiot opens a gate to the gremlin-infested netherworld; Toulon anoints Rick the new puppet master; and, like in the prequel Puppet Master III, the puppets are the good guys.  I love it when they gang up on the netherworld gremlins in stop-motion melee. We also have a new over-the-top bad guy (Sutec) and a new puppet, the head-swapping Decapitron who microwaves  the nether-gremlins 'til they burst.

This whole movie boils down to turning the puppets into good guys as they fight a handful of Sutec's evil nether-gremlins; hardly a plot.  The movie ends with what is clearly a nod to the audience that a sequel was planned before this movie even hit the shelves.  But it's a fun ride and fans of the franchise will continue enjoying consistent quality.",1364688000,,4074,5.038805970149253
