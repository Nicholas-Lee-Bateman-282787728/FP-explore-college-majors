7956902,3,B00005YAJX,"While watching ""The Ultimate Game,"" I was thinking to myself that this movie was made too late. By 2001, bare bones martial arts tournament films were pass, and this was likely reflected in the movie's very low budget appearance. To my surprise, it was actually made in 1998, at the very end of the boom period of direct-to-video karate flicks. In other words, the film languished without a release for about three years, and after seeing it in its entirety, this isn't surprising. ""Ultimate Game"" just barely manages a three-star rating, but I can see others easily rating it lower: this one's got a ton of fight scenes to its credit but very little else.

The story: several teams of martial artists take part in a tournament to crown the best of the best, though fair play is hampered by the unscrupulous antics of an evil manager.

You can pretty much skip the first half of the movie. Not only is the indie budget visible via its video quality, boring direction, and almost nonexistent acting (I nominate Jennifer Doubleday for the ""worst crying scene of the decade"" award), but the characters are all largely faceless goofballs who you can't care a hoot about. There are some pretty silly scenes - Mark Griffin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hard-Corps/dp/B000GDH9IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hard Corps</a>) giving a drunk man the world's most halfhearted beating, T.J. Storm (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Cobra/dp/B007IEDK1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Cobra</a>) somehow being completely unharmed by a head-on car collision - but they're played too lackluster to be worth laughing at.

Most of the fighters here are pretty unknown in the film world - the most prolific is definitely the aforementioned T.J. Storm, followed by Paul Logan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballistica/dp/B003ZM81A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballistica</a>) and Andre McCoy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TKO/dp/B0014VPFVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TKO</a>) - but they're still a talented bunch and get plenty of opportunity to strut their stuff. Once the tournament begins, the film averages one fight every four minutes, and taken as a cumulative total, the collection isn't bad. At worst, the brawls move slowly enough that the strikes and blocks look predetermined, and virtually all of them have that vague amateur look to them of shots being held too long and some disharmony between connecting shots. However, there's no denying the fighters' athleticism, and the choreography has its moments. Stars J.D. Rifkin and Paul Logan are like nimbler versions of Dolph Lundgren, and T.J. Storm performs some impressive kung fu. My favorite fight is a kick-filled match between stunt warriors Stephanie Cheeva and Melissa Barker. This stuff could definitely be worse.

Recommending this movie is difficult. Casual action fans will be alienated by the low budget look of the film, and even seasoned DTV aficionados may not have much tolerance for the movie's low points when there's much better stuff on the market. In the end, I think I can only push this one towards that niche audience of karate cinema that particular enjoys movies with tournaments in them. In general, everyone should rent this one before considering a purchase.",1398038400,2,3401,5.782435129740519
7956903,3,B00005YAJX,"The Ultimate Game is one of those movies that tries to use all flash and very little else.  There are good fights, fighters with extremely ripped bodies, and a fighting locale that is beautiful.  Unfortunately there is no beauty within the movie itself.

The worst thing about this movie is the sound.  The sound is crappy, from voices to effects.  You can actually hear the actors speaking into a microphone and footsteps outside are dubbed with footsteps in a hallway.  In some scenes you can hear ocean waves on the beach and other scene you hear no waves, even though they are cleary there.  The acting is pretty bad, but the muscle build of these male actors can make up for it, especially the villains.  My favorite is Sam Slater, played by Paul Logan.  If he could act a little better, he would make a really good villain.

The first 45 minutes of the movies is very slow.  There is no story, but instead tiresome scenes of retrieving fighters for the tournament.  The tournament is about the only good thing in the movie.  It takes place on a beautiful beach and there are several fights with lots of decent choreography.  The final fight between the main character (played by J.D. Rifkin) and Slater (Paul Logan) is about 3 minutes with nothing too exciting in the way of choreography.  The only nice thing about the fight is the two guys end up fighting in the ocean water.

There is a little twist at the end I did not expect, only surprise in the whole movie.

In the end, this movie was about what I expected.  Considering how low budget it is and the actors involved, it could be worse.  If you enjoy movies with lenghty tournaments for lots of fights, than Ultimate Game may please.  Don't be fooled by the dvd case cover or dvd cover.  The case shows 2 sports cars, which are not in the movie.  The dvd cover displays Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport 4...no idea why that is on there but he is not in Ultimate Game.",1155859200,,1931,4.472779369627507
7956904,3,B00005YAJX,"THE ULTIMATE GAME is one of those martial arts movies that appeals to the testosterone and T&A that's in all of us.  Who of us over the age of..never mind..wouldn't like to have bodies like J.D. Rifkin or Paul Logan?  What about the foxy chicks?  The lush island setting?

ULTIMATE GAME is an average film focusing on a tournament held for a million dollar prize, and the good team vs. the bad team.  The fight sequences are fairly imaginative (choreographed by T. J. Storm, who also appears in the film) and there's a nice twist at the end.

Rifkin is the All American hero; Paul Logan is the studly bad guy.  It's a lot better than some of the other films recently released, so if you like kung fu fighting, join in.",1093305600,,718,4.393939393939394
