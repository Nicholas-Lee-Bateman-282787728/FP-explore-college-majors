5445316,4,B00AKGG5PS,"Loved this sweet, yet  not syrupy story.  A bit of history and historic figures rounded out this well-paced, prettily filmed dvd.  It reminded me of the magical realism found in ""Mrs. Potter"".  Though fairies appear, it may or may not be only in the children's imagination.  I bought copies for both an adult and a 7 year old.  I watched it because it starred a PBS actor I liked.  Had not heard of or seen it back when it first came out. So glad I did.",1478476800,,453,4.1976744186046515

As for the story, well, if you can shed a few years and remember some of those magical moments of childhood, you just might see the world again as the two little girls did....as least for awhile. A beautiful movie, it is both engaging and uplifting; unlike any other I have ever seen.

5445386,5,B00AKGG5PS,"This is a very charming movie based on a true story that took place in the early 1900s.  Two young girls claimed to have photographed ""real"" fairies and all of England was just electrified by the news--and by the photos. Even Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle were drawn into the drama. The girls are charming, the story is wonderful and there is a very interesting spiritual element, all set against the background of WWI in the UK.

Is it true? Did they photograph fairies? You have to watch the film to find out. But if you want to see the daughter of one of these young girls talk about what really happened, you can find an interview with her on Youtube, from a Brit TV show.  Fascinating.

This is completely a family film, you can show it in any company--but be prepared to have a family discussion afterwards. And to buy your kids a camera.",1430352000,11,849,4.423076923076923

Also, the sound track music is really wonderful and I would love a CD of the music but it is only available a great expense ( over $50.00) and is probably just a recording of the sound track and not a performance of the music.

5445415,5,B00AKGG5PS,A darling movie for kids and adults who believe in faeries and magic!,1420934400,,69,4.384615384615385
5445416,5,B00AKGG5PS,"I'll be honest, the only reason this film caught my eye was because ""Fairy"" and ""True Story"" were included in the title.  I mean, how can you let such a ""contradiction"" go untouched, right?  But you know, this turned out to be a really wonderful film that raised very important questions...especially in our modern scientific society.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Really, there is nothing that is particularly contrary or offensive.  No sex, no innuendos, no language (maybe save one tame British expletive), and etc.  In terms of technicality, this is a completely safe film for the family.  However, I do have to mention a 5 things that may be crucial for some people.  The 1st is this...the time period of the setting was during a time when mediums and other spiritualists were particularly prominent.  In the film, those kinds of people have no prominent position on the plot, but they are introduced early on as part of the setting...to help better set up the actual conflict of the film.  Some parents may be ok with this...others not.  The 2nd thing is (and I'll state this generically so as to avoid revealing much plot) but a dead sibling appears...the question whether it was a spirit or perhaps a physical manifestation of the past is left open to debate.  3rdly, I know that there are some folks that are particularly sensitive to having their kids witness any form of child abuse on screen.  In this case, a reporter desperate for answers seizes one of the girls and shakes her a bit...she is immediately saved of course. 4thly, the film takes place during WWI, you will meet various soldiers with varying degrees of wounds to put it nicely...they aren't terribly graphic though...but one soldier did suffer a massive facial scar/wound and we see the result of it (we don't see how he got it). For the 5th, and last, this one seems more a cultural thing.  This film largely originated from the UK and they have different sensibilities for what is acceptable in film and what is not based on the UK films I have seen.  And so, we see one of the main heroines (keep in mind they are young girls pre-development) having a plot-important conversation with her cousin while the Mom baths her in a movable tub.  You can see the higher portion of her chest...not clearly though due to her arms.  This is in no way sexual and whatnot.  But it still needs to be mentioned.

AS TO THE FILM (ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT SPOILERS)...
As stated before, this is a film based off of an event that happened in England known as the ""Cottingley Fairies"".  The basic premise is that two girls who could see fairies and managed to photograph some of them caused quite a stir in England.  The plot is simple enough and nothing extraordinary (save for the subject matter).  In fact, the first third of the movie would have been a 4/5 (leaning towards 3) star rating from me.  It was in how it escalated later and how symbolic the characters became in the rest of the movie that earned a 5 from me.  You see, there are a lot of important characters in the film...but three in particular drive the questions and dialogue.  You have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (author of Sherlock Holmes in case you don't know), Harry Houdini (one of the finest and probably most impactful illusionist in history), and a nameless reporter that still serves as a prominent figure in the tale.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (along with Edward Gardner) believe the girls whole heartedly.  Not only that, but they see it as something hopeful and will be a discovery to change civilization as they knew it.  Harry Houdini, however represents the neutral skeptic.  Him being an illusionist himself and one that does not ascribe to the spiritual, can't help but question the validity of the girls' claims.  Yet, he is not one to attack them...he just doesn't have ""proof"" to their statement.  The Nameless Reporter is one who seeks to destroy the girl's claims because ""he knows better"" and since he ""knows"" fairies aren't real, he sees a need to quash it...and make some dough on the way.  Simply put, this whole film is a dialogue about belief, empiricism, and truth.  It asks questions like ""If you can't prove that it isn't...does that already mean it is?"", or ""can pure empiricism lead to a fully complete existence?"", and other such questions.  In the end though, it is a very hopeful film that tries to remind you of the magic of life and living...that cold hard facts aren't everything by themselves...and that growing up doesn't mean you have to become jaded, cold, and dull.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
absolutely none.  But it does had a choice of English or French audio as well as English subtitling.

ALL IN ALL:
This was a film that did manage to keep me riveted.  The thing was I had to make it past the first 3rd of it before it became truly interesting.  But if you can do that, you just might find something very valuable and profound, here.",1420243200,35,4884,4.6491841491841495

5445423,4,B00AKGG5PS,"If you are at all curious about the phenom. of faries, you will love this movie.  It contains beautiful camera work and very good to great performances by a talented cast.  This is not the ""Disney version"" of these events.  This is the real life version of this story.  Yes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini did travel to the countryside to see what was up.  So much intelligence went into the making of this film that it really is irrestible.  (For an interesting surprise or two, Google the two actresses who play the leads to see what they look like now.  More could be written about this story, but at the risk of spoiling it for those who will be charmed by the film.  Another heads up: Amazon sells the book that Conan Doyle wrote about the girls, along with the photos they took. The title of the book is THE COMING OF THE FAIRIES.  It, like the movie is quite something.  LanceB",1409961600,17,894,4.363636363636363
