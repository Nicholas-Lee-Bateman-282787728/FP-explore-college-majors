7965828,3,B000069JCX,"I started out watching Salman's newest films. I enjoyed this film made when he seemed to be ""becoming Salman Kahn"". You can almost see the change in him to come. I like this more loveable boy and the beautiful songs. The story was interesting. What's not to love, beautiful people, great music, and wonderful scenery!",1343088000,,317,4.781818181818182
7965829,4,B000069JCX,"Amazon doesn't provide a summary for Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge (means ""I won't be able to forget you""), so I'll write one:

The movie starts with a young man, Veer, who is enjoying his life with his caring parents and a wonderful love interest. But he soon realizes he doesn't have any memory of his childhood, nor do his parents have any photographs to help him remember. After Veer experiences several visions of chases and murder attempts, and then a real-life murder attempt, his parents admit that he is not their biological son. They actually found him in the river with gunshots all over. ""Veer"" then uses clues to trace his steps back to his old hometown and old acquaintances to figure out what happened that led someone to shoot him.

The acting is fairly well done, and even though this is not a 100% original story (parts of it were inspired by ""The Bourne Identity""), it is pretty good for a Bollywood movie. It is somewhat hard to believe that Veer was successfully able to retrace his steps and recover his memory, but I guess if Veer failed to find the people and places of his past, there would be no story. And if he found out segments of his old life too slowly, the movie would have been way too long. This movie is actually 2 hours and 40 minutes, but it is time pretty well spent full of romance, mystery, and violence.

I think the DVD cover design is not very appealing to me, but Veer's story and the occasional surprises in the story made it worth viewing.",1297900800,5,1480,4.453874538745388
7965830,1,B000069JCX,"The seller appeared to be a seasoned professional. Prior to shippment, he viewed the DVD and discovered that the recording was bad. He refunded my money. I will still like to own the DVD is I could lay may hands on a good one.

The rating is for the defective product, not the Seller's customer service.",1242691200,,303,4.410714285714286
