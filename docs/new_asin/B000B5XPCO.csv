8081677,1,B000B5XPCO,"Oh my, what a frightening creature...a man dressed up in a monster suit with glowing green eyes.  A group of teenagers who witness a meteor crash and end up on a lonely island with the lighthouse keeper and his wife.  Isn't this original?

Yipes..this one is pretty bad.  The actors are awful, the effects non-existent and the level of terror -- well, there is none.  Someone must have given the writer/director some money for Christmas and he decided to make this totally crappy film.  Don't waste your time, folks.",1144454400,3,516,4.741573033707865
8081678,5,B000B5XPCO,"I cannot believe that a screen writer could actually have the audacity and verve to pull off such an amazing script. The characters are not just paper thin no good talent beatniks that couldn't act to save there grandparents, parents, or there own lifes. The action is non stop unbelievable with an array of special effects that outrival even Star Wars III in their technological advancement. The plot is a masterpiece of understatement- 5 teens end up stranded on island with alien- wow!!
Oh, and don't even get me started on the creature effects. The monster itself was awesome! I mean, this is what I wanna see when I shell out $3.50 of my hard earned money!
Please, if you are reading this review, go now to your video store and say to the attendant'""I've got to have this movie!""
The meteorite scene alone will win you over.",1132617600,3,829,4.608108108108108
8081679,1,B000B5XPCO,"It starts off with the surprise ultra-realism of barely two films, like ""Open Water,"" and that grand hope of an actual original amatuer effort.
  Hope turns to despair for our soon-to-be stereotypes as well.
  I consider that a broken promise.

  I couldn't believe - literally - the monster was a man in a suit, a dying relation of the creature from the Black Lagoon.
  And that it was The Telepathic Thing - with glowing green telepathetic eyes - taking over people.
  Becoming a stereo-stereo-stereotype type.

  So I don't mind exposing all of the no surprises.
  And such an intelligent The Thing that could only make the exact same stereotype growls, and yawns, in the same voice as every other alien. Not a mutant bit different. Even in only existing to kill kill and eat more gore.

THIS FILM IS IN STEREO
==================
  All the stereotypes (at least they could make them 5.1 types these days) are here.

  1) The character crap (bickering and insults) filmakers always resort to when they can't think of any original characters.
  2) The token **shole coward who turns boring hero.
  3) The gratuitous - and grateful - lesbian encounter.
  3) The unexpected one is taken over, and the misdirection to another (it fooled me. No it did).
  4) The ""Let's make a stand,"" is so weak a reason for staying, as if for creature comforts instead of creature killing. Why? Revenge...I guess?

  I can take stereotypes if I expect it but going by the first 2 reviews of excellence I was expecting a special smorgasbord.
  I now realise they were 11 or 12 years old. And I was too --- as naive.
  I soon learnt, with the title ""Predator Island"" I was asking for --it.
  I tell ya, it shoulda been a comedy. It had all the ingredients except laughs.

THE SPECIAL EFFECTS
=================

WHAT THE CRITICS SAID
===================
  And the ""reviews"" on the back cover:

  ""AN ABSOLUTE SCREAM FEST!""
  ""RIP YOUR HEART OUT HORROR""
  ""UNRIVALLED TERROR""

  Yes they are in quotes, but please, put the filmakers names after them.
  Am I really STILL so gullible? YES.
  Have I FINALLY learnt my lesson now? NO.
  I realise there is always someone to say its the best thing since sliced movies (whether that be discs or film), but when they have to go even below Stent Rubberburger of radio XJKHGO its just - very stupidly clever; no one has heard of nobody!

SOUND DESIGN
===========
  And please, if I see one more film where thunder happens simultaneously with lightning - none more than this flop in the ocean - I will personally throw their DVD into a lightning bolt to consummate their annoying vision that destroys even that reality. You know - suspension of disbelief. Dudards.

  Oh but I forgot, that goes with the stereotypes.
  They see, our ears and eyes must sense in stereo, or we cannot comprehend what lightning is!!

THE SPECIAL EFFECTS
=================
  1) Oh ok I thought the meteor sometimes was ok, fairly real.
  2) There just doesn't even seem to be a real lighthouse, just the worse, green&white video - or more like photo - effects like some 60's kids TV show

THE DEAD END at last
==========--------
  The most exciting scene, as often is the case, are the production logo sequences before the film.
  And, as if again in true stereo, the very last scene of the actual film - the one surprise, even though I remember one film at least used that. Kingdom of the Spiders.
  We all know what the stereo end end normally is.

  I'm sorry filmakers - I know (growl, yawn) you are going to read this.
  I had to balance those first 2 reviews with the truth, and reason.

8081680,1,B000B5XPCO,"Oh my friends is this bad. I will watch just about any horror movie because I'm a die hard fan, but there a few now and then that make me want to rethink my obsession. Some college kids (how may times do we say that in these b-grades?) go sailing and end up with engine trouble at an island with a couple who live and operate the islands lighthouse. A meteor (absolutely cheap and fake looking) has crashed into the island and aliens who take over your minds are now running amok........

These aliens are just plain crap, not the amazing make-up and special effects we are used to in, say, any of the aliens, no, here we get actors in cheap, lame, cheesy costumes and they don't even fit right (watch a couple of the ""attack"" scenes and you'll see what I mean). Also, the acting is atrocious, but it doesn't really matter cuz you've never heard of any of them. The female actors were obviously chosen for one reason, eye candy. But even  that is a let-down because we get no nudity what so ever, I know that sounds wrong, but I'm really grasping at straws here trying to figure out ways to improve this garbage!!!

People, skip this, skip this, oh please skip this, I'd rather watch any of the Aliens for the 30th time then ever give this movie a 2nd chance.

acting...............1.5 stars, Good thing there no-namers
directing............1.5 stars, Editing is just as bad
special effects......1 star, Lots of cheesy green glow....
scare rating.........no stars, Please, laughed my ass off
quality..............1 star, so cheaply made, no effort at all",1131753600,6,1554,4.660583941605839

This film is AWESOME!  A must see for a Friday or Saturday night especially if you are a fan of aquatic alien lifeforms!  Do yourself a favor, October 25th rush to the local video shop and rent or buy this baby.  REAL FUN! Cheers!!",1126224000,3,271,4.254901960784314
8081682,4,B000B5XPCO,"This movie is a GEM amongst direct-to-video movies!  It has more quality in all areas then most of the direct to dvd horror/creature films out there.  Solid acting, great locations (I love lighthouses), fearsome monster.  Is there a sequel planned?!

BTW:  Unbelievable surprise ending.",1126224000,3,286,5.409090909090909
