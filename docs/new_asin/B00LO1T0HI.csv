8667084,2,B00LO1T0HI,"An entry in the Kojuncha project, in which three of Japan's foremost horror manga creators wrote and directed films based on their own works.  All three of these films were released in 2011.  The horror film The Blinds is directed by Ochazuke Nori, creator of such manga as Hime. One night, Sakura witnesses a murder through the Venetian blinds of her apartment in a housing complex.  However, she is unable to identify the killer because they were wearing a mask.  The more Sakura thinks about it, she begins to suspect her older sister's boyfriend.

This 60-minute film is rather low-key and does make a real attempt at being suspenseful, but the interaction and dialogue lacks the nuance to make it interesting.  I tried to put my finger on why it doesnt work, and I think one big reason is that it lacks an edge, resulting in lots of dull filler instead of impending dread.  The script and acting are also subpar, which doesnt help.

I read somewhere that Yoshihiro Nishimura was supervisor of gore effects for this movie.  This is the same man who gave us Tokyo Gore Police, which may give you the wrong impression about this movie.  Theres not much violence here, so please adjust your expectations accordingly.  On the positive side, there is one good death scene, the piano score is very effective, and the twist is somewhat surprising  but thats simply not enough to drive 60 minutes.  Go watch Rear Window again instead.",1494547200,,1430,4.7408906882591095
8667085,3,B00LO1T0HI,"This film appears to have been written by a 10 year old girl who does not yet understand how babies are made, or what a marriage is.  Nonetheless she imagines many angry scenarios about what it would be like to have a boyfriend or a marriage..  It's what she  would write if her favorite camp counselor was getting married. So...hilarious and surreal",1486598400,,350,4.612903225806452
