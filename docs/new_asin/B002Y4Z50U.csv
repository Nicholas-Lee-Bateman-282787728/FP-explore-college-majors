4011516,5,B002Y4Z50U,Somewhat dated exploitation black and white fun. With an unsettling unconvincing America in an English back drop setting. Boasting a strong British cast and US semi name it works. Tough sordid and slipping some stuff past the censor. I enjoyed every crummy moment of it.,1287705600,3,270,5.022222222222222
4011517,4,B002Y4Z50U,"Tudor-Alliance presents ""NO ORCHIDS FOR MISS BLANDISH"" (1948) (104 min/B&W (Dolby digitally remastered) --- This film contains much appreciated noir and good acting in Glorious Black & White --- Jack La Rue plays Slim Grisson with just the right balance of toughness and elegance, while Walter Crisham, MacDonald Parke and Lilli Molnar carve out their memorable portrayals as the other main baddies --- Linda Travers rounds off the cast in a sexy and very appealing squeaky-clean heroine who gradually learns that she likes it rough --- One of most passionate kissing scenes in an early film era --- As the film progresses the actors engage in their frequent snarling exchanges, and then the violent action kicks into gear, this takes the audience on a thrilling roller coaster ride -- loving every minute of it --- If you thought old British films from the 1940s were prim and proper -- better guess again, this film has sex and violence galore.

4011518,3,B002Y4Z50U,"My interest in this movie came in a roundabout way. I had purchased the DVD of 1971's ""THE GRISSOM GANG"" a while back for dirt cheap, and although I wasn't familiar with it, I'm a fan of the film's director, Robert Aldrich.  Going in with admittedly low expectations, I found the movie very enjoyable.  It has a couple of knock-out performances (Tony Musante, Scott Wilson & even Connie Stevens!), some great ""sick"" humour, and moments of gut-wrenching tension and ultra-violence.  The script was based on the best-selling 1940's novel 'NO ORCHIDS FOR MISS BLANDISH"", a world-famous sensation due to it's depictions of graphic sex and violence. It became equally controversial when filmed later in the decade.  A DVD was finally released in May 2010, so I now had the opportunity to see it. !!WARNING! THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS!!

  Although I've been quite pleased with discs from VCI Entertainment in the past, you never know if the material they have to work with is damaged beyond their control.  I was pleasantly surprised with how great the film transfer was.  The opening credits are over a montage of the title's ""orchids"" being prepared, transported and delivered to a mansion, where they go through 3 or 4 household staff to reach the titular lead character.  The razor-sharp B&W cinematography had hardly any noticeable damage.  At the end of the credits we are shown the card that came along with the orchids. It reads: ""Don't Do It!"", ""signed"" by a depiction of two dice.  We see Miss Blandish throw it in a jewelry-type box that contains quite a few more.  She then hands the orchids back to her French maid, and tells her to return them with the message ""No orchids for Miss Blandish...!""

  During the first half hour all the major characters are introduced, rich ice princess Miss Blandish (Linden Travers), her ill-fated sex-obsessed dipso fiance, a group of sick, twisted, vile and violent small-time hoods, and Ma Grissom (Lili Molnar) and her gang, a group of even sicker, more twisted, viler and lest we not forget MORE VIOLENT big-time hoods.  There's  suave, cool Eddie (Walter Crisham in an excellent portrayal), wily, erudite disgraced physician ""Doc"" (MacDonald Parke, also quite good) and  the obligatory ""big lug-head"" muscles-for-brains Flyn (Danny Green, wasted).  Everyone, that is except the lead male character, Slim Grissom (Jack La Rue), who is referred to constantly with a mixture of awe, terror, respect, danger and palpable fear.  Alas, this tension filled build-up to his eventual presence is what defeats the movie. Nothing that comes after can sustain that mood.  His entrance, and the events leading up to it, cause us to expect Slim to project an aura of sheer terror, but with his almost bored expression, and no notable feature to earn the sobriquet ""Slim"", Jack La Rue seems more like someone peeved that his sleep was disturbed than a dangerous, evil mastermind of crime.  Walter Crisham, as ""Eddie"" was not only physically slim, but also exuded an oily charm and dangerous air much closer to what you'd expect of a person with Slim's reputation, and when Slim walks into the room, sits down on a table, and pulls out two black dice (like on the cards sent to Miss Blandish) and begins obsessively tossing them over and over and over and over, I started to yell at the screen ""Enough already, I get it, I GET IT!""  I've yet to read the book, but this plot point is not in ""THE GRISSOM GANG."" The implication that Slim has always loved her from afar, was gallantly attempting to dissuade her from marrying a sex-crazed dipso and later the consequences of loving HIM just smacks of studio and censor interference. Whether it was Jack La Rue or director St. John Legh Clowes's fault, when the mostly soft-spoken, calm, sleepy-eyed Slim has to exhibit that dark evil side that causes everyone to be so paralyzed with fear, it's usually by losing his temper, mostly in childish tantrums. Then when he calms down, he apologizes to everyone!

  The rest of the movie becomes a genre exercise in the usual cliches, betrayals, greedy mistakes, giving it all up for love, etc., etc.  Maybe if this was made in the fifties by a good noir director, Preminger, Ray, Huston, Mann, etc., the results might have been more satisfying.  As is, though,""NO ORCHIDS FOR MISS BLANDISH"" is an interesting noirish artifact of it's day, and some of the violence, animal lust, threats of rape and sophisticated sexual situations are still shockingly contemporary.

The uproar merited a four-page article in LIFE magazine, titled, ""London Can't Take It."" Once the viewer gets used to the English actors attempting American accents (often with hilarious results) and misguided attempts at American gangster dialog (""You croaked him!"")it is actually quite a lively-paced and intriguing film.
