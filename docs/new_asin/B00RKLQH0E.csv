8695447,5,B00RKLQH0E,I'm so glad I purchased this video!  I have shared it at dinner parties with several friends who have all enjoyed it as much as I did. Annette tells an absolutely compelling story of a young wife following her husband to this epic battle. The rich history and raw emotions portrayed are unforgettable. The only thing better than watching this video is to see this performance live.,1469318400,,381,4.686567164179104
8695448,1,B00RKLQH0E,Absolutely horrible. It was a waste of money. I would give no stars but you do not have that option.,1459641600,,100,4.05
8695449,5,B00RKLQH0E,"Having visited Gettysburg, its battlefield, toured with a period actress, I have felt the incredible intensity of the conflict. I heartily endorse and urge people to view this moving presentation. You will experience a personal oral history of this period, one that will leave you with the feeling of an incredible conflict that pit family against family during a divisive chapter of our of our young country's growth and development. I recommend this viewing and purchase without reservation!",1434240000,,493,5.333333333333333
8695450,5,B00RKLQH0E,I was so impressed with the DVD of Witness to Gettysburg.  Annette Hubbell does an amazing job of bringing the character of Ms. Hattie Turner to life.  She helps you see what it was like to live during that period of time and makes you feel as if you are right there on the battlefield.  Witness of Gettysburg will be well worth your time!,1425600000,2,339,4.265625
8695451,5,B00RKLQH0E,"Witness to Gettysburg is a personal account of one specific period of our American history:  the Civil War.  The actress portraying Miss Hattie is also the researcher and the writer.  Taking the time to investigate the nuances of this period in time took months and the facts, tone and ""feel"" of the presentation brings those facts to life.

""Miss Hattie"" is a real person, and the presentation of the nuances of this period shows in the dress, the descriptions of life, the battlefield, and those participating--both in the war and in the life surrounding the war.  Factually accurate, ""Miss Hattie"" personalizes the horror of war, the needs of the time, the inventions and organizations created and the accomplishments of ""ordinary"" people doing the extraordinary.

In a world of the expedient, the quick and the recycled, this personal account of the tearing of the fabric that is the United States will provide grist for comparisons to values and attitudes today.  Storytelling is not really for the faint of heart for it conveys, when researched for accuracy, a deep description of the hearts of our ancestors, their reasons for action and their commitment to others.",1424390400,,1172,5.041450777202073
8695452,5,B00RKLQH0E,"I cried and laughed (yes there were some light-hearted parts) as this true accounting of the Battle of Gettysburg was told in amazing detail. I was glued to the performance as if I were there. Annette Hubbell brings the whole story to you as Ms Hattie Elizabeth Turner. How they took care of the wounded and the dead was extraordinary. The measures they had to take was unbelievable and could not be imagined..The terror of the battle was captivating and a lesson in history that I won't forget!! I recommend this film to anyone from middle school and beyond, and especially to history buffs. This is the greatest story of the battle of Gettysburg that I have ever seen or heard. Bravo, Ms Hubbell!!",1423958400,,699,4.645161290322581
8695453,5,B00RKLQH0E,"Witness to Gettysburg"" tells the story of the battle of Gettysburg in basically 4 parts. It starts with a brief history leading up to the start of the Civil War, the actual battle of Gettysburg, the aftermath of the battle and then some history of those who fought in the war. The story is told by ""Miss Hattie"" who witnessed and became a part of the events of Gettysburg. The first portions of the film (the start of the war and the battle) is information that I have heard before. What was new and very interesting to me was the aftermath of the battle; the destruction and impact on the town and the care of the wounded (and dead) soldiers. I had not seen or heard any of this information before. The film, which is an adaption of a play, is very well done. I think it would be excellent for school use for those studying the Civil War.",1423612800,,839,4.283018867924528
8695454,5,B00RKLQH0E,"I watched Witness to Gettysburg live and on DVD. I laughed and I cried as this true accounting of the Battle of Gettysburg was told in amazing detail. I was glued to the performance as if I were there. Ms Hattie Elizabeth Turner, who was portrayed by Annette Hubbell, was actually there from before the beginning of the battle until her life many years later and I felt I was actually there throughout the entire time. How they took care of the wounded and the dead was extraordinary. The measures they had to take was unbelievable and no one could ever imagine unless they were there. Annette Hubbell brings the whole story to you as Ms Hattie Turner, including every gory detail about caring and feeding of the wounded. Nothing is left to the imagination. The terror of the battle, as told by Annette Hubbell, was captivating and a lesson in history that will never be forgotten!! I recommend this film to anyone from middle school and beyond, and especially to history buffs. This is the greatest story of the battle of Gettysburg that I have ever seen or heard.

Please do yourself a favor and watch this great rendition of the most horrifying battle in our own United States of America....

Bravo, Ms Hubbell!!",1423440000,3,1215,4.6465116279069765
8695455,5,B00RKLQH0E,"We have all seen many shows that portray the Civil War from the battle perspective, but how about one from the eyes of a civilian? If you want to see how the Battle of Gettysburg affected an ordinary citizen - this is your piece. You have been led through General Lee's campaign and the Union moves but to see how the Civil War, and its battles (specifically Gettysburg) changed the lives of the townsfolk, you will be amazed. I have seen the show numerous times, live and on film, and am riveted each time, learning something new. A must see for any historian, Civil War buff or student. Ms. Hubbell's performance is stellar. She portrays Miss Hattie Elizabeth Turner as if she were born into the dress.",1423440000,,704,4.551181102362205
8695456,5,B00RKLQH0E,"""I am in awe! ...Annette Hubbell captured the Civil War wife and the wartime experience with her words, manner, dress and performance.

I cringed at the vivid pictures she creates in her writing; laughed at her humor; was intrigued by the life of women of that time and had to brush away the tears from the deep sadness of those days. She has eloquently used todays technology to bring Hattie,her experiences and the Civil War to life.

This is a must see for anyone interested in the Civil War. What a perfect tool for educators to bring the real picture of this terrible conflict to their students."" Maggie Potter",1423440000,,615,4.63302752293578
