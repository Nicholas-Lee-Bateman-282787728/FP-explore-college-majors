7865754,3,6304258755,"This Silent b&w film, based on L. Frank Baum's book ""Queen Zixi of Ix; or the Story of the Magic Cloak"" runs under 38 mins with some of the same cast from ""Patchwork Girl"".
The ACTUAL TITLE of this DOES NOT Have ""of Oz"", even though those words only appear once on screen.  The later scenes near the middle and end stray far from the book focusing on Nikkodemus the Mule rescuing a little girl named Mary from a bunch of robbers with the help from other animals.
  The first (almost) 15 minutes does follow the book closely (and quickly, with a few alterations and bits of scenes not in order):  The Fairies in the Forest of Burzee make the Magic Cloak and the Man in the Moon suggests them to give it to the first unhappy person they see, Aunt Rivette sees a vision of the father of Fluff and Timothy ""Bud"" dying at sea and so afterwards has to take them to the City of Noland with thier mule Nikkodemus, where the King has died and his Counsellors try to find a replacement.  Fluff gets the Magic Cloak which grants her wish and Bud is counted no. 47, making him the new King of Noland.  The next 10 or so mins is when the story uselessly differs: Nikkodemus the mule leaves Noland and is taken by 2 of several robbers who have also stolen a little girl named Mary.  Managing an escape, Nikkodemus meets the Zoop and Lion (those two are enemies) and the friendly crow and all the other animals, among them the Lion, tiger, Zoop, woozy, elephant, kangaroo, rabbit, etc to help Nikkodemus save Mary from the robbers and reunite her with her parents (who I think were rather stupid to keep on grieving and not to try looking for her!)  Getting back to the ACTUAL story, a minstrel tells Queen Zixi of Ix about the Magic Cloak, which prompts her to transform into a new maid for Princess Fluff in order to steal the Cloak, which will not grant her wish.  The Rolly-Rogues descend from their mountain and attack the City of Noland for soup.  (the remaining mins quickly resolve the story in fast pace)  Bud & Fluff ask for Zixi's help in regaining the Cloak to save Noland, and Nikkodemus returns to Noland with the other animals to save the City from the Rolly-Rogues - readers of the Dover Paperback edition of Baum's ""Queen Zixi ; Magic Cloak"" book will know of how else the short movie ends.  The Fairy Queen returns to take back the Magic Cloak, but only after she allows Bud to make his wish.
  It's a good thing this short movie isn't too long, but it's disappointing how the middle scenes differ from the book and take the longest to finish playing, even though a scene includes Bud and Fluff in a toy store buying toys appears from the book.  As said above, MUCH of the book is left out, like wishes from the other characters being granted, the actual defeat of the Rolly-Rogues, the longer search for the Magic Cloak, the full scene of Bud doing court is only mentioned briefly, further time with the characters' time in the castle, Zixi's other attempt at taking the cloak, her self-resolution and consoltation of her desire and quite a few others.  One other flaw, though not as major, is the naming:  Zixi is not only the name of the Witch Queen of Ix, but also the name of the skinny man, who is actually Jikki.  I did like how one of the people being counted entering Noland City looked like a Witch with a pointy hat, cape, long hair (and holding a cat?).  As before, the picture and editing is not thoroughly pleasing, with what should be focused usually out on the far edges of the screen, and also too close with little room for spacing and parts of the pciture with ""mistyness"" and fog-like puffs, while the editing has bits missing and not in chronological order = the cutting is scrappy and the picture viewing is crowded.  But then again it WAS 1915, so perfection can't be guaranteed, although the Selig Oz pictures of 1910 was certainly more enjoyable than this.
A Feature-Length Faithful Adaptation of L. Frank Baum's ""Queen Zixi of Ix; the Story of the Magic Cloak"" would most certainly be accepted in contrast to this 'nearly primitive' derivitive shooting.",1177977600,,4082,4.475741239892184
