8304717,5,B001GB1N1W,I am lucky enough to own one of the DVD's but I just bought two more for gifts. Although I personally have not had cancer...cancer touched my life when my mother was diagnosed with cancer.  She lived with the effects of radiation and surgery for 23 yrs. If only she could have seen the DVD. I personally was inspired by the participants and the art they created straight from their hearts. I am better able to cope with my own non-cancer health problems because I have seen how creativity can touch lives.  This video truly touched my life.  I can't say that about very many videos. The Aphodite Project is a blessing for us all...I am giving a copy to a friend whose father was just diagnosed.  Jo-Anne Blatter was a wonderful influence on the participants...but it's the participants who brought the movie to life.,1225238400,,816,4.606896551724138
8304718,5,B001GB1N1W,"I was in the Aphrodite Project and I'm proud to say ,I'm feeling fine and living not only with my cancer but also  with a passion to help everyone with cancer. I think this film is very honest and would let a cancer patient , that has just been diagnosed, know  it  is possible  to go on and lead a full life! Having the artists help us express our feelings was a wonderful idea and I think it is important for newly diagnosed patients to do just that. It is also an important film for family members and friends of cancer patients to see. I think they would get a different level of understanding that would benefit everyone. in the family!
All in all it is an film  that should be seen by every cancer patient! It It would also make a wonderful gift to give to a friend at the beginning of their cancer journey! I think JoAnne Blatter did a wonderful job!
