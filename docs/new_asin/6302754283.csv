7830419,4,6302754283,"The content of KINO's ODD & OUTRAGEOUS is superior HiFi and SP mode transfers of finely-preserved vintage animation. The Technicolor shorts in particular, although not as stylish as their more crude predecessors are of exceptional condition.

Included are such Van Beuren regulars as The Little King, the vocalizing duet of Tom and Jerry, Molly Moo Cow, Cubby Bear (an early rival of Mickey Mouse) and Felix the Cat. Conspicuously missing is Farmer Al Falfa.

One of the Tom and Jerrys contains offensive material: a dialect-singing quartet of big lipped black skeletons. For the most part though, this material is fairly innocent. The early b&w 'toons have the surrealism of Fleischer's work from the same years, but not their polish and fluidity, while the Technicolor stuff is smoothly animated but lacks pizzazz and is clearly aimed at children.

""Odd & Outrageous"" is a nice collection from an under-appreciated animation studio and a fine addition to any home cartoon library.
