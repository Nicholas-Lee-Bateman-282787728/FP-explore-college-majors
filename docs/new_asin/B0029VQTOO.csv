8358293,4,B0029VQTOO,"Early 80's softcore movie, starring the iconic Laura Gemser, of ""Black Emanuelle"" notoriety.  This one seems to be a cash-in on ""The Blue Lagoon,"" and like that film, features some gorgeous island photography and beautiful nude bodies on display.  Basically escapist fantasy, where an attractive guy fins himself stranded on a deserted island and discovers a beautiful Island girl, living there. The two are drawn to each other,but they are not alone on their dreamlike island. Her father, a violent and cruel old man watches over her, and sees the arrival of this stranger to be a threat to their secret existence.  Also present is her brother, who has been involved in an incestuous relationship with her, ever since childhood!  The movie is tasteful, and the erotic scenes are sexy without being overly explicit or crude.  Unfortunately this Region 1 dvd offers a terrible pan & scan transfer, with washed out color and awful sound. The quality is in fact, worse than what you would expect from an old VHS tape. For this title, you will have to look to Region 2 editions from Europe for a good quality print. For some reason this genre gets more respect overseas in terms of home video quality.",1521590400,,1197,4.819512195121951
