6498356,5,B00LPGIISE,Jodorowsky's best film! Has as much heart as it does fantastic imagery.,1410048000,,71,5.0
6498357,3,B00LPGIISE,"I would have never thought that I would only give 3 stars to any product coming from Jodorowsky.
I've seen all his movies and celebrated them again and again over the years since I saw The Holy Mountain in the late 70's.
I read most of his books even some that haven't been translated into english so far.
As well as all his comics. I first heard about this movie when I read the new book by the same title -which I greatly enjoyed - and ordered it right away.
First, the part covered in the movie is only his childhood in Chile and I thought the book greatly picked up AFTER that...
So to see that the movie was not the whole book (what did I think...) was a bit disappointing to start with....
Compared to his older movies I thought this was cheaply done with a lot of mediocre actors.
His son -who plays the father and the theosophist -was great and outstanding.
The music was lacking - again compared to his earlier ones where it was always fantastic...
Still, the message is good and it all comes straight from the heart and is better than most Hollywood stuff that one can waste his time with.
I will probably pass this on to somebody else.
If you are a fan you will certainly still enjoy it to a degree...",1409788800,5,1212,4.251082251082251
6498358,5,B00LPGIISE,"I can't say that I understand Jodorowsky's work, but I love it.  It's been a long time coming, but it was worth the wait. Moving and beautiful film. Brontis' acting is extraordinary.",1409529600,,182,4.6875
6498359,5,B00LPGIISE,"Great movie! Probably the most high production Jodorowsky movie to date, it has that 'digital' pristine look to it... but with all the heavy, surreal, imagery that you'd come to expect from a Jodorowsky film. Light years away from the usual Saturday-morning-cartoon-Hollywood trope movie. As with any other Jodorwosky film, this is a movie that aims to send you go through a inner voyage, an ego-melting experience, your views will be questioned, your sense of normality will be gladly challenged. It's refreshing to know that El Jodo is still challenging all the norms by making this kind of material. In this current digital age of bloated high-resolution commercial imagery that speaks to us like a child, Jodorwosky's movie brings back something that we will rarely ever see again. It saddens me that movies like this will become ever more rare, movies that go beyond the traditional narrative, not to impress you with some artsy, Hollywood-approved hipster, vapid, slickness, but with a sense of vision that actually ripples in reality. As much as this movie is biographical, it still maintains that human experience impact that most people have gone through. Excellence!",1409443200,14,1176,5.1947368421052635
6498360,5,B00LPGIISE,"The Dance of Reality marks Jodorowsky's first feature film in 24 years following The Rainbow Thief's failure back in 1990. Fortunately for us, The Dance of Reality is nowhere near the artistic monotony of its predecessor, for which our brilliant director was severely pressured not to change or add anything to the original script. This time, we're back in the greatness that has sparked Jodorowsky's most creative achievements (El Topo, The Holy Mountain, Santa Sangre), this time, it is 100% pure Jodorowsky material, made on his own terms. Jodorowsky is once again sharing his life and soul with us, through a very impressive autobiographical portrait of his childhood and his life as a child living with his parents in Tocopilla, Chile.

The movie is a continuous flow of beautiful, magical and sometimes surreal imagery that marked and defined Jodorowsky's most memorable moments as a child; learning about life, emotions, feelings, pain, and most of all, discipline and self-control. Jodorowsky's father, Jaime, is portrayed as a very severe man that doesn't show his emotions and wants his son to be just like him; a real man that works hard and doesn't show any signs of weakness. It seems that Jodorowsky went through a lot of hard times with his father when he was young. His mother, however, is portrayed as a very sweet lady that cares a lot for her son and encourages him to be himself without being ashamed. She understands, comforts, and listens to him, bringing about the proper parental balance for Alejandro, by giving him what his father is unable to, this is until he himself, leaves on his own journey away from his wife and son, in an attempt to rediscover himself.

Jodorowsky's theatrical and circus influence is still very present; clowns, freaks and other bizarre characters are seen all throughout the movie, reminding us of his previous 1989 chef-d'oeuvre, Santa Sangre. The cinematography is simply perfect, nice quality scenes with plenty of colors, unforeseen special effects and very effective use of lights, all combined in another unique Jodorowsky rollercoaster. Fans of his previous work will not be disappointed because Mr. Jodorowsky hasn't lost his touch at all. With unique characters, great acting performances, unpredictable twists and magical imagery, Jodorowsky has just signed one of his most outstanding work to date. As another reviewer mentioned, this one is for everyone, any religion, any culture. Free your mind, forget about Hollywood movies and enjoy the ride.

ENJOY!!!!",1409443200,27,2524,5.166259168704157
6498361,5,B00LPGIISE,"Just a way of say it, but this film is so poetic, so astonishing, so unexpected, that makes you think who you really are. Is not that like psychoanalysis? Yes, but years beyond. It uses the ""language of the dreams"". A language that the shamans and magic healers use in ancient cultures. This film is a piece of art, all religions, all cultures, all knowledge about the mind, tarot, archetypes, internal god and psychology are included.

It really can cure you, after watching it 3 times, my anxiety has slow down a lot, I can feel that I can be relaxed too, which is a big step.

A psychomagic movie. The movie itself is a psychomagic act. I recommend to watch it with friends or family, try to think differently this time about what you will watch. Is not a Hollywood movie, and don't expect that. A movie that shows you the universe that we are.",1409184000,38,847,4.423076923076923
6498362,5,B00LPGIISE,"I saw this movie 5 times in the theater. It was definitely Jodorowsky's most personal film to date. An amazing film with so much to take in. I cannot wait to get it on blu-ray and watch it over and over again. Definitely the best film of 2014.
All the actors were great, the visuals were great, the story line was great, It was perfection. A masterpiece.!
Some of the scenes may be difficult to watch which is a good thing. The discomfort makes you analyze a lot of things about yourself.",1407196800,35,488,4.315217391304348
6498363,3,B00LPGIISE,"At this stage I was a little disappointed with this movie, but still provided a lot of excellent acting and direction. I will watch it again and maybe on second viewing I will enjoy more.",1489449600,,187,4.371428571428571
6498364,5,B00LPGIISE,"AUDIO IS OFF FROM MOVIE SO BUY ELSEWHERE! It's a beautiful movie otherwise! Really humanistic and passionate! Loved it, but seriously, you do not want to watch it with messed up audio a full 8-10 seconds off from the movie.",1483315200,8,223,4.6
6498365,1,B00LPGIISE,"The movie is artsy, poetic, metaphorical, and off-beat. But the playback is very problematic. That's because, in Amazon Video, the closed-captioning is way out of synch with the audio. And that's just one issue. While I know how to turn on the closed-caption service on my device (Roku), this feature is not the same as one might expect to get with ""subtitles."" The movie's preview shows typical easy-to-read subtitles. But once rented, the movie plays without subtitles, and when the ""closed captions"" feature is selected, it plays with the quirky, out-of-synch CC text on screen. Has Amazon stopped offering standard subtitles in the traditional way, opting instead for the odd closed-caption service? Is this a problem with some movies and not others? I don't know, and there seems to be no way to ask the question to a human being in Amazon's employ. I'm now reluctant to rent non-English movies from Amazon. The subtitling problem is off-putting enough for me to begin researching alternative movie providers.",1483228800,8,1014,5.114457831325301
6498366,5,B00LPGIISE,"Alejandro Jodorowsky directs his son Brontis to play Alejandro's father in a memory film about Jodorowsky's excruiating, surreal boyhood in Chile.  To appreciate this disquieting film that borrows heavily from Eastern European post-modern theatre and minor dollops from Fellini's AMARCORD, please sense the arduous redemption of a cruel, misguided father within the short life span of a child.  A good many images are unforgettable, such as the boy caught in a funeral procession, the attack of a mob of deformed laborers, the final shot of death's ship leaving harbor carrying Alejandro Jodorwsky as an old man sidled by a carnival skeleton.",1480982400,,642,5.346534653465347

6498368,5,B00LPGIISE,"Excellent. One of Jodorowsky's best works. Unlike his other films which are more on the spiritual and artistic side, this film is more straight forward and strays away from more of his bizarre films. Though that's not to say that this film doesn't have those elements included as well. Check it out.",1475625600,,299,4.769230769230769
6498369,2,B00LPGIISE,"Despite some wonderfully surreal imagery, Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""The Dance of Reality"" (2014) is mired in maddening self-indulgence and gradually wears out its welcome. Slightly more accessible than the cult director's previous work, but not for all tastes.",1473724800,,258,6.0
6498370,5,B00LPGIISE,We dance to ignite the passion and grand illusion of divestment in reality. We move and swing into each other because we must lead we must create the agony and ecstasy of even attempting some illogical end point of perfection. It's never going to come yet we can't help ourself a into wanting to aspire to it's reach. We can't help but glow in the burning coals of are hearts the madness that consumes the ideals all encompassed into are potential that comes from a willingness to explore it with a deep seeding knowledge of being burnt by the tribe.

6498387,5,B00LPGIISE,"Currently my favorite film of all time! I will have to go back and watch his earlier work which I hated when it came out but this film has the wisdom of his entire 83 years and the story of his life (surrealistically rendered/remembered, acted by his three sons to give it indisputable depth and breadth). If you like the trailer . also watch the 4 minute interview trailer that give his background on apple and THEN if you are intrigued, watch this masterpiece.

6498426,4,B00LPGIISE,"When I watched 'The Dance of Reality', it answered many questions that I had when I watched 'Sante Sangre' (wow, has it been almost 25 yrs ago when I Sante Sangre??? It doesn't seemed all that long ago; at the same time, I was at a very, very different point/place in life-- figuratively & literally).

After watching Sante Sangre (for the 1st, 2nd & 3rd time), I wondered what it was like growing up as an Ashkenazi (Eastern European) in a predominantly Catholic, superstitious & xenophobic country such as Chile during the Shoah. In Sante Sangre (other films), the focus was on Catholic & Pagan iconography & themes. (As a young man, he identified as being Pagan & Pantheistic & belonged to a psychopomp multimedia performance group as a puppeteer & storyteller {which I strongly identified with as I was all of the above, with the exception of growing up in a Catholic & antisemetic environment- thank G-d}).

In Jodorowsky's other films, while they incorporate some autobiographical elements, didn't address his ethnic identity & growing up as a marginalized minority. The only reason I was aware that Alejandro/Alexandre Jodorowsy is Ashkenazi is because of his  name (& his children who were in his films) & subsequently read biographical works about him.

'The Dance of Reality' fills in gaps about Alejandro's psychology & youth, albeit through a magic realism style. As one who has seen many films & an appreciator of Jodorowsy's work, I discovered details about his childhood, from child abuse, antisemetism, being marginalised & growing up in an country riddled with superstition & a place that is ping-ponged between Nazism & Stalinist regime. (One note to keep in mind-- Ashkenazis who are Communist are typically Marxist & those who are socialist are 'Trotsky Jews', like my maternal grandparents & their generation who grew up in Montreal.  They are NEVER Stalin communists.)

It's important to be aware of the above biographical/historic aspects of the Jodorowsy's family (from Chaim & Sarah, Alejandro/Alexandre's parents to Jodorosky as child) in order to understand this film.

Some things to keep in mind when you watch 'The Dance of Reality':
1. The film follows a chronological structure, which helps viewers follow the film.
2. Other Jodorowsy films don't typically follow a chronological format; for this reason, 'The Dance of Reality' is one of his more accessible films.
3. Even though the film is predominately chronological, it isn't typically linear.
4. The film occasionlly meanders & goes into tangents; with this expectation, the payoff is worth the the patience of the viewer. If you expect a slightly surreal film with tight editing, you'll be disappointed. However, if you are familiar with Jodorowsky's films, you're not the typical film goer anyway.
5. 'T.D.o. R' isn't for the faint of heart:
  --There are some scatalogical scenes (one scene in particular is graphic),
  -- uncomfortable violence toward people w/disabilities,deformities, anomalies as well as Nazi violence toward Jews, gays, people w/congenital conditions, prostitutes as well as other marginalized peoples.
  --'death' of animals (implied rather than shown)
  --smothering/somewhat sexualised & inappropriate behaviour of a mother & son
  --violence toward children
However, the content drives the film & never feels gratuitous & exploitative.

If you have seen & appreciated Greenway's films (esp. The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover), Svankmajer's films & Herzog's The Tin Drum, you should enjoy this film.

My recommendation is to see 'The Dance of Reality' & then see 'Sante Sangre'. They are companion films & fill in the gaps of each film. You'll appreciate each film more when you watch both of them. Sante Sangre is worth purchasing along with The Dance of Reality.",1417392000,,3787,5.188834154351396

6498428,4,B00LPGIISE,"Great movie. But having read the book, this looks more as an attempt from Jodorowsky to pardon his father and reconciling his present with his traumatizing childhood... love it though, but incomparable with the book.",1416960000,,216,5.2
6498429,5,B00LPGIISE,"Some reflections I've been having lately about death...
I think a lot about the deaths of the artists I love and who are still alive. Because I am a greedy consumer, but also because I sympathize with the unavoidable artist's ambition for immortality in the form of a lasting legacy, I think especially, ""Will we receive more before that sad, sad, inevitable day?""
It's always surprising. William S. Burroughs hung on a long time without, to my mind, ever churning out a Great Last or even Great Latter Day work. Thomas Pynchon on the other hand...every time I count him out he churns out another piece that breaks new ground and that I (almost always) love right away. Some artists such as Hunter S Thompson or David Foster Wallace or Franz Kafka leave behind impressive, often incomplete works published posthumously.
And then there are those who just disappear. I'm thinking of Robin Williams here. Can you imagine what joy it would have been to have a wizened 90-year-old little Robbin poking fun at the undoubtedly bizarre realities we have in store down the road for us?
So what a relief, joy, and incredible fulfillment it is to have a genius like Alejandro Jodorowsky,--whose few-and-far between films have been compared, not unjustly I would say, to Shakespeare. For what did Jodorowsky create in El Topo if not a Hamlet for the post-modern world? Was Holy Mountain not a grand Tempest tale, Fando y Lis a Romeo & Juliet for the Post-Hiroshima world as seen from the eyes of the ""Global South"", and Santa Sangr a story of a Latin American McBeth, full of Mexican blood and Chilean brood and devouring himself in a Borges labyrinth where the Minotaur wears mighty Argentinean horns?--to have such a talent turn out a work so vibrant and true as The Dance Of Reality.
Knowing Jodorowsky, loving him, I was ready for anything. What I didn't expect was such a pure, stiff dose of Magical Realism. Why had I never drawn that connection before? Certainly, none of Jodorowsky's works up to now would fit comfortably next to a work of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and yet as though one great magician arriving by independent path and means upon the same enchanted grove where his late companion has just passed from this world, the great Tarot master Jodorowsky deals out a Maor Arcana of images that would fit perfectly into any GGM fiction.
Spoilers follow.
A corpse that hisses at a small child that there is no God.
A mother who never speaks but only sings extemporaneous opera, and who covers her son's naked body in shoe polish, when he is afraid of the dark.
A father who leaves his family behind and goes off to assassinate a dictator in his moment of greatest humiliation and pathos--weeping at the corpse of his most beloved horse--only to find his hands petrified into numb claws that never want to open again. The dictator offers the father two huge fistfuls of money to go away and never recall to mind again the terrible moment of defeat; when the tyrant rides off in his limo, the wind blows all the precious bills out of the crumpled fists that cannot shut. Then when the Nazis invade Chile, the failed assassin father, still totally estranged from his family, attempts to salute the incoming invaders but cannot straighten his fingers, and is publicly beaten, then tortured in private.
And the other thing I didn't expect.
Autobiography.
Yes, the boy is young Alejandro J himself, a part shared with the real Alejandro who appears, looking like an especially tired and yet extraordinarily alive Prospero, again and again at the young Alejandro's side, invisible to him, but holding him back at that crucial moment from falling off the edge of a sheer Chilean rocky overhang into the roiling tide below. No doubt a genuine memory, and a beautiful image of the future coming to the rescue of the past which, in its simplicity, strikes that exact spiritual bullseye that the El Topo era Jodorowsky, laden down with an immense arsenal of all the world's arcane symbolism and mythologic archetypes, sweated great Faust droplets of perspiration as he toiled down desert burrows and up steep edges of Holy Mountains, without ever having hope of reaching.
Will there be another pomegranate seed dropped in the great abalone shell of Jodorowski's grand opus (which includes not only films but novels and live performances and thousands of panels of comics, all of which I hope one day to have the opportunity of exploring) before he is gone? I certainly hope so, but this piece is so magnificent, and fits so well with the arc of all his films (probably including The Cravat and Tusk) that a Jodorowsky fan can't be blamed for walking away from this one with a truly rare and miraculous sense of completion.",1416528000,2,4711,4.78159509202454
6498430,5,B00LPGIISE,"Alejandro Jodorowsky returns after a twenty-something year absence in filmmaking with his fantastic autobiopic chronicling his early life in Tocopilla with a magical twist.

In Jodorowsky's second to previous picture (1989's ""Santa Sangre,"" one year prior to 1990's ""The Rainbow Thief"") Alejandro was chronicling all the dark energy around him in the world, exorcising it into a painfully depressing and yet beautiful film filled with horror and sadness-- ""Santa Sangre"" is a horror film in the truest sense of the word. But this time around, in ""The Dance of Reality,"" Jodorowsky chooses to take a bad situation (his childhood, as he put it) and 'rewrite it,' because it's important to know that 'the past can be changed.'

The film takes place in Tocopilla and tells two stories: One of Jaime Jodorowsky, Alejandro's abusive, atheistic and Stalinist father and his quest to assassinate Carlos Ibez-- where Jaime goes down a surprising spiritual path to salvation and the tale of young Alejandro, first at the hands of his terrible father, then on his own spiritual journey in the hands of his mystical mother, who speaks only in operatic vocals. What Jodo has done here is make the absolute best of a bad situation, he took all the anger and fear of his childhood and made it into something beautiful! It's a wonderful movie, and I'm tempted to say it's Jodorowsky's best to date, even over ""El Topo.""

As always, the direction is amazing, everything is meticulously prepared yet has an apparently random take, the acting never seems wooden or stiff, but natural and flowing like water. The use of colors is dazzling, especially on Blu-Ray! The music and sound is unlike anything I've heard in any other recent film and for such seemingly small movie it produces big emotion, evoked through metaphoric storytelling blended with autobiographical points of view. I particularly liked how Alejandro Jodorowsky played himself guiding himself as a child, how he was like a ghost from the future, as all things, past, present and future are connected.

""The Dance of Reality"" is a spiritual journey. It's the antithesis to the negativity and horror of ""Santa Sangre,"" as well as the antithesis to the cold modernity of widespread atheism-- I was touched how anti-religious Jaime was only to find salvation in the hands of a kindly person which leads him down a path to redemption. How much truth there is to the real story I do not know, but it's not important, it's a movie that shows that no matter what religion you follow, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Taosim, Hinduism or Buddhist or whatever, they're all part of the same Universal Consciousness, all things are connected and Jodorowsky plays that idea beautifully.

If you're a fan of Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, pick this one up immediately!",1416441600,,2797,5.019396551724138

6498433,5,B00LPGIISE,"Jodorowsky has created a brilliant masterpiece here! This directer has such an astounding point of view. This is what a visionary mastermind can do with a film, just blow your mind away and keep you begging for more.

When I first watched this my first feelings were YES, Jodorowsky has done it again. I think I may have been clapping my hands by myself! So thrilled to witness a new Jodorowsky film, and a very good one at that. Other first impressions were that I knew I would be looking over this film again very soon. Feel anxious to see it again. One of my most respected directors.

Open your mind to the world of JODOROWSKY. Strong recommendation to get this masterpiece film. If your new to this director, you'll want to see their other films also. No disappointments. Holy Mountain, El Topo, Santa Sangre.... ENJOY THE RIDE :)",1415836800,,835,4.597315436241611

6498438,5,B00LPGIISE,"This was not an easy film to watch, because of how emotionally direct it is. I had to take two intermissions. It's brutal, but at the same time it's incredibly tender. This film succeeds in healing a flawed male character instead of judging or emasculating him. It shows why men become troubled and how we can heal it and heal from it, and free ourselves from being trapped in a negative view of the world. The world is what it is, and through the power of our imagination, which is also reality, we can at least change ourselves so that we can move on. What I appreciated most about this film is the amount of humor in it, especially as the story intensifies toward its conclusion. The comedy is expertly blended with poignant moments of despair and horror, which keeps the positive tone of the film consistent throughout. It's not as existentially magnificent as El Topo or Holy Mountain, but it's more cohesive. It also deals with a theme that's more down to earth and personal than the others, which shows clearly that Jodorowsky wasn't trying to top his other films. It seems likehe made this film because he really had something to say, and he cared about it, and that's film making at its best. This is a film worth seeing, and worthy of standing right beside his other DVDs on my bookshelf.",1413331200,13,1298,4.551282051282051
