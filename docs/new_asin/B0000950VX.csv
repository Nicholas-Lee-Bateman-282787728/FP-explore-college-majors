This movie starts off akward and you might feel like you made a mistake in purchasing it but actually gets better as it goes. You can almost see the first time director learn how to make a film as the movie progresses. odd, unbalanced shots give way to much better ones and the mise-en-scene, although way over the top is almost clever at times. You will laugh at times at mistakes, some bad acting and silly dialog but that happens when you are a newbie to film plus he shot it in michigan, its hard to find a good cast and crew in so. cal sometimes, i can only imagine the difficulty out there!! I really wanted to give this  4 but the production quality does hurt it.  So if you wanna watch a straight forward movie about a crazy dude who starts hackin' up people, i say go for it! And look out for bruce campbells cameo's.........",1058659200,,1063,4.31

7989467,1,B0000950VX,"Wow, read some of the bad reviews here on amazon and couldn't have said it better myself. I just felt the need to confirm all those previous negative comments because I felt this movie was an insult to my intelligence. It's a cliche love story minus the engaging drama meets a cliche serial killer movie minus the quality gore and with the look of some really bad late 90's tv show that begged for cancellation. Don't believe the hype just because Bruce Campebell's name is on it. Also, apparently it took 9 years to make this, wtf?!?!",1311897600,,535,4.525773195876289
7989468,3,B0000950VX,"When I first sat down with Michael Kallio's film ""Hatred of a Minute,"" I expected yet another piece of ultra low budget sludge. You see, I've spent far more time than I should watching DVDs from companies like Sub Rosa and other bottom of the barrel distribution companies that put out shot on camcorder crud like ""Shatter Dead,"" ""Peter Rottentail,"" and other dreck. My opinion of the film changed somewhat when I noticed that Anchor Bay oversaw the film transfer and released the disc. That's always promising. Then I noticed none other than veteran ham Bruce Campbell was involved with the production. That's even more promising. When I started watching the movie and noticed that Kallio actually used real, honest to goodness film stock instead of Mom and Dad's camcorder, I thought I might really be on to something. Here's a guy trying to make an entertaining film on a miniscule budget, a veritable modern day Herschell Gordon Lewis or David Friedman. Well, the budget isn't that small, and the gore isn't of the type you would see in ""Blood Feast"" or ""The Wizard of Gore."" But the movie isn't terrible, and that's saying something when it comes to these low budget horror flicks.

""Hatred of a Minute,"" a title that apparently comes from a very short poem written by Edgar Allan Poe, tells the story of one Eric Seaver (played by Kallio himself). We quickly learn that Seaver is a vicious serial killer, a monster who preys on helpless women whenever the urge comes over him. In a series of flashbacks told as a story to one of his victims, Eric recounts the events that brought him to this sorry state. It all started with a childhood spent in an abusive home. Seaver's mother Linda (June Munger) made a colossal mistake when she married an alcoholic, physically imposing thug by the name of Barry (Gunnar Hansen!). The movie treats us to numerous scenes of Barry's violent binges, binges in which he mercilessly pummels both Linda and Eric. Even worse, he accompanies the attacks with barbaric, slurred insults that permanently affect our protagonist. To seek refuge from the beatings and emotional abuse, Eric withdraws into his own mind. He's still doing that in the present, too, carefully hiding his pain from those around him, especially his fiance Jamie (Tracee Newberry) and his best buddy Detective Glenn Usher (Tim Lovelace).

Seaver's carefully constructed faade, propped up with his work as a transcriber of autopsy reports and his hopes for his screenplay, cracks and falls away after his mother Linda dies. The funeral brings Eric into contact with Barry, thus dredging up all the horrific memories of abuse years before. His stepfather tries to reconnect with his stepson, describing how he quit drinking and has turned his life around. Seaver doesn't want to hear apologies; he's regretful that he couldn't save his mother from the abuse, he's angry about it, so he decides to kill Barry with a toaster. He also decides that he can now save other women from abuse by murdering them. And so he proceeds to liberate female souls in the most brutal ways. Unfortunately for Eric, his activities occupy quite a bit of time, thus making his fiance and his best friend suspicious that he might be the guy behind the sudden spate of killings. Moreover, Eric suffers hallucinations in which he sees an angel named Michael (Jeffrey Steiger) and a demon called Jack (Michael Robert Brandon) appearing from time to time to battle over his soul. He'll either have to turn himself in or follow his path to self-destruction.

""Hatred of a Minute"" has a few good things going for it. I liked the somber, dark atmosphere of the film even though the idea of a tormented serial killer has been done to death over the years. I also enjoyed seeing Gunnar Hansen and Bruce Campbell in small parts--although Campbell's presence is limited to some old footage of his television work playing on Jamie's tube towards the end of the film. I'm very impressed Kallio decided to use film stock, not VHS tape, to make his movie. I wish more filmmakers would shell out the extra cash and put their vision on celluloid. What I didn't like about the movie are problems inherent in almost any small budget production. The acting is uniformly banal, especially Gunnar Hansen's turn as Barry. His death scene is actually unintentionally hilarious due to his poor performance. I'm also not sure Kallio should have played the lead character. He's not bad in the role, but surely someone else might have done a better job. Bad dialogue and cheap production values also plague significant parts of the picture. Despite the flaws, ""Hatred of a Minute"" is still light years ahead of most of the junk I've watched over the past couple of years.

The extras on the disc are overwhelming. We get two commentary tracks, one with Kallio and Campbell and one with Kallio and sound designer Joel Newport. We also get a bunch of deleted and extended scenes, outtakes, a poster and still gallery, and behind the scenes footage. The DVD even contains a recording of Kallio and Bruce Campbell premiering the movie in Royal Oak, Michigan. That's a lot of stuff to watch! I'm not sure the movie merits such bounteous supplements, but they do give the viewer some good insights into the trials and tribulations of low budget filmmaking. It took Kallio NINE years to finish this film. He ought to get some sort of an award for sticking it out and realizing his vision. ""Hatred of a Minute"" isn't great, but it's a capable film that shows the Michael Kallio has some talent. I'd watch another one of his films.",1129766400,,5575,4.798126951092612

7989470,5,B0000950VX,"""Hatred of a Minute"" is a hauntingly beautiful film.  Anybody interested in film should not miss this movie.  You follow the path of a serial killer, Eric Seaver, and the twisted thoughts that drive him.  Violent scenes put it into the horror genre but much of the gore was toned down and leaves the viewer focusing more on the psychology of the film.  Sound, light, shadows, and color are all altered and enhanced to enrich the quality of the cinematography.  The acting is very strong in comparison to the hackneyed performances usually observed in horror films.  Also watch for shout outs to the film's producer, Bruce Campbell, as well as to the film ""The Evil Dead.""",1073001600,3,671,4.741379310344827
7989471,4,B0000950VX,"A funny thing happened to me today at Best Buy while browsing for DVD's.  As I flipped through the many titles, I came across this film, ""Hatred Of A Minute"" and I see the name Mike Kallio. My nostalgic brain started turnin' ... where do I know this name?
I used to party with this guy  back in high school! It was crazy because I remember Kallio telling me about his movie plans and we had a blast bullsh*tting about the Evil Dead  and how WE would make our horror films. The fact that Bruce C is in his movie is unreal!! I mean, we talked about that!
To find out that Mike Kallio has a movie in Best Buy is classic! I don't know too many people in the biz... but I can say that I knew this guy. The least I can do is buy the flick and support him for living his dream. I always knew this guy could do it. After watching it once, I was a bit  scared of Kallio as a brutal creepy killer... I thought, man, he was a always so cool and chill.  His acting freaked me out.
All in all, I thought it was a trippy popcorn flick with tons of old school horror shout out's with an edgy twist. I give the film props and the fact that Kallio did what I remember him saying he was going to do... speaks volumes.
As I did a google search to find out more about the movie, it lead me here to Amazon.  Then, I read some of the reviews and I was laughing at the intensity of some of them!
What's the deal with some of these people ripping it apart like it was supposed to be Lord Of The Rings? Talk about HATER'S of the minute!
Almost all of the comments seem to be from film geeks who seem to be hating Kallio's version of fun. Horror IS fun and movies are just an escape for a little bit.  Why the hell are these people buying or renting Independents and comparing them to other Independents? Isn't the whole point of Independent filmmaking supporting the movement?
Everyone's got an opinion and you can't make everyone happy when your a HATER.  If you reviewers Hated it so much, why did you spend an hour out of your day ripping it?
I'm not much for reviewing every frame of the movies I watch... I try to enjoy them for what they are.  Except for the movie goer Blood 66 (I don't want to type the third six) the comments seem to be from HATERS. I wonder what George Lucas felt like when people HATED the little kid in the newer Star Wars!!! Bad reviews are part of the game. I hope Kallio laughs them off and thanks these people for their support!!!
If your checking your reviews Mike, congrats on you selling your movie and making people buy it or rent it with a great title and a true follow through on your passion. The commentary track was cool. Good Luck with your next movie and tell Bruce C that he rocks!
To all those who read this review... check out the movie and have fun with a good guy's first flick. Just remember all the ""greats"" had first movies too and this one is right up there with some of them. Cause in ten years I predict Kallio will probably sit back in his phat screening room with a cold beer in one hand and a stogie in his other... thinking about the accomplishment of his first film and how the journey is far more satisfying than the destination.
DON'T HATE THE HATRED!",1070928000,6,3188,4.120772946859903
7989472,5,B0000950VX,"Jeez,.. the last reviewer is a lame-o. So, you didn't like this guy's movie. We get it. Get over yourself and find a hobby. I actually liked the film. It ain't academy award material but, whatever. There are alot worse movies out there. I met Mike Kallio at a screening at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood in June (2003) and he was a very nice guy. He knows his movie is't the best but, he GOT IT DONE! That takes alot of drive and determination. Where's the last reviewer's movie,.. OH WAIT! He probably doesn't have one. I gave this movie 5 stars because I wish I could make a film and this guy had the guts to spend 9 years on his dream. Don't be a lame-o like the last guy,.. The commentary with Bruce Campbell and Mike Kallio is worth it (Very imformative if you want to be in the business). Check it out,.. It's a creepy little film.",1068940800,5,840,4.22360248447205
7989473,1,B0000950VX,"Oh dear sweet Jesus, Mother Mary of God, this movie was horrible. Were I to extract everything I hated from the worst horror movies I've ever seen, and then kneaded those qualities into a gigantic nasty doughy blob, the result would be THIS movie. Offhand I cannot recall any other movie that I disliked this much; this movie was easily seventeen rungs below Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.

Can your heart stand the fright? Eighty-four minutes of rambling melodramatic high school crap---a process laden with pompous Poe references and Biblical jibes. What garbage. I don't care if this movie was independent or not; I've seen GOOD independent films. Contrary to obtuse consensus, when one renders an opinion of a horrible movie, the source of the opinion is not in fact a ""wannabe""; this is the kind of circular weak-kneed logic, I suspect, that spawned a movie such as this one in the first place.

Within three seconds I disliked the main character: a pudgy avatar of everything that is foul and bilious in the composition of the contemporary clich. He trolls around huffily with his girl's haircut trying unsuccessfully to impersonate a scary movie character. Apparently, as revealed via flashback, this guy's daddy used to lock in him a closet; over time this horrible, horrible, horrible traumatic experience has crystallized into a compulsion to ambush and murder unsuspecting women.

The main character spends a good deal of the movie walking around and arguing with his hallucinatory bald companions. He deliberately walks into bars, malingering until people notice him just so he can subsequently tell them to go away and leave him alone. Surprisingly, he actually has friends---a number of pallid secondary characters apparently thrown in specifically to put up with the main character's general petulance and sophomoric tantrums. Ultimately, he shoots himself, and while this action is merciful to everyone involved, it could have easily been accomplished in one minute as opposed to eighty-four.",1067212800,5,2008,5.2105263157894735
7989474,1,B0000950VX,"This film, despite having the names Bruce Campbell and Gunnar Hansen in it, is very flawed to say the least.  Being made on a low budget, I could forgive the poor production values, but there is no excuse for the terrible acting, poorly written dialogue, and multiple truely dumb scenes.  The dvd's insert has the director writing of his making of the film and he mentions how he studied films and got very much into horror.  Well, the filmmakers didn't learn a thing from all those films they supposedly watched.
The main character is the villian whom we are supposed to identify with.  As a boy, he witnesses the abuse of his mother from a drunk stepfather.  Then we fast forward to him as an adult and he suddenly looses it; just like that.  No mentioned history of fighting, foster homes, abusing children, abusing animals, lighting fires; things that serial killers do/go through before their killing sprees begin.  I know I sound anal with all this, but at least I took the time to research the subject matter; something these filmmakers didn't do.  Yes, other movies don't mention these things about their serial killers either (Frenzy, American Psycho, Switchback), but they don't attempt to make their audiences sympathize with these characters by showing us their terrible past. If the director wanted his audience to sympathize with his main character, he should have took lessons from the film Peeping Tom.  The director should also consider the following low budget films:
_ Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane
_ A Better Place
_ El Mariachi
_ Deadbeat At Dawn
Although the acting may be ameteurish in some of these titles, it is compensated with clever dialogue, humor, good plots, very well staged action scenes, good make-up special FX (all of which are lacking in Hatred of a Minute).",1061683200,5,1797,4.865573770491803
