5054225,1,B0074JOCMC,"Amazed that people are giving 5 star reviews for something they haven't even seen, I've watched the first two of the four episodes and find the whole thing tedious and extremely disappointing. I have a passion for all things 'Titanic' and was really looking forward to this series, but it's more like a soap opera afloat than a dramatisation of the most famous maritime disaster. Although some of the effects are very good, part of the first episode appeared to be filmed in the living room of a Victorian house, rather than the first class lounge of the largest liner the world had seen at that time. Scant mention is made of the causes of the disaster, just a few throw away statements about the lack of lifeboats, use of iron instead of steel rivets, missing binoculars and a ""there's been some ice warnings"". Although it has been made out to be telling of the story without distractions, (no 'Rose and Jack), it's more 'Downton Afloat' a soap opera all at sea. If at all possible try to view it before buying the DVD, it may well be your sort of thing but for me it's a wasted opportunity to make a definitive drama. UPDATE- having now watched the 3rd episode, I can only say it has got even worse,  In fact I've now given up on it, if you have any knowledge about Titanic, or are any sort of fanatic on the subject I would advise you to give this rubbish a miss, Apart from the ships crew, none of the characters it follows ever actually existed and the causes of the disaster are passed over 'in the blink of an eye' it truly is just a soap opera on board ship.",1333324800,44,1567,4.348122866894198

 THIS IS AMAZON'S ENGLISH EDITION.EXTRAS ARE NOT CONFIRMED ON THE AMERICAN EDITION.

Titanic is a four-part serial created by BAFTA-winning producer Nigel Stafford-Clark (Warriors; The Way We Live Now; Bleak House) and written by Oscar and Emmy winner Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park; Downton Abbey) to mark the hundredth anniversary of the world's most famous maritime disaster in April 1912. It sets out to tell the story not just of a single ship, but of an entire society--one that was heading towards its own nemesis in the shape of the First World War as carelessly as Titanic towards the iceberg.

This world, soon to vanish forever, is brought alive by a cast of over 80, featuring the cream of acting talent from Britain and beyond, including Linus Roache (Law & Order; Batman Begins), Geraldine Somerville (Harry Potter; Cracker), Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones's Diary; Kingdom), Toby Jones (My Week with Marilyn; Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy; Captain America), Maria Doyle Kennedy (The Tudors; The Commitments), Perdita Weeks (The Promise; The Tudors; Lost in Austen), Jenna-Louise Coleman (Waterloo Road; Emmerdale), Steven Waddington (Sleepy Hollow; Last of the Mohicans), Lyndsey Marshal (Hereafter; Being Human; Rome), Ruth Bradley (Primeval), Peter McDonald (The Damned United; City of Vice) and Timothy West (Bleak House; Ever After; The Day of the Jackal) amongst many others.

All human life is on Titanic as she sets out on her maiden voyage. The upper-class family with their suffragette daughter and their warring servants; the wealthy elite of American society; the Irish lawyer in Second Class with his embittered wife; the young cabin steward and the impetuous Italian waiter who falls for her; the Catholic engineer fleeing Belfast with his wife and family to escape the sectarian conflict; the mysterious stranger in Steerage fleeing who knows what. And then there are the officers and crew. As their stories interweave and we find our first impressions are often undermined by what we learn, there is one thing that we know for certain and they do not--that not all of them will survive.

The Curse of the Titanic Sisters

They were conceived and created to become the world's biggest, grandest and safest ocean liners: three super liners--The Olympic, Titanic and Britannic--launched and sold as the ships that would never sink. But despite this boast all three were involved in maritime disasters soon after launching. And two of the three--Titanic and Britannic--were lost forever in the most dramatic of circumstances.

This one hour film investigates the doomed history and flawed design of the three White Star Liners, from inception to disaster. And it launches a new forensic examination of the wreck of the Britannic, designed to be both bigger and grander than the Titanic. Britannic was the last of the three sisters to launch and extensively modified in the aftermath of the Titanic loss, in order to make sure, unlike her sister, she would prove truly ""unsinkable"".

Yet Britannic was lost in 1916 following a mysterious explosion. On a calm sea and under a clear blue sky, she sunk three times faster than her infamous sister Titanic, despite all her extra defenses.

By exploring areas deep inside the massive interior of the Britannic, compartments unseen and undisturbed since the day of her sinking, incredible new evidence is revealed to prove what caused the initial explosion and why the doomed ship disappeared beneath the waves so fast. And in doing so new light is thrown on exactly why the three ships created to rule the waves--Titanic, Olympic and Britannic--were actually doomed to fail from the moment their plans were first drawn up.

5054248,3,B0074JOCMC,"This ""movie"" if you can call it that, is in four parts, each part lasting about 45 minutes (though the final part may have been longer- it seemed to be).  The acting isn't bad, and the sets are acceptable, but many scenes are repeated throughout the individual parts.  Instead of telling the story of the Titanic disaster in the usual sequence, it is depicted from the viewpoint of the various characters, which is the reason for all the rehashing.

Some viewers may appreciate this approach, but it left me a bit bored as the plot seemed scattered.  In all, this is one of my least favorite Titanic-related movies of the several I've seen so far.  Unless you pay close attention while watching, the story-line seems all over the place and can quickly become confusing and difficult to follow.",1495756800,,793,4.717391304347826

5054253,3,B0074JOCMC,"Far from great, but not awful.  The familiar big story told through smaller, more personal ones.

Production values were high, but the camera did not dwell up on the large picture.

Some in comments mention the the annoying repeats shown from previous episodes.  Actually these were not ""repeats"" -- but a covering of previously shown events form a different perspective.  Quite clever story telling IMO. But perhaps they worked better when the episodes were seen on different nights -- not one following the other as I, and I expect many others did, when viewing these discs.

Overall I was glad to see this. No truly ""new"" ground covered, but the Titanic disaster still makes for powerful drama.",1489017600,,697,4.914529914529915

5054295,2,B0074JOCMC,"The only thing this movie has going for it is spectacular special effects.  MRS Bunkermeister read A Night to Remember, The Night Lives On and the Official Transcript of the Titanic Investigation and we watched eight ""Titanic"" movies in a row and then visited a local Titanic museum in September, 2015.  This was the last of the movies we watched.  The female lead and her boyfriend run off to have illicit sex in the hold of the ship.  Two men are searching for her when the ship hits the iceberg and they are killed.  The woman is engaged, but is too greedy and weak willed to break off her engagement with a wealthy man she does not love.  She was willing to steal from him, taking a valuable jewel; a theft that is blamed on her boyfriend. Later her fiancee and her boyfriend put her in a lifeboat, but she later gives up her seat, leaving the boat to descend to the water with a space that could have been given to another woman had she only refused to get in the boat.  Another death on her conscience, if she had one.  Once again she meets up with her boyfriend who stays with her to the end and dies a horrible death in the water.  She is saved at the last moment and lives to a ripe old age, engaging in a life of narcissism and self indulgence.  Her boyfriend was an artist.  She kept the stolen jewel, rather than use it to found an art school or provide scholarships for indigent artists in his memory.  Eventually, she simply tosses the priceless jewel into the deep Atlantic.",1444262400,,1489,4.335740072202166

5054297,4,B0074JOCMC,"I'm apparently one of the few people that actually enjoyed this movie.  I think that part of why I really liked this is I didn't hear much about it before I watched it.  A lot of the complaints seem to be from people who were let down after hearing all the hype.

Unlike the James Cameron version, we're not distracted by a made-up, unrealistic, puppy-love romance.  There's no ""heart of the ocean"" garbage or sappy theme song.  We're simply shown the event of the sinking through the perspective of four different groups of people.  And in the setting of 1912, 4 VERY different groups of people.  I really have to object to the complaints about jumping around and things being too hard to follow.  You just need to pay attention.  Yes, there are a lot of people to keep track of, but the movie is trying to cover a lot of people in actually not a lot of time.

Before I watched this, I didn't realize that this movie made claims to be more historically accurate than others.  And again, maybe reviews didn't agree with this.  I don't really see how this can even be commented on since a lot of the facts regarding the sinking aren't even addressed.  As someone who has been intrigued by the sinking for quite some time, I did notice several key points.  For example, there is evidence that suggests the last song played by the band before she sunk was ""Autumn"" and not ""Nearer my God to Thee"" as shown in the James Cameron movie.  While we'll never know for sure, I did appreciate the noticeable difference.

Yes there are inaccuracies, yes it can feel like Downton Abby on a ship, and yes it wasn't given a blockbuster budget, but if you approach this movie with a fresh mind, I think you can really enjoy a fine piece of writing.",1432598400,,1732,4.4335443037974684
5054307,5,B0074JOCMC,I personally think this edition is better than the one with leo dicaprio.  I didn't like that one because of the sappy love story took over the whole movie. I like to just see the people as many rather than just two.  this is a good movie for a television based movie.  its very good.,1431648000,3,284,4.127272727272727

5054330,3,B0074JOCMC,"I was a little disappointed by the sequencing of the story.  Would have been better if it did not keep going back to the beginning to pick up the stories of all characters.  This creates confusion when viewing, because you think you hit the wrong button on the remote. and search for the correct place until you realize what the writers are doing. And a lot of the main characters with which we are all familiar, were not brought to light in this version, despite the longer run time.  I love all Titanic movies especially ""A Night to Remember"".  So if you also love Titanic movies, this may well disappoint. The story could have been a bit longer and have gone into more depth on the building of and the shortcuts taken by the builders, which caused this tragedy.

5054335,4,B0074JOCMC,"Can you get enough of the Titanic story, both in drama & documentary format?  I can't.  How many non-military events in history have commanded such interest 100 years after the fact?  In my hometown (Winnipeg, Canada) there's an old building I pass as I go on my frequent walks to the bank.  In a dusty window there hangs a picture of a guy who went down with the Titanic--a well-to-do guy who made a fortune speculating in real estate.  Indeed, his name was Mark Fortune.  I become wistful as I study his picture, contemplating the irony of his life & the lives of his fellow victims who at first were very happy to have the opportunity to sail on the ship, but then very much regretful a few days later.  Such is the enduring power of the Titanic story.

* * * * * *

I thought this was OK.  The CGI rendering of the ship was convincing; the acting was above-average; the costumes, sets & props were great.  However, I took exception to the excessive use of lighting.  What is it with Julian Fellowes & lighting??  I don't know if one can blame him entirely, but given his stature in the industry I presume he has clout over many aspects of production.  It reminded me of the excessive lighting in Downton Abbey.  Every scene was just too damn bright.  I find that annoying.  For instance, with reference to the actual event, I doubt very much that in the Atlantic Ocean in the dead of night--indeed, on a moonless night--the scenes in the lifeboats around the sinking ship were as bright as those depicted in this mini-series.  Yeah, I'm not stupid--I hope.  I understand that we gotta see the actors & what they're doing.  But why not use subdued lighting instead of super-bright fluorescent lights?  I think that would be more realistic; it would give the movie more credibility.  The viewer wouldn't be constantly reminded that he was watching a movie.  (In the case of a really good production, the viewer forgets that he's watching a movie.)  The impending iceberg collision scene was totally unrealistic.  I don't think the ship's crew saw the iceberg a scant 10 seconds before collision.  They probably never saw it coming to begin with.  And maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought that in the movie the officer shouts ""turn starboard hard"", or something like that.  Then the ship moves to the left of the iceberg.  Strange.  Each of the 3 last parts of the series was essentially a repetition of part 1, albeit from a different perspective.  Yeah, the camera angles & character focus were different, but each of the four parts tells the same story from the perspective of different characters.  Still, I would have preferred linear continuity with no flashback-like repetition.  This is basically a 46-minute movie told 4 times.

Notwithstanding my caveats, I would recommend this.  Especially if you can get it cheap.  (I paid less than 6 bucks for it.  Not bad.)  I find that a good test of the worth of a movie or series is whether or not I'd watch it repeatedly.  For examples, I can't get enough of The George Sanders Saint Movie Collection&nbsp;]; The Falcon Mystery Movie Collection, Volumes 1&nbsp;] & 2&nbsp;]; The Complete Thin Man Collection&nbsp;]; etc.  I watch those series 3 or 4 times a year.  Not to mention my beloved A & C&nbsp;].  Great stuff.  Will I wanna watch Fellowes' Titanic that often?  Alas, probably not.",1410739200,,3340,4.664948453608248

5054365,4,B0074JOCMC,"Of course my very favorite movie about Titanic is the old B&W version with Barbara Stanwyk and Clifton Webb.  There has never been anything to touch the emotion of that movie.  I never cared for the Cameron version except for the parts about discovering the Titanic.  I thought Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio were both miscast.  This 4 part TV version is very well done.  It takes a bit of getting used to when each episode starts back at the beginning and tells a story of a different set of characters with all episodes ending when the ship is sinking.  Only the 4th episode shows the actual sinking and lets you know who survives and who dies.  The acting is excellent, the script well written.  One huge error in the script is the man on the bridge saying ""Iceberg right ahead"".  They would never have done that as right indicates to the right.  ""Dead ahead"" is the correct phrase.  And, in every other thing I've seen or read it was Mr. Ismay who  insisted on the speed while in this version it is the captain who hasn't the sense God gave a goat and with all his years of experience should certainly have known better.  It is, as are all Titanic movies, a study of the class distinctions present during that time, that some people thought that they were just better than others,  and the pride and arrogance that made them think they could actually build a ship that could not be sunk. It's enjoyable and I recommend it. BTW, the added features are very good. They are all on disc 2.  All of the movie is on Disc 1.",1399507200,,1525,4.396428571428571

5054393,3,B0074JOCMC,"I toyed with giving this series two stars, but settled on three. This is a turn of the 20th Century ""costume"" drama about the building of the Titanic. The second season was to be about its sailing and sinking. The computer graphics are lovely and the characters are compelling. Its strongest suit is the attention it pays to the history of the labor movement in Belfast and the sectarian conflict emerging with it.

Unfortunatley  the filmmakers took major liberties with the historical background. For example, the series depicts Titanic being built alone at the Gantry at Harland  and Wolff Shipbuilders, when in fact Olympic and Titanic were built side by side. Olympic was started three month before Titanic, but they stood dramatically together in the shipyard during most of the project. Most jaring to me was the climactic sailing of Titanic from Belfast, when Titanic in fact sailed with it passengers from Southampton, England. Especially because the writers are making a controversial point about the underlying cause of the sinking, attention to detail is critical. These were careless and non-trivial errors which undermine the credibility of the series. Not quite a waste of time, but close.",1379808000,2,1204,5.13265306122449

Not to mention, I loved the way the put the spin on the ""Elite upper class passengers""  and the ""Lower class and workers""...just like Downton Abbey"". Let's face it, we all know the Titanic sank, so ultimately, story over.

5054415,1,B0074JOCMC,"It is no small feat to make the sinking of the Titanic a bore.  Writer Julian Fellowes has managed it.  Our imaginations are never drawn into the enduring fascination of this well-worn story as it receives yet another retelling.  Pity.  One would have thought that with Fellowes at the helm--he being a preeminent expert on all things Edwardian, of which the Titanic was the epitome--that this production would have been unforgettable.

He fills the ship with fictional characters, and dull ones at that.  Who needs 'em?  The spell of the Titanic endures after a century because of the heady mix of real-life travelers on board who were suddenly thrown into life-and-death circumstances that we all, with a shudder, can imagine ourselves confronting.  No fiction writer has ever been able to improve on what actually happened that night, and the people it happened to (and I include James Cameron).  The acting is good, but I just didn't care about the invented characters and their cliched problems that Fellowes has concocted.

But far more fatal (pun intended) to the drama is that fact that the spectacle of the sinking itself is continually interrupted with shifting time frames, giving no sense of the growing desperation of the passengers and crew.  With this fragmented approach to juggling the characters' stories, the suspense never builds.  We all know the outcome.  The intrigue lies in watching individuals on board grasp what has happened, as they face the dawning realization that the seemingly invincible Titanic is in fact sinking, and soon.  Fellowes' structure, jumping about in the chronology of the story, totally disrupts and dissipates this spellbinding sense of unfolding tragedy.  The allure of the Titanic's tale will always be in its breathless, ""You are there"" retelling, not in a staid GRAND HOTEL-style history lesson.

Some of the special effects are worth a look.  The viewer gets a sense of how the luxury liner that sank with mind-boggling gymnastics in the middle of a clear night on a placid sea must have looked at points in her death throes.  But probably only Titanic buffs will find it worth enduring the rest of the dreck.

I weary of yet again seeing the Titanic saga portrayed as a sudsy episode of class warfare.  That overplayed aspect of the calamity diverts viewers from far more elemental truths about the human condition that the story contains--truths that I suppose are referenced in two other words often used to summarize the event:  tragedy and fate--which compel more interest than privilege and snobbery.  Out of tragedy and fate, Ancient Greek playwrights wrought terror and catharsis, which they considered the essence of drama.  If ever there was a story tailor-made to evoke terror and catharsis, it is surely the Titanic.  They form the keys to the epic's enduring fascination.  By depicting the whole affair as basically a colossal inconvenience for a lot of self-centered people at sea, Fellowes misses the boat.",1364860800,5,2975,5.059548254620124

That gives you a overview of how quickly it moves, but unfortunately, not a lot happens during that time. Each of the four episodes goes over the same ground focusing on different characters' points of view. It's S-L-O-W and doesn't really develop any of the story lines very well. What makes it interesting, though, is to see how much class really did matter back then. America was still a land of promise where a person with initiative could achieve dreams of greatness. This really illustrated what it meant to be a ""second class citizen."" It also brought home the unnecessary loss of life due to prejudice and ineptitude.

I'd recommend it for those who are interested in the historical aspects of the story or the time period, but if you are looking for something that is enjoyable, this probably isn't it.",1351641600,2,920,4.679012345679013
5054421,1,B0074JOCMC,"I gave this production just one star. Unfortunately, it is the worst Titanic movie/series I have watched. The SOS Titanic from 1979 is absolutely superior both when it comes to characters and the story itself.

This production contains a long list of goofs and grave errors, both when it comes to the vessel itself and also the things going on onboard. The characters speaks in a way that was absolutely inappropriate in 1912 and not something you associate with first class passengers (in some scenes).

They also manage to feed the idea of bad workmanship and that company greed was the reason for the life boat capacity. That is absolutely wrong! The British Board of Trade promoted the idea that the vessels should be life boats by themselves, through heavy compartmentalization. The Olympic class liners were designed according to this concept and could float with two sections completely flooded or the first four compartments flooded. The regulations demanded a seating capacity of 900 in the life boats and the vessels were in fact equipped with a life boat capacity of 1178. That is 278 seats more than required.

A cheap bomb plot is also put in place, just to fit the modern terrorist inspired minds.

Then we have the depiction of the ship itself. For the first time ever has a Titanic movie completely evaded the grand staircase. Even the budget production from 1996 shows it. Then we have the very strange corridor placed where the gymnasium is - and an even more interesting stair case leading from it to the third class dining room.

They bragged about showing the second class in this series. The little problem is that they shows almost nothing of it, just something that pretends to be the main stair case in that class. SOS Titanic did a much better job since it focused on the second class passenger Lawrence Beesley.

The plot with the Italian restaurant staff that was locked in is simply too much. The same goes with the usual ""locked in third class passengers"". By just checking the GA plans of the vessel, that common myth can be put to rest. Those passengers had access to the forward and stern welldecks and the poopdeck. It was possible to go from there to the upper decks by using the stairs.

It is the only Titanic production I have viewed that was directly boring. The gross inaccuracies made it too uninteresting.

For those who want a pretty decent TV interpretation of the disaster, watch the full edition of the SOS Titanic. Even if it shows a ""dream version"" of the ship, it is much better made and a lot more correct.

Among the movies, the A Night to Remember is the best bet, followed by the Cameron movie of 1997. The absolute strength of that movie is that is shows the vessel in a very good way.

I can also recommend the Saving the Titanic. It is an interesting and well made depiction of the effort of the crew when they tried to keep her afloat after the collision.",1347926400,8,2912,4.636893203883496

5054434,4,B0074JOCMC,"To mark the centennial of the sinking of the Titanic comes a four-part miniseries that combines fictional characters with real-life figures that were on board the doomed vessel as it crossed the Atlantic, exploring the lives of each one prior to the voyage, and their actions once the ship hits the iceberg.

The unique thing about this particular retelling is its format: rather than tell the story in chronological order, each episode instead focuses on a particular family, taking us through the circumstances that bring them aboard Titanic and their initial activities on board, all the way up to the evacuation of the ship. It then ends on a cliff-hanger and starts all over again in the next episode, this time focusing on a new group of people. Each time, little sequences involving minor characters will be strewn throughout the main action, their meaning not becoming clear until the next episode sheds further light on their context.

To be honest, I'm not sure how successful this idea was. Although a second viewing makes many things much clearer, the first time around it's terribly confusing. There are far too many characters introduced in too short a space of time to keep track of them all, and several intercutting scenes seem random and pointless the first time you see them. It may have looked good on paper; this intricate weaving of characters and storylines as they head toward the inevitable, but in execution it doesn't quite gel. Perhaps it all would have worked better as a straightforward drama, with no choppy back-and-forthing in the order of events, but a slow boil up to the disaster after having gotten to know the characters first.

But of course, nothing concerning the Titanic could ever be dull: the glamorous setting, the impending disaster, the devastating conceit of a ship sinking beneath your feet without enough lifeboats for everyone on board. How can it ever be anything but riveting? So many different components make the story of the Titanic so compelling: that it was the most expensive and biggest ship of its age, that it was vaunted as ""unsinkable"", that it was on its maiden voyage, that it collided with the iceberg just on midnight, that it's one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history - any one of these things would have made the story unforgettable, but that it was such a perfect storm of iconic facts and figures means that were it was a work of fiction it would be derided as far too improbable.

Your heart starts pounding as soon as the iceberg makes its first appearance, and here the actual hitting of the iceberg is beautifully staged: the instrument of doom is a silent, alien presence that glides past the boat, does its damage, and disappears into the darkness. This adaptation understands that a disaster of this magnitude doesn't just *happen*, that there are a thousand little mistakes and chances and what-might-have-beens that caused the ship to sink, all conspiring against those on board. This mini-series is far more informative than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Cameron-film/dp/B007SPPANM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Cameron film</a>&nbsp;in exploring some of the reasons why the disaster was one of such magnitude: the lack of binoculars, the calm sea, the rumors that she was going too fast, the lack of lifeboats, the poorly managed evacuation, and other attributing factors.

It's easy enough to tell which characters are the creation of screenwriter Julian Fellowes and which are based on real people who were on board the Titanic at the time. Among the aristocracy are the Earl of Manton, travelling first class with his snobby wife Louisa and suffragette daughter Georgiana, who carries a guilty secret with him. With them are their servants, Barnes and Watson, the former holding something of a torch for the latter (though goodness knows why, as she's perpetually surly and sulky). Over the course of the episode, they rub shoulders with the likes of Benjamin Guggenheim, Lontine Aubert, the Countess of Rothes, Jack Thayer, Harry Elkins Widener, John Aster, Dorothy Gibson, Molly Brown, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, and other members of the upperclass who were real passengers at the time.

The second episode concentrates more on the second class, represented mainly by John Batley, a lawyer to Manton, and his wife Muriel, who is fed up with being looked down upon by her husband's employers. This episode also explores more of the mistakes that led to the sinking, from the conference room of the White Star, where Bruce Ismay and Thomas Andrews argue over safety regulations, and on board ship, where Captain Smith debates weather conditions and the ship's speed with figures such as First Officer Murdoch and Second Officer Lightoller. These aspects are quite informative, shedding light on some aspects of design and circumstance that I was not aware of (particularly the dismissal of David Blair before the voyage, leading to the absence of binoculars on board ship after he left with the key to the case).

The third episode deals with the third class, namely the Irish family: Jim and Mary Maloney and their children, seeking a new life in America. On board ship, Mary is somewhat unsettled by the presence of a stowaway that she recognizes as ""Peter the Painter"", an Irish terrorist/revolutionary (who may or may not have been a real person, having never been found by the authorities). Elsewhere, Italian brothers Mario and Paolo Sandrini get jobs on board ship, and Paolo is instantly smitten by the stewardess Annie Desmond.

The final episode is the only one to actually begin on-board ship and begin to weave together all the storylines. Here the cliffhangers are resolved, and we find out who lives and who dies (well, among the fictional characters at least). From a technical point of view, the production is well put together, though undoubtedly on a budget. However else you feel about James Cameron's blockbuster film, it was the definitive portrayal of the Titanic in terms of scale and authenticity, and here the sets look small and the special-effects rather obvious in comparison. The ensemble cast is very good, with a few particular standouts (Steven Campbell Moore, Jenna Louise Coleman, Toby Jones, Steven Waddington, and Diana Kent, who with the delivery of one line - ""my son cannot swim"" - will break your heart) and it's clear that we're watching a screenplay by Julian Fellowes when it comes to the little gems of dialogue: ""No one is more morally indignant than a beauty the wrong side of forty,"" and ""Next time we're in a disaster, make sure it's not with foreigners,"" and in a discussion concerning whether someone is Irish: ""if I grew up in a kennel, would it make me a dog?"" and the darkly ironic ""I hope one day [your mother] will be able to forgive us,"" to the shipmate dismissed from duty just before the Titanic leaves port.

Yet it feels like what Julian Fellowes really wanted to write was ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>&nbsp;on a Boat"", meaning that the first half of each episode is spent on his favourite subjects: the class divide, intrigues among the aristocracy and staff, no less than four blossoming love affairs, and so on; only for that pesky iceberg to put an abrupt halt to all the stories and start up something completely different. Stories that are started don't feel finished - and though you can naturally say that this was the precise point of the drama, in that a life's course can change in a heartbeat - it also feels oddly unsatisfying. The fates of many characters remain unclear, and the ambitions, heartbreaks and familial intrigues that were established before the disaster aren't given any closure. (Like, what happened with the nursemaid with the baby? What was the deal with the Irish wife and the terrorist? And what about Lord Manton's illegitimate daughter?) It almost feels like we're watching two different shows at the same time: a period drama and a disaster film.

There other things that don't work (a child would never run away from their mother in a crisis, I don't care how terrified they are, for people facing a watery grave, many of them manage to come up with remarkably eloquent final speeches, and despite the class divide being Julian Fellowes's forte, here it's simplified into aristocratic snobs versus resentful working class) but on the whole, for a mini-series that only exists thanks to the centennial of the actual sinking, it's informative, effective and memorable.

The special features include the usual extras, including a DVD commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes and profiles on the cast, but of more interest is the third disc, containing a documentary that involves the casting of actors as various real-life passengers, reciting the accounts they made as though being interviewed. This includes several British stars such as Richard E. Grant, Joseph Mawle, Roger Allam, Claudie Blackley, Nancy Carroll, Anna Madeley, Isabella Rita, and James Wilby. Narrated by Charles Dance, it's an innovative idea, and a nice companion to the mini-series.",1344556800,4,9227,5.1405729513657565
5054435,4,B0074JOCMC,"Alrighty, we all know the story of the Titanic, so I'll skip that and go right to the heart of the matter. This is a four part mini-series that offers a fairly unique take on the voyage. The first three episodes offers three different 'main focus' perspective (passengers, crew, stowaways) and each of those episodes jumps back to the start of trip and ends as the ship is being evacuated. The four episode deals with more of the immediate aftermath for those that survived in terms of looking for other survivors while waiting for rescue and mourning for those who did not make it.

The overall production is pretty ambitious for it's aims and there's enough there in terms of the sets to forget that this was a TV production. Compared to the James Cameron mess that hit theaters in 1996, the miniseries gives more to the actual feeling of the trip without the sappiness and bad acting.

I do recommend renting the series, but take my advice watch the episodes on four consecutive days as opposed to one sitting. It helps deals with the 'back to the start' style described above.",1344297600,2,1080,4.619791666666667

We see the stories of those in first-class and thier servants.  I particularly liked the snobbery that existed within the first class passengers (a sort of new money vs. old money / British vs. American snobbery).  We also see the passengers in 2nd class and of course steerage as well as those who worked on the ship.

The style of showing the same scene from different perspectives I found very interesting.  Some say it was confusing - but it really doesn't take much thinking to follow along the story lines.

The sets, costumes, and acting are all first rate.

5054438,3,B0074JOCMC,"The claimed catalyst for this four hour miniseries was the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking on April 14, 1912.  If the makers of this TV event truly wanted to commemorate the actual history of Titanic, a better idea might have been to begin with the news of the disaster as it reached the world followed by the American inquest wherein surviving crew and passengers were questioned in an effort to find out the truth of what happened - and these accounts could have led to the flashback structure that is in place in the miniseries.  The difference is this: Julian Fellowes' Forsythe Saga-esque script has less to do with the actual historicity of Titanic and more to do with a grand soap opera dealing with class structure in the early part of the 20th century. The invented characters who interact with some historical personages are, by and large, cardboard cutouts.  Much of what the invented passengers and crew do and say is rather unbelievable and largely cliched.  The miniseries is also laden with historical inaccuracies, despite the producer's and writer's and various other crew members' claims to have striven for absolute accuracy as much as humanly possible.  To realize that the entire production has more to do with its fictions than its facts, one need only watch the second DVD's six making-of featurettes.  On those self-aggrandizing  featurettes very little is said about the historical Titanic and its sinking - and much more is said about what a great miniseries those involved are creating.  As several other Amazonians have said, the true stories of the actual Titanic passengers and crew are far more fascinating and interesting than the made-up characters in this miniseries.

Yet despite my hesitations and reservations, this script is actually mostly much better than James Cameron's script for his bloated disaster of a disaster movie.  His fictional folks were truly juvenile and insipid.  When Dawson teaches Rose how to spit like a man just so she can spit into the face of her cardboard villain husband many reels later is just one sad instance of clumsy, overt manipulation of basically shoddy material to begin with.  So the romances and intrigues in this miniseries are, actually, much better conceived and written then the Jack/Rose romance of Cameron's sloppy film.  Having said that, the characters in Julian Fellowes' tale of Titanic are still mainly made of the stuff of soap operas.  Why invent - when true stories still cry out from the ghostly depths of the Sea and Time waiting to be told before they are truly forgotten?  More people know of the phony, fictitious and anachronistic Jack Dawson than they do about Jacques Futrelle.  And that is a true pity.

Still-and-all, this take on the great tragedy is still entertaining and worthwhile.  Most anything that has to do with Titanic usually is entertaining in one way or another. Even the '60s TV series TIME TUNNEL's take on Titanic was entertaining. As for the film under dicussion, however, there are other troubles: the interiors of the ship are extremely sub-standard. I'd like to think that the grand staircase was purposefully left out so as not to make viewers long to see Jack Dawnson standing beneath the clock waiting for Rose. But more likely, it was a budgetary concern. The music score is mostly extremely uninspired and therefore annoying.  There is way too much of it and all it does is attempt to push the viewers' buttons and dictate way too obviously what it is we should be feeling since the deep feelings we should be experiencing somehow aren't always there.  Once a viewer gleans just how manipulative the storyline actually is, the ability to empathize and sympathize becomes quite tasked.

The overlapping flashback structure of the story is quite interesting and well-reasoned.  It reminded me of CITIZEN KANE's complex structure in many ways.  And in the last episode - which does rally to land a handful of emotional wallops - is an absolutely brilliantly conceived and executed scene of the sinking ship shown as background to the frantic foreground search atop a lifeboat and in the icy waters of one brother trying to find the other.  This one brief scene alone is worth the price of admission. It speaks volumes about individual human loss in relationship and juxtaposition to the larger, background canvas of the great liner's imminent death as it lists and lights blink on and off as it dies and readies to sink. As the ship dies, so dies the one brother's desperate hopes of finding his own brother alive. I daresay that this one sequence gave me a stronger sense of being there than anything in the Cameron depiction of the actual sinking.  It is that brilliant!  Was it scripted and storyboarded as such - or did the CGI folks conceptualize it?  I do not know.  All I know is that it is stunningly realized and executed - as are the truly haunting recreations of the ship slowly sinking below the icy Atlantic as the lifeboat survivors watch in numbed shock and horror.  At this point, the music likewise rallies and matches the scene perfectly.

Despite its own faults, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is still the best dramatic recreation of the Titanic tragedy.  The Clifton Webb/Barbara Stanwyck TITANIC is memorable for the truly touching fictional tale that is its main essence.  Cameron's TITANIC goes overboard with way too many special effects - and its fictional story goes overboard...and sinks.  This miniseries, despite its many faults, is still entertaining and worth seeing - if only for that one incredible shot.

5054439,5,B0074JOCMC,"Jenna Louise Coleman as Annie Desmond is great in her role.
It is the first movie or television show I have seen her in.  I'm guessing she is more popular in Britain.  This
is probably a break out role for most to get to know her in the USA, if they haven't already.  I know she
has been in some television shows that you can watch here, but it is the first that I've heard of her.
I would get the dvd just for her character.  She is a realist in the movie and
her character, along with her personality, is strong.  Not so much to be a turn
off however.  She shows emotion as well.
You sympathize with her.  Not to put down anyone else.  All the characters in the
movie were excellent and well acted.  I also like the character portrayed by Sophie Winkleman who
is Dorothy Gibson in the movie.  I won't get into all the characters in the movie, but they were
all great.  I can't name a flaw in anything.  They all had different and specific personalties for this
well made series for television.
Don't expect this to be as grand as the Titanic movie made in 1997 or the older versions made
for the movie theater.  It wasn't meant to be.  It is more of a drama on board the ship.  Although
it could have been made longer for it to be better, you will see enough of the movie to feel for
the characters involved.  Mostly fictional intermingled with the real persons that were on the ship
at the time.  You get a sense that it could have happened in that way.
This is a made for television series on a budget.  So don't expect to see every detail.  It is as accurate
as can be for a television series.
The dvd will explain a lot and will show what was missed
in the cut up for commercials during the broadcast in America, which
is unfortunate.
Some might get turned off by some of the politics in the movie but
there are emotional parts as well.  Overall, a very good movie.  Well worth the buy
to see what was missing in the television version and to get the extras on the dvd as well.
Make sure to watch it up to the end credits to get a little explanation at the end
of the movie about what happened afterward in real life and the changes that were
made to liners after this tragedy.",1339286400,,2183,4.15
5054440,4,B0074JOCMC,"This mini-series has the familiar ingredients that we all expect for a Titanic production to be a success. Unfortunately, in this case the mixture only adds up to a partial success.

The producer's checklist seems to have included:

Grand settings. The ones here adequately invoke a Victorian house interior and/or a cruise ship, but are not especially impressive. This is clearly lower budget than some Titanic productions.

A good ragtime band and a romantic dance scene. Delivered, though the band doesn't play for long. A cynical quip by a band member about playing while the ship goes down. Delivered.

An instant romance, so the lovers can be parted when the ship sinks.  This film delivers several. One is between Georgiana, the suffragette daughter of the Earl of Manton, and the (non-fictional character) Harry Widener, a wealthy book collector from Philadelphia. One is  between the flirtatious Italian waiter Paolo and the equally flirtatious Annie, a maid for the second class. A third is a stately courtship between the Earl of Manton's valet and the Duchess's maid.  Unfortunately, there are so many story lines, and so much flitting between them, that they all lack conviction.

A troubled married couple whose underlying love is brought out by the tragedy. Here we have two, the Earl and Duchess of Manton, and Manton's Irish lawyer and his wife.

A closely united married couple who lose each other and/or children in the tragedy. Here they're in third class.

A bold woman who plays cards and drinks with the men.  It's usually the Unsinkable Molly Brown, but here Guggenheim's mistress Madame Aubar is a weak stand-in.

A man fleeing the law. Here it's the anarchist Peter the Painter, who may or may not have been a real person. Note:  It proves handy to have a terrorist on board.

A collision with an iceberg. Here it's remarkably played down. The iceberg is never visible, and the way the ship is doomed by the crew trying to set a speed record is barely mentioned.

The parents of several children who frantically search for one missing child as their lifeboat is being boarded, forcing them to make a hard decision. Delivered.

The third-class passengers being locked down as the ship sinks.  Delivered.

The first-class male passenger(s) who display the stiff upper lip by calmly sitting in a drawing room and drinking brandy as the ship goes down. Delivered.

Captain Smith insisting on going down with the ship. Delivered.

Great sinking special effects.  Only adequate here.

Wandering lifeboats in the darkness, with arguments about whether to return for the people floating in the water. Delivered.

One nearby ship not responding because they thought the flares were for a party and because they turned their wireless off.  Not delivered. Carpathia speeding to the rescue. Delivered only from the passengers' viewpoint, which is however fairly effective.

Class distinctions. This production differs from others in constantly emphasizing them. The Duchess of Manton sneers at everyone, including the selection of companions in her lifeboat. Manton's lawyer's wife spews Irish separatist sentiments. The British servants refuse to eat at the same table as the American servants. The third-class passengers are all looking for a better life in America. While this is to some extent realistic, it becomes tiresome and made me care much less about the characters.

Overall, it's an OK production. It's just that we've become accustomed to great productions.",1338163200,,3485,5.123893805309734

It is not your James Cameron's Titanic so if that is what  you are looking for this is not  your product.  Unlike some of the other reviewers I found myself caring about the characters.

5054452,4,B0074JOCMC,"Perhaps the crew that made this mini-series was intimidated by all of the movies and mini-series that have gone before or perhaps a network exectuive somewhere decided that Julian Fellowes was the writer of the moment and the Titanic 100 year anniversary was fast approaching and putting these two elements together could only result in a win for the station and the audience. In theory I agree with him, in practice, this mini-series, which could have been great was lackluster due to flatly written characters and hackneyed situations.

The narrative structure is interesting with each episode covering the same time period for different characters ranging from steerage to first class. The class conflicts that make the Titanic a legend are presented so superfically that they could have been written by a Marxist cartoonist writing propaganda for the retarded. The characters are all stereotypes that never get beyond a quick outline. Real life characters, such as Officer Lightoller, a genuine hero his entire life, are presented in a poor light in an attempt to give the characterizations ""depth"". The acting is solid, the production values pretty but it is all in all a disappointment, made more keen by the fact that a great drama about the Titanic that was an antidote to the romance and adventure of 1997's Titanic would have been welcomed by many viewers.

5054453,2,B0074JOCMC,"So I was curious about this.  Never watched Downton Abbey (maybe I'm the only one?) but I knew it had a good rep so I went into this expecting it to be pretty decent.  I get the feeling it was going for historical accuracy, a snapshot of Edwardian society that just happened to be compressed into a doomed ship.  In the end I think it said more about the writers than the people on the Titanic.

What I liked:

I actually thought the approach was bold. I didn't warm to the characters because if it but I admire the non-misty eyed approach. Not everyone was the Titanic was likeable, after all, and not just the obvious villains would have grated against our modern sensibilities.  There was a lot of snobbery, class lines were rarely crossed and fear of the masses drove the whole thing along, sending many to their doom for reasons that seem horrifying to us.  I also thought it production looked pretty good considering its TV budget.  A few of the characters were likeable and Toby Jones is always watchable.

What I didn't like:

Maybe it went too hard for the realism or maybe it was OTT, slipping into caricature, but it was very hard to care about the fates of many of the people depicted and, well, the thing about the Titanic is it was a loss.  When you have a cluster of nasty people you mostly want to slap it's hard to see their loss as a tragedy.  Having the story hang off such characters was a bold move but I am not sure it paid off.

The non-linear story telling didn't bother me. The fact it ended where it did didn't bother me, I just found it utterly lacking in any emotional impact aside from a desire to smack most of the people in First Class (and a number of crew).

I didn't like the demonisation of Captain Smith either.  It was an inaccurate portrayal based on all accounts I've read on the man and was utterly unnecessary.  I am not a fan of being controversial for the sake of being controversial. I know it's not that well respected but I was far more moved by the James Cameron effort, imperfect though it was.

The red card for me, though, came as the great ship went down.  People were falling, jumping, into the ice water.  Jumping to their deaths and I was... appalled to hear a very distinctive sound.  The Wilhelm Scream is a well known sound editors in-joke.  It tends to appear in action films (George Lucas likes to slip it into his) and tends to accompany some on-screen calamity suffered by some back-ground, fictional, henchman.  It's a little game, played for laughs for those in the know.

It is HIGHLY disrespectful to assign it to the death cries of an actual person being depicted in a historical drama such as this. I don't know whose idea but they should be reminded what was being depicted.  It was crass and lowered the tone of the whole production for me.  Disbelief was all I had left then.

Over all this just made me want to watch the James Cameron version.",1337731200,6,2914,4.4
5054454,3,B0074JOCMC,"I bought this product mainly to finish my collection of Titanic movies.
As for what this recent mini series is like. I rank it as one of the most worse Titanic related TV items.
It is true that Julian Fellowes did have to meet a extremely high bench mark set by James Camerons 1997 Movie ""Titanic"" to be accepted as good but he didn't even reach good. There were too many fictious charaters set in when there was plenty of stories from real passengers they could have used. It showed a scene of steerage class passengers on A deck just under the bridge. The engine telegraphs where the wrong way round Full Ahead would have the handles facing forward not backwards, they were also too small. The wheelhouse was missing from the bridge area, and it showed Bruce Ismay trying to convice Captain Smith to slow down when it was actually the other way round. Some areas of the ship displayed incorrectly such as the smoking room, and a stairway to second class from the officers quarters. There was never any stairway to second class from the officers quarters the entrance was down the far end of the boat deck. Both areas could have been display correctly if Julian had looked at any Titanic books. Or purchased Ship Simulator 2008 which has a highly detailed Titanic in it.

5054457,5,B0074JOCMC,"I found this film to be a very different kind of Titanic movie. While I will not say that I liked this film as much as James Cameron's ""Titanic,"" I do have to say that I liked it tremendously and found it to be a totally different experience altogether.

This film is all about the people! If I had to break this down I'd say this film is 80% about the people and characters that made up the gilded age and 20% about the historical facts and events that were the Titanic tragedy itself. That said, it in no way deterred me from enjoying the film. I found it fascinating engaging, interesting, and all around fantastic!

This Titanic film is very much a ensemble film. I mean seriously the cast is enormous.  One downside of the film is that during the initial hour of the film it can be a bit difficult to keep track of who is who and who works for who and so on.  That said the film focuses on all three classes.

The Earl of Manton is traveling with his wife and daughter in 1st Class. In the first hour of the film we get to see their experience on the ship and their various interactions with both historical and fictional characters aboard the Titanic. Here in this hour of the film this rendition of the Titanic shines. We are able to get more of the stories of Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress Madame Aubar, Jack Thayer, John Jacob Astor, Dorothy Gibson, and Harry Elkins Widener.  The character of Lady Manton is initially unlikeable as she exudes the snobbery that was that particular time period. This is especially clear in her constantly bringing class in to just about every scene that she is in. Lady Manton's husband however is portrayed in a much more self aware and heroic light.

The film also delves into a fairly ignored group on the Titanic and that is the first class servants and their various interactions with their employers and each other. I found the story between the Manton's servants to be quite moving and yet beautifully subtle.  On that same token the film also focuses on another group of people often ignored by Titanic films, White Star Line employees who were not seamen. The film does this through the experiences of first class server Paolo Sandrini, Italian stoker Mario Sandrini, and 2nd class Stewardess Annie Desmond. Through their stories, the audience is given a glimpse as to what it would have been like to work on the Titanic. Paolo is a romantic dreamer and Annie is very much a practical pleasant person who doesn't believe in envy. These two have a beautiful love story that is probably the strongest in the series.

John Batley and his wife Muriel give us the second class point of view, another group often ignored in most Titanic films. Batley is a employee of the Earl of Manton and very much a unassertive person and his wife Muriel more than makes up for this. She comes off as a very angry woman whose terribly unhappy with her position in life and detests the modern class structure.

In Steerage, the film portrays the Maloney family who are moving from Ireland to New York to escape the religious persecution they were exposed to as Catholics in Ireland (at least that's what I gathered). Jim is in charge of the Titanic's electrical wiring and is given free passage for his wife Mary and their children (I think they had 4 maybe 5). To be very honest I found their story to be the weakest and most convoluted by ""soapiness."" Their story straightforward was powerful enough, but it gets muddied by Mary's wandering eye to another third class passenger, Peter. Peter is not just any normal passenger, he is lifted right out of history. Peter is ""Peter The Painter."" A historical figure lifted right out of the headlines of the time (definitely a bit of a unnecessary stretch).

So the movie itself I found to be quite effective and beautiful. Is it historically accurate? Definitely not 100%, but what Titanic movie is? Did Harry Elkins Widener actually have a romance with a woman aboard the Titanic? Who knows for certain, but it's definitely not historically documented. That said, Widener's romance with Georgiana was entertaining and emotionally engaging and also gave the writer the opportunity to display some facets of what is known about Widener's personality. After seeing the film, I researched him and actually found him to be a very interesting character in history during both his life and after his death.

Were Steerage passengers barricaded down below?  Quite frankly, no one knows for certain one way or the other and depending on what you read or see you get a different point of view.  The fact is we do not know what every single person was doing on that ship 24/7, so taking some degree of artistic liberty when making a MOVIE and I stress the word again...A MOVIE...is not the worst thing ever. Pretty much every Titanic  film, even the much beloved film, ""A Night To Remember,"" had too.

The sinking of the ship is portrayed beautifully. We get to see the sinking in a manner that I have yet to see prior and that's the view of the ship's final moments from the perspective of someone in the water.  It's effective and looked quite realistic.

The Blu-Ray and DVD  both have beautiful picture quiality and the special features are interesting. The documentary focuses mostly on the Titanic's sister ship Britannic, its sinking, and dives to the wreck.

So I will say this, if you're a Titanic fan and you can enjoy the movie for the characters and not let every little historical inaccuracy drive you nuts (and I'm not saying that there are a ton because there's not) then get this movie and sit down and enjoy it! Fans of the Cameron film will simply find many more enjoyable perspectives to a story that they already know.",1336176000,5,5713,4.626482213438735

The brave decision might have been to put together a Titanic drama that did not show the ship or its sinking at all. A four parter picking up on the story from the arrival of the Carpathia and the subsequent arrival of the survivors in New York would be fascinating, for example.

Nevertheless an absorbing and enjoyable four hours with many fine performances.

Nice recreation of the interiors too, especially the first class dining room: a Jacobean hall as envisaged by Stanley Kubrick in dazzling white with the merest hint of Viennese Secession creeping into some of the details (like the glazing bars) to remind us that the 1920s are on the way.",1335657600,,951,4.968553459119497
5054461,2,B0074JOCMC,"Whether you tend to like Julian Fellowes' ""Titanic"" for the centenary of the ship's tragic demise really depends on your approach to the material: if you want a quality fact-based drama, this film is not for you; if you want a soap opera based on class divisions, conjecture, and fictionalized characterizations, this might possibly satisfy. The production is long and highly fragmented, is told with much non-linearity and from multiple viewpoints, is somewhat repetitive, and is frequently just plain boring.

The actual sinking of the ""Titanic"" is certainly a dramatic enough story without introducing scads of characters it was impossible to identify with, and even harder to care about. As but one example, I found the improbable and impetuous relationship between Italian waiter Paulo (Glen Blackhall) and a British maid to be exquisitely painful and cloying, and probably the single most annoying ""highlight"" of the movie (though other onboard relationships fared little better.) The film had decent sets and middling effects (they certainly don't hold a candle to James Cameron's megabudget blockbuster) and the DVD comes with a few token extras, mostly related to the making of the movie.

I have been interested in the ""Titanic"" since reading Walter Lord's masterpiece ""A Night to Remember"" as a boy (the film of the same name is still the best of the ""Titanic"" lot) and was genuinely looking forward to this miniseries. Sadly, it is one of the lesser ""Titanic"" cinematic outings, although for people who tend to romanticize the accident it is full of intrigue, lurid details, and characters that are largely imaginary. Despite some strong performances (and some naturally much more appropriate to a soap opera) this presentation is highly fragmented for viewing (due to point of view and commercial break issues) and is far less compelling or interesting than it should and could have been. I never thought a film about the most dramatic shipwreck in modern history could be so boring.

The story we all know so well should have been told much better, and lensing the movie in highly fragmented ""Soap Opera-vision"" was a very poor choice. Julian Fellowes' script is not genuinely instructional about the accident and contributes little towards understanding or appreciating the wreck and its significance to early twentieth century American and English culture as the world entered the machine age.

5054494,5,B0074JOCMC,"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the best-documented disasters in history, and the 2200 or so souls on board the ship when it hit the iceberg provide an extraordinarily rich treasure trove for any story teller. Julian Fellowes' four-part telling of the story is much truer to the variety of stories involved than James Cameron's. Indeed, I think the Fellowes version is an extraordinary achievement.

And my wife and I found the Fellowes' version truly moving, at many points. The only moment in Cameron's movie that I found even the slightest bit affecting was when the elderly Rose (played wonderfully by Gloria Stuart) drops the Heart of the Ocean off the back of the research ship. But that of course has NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE TRUTH. It's a nice little moment of made-up drama, but for Pete's sake, the Titanic disaster doesn't need any help in the drama department! Cameron has so little dramatic imagination that he has to USE the Titanic story as a framework on to which to graft what he thinks will really grab people, the idiotic romance between the drifter Jack and the upper-class brat Rose. Fellowes' Titanic also makes stuff up, but its fictions are more closely tied to the disaster and at no point overwhelm it. He touches on several very credible love stories: young Widener (a historical character) and the rich beauty played by Perdita Weeks; Toby Jones's lawyer and his wife; the Italian waiter and the second-class stewardess or maid; and touches on several others. But these situations don't compete with the historical fact of the sinking. Rather they illuminate it by giving you some sense of the incredible heartbreak involved in falling or being in love when death is staring you in the face. Reminds me of the phone good-byes from 9/11 victims. Every story adds a piece to the big picture, and viewed together, they allow you to get a sense of the magnitude of the suffering experienced by those directly involved.

Fellowes' Titanic screenplay is, I think, nothing short of brilliant, one of the most intellectually appealing screenplays I can think of, ever. In each of the four episodes, he tells the general story of the sinking of the Titanic from a different perspective. The first episode views the disaster largely from the first-class; the second, largely from the second class; and the third from the third class. These different narratives intersect at a number of points in interesting ways, for example, in one episode you see a quarrel between a second-class husband and wife from their perspective, with the maid in the background; in the following episode you see a bit of the same quarrel but this time from the maid's perspective. The effect is contrapuntal, indeed, fugal. (I think Browning's great poem The Ring and the Book may do something similar but I read it decades ago.) In the fourth episode, all of the classes and all of the stories get dumped into the ocean, that is, the stories all come together sub specie aeternitatis, or if that is too grand, sub specie humanitatis -- from the perspective not of a single social class but of Humanity in general.

True, there is no chase scene in the Fellowes' version, no gunfight, no thrilling helicopter photography showing a mediocre actor on the bow yelling ""I'm the king of the world"". In Fellowes' story a lower-class waiter with a lot of nerve may dare to wink at a pretty girl in first class but he's going to get scolded for it immediately, and he certainly isn't going to fall in love with her or her with him. If you prefer your history to be massively fictionalized to suit modern-day sensibilities, then by all means, skip this version and stick to Cameron's. You will have plenty of company.

But Fellowes' version tells the story of the Titanic -- and sketches the many stories of its passengers -- more honestly, and more dramatically. I think this is about as good as television gets.

*

One or two loose ends...

I didn't see the shows when they were broadcast. I rented the Blu-Ray the instant it became available (just a few days ago) and watched all four episodes in two nights. I think watching the episodes together like this is probably desirable. Next time I think I'll watch the whole thing in one sitting. It certainly makes it much easier to see the points where the episodes intersect when your memory of previous episodes is fresh.

When I popped the first disk in the player, I was pretty sure the special effects would be mediocre at best. I was wrong. They are top notch. I have to say that I think they are SUPERIOR to Cameron's version. Let me explain what i mean. Cameron's Titanic reminds me of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, in that both took quite interesting stories, vulgarized them, and produced movies that remain watchable only for the special effects. The CGI work in Fellowes' Titanic is brilliantly done and as convincing as it needs to be without competing with the drama. Another analogy: The film Gettysburg does a better job of depicting the drama of battle as experienced by the soldiers than Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, even though the former uses no expensive effects to show people's heads blown off ""realistically"". THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE BREAK BETWEEN DRAMA AND REALITY and when drama tries too hard to LOOK real, it simply leaves you admiring the artifice. (Ars celare artem, as they used to say.)

The Fellowes' version has no memorable music or theme, unlike Gosford Park or Downton Abbey. I noticed this only after I had finished episode four. It is not a lack, I think. I certainly didn't miss it.",1335398400,7,5572,4.76580310880829

5054496,2,B0074JOCMC,"Before I comment on the program, will break down some facts:
- The actual program length is 184 minutes.  As Titanic was aired on ABC in a 4-hour frame (3 hours on 4/14 and 1 hour on 4/15/12), this averages to about 46 minutes of program time per each hour of air time.
- The above translates to 14 minutes of commercials and promos every hour.
- Nowadays, A typical 1-hour air-time program will have anywhere from 41 to 46 minutes of actual program.  As annoying as the commercials were, Titanic was on the high end of the program-to-commercial ratio.
- Extra trivia on actual program times in the past:
---  In the 1960s and before, a 1-hour slot had 51 minutes of actual program (check out DVDs or VHS tapes of shows like Star Trek or Hogan's Heroes [latter was a half-hour show; each episode has 25 minutes of run time]).
---  In the mid 1970s, a 1-hours slot had 48 minutes of program time.
- Nowadays, it's a very rare event when I watch a non-sports program while it's being aired, whether a major-network primetime show, a quasi-syndicated show on a cable network (an example is Covert Affairs on USA - Avg pgm time of 42 minutes in a one-hour slot), or a currently-airing game show (Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune).  I normally record these shows on a DVR and watch them later.  Besides the advantage of being able to skip commercials, I can also pause when the need arises without having to miss a scene.
  Now to the so-called mini-series.  The show was not easy to follow, given the fast rewinds that occurred when the next episode began.  The show also highlighted too many characters.  It was more like several mini-sagas that had one common setting, namely the Titanic.
  While I am a Titanic buff, I would not recommend this movie/mini-series.  In my opinion, the best movie done on the sinking of the Titanic is ""A Night to Remember.""  While knowledge on what occurred during the sinking was considerably less in the 1950s versus the 1990s or even today, the primary focus of ""A Night to Remember"" was the sinking and the events leading up to the collision, not some side romance or family breakup.",1335225600,4,2115,4.558201058201059
5054497,5,B0074JOCMC,Wow...people are really negative on here.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with this story.  I think the problem was all of the commercials.  There were so many of them that you couldn't really follow the plot so I went back and watched it without commercials later and it was fantastic!  I loved the characters and their stories so watch it for yourself and then decide whether it's horrible or not.  Don't listen to those bad reviews!,1335225600,3,437,4.773333333333333
5054498,1,B0074JOCMC,"I also tried to watch this 4 part movie on tv. I wanted to like it but was unable to do so. There there many many commmercials which made it unbearably long. I also did not like how they kept going backward and forward in time. Like they would start getting into some of the characters stories, then go to the actual tragedy then go to back to character stories again on the ship before the ship hits the iceberg again. The story kept doing this over and over.  While I generally don't mind some flashbacks this was ridicuously overdone and boring.
 I was unable to watch part 4 because the first 3 parts were just very very boring. I remember I was actually falling asleep at times because there was nothing really happening. The story needed to be rewritten and told in a more linear fashion. I would not recommend it.",1335225600,6,820,4.3881578947368425
5054499,4,B0074JOCMC,"We watched this on our dvr...thank goodness! The movie was very good, and it was interesting having the story told by different classes of patrons/employees. I would advise anyone who is intrigued by the Titanic's sinking, however, to rent or borrow the dvd; that way, you won't have to be annoyed by so many commercials. The bottom line: ABC should be ashamed of itself for destroying what could have been a very pleasant viewing experience, with the interruptions.",1335139200,4,466,4.987179487179487
5054500,2,B0074JOCMC,"I simply couldn't get into this mini-series. To keep things brief - there are far too many plot threads to gain much affection or interest towards any particular one. These threads crowd together so much that scenes that are supposed to be emotional and impacting lack any of that, rather feeling mashed together and hurried instead. The digital video filming of it augments this effect, too, glossing everything over with a fine sheen of production  that easily detaches the viewer from the very human events that are unfolding during the tragedy. Quite possibly the least impacting part of this show was the last hour, which chronicles the time of the collision and subsequent sinking. To make up for the fluff of the past three hours, the most dramatic part of the series feels very hurried, very ""let's get this over with"". Already suffering from the mass of characters in the prior three hours, this sole hour tries it's best to tie up these threads, and jumps around so much that in the span of about 15 or 20 minutes, we go from the collision with the iceberg to the lifeboats being nearly completely gone and the ship most of it's way to being sunk. And when the dramatic ""lights out"" moment finally comes, when the ship breaks in two, we hardly even see it! It's so far over in the frame it's almost out of it, and it's a completely anticlimactic moment. The actual disaster provides so much room for creating powerful drama with it's very real events, and it's not utilized at all in this production. The final straw for me was when a freezing passenger is pulled out of the water, near death, and is revived back to consciousness with a shot of brandy. Alcohol LOWERS the body temperature - it wouldn't help at all, and would probably put him in even worse shape!

What I do give the series credit it for, is at least attempting to focus more on the relationships and people on the ship than the sole couple James Cameron's film focused on (though I absolutely adore the Cameron film). I can almost understand keeping the final hour of the show so anti-climactic in that respect - it does force you to focus more on the characters than the action. But it could have, and should have, been done so much better. I get the feeling this show was rushed through production to slip in on time for the centennial of the disaster, and it really suffers for it.",1335052800,7,2363,4.557647058823529
5054501,1,B0074JOCMC,"I don't know about other people, but when I am lied to, I feel angry and cheated. We were promised that this version would ""set the record straight""; furthermore, Julian Fellowes then appeared on many a talk show junket decrying the inaccuracy of the James Camerons' version ... and then he comes up with this drivel, the errors of which are described on many a website, such as Paul Lee's collection of gaffes. Fellowes is described as a Titanic nut (he provided the foreword for the new edition of ""A Night To Remember"") and wrote the scripts over an 18 month period, so how can he have made so many glaring errors? Did he do any research at all? I am not blaming him for the film restarting from scratch on every episode, as this was the decision of the producer, but for the writer to populate the ship with caricatures of real people, or by people with whom this reviewer felt no empathy (Paolo and Annie possibly excepted) I felt this Titanic was doomed like its namesake.",1335052800,13,978,4.5
5054522,1,B0074JOCMC,"To say this was dreadful is a huge understatement.  The fictional characters were not engaging or sympathetic, and I was rooting for most of them to drown.  The real people on the Titanic were far more interesting, yet Julian Fellows' screenplay insisted on going off on a totally uninteresting tangent.

The flashbacks became tedious in the first episode, and served only to fill in time.  In fact, this would have been a 90 minute movie without all the annoying and repetitive flashbacks -- and commercials every five minutes.

I watched the whole thing, partly because I couldn't believe it would not have some redeeming scene if only I waited, and partly because I wanted to see the ship sink.  I was wrong on both points -- no redeeming scene, and the screen was so dark that the sinking was hardly visible.  And talk about an abrupt ending -- yuck!

I'm going to watch the Nazi Titanic again -- at least its blatant propaganda is obvious.  This one?  Why did they even bother?  If I could give it zero stars, I would.",1334793600,8,1023,4.596685082872928
5054523,4,B0074JOCMC,"The series just finished airing on TV this past weekend.  A Downton Abbey fan, I was excited about this new series written by the same creator Julian Fellowes. The first episode, however, was confusing and disappointing.  I didn't plan to watch any more until I read a review from a journalist who had been permitted to watch the first two episodes.  The review acknowledged that episode 1 was poor but promised that it got much better by episode 2 -- and it did.  I thoroughly enjoyed the final 3 episodes and the finale, especially, definitely evoked an emotional response from me.

The format of the show might have made episode 1 seem too fast and too confusing, with little character development.  Essentially, each episode tells the same story from different angles, with the disaster (the iceberg) occurring about 30 minutes into each episode.  Characters and plot lines that might only have been explored only briefly in one episode would often be revealed in further detail in a future episode, so that by the end each character has been richly developed and revealed.

The show looks at characters from various classes and backgrounds -- from first class British aristocrats to lower class British maids and Italian immigrants. The stories of the captain (Smith), ship designer (Andrews), and ship owner (Ismay) are some of the most compelling, looking at leadership decisions that might have contributed to the disaster and how the leaders/managers responded to the disaster differently.  By the end, I enjoyed it thoroughly and appreciated the complexity of multiple storylines (I re-watched Cameron's Titanic movie with Winslet & DiCaprio, and Cameron's storyline seemed so simplistic in the comparison).",1334793600,3,1717,5.169675090252707
5054524,2,B0074JOCMC,"I finally slogged through all 4 hours (3 without commercials) of Julian Fellowes ""Titanic"" mini series. It's probably one of the worst Titanic films I've ever seen. The episodic nature of the four separate hour-long chapters (which is how it was shown in England) included multiple replays of several scenes without adding to the story, and fatally detracting from the flow of the action. The Titanic story is driven by suspense as much as tragedy. It works because the viewer (or reader) gets caught up in the sudden shift from complacency aboard ship, to the shock of realizing that your ""unskinkable"" ship is going down, there aren't enough boats, and you're probably going to die. The buildup to that climax is essential to the story. Instead, you have the story start and stop four times in this production, killing any sense of suspense.

The Titanic story is full of amazing people and incidents, without having to invent fanciful ones, which this series does to a far greater degree than other Titanic fictionalizations. It even mixes fictional characters with real ones, creating fake ""relationships.""  An hour or so into this and my eyes were already glazing over from all the soap.

The efforts to use the ship as a microcosm for the British class system are clumsy and heavy handed. Most of the first class passangers are a petty, shallow, dislikable lot who hardly scare up much sympathy from viewers when their fate is known. Viewers are more likely to think ""who cares?"" if so-and-so drowns? Fellowes explores this area far more effectively in ""Downton Abbey"" than he does here. Most of the characters are cardboard cutouts, despite having 3 hours to flesh them out.

ABC-TV could not have done a more horrid job in its telecast of this series. Why the network chose to air 3 hours one night and only 1 hour the second night is really puzzling. By some odd front-office reasoning, the film was not shown in widescreen/letterbox format on the ABC stations, but was letterboxed on its HD channel! What sense does that make (or am I asking a dumb question here)? Commercial breaks were countless and occurred at an average rate of every 7 minutes!!! How can you maintain any sort of story momentum with constant disruptions like that? Moreover, the commericial breaks cut in suddenly and abrasively, with not so much as a short fadeout of the film as they went into commercial break. One second some poor sod is drowning, the next you've got a supermodel smiling and salsa dancing; quite a jolt.

I'd forgotten just how annoying, artless and bottom-line network TV had gotten since defaulting to my DVR for most viewing. This was a stark reminder.",1334793600,4,2659,4.835164835164835
5054525,5,B0074JOCMC,"We've all seen different tales of Titanic depicted in various films, but this mini-series really gives you a unique look at what life might have been like on Titanic for passengers of every class, as well as the servants. The drama and edge- of -your -seat excitement does not only take place during the sinking, but through occasional scenes in the film.
Instead of one story, you get a few more that come with their own secrets. There might be a scene that you see twice, but it's always from a different point of view, and questions that you had earlier will be answered, and more details will be released.

I could watch this over and over again, and pick up a new detail every time. I haven't seen an episode of Downton Abbey yet, but after this I think I will have to.

If the producers of this  abomination did the same , the film would never have been made. For me, the series sunk  in the first episode.",1334707200,9,700,4.609756097560975
5054528,4,B0074JOCMC,"I am a historian, but I have also fairly accepted all Titanic movies and TV shows. So I will tell you about the Pros and Cons about this series and you can decide if you like it or not.

First off, let me say that I liked it. This series presented a new dynamic to seeing the Titanic and it also presented new real people who were on the ship (the Wideners, the Duff Gordons, and Dorothy Gibson are some examples). However, the first thing I will talk about is how the series is set up. The first three episodes have generally so many different points of view that are happening on the show. This is an awesome new way to look at a TV show, but you may not like this new style and thus the whole way the series is filmed will not be good for you. So in the end I liked this new dynamic, but depending who you are you may not like the way it is filmed with various point of views.

Now what are the plots? The good news is that this series did not generally rip off the popular James Cameron Titanic movie. This series does not really have a person from one class falling in love with another. Instead, there is a story in each class. The first episode will be off course first class where the wealthy elite of society are. The main character is the Earl of Manton is travelling with his wife Lady Manton and daughter Georgiana. Before the the voyage, Georgiana had ended up in jail and her father had to get her out. So Manton hopes to keep his daughter away from England while he goes to business in New York City. He also hopes she finds a husband. They also end up in conflict with some people who work for them in second class.

The second class story stars John Bately and his wife Muriel. John finds out his employer, the Earl of Manton, will be on board travelling first class. Bately is an attorney hired by Manton to hide a bad incident in his past. Muriel does not like her husband's business with people like the Earl of Manton.

Another story stars a perspective from the crew. Paolo, an Italian immigrant is travelling as a waiter in the first class dining room. He ends up falling in love with Annie, a maid for the second class passengers. The questions is if she will come with him to America and leave the ship when it docks in New York.

There are far more stories including one for third class, one for the captain and officers, and one for the private servants who work for the Mantons.

In terms of realism, the people a Titanic historian would know are all in the crew and are travelling first class and I will say some of them are not portrayed well as they seem really angry. That is one of the main problems with several characters. The other problem is that there might be too many for someone to remember. Another problem is that we don't really see the fates of everyone and that can be a problem. I felt it was a sign that Fellowes eventually knew he had too much to work with.

Also don't expect to see a big Grand Staircase, or the lookouts before hitting the iceberg. Some of the effects are a little moderate. The most major problem in my opinion is how it is filmed. I can keep up with the different points of view, but others may not and I can understand that.

Overall, I liked the series, but I can see why it would be a problem for some.",1334620800,51,3275,4.203821656050955
5054529,5,B0074JOCMC,Don't pay attention to negative reviews.  This is a classic production (much like Downton Abbey) and you have to appreciate classics for their suburb reenactment of the early 1900's & the class system in effect at that time.  The story is romantic & it leaves you waiting for each outcome.,1334534400,2,289,4.76
5054530,3,B0074JOCMC,"The DVD hasn't been released here yet but the 'mini-series' is now over.  It is difficult to call this amalgamation of snippets about an historic tragedy a miniseries because it was spread out so unevenly (3 hours on first night, one hour on second night) and we are now informed that the film is a total of 184 minutes which means that the fourth hour was completely filled with the most distracting and disrupting of commercials.  Why this new version of TITANIC wasn't place on cable television where it could have been enjoyed on one uninterrupted three hour showing is beyond understanding.  Perhaps when the DVD is released and there are no loud and ugly commercials every 5 minutes the story will hold together.

Julian Fellowes, so respected for his writing of such series as Downton Abbey, etc. seems to have the urge to tell the story of the event through quick snippets of personal stories among the passengers - a commendable idea, but when the tiny tales are buried in the almost immediate collision with the iceberg and the attempt to flesh out the story by making it about how tragedy affects people's relationships come as little disconnected pop-ups, it is difficult to care about anybody, much less get to know them well enough to remember them at picture's end. Granted there are some moments before the ship is finished that emphasize the fact that the unsinkable Titanic was rushed to completion before it was safely ready, and those flashbacks to offer some interesting moments.

But basically the story is the same as all the other TITANIC movies - a study about class distinction not only among the peerage of Brits but also the differentiation among first, second and third (steerage) classes - with a hefty dollop of snubbing the crass American passengers. Jon Jones directs this amalgamation of ideas.  There are some brief but tasty moments for actors such as Glen Blackhall (a memorable Paolo) and Antonio Magro (Paolo's brother Mario), Peter McDonald, Steven Waddington, Ruth Bradley Linus Roache and Geraldine Somerville as the Mantons, Toby Jones and Maria Doyle Kennedy, Celia Emrie, James Wilby and Dragos Bucur (the stowaway Russian).  The rest of the cast is so little used that they all but disappear.

The film was apparently shot on digital video.  Some of the effects are fine, but the whole film lacks cohesion - at least on the American release on commercial televsion!  Grady Harp, April 12",1334534400,23,2433,4.897810218978102
5054531,2,B0074JOCMC,"With all of the talent aboard and behind this miniseries, what could have been an extraordinary piece of filmmaking turned out to be a lackluster, dull four hours.  The eagerly awaited Titanic miniseries penned by Julian Fellowes of Gosford Park and Downton Abbey fame, introduced several interesting characters; however, the four-hour allotted time didn't allow any of these characters to develop.  Sketches and black and white outlines of Lords, Ladies, Molly Brown, stewards, maids and an early film star are all we were left with.  If the series had been six or more episodes it may have worked, but alas, four hours was not adequate time to get to know at least twenty major characters.  Let's face it, Fellowes forte is the character study and sadly, he was not allowed to do that in Titanic.

Two performances sparkled - Glen Blackhall as Italian steward, Paolo Sandrini and Jenna-Louise Coleman as Annie Desmond, his love interest. These two young actors brightened the screen and stole every scene in which they appeared.  I dare say that these were the only characters that seemed real and sympathetic.  These talented young actors are ones to watch!  Several great actors like James Wilby, Celia Imrie and David Calder (as Captain Smith) were all but wasted.  The character of Captain Smith basically walked on and then walked off - too bad, for history relates Smith as a remarkable fellow.

The issue of social class was handled rather heavy-handedly, making it seem as if one social class looked upon the other as pariahs.  This may have happened in certain circumstances, but not to the extent the film portrayed it.

Costumes, sets and the ship all looked authentic, but without the flesh and blood characters, just not engaging enough to make the four-hour series entertaining.",1334534400,6,1794,5.0033670033670035
5054562,5,B0074JOCMC,This mini-series is excellent.  Don't fall for the negative reviews listed here.

5054565,3,B0074JOCMC,"Since I first fell in love with the stories surrounding the ill-fated ocean liner at age thirteen, I have read and watched anything I can get my hands on pertaining to the ship. For someone who knows nothing about Titanic, this miniseries by Julian Fellowes may prove illuminating if at times downright misleading, but it is certainly nothing to write home about.

With the suffragist movement sweeping across England, Lord Manton (Linus Roache) has been having trouble keeping his daughter Georgiana (Perditia Weeks) in line. Her most recent escapade has landed her in the local lock-up, and out of desperation he decides that a change of scenery might do her some good. Enlisting the assistance of friend Bruce Ismay (James Wilby) to book Georgiana a first class cabin on the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, he hopes that a stint in New York will put her mind to better uses than feminism. Also on board, in second class, is his employee John Batley (Toby Jones) and his wife Muriel (Maria Doyle Kennedy). It doesn't take long for Muriel to clash with Lady Louisa (Geraldine Somerville) and let out secrets Lord Manton did not want made into public knowledge.

Meanwhile, stewardess Annie (Jenna-Louise Coleman) is being wooed by an Italian last-minute steward Paelo (Glen Blackhall), who fears that once they land in America he may never see her again. The servants of the Grex family share a secret that could endanger them both, an anarchist has set his intentions on another man's wife in steerage, and Second Officer Charles Lightoller (Steven Waddington) must cope with a shuffle in position, as well as the challenges the night presents as it wears on.

Trying to reproduce the tragedy on this topic scaled for television is not an enviable task since it has nowhere near the budget of the big-screen blockbuster. Other series and movies have managed to work around that, but unfortunately this vision is hampered by a rushed narrative that insists on a reset for the first three installments. Carrying the audience through events up to the sinking and then returning to tell a different story hinders us from emotional involvement with already-established characters, and greatly limits our scope, both for the real figures of the disaster and the ship itself. That none of the staterooms, the first class dining room, or even the deck resemble the real thing is less important than the fact that the entire production feels claustrophobic. The rooms are so small, and our interludes kept to so few figures, that we never really get to see what an incredible achievement Titanic truly was, much less how many people were on board. The sinking scenes are suitably crowded, but not the dining rooms. Fellowes' script also makes some truly appalling mistakes, ranging from mixed church sessions on board ship to the behavior and placement of individual figures during the sinking.

Various miniature love stories unfold and there are times we are drawn into the emotions of the moment, but alas, we get to know no one all that well, so when their fate transpires we feel as if we should have felt more than we did. Then too, the lack of a memorable score makes the emotions in many important scenes fall flat. Characters are introduced and then nothing is done with them. Thomas Andrews simply disappears. One officer is manning the wrong boat. The Duff-Gordons are slandered.

Television has needed a decent miniseries on this topic for a long time. But this isn't it. It founders where it should glide, thanks mostly to the problematic structure. It would work better as one cohesive narrative, with events unfolding simultaneously leading up to the sinking and less of a scattered focus. It needed to be built around one or two characters, not a dozen. But alas, instead we are stuck with a miniseries aspiring to be much more than it actually is.",1334534400,6,3859,4.894495412844036
5054566,3,B0074JOCMC,"I watched this on ABC and recorded it without the commercials and watched it again. I had high hopes for this mini-series but I really felt it didn't work for several reasons which had little to do with production values or poor casting. The casting was really quite good and for a television production which didn't have a billion dollar budget and mega special effects, it was really quite well done and rather impressive.
My problem with this production gravitated around issues such as continuity, character development, and something that is virtually insurmountable --- the legend of the Titanic itself.
I think it is difficult to play around with anything that has its basis in fact because too much has been written about the Titanic. While the subject is being overworked right now due to the centennial of the disaster, the event has been in the public eye for decades and got a new life when the wreckage was located and explored 26 years ago. Traveling Titanic shows, books, documentaries, and James Cameron's films have stoked public interest and has provided at the very least a common perception of what occured on April 14-15, 1912.
This production attempts to mimic the formula that has made Downton Abbey a phenomena. Julian Fellowes has written a screenplay that mixes real people and events with fictional characters that represent all classes of people present on the ship and creates multiple personal storylines for his ficticious characters. The problem I had with this is a mini series of less than four hours doesn't allow the viewer to get invested in the characters and their stories as well as an epic disaster. This production also hops all over the Titanic roadmap, bouncing between multiple narratives and the actual sinking. I even think some scenes (or at least parts of scenes) are reused throughout the story. I found myself flipping between flooding corridors and lifeboats being loaded and scenes that had to have occurred earlier. It tends to be somewhat confusing, though I concede that when I viewed it a second time without commercials it did make more sense.
There were some areas where this story managed to remain true to the original event. There was the feistyness of Mrs. Margaret Brown, the model/actress Dorothy Gibson flightiness, the wealthy Philadelphia Wideners private dinner on the night of the sinking, Benjamin Guggenheim was traveling with his mistress, officers Murdoch and Lightoller were accurately portrayed as they were involved loading the lifeboats. All of this added a sense of authenticity to this production which is focused on a fictional study of a class system. The Titanic is an excellent metaphor for the class system that was in place at the time and ultimately resulted in the overwhelming number of third class passengers that died. However,  I really didn't get the way Captain Smith was portrayed. He came off as a pompous incompetent and seemed to be jockeying for the mantle of ultimate villain with J. Bruce Ismay. This is obviously a dramatic conceit to place blame on someone for the disaster, but I am not sure it worked or was even necessary. Titanic sank because there was a convergence of many isolated events/flaws that came together to create the ultimate disaster. Really isn't that dramatic enough?  Something that wasn't supposed to happen did.
In retrospect, I think the thing that sunk this production was the lack of time to develop the characters properly, the choppy editing which really lost me for the most part, and the endless commercial breaks. It was really difficult to feel invested in the fictional characters. The only plot that was simple enough to work was a romance between a maid and an Italian waiter. It was simple and direct so it worked.
The dvd release should be better ---- no commercials, but I think more would have to be done to pull this story together. What works so well with Downton Abbey doesn't seem to work in this instance. Time wasn't on the Titanic's side and the same is true regarding this screenplay. It was far to ambitious given the amount of air time this project was given. There were far too many ficticious characters and far too many story threads to present the rarified world of Titanic given its frenetic pace.",1334534400,14,4254,4.9151599443671765
5054567,1,B0074JOCMC,"I was really looking forward to this TV mini series, sadly it was a great let down when I came to watch it. It may have some appeal to people who like a lot of soap opera fiction mixed with very little factual storyline in the telling of the Titanic story, alas, I am not one of them.

Overall I was very disappointed in ALL aspects of this mini series and do agree with most of the comments made by people who have rated this lowly.

There was a ludicrous & unbelievable scene nearing the end of part 4, the final of the series where Kitty (The Astor's VERY large Airedale) was ""lobbed"" into one of the last lifeboats ""squirming"" under the arm of a female first class passenger, she had her own small dog under her other arm! I realised this was the perfect example why this mini series does not work; it is packed with clumsily & haphazardly added trivial untruths that do not add to the story and really annoy people who appreciate tragic events in history portrayed sympathetically in a factual & realistic style. I feel it is a mark of disrespect to all the poor innocent souls who lost their lives in this avoidable maritime disaster to crassly fictionalize their tragic story; the TRUE story of Titanic does not need to be embellished with such ""drivel"".",1334534400,6,1261,4.454545454545454
5054568,2,B0074JOCMC,"There are some things I can forgive when it comes to TV movies on a tight budget.  I don't expect a special effects extravaganza or even lavish set decoration.  And it's a good thing because you'll get none of that with this version of Titanic.  That being said, a good story with lots of personal involving drama can overcome budgetary production problems.

But unfortunately the movie has terrible editing and worse storytelling. I didn't mind so much that most of the storytelling was fictional.  But you never really have a chance to get involved with the lives of the characters because the movie was so hyper-schizophrenic that it was almost impossible to follow the multiple story lines. I couldn't tell who was doing what or with whom for most of the running time.

One moment the ship is sinking, and the next moment we're back before the ship was launched being told a story of how we got here.  One moment the ship is hitting the iceberg, the next moment we're back on dry land again telling another story about another one of the characters.  One moment an Italian waiter is drowning, the next moment we're back on shore.  I'm not sure but by the time the movie was over, I think it rammed the iceberg at least three times, possibly more.  I lost count.  No wonder it sank.

At least for me, the dialogue was often so muffled it became necessary for me to turn on the closed captions but that may have been a local broadcast problem.  There were a few decent performances and I especially enjoyed Jenna-Louise Coleman as perky maid Annie Desmond, but whatever any of the actors bring to the film is lost in a haze of herky jerky editing and often incoherent dialog.  Save your time and money and book your passage elsewhere.",1334534400,8,1736,4.576051779935275
5054569,1,B0074JOCMC,"The costuming was very nice and that is the only good thing I can say about the first part of the Titanic miniseries. One might say to give it a chance and see the whole series. I won't waste my time. After only the first hour of so, I turned away to something else. I admit that I was spouled with the movie. James Cameron poured so much money and beauty into his work. The sets were small and cheap. As for the acting, as my title states, it was a soap opera on the sea and I found that I did not care if they went down with the ship. I had bookmarked the DVD set to buy when it came out. I will save the money and now remove it from my list. Too bad, I had high hopes. The best words to describe this Titanic is; stink, stank, stunk, sunk.  James Ellison

The real story of the Titanic then, is it sunk at the dock. It was a clear night and the ocean was calm but it stunk like rotten sea weed. It is hard to determine which scene was the worst. Was it the scene where some of the male servants were tossing a woman's prized book in the air? Was it the scene where Mommy reminded her daughter it was late when she was out on the deck with a prospective beau? Was it the scene in the dining room when the scarlet woman was trying to sit at the dinner table with all the other married elite? What really sunk the Titanic?  Was it the script?  Was it the actors? Was it the director? Perhaps, the actors who had a really stinking, sinking, script really could not put their hearts into it. However, there was one thing good about this mini-series: it was a virtual reality trip that would make anybody seasick!  Melinda Ellison",1334448000,3,1627,4.071875
5054570,2,B0074JOCMC,"I really wanted to like this Titanic 4 part mini-series. (All four parts have aired in Canada.) My hopes were that the mini-series would improve after the first episode. It did not. Too many characters, too much jumping around. Mushy story lines that rambled on and then ended for no reason. Computer animation was also mediocre. A few good performances by the actors but overall very poor. If you are hoping to get a little of that upstairs/downstairs ""Downton Abbey"" magic, you won't find it here. Does not work as a drama and has little or no additional historic information. Would love to give this to Walter Murch and ask him edit a decent 90 minutes out of it. As it stands a C- production.",1334275200,19,696,4.576

the director's have done well with the sets have been produced. If some? may think it is a Downton Titanic well that is not bad as ""Downton Abbey""
is well acted and written and by a truly stellar script writer in Julian Fellowes.

The UK edition of the DVD looks like it worthwhile for all the extras, just hope they are on the USA version as so many of my American friends
are so looking forward to it and they will not be Disappointed!",1333756800,6,587,4.104347826086957

8509985,4,B0074JOCMC,"This was a breath of fresh air, after watching the dreadful, never-ending 12 part miniseries Titanic: Blood and Steel.  This 3 hour mini-series took the interesting standpoint of showing four different approaches to the eventual sinking of the doomed liner, from different viewpoints. Characters ,that in the first episode may seem to be exhibiting rather odd behavior, are eventually explained in the three episodes that follow, repeating some events and showing new information not previously exhibited  to put the whole story together, kind of like a cinematic puzzle.  While this may sound annoying to some, I found the whole approach rather enjoyable and the characters very interesting.  Unlike the other miniseries I mentioned, in this series I actually cared for the characters and as such, cared for whether they lived or died. Highly recommended!",1498867200,2,856,5.365671641791045

8509987,4,B0074JOCMC,"Another enjoyable Titanic film, though a bit drawn out. This film was made by the British to Commemorate the anniversary of the ship's sinking. It is a bit long drawn out because it covers events that lead up to it's sailing and sinking that occur outside the ship. However, it does move quickly once it begins and I found I enjoyed it. There is only one thing that threw me for a loop. The British should know more about the Titanic than anyone, right? Look closely and you'll note that on one of the lifeboats in the water, it says, ""S.S. Titanic"" instead of R.M.S. Titanic. I expect that mistake in an American film, such as S.O.S. Titanic, but not in a British Production. Shame on you guys and gals across the pond. What happened?
Otherwise, if you're a fan of Titanic, I suggest you view this film at least once. We decided on buying it to view at our leisure.",1496102400,,866,4.385093167701863
