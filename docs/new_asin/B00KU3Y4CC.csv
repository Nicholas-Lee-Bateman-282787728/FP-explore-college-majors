8661618,2,B00KU3Y4CC,"This is a fictional alternative about the death of the historical character Johnny Ringo. There are about a half dozen or so theories about his death, and this one at best is a spoof of that fact, taking place in the fictional town of Dead Eyes, apparently in Texas by the lone star flag in the background. Sutton Gold Mine mentioned in the film is in York Co. South Carolina. The town they were in had a place called ""Dr. Holliday's"" apparently they filmed on a Tombstone set and didn't bother to change the sign or cover it up.

One of the working titles was ""The Hunt for Billy the Kid"" apparently the made a generic script, with outlaw to be named later. As it was, the plot was bad and the dialogue is guilty of presentism, as Bat Masterson (Lawrence Evenchick) coins the phrase, ""it is what it is.""

The mayor (Ron Tarrant) is comical as he rants about ""crimes against humanity"" making me laugh as ""so bad it is good."" However, it changes from ""so bad it is good"" to just simply bad, slipping occasionally tickling my funny bone...like the church (Police Story) shootout with guys just a few feet away from each other.

Card Player: ""What brings you to Dead Eyes?""
Johnny Ringo impersonator: ""A horse.""

As a serious Western, the film fails. As a spoof of Westerns, it might be watchable...for free. Cult potential if they change the title and watched in Colorado.

No swearing, sex, or nudity. 1 1/2 stars",1458950400,,1412,4.52156862745098
8661619,1,B00KU3Y4CC,The only good part was Michael Pare,1454544000,,35,4.142857142857143
8661620,1,B00KU3Y4CC,"I have been a long time fan of Michael Pare since Eddie and the Cruisers and have seen almost all of his films on dvd up until this one.  It was good to see him again in this film, but it was a very poorly written movie and I can't recommended this to anyone except die hard Michael Pare fans. He's made many other films MUCH better than this one.",1435017600,,347,3.9571428571428573

8661622,1,B00KU3Y4CC,Lame. i loved the part that showed pavement. The old west must have had some long lost secrets to creating paved roads.,1418083200,,119,4.454545454545454
8661623,1,B00KU3Y4CC,Terrible. Acting is poor and unbelievable. Felt choppy and unrealistic.,1417478400,,71,6.2
8661624,1,B00KU3Y4CC,"I like westerns but this one is completely awful, unreal, and boring.  The worst part about it is that my husband purchased it in error.  Don't waste your time or money.",1413158400,2,169,4.419354838709677
8661625,2,B00KU3Y4CC,"This is a poorly done western.  Hollywood premise.  Young Johnny Ringo has someone committing crimes under his name and attempts to clear it with the help of a older Sheriff Bat Masterson who drinks a lot and has been trailing him for a year.  Come on folks -- Masterson was three years younger than Johnny Ringo, he was the kid.  I gave this two stars - one for having Michael Pare in it and the other for not having a bunch of fat old men with big bellies as gunfighters in it.  You don't have to try and make the wardrobe look authentic, but you do have to keep this modern day cowboy hats from Walmarts out of them.  Everybody notices cowboy hats and they did not wear camo hats or stretched and fancy stitched formed leather hats.  I noticed this right away and it really spoiled the film for me.  Also they should have used people more at ease on horses.  Having been around horses you seldom see a rider holding the reins in both hands outward unless they are beginners.  While most of the actors appear stiff Pare and Mike Tarp seemed to seem more at ease with their roles.",1410393600,,1081,4.306930693069307
