8284100,5,B001BPB5WU,"A funny story about a dysfunctional family that put aside their troubles to give Olive a chance at the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" title. Olive is a little girl about 9 years old who is positive about winning this title, even though her chances are slim.  The family bands together to overcome their own problems and help her.  It is a very rewarding and funny story.",1293840000,,362,4.553846153846154
8284101,3,B001BPB5WU,"Six family members go on a Volkswagen bus journey to a California beauty contest for little girls. The six are the close-to-normal seven year old girl; her harried mother; her frenetic, booster-type father; a grandfather with a heart of gold, a cocaine habit and a lewd streak; a teenage loopy son who has taken a months-long vow of silence; and the wife's depressed brother who has just been released from a mental hospital after a botched suicide attempt. These weirdos all have issues with each other and life, and like dodge-em cars are bouncing off one another. On their odyssey almost everything that could go wrong, does go wrong.
 Will this dysfunctional family get its act together, or will they descend deeper into familial chaos? A funny movie that avoids cheap sentimentality, it's a journey of discovery for the family members, but I think for this script it might be giving it too much credit to claim that. It's more like a trip in which screwballs lose their edginess and become semi-normal.
 Alan Arkin as the grandfather is great, but Greg Kinnear as the father would have been better if he had avoided the over-the-top, clich-ish manic behavior. He's too much like a frenzied buzz saw.
  You'll either love the movie, hate it or tolerate it and realize that not all flicks can be great. A three star effort with some good yuks.",1218844800,,1346,4.763948497854077
