3531140,4,B001DIC82Q,"This dvd was cool. Not at all what I expected, but it was real fun to watch. I am glad they finally showed some real detail on the actual mechanical side of the bike rebuilding. Usually these are just about ""bikers"" and bars. But this was real interesting to waych and well blended with real life.",1261958400,,297,4.321428571428571
3531141,5,B001DIC82Q,"Superb DVD, bike nuts with an infectious love of british iron.  lots of in-depth knowledge on display, people not scared to get greasy working on them, but the DVD is actually a story about real (if highly idiosyncratic) people and their passion for the bikes and their lifestyle.

I learned a lot, and loved the film, highly recommended.",1242777600,4,338,4.810344827586207
3531142,5,B001DIC82Q,"Did not know what to expect from this video but being a US person owning old Brit iron I could not resist seeing it. The video is about the bike (only old Triumphs) but really it is more about the people who own them. Some of the people in this video are more likely to cut and chop the old brit iron than restore them to their original ""glory"" and that is simply less attractive to me than appreciating the bikes as they were. Not that it is right or wrong. The DVD is excellently done and the producers are to be congratulated.",1233705600,7,529,4.145631067961165
3531143,5,B001DIC82Q,"Guess what people, there is more to motorcycles and motorcycle enthusiasts than fat, middle class harley riders. Brittown is a fantastic film about guys who love classic british bikes. The storyline focus is on Meatball building his latest bike while at the same time following him and his buddys as they mx race, road race and desert ride all on vintage brit and euro bikes, with a pretty good sound track moving it a long. Check this movie out, and check out Choppertown, the first film by the producers of Brittown.  You won't be dissapointed.",1222473600,3,546,4.747368421052632

8293538,3,B001DIC82Q,"Just a carefree, low budget film. Don't expect too much and you can find some
grains of entertainment to enjoy.",1391731200,,111,4.6
8293539,5,B001DIC82Q,"Wonderful little documentary movie about 'living the life' of a core motorcycle enthusiast.  Everything that reality TV aspires unsuccessfully to be, this is honest and about real people that don't think too much of themselves but everything about what they care about.  I bought this after seeing a borrowed dvd so that I can watch it annually and enjoy it each and every time.",1383436800,,378,4.890625
8293540,5,B001DIC82Q,Great DVD that shows a whole other culture with respect to Bike Builders.  Meatball keep doing what you doing for as they say if you enjoy what you are doing you'll never work a day in your life.  Can't wait to see his next build.,1372291200,,230,4.088888888888889
8293541,4,B001DIC82Q,"If you love Brit iron, this is a must have. If you love bikes put this in your library today.",1359244800,,93,3.7
8293542,5,B001DIC82Q,"Brought this as a present for my Dad who had previously borrowed it off a friend but wanted his own copy too.
A fantastic documentary film but without the normal boring bits of a documentary! I don't even have any interest in bikes its just my Dad but we all sat down and watched it Christmas day. Basically the story of a group of motorcycle enthusiasts and their love for British bikes....

I searched everywhere for this DVD in the UK, but had to order it from the US in the end...needn't have worried the shipping time was next to nothing and reasonably priced. We thought it would arrive after Christmas early Feb but I got to us before the 25th Dec. WOW better than some UK sellers.",1357257600,,688,4.375
8293543,5,B001DIC82Q,"I was intrigued by the premise but did not know what to expect when I put this on.  The film follows ""Meatball"" through his life of building, racing, and enjoying classic british motorcycles, mainly Triumphs.  The soundtrack was great and the movie is just an all around feel good time.  I put it on every once in a while and it's always fun to watch.  If you can't have as much fun as these guys at least you can enjoy watching them have fun.  5 stars.",1352332800,,453,4.22093023255814
8293544,1,B001DIC82Q,If you're looking for a shameless self promotion of some California hipsters crappy band then this is the DVD for you.  If you also want to learn how to pay other people to work on your bike for you then also the right DVD for you.  The people are so out of touch with real britm scanners and vintage racers.  A true insult and slap inj the face to the vintage culture.,1328313600,,369,4.097222222222222
8293545,5,B001DIC82Q,"Proof of the benefits of Independant film-making: honest, humble, and full of real character. Just regular folks doing what they enjoy without hype or distortion of any identifiable kind. If you like Classic British Twins, California, and a good band and music that's not ""processed"", its an enjoyable DVD.",1290729600,,306,5.26530612244898
