8599157,5,B00DYEBLWU,"Get ready to ""WOOHP"" it up with teen dreams Sam, Clover, and Alex in the second season of ""Totally Spies"", the hit girl-powered action series as seen on Cartoon Network.  Sure, these gals may face some typical social-based problems, but they're nothing compared to the vile villains they encounter.  The first volume ""Secret Agents"" has the first 13 season two episodes on two discs such as:

""Starstruck"" - When their favorite soap opera star is reportedly missing, the girls tell their boss Jerry they have to do something about it immediately.  Jerry thinks it's not much of a mission, but the girls prove him wrong when the actor is being held captive by an obsessed fan !
""Evil Hair Salon"" - A strange new chain of hair salons are abducting people and our girls must investigate before it's too late.
""The Yuck Factor"" - Jerry is behaving very strangely and it turns out he's being controlled by a bad guy in his brain.  Our lovely ladies have no choice but to go inside their boss's body and defeat the fiend controlling Jerry as long as Alex can keep her cool after dissecting a frog.
""Here Comes the Sun"" - There's an alarming increase in temperatures around the globe, and it must have a strange connection to a freaky new sunblock lotion.
""Green with N.V."" - Men are being hypnotized with a strange new cologne that draws them to one certain woman: Natalie Valentine, the woman behind this plan all along !
""Boy Bands Will Be Boy Bands"" - When the girls' favorite boy band goes missing they immediately investigate.  The members of the band turn out seemingly fine, but eventually, it is revealed that their identities are being stolen by a rival boy band !
""Mommies Dearest"" - Tim Scam returns and this time he kidnaps the girls' mothers by luring them into his new ""spa"" for Mother's Day.
""First Brat"" - The girls are babysitting Madison, the President's daughter, while the Prez is out fishing with Jerry.  At first, putting up with Madison's antics was one thing, but then another problem rises when she's kidnapped !
""W.O.W."" - Women are behaving rather furiously and it turns out that their warrior instincts including Sam's are kicking in at a rapid pace.

You'll need the other volume of season two to complete this season of the girls from Beverly Hills with awesome adventures, by the way.  And don't forget that the first season is also available on DVD, and coming soon, season three !",1384214400,,2407,4.671394799054373
