7884854,2,6305183139,"This movie is OK action movie. It deals with a FBI agent or some government agent trying to stop a government coup. Jack Scalia plays the agent who is enjoying a social function when it's taken over by miltary terrorists. Of course Jack Scalia saves the day, gets the girl and saves the day/world!
This DVD is rated R for violence,murder,death ,partial nudity and swearing. The DVD transfer is pathetic. The only extras are a trailer, a actor bio and a very bad scene selection!!
buy this movie if you are fans of Jack Scalia(a B grade actor who was big in the past) ,or if you love B grade action movies or just a pathetic DVD transfer!!my advice rent it .But this DVD may be hard to rent and or buy!! So if you want this movie, buy it online here at Amazon!!",991008000,6,760,4.284722222222222
