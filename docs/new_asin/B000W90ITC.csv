8221728,5,B000W90ITC,Affair In Monte Carlo was released in 1953. It starred Merle Oberon as an older woman in love with a gambler. Old fashioned love story. Fans of Merle Oberon will like this the most.,1476316800,,181,4.352941176470588
8221729,1,B000W90ITC,Very disappointed that this was a black and white version of a Technicolor film. The quality of the image and sound was also very poor.,1343174400,3,135,4.44
8221730,1,B000W90ITC,"""Affair In Monte Carlo"", based on Stefan Zweig's ""24 Hours In The Life Of A Woman,"" tells the story of a rich widow who feels compassion, then falls in love with a younger man who is also a compulsive gambler. This material is perhaps too esoteric for most modern audiences, so you have to force yourself to put it all in historical perspective.

The cast is headed by glamorous Merle Oberon, handsome Richard Todd and elegant Leo Genn. It was directed by Victor Saville and originally photographed in Technicolor by the gifted Christopher Challis. Though the film is quite old-fashioned in its loopy romanticism, it is quite watchable as a kind of travelogue-romance which they don't make any more and a fun time-killer. The only thing that truly gets in the way is the over-the-top musical score.

Unfortunately, the quality of this Synergy DVD release is absolutely wretched. One can hardly believe such a poor print could exist in these days of High Def and digital restoration. Think Alpha Video at its worst and you get the picture. The film is not presented in its original color; it looks instead like a washed out b&w kinescope from the 1950's, or as if it had been videotaped from a local TV station in the olden days of UHF. There are actually fades in the middle of scenes where commercial breaks were probably placed. And there are scratches aplenty. To make matters worse, the print, which had been cut from its original 90 minutes to 75 for its American release, has been further cut to 65 in this Synergy DVD. There are many obvious gaps in the story.

I have purchased - for a dollar - at Wal-Mart bargain DVDs that were far superior to this Synergy offering of $10. ""Road To Bali"" and ""One-Eyed Jacks"" were two of them, obviously struck from their original Laser Disc releases. ""Road"" was in spectacular 3-strip Technicolor and ""Jacks"" was widescreen, though not anamorphic.

Synergy should be ashamed of themselves for daring to charge any money at all for this kind of inexcusable quality. This should be at best a free download, or just not bother with such an appalling print. My advice is to wait for some other company like Kino Video to do justice to this minor bit of romantic fluff. The Challis Technicolor photography and gorgeous Monte Carlo locales and Casino interiors should be worth the higher price. After all, this is the age of Blu-Ray, not VHS.",1339200000,6,2381,4.716346153846154
8221731,1,B000W90ITC,"OMG-so many questions:1) How did this book get written (based on 24 Hours In A Woman's Life), how did this get produced? What is the clinical diagnosis/ definition of the mental illnesses portrayed by the three main characters? A woman dumps her fiance after borrowing 2K pounds sterling from him to give to a complete stranger who she spends oh 24-48 hours with, in which we find out nothing about either character except that they are insane. This was an eye opener, I always thought older movies could never be this stupid. MST3K material.",1278720000,2,542,4.776595744680851
