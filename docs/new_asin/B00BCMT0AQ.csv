I have seen it 4 times and could watch it again and again.",1362787200,4,163,3.7941176470588234
5578487,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Heard about this documentary months ago and couldn't wait to see it; I was not disappointed. Excellent overview of the career of a true legend, and one of music's most compelling and contemptible characters. There was a time when rock stars like Ginger ruled the earth, leaving a path of dysfunctional destruction in their wake, while producing some of the greatest music the world has ever known.",1362355200,37,397,4.940298507462686
5578488,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"I loved this documentary. Ginger Baker is both a crazy genius and a train wreck. Nevertheless, this film humanizes the Cream drummer, warts and all. You end up both loving and hating him, yet you can't look away. His musical genius is readily apparent. What is unique is that the filmmaker got as close to him as anyone could. The interviews with Baker and his family and friends are wonderful. The editing of the film is superb. Great use of animation in moving the story forward plus tons of archival footage and great music. If you're a music fan of a certain age, don't miss this film!",1362182400,75,589,4.514018691588785
5578489,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Just watched the video stream and can't wait for the dvd. A very interesting story of one of the most influential drummers of our time. Being a Cream fan all my life, I lost track of Ginger after the Gurvitz-Army period and had no clue of the Africa experience, but this film fills in the history gaps and with great fresh interviews from family members and some of the best musicians that worked with and admired him.  Thanks to Jay for the film and thanks to Ginger for forming Cream!",1362009600,7,486,4.4

5578498,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"I really enjoyed this documentary. I have always been a fan of Cream but didn't know much about their drummer until watching this. Though it did nothing to change or diminish my appreciation for their music, I definitely see the band much differently than I did before. The most poignant moment of the movie (for me) was when they asked his South African wife if he was a good father to her children. Her reaction made me squirm.

In case you haven't read other reviews on the video, don't watch it around kids unless coarse language doesn't bother you.",1467072000,,553,4.585858585858586

'Ole Ginger must have a 6 pack a day habit for decades and is still here, making a pest out of himself. Met him years ago and he was a SNOB then and apparently has not changed over the years.

5578502,3,B00BCMT0AQ,"As other reviewers have noted, this film is a mixed bag.  The music is very good, often great.  The interviews of people other than Baker are interesting.  Baker himself is interesting, but frequently not in a good way.  He comes across as one of the most intentionally unpleasant and obnoxious people in the galaxy.  All arguments have two sides but this film leaves viewers with the impression that the problems Baker had with Jack Bruce are more the fault of Baker than Bruce.  I liked the film overall but am glad it was not longer, as it would have been difficult for me to stomach the uncouth behavior of Baker.",1462752000,,617,4.5636363636363635

5578510,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"I must admit I really had little inclination to watch a film about Ginger Baker, but with a life-long interest in music curiosity got me.  First, I didn't know much about Baker other than he will forever be remembered as the drummer for Cream.  Cream's legend, for I imagine many reasons, has always been much more outsized than my own interest in the band so even as it loomed large it wasn't much of a draw to me.  This film, however, grabbed me immediately as I imagine anyone who see's the opening ""violence"" will understand.

Ginger Baker, I immediately understood, had a much larger story.  He was near the middle of his seventies when the movie starts and he seemed fragile, but fiesty as he was in his twenties.  He had the same anti-social side which has plagued him his entire life though I believe he wouldn't necessarily admit to that.  While he was a total perfectionist when it came to playing his instrument his entire life had been quite the opposite.  It's a rather sad undercurrent yet he is a kind of survivor.  That's not to say many others in his orbit haven't paid a heavy price, particularly his wives and children.  Still, his musical journey is peppered with great successes and some radical choices in living in between.  As a story it certainly entertains even with the high pain quotient and absurdity.  The rough journey made Baker look 60 in his 30's so, in a way, he's always looked pre-maturely aged and dishoveled and his present look is like his actual age caught up more with his appearance.
Initially I must say I wondered why a budding journalist was drawn to Ginger Baker, more or less, get his career started.  I imagine it was not unlike scaling a mountain peak thus because the mountain is still there why not?  The journalist did an admirable job, in fact making a very professional and informative documentary which also entertains. I learned so much even though I consider myself at 56 to be a rock music lover who grew up an avid listener.

In the end it's hard to feel sorry for Baker even though he's alienated so many and went through multiple financial windfalls.  I guess I just wonder about what's the most important missing thing that could have made a difference...or may even still do so?  I have my own opinion on that which if you watch you will likely also have.  One thing comes out much more clearly after watching and that's the fact Ginger Baker is the greatest drummer, muscially and technically, of the greatest era of rock music.  I will attempt to remember this over all of the lesser stuff.  A great film on a very difficult subject, highly recommended especially for music fans in my generation.",1454457600,,2662,4.611464968152866
5578511,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"As the title said I watched it twice the day I got it. I have been around all the time this guy was making music but didn't experience a whole lot of Gingers pre-Cream days which was very interesting. I also got the Masters of Reality album Sunrise on the Sufferbus in the early 90's and have great respect for the album.........Gingers drumming on that one is really remarkable also so get it if you haven't heard it yet. I knew he was into African rythms (arent all rythms African based?) but didn't know of his acutally living there for long periods of time and didn't know about his family. With all of that it starts out, proceeds through and ends on a comic note. Very good in my opinion.",1449273600,,694,4.346153846153846

5578517,5,B00BCMT0AQ,What an amazing video! The video does a very good job telling Ginger Baker's story.  It shows his personality.  The interviews with his friends and associates are well done.  Ginger Baker was in the drug wars. Maybe he lost.,1438905600,,224,4.6923076923076925
5578518,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"TITLE APPROPRIATE: BEWARE MR BAKER-- Ginger Baker remained for most of his adult life a veey unhappy man. He took his anger out on others and alienated almost everyone he worked with or tried to work with. He understood more about drums, methods, styles, production, and sheer performance than any of his contemporaries. He was NOT over rated. He was under rated it seems as not one person had a word of negative comment on his musical knowledge. The problem is he had a serious personality /DEMON issue that was played up in the film (PROVKED mainly unfairly) by the film maker. If the man is somehwat edfy and uncooperative the film maker forces the issue ""Take off Your glasses"" ""WHY"" ""Well its impolite"" ""People would like to see you"". Do you ask BOB DYLAN to remove his sunglasses? It aint gonna happen. It's actually kind of rude. Ginger died not long ago. I wish the film maker would have had more insight and knowledge of Mr Bakers history. He focused on his family life and came away eith LITTLE of real value except to show a broken and damaged life. We all have demons.  Try doing a documentary on JIMMY PAGES Life and there would be jus tas many demons. Same for many others who had something to contribute as an artist. I hgave it four stars sicne there really aren't any other long form interviews with Ginger Baker. He was really inaccessible to TV for the most part. He was not a publicity hound like the modern pop star. He was interested in ,making good and real music. The documentarian failed to really appreciate this.",1438128000,,1539,4.555956678700361

5578534,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"Being a huge fan, I had to see this movie, and I am glad I did.  Very entertaining stuff.  It made me realize how little I know of the man, and what an interesting personality is there. Bulgher probes mightily, risking much as he interviews and assembles Baker's life story. The oft-publicized broken nose from the trailer notwithstanding, there is some kind of forced friendship between the two that somehow makes the reluctant Baker talk candidly about it all. It is a fascinating tale that spans everything from the obvious musical brilliance, recognized at an early age, through unparalleled success and worldwide fame, to being a man without a country, broken both physically and financially. The story is told through interviews and some priceless video and photography, and is also peppered with great little cartoon inserts, very well done. At the time of the interviews, Baker had not touched his drums in months, he said. I feel certain the movie was made and interviews were granted for financial reasons, as Baker needs the money, but is decidedly anti-media and prefers a reclusive existence.  It is Baker's musical philosophies that interested me the most (and he has plenty to say about all manner of musicians and influences and is quite content to name names where needed), although how he has conducted his life is an awfully rich ride. This is debauchery at its most robust, folks.  To say he is resilient is a vast understatement, and I understand he is playing and touring again (in 2015) in a three piece jazz combo.  Carry on, sir!",1435622400,,1554,4.871212121212121

5578556,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"I absolutely fell in love all over again with Ginger Baker, whom I loved best of all out of the Cream threesome in the mid-late sixties. Now, in MY sixties, I look back with such fondness at the band and their music. I found out all about Baker's love of African music (contemporary African music being my number one favorite--Habib Koite, Mutukudzi, Ongala, Oryema, Kidjo, ALL Zimbabwe music, etc. etc) and watched him jam in Africa (there's a DVD). Africa put him and his drums on a whole nother level!!

I  also learned about his childhood, the depths of his mad genius, and his difficulties with other men (band mates, his son, Bulger the documentarian, etc.) --all stemming from his anger, I think, over the loss of his father when he was four and a half. In Ayurvedic terms, Baker is pure pitta/vatta: fire, rhythm, volitivity, creativity, art. He is truly a djinn, a magical spirit more fire than flesh, pure inspiration, vibrating on a unique level.

I am amazed to read various reviews of this film which sound quite judgmental of the man. I can't judge Ginger Baker, but I can appreciate the complexities and the fearlessness of his approach to life. He has an awful lot of love for animals and for children.

An astounding genius of a drummer and a hell of a vital human being.",1427673600,,1288,4.611353711790393

5578575,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Over the years, I've seen bits and pieces here and there about Ginger Baker, all of it bad. The impression gathered was that he's a belligerent malcontent, constantly looking for something toward which or whom he can vent his rage.  One time, he actually beat up Jack Bruce out of sheer viciousness over something petty. This documentary expands on that impression, with lots of anecdotes that lead one to the conclusion that, despite his nonpareil skill on the drums, he was a ridiculous human being whose character flaws eclipsed his usefulness in a band. He was impossible to work with, sometimes a drug-addled lunatic with an exaggerated sense of his stake in the world. There are always good drummers, so why would anyone in need of a drummer settle for this raging bedlamite? Well, the answer was, they wouldn't, and they didn't.  In one segment of this film, Eric Clapton describes how Baker just showed up one day and took a seat as the drummer for Blind Faith.  He had not been invited.  Blind Faith made one album: Clapton left after that and went to the United States.  So while some out here in our ordinary lives might want to make some allowance for it as some side effect of being a genius, people in closer proximity to him did not.  This behavior is not some aspect of true GENIUS.  Sometimes there's a special relationship some people achieve within a particular craft.  In this case, Baker had an affinity for the drums.  But he's no genius.  He's a person who filled a void, but he wasn't the only one who could have filled it.

Lacking even a modicum of self-awareness, Baker lived life like he was driving a machine-gun mounted Humvee through a war zone, angry at everything.  Baker never felt a need to reign in his behavior, not for anyone else in the world, including his own children. So, for Mr. Baker, karma was a boa constrictor, wrapping itself ever tighter around him, until we find him as he is today, as revealed in this documentary.  There he is, on his ranch in Africa, an embittered curmudgeon, in a lounge chair, sucking on an oxygen mask, obviously suffering from some sort of pulmonary disease, probably emphysema.  He's a dilapidated, broke -- and almost broken -- human being, but still dedicated to his disdain for people and self-restraint.  Toward the end of the documentary, he strikes the director of this very film in the face with a cane.  The offense of the director?

The director stated that he'd be interviewing other people from Baker's life.  Baker objected.  He struck the director hard enough to draw blood.  What a creature.

This documentary is highly recommended.  Not only will it shed light on one twisted human being, you might admit that even stellar talent can not excuse a plain rotten soul.  I never followed what happened to this man after Cream was dismantled.  Admittedly, he played drums on one the greatest rock albums of that decade --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disraeli-Gears/dp/B0000067L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disraeli Gears</a>&nbsp;-- but I'm not sure how critical his contribution was to my appreciation of it.  Any other really good drummer might have done just as well, though that roll in ""White Room"" on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wheels-of-Fire/dp/B0000067L3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wheels of Fire</a>&nbsp;(the other magnificent Cream album) -- a contribution for which Baker is quite proud; I've seen him mention it on more than one occasion -- really does seem to have a special place in that arrangement.  What he failed to recognize is that talent is as much a gift from nature than anything else.  Baker has never learned to contemplate that simple fact and instead let his ego rule.  The result was a mess of a life.

5578594,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Really enjoyed this film. I'm old enough to remember and love this musician from ""Cream'' days, and his incredible sounds. He was a troubled character, but definitely his own man, his own worst enemy, and a one in a million gifted talent. Great talent seems to so often go hand in hand with inner torment (not always but often), and huge success can seem to deepen the eccentricities since the penalties for misbehavior are lighter or non existent. You can't help but feel for Mr. Baker even though he can be deeply unlikable in a lot of scenes in the movie. You also feel compassion for his family and friends who had to deal with him (and some who ceased to deal with him). But it says a lot about him that several people still sing his praises as an influential artist.",1417132800,,772,4.443661971830986

5578605,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Ginger Baker is a unique musician and artist. i can't fault anyone that has this much talent no matter how tragic their lives appear from the outside. this video was very revealing and showed me a side of this man that i really didn't want to know. i've been into Cream and Baker's style since 68/69 (a drummer for 3 years by that time). i typically don't like to read about musician's personal lives as it might affect my appreciation of their art.

this documentary was so well done that i kept insisting that family members watch it including my 80something year old parents. Baker allows all to be revealled and the man has no shame; not sure how that's done but somehow this personality trait has allowed him to create a drumming style like no other. so there are lessons to be learned here which is that although art is a beautiful thing it can come at a high cost (not a new sentiment of coarse). both his drug additiction and ability to distance himself from his family seem to be driving forces in his style which on the surface seems bombastic. only as a drummer can you understand how drumming can be such an agressive instrument and channel incredible energy into music. drumming like this is not for the casual listener.

5578619,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Truly wonderful and unflinching biopic about Ginger Baker, best known as the legendary drummer for Cream.  The film provides a stark and unrelenting look at a flawed musical genius in the twilight of his career (and possibly life).  A multitude of interviews with family, ex-wives, contemporaries and former band mates adds to the complete picture of Baker.  Especially insightful are the snippets with Eric Clapton, who becomes more emotionally expressive than I have ever seen him when discussing his relationship with Baker and Jack Bruce- and Baker's revelations about his friendships with drumming idols including Max Roach and Elvin Jones.  The graphics and animations are amazing and punctuate the storyline to great effect.

While Baker is truly not someone you'd want to marry or have kids with, or even partner with in a band, the irascible sage he's become is quite intriguing.  Extremely entertaining film.",1404864000,,918,5.296551724137931

The man is truly a one off. There is neither any denying that Ginger Baker is an extraordinarily talented musician, likely the greatest jazz and rock drummer of all time, nor is there any denying that he is a narcissistic sociopath, with a crippling addiction to heroin for many years. While he built temples of percussion perfection, he tore down relations with everybody he interacted with. The stories he tells of his life may seem far fetched, but when ex-band mates, ex-wives, acquaintances, former business partners, and even his own children corroborate the often chillingly fantastic tales, you begin to see the insecurity, the madness, the lack of common sense...and the sheer genius, as well. If you enjoy rock, or jazz music, the music or recording industry, or just very adventurous tales of psychotic pioneers traveling the world, you should watch ""Beware of Mr. Baker"".",1400544000,,1127,5.032085561497326

Having grown up with Cream and Blind Faith I always loved the music but had no idea about Ginger Baker beyond the fact of his reputation as a most legendary, world famous drummer. This production is so well done that I plan to buy it for posterity's sake! It's just too good to only watch once. The story of Ginger Baker is told to be very complex, tumultuous, and exhilarating. His relationships with Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton are explored and the commentaries by these guys plus many others provides amazing perspective. I really appreciate Eric Clapton's humanity towards his friend and colleague, Ginger Baker, even though there were so many challenges to their shared paths in life. You just have to watch this film to understand. I do have one minor complaint and this is not a spoiler by any means. You will be scratching your head and saying, ""What the f___!"" when you hear this almost La La type music as one crazily-depicted life situation seems to be resolved. I was kind of incredulous to hear this crap music thrown into so much otherwise amazing rocking sublime music. It felt crazy to have to endure it.

what i most regret was that the musical parts of this documentary -- the concert footage, the studio videos, the television appearances -- are truncated and inadequate. aside from his tremendous musicality, baker could literally pound any other drummer into submission with his fiery stamina. we never get a concert segment that allows us to experience that power, and we don't get enough of a taste of other drummers to appreciate his specific gifts. it's all far too gossipy and tabloidal, and in the end a bit depressing.",1396396800,2,849,4.855172413793103

The film fills in details and confirms the suspicions I had about him.  There is no doubt he is a creative genius and if one was ever in doubt it becomes clear in watching this film.  At first I was a bit put off by the use of animation, but after a while I ended up enjoying it and I particulary like the fact that Mr. Baker's drumming was often in the background.

The guy is pretty incredible in many ways (some not so good).  But he is what he is and doesn't pretend to be anything else.

For anyone who is seriously interested in 60's music, influence of Afican music on western music, or drumming in particular, this film is a gem.",1389225600,,853,4.133333333333334

First, I will admit that although I'm a drummer, I've never quite understood the fuss over Ginger Baker, to me he's just one of many successful drummers, and I think a lot of those who are much less famous are much better than he is.  Nonetheless, I was completely drawn into this movie.  His personal life is, was, and always will be a shambles, and even his daughter's comment about her parents' attempt to abort her ""it's too bad it didn't work"" speaks volumes about what a horrible father he was.  It is to Ginger's credit that he allowed the movie to be released as it was, with the numerous stories from his children about how emotionally and psychologically abusive he was to them.  I don't know why I was so drawn into this movie about such a terrible person, but I found it fascinating, which speaks to the skill of the filmmaker.",1389052800,,894,4.393939393939394

5578667,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"This is a great documentary about one of the best drummers ever in my opinion. He ranks up there with the likes of John Bonham, Keith Moon, Mitch Mitchell, and every other famous drummer in history. I prefer not to call Mr. Ginger Baker a ""rock"" drummer because he claims to be more of a ""jazz"" drummer instead, and I certainly wouldn't want to have him hunt me down for making that mistake. To understand my fear of this exceptional drummer, you need to see this film. Ginger Baker was (and maybe still is) a crazy guy.

This film covers a good portion of Ginger's life, from childhood to his fame to his later years as a well seasoned all around drummer. It includes interviews from Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten), Marky Ramone, and many people from Ginger's past. It's a story about how he came to be, how his drumming developed, how some jazz drummers influenced him, and an inside look into his personal life (one he might not want you to see). Included in this movie are clips of old performances and fairly new ones, and really cool animated sequences that truly make this documentary a work of art. A must-have for all drummers, music fans, Ginger Baker wannabes, and anyone who loves kick-ass classic rock n roll drumming.

We love ya Ginger. Hope this film (and my review of it) do you justice. If not, please don't hunt me down and kill me.",1387238400,,1377,4.504
5578668,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"Lots of great footage and unlike some viewers, I loved the animation. Not only were they great drawings, it kept the film interesting visually which is difficult with a patchwork of interviews-otherwise you get only talking heads or the now-cliche Ken Burns photo montages. Also deftly illustrated (sorry about the pun) his early years- partly why he became as violent as he is.

Loved the Fela section-they could've talked so much more about the impact of African music on almost every form of popular music- as well the cultural and racial aspects. From David Byrne, Paul Simon, even Adam Ant-there are direct influences- some say rip-offs- of African musical styles.

Also, I was really surprised that despite the (hilarious) intro and outro by John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols) there was no real discussion of his work with PIL!! What a huge waste-- the old guard of 60s meets punk & post-punk icon.  Lydon was part of a movement that often trashed the 60s music legacy along with corrupt and decadent rockstars as irrelevant washed-up geezers.  There was a lot of general hippie-hate of early punk, and here was Mr Rotten working with (and revering) a '60s supergroup' drummer; rock 'royalty'-- the very caricature of a decadent Rock Star.  What a glaring omission. The director missed a great opportunity to look at a very interesting transitional era in music and culture, especially since Punk put a lot of older rockstars on the defensive, provoking some to produce identity-crisis-type ""new wave"" albums to try to fit into the new musical & cultural trends.

Unfortunately, the film focuses too much on the Mad Genius cliche and lots of rubbernecking at the wreckage of his life. This schadenfreude-ish reality tv style needs to die once and for all. It starts to make you feel that the conversations belong in therapy and not in front of a camera. Plus the director and Lydon revive the hoary old abusive monster/genius cliche; forgetting that many geniuses are actually decent people and that many damaged unhinged people have no talent whatsoever.

For me, perhaps the most telling moments are when Baker describes Clapton as his closest friend, yet Clapton himself sounds like he keeps himself a good safe distance from the man. Also, when we meet Baker's current wife, who looks like she's stuck in a really bad marriage and she silently looks down a lot. When she's asked if Baker's a good father, there is the l-o-n-g-e-s-t pause from her, really uncomfortable. The interviewer practically has to practically give the answer himself. I felt like she was with him for lack of other options to raise her children,or perhaps she was too scared to leave. Yikes.

The guy hated it and said this is what happens when musicians are just playing without listening to each other. Bingo. That's what Cream was like (to my ears, not yours I know), and that's my overall impression of Ginger Baker.

5578693,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"BEWARE OF MR BAKER is a 2012 documentary of Ginger Baker by Jay Bulger, a journalist who wrote a Rolling Stone article of the legendary English rock drummer and later was able to interview him at length on his South African estate. Centered around Baker's recollections, the documentary proceeds through his life chronologically. We start his discovery of jazz records as a child, his early career as a musician and then the acclaimed groups of the 1960s that cemented his reputation (Cream, Blind Faith and Ginger Baker's Air Force). Much time is spent on his time in Nigeria in the early 1970s, when he played with Fela Kuti and ran a state-of-the-art recording studio in Lagos.

The documentary pretty much declares the mid-1970s on as the downhill period of Ginger Baker's life. From then on, tax problems, failed marriages and being deported overshadow what little musical productivity he had left. Even before then, he is painted as a fantastic drummer but a very flawed human being. Some of the rock musicians here (Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, Neil Peart, Stewart Copeland, Steve Winwood and many others) praise his technical skills, but there's just as much complaint that he is impossible to work with. Interviews with his ex-wives, sister and son depict a man who was always prepared to unroot himself and abandon his loved ones. The greatest example of Ginger Baker's unlikeability is the opening scene of the documentary: when Jay Bulger tells him that he now intends to go off and interview others for their side of the story, Baker strikes him in the face with his cane.

This is generally a well-rounded documentary that covers all the bases. In spite of the filmmaker's wish to exaggerate the poignant nature of Baker's career arc, the drummer himself admirably refuses to go along. However, I had a few minor complaints while watching the documentary. One is that Jay Bulger is a young American man of the ""bro"" type, which sorely jives with the Britain-Nigeria axis that is the foundation of Baker's career. Happily, he stays out of the way for the most part. Some of the animations that were made just for the documentary are silly, and there is such an abundance of archival footage that there was arguably no need for something extra.",1381363200,,2253,4.879895561357702

5578697,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"Rock biopics aren't to everyone's taste, but I generally quite like them, and this one benefits from having as its subject a genuine rock legend about whom little is generally known and there is a real story to tell. Ginger Baker is best known as the wild-eyed, mad-haired, flame-bearded drummer with `60s supergroup Cream, but he has roamed the musical (and geographical) landscape before and since, leaving a heroin-tinged trail of destruction wherever he has gone, alienating pretty much the whole world in the process.

Documentary maker Jay Bulger himself has an interesting story to tell: of how he blagged his way into Ginger Baker's now necessarily reclusive world by posing as a journalist with Rolling Stone, thereby scoring an interview which he then ingeniously managed to get Rolling Stone to publish, launching his own rock career. In this film Bulger returns to Baker and, despite being tempted in early exchanges, manages to keep himself well out of the frame for most of the rest of the film.

What Bulger comes up with is a cleverly constructed biopic which pivots around a series of filmed interviews with Baker, now a frail old man with osteoarthritis, and more or less in penniless exile on a South African ranch. His eyes may be dim but Baker has lost none of his irrascibility - Bulger sustains a nasty bleeding nose at one point for suggesting he will be talking to former band mates - and is a magnetic subject. The back story - which includes Alex Korner, the Graham Bond Organisation, Cream, Blind Faith, Public Image Limited and of course Ginger Baker's Air Force, as well as a number of drum duels with legends of the jazz scene is filled in around the interviews with stills and archive footage, interviews with every rock luminary you could possibly ask for, and a series of ingenious animations to fill those parts of the narrative where cameras weren't on hand. Pristine recordings of Baker's distinctive drumming accompany and occasionally punctuate the narrative: the superimposition of falling London bombs, from which the infant baker was sheltered while his father was away at a war from which he did not return, over Baker's buckshot snare work, is striking.

For all his troubling personal behaviour, Ginger Baker remains the purist's choice: when presented with a comparison, Eric Clapton is surprisingly blunt in his dismissal of Baker's contemporaries John Bonham and Keith Moon.

As with all rock biographies, there are portions of Baker's story which are less inherently interesting than others, and here this presents in a somewhat flatter middle section where we learn about Baker's developing passion for, of all things, polo, in the pursuit of which the drummer has seemingly exported horses across three continents. Despite having fathered a number of children and even in his advancing years Ginger Baker is not the reconciling type, so the picture lacks a grand warm reunion conclusion but the picture we're left with, of a profoundly gifted, troubled, self-destructive and man, is never less than engaging.

There is a clever use of archive material.

eccentric personality and it is probably for the best that I have never met him (I would be crushed if I caught him on a bad day and he dissed me). Never the less I have most all of his recorded works, solo and with various groups on vinyl and CD. Let me say also that I provided rare photos and video from my collection which were used in this film. The finished project far exceeded my expectations. The film presents the man's life and career very frankly. Nothing is held back. The good and the bad. There are scenes that will make you laugh and some that will make you sad at some of the down turns in Baker's life.
The interviews are well done and the various commenters are candid in their views. Eric Clapton presents a very strong view when the interviewer tries to compare Baker to Keith Moon and John Bonham. With a wave of his hand Eric dismisses that thought saying there WAS no comparison because Ginger is a complete musician who could write and arrange as well as play on a world class level. Let's not forget the performance clips. Film clips from many of Baker's musical ventures are included from Graham Bond to Cream, Blind Faith, Air Force
as well as drum battles with other famous drummers.
This is one of the better Rock documentaries that have been made to date and it is good that it has happened while Ginger is here to see the finished project. The only thing that would have made the DVD better would have to  included some of the performance clips in their entirety as bonus features.
 One out take which the film maker sent me which was NOT used in the film had him asking Ginger if he was surprised that he was still alive after the life he has led. His response, ""Amazed frankly. For all of my past wickedness, God is keeping me alive and in as much pain as he possibly can.""

5578728,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"I am a fan of Baker's drumming, and I purchased this video although I haven't viewed it yet.
I did notice that on the jacket it is claimed that Ginger Baker is the originator of the drum solo.
As if neither Chick Webb, Gene Krupa, nor Buddy Rich hadn't already become famous for their drum soloing before Mr. Baker ever touched a drum stick.
So this may be a great documentary about a terrific drummer. But originator of the drum solo?  That is an insult to those on whose shoulders he stood.
I will rate it as a 5 in order not to affect the existing rating of 4.6.
ADDENDUM: After having viewed this video twice, I can strongly recommend it. I plan to watch it again soon. Jay Bulger made it really interesting (and got a broken nose from GB for his efforts). Baker comes off as a man with a chip on his shoulder, possibly stemming from the loss of his father. He seems quick to anger, and prone to use violence when angry. He once threatened Jack Bruce with a knife, because Bruce DARED to play his bass while Baker was soloing. He also seems to be a burner of bridges, having quit almost every group he formed and he is now on his fourth wife (or is it fifth?).
Then again, Baker made an obsession out of his instrument and took it to a level few others have attained. None of his quirks change that fact. But it seems a shame that he could not have produced more music with the Denver Jazz Quartet 2 Octet. His one CD with them (Coward of The County) is simply outstanding! Baker walked out on this group after only one album. I think that GB would have been much more prolific if he had had better control of his anger and was a bit more pleasent towards his bandmates. Oh, well.
I was relieved to see that the 'inventer of the drum solo' comment was made by an overenthusiastic reviewer, not by Baker himself.

This well-done documentary depicts a brilliant jazz drummer who actually created Cream, as well as other amazing bands, but whose lack of people skills, heroin and, well, crazy genius made him the least loved drummer in the world of musicians. After watching this documentary, twice, and giving a copy to my drummer uncle, I have since listened to 4 Ginger Baker cds, all from later bands he created, and all amazing!

5578731,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Ginger Baker is the greatest Rock drummer ever, and the greatest living Jazz drummer.  Don't waste my time or yours with debate.  There is none. This is his story.  He is still hard to deal with, and his devotion to Polo is a bit odd. He has been part of (as well as founded) some of the most respected and talented bands ever formed.  Imagine ""White Room"" with a different arrangement or some other drummer.  Nope.

That said, don't expect an aging ""Old Professor"" type rocker.  He's testy, cranky, and brilliant. His travels the world over, leaving shaking fists in his wake, are fascinating.  The segments on his time in Africa are absorbing, and darn good fun in parts. Some of the top drummers in the world are present here, talking about his influence and artistry.  One of my favorite parts is the way Baker and Clapton talk about John Bonham and Keith Moon.  Priceless.

However when Cream came out for some reason I focused more on the guitar player, and bass player than the drummer. Not that Ginger was bad, just a confusion of jazz and rock strokes. Never quite locking in on a style, just accompanying two very accomplished musicians.
After awhile Ginger almost became more of a character than consummate musician. His ability to insult, abuse, and confront others made more front page news than his playing.
He refuses to credit Bonham, Moon, or other contemporaries on their talent.

In this video you are entertained by his continued attitude, and ornery nature.
He is living a result of his choices. He could have had a blessed life, and retired a rich, respected musician.
Instead this video shows why he lives a bitter old man, mad at the world.

5578735,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"Beware Of Mr Baker is a film that tells the story of Ginger Baker warts and all with a few exceptions where Ginger clearly did not want told in the film. I can imagine he was not an easy man to interview and at the time of the film making Ginger was clearly not a happy man as he was about to lose his horses and home.
Ginger made some terrible mistakes in his life and has trouble discussing these or simply does not discuss them. I like the honesty and the interviews with his family and friends, that is what makes this film so interesting as does the magnificent video footage of Baker in action with Cream, his other musical projects and one session that I found mesmerising was the playing he did in Africa in the early 1970s, that clearly was some of his most exciting musical work and its a shame he did not put more into this and create a whole new chapter in his career.
Ginger Baker seems to be a very angry and difficult man to deal with but at times you can see he is also a bit of a softy when he wants to be.
I was hoping personally for some complete footage of some of his best music and some discussion about his time with Hawkwind and BBM that does not get a mention apart from the cover of BBM.
The DVD I am reviewing is the USA version. This DVD does not contain any extra footage or anything else and does not have subtitles which I found annoying as I had trouble hearing Gingers voice at times.",1376006400,,1417,4.11913357400722

He's made some great music with some equally great musicians but has also paid his dues on numerous occasions and with varying results. This film sheds light on the good and bad sides of Ginger, includes some rare and amazing footage of him and his contemporaries and tells his story very bluntly. This is not a glossed over compliment filled bio but a stark, real and sometimes difficult look at this legendary musician.

5578747,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Beware of Mr. Baker is about being an artist and being a jerk.  Ginger Baker is more the latter than the former. The doc starts at the end of producer/director Jay Bulger's interview time with Ginger. Ginger goes nuts and busts Jay's nose with a metal cane once he hears that Jay will now talk to other people so that he might get a more rounded picture of his subject. The look in Ginger's eyes, which is captured in a freeze frame from behind his tinted glasses, is demonic. Cue the famous Cream riff-three major power chords going down, down, down...and the film never lets you go. It's a bit of a rubbernecking nightmare to view Ginger's life in the way that Bulger has framed it...a lot of Schadenfreude going on here. Onr gets the the uncomfortable feeling that Ginger's haloed jazz heroes like Max Roach, Elvin Jones, and Art Blakey paid lip service to Ginger's chops, but no matter. All Ginger ever wanted to be was black. When Roach told him that he played like an n-word, tears poured from his face. This is Mr. Baker the misunderstood jazz cat. Then there's Mr. Baker the Rock God-that lasted for oh so short a period of time, but was oh so sweet, with the Graham Bond Organization, Cream, and Blind Faith. Bulger captures the spirit of Ginger in the 60s with fantastic inserts of vintage Ginger, vintage Cream, etc. Ginger post-Blind Faith is pretty much all down hill and Bulger captures it with a Schadenfreude-like glee, inserting all the little nasties that everybody had to say about Ginger, because Ginger is a jerk, but always lauding his genius at the kit. He left Nigeria in the Seventies because that's what Ginger does. He sets up, then leaves a wake of destruction upon his departure. In Nigeria he befriended the great musician turned politician Fela Kuti. Ginger grooved in Lagos till he was pink in the face. Then he got a yen for polo which only the ruling elite played. By playing polo, Ginger alienated Fela, but he refused to give up (in fact, it seems that he spent all of his 5 million from the Cream reunion in 2005 on polo ponies). So, after Lagos, Ginger lands in LA to make movies, then he lands in Denver, lands in South Africa, all the while being an absolute jerk to his kids, and to nearly everyone around him. Ginger makes a very unfriendly objet d'art. But the movie is so damned watchable, mainly, I think, because Ginger is a nut, and as Johnny Lydon says, if his nuttiness was what was required to produce the perfection that was Ginger's drumming, then it's worth it. I would ask Mr. Rotten to explain this to Ginger's emotionally abused son. (And I would also point to the many sane drummers out there who are just as good if not better than Ginger, and tell them Lydon's thoughts on the twin burdens of being a horrible person and a great artist.)

5578753,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Ginger Baker remains the greatest rock drummer ever, as well as being one of the greatest jazz drummers of all time.  He totally revolutionized the concept of a drummer in rock band, jumping from what had traditionally been only a backing role to an integral part of the sound of the band -- just listen to his African inspired rhythms on ""Sunshine of Your Love"" or his progressively dramatic mallet work on ""We're Going Wrong"" to get the picture.  He brought the concept of the drum solo to the popular music front in a way that nobody had since Gene Krupa, and his use of a double kit (especially his syncopated used of a double bass drum to create what sounded like cannons going off for a head of state)was extraordinary and was not just for show.  This documentary carefully points out the tremendous influence he had on other drummers  of his generation, including Neal Peart, Stewart Copeland, and Bill Ward, all of whom have something to say about him.  Per the other reviews, you come away both admiring and disliking him as a human being: he has gone through four wives (three of whom are interviewed),was a less than stellar father (his son Kofi Baker is a great drummer as well), he is difficult to work with on a professional level, and he has gone through several fortunes in his life due to a penchant for polo ponies (they don't call it the ""sport of kings"" for nothing, you have to be as rich as a king to maintain a polo stable) and for chasing the dragon.  However, he is a survivor through it all, and his mastery as a drummer, especially when clips are shown from his glory years in the sixties and seventies, is awesome to behold.  The documentary covers most of the highs and lows of his career, including Cream, Blind Faith, Ginger Baker's Airforce, his years in Nigeria exploring African music, drum-offs with jazz drumming masters like Max Roach, the Baker Gurvitz Army (great footage of him being so stoned he can't even sit on his drum seat), Masters of Reality (the best and only album this outfit ever did with Baker was Sunrise on The Sufferbus, and if you have never heard it you are doing yourself a great disservice until you do, as Baker's drumming is the highlight of the album), and the Ginger Baker Trio (I believe this group's first album got a Grammy, and Baker's hi-hat work in this outing is unbelievably good).  Some of his musical outings and ventures have been done simply for the money, as his lavish polo pony lifestyle has been difficult to maintain -- for example, the film doesn't even mention his stint with the British space-rock band Hawkwind, a gig that I read elsewhere that he took solely for the dough.  Cream's Royal Albert Hall reunion circa 2005 was supposedly agreed to by Clapton to refill Ginger's coffers -- per Kofi's comments in the documentary, this money went out the door as soon as it came into his hands.  Whether you are a Ginger Baker or Cream fan or not, this is a great film about an important musician and is highly entertaining and enlightening.  Having seen Ginger live three times (twice with Cream and once when he was with the Jack Bruce Band), he is a force of nature to be reckoned with when he sits behind a kit.  I wish him the best in the twilight of his years.",1374192000,2,3247,4.522184300341297
5578754,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"A great movie on the legendary drummer.  This movie explains who he is musically to the eccentric side of his life.  I enjoyed it completely.  This is a ""must see"" if you're a drummer or if you appreciate legendary musicians.",1374192000,,225,4.575
5578755,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"Who would have guessed that Ginger Baker lived such an outrageous life?  Well I suppose Cream fans were already fully aware of it and were probably licking their chops for a documentary such as this to be made, but I'm in between how much of a Cream fan I really am (I enjoy their material, love several of their live performances including Live Cream Volume 2 and Wheels of Fire, but I'm probably only a minor fan at best).  For whatever reason, over the years Cream's wildness on stage has been sort of pushed to the back so rock bands such as the Who, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath get more of the attention these days.  It's a shame- Ginger Baker is truly a unique individual!

I actually question if some of this stuff we see in this documentary is exaggerated or fabricated for the purpose of making Ginger's life seem more interesting which translates into a more compelling story for the viewers.  Not that I'm saying his life was boring by any means- far from it.  This is the first time I've ever actually seen him speak so I really don't know the answer to that one.  And WOW!  He's NOTHING like I ever would have guessed!  He's an incredibly bitter and stubborn old man who cusses and mumbles like an Ozzy Osbourne sailor that sits around smoking while his fading health deteriorates even more.  While doing the interview I couldn't help but think ""Man Ginger, put those cigarettes down!"" and to make matters worse, he needs a breathing mask by the end.  *groans*.

Anyway, regardless how truthful or believable this documentary really is, Ginger Baker has established himself as an outrageous and influential drummer that most rock and roll fans (and perhaps jazz fans) should most certainly appreciate.  This is 100% true.  A good chunk of the stories we hear in this documentary involve Ginger mentioning his drumming influences which includes several legendary jazz musicians, and another constant part of this documentary is that Ginger mentions how the African drumming rhythms played quite an important role in how he ultimately developed his own style (to the point that he even took a trip to Africa for a while back in the 70's, a piece of information I did not know beforehand).  Also mentioned is Ginger's father who was serving in World War II when he was killed.  I didn't know this either, or that Ginger had to join gangs to survive as a teenager.

The always humble and honest Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce are mentioned occasionally and even take part in their own short interview clips and personal feelings towards Ginger's crazy behavior and talent concerning the years Cream were together but, believe it or not, these segments are not as lengthy or as detailed as one would expect.  The Blind Faith period was barely mentioned at all.  Eric Clapton basically recognizes that Ginger is Ginger- the way he acts is just the way he is, and the two consider each other friends which is amazing considering how incredibly *different* both of their personalities are.  We meet Ginger's family, and the African children he adopted (I think).  It would seem he doesn't get along with his family at all, haha.  Another huge focus is on Ginger's horses- he lives on a horse farm and appreciates animals more than people apparently.  As one would expect however- we see a LOT of footage showing how extremely talented Ginger is behind that drum kit, most of which is footage recorded during the 60's and 70's.

Overall, a pretty amazing documentary.  Also, some rather amazing art work and animation portraying several situations of Ginger's life enhances the storytelling.  We hear personal stories by several musicians that were influenced or played with Ginger at one point, and for those of us who had no experience with Ginger's personality before going into this documentary, well, we sure get the surprise of our lives don't we?!?!  Even though Ginger recognizes he has talent, he desires to not compare himself to other rock and roll drummers.  I guess his dislike of heavy metal and how he believes the genre being born was a mistake explains it.  I can't help but feel the ending was totally fixed- Ginger does something violent (I won't spoil it) and it just seems like he's doing it for the sake of getting a reaction.  They briefly mention his short stint as a Hollywood actor so that may explain this segment.  Who knows really.  Highly recommended for rock enthusiasts.",1374105600,2,4406,4.771767810026385

5578774,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"A riveting, compelling and often hysterical documentary about Mr. Baker, the most singularly inventive rock drummer of the modern era, and a monstrous menace to many of the musicians he's performed with. What made him different than his contemporaries like Moon, Bonham and Mitch Mitchell was his rooted understanding of jazz and African time signatures, which he employed with ferocity, fusing these rhythms with the rock, funk and blues that made him an entity unto himself. Oh yeah, that and his equally mythic drug use which makes the oft-cited tales of Keith Richards appear tame by comparison. You see, the Brits had a different view of heroin users back in the 60's - as long as you were a registered addict, which was seen as an illness, you got drugs from the social services unit, and if stopped by the cops with drugs while on the road, you just produced your permit card and off you went. No jail, arrests, court dates or prison time. But this I learned from reading Jack Bruce's excellent bio, ""Composing Himself"", by Harry Shapiro, which is mandatory reading for fans as well.

What's very original here is the way certain pivotal pieces of Ginger's past are recreated through the use of wildly drawn animation sequences instead of  a boring series of aged and faded pictures (though there are some of those as well), which keeps the action moving through potentially dull moments, of which there are few. Then, as now, Ginger was cantankerous, aggressive, abusive, confrontational and combative, as likely to throw a punch as a paradiddle on stage. Which is why we love him (well, most of us, anyway). So we hear stories of his bouts with other musicians intercut with current footage of him cursing, condemning and caning his interviewer and director Jay Bulger, who deserves a humanitarian award for willfully submitting to be a POW under house arrest in Baker's compound in order to produce this superb film.

As much as Baker despises people, his love for dogs and horses is also legendary, and he has always surrounded himself with them in lieu of any real bonding with bipeds, whether it be fellow musicians, wives (of which he has had 4) or children, so it mitigates some of his more despicable tendencies, though not necessarily all. But he has always professed that if it came down to relationships with people or his drumming, it would always be the latter, so he has always remained true to himself and can't be called a liar or failure in this regard. I'm not sayin' it's right, I'm just sayin'... He's consistently done what he wanted, when he wanted, blindly in fact, which accounts for all the bad business decisions he's made throughout his career and personal life (this I learned from reading his own biography).

As thorough as this document presumably is, covering the most publicly known aspects of his career (GBO, Cream, Blind Faith, Fela Kuti, Airforce, Baker-Gurvitz Army), there are several huge and inexcusable gaps left untouched here that left me pissed off; namely his many albums and tours with Bill Laswell, Material, Last Exit, No Material, Jonas Hellborg, Energy and African Force, all from the 80's when he was invisible to the public. After all, Laswell was the one who went to Italy to bring him out of hibernation to do the PIL album w/ John Lydon which began his reemergence as a player. And then there's his tremendous solo albums ""Horses and Trees"" and ""Middle Passage"", both produced by Laswell, as well as the Grammy-winning Ginger Baker Trio ""Going Back Home"" and its follow-up, ""Falling off the Roof"", both with Bill Frisell and Charlie Haden - how do you NOT mention these endeavors, when they are the most significant in his post Cream career??? It's absolutely criminal, so someone wasn't doing their research homework, but I still loved this tribute to the world's most polyrhythmic pugilist and irascible, grumpy, menacing and spidery skinbasher that ever (dis)graced the drum throne. As a drummer growing up, he was a mysterious lightning-rod for inspiration and a rebellious superhero for those who lived dangerously. That's my Baker - Beware indeed...",1372550400,3,4119,4.913793103448276
5578775,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"If you're a devout follower of rock history, you've been aware for some time, that Ginger Baker, arguably one of the greatest drummers of all time, is a mean, curmudgeonly ole geezer.  You know that he despised Jack Bruce, and pretty much everyone.  Despite providing crushing beats for some of the best moments in Rock, he will all but cut you, if you call him a rock drummer.  He's a jazz drummer, make nooooo mistake about it.

But for those who might only know about Ginger Baker the artist, this is going to be quite a reveal.

Ginger Baker might be the angriest, meanest man in rock, with no patience for anyone, and a complete disregard of people.  He has no love for anyone or anything that isn't related to jazz, horses or dogs.  He is cruel, violent, temperamental, and insane.  He is also arguably one of, if not THE greatest drummer, to ever play.

Abandoned by his father during wartime, bullied at school, Baker finds refuge in the drums, is introduced to jazz (and heroin), and African Drumming and finds his calling to the alienation of all around him.  Throughout his rise to fame with The Graham Bond Organization (where he first works with Jack Bruce, and almost kicks and stabs him to death during a gig), the supergroup Cream, Blind Faith (where he shows up, unwanted), Airforce and then his expeditions into Africa where he worked with the legendary Fela Kuti, and then winds up even being on opposite sides of him.  He alienates and makes enemies wherever he goes.  That he finds women to want to be with him despite his horrific personality, is nothing short of amazing.  He has children all of whom he abandons, in particular his son, also a drummer.

Indeed, the one time Baker shows emotion, is when he gets to tell the cameras that his heroes, Max Roach, Art Blakey and Elvin Jones all became dear friends of his, and considered him, ""one of them.""  Then he cries.  Amazing.

When the interviews in his home in South Africa are conducted, he's about ready to give it all up, a result of money mismanagement and overspending.  He has a new family, all African, and they are for the most part, highly suspicious of him, even his new wife.  He requires oxygen, but he chain smokes.  You can almost see, how it's his insidious nature, his demonic persona that has aged him far beyond a life spent in one of the greatest rock bands of all time.

The interview concludes where he breaks his interviewers nose, all because he wants to get others on tape, none of whom Baker wants on the film.

So why watch?  Because despite the fact that Baker is a prick, he's also one of the most incredible musicians you'll ever hear, and the chronology of his musical history is far greater than his almost comical bad behavior.  It's incredibly well done, and has fabulous commentaries from everyone from Neil Peart to Stewart Copeland.  A MUST watch.",1372550400,8,2861,4.595660749506903

His long suffering family members have legitimate beefs with him, but I feel the film gives a snap shot not an overview",1371168000,4,430,4.417721518987341
5578796,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"Those of you familiar with the legends surrounding Mr. Baker already have some inkling about what is in here. The key to Ginger Baker, IMHO, is that he is a jazz musician and NOT a pop artist. His personality is based on his tough working class background and his early discovery of his life-long love - jazz drumming.  His journey to Africa alone places him among the few true musical disciples who actually travelled to the ends of the earth in search of their muse. I was personally intrigued by the content focusing on his influences, Phil Seamen, Art Blakey and Max Roach. The most emotional part of the film was Ginger's proud statement that he became close friends with those players he most admired and considered mentors. Being accepted within that fraternity and his journey there SHOULD have been the focus of a documentary on such a huge figure.

However, that was not to be. Instead, we were treated to a cartoonesque (in reality as well as in style) character study - which unfortunately, is probably all too true. The man is a tough hombre, takes no prisoners and is, himself, prisoner to demons conjured up early in life. Drug abuse, psychological abuse of those close to him and, also physical abuse. It was actually hilarious until one realized that, here is a truely tragic figure. I feel for Mr. Baker, his family and those around him who were hurt by his self-destructive and emotional personality.

The producer of the film left a lot to be desired. Attempting to get Ginger Baker to cry on screen was one of the most disgusting scenes I ever saw. In my humble opinion, Mr. Baker was right to pull out his cane in that instance.

I admire Ginger Baker for all he has accomplished musically. As for his personal life, my heart goes out to him and those affected around him. Like most giants of the arts, he has charged positive and negative sides. The man is who he is: pleasantly not politically correct, a huge talent and a volatile personality. Overall this is an engrossing video.

Two final thoughts: 1. I was pleased Cream was not the entire focus of the program (it forming only 2 years of a 50 year plus career) and 2. where the heck can one obtain a copy of that B movie Ginger starred in where he is doing a Rambo with a machine gun?? LOL!!

Postscript: I finally saw Cream at MSG in 2005 and sat just behind Ginger Baker. It was one of the most thrilling concerts of my life. Thank you for your music and talent, Mr. Baker.",1371081600,2,2455,4.50561797752809

5578808,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"As soon as I heard this movie was being made some 2 years ago, I anticipated its release, however I never did expect such a well done piece of film on Ginger Baker.

Having been a fan for almost 50 years, I was not expecting to be entertained with any new information.  We all know the feud with Jack, the drug addition, the failed businesses,marriages, deportation, African years (with Kuti & his recording studio), etc. However, I got something I did not expect ""a wonderful entertaining and honest documentary.""

I took my family with me (my children now in their 30s) to see the movie.  We found ourselves, intrigued, laughing, crying and never bored, never.....  Although at times the film is painful to watch, it's always honest.  Ginger is straight forward, emotional, candid, always honest and sometimes very very funny.

The music clips are great, some interesting rare footage with Air Force, Baker/Gurvitz Army,Kuti, however what is unique is how Mr. Bulger put in the animated sections, it is masterful, well done and adds a good flow to the movie.

 I could go on for pages and pages, however what truly makes this movie work is the fact the Jay Bulger knew very little about Ginger's illustrious career, as such - he asked questions from an ignorant standpoint (some questions that  were not  asked of Ginger for some 40 years), he was not aware of what would light Ginger's flame, so he asked it all.... This approach made the movie a success, as Jay did not hold back.... but did so without knowing he was pushing Ginger's buttons- He Made His Lack Of Knowledge Work As His Assett.  An expert historian's  approach would have made another boring movie. Ginger gives some in depth detail on some of his favorite drummers such as  Max Roach, Phil Seamen, Art Blakey, plus gives a clear and concise history of the pre Cream years.

Lastly, the best place to see this movie would be in the theatre, however if this cannot be experienced, I strongly suggest getting the DVD and not downloading, as the downloaded version does not stream well.  5 big stars to Ginger and Jay...  a true Masterpiece, Entertaining and  Honest Movie.......What Jay Bulger achieved with his directing film debut, is what most other independent film makers never achieve - .

5578812,2,B00BCMT0AQ,"This is a classic example of a filmmaker undermining his subject by working too hard to sell the film.  As someone who is interested in the subject I feel cheated. If this were a political essay ala Michael Moore I would understand the relentless tone. If you assume that most people are watching due to their interest in Ginger Baker, inserting the director's viewpoint into a biographical sketch is a questionable choice as it distracts from Ginger and his playing by choosing instead to focus on the ""danger"" of interviewing a difficult subject.

It starts by showing the director getting hit by Mr. Baker and then segues back to the beginning with our young, ambitious and evidently morally compromised director filming himself lying to Mr. Baker to get an interview. In the end, outside of Mr. Baker's own stories and the clips of him performing I didn't trust any of the information as it was shown.  Even Eric Clapton's interview did very little to shed light on the subject.  And I have to roll my eyes on the inclusion of second hand accounts of ""what Clapton must have felt"" when Ginger showed up to play with Blind Faith. When you are interviewing Clapton himself it seems incredibly lame to give weight to somebody else's interpretation of the same event.

Seemingly made for the ADD crowd there is relentless animation and drumming though out the film to underscore the story as it's presented.  Additionally there are sequences where the filmmaker presents himself as a gadfly intentionally provoking his subject and then presenting the results as proof of Mr. Baker as a ""wild man."" It conjures up the image of a young boy poking at a sick animal with a stick, both fascinated and afraid of the reaction. Especially grating is the ""you can't give up"" shtick the director blathers towards Ginger at the end of the film.  If the director wanted to make Ginger look better by comparison, including himself in the film was a good choice.

Additionally I found it strange that the information presented in the film was incomplete.  Critical information in the original article for Rolling Stone, written by the director of the film, was left out.  Even the promotional interviews contained relevant information not covered in the film.

One has to wonder if the filmmaker is really that callous or if it's just desperation that makes him so obnoxious.  In either case he presents himself as someone who is so patronizing and craven that the real story seems to be how desperate Mr. Baker must be to allow this kind of intrusion into his life. I'm not a particularly violent person, but after thinking about this film for a few days I found myself wishing Mr. Baker had beaten the daylights out the director instead of just breaking his nose. Let me note here that I don't really wish the director any harm and I am not happy with having to endure that kind of anger just to glean a few insights into Mr. Baker.

In the end I am happy that I got a chance to hear Ginger interviewed and see the related clips of him playing.  I wish I had not been exposed to this style of filmmaking, especially the bullying, but I'm hoping that it's just clumsiness. Perhaps next time the director will make the truly brave choice of simply showing his subject rather than worrying that his subject is boring and choosing to hype a simplistic viewpoint instead.",1369180800,14,3354,4.711111111111111
5578813,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"Yes, Baker is brilliant, and so is this film.  the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the filmmaker didn't bother to interview jazz drummers about Baker's influence and innovations.  That is unfortunately.  as much as the film spotlights Baker's genius and trainwreck comnpulsivity, the filmmaker is too fixated on highlighting Ginger as the world's greatest rock drummer-- a distinction the artist himself despises.

However, I appreciate those moments in which Baker sets the filmmaker straight, either through condescending remarks or by breaking Jay's nose.  All the while, Baker sprinkles in a liberal dose of his opinion of other musicians (notably, some choice words about Bonham and Moon that are bound to offend many a classic rock fan...although I am somewhat in agreement where the latter is concerned).

this is an excellent study in rock iconography.  What is lacking is a truly critical assessment of Baker's innovations and contribution to drumming as a whole.  The film overemphasizes his forays into Africa and African drumming (no, he wasn't the first...his idols all studied it extensively and the American jazz drummers-- Blakey, Roach, Elvin Jones--  whom he sought to emulate went to Africa to study long before Baker thought about it) and not enough on his technical innovations (he really pioneered double-bass drum techniques, whereas the handful of earlier drummers with double-bass kits boasted of such excesses mainly for looks), and he also engineered Forerunners of certain drumming equipment staples, such as cymbal stackers, and even crafted his own acrylic kit in the early 69s.  Likewise, he and fellow jazz drummer Mitch Mitchell were instrumental in shifting rock music out of 4/4 time and into unusual time signatures.

But perhaps the intimate view into the life and personality of this character explains why we don't acknowledge Baker as openly as we might as one of the most significant innovators of modern drumming as we know it.  Perhaps this film will, as Johnny rotten suggests, inspire us to ""love and appreciate this character, no matter how awkward he seems.""",1369094400,6,2124,5.233038348082596

Life with such a person is horrible. This documentary does a pretty good job of showing that.

I saw this on the 'big screen' at Cleveland Institute of Art.  I rarely go to the standard Hollywood fare of movies anymore but when I heard about this I rushed to buy a ticket.

I rarely would purchase an album because of the drummer - Ginger was the exception.  Having read the biographies of Eric, Jack, and Ginger, and the story of Cream, I still learned so much from the film, many things that Ginger left out of his biography.  The film is not only fascinating but extremely well done.  One of the producers grew up in Cleveland and answered questions after the film.  It took 4 years to make this documentary so it was an incredible labor of love.

Ginger has made the point before that he did not get the royalties he deserved and he is probably right.  (Mostly blames Jack for this if you read his biography.)  But after seeing this documentary, you realize that he likely would have blown any additional monies anyway.

Highly recommended film.",1363392000,23,1072,4.613756613756614
5578832,4,B00BCMT0AQ,"A pretty comprehensive look at Ginger Baker. He isn't the easiest subject to interview and you can see his obvious issues dealing with people. The producer lets Baker do the damage himself, which he willingly does. He holds no punches, doesn't think before speaking at all, he lets it fly with whatever he thinks. A followup would be nice, Baker has lost his ranch now and is back on the road to make money, having squandered multiple fortunes in his lifetime.",1363219200,2,460,4.691358024691358
5578833,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"For all of you who grew up listening to and modeling your playing after Ginger Baker,this is must see. Although it was a rather sad depiction of the man who started it all, I was absolutely enthralled with this film. Like someone in the film stated, he was a magnificent player and a horrible human being (paraphrased).",1363046400,2,319,4.614035087719298
5578834,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"As a working drummer for the past 40-odd years I have long held Ginger Baker up as the fiercest, most fearless, and innovative of all the drummers who came out of the rock era. This film shows us Mr Baker as he truly is guts, warts, weapons, drugs and all, and it does so not only through extensive interviews with the man himself, but with his families, past and present, as well as musical colleagues such as Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton, and admirers such as Johnny Rotten, Stewart Copeland, and Neil Peart. The animated sequences that are used to illustrate some of Baker's reminisces are quite effective and rendered in dark, espressionistic tones that suit Baker's story-telling perfectly. And the archival footage of Baker in this pre- and post-Cream days is edited in coherently, so that we get a pretty good sense of this fascinating, complex, and difficult character. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Mr Baker, the history of rock & roll, or the dynamics of dealing with a hard-headed genius.",1363046400,12,1018,4.822857142857143
5578835,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"I've been waiting a long time for this documentary, but man, is it worth the wait.  I was thirteen years old when I bought Disraeli Gears in 1968, and it was then, and still remains one of my favorite albums of all time.  In those days, we knew little of the personal stories behind these rock icons.  They were mythologized in the pages of Rolling Stone and Creem and were rarely on television.  Now, forty-five years later, watching this terrific film, my youth comes flooding back in wonderful clarity.
  This film shows through archival footage, most which I have never seen, some of the greatest moments of Ginger Baker's outrageous and tumultuous life.  For him to still be alive after the life he has led has to be some type of divine, crazy miracle.  Larger than life, Ginger surely dominated any surrounding he was in.  A red-headed demon; a force of nature, and undoubtably, the greatest drummer who ever lived.
  Thoroughly enjoyable, exciting entertainment, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in our beloved rock history and it's characters.  I'm gonna watch this movie over and over and over.",1362787200,7,1127,4.842931937172775

I also was moved by the creativity of the animated montages. A fantastic storytelling device. This is one of the finest documentaries I've ever seen.",1520899200,,388,4.8059701492537314

8566223,5,B00BCMT0AQ,"Ginger is a legendary player/bandleader. Me and a friend had a chance to sit and talk with him and his bandmates after his jazz gig at the Iridium in NYC in '97. He was very nice, very open and honest. The band sounded great too.

I liked this movie, it's a well done biography. Talent only takes you so far. He's been reckless with his money, health, and relationships right up until the end. So it's ending as a sad story unfortunately. Regardless, I bought all the Cream albums and I bought the Cream Reunion 2005 dvd/cd and its great stuff. That 1966/67 period in England when Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience just took over the scene, it was like these guys dropped down from another planet, incredible stuff and it will never die.

I could strangle him for blowing his Cream reunion money though, seriously Ginger what were you thinking??? He had an obsession with polo ponies and he indulged, which is depicted in the movie. Those animals looked amazing, very beautiful....but you have to have Arab oil money to take care of 40 horses!!!!!",1485129600,,1051,4.614973262032086
