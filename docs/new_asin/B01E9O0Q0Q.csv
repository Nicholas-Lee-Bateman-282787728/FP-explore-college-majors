7733930,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"Just to clarify, this movie is not written or directed by Hayao Miyazaki, but by Studio Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata.  It's still a great film.  Takahata has some other great works under his belt, including GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, POM POKO, and THE TALE OF PRINCESS KAGUYA from 2013.  I just didn't want someone to be disappointed if they order this expecting a Miyazaki film.  Takahata is somewhat more grounded in reality than Miyazaki.  His movies remind me of the films of Yasujiro Ozu.",1463011200,47,493,4.821428571428571
7733931,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"I have seen Only Yesterday a number of times and I am always delighted with it.  It is a very early Miyazaki movie, with the emphasis on what draws us to the life we choose.  The story concerns a young woman living in Tokyo who does not really know herself and searches through her girlhood to understand how she became who she is.  She spends time on a farm and learns a way of life that is much more attuned to her real personality.  The animation is dated because the film is so old, but I saw it restored recently in a movie theater and it holds up well.  It is totally charming, very moving, and a lovely story that ends happily.  I heartily recommend it.  No spaceships.  No mechas.  No CGI.  No creatures from the sea.  Just a story of how and why we grow up and what we choose or should choose to become to be our true self.  It is sweet.  Buy it.",1460764800,36,855,4.078313253012048

7733935,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"This was a unique anime. I had never seen anything like it. For something that was made over 25 years ago, it felt absolutely current. The unique framing device of the past and the present and moving through them with ease was done brilliantly. The facial expressions of the characters were fantastic. The truth and honesty of their lives and emotions was clear for all to see.

A selfish little girl and her adult self mingle in each other's realities and we are able to see how certain events from the past impact present choices.

The blatantly honest discussion of a girl's first period is done so beautifully that I thought, ""What is America's hang up?"" Disney would not release the film unless Studio Ghibli cut the ""menstrual talk."" SG wisely said, ""Uh, I don't think so."" It's only because (some) people have grown up and realized how fantastic this film is that it has finally been released.

I watched in Japanese with English subtitles. I do not want to hear the English voices, even though I love the actors. Yes, there are universal truths in this story, but there are also very, very Japanese realities, and for anyone that spent any time in Japan in the '80s or '90s, or traveled to the countryside before the entire country became a giant rally for AKB48, you will be able to appreciate how authentic this is.

Two thumbs up, absolutely excellent. You MUST watch till the very last frame or you will be disappointed by what you will think is the ending. Keep going!",1527206400,3,1481,4.619771863117871
7733936,4,B01E9O0Q0Q,Very sweet and relateable story for any adult. I feel like kids might miss a lot of tiny details and ideas presented through the memory scenes but still enjoyable for all ages.,1526688000,,176,4.53125
7733937,4,B01E9O0Q0Q,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere, which makes this particular film all the more interesting, considering that even though it came out in 1991, it's the only Ghibli film to never be released in America with an English dub.....until now.

Taeko is a 27 year old woman, who's unmarried, has lived her whole life in Tokyo, and presently works at a company there. Wanting to get away from city life for a while, she decides to take a trip to visit the family of the elder brother of her brother-in-law in the rural countryside to help with the safflower harvest. But all throughout her trip, she begins to have flashbacks to herself as a schoolgirl in the fifth grade. Pretty soon, she's remembering all sorts of things from her past, like first crushes and the frustrations of puberty and growing up. And as the narrative shifts between the past and present, Taeko will begin to realize what she truly wants out of life.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Miyazaki film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible, and it makes scenes come alive in a very subtle way. The way that Taeko remembers her past is much like many of us do in real life, with flashbacks sometimes vivid enough that she can visualize her older self interacting with her younger self. Even the flashbacks are drawn and animated slightly differently, with scenes having a bit of a brighter, unfinished sort of haze over everything--the way our actual memories work when we try to think far back into our childhoods.

As for the plot, I can sort of understand why the film flew under the radar for so long, and why Disney was hesitant to dub it back when it was first released; mainly because this movie touches upon a genre not normally seen in animation---a realistic drama written for adults. As Taeko reflects on her past, some of her memories are more pleasant than others. Some are cute and funny, like her first crush, while others are more awkward, like when her classmates begin getting their first periods (and being bullied by the boys), and some are outright sad, like when she almost lands an important role in a play, but her father (for unknown reasons) refuses to let her perform.  It's a story that can really only be appreciated by an adult. As we reflect back on our childhoods, we see how we became the people we are today, and how some memories can be altered because of nostalgia glasses, or how some events can seem like a huge deal at the time, but aren't really important in the long run, or vice versa.

I once thought ""Whisper of the Heart"" was one of Ghibli's more realistic films, but this one has now taken that spot. Be warned that this film can be very slow moving at times, but a patient viewer will be rewarded with a lesson in how reflecting on your past can help you discover (or re-discover) what's truly important in life.",1526169600,,3152,4.591474245115453

7733945,4,B01E9O0Q0Q,"This is a film about growing up, hindsight, mistakes, and nostalgia from the director of Grave of the Fireflies. The art and animation are detailed and rich; also changing styles during flashbacks. This is probably why the film (which could have been made in live action) works as animation because you always remember the good old days, or your childhood, through a filter. It focuses on how your experiences, family, and friends mold you into your present self and how you'll continue to change in the future.

The one major drawback of the movie is that it is slow. I watched this with an older family member who left halfway though since ""nothing was happening"" as he put it. I don't imagine young children will have the patience. If you do watch this film with young children also be prepared to discuss puberty. That is the one subject that for years made this film ""undubbable"" since there is an unfortunate stereotype that animation is a cartoon therefore only meant for kids.",1519516800,3,984,4.754385964912281
7733946,4,B01E9O0Q0Q,"One of Studio Ghibli's less noted films from the early 90's, Only Yesterday was one not directed by Hayao Miyazaki, but Isao Takahata who is more known for Grave Of The Fireflies and The Tale Of Princess Kaguya. Only recently released in English through GKIDS, this slice-of-life feature unlike most Ghibli movies doesn't deal with otherworldly princesses or spirits meddling with the human world.

Taking place in the early 80s, mid-20's Taeko Okajima decides to spend her week off by leaving Tokyo and going to work on a farm with their recent harvest. During Taeko's journey to the country and while she works on the farm, she keeps flashbacking to her childhood growing up with her family, which apparently showed her dealing with being learning disabled which affected her growing as a person, also slightly stunting her maturity as she's still single. While on her visit Takeo also starts falling for local farmhand Toshio, and she keeps conflicting between her current self along with her childlike self from her memories.

Only Yesterday is one of those Ghibli productions that sort of slipped through the cracks by most American otaku as compared to most of Miyazaki's movies, but GKIDS did an above average release of this for English release. Having Daisy Ridley as the voice of Taeko was a good choice as far as popular actors is concerned, plus other VA regulars like Grey Griffin, Tara Strong, and Mona Marshall filling out the cast. Even non-Ghibli fans will find it charming and an animation miracle.",1519344000,,1516,4.964566929133858

Oddly touching, especially her decisions at the end.  Picture quality on the BD is very good as were the translated subs.",1517875200,,352,4.754098360655738
7733950,2,B01E9O0Q0Q,"I really, REALLY wanted to like this movie.  I am a die-hard Studio Ghibli fan and have/seen most of their work.  The art and animation is superb, as you'd expect from a Studio Ghibli film.  The voice-dubbing is decent.

The story is unfortunately very dull, awkward, and disjointed.  I understand the premise -- a woman in her late 20s will think back on her memories of when she was a fifth grader and how those moments have affected her as an adult.  I also have no problem with movies that can be slow, but only if there is a payoff in the plot.  But this movie trudges on at a snail's pace that never seems to really go anywhere, and then hits you with the credits just as soon as you think something interesting is finally going to happen.

The title of this movie should be ""How Everyone Crapped on Taeko"".  The girl was constantly let down at home.  School was a stressful mess for her where things just never seemed to go right for her -- whether it was with her grades or her friends.  She teeters on the brink of falling under ""The Woobie"" trope, and you can't help but continually feel sorry for her.

The father is the typical stoic stump that sits at the table and doesn't actively involve himself with the family unless it's to refuse something Taeko really wants, or to raise his hand to her.  The mother acts like she's dead inside half the time, and the sisters are superficial twits who take no consideration on how their words/behavior could hurt their little sister's feelings.

Honestly, if this wasn't a Studio Ghibli movie with all of the quality art you'd expect from their production, I would say it was terrible.  I wouldn't recommend this to children (or at least, not any I know).  And I really wouldn't recommend this to any other adult either, unless you really want to finish out your collection.

I'm glad to hear that others enjoy the movie, but for me, I didn't enjoy it at all.",1510876800,,1913,4.4511494252873565

7733952,4,B01E9O0Q0Q,Honestly for people who are in their late 20's and up I would highly reccomend this to. As I haven't experienced so much in life yet it didn't quite hit the nostalgia factor for me. I do plan to watch this again when Im a little older though!,1508803200,,242,4.0625

7733961,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"I won't give a review of the film because there are probably plenty of people who've examined and exposed the splendor of this film over the last 25 + years, So I'll comment on the distribution to America part of it.  It is great.
Disney got very self-congratulatory when they brought out Ghibli films; it becomes about THEIR behind the scenes efforts, THEIR big name voice actors, THEIR everything. I previously bought The Tale of The Princess Kaguya and loved how it was all about 1. JAPAN, 2. Isao Takahata, and 3. Everything that went into making that movie though I was kind of interested in what what America did to bring it here, and what James Caan, Mary Steenburgen Chole Grace and Darren Criss might have had to say...
This is a little more America than Japan behind the scenes coverage but it's still something of a balance. The American voice actors are fine but just like Kaguya, the one who's acting seemed flat and awkward was the title character, and that's a darn shame... Obviously this is because they're actors from live action film with no real experience in animation and you KNOW Daisy Ridley being here was a draw, but considering Studio Ghibli is hurting for money I can't blame them...?",1496448000,,1212,4.663551401869159

This movie is extremely underrated. A lot of people apparently have bad taste in films.

This is really a wonderful little gem. Really a beautiful story, poignant and touching, that scratches your heart smoothly while it develops and at the end you are in tears without noticing.

The final sequence with that heart piercing song that the English subtitle - although excellent - cannot really convey the highly poetic meaning of the lyrics, really brought me into tears. Not because it was sad, but because it was just so beautiful...

And yes, the English subtitles over Japanese audio is splendid.

""The river that drowns the tender reed is love:
a razor that bleeds your soul;
a hunger,an endless aching need,
a flower of emotions...

And you are only a seed:
a heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance,
a dream afraid of waking that never takes a chance,
the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give,
a soul afraid of dying that never learns to live.

When the night has been too lonely,
the road too long,
you'd think love is only for the lucky and strong.

(But) Beneath the bitter snow in winter lies the seed
that the sun's love in spring will make it into a beautiful blossoming...""",1480032000,3,1219,4.538812785388128
7734001,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"Just finished watching ""Only Yesterday"" released by Universal.
Based on the manga of same title, ""Only Yesterday"" was the only Studio Ghibli movie that never got an American DVD release until now - partly because it rather candidly approached the topic of when a young girl menstruates a rather bit to uncomfortably for most American audiences.
""Only Yesterday"" follows the journey of Taeko, a young woman who has decided to spend her two week vacation in the country to visit with her relatives and help them harvest flowers used in fabric dyes.
On the way, memories of her childhood, specifically from the time she was in the fifth grade, come flooding back to the forefront of her mind, and ""Only Yesterda"" seamlessly blends the present and past together as Taeko spins the tale of the most important year of her childhood to her relatives.  And as she tells the story of her life to her relatives and potential love interest Toshio - a former business executive who gave it all up for life in the country, Taeko finds herself wondering and even unwilling to break free from what she thinks are bittersweet memories.
While ""Only Yesterday"" does have the lush animation typically associated with all of Studio Ghibli's movies, it also does incorporate the spare animation style used in ""The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya.""
Highly Recommended!

7734028,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"""Omohide poro poro"" (which translates as ""memories of falling teardrops"" in English) or ""Only Yesterday"" as the west knows it, is a heartwarming coming of age film from studio ghibli, directed by Isao takahata who's best known for his heartbreaking anti-war film ""Grave of the fireflies"" which most critics hail as a masterpiece and his best work yet. I too shared the same opinion until I saw ""Only Yesterday"". It is one of the most realistic and deeply moving film I have ever seen.

""Only Yesterday"" tells the story of a 27 year old girl Taeko, who takes a 10 days vacation to safflower fields in Japan countryside. On her journey, she recalls the memories of her childhood when she lived with her parents and two elder sisters in a city. Film runs back and forth in time showing Taeko's rather painful past as a child and the woman she is today. The most heartwarming and winning moment in the film is the end where Taeko rediscovers herself and reaches a stage where she has to make a choice in life. This sequence is seen as the end credits roll past screen and is undoubtedly one of the finest scenes not just in an animated film but in any film, for that matter. It always gets me ;-)

Isao takahata's movies have always portrayed the harsh realities of life, be it ""grave of the fireflies"", ""my neighbors the yamadas"", ""pom poko"" or ""only yesterday"". With ""only yesterday"", Takahata succeeds in taking the audience where no other animator has gone before. ""Only yesterday"" is a slow paced film which runs in real time, doing justice to the plot and storyline. There are long conversations and quite a few slow moments in the film but they add to the beauty and realism of the subject without dragging the movie. There are moments where film talks about adulthood and few other mature themes from a child's point of view without being crude or vulgar. Anyone who thinks animation was always meant for kids will be blown away by ""only yesterday"". It is hard to describe in words the richness and emotional depth this movie has.

The animation of the film is detailed and looks absolutely realistic and flawless. It is impossible to erase from mind all those breathtakingly beautiful images of safflower fields wrapped in a blanket of morning mist, shown in the movie. The faded watercolor wash look in all the flashback shots is breathtaking and will haunt you long after the film is over.

""Only yesterday"" is a must have not just for any Ghibli-fan but for anyone looking for meaningful cinema, as well. Kudos to GKIDS for releasing this gem of a movie.",1470528000,4,2562,4.6490066225165565
7734029,2,B01E9O0Q0Q,"My wife and me got this movie thinking it would be a nice addition to set of Ghibli films. Both of us though were almost snoozing by the middle of it.

The characters did not really seem to fit together, it lacked the heart of many of the other story driven titles and did not pull me in. By the end of the movie I still did not care about anything that happened to the main character who seemed like a spoiled rich brat. Not quite sure if her family was rich or not. It seemed to fluctuate up and down. I do not want to say too much in case of possible spoilers, but this particular title is a good movie if I ever have trouble just falling asleep, though the side effects would be confusion with a little anger.

If you like very dry films with very little humor, not a lot of romance (yes it is a love story by the end of the film), characters that seem kind of forced, and a plot that does not really put all of this together well, then you might enjoy this film. I personally need some emotion other than I did not get this, or to do this and I wanted that and so I complain about it.

Anyway, I watched the Blu Ray and was blown away about how great it looked, and the dub was dead on and excellent.  For once I could really focus on the animation completely.  I saw new things.  I was really struck how one of the flashback scenes (The confession) was so starkly animated, nothing but pencil lines on white, leaving the focus on the characters.  Amazing.

7734040,3,B01E9O0Q0Q,"This is my fourth Isao Takahata directed movie, and I'm ever so slowly starting to figure him out:

Nobody creates more depressing movies.  For children.

The first Takahata movie I ever saw was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies/dp/B008XEZXRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies</a>, easily the most depressing movie ever made.  Basically, two Japanese children spend the final months of WWII starving to death.  Whoopee.  Now, there's been a little historical evidence removal, like the fact that Japan STARTED WWII and until the SECOND atomic bombing fought it in such a manner that the Nazis seem like good guys in comparison, but this isn't all that different from most Japanese films and shows set during this strange, memory altered period so I didn't think much of it.

The questions didn't start until I watched my second Takahata directed film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tale-of-the-Princess-Kaguya/dp/B00PHSDS0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</a>, his directorial swan song, and once again I was astonished by how depressing it was.  Mr. Takahata had taken an odd, traditional religious and elitist tale and made it worse by trying to tell it romantically.  By the time our two heroes have plunged to the depths of this emotional carnage, you will be wishing that all of the crew joined all of the characters in the worst possible place.  I truly began to wonder; were ALL of Takahata's movies this unwatchable?  Surely that couldn't include his quarter century old classic ""Only Yesterday"", right?  Well, no, as it turned out ""Only Yesterday"" wasn't that depressing....

It was just two hours of Nothing Happens.

27-year-old Tokyoite Taeko is something of a mystery.  She seems extraordinarily happy, but she's never married and she spends her vacations visiting with relatives joyously doing the hardest and most uninteresting fundamental tasks in the country.  Strangely this year she finds herself remembering in vivid detail the adventures of 11-year-old Taeko, and naturally viewers find themselves carefully examining said remembered adventures for clues.

Psst: There aren't any.

Not until the final remembered (and completely unrelated) adventure bursts into her mind and she repeats it to the love interest who responds with a partial explanation does anything click; in fact we see the entire ""Oh my God!  I'm in love with him!"" scenario play out silently, accompanied inexplicably by 11-year-old Taeko and all of the children, DURING THE END CREDITS!  (I haven't been this infuriated by the alleged sequel showing up as the credits roll since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steamboy/dp/B0009P42S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steamboy</a>!)

Meanwhile I have finally seen Takahata's directorial debut, the extraordinary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>.

7734041,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"In 1982, Taeko (Daisy Ridley) is a 27 year-old unmarried office worker from Tokyo who takes a two-week vacation to the country to work on a safflower farm and get away from the bustle of the city. During her trip, she is repeatedly reminded of memories of the year 1966 when she was a child and reflects on how her experiences during her youth have affected her as an adult.

Originally released in Japan in 1991, for twenty-five years this film was denied an official release in North America, much to the frustration of Studio Ghibli fans. The reason usually given (though unconfirmed) is that The Walt Disney Company, who handles most Ghibli releases in the United States, was uncomfortable with a particular scene that involved numerous mentions of menstruation. Regardless of the reason, GKIDS took up the task of finally giving this film the American release it deserves with a cast featuring Daisy Ridley as Taeko as an adult, Alison Fernandez as the child Taeko, and Dev Patel as Toshio. So the question is: Was it worth the wait?

To start off with, the animation in this film is excellent. Being as old as it is, it features classic, cel animation that is never made these days anymore. In fact, it might be said that the film uses two styles of animation. One being the present day that shows scenes in Tokyo and the countryside farm that Taeko visits. The attention to detail is exquisite and many scenes and backgrounds almost feel photographically realistic. The other style comes up during the flashback scenes to Taeko's childhood. Although it sticks to a realistic style, I found it interesting that some details were apparently omitted. Notably, most of the scenes have a faded, white edge as if we, the viewer, are just experiencing a memory that may not be perfect.

But the main draw of a movie like this is the story. The main message of the story is looking at one person and how her own experiences in the past shaped her as an adult. It also shows how the same experience can be viewed differently when first experienced as a child versus the hindsight from an adult perspective. As I am sure, most people probably have not always grown up to be the person they expected. The film also explores what it means to have unfulfilled expectations.

To a westerner, the film sometimes can be confusing to sit through. After all, it is a 1991 Japanese movie finally being released in America in 2016, but takes place in 1982 with numerous flashbacks to 1966. You can see how that might create some confusion. Perhaps the best example is the famous pineapple scene which I did not fully understand when viewing this film for the first time. There are some other Japanese cultural curiosities as well, but fortunately the Internet offers resources to understand these. Regardless, the overall message of the movie is something that is quite easily relatable to those of us in the west.

I thought that the dubbing of this film was quite good overall. Both Ridley and Fernandez shine as they bring to life Taeko for the English speaking audience. I thought it was an odd decision, however, to have Patel, with his British accent, voice Toshio which seemed a little out of place for his character. Curiously, Ridley suppressed her natural British accent for her role.

This Blu-ray set comes with a DVD copy of the movie, a making-of film that was filmed during Only Yesterday's production, interviews with the cast and crew of the English dub, and storyboards.

This was an enjoyable and thoughtful film. I would definitely recommend this to those that are fans of animation or Studio Ghibli. It has the type of mature story for a mature audience that is not often seen in western animation.",1469404800,,3706,4.736434108527132

It started out slow, but I retained hope and kept watching. I found myself wanting to fast forward this movie several times. In the second half I finally gave into the urge. The pacing is painfully slow, to the point where I wanted to just stop watching the movie.

Overall the story idea is cute, but there are too many ""stop and think about this"" montages, and some of the flashbacks don't fit well into the flow of the present day timeline.

Most Ghibli films end up on my ""watch more than once"" list. This one is on my ""I want my two hours back"" list. This despite the fact that the animation is beautiful, and the story cute.

7734048,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"This seems to be about how our past shapes us, and how our memories of it may reconnect us with dreams we thought we grew too old for. This character finds an opportunity to realize one of these dreams during a process of rediscovering her fifth grade self...but I won't spoil it any more on this point.

Let me just say that this was beautifully animated. Some of the scenes can be kind of plain but many (especially those with plants, trees, or nature in general) are incredibly lush and are gorgeous. The animation is wonderful. The subtle movements of the characters...and not just their personalities are very realistic. I really enjoyed seeing the time and consideration of all the subtle nuances in animation.

There is no major conflict to carry this story from beginning to end. There are some small conflicts in the nostalgic daydreams/reflections of the main character that create the reasons why these scenes might be important to the main character. These scenes are very lifelike...and I'm very impressed how realistic the characterizations are. Kids will play baseball or goof off in the classroom just like real kids do.

I was surprised to see the ""camera"" focus on a scene right when I thought it was ending. Maybe it's the young character sitting at the table and the camera lingers on her just sitting there. I began to wonder what was on this little girl's mind. Maybe it's a lengthy close-up of a flower in another scene. It sometimes moves slowly like a snail on a damp spring morning. And it does it so beautifully. Again...this kind of pacing might not be for everyone. For some, the scenes become interesting when we begin to wonder why the extra attention from the director in these lengthy shots? I think they are meaningful but with ambiguity that leaves us interpreting with our own memories of our own past. ""Yes...I remember being in that situation as a kid and i remember thinking...""

It's really engaging.

Things unfold slowly in this movie. If you're looking for big action or conflict then this might not be for you. This has the Takahata/Ghibli magic all over it. If you've enjoyed the pacing of some of his other films then give this a try. If you have an open mind and don't need major conflict or a lot of intensity in your movies then check this out.

Highly recommended for almost anyone patient who enjoys slice of life movies. I think most who know what they're getting into will be pleased with this film.",1468800000,3,2452,4.690697674418605
7734049,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"I felt compelled to write a positive review since there seems to be an abundance of reviewers who completely miss the quality of this film. Only Yesterday is Isao Takahata's second film for Studio Ghibli, coming off the heels of the notoriously grim and depressing Grave of the Fireflies, a masterpiece of film in its own right (but that's a review for another day). Takahata is known to be a master of creating a passionate emotional connection through his films, and Only Yesterday is no exception. It tackles themes we can all relate to, and which many of us have experienced in our own lives. Themes such as growing into adulthood, coming to terms with your past, recalling childhood nostalgia and falling in love. This is a slow, deliberately paced film, Apparently that's a major sticking point for quite a few people. I'm still baffled as to why reviewers constantly feel the need to point out that particular Ghibli films don't feature ""magical forest spirits and fantastical journeys."" At least half of the studio's entire catalog is comprised of down to earth slice-of-life films, so why do people constantly act so surprised when they come face to face with films like this one and From Up on Poppy Hill? Perhaps this is due to the stigma that animation must be an escape from our own reality, one that is mostly present in the western world (not so much in Japan clearly, as this was the highest grossing film of the year of its release over in its home country). While it is true that animation can achieve dreamlike imagery not possible in live action, it can also perfectly accentuate the minor details and human emotions and create a more whimsical version of our own world. And Only Yesterday encapsulates this idea perfectly, it also happens to be one of the best of this sub-sect of quieter, more reflective films in the studio's history. Anyway, enough plodding, let's get into the bulk of this review.

The story is extremely simple, a working class women in her late twenties decides to take a break from her monotonous salary-women lifestyle and visit the countryside for a week in hopes of connecting with not only the natural world, but herself as well. Along the way she recollects various memories of her childhood and its ups and downs while bonding with the members of the farming plantation and helping with the workload labor. The first thing to be praised is the characters, as they are all interesting and fun to watch in their own ways. Adult Taeko is very relatable in her mid life crisis and search for peace and content, and the many glimpses we get into her childhood self are able to make the mundane very charming and nostalgic. Young Taeko is just too cute to handle throughout, I might add. One of my favorite scenes from the film was her performance in her school play. The rest of the characters, while not as integral to the story, are also pleasant to watch. Especially Toshio, who acts as the love interest of the film. His insight into the fetishization of the country lifestyle is very profound, and you can see how it emotionally affects Taeko, as she was guilty of this herself.

Other aspects such as the animation and soundtrack are as impressive and well done as anything else Ghibli has done, as is to be expected. And yes, since this is a very realistic and down to earth film, there aren't really any wildly complex scenes that display the heights these animators are capable of reaching, but the real genuis is in the details, something that the Ghibli animators are revered for. Just little character movements and flourishes really add to the mood and feel of the film. Definitely the most notable and interesting aspect of the animation in Only Yesterday is the stark contrast of the busy and detailed modern day Japan and the watercolor drenched, hazy art of the scenes set in the main character's childhood. This created a very effective sense of nostalgia and memories that these scenes intend to evoke. This is something that Isao Takahata has a masterful grasp on. Like his latest (and possibly last) film, The Tale of The Princess Kaguya, the style and detail of the animation consistently changes with the mood and tone of each specific scene. For instance, when young Taeko is reeling from newly discovered affection from a classmate, she begins to float backwards in the air as she prances home in a dreamlike state of perpetual bliss. It's extremely charming and pleasant to watch, as is this film in its entirety.

The soundtrack of the film does its job effectively. It has a prominent Eastern European feel to it throughout, featuring some pretty interesting classical Romanian and Hungarian folk songs including one written by Gheorghe Zamfir. There's really not much else I can think of to say about it, aside from giving special mention to the lovely ending theme that plays over an extremely satisfying and charming final scene. The dub they've produced for this film is very serviceable, as is to be expected at this point from the guys at Ghibli Int. producing these. While it works as a faithful translation alternative for those who can't or don't want to read subtitles, I would recommend the original Japanese audio for this film in particular. Like most of Takahata's films, Only Yesterday is steeped in Japanese culture. So it just makes more sense to view it that way. Plus, Dev Patel's British accent in his rendition of the character of Toshio is more than just a little distracting. Daisy Ridley turned in a very convincing American accent, on the other hand. The rest of the supporting cast does a great job, no complaints there.

This blu-ray release isn't packed to the brim with features, but it does include full length storyboards and an interesting pan and scan documentary that was aired on Japanese television during the summer of the film's original theatrical release. It's actually pretty fascinating to see what the buzz around Ghibli and their films was like 25 years ago in a novelty sense (such as praising Nausicaa as the most groundbreaking and masterful Japanese animated film ever made (which could be argued is still the case). The presentation of the film itself is very sharp and clear. Again, no complaints here.

Only Yesterday is a highlight of not only Studio Ghibli's more calm and reflective films, but also in regard to their catalog of films in general. With it's nostalgic tone, magnificent sense of time and place, and powerful themes of finding yourself, Only Yesterday effectively draws the viewer in and and promotes inward inspection of one's own character as well. This is a film that grows in importance and impact with each consecutive viewing. It's an expertly crafted feel-good film that I constantly find myself coming back to and getting more out of it every time.",1468540800,4,6798,4.806837606837607

Our little heroine can be a bit of a brat and her reactions to family situations are ones all of us can relate to. Admit it! We ALL have a bit of a brat deep inside.

7734056,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"Only Yesterday, directed by Isao Takahata and originally released in 1991 in Japan, is a wonderful introspective poem of a film. I've seen every single Studio Ghibli film, from Nausicaa to Marnie, and Only Yesterday remains my favorite. Don't listen to the negative reviews, Isao Takahata has created a stunning and nostalgic experience that everyone should view. Casual Ghibli fans who aren't familiar with Takahata's work and are only used to Hayao Miyazaki's style may be repelled by the slow-moving slice of life nature of Only Yesterday. It's most effective for viewers in their mid-twenties and older, as they can easily relate to Taeko's feelings.

The plot of the film follows 27 year old Taeko, an office worker in Tokyo. She decides to take a vacation to visit her family in the country and pick safflowers on a rural farm. Along the way, her mind is flooded with memories of her ten year old self. Memories of first love, disappointment and childhood dreams begin to make Taeko question if she's really been true to herself. The film is distinctly set with two tones. Adult Taeko's scenes follow her on the farm and have gorgeous hand-painted backgrounds as usual for Ghibli. In these scenes, for the Japanese vocal track, the voices were recorded before the scenes were animated. This allows for a natural realness during conversations. When Taeko begins to reminisce, we switch to a flashback of her seventeen years prior. Child Taeko's scenes use softer colors yet are still equally beautiful despite utilizing areas of empty space, representing the nostalgic cloudiness that affects all our memories.

I highly recommend this film. I would go into an entire analysis on why each scene is perfection, but it's better for you to experience it firsthand. Isao Takahata's Only Yesterday is a reminder that our past shouldn't be an anchor, it can help us decipher who we are and realize what we really want out of the beauty of life.",1467849600,19,1943,4.938837920489297
7734057,1,B01E9O0Q0Q,"I've not seen this Bluray but I've seen this movie and it is a big waste of time that uses Miazaki's name to garner attention to it.  Mundane, simple, and very UN-extraordinary.  Easily could have been a mediocre live action film instead of a mediocre animated one.  Don't bother--nothing special and nothing magical",1467763200,2,316,4.9245283018867925
7734058,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"I pre-ordered this three months ago and finally got it today (: I was so excited for the release of this film in English. I knew Isao Takahata had did this film, along with Hayao Miyazaki as a producer. I was anxious to finally welcome another studio ghibli movie into my collection.

In the beginning of the movie, i was a little confused and some what bored. Because i wasn't understanding the little girl  scenes in the movie, it wasn't until like 5 minutes into the film I realized... Ohhhhhhhh it's her younger self... Lol.

 As I watched the movie I began to feel bored, but then there would be surprisingly sweet and innocent bursts of comedic dialogic from 5th grade Taeko, that made me giggle and chuckle to myself. Then I began to relate to how Taeko felt about her life, about how she remembered and reconnected with younger self. I mean who hasn't done this before? I quickly became engaged in this self re-discovery of Taeko, because.... I need a moment like what  Taeko experiences on the train going back to Tokyo. Don't we all? To realize what really makes us happy is the path we should not turn away from,because we have become ""safe"" in our lives. We never think to explore other avenues like our younger selves did. The ending of this movie was the highlight for me. I cried.... A LITTLE.... I swear!!!

Anyway,  it's to be expected from Isao Takahata. It's no exciting, magical, adventurous movie. So don't expect that when you watch this,and don't whine and complain that it wasn't what you expected, because that's why you read these reviews and a watch YouTube trailer.  This is a realistic film, that everyone can somewhat have a connection to, and realize that... A true mirror.... Is sometimes yourself. (:",1467676800,33,1733,4.659016393442623

7734060,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"While Only Yesterday (OY) is a fiction story its base is pure real life, and by real understand average or even mediocre, taboo topics for Americans. OY deals with the life of a perfectly regular woman, Taeko, in two parallel sides: her current life and her childhood. It figures that OY shows how Taekos childhood influences her present, which for the most part amounts to resentments and frustrations that come from realistic situations that have nothing to do with both regular & cultural entertainment and it succeeds at it like no other ever has.

In regular entertainment a story or person must involve all of these 3 criteria:
1st Pretty people and pure good or evil characters or any form of stereotype.
2nd Death in any form and more undue and usual/unrealistic suffering in order to force the audience to empathize with the story or character. Audiences should resent such trick, but instead they always fall for it.
3rd Either fantasy or distortion of reality (fiction). Fantasy is huge: vampires, zombies, aliens (not the illegal ones, of course), etc. Fiction is almost only about crime, romance or success in all their ways.

Real average life seems boring to portray BUT it's a surprising challenge to portray well. We, people, are complicated. Intellectual productions consistently fail at it by focusing disproportionately in dysfunctional relations, insanity and death.

Most of our thoughts, traumas and resentments come from minor but continual conflicts and rejections from people around us along with fears and failures. What most of us do is avoiding reality and turn to TV or any other of the unlimited options. NOW, this is the top value of Only Yesterday, this movie does deal with most of these minor but real issues.

No one in OY is gorgeous. Taeko never faced ghosts, witches, werewolves, war, gangs, giant evil corporations, etc. She was not even in passionate love of an older sister or lived any sort of romance, only a pathetic platonic relation; can it get more average? Taeko did have big aspirations, but they didn't imply epic journeys and challenges to reach absolute success. Her aspiration fulfillment was not really up to her, another amazing depart from common entertainment, where the central character is in control of her life, the narrative that most people want to believe.

Taeko's aspirations were actually sort of fantasy, to become an actress, but she was never ambitious for real and always kept a low profile. What she wanted was the real deal, to be a valuable member of her society, which in turn drove her to volunteer in a farm as an adult and as a child made her feel shame upon realizing she discriminated a poor classmate. It is quite uplifting that so many people were able to empathize with such a realistically elaborate portray of an average person, with her flaws and virtues in the real quest for meaning in life.

WARNING: Most issues displayed in Only Yesterday are universal, but youll fail to assimilate them if you're stuck to the stereotypes so popularly called today as cultural awareness, diversity, etc. Intentions are great, yet still wrong. We are human above all, all labels come after. For instance, one scene takes place in a public bath and one reviewer elsewhere was amazed at the lack of sexuality in the scene despite nudity. It was not sexual because it was a family place! In those public baths men and women are separated. Nothing unique there.  HOWEVER, if you badly need to stereotype theres a perfect scene for it!!! One afternoon with Taeko struggling with her mathematics homework, along with one of her adult sisters! You may not solve the puzzle (arithmetic in fact), but will definitively feel like a great person for trying so hard.

PS: A lot of new entertainment are ""reality shows"", please respect yourself and don't argue about them, Duck Dynasty above all.",1466380800,13,3858,4.915514592933948
7734061,4,B01E9O0Q0Q,"""Only Yesterday"" is an appropriate title for animation giant Studio Ghibli's film, as it really is a time capsule in more ways than one. Originally released in 1991, it never found a way to American shores until now, voiced by Daisy Ridley (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") and Dev Patel (""Slumdog Millionaire"") as the primary characters. But it's also a mature, low-key dramatic story about one woman's memories of her childhood, and whether she's truly living up to the hopeful dreams she once had.

While feeling a little outdated at times in terms of dialogue, ""Only Yesterday"" is perhaps the finest example of Studio Ghibli's timelessness. What set it apart from others at the time was its focus on telling a simple, adult-oriented story for female that wasn't about flying witches or magical princesses. It was groundbreaking then, and remains a powerful if simply-told story now. The central character is 27-year-old Taeko (Ridley), a Tokyo-native who has lived all of her life in the city, working a boring job and never finding the right man to marry. In Japanese culture the latter makes her something of a pariah, especially to her siblings. Even when she asks for time away for a vacation, her boss openly asks if it's because she got dumped by a boyfriend.

But that time off Taeko needs is to take stock of her life and embrace the girl she used to be, and so she heads off to the Yamagata countryside to visit distant relatives. The journey begins to rekindle memories of her life as a 5th-grader, and the people and events that shaped the woman has become and doesn't fully understand. The film is awash in Taeko's flashbacks, with some bleeding over into her current day thoughts. What we get are essentially a pair of intersecting stories centered on young Taeko, as she experiences first love, first friendships, puberty, and more. In the present, Taeko begins to forge a lasting emotional bond with Toshio (Patel), a cousin who not only introduces her to the wonders of organic farming, but helps her sort through her inner baggage.

The film is directed by the legendary Isao Takahata, who three years earlier had helmed the classic animated film, ""Grave of the Fireflies"", which I and many consider one of the greatest movies about war ever made. Takahata trades in the same powerful emotional currency to ""Only Yesterday"" as he did with ""Grave of the Fireflies"", and that includes dealing with some of Taeko's memories that aren't so pleasant. It becomes clear that Taeko had always felt some kind of alienation, long before she ever grew up. Like most things, it begins with something seemingly innocent, like the mocking she receives from boys about her menstrual cycle. But that feeling of isolation grows stronger due to the influence of her parents; a father who remains distant most of the time, and a mother who has a deeper connection with Taeko's sisters than with her.

So where's the twist? What's the shocking reveal that throws Taeko's life for a loop? Well, there isn't one. Individually, it's probably fair to say that many of Taeko's experiences are commonplace. But that's pretty much the point, isn't it? Put together as a whole, these seemingly unremarkable moments are what make Taeko the unique person she is. It may sound like it would be tedious, but there's something profound in ""Only Yesterday""'s simplicity. If this were a live-action film we'd be talking about how they don't make these kinds of character pieces anymore. What's interesting is that Japanese animation continues to produce them on a regular basis now, and it should come as no surprise we have Studio Ghibli to thank for it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-Yesterday-Blu-ray/dp/B01E9O0Q0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only Yesterday [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,74,3808,5.097756410256411

8758189,5,B01E9O0Q0Q,"Only Yesterday already has 139 reviews at time of writing. This review, however, may be the first to compare it to another, more recent Studio Ghibli film, Whispers of the Heart, also a love story. Whispers focuses on that moment, in later middle school or early high school, when our experience of love becomes something too cosmic to be represented by a puppy. For me it's nice to be reminded of that moment. Yet while Whispers presents young love via many realistic details, Whispers ends before its protaganists have had to wrestle with the ordinary disappointments of biological chemistry. Only Yesterday, on the other hand, counterposes two different time frames: the first a late middle-school frame in which the protagonist's body (as those of some classmates) becomes capable of conception; the second a late-20s frame in which the protagonist, perhaps for the first time, meets a partner who can appreciate and support her personal path to fulfillment. Not only is Only Yesterday's framework larger and more layered, its detail also cuts deeper. For example, it shows her father's incomprehension of what she is going through psychologically and his aggressive physical response. It shows how the late-20s version of the protagonist has found a degree of balance and happiness in life that one would not have predicted from her younger years -- yet it also shows her deeply unsure of herself.

In sum, both cartoons present conventional love stories touchingly, in a way that will likely satisfy anyone who likes love stories. But Only Yesterday presents the love story as a narrative commonplace that can be (because in this movie it is) subsumed by a person's (each person's) search for what is ultimately most meaningful for them. Both anims satisfy, but Only Yesterday is in a class by itself.",1536451200,,1807,5.063758389261745
