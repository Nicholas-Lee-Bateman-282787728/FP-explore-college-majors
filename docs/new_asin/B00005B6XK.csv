Have purchased roughly dozen Polish historical dramas and again I really enjoyed the film.  I received the film in three days, new and excellent service for my purchase.",1455062400,,276,4.956521739130435
7937049,4,B00005B6XK,"Romance, adventure, history, and a sharing of Polands bravery comes to life in this film.  Lotna, the star horse, gives a small view of the importance of the Polish Cavalry, and a special horse that fights the noise, shell fire, etc. while carrying his master.  You will be angered at the cheated love between a young soldier and his new bride, as war is the terminator and the spectre of death follows even the bravest of men and women.  I found the film provocative in the sense that it adds another dimension of how Polish life was affected during WWII.  A film with few words, but moving scenes, some pastoral and some war maddened.  Lotna will appeal to those who love horses, and will perhaps chuckle as to how this horse is part of the Polish Estate.",1212105600,,757,4.4963503649635035
7937050,4,B00005B6XK,"Andrzej Wajda is mostly known for his war trilogy (A Generation, Kanal, Ashes and Diamonds) shot in the 50's and his movies of the 70's and 80's than for the films he directed in the sixties. So I decided to buy the VHS version of LOTNA available here at Amazon to discover an example of what the great Polish director did during that decade. The quality of the copy presented by Polart is very bad and the colours washed-out.

LOTNA is the name of a gorgeous white horse given by the lord of a manor situated next to the Polish-German border to the cavalry captain Chodakiewicz who's been ordered to fight the first German foot troops which crossed the border in 1939. As the winchester in Anthony Mann's WINCHESTER '73, Lotna will be owned by several lancers who'll die while riding her and one understands soon that Lotna is a symbol for Poland.

A certain number of scenes are worthy to be remembered such as the battles between the German tanks and the Polish lancers or the visit of the castle of the first owner of Lotna. And I can't but urge you to see this film if you are a fan of Andrzej Wajda.",1145232000,5,1105,4.385365853658537
