8030520,3,B0002PYS2O,"This movie is about a fairly ordinary married couple who discover they both have syphilis when the wife has a blood test after becoming pregnant.  It is overly melodramatic; there are two female characters in the movie who immediately become suicidal when they find they have syphilis. And it contains some significant misinformation: a specialist in VD says that one of his patients got syphilis from smoking a borrowed pipe, and another medical doctor snatches his child away from the infected wife.  But it is not a ridiculous, so-bad-it's-good piece of hysteria like ""Reefer Madness"".

According to the website ""canuxploitation"", the movie was made in 1933, but not shown until 1937, when it was released by Educational Pictures, a Poverty Row outfit.  This seems to be correct.  The characters mention going to a speakeasy (Repeal was in late 1933), and it looks much better than anything Educational ever made on its own, suggesting it was sold to Educational after sitting on the shelf.

For 1933, the movie is remarkably even-handed.  The husband and wife who find they have syphilis are shown as thoroughly decent, well-to-do people.  The husband (engaged but not married at this point) is dragged out on a late-night, bar-crawling dinner date by a important client. That man drunkenly abandons his date, and after more drinking, the husband winds up sleeping with her.  This is handled tastefully; they are both attractive, intelligent adults who take a liking to each other and let nature take its course.  Although the woman turns out to have syphilis, she is unaware of it, and is portrayed as a nice person, if a bit of a playgirl.  She is grief-stricken when she learns of her condition, and informs the now-married young man as soon as she discovers it.  (The husband regretted his indiscretion with her and married his fiance pretty much the next day.)

Really, no-one in the film is portrayed as a bad person.  I thought this was a remarkably enlightened attitude for the period, although the melodramatic reactions attributed to the women when they learned they had syphilis were typical of the time.  Oddly, the VD specialist was the most judgmental person in the film; while showing his patients to the husband in order to shock him into accepting treatment, he remarks that one is blameless, this one was asking for it, and so on.  (The husband appears to have seen a quack doctor and thought he was cured.)

The movie does not have an elaborate plot, and is mostly somber and serious in tone, but it does not drag badly because it is only 52 minutes long.  It had enough of a budget for attractive and varied sets, and Edgar Ulmer's direction seemed skillful but unobtrusive.  It does not look at all like something a Poverty Row outfit such as Educational Pictures would have produced on its own.

The acting seemed like a mixed bag.  Diane Sinclair as the infected wife seemed very effective at conveying emotions wordlessly, but her character was a bit one-note, and was given oddly little to actually say.  Lyman Williams as the husband was more in the David Manners class. He had some presence and appeal, but not much range.  In the big emotional scene where the playgirl tries to tell him she has syphilis and that he and his wife probably do too, he conveys mainly blank incomprehension, followed by rather petulant anger.  It greatly damages sympathy for his character.  To be fair, Charlotte Merriam, as the playgirl is forced to go well over the top in that scene (she is convincingly attractive on their date).

Oddly, the three most recognizable names on the cast list all have minor parts: Jason Robards, Sr. is the VD specialist, Marceline Day, who starred opposite Buster Keaton in ""The Cameraman"" has a minor part as the wife of a family friend, and Harry Myers, who played the drunken millionaire in Chaplin's great ""City Lights"", played the drunken businessman here.

All in all, this movie is not bad. It is not particularly good either, and has little entertainment value for a modern audience.  But it does serve as a document of what even a reasonably enlightened view of syphilis was in the early 1930's: a serious disease and a social disgrace if it became known you had it, but if you could keep it quiet, *probably* not something to commit suicide over.  It's been a long 80 years!",1340496000,,4331,4.814864864864865
8030521,3,B0002PYS2O,"Guys, how many times has this happened to you?  You go out nightclubbin' with the guys from work, hook up with a fast and loose chickadee, and the next thing you know you've got strange sores on your kidney scraper and your wife is complaining of an itchy yoo hoo...oh the humanity!  Apparently enough of this was occurring back in the day to warrant a few edjumacational films to be made on the subject, including this little nugget of joy titled Damaged Lives (1933), the first `talkie' picture directed by Edgar G. Ulmer (The Man from Planet X, The Naked Dawn, The Amazing Transparent Man), who's probably best know for such Poverty Row features as The Black Cat (1934), the first film to team up Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi and Detour (1945), an amazing little noir feature definitely worth searching out.  Appearing in Damaged Lives is Lyman Williams (The Eleventh Commandment), Diane Sinclair (Tomorrow's Children), Marceline Day (By Appointment Only), Charlotte Merriam (The Avenger), Murray Kinnell (Think Fast, Mr. Moto), and Jason Robards Sr. (The Fatal Hour), father of actor Jason Robards.

Everything seems to be coming up roses for Donald Bradley Jr. (Williams). He just got promoted to executive assistant in his company (I suppose it helps if you father actually owns the business) and he's engaged to comely young woman named Joan (Sinclair).  But all that's about to change, for the worse I might add, all because of one reason...Donald couldn't keep it in his pants.  One night, after work, Donald goes out for a night on the town with a business associate named Nat, who also brings along a little blonde number named Elise.  After hitting a few gin joints, the trio end up at a swinging party at someone's home, and Nat, stewed to the gills, hooks up with another girlie, leaving Donald and Elise to fend for themselves.  The pair decides to hit the bricks, making the rounds prior to returning to Elise's posh pad for a nightcap.  Shortly afterwards Donald tries to take his leave, but Elise's feminine wilds, and a whole lot of booze, result in him spending the night.  The next day old Donald, feeling the pangs of guilt gnawing at his innards, spills his guts to Joan about his dalliance, and not only does she forgive him, but they decide to elope...time passes and things are going aces with the newlyweds, that is until Donald gets a desperate call from Eloise...seems she's got the clap, and she fears she may have passed it on to Donnie.  Donnie slips into a state of denial, you know, the whole `this can't be happening to me' thing, but guess what?  Not only does Donnie have the taint, but also he's given it to Joan, who learns about it during a routine check-up...oh Donnie, what have you done?

First off, I want to say Donald was a real snarky a-hole.  You may have already gotten that impression given the information I've supplied, but you don't know the half of it...when we first see him, he's only just recently received his promotion, and he's barking orders out like he owns the place.  Eventually he tones it down a few notches to the level of twerp.  At no point in the story did I ever feel any empathy for the character.  Even if I'd ever had what he had I still wouldn't have felt anything for him.  He had everything going for him, a cushy job, lots of money, an attractive (and forgiving) girlfriend and still that wasn't enough...oh well, you lay down with dogs and you wake up with fleas.  The best part of this film for me was when Donald was taken to a clinic by his friend, who also happened to be his wife's physician, and the doctor at the clinic takes Donald on a tour of the examination rooms, all of which happen to be populated with individuals suffering from some form of VD.  You see, Donald was still in a serious state of denial, so the physician at the clinic hoped to open his eyes by revealing to him some rather severe cases, the result of the transmitted diseases going unchecked for lengthy periods of time.  This ended up turning into a sort of sideshow of disgusting medical maladies, as behind each door the situation was worse than the last.  By the end, skinny Donald looked like he was about to keel over from all he had seen.  As far as the film itself I thought it was very well put together, featuring a strong and flowing sense of direction.  Actually, it's probably one of the best made `edjumacational' features I've ever seen.  Things did seem a bit overly melodramatic near the end, but then again, the subject manner was certainly more taboo back when the movie was released than it is today.  Nobody wants a venereal disease, and if you get one, you not likely to go announcing it on the roof tops, but I got to figure back in the day the social ramifications alone were much more severe if word of infection ever got out.  Another really humorous part of the film comes near the end, as Donald and Joan are visiting another couple, which they consider friends.  This other couple had a child, and previously in the film we'd seen Joan chumming it up with the kid.  After the taint has been revealed, the kid wants Joan to pick him up, but the father gets a little freaky fearing the disease might somehow rub off on his kid.  Could it have happened?  Probably not, but he wasn't going to take any chances...talk about an uncomfortable scene.  Needless to say, Donald and Joan took their leave shortly afterwards...that's right, take your taint from our home.  I will say this for Donald, once he got past the denial stage, he turned into a `glass is half full' type, while his wife was definitely a `glass is half empty' persona (she's all like ""We're dead inside...this horrible thing has killed us!"").  I did like how the subject matter was handled, though...the film was informative and tended to shy away from the exploitive nature of the material or being overly judgmental of the characters.  All in all an entertaining and enlightening feature, still relevant after some seventy plus years.

The picture quality on this Alpha Video DVD release is rough, but watchable.  The picture quality is faded and slightly blurry, but given the age of the feature, this may be as good a transfer print as was available.  I've never really associated Alpha Video with high standards of quality, but at least their prices are nice.  The audio is about as good as the picture, that is to say not great, but passable.  Included on the DVD is an extra feature in that of a 17 minute edjumacational short titled The Innocent Party (1959), released by the Kansas State Board of Health.  It involves a high school kid contracting syphilis from an encounter with a trampy girl, and then he unknowingly passes it along to his steady girlfriend...smooth move, Ex-Lax.
