1802381,5,B00007855L,"I agree with the above.

This is certainly the best movie I have seen dealing with an eating disorder.  It takes you into the mind of the sufferer...and a true one at that.  Because Tracy Gold made this movie just getting out of treatment for anorexia, it trult depicts what hell a person is in with this demond.  It also shares light on what a famiuly goes through as a loved one suffers.  Alothough not everyone suffers the same, has the same help, or suffers from the same reasons I am sure that if you suffer from an eating disorder, or have a loved on who does yoiu will relate.",1181865600,14,583,4.263636363636364
1802382,5,B00007855L,"This isn't the first movie that deals with eating disorders, but it's the best. The acting is first rate, the story is compelling and it's told in a sensitive manner that others haven't been able to accomplish. This is a true story and that fact makes this movie all the more touching. This could be any family, in any city or town in America. You really care about the people in this movie and hope everything turns out okay. I think that it's some of the best acting I've seen from any of the actors especially Tracey Gold who drew on her own experiences to portray the devestating effects these illnesses cause.",1179187200,11,614,4.491071428571429
1802383,5,B00007855L,"This is a good movie for anyone who needs to see what having an eating disorder does toa person and their family. I first was introduced to it when my best friend started to have one. Luckily i was able to help her long before it had gotten to this point. This is a very riveting story, though. If you have a teen, preteen or even an adult in your life who is suffering from this kind of disease, watch it and have them see it. It might help to save thier life",1243123200,,460,3.956989247311828
1802384,5,B00007855L,"I have no idea why this movie is so expensive (don't think I have found anything less than $100) but I actually watched it for free on YouTube and it blew me away.  Having suffered with anorexia, I found this movie very realistic, including the ending, contrary to the one negative post.
I think it is very true to life, and also should help family and other people in general understand the complexities of the disease.",1231372800,3,420,4.526315789473684
1802385,5,B00007855L,"This has got to be one of my favorite lifetime movies that deals with the ever growing issues of young girls and eating disorders. I am 19 and a sufferer of an eating disorder myself, and I really admire Tracey Gold for everything she's done, especially this movie. I can't imagine how difficult it must have been for her to pretend to be engaging in eating disordered behaviors, and play an anorexic girl in this movie, seeing as how it was filmed while she was in recovery from anorexia. Brilliant. Which is another thing that's so great about the movie-the fact that its so real. The rest of the cast is great too, and you can almost feel their pain as you watch them watch their daughter/sister/niece/friend starve herself, nearly to death.

The wonderful thing about this movie is that it not only shows the damaging mental, emotional, and physical effects that the sufferer feels, but it also shows the devastating effect that it has on the sufferers loved ones.

Another great thing about the movie is the ending. While its typical that nancy (the main character in the movie) recovers, she also has a very inspirational message at the end that brings me to tears",1213315200,10,1170,4.674757281553398
1802386,3,B00007855L,Good show to explain an eating disorder. Not the best I have ever seen. End is unrealistic,1202428800,2,90,4.352941176470588
1802387,5,B00007855L,"The movie is one of the few really great ones out there. It's realistic, which sometimes with eating disorders people tend to over act and make it seem too unreal. I reccomend it highly!",1196121600,,186,4.5
1802388,4,B00007855L,"This movie is truly one of the most memorable of all TV movies. It is by no means a good movie, but it is truly enjoyable, sad, and sometimes funny. I know this is insensitive given the ""too close to home"" nature of the issue for Tracy Gold, but this movie is very predictable and corny.
And by all means, I find it endlessly entertaining.",1194393600,3,339,4.230769230769231
1802389,5,B00007855L,I have always been a big fan of this movie. It is very hard to find. I was surprised when I found it on Amazon for as cheap as I did. A great price for a great movie.,1193011200,,166,3.3947368421052633
1802390,5,B00007855L,"Well, it would be nice for all the sellers to have the condition of the movie, whether or not it comes with all the printing. Some of the sellers don't have all that information. I'm adding this to my review in hopes of finding these four movies. I am looking for Seduction in a Small Town (1997), A Girl Named Sooner(1975), The High Price of Passion (1986), Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story (1991)? I would like to have these movies. I haven't been able to find them. I am very satisfied with the service I have gotten so far ordering on amazon. I have gotten everything I have ordered before I was scheduled to get them, so I am very happy and satisfied. For the Love of Nancy was a very good movie. I highly recommend it.",1192665600,,734,4.25
1802391,3,B00007855L,I liked this film. The seriousness of the theme is a crucial event in our time and I believe it gives plenty of information for those going through the same thing.,1188950400,,163,4.290322580645161
1802392,5,B00007855L,"I first watched this movie on TV when it came out.  I thought it was good then, so I decided to purchase the DVD.  It's still very good.  One thing that helps this movie is that Tracey Gold could draw from her own experience of having Anorexia Nervosa.  I think she was still recovering when this movie was made.  The other characters were very realistic as well.  If I remember right, this was loosely based on a true story.  Even if it's not, it's probably inspired from many families' stories.  I would recommend this movie to people who want to learn more about eating disorders.  I would caution people who are either actively engaging in or recovering from AN about watching this movie, as it could be triggering (that has been my experience).",1188777600,2,749,4.571428571428571

7974309,3,B00007855L,"For the price of this DVD, I had assumed that it would've been better quality but it wasn't. The movie was grainy. I wouldn't recommend anyone
 of my friends buying it beyond a $20 price tag, there are other movies with the same message, higher quality resolution, and sorry to be so harsh but better acting.
I had seen this movie years ago and don't remember the acting to be so bad but it does give you an idea of the mind frame of someone struggling with anorexia.
As for the shipping it came promptly.",1516233600,,505,4.315789473684211
7974310,5,B00007855L,I love this movie i still can remember the 1st time i saw it. But not happy that its so expensive to buy. Hopefully in due time the price will drop down,1454025600,,152,3.78125

7974315,5,B00007855L,"Tracey Gold did an excellent job in this movie.  Since she has struggled with eating disorders in the past she did a good job acting this role and making it believable.  This is a good movie for anyone to watch that wants to learn more about eating disorders, and what to look for in someone who may have one.",1368748800,2,309,4.220338983050848
7974316,5,B00007855L,"This is a great movie, Tracey Gold does a terrific job! This movie can be triggering for some. It does show some tricks of the trade.
Please watch with caution!
This movie is rare, out of print, get your copy before its too late!",1338163200,3,229,4.2272727272727275
7974317,5,B00007855L,"I've watched For the Love of Nancy too many times to count & I'm always impressed. Tracy Gold had actually suffered from an eating disorder, so it's very easy to get caught up in the movie as you're watching it.",1243382400,,211,4.3
