3938461,2,B002JHDBUI,"Caught these three on the SyFy channel at one time or another.  This set is not all that re-watchable.  I don't recommend it unless you have seen them on SyFy and you like them.

Blood Monkey:
TV Movie
90 min
Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller
January 27, 2008
USA

Students are taken on a field trip by their professor.  The professor (F. Murray Abraham) knows that the monkeys are killers but yet he takes his students in their jungle anyway.  This is mediocre B SciFi movie and a disappointment to see F. Murray Abraham lower his standards to this level.

Maneaster:
TV Movie
88 min
Horror/Thriller
2007
USA

The town sheriff (Gary Busey) hunts an escaped tiger.  A young boy befriends it even though it kills several people.  I didn't turn it off, but I don't see this as re-watchable.

In the Spider's Web:
TV Movie
90 min
Horror/Sci-Fi
August 26, 2007
USA

While a group of students trek through the jungle one is bitten by a spider.  They find an American doctor (Lance Henriksen) to help, but they aren't sure if he is really trying to save him or use him in an experiment.
