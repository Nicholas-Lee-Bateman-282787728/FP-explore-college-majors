Whether or not you're a fan of opera, you'll appreciate the humor found in each situation, especially if you've experienced these various stages of marital life for yourself!  If you're a musician you'll recognize the musical styles of various famous composers incorporated within the scenes--Puccini, Verdi, Menotti, Handel, Vivaldi, and Mozart, and appreciate the humorous and pertinent ways in which they're employed within each scene.
