6097640,5,B00GOYHSBU,"Released to Syfy during Halloween, 2013, ""Scarecrow"" chronicles events at a supposedly haunted farm where a school detention group goes to do some work. A scary-looking creature appears and starts picking them off one-by-one.

There are some similarities to the hallowed ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) in that the group takes refuge in a farm house but, unlike that film, they don't spend the entire story there. The creature pursues them to other environments.

Why do I rate ""Scarecrow"" as high as I do? For one, the filmmakers and actors take the material seriously and so the film never devolves into parody or camp. As such, the viewer is able to take it seriously. Secondly, the CGI monster is excellent. It's scary-looking and changes shape constantly while remaining the same basic appearance.

Thirdly, the film features a quality cast of women. There are no less than FIVE, all stunning or near-stunning in their own unique way, starting with the blond (Lanie McAuley) in the teaser. From there we get four petite brunettes, beginning with the curvaceous delinquent played by Julia Maxwell, whose role is way too brief, followed by Nicole Muoz, Lacey Chabert and Brittney Wilson. Lacey emerges as the film's protagonist while Brittney becomes the quasi-antagonist. Lastly, the Vancouver-area locations are effective for this type of film, particularly the superlative ""ship graveyard"" in the final act.

The film runs 86 minutes.

GRADE: B+/A-

CRITICS' QUESTIONS ANSWERED (***SPOILER ALERT***)

If the farm is abandoned who planted all the corn? Kristen obviously rented out the land to the neighboring farmer in order to pay the property taxes. Why is the nerd in detention to start with? Because nerdy misfits sometimes get detention too. Why does the creature show five claws/fingers? Because it has five claws/fingers. Why does the scarecrow monster look more like a burnt-to-crisp spider than a scarecrow? Because it's not a scarecrow, but rather some kind of demonic creature; the locals simply dubbed it the ""Scarecrow"" a hundred years earlier and the name stuck.

Why are the bales of hay conveniently placed like steps? Obviously to make it convenient to climb to the second story door of the barn. Why does the cop car start and not the truck? Because there was nothing wrong with it; the owner of the old truck, however, said that it had a problem overheating. Why did the driver of the cop car swerve when the thing appeared on the road and not run it over? It was a split second decision and the sudden appearance of the creature shocked him; besides, it's clear that running the monster over wouldn't have harmed it.

Why does the ex-boyfriend bravely roll under the vehicle and set it on fire with the creature there with him? He was already mortally wounded and, since he was going to die anyway, he wanted to (try to) take the monster out with his brave final act. Why is the girl ground-up by the farm machine and not the scarecrow? It was repeatedly stated throughout the movie that the creature couldn't die; or, at least, people didn't THINK it could die. Besides, the creature obviously doesn't have a concrete physical form and is probably more spiritual than physical in nature; thus the machine couldn't harm it.

What are the limitations of the creature, as far as time of day when it appears or how far it can travel from the farm? It's obviously some kind of territorial demon attached to the farm & the town and seeks out the Miller family as prey, plus anyone that gets in the way; it's never disclosed how far it can travel from the farm or town, but the ship graveyard didn't seem too distant, maybe 5-7 miles. How did the ship explode without a spark? She broke the line by the tank and then made sparks with the ax, which caught the gasoline (or whatever) on the floor on fire, which spread to the tank within a minute or so and thus the ship blew.",1394841600,14,3896,4.784226190476191
6097641,4,B00GOYHSBU,This film was actually quite good. And the monster was rather cool looking. The gore and acting were all done very well. I can't complain at all. And I will watch it again. It was just a fun horror movie to watch. I'm happy I purchased it,1394409600,4,238,4.085106382978723
6097642,4,B00GOYHSBU,"First off, I'm a collector and fan  of scarecrow horror movies. Most of them, I thought were pretty good. This is one of them. I thought the scarecrows looked like scarecrows for the most part and the CGI were pretty good for them. And they looked pretty cool. Good acting too. One to pick up.",1394323200,2,293,4.327272727272727
6097643,3,B00GOYHSBU,"Scarecrow is a horror film in which if it weren't for Lacey Chabert looking fine and some gory aftermaths, there wouldn't be anything to it. Even though the movie is paced reasonably well, it lacks the charm that a movie about a killer scarecrow should have. Also, the titular monster is a bad CGI effect if ever there was one. Why didn't they cast a man in a suit for the part? It would have been far more effective.",1393545600,,417,4.291139240506329
6097644,3,B00GOYHSBU,"The image of the scarecrow awakens a deeply rooted primal fear within me.  Im not exactly sure why, but theres something about it that makes my skin crawl.  As such, movies about scarecrows are a true horrific treat for me.  The SyFy Channel released a movie simply titled SCARECROW last year, and I have to admit that it is one of the better ones produced by their studios over the last couple of years.  And while not perfect, this flick contains some creepy effects and nice intensity.

SCARECROW is shot well overall, and its production value looks pretty high.  I like the locations used in the filming; the desolate farm surrounded by corn is a great backdrop for building terror.  And the boat graveyard, in which the last section of the movie takes place, is perfectly eerie.

The special effects are good, too, especially for a TV movie.  The CG that is used for the scarecrow looks good, and theres some very nice gore throughout.  One particularly gruesome scene shows the sliced open thigh of a girl who falls through a rotted floor.  The good effects combined with a close-up shot of the wound will make even the heartiest of gore-hounds cringe.

I am impressed with the acting in SCARECROW as well.  Granted, it is not super-high caliber, but the cast does a great job nonetheless.  Robin Dunne and Lacey Chabert, as the main characters, play off of each other well and portray a solid sense of onscreen chemistry.  Likewise, the supporting cast do a lot to lend credibility to this production.

But even though the film is a lot of fun, it does have some glaring flaws.  First and foremost for me is the lack of character development.  We are never really given many reasons to care about the characters, which in turn tones down the tension quite a bit.  Secondly, the legend of the scarecrow is never fully fleshed out.  It is hinted at many times, but theres never any solid conclusion.

Still, SCARECROW is entertaining and fans of lower-budgeted features should enjoy this one.  This isn't schlocky horror, like some of the other SyFy Channel titles; instead, this is a true attempt at bona fide terror.  And while the end result might not be perfect, it is certainly worth checking out.  I cant wait to see what SyFy and director Sheldon Wilson do next.",1393200000,4,2274,4.670025188916877
6097645,1,B00GOYHSBU,This movie is utter garbage one of syfy's worst...It looks nothing like a scarecrow. I disliked the product because Syfy didn't take their time with it and the last few years syfy movies haven't been all that good anyway.,1392076800,2,221,4.6923076923076925

A family secret has been buried for 150 years, but because a couple of teens trespassed on private property, the evil has been released. Now it is killing anyone connect with the original family or comes in contact with the only living descendent (a lovely young woman). Lots of blood and violence and death.

6097653,4,B00GOYHSBU,Definitely one of SyFy's better movies. Guess they decided to spend a little money and make a well done film. The scarecrow itself was quite creepy looking.  I say it's surely worth watching.,1457740800,,191,4.787878787878788

6097656,5,B00GOYHSBU,"Lacey Chabert alone is worth the price of this dvd. Hard to believe that little nerdy girl from Party of five has grown up to be one of the best young starlets in the horror genre. The scarecrow monster is similar to other previously released syfy channel monsters (goblin comes to mind), but still has memorable kills in this movie.",1453420800,2,333,4.566666666666666

I read some OK to good movie reviews for Scarecrow so I decided to check it out for myself. Scarecrow is nothing more than a time waster. If you're looking for a movie to watch & got some time to waste then Scarecrow is for you. Even then you'll probably be just waiting for it to be over like I was",1432080000,,417,3.9176470588235293

6097662,5,B00GOYHSBU,"I was lucky enough to watch this movie first on the Syfy Channel before buying it for future viewings (I knew exactly what I was getting).  The plot is based on the standard slasher formula, strand a bunch of kids far from civilization then pick them off one at a time.  It begins with a simple cornfield and a dopey guy planning a prank.  But first, he needs a roll in the hay with his girlfriend.  The trouble with old barns, as they soon find out, is old ladders will fail resulting in a bloody injury and the release of a thing that sometimes looks inky and liquid, sometimes burnt and fibrous.  What is it?  That's something that's never properly explained.  And since the scarecrow in the cornfield stays put, it can't be that.  It was, for over 100 years, chained in the lower regions of said barn.  Trying to fathom what it might be is a fruitless venture, it just is, and it wants all the relations of the family that trapped it there.  Anyone else who gets in its way is just asking for trouble.

What I appreciated the most about this horror flick was the unconventional monster and that they took the mayhem on the road in their attempts to escape it.  The action isn't confined to the farm, the barn, the cornfield, or the farmhouse.  It also isn't limited to a single day or night.  ""Waking"" this thing up has serious consequences.

This is one time when sticking to a formula really pays off.",1407283200,2,1407,4.39922480620155

8625878,2,B00GOYHSBU,"This is a bland and forgettable horror movie. It's watchable, but nothing scary or innovative in the slightest. A group of unlikable teens is sent on a ""detention field-trip"" to an old, isolated farm. There, their teacher plans to use them as an unpaid labor force, tasked with prepping the towns 100th annual scarecrow festival. By pure accident, the teens unleash an ancient evil scarecrow (that proceeds to murder them one-by-one). Of course all telephones and vehicles stop working, so no one can call for help or escape. Yawn. The scarecrow itself is far from impressive. It's just a CGI mess of twisted branches and mud. The kills are all unimaginative and TV-friendly. The synopsis refers to this film as a ""supernatural twist"" on movies like The Breakfast Club... yet the characters and dialog are nowhere near that intelligent or endearing.",1531008000,,849,5.028368794326241

8625881,2,B00GOYHSBU,"Anyone giving this movie 5 stars is either: dishonest, commenting on the promptness of delivery, or just kinda dumb.  I have to admit that the production values were high enough for a film with a major release, and the special effects, both practical and CGI were done really well.  I don't even  have a problem with the acting.  I'm sure if the actors were given even a half-way decent script, they would have done a good job.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is crap because the director, writer or editor couldn't figure out how to tell a very simple story.  They introduced plot points that went absolutely nowhere, or were about characters that we just didn't/couldn't care about.  I saw a few things introduced that seemed like they'd be interesting, but then immediately fizzled.  What was with the locket?  And, of course, there were way too many ""Hey, the lights just went out, let's all split up and look around"" moments.  Less than halfway through, I was rooting for the monster because it was all that stood between a happy ending and any of the characters living long enough to breed.

Overall, there should have been a few more victims added, a few more death scenes, and way less talking.  That way, it could have been a good gore-fest instead of the awkward mess it was.",1524009600,2,1282,4.674107142857143
