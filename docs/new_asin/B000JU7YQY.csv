8153184,4,B000JU7YQY,An Empire Conquered tells some of the stories about some of the early Christian martyrs long forgotten or hidden. Brought out in the tape and very interesting to me is the fact that many of these places are today underneath some of the churches in Rome (even if they are 40 feet or more underneath). This video is one that I use with my world history class every year.,1264982400,,368,4.3478260869565215
8153185,5,B000JU7YQY,"This video is a fantastic documentary on the early life in the Church.  The video is not ""preachy"", but gives quotes and histories of the life of early Church life using the lives of five saints.  The narration is involved, without be exuberant and without being stoic.  Film in Rome, you get to see many of the Christian sites.  I use it in my religion classes for High School, and it holds their attention.  I would not recommended for kids.",1157673600,,443,4.4875
