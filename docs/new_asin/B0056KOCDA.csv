4592528,5,B0056KOCDA,"Okay....to keep this short, let me say up-front that I am not an anime geek. All I want to add is that for us normal folks that grew up watching these shows after school, it's great to be able to see them again. The characters haven't changed or had a ""re-boot"" to something that isn't recognizable. Beautiful art, complex characters and a love triangle that makes some soap operas look like 5 year-olds playing a sand box. There's no point in griping about what it isn't, I think it's always better to appreciate it for what it is: A space opera...hope this helps.",1334016000,2,565,4.495145631067961
4592529,5,B0056KOCDA,"Let's be honest..this was made in 1984 so don't  expect too much from the graphics (although I think they are fantastic).  I grew up watching this in Germany (my dad was in the Air Force) & I loved the sounds of the jets and this anime always kept me dreaming of space flight and the world of tomorrow.  If you are a true Macross fan then you will absolutely love this!  Sure it has its corny moments but the overall plot and music make up for that! I feel like I time travel back to when I was a kid every time I watch this and hear the amazing music in the background.  Although it never says it..I truly believe that this is ""dedicated to our pioneers"" as well.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!",1330992000,3,704,4.028776978417266
4592530,4,B0056KOCDA,"It is a regrettable reality that one of the most beloved animated films ever created in Japan has never been officially released in its full form outside the island nation of its birth. That this particular work of anime shares a history with a genre defining animated series that helped introduce Japanese animation to a wider audience is all the more frustrating for anime fans around the world. That film is commonly called ""Macross: Do You Remember Love?"" released in Japan in July of 1984. For those admirers of anime that long to have this  movie in their collection, there is hope in the form of ""The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? Perfect Edition,"" an unlicensed ""DVD+Soundtrack CD"" collection of this revered film, offered through amazon.com.

""Do You Remember Love?"" is a feature film retelling of the television series ""Super Dimension Fortress Macross,"" which premiered on Japanese television in October of 1982. Running for a total of 36 episodes, ""Macross"" became a highly regarded anime creation, bringing acclaim to the animation company that created it, Studio Nue, and admiration to members of its production crew, notably: Shoji Kawamori,story creator and lead mechanical designer; Haruhiko Mikimoto, character designer; and Mari Iijima, singer and voice actress, who portrayed the character Lynn Minmay in the TV series and movie.

""Macross"" is a space adventure tale of human and alien conflict told from the point of view of three young people: Hikaru Ichijyo, a gifted fighter pilot; Lynn Minmay, a popular ""idol singer;"" and Misa Hayase, a duty-bound military officer aboard the Super Dimension Fortress Macross. The Macross is an alien spacecraft that crashlanded on Earth in the recent past, containing technology that advanced human society. The ship was so colossal that an entire city came to be built within it. The Macross' size was a harbinger of the threat the people of Earth would come to face in the form of the Zentradi, an alien race of giants that would eventually wage a genocidal war on all of humanity. Only the bravery of Hikaro and his fellow pilots, and significantly, the voice of Lynn Minmay, would be able to defend humankind from a terrible fate.

The ""Macross"" TV series came to be first enjoyed by an audience outside of Japan when it was edited into an epic animation trilogy in America called ""Robotech,"" overseen by the Harmony Gold production company and Japan's Tatsunoko Productions. This 85 episode series was supervised by American producer Carl Macek, and consisted of what came to be called the 36 episode ""Macross Saga;"" followed by ""the Robotech Masters,"" a revision of the 1984 anime series, the ""Super Dimension Calvary Southern Cross,"" which ran for 23 episodes; and concluding with ""Robotech: The New Generation,"" a reworking of 1983's ""Genesis Climber Mospeada,"" a 25 episode anime show. Premiering on American television in September 1985, ""Robotech"" would mark a turning point in the exposure of Japanese animation to audiences in the United States and later, around the world.

But ""Robotech"" would also play a role in the movie ""Do You Remember Love?,"" as well as many other anime incarnations of the ""Macross"" franchise being unable to be legally seen by fans of the saga. Due to legal conflicts between Harmony Gold, Tatsunoko Productions, and Studio Nue, ""Macross"" anime like ""Do You Remember Love?"" have been prevented from being released to the world-wide home entertainment market.

Thus, anime fans have this alternative, the ""Perfect Edition."" This 2 disk set contains the ""Macross"" movie with its original Japanese language audio track along with an English language dub track with the options of English and/or Spanish subtitles. I suggest watching and listening to the film with the original Japanese dialogue. The English dub is inferior and detracts from fully enjoying the movie. Another negative with the DVD is the use of on-screen karaoke text during scenes featuring Lynn Minmay singing. Unfortunately, the viewer cannot disable or remove them from the video picture. Visually, the DVD format is a great showcase for anime and even this unlicensed version of ""Do You Remember Love?"" reveals the amazing artistry of this film. Its creators were at the peak of their storytelling powers, and given a bigger financial budget than they had on the TV series, Shoji Kawamori and his colaborators produced a spectacular theatrical space opera. The animation is beautifully fluid, the background settings are rich in color and detail. Viewing this film is an enthralling experience.

The ""Perfect Edition's"" second disk is the music and vocal soundtrack to the movie and it is a special treat. ""Do You Remember Love?"" featured a thrilling score by Kentaro Haneda, based on themes he composed for the original TV series plus new music. The soundtrack also features the enthusiastic vocal talent of Mari Iijima, bringing the voice of Lynn Minmay to life. Even after nearly 30 years, her songs bring chills of delight to this old anime fan.

""Macross: Do You Remember Love?"" is one of the great works of anime and truly deserves to be given a proper release to a public that cherishes it. Because this ""Perfect Edition"" is an unlicensed bootleg copy of the film, I've chosen to rate this release with 4 stars with the hope that this 5 star film will someday reach its audience in a presentation worthy of its greatness.",1330387200,44,5423,5.078563411896745
4592531,5,B0056KOCDA,"Macross Do you Remember Love is one of my all time favorite Anime movies. One of my favorite movies in general. The animation, character design, mechanical design and overall aesthetics are superb. This is Shoji Kawamori's masterpiece and I just love it so much. There is a love triangle, good vs evil, conquering evil with love and music, and awesome transforming robots created by one of the designers who helped create the original transformers. This is MUCH better than transformers though. If one has not watched the entirety of the original series Super Dimensional Fortress Macross, for which this is an alternate universe retelling of, then the story may be slightly confusing. However it is still worth watching even for a newcomer. The English dub is pretty terrible so watch it with the subtitles if you can. This particular DVD has very good video quality much improved from several versions I had previously owned. I highly recommend this to any and everyone. Note however that it may not be appropriate for small children with one (relatively tame) nude shower scene that lasts a few seconds and some war-violence throughout. If you like transforming robots then this is absolutely compulsory viewing. Brilliant and inspiring.",1315958400,,1240,5.113300492610837
4592532,3,B0056KOCDA,"Any fan of macross and robotech will love this interpretation about the TV series in a movie style format. This is a great DVD to have in your collection. Now for the DVD it self, to me it looks imported from over seas. The packaging seems to be well manufactured but the DVD seems to be cheaply made. It might look to some as a high end boot leg or something you could have done yourself. Watching the DVD; the title screen and menu selection looks home made but navigates properly. The actual movie itself has some great animation; some parts seem to have been re mastered while other scenes seem to be the original cells from 1984 just transferred on to DVD as you get some blurry effects. One thing I do not like is the freaking karaoke English and Japanese words every time minmay sings - and I mean every time, it's distracting. It can't be turned off as it's not a subtitle. The original didn't have this. It would be great if we could just get a high quality untouched version of this classic in the states. The English dub is extremely horrible! This is suppose to be a love story not a 1980's kung fu flick. That's what the English dub voices sound like. LOL I can't say enough about how horrible the English dub is. There is way better fan edits on YOU Tube when it comes to English dub. So I recommend watching it in Japanese with the English subtitle to get the maximum effect of emotions the story is trying to display. Final thoughts; this is probably the best version of this movie we can get here in the states, and for under $20, $15.95 plus shipping, is a great buy for this classic movie and a must have for any macross or robotech fan.",1313712000,7,1656,4.310897435897436

It has been so long since seeing this, and as of recently, was only able to see bits and pieces on You Tube. My only gripe with this film is the english dubbing. It stinks on Ice. But from what I remember originally was watching it with english subtitles. And for this DVD its the only way to go. The english dub appears to be a low budget late to the game addition. I have seen better fan dubs on You Tube. I do however suggest any fans of Macross, pick this movie up when its available.",1313539200,2,569,4.0

Decent widescreen presentation, professional packaging and nice to have Japanese/English audio & English subtitle options. Bonus soundtrack disc a plus too, if you don't already have it. Only annoying thing was the karaoke titling during the song numbers, which aren't optional and take you out of the film.

4592538,1,B0056KOCDA,"This is a pirated edition.  Do not buy it.

I have the official special edition release of this film on a Region 2 disk directly from Japan, and last I checked with the two big American anime-importers, the export rights to Macross are mired in a web of legalese that has yet to be sorted out, and the special edition did not come with a soundtrack.  Additionally, there is more than one special edition for this film, the larger coming in a large box with loads of extra goodies in it; all of which are Region 2 disks.

There is no publisher nor studio mentioned here, which should give you a clue.  Your next clue is that this is a region free disk.  There is no region free disc of this movie.

Buy the real thing from Japan.  Do not purchase this disk.",1375401600,10,756,4.2377622377622375
4592539,5,B0056KOCDA,"Though available subbed from several companies, this version includes the English dub produced in Hong Kong for Toho's '84 or 5 export video; the acting (by anonymous seiyuu heard in many dubs released by various companies--Family Home Entertainment, Celebrity Video, etc.--back in the '80's, prior to the emergence of dedicated anime firms like US Renditions, AnimEigo & Central Park Media) is wooden and awkward, and the translation is pretty poor, but at least one can watch the film without having to read subtitles, which, by the way, in this case were excellently translated.
Interestingly enough (to me anyway), the songs (of which there are many, by the film's plucky aidoru Lynn Minmay, voiced by Mari Iijima) have Japanese lyric subs, and romaji renderings that flow onto the screen, karaoke fashion, in time with the singing (done on many fansubs).
As for the film itself--well, I covered that sufficiently in my review of Macross Flashback 2012, I think...
Oh, there's also a copy of the CD soundtrack, which is cool.
But, alas, there are no extras; one would think they could've at least thrown in the three theatrical trailers provided on the domestic video.
Anyway, in conclusion, if you don't have this film, this is definitely the version to get.
Unless it's available from somebody on Blu-Ray...

4592540,4,B0056KOCDA,"Do you Remember Love? is worth watching because of the differences between it and the TV series. Hikaru doesn't meet Minmay until after she becomes a celebrity; Roy Fokker no longer has the stupidest death in recorded history; the Zentradi men and women are at war with each other instead of simply segregated; Earth is even less fortunate this time around, if you can believe that. There is also considerably more nudity and violence than I remember being in the series. If you can get past Minmay's sappy love songs, you'll find a classic anime that won't disappoint.",1371772800,2,569,4.816326530612245
4592541,5,B0056KOCDA,It's Macross in all its glory and all in a great dvd collection!! My childhood memories come back all suddenly!!,1371686400,,112,4.65
4592542,3,B0056KOCDA,"As a long time Macross fan, I have been trying to find an actual, legitimate DVD release of Macross: DYRL.  And while I am going to say that the movie is a stellar recap of the series with top-notch animation for 1984, I am going to provide a review for this DVD in particular.  Now, this is for the Macross: Do You Remember Love? (Perfect Edition) from Crescent Media which this review should be posted under.

  For starters, this package is very well done and comes in a near professional-grade material.  It is produced in Spain, I believe with what stickers are on the shrink-wrap, and comes with the film on DVD and ""the soundtrack"" on CD.  The outer box, case, and discs all have full-color print and very slick, glossy packaging.  A lot of care was taken into making this release as professional as possible.  This is all a plus for a Macross collector that cannot afford the more expensive collectables.  However, there are some issues I've seen for this release that I want to warn potential buyers about, and I will attempt to do this without being overly critical or nit-picky.

  The first thing I want to warn buyers about is that this is not an 'Official' release, at least, not from Big West.  There may be some sort of loop-hole this company went through to produce this or obtain the rights, but this is, at best, a high-quality fan-sub/dub.  I say this because I did some research into the company Crescent Media and what I found from it suggests that this release is not on a large-scale operation or in correlation to major production standards.

  With that said, the video transfer is fairly sharp, but it is not the best I've seen.  There are several un-cut (meaning, not coming from the edited, but official, blu-ray or Clash of the Bionoids) versions circling around on the internet with a better quality transfer than this.  In fact, I'd be hard-pressed to say this transfer may actually be one of those, but I cannot confirm that speculation.  I will say that, if you're not a perfectionist like I am, you will not mind it that much.  It plays, and doesn't look too bad, but I do think the black box around the studio logo that first produced this movie that should play before the film starts is pretty shady in my opinion.

  Audio is standard and nothing really to note other than they chose to include a really bad English dub.  Even if you prefer dubbing, I would still recommend the original Japanese audio track and subtitles.

  That brings me to my biggest gripe, which is the menu and the subtitling that are both pretty substandard with everything else I've seen from this release.  The menu is a standard static image that is very ""fuzzy"" due to up-scaling from it's original size and with large English text options that are obviously dated.  Secondly, the subtitles are really large and, as people have said before me, cover up the original Japanese subtitling for the Zentraedi dialogue and most of the bottom third of the screen.  Again, if you're not nit-picky like me, it won't matter that much, but again, there are better quality fan-subs floating around out there with far better subtitling.

  Also included in this set is a cd-soundtrack that I cannot tell whether the music came from an actual soundtrack release or if they were picked from a list of tracks from the movie and burned it to disc.  I will say that if you don't own Macross music that this is a good place to start.  The track titles are in Japanese text so unless you know a little of the language or, don't, the music is still great and unhindered by those technicalities.  It is a nice little extra to say the least.

  Here's the thing: if you're not a serious collector or don't care as much for this not being in it's purest form (being straight from Japan), then give this release a serious consideration.  It looks pretty close to a legitimate release and most people won't know the difference.  It seems un-cut (minus the original film company logo being blurred out), which, as a purist is important, and is a fairly good quality transfer even though there are better out there.  It does have a sloppy menu and large, unattractive subtitles, which is a big deterrent for me.  There is also the question if this is a actually a legitimate release or a very high-end fan-sub, but with the ""Macross Embargo"" we have here in the U.S., you're not going to find an official release at this price.  And, again, most people won't be able to tell the difference anyway, so if you don't mind a few nit-picky things here or there, this is one of the better releases I've seen.  At least the translation isn't in Engrish like some of the Chinese subs I unfortunately picked up.  You aren't getting a bad package at this price, but anything more than $20 is too much for this release.  Hopefully this helps the reader to make an wise purchase.

4592543,5,B0056KOCDA,"Anyone who is a fan of the original Robotech series needs to pick this one up. For the age of this film the animation is stellar and lush.

4592544,3,B0056KOCDA,"Let me start by saying I have no regrets with the purchase since this has, and probably never will have an official american release.

Now, obviously this is a bootleg, and given that, it's pretty darn good. The japanese audio and english subtitles are well done and the picture is crisp.

There is no official american dub, that parts a scam...and the english audio is god awful. I mean, people who speak broken english would be offended by it.

Overall, at the price and unavailability of an official release, this is a good buy for a darn good bootleg.",1361750400,,555,4.585858585858586
4592545,4,B0056KOCDA,"I bought this dvd/cd combo from an independent seller. It shipped quickly and was as described.

The dvd:  Picture quality and sound are excellent.

English dub:  Original - Awkward at times with some weird accents.

Japanese language/English or Spanish subtitles:  Fine except when Japanese subs appear underneath the English or Spanish subs making it difficult to read.  The Japanese subs appeared when the giant aliens were talking - I think because their speech, eventhough in Japanese, is highly distorted and the subs were meant to aid the original Japanese audience.  I keyed the subtitle menu to remove them but there is no way to.  So, I went back to watching the movie and when these double subs appeared, I just paused the movie and read carefully.  Slightly annoying, but part of the original film - I think.  This is the only reason why I gave a rating of 4 instead of 5 stars.

I do, however, strongly recommend this dvd.  This film is one of the anime classics and is such a good story. There is so much going on emotionally between the characters that, even today, rivals the best quality anime out there.  From a technical stand point, this film holds its own:  The colors are rich and beautiful, the movement fluid, the story's 'technology' is believable or nearly so.  But most of all, it's the message the movie brings: That no matter what, hope and love can and will survive - sentiments very refreshing in this day and age.  I suggest viewing the movie in the original Japanese dialogue with or without the English or Spanish subtitles - It adds much to the experience.

Warning:  There is brief nudity - Lynn Minmay floating about in a shower for a few seconds.  So be careful if you consider watching it with little Billy, little Susie, Grandma Jo, Aunt Edna or anyone else who may be suprised and/or offended!

The cd is excellent. The score is rich and beautiful, very nice to listen to while driving. There are only two Lynn Minmay songs included: The final battle song: ""Do You Remeber Love"" and a song played during the end credits. Both are very nice.",1361318400,2,2081,4.662087912087912
4592546,4,B0056KOCDA,"While this product is not endorsed by any ""official"" companies in the United States or Canada, this special edition from Crescent Media is probably as good as it's going to get for us until Harmony Gold and Studio Nu stop playing hardball with each other.  The film is presented in its original widescreen aspect ratio, and it has two audio options.  The first option is the original Japanese language track, in either Stereo or surround sound.  I'm not entirely sure, only, that Dolby was used.  It also comes with English subtitles, which are fairly accurate.  The second audio track is an English dub.  Unfortunately, this is nto the English fan dub found on YouTube, but instead is the original 1984 International dub commissioned by Toho, who distributed the film.  While some of the voices are recognizable from old action film dubs and many of the 1970's Godzilla movies, as well as the International dub of The Return of Godzilla (1984), the quality of the dub ranges from somewhat decent to hilariously awful.  the quality of th edub never stays consistent, and is constantly changing, depending on who is speaking and which voice actors are present in a particular scene or sequence.  The first disc also lacks a chapter or scene selection menu, but these can be accessed through the use of a remote control with the >>I or I<< buttons, or the display button, if your remote has one.  My DVD player from Pioneer has these, but Pioneer always did have more specialized products than mainstream companies, so I don't know how well other people may have that option.

The second disc in the set is something that many fans will salivate over: [dun dun dun] the original soundtrack for the movie.  This is a CD that has ther film's soundtrack, and it is exactly the same as the original release from Victor in Japan.  Unfortunately, this means that not only is Do You Remember Love placed in the middle of the disc and thus out of order, but that the version featured here is the five minute version, not the six and a half minute full version found on other compilation CDs, such as Minmay Sings For You, and Macross Song Special.  This also means that the CD lacks any of Minmays other vocal songs heard in the movie, such as Red Moon Silver Moon, My boyfriend is a Pilot (arguably the second most famous song in the franchise), and Little White Dragon.  Still, those complaints aside, the film's orchestral soundtrack, by Kentaro Haneda (Sayonara Jupiter, the original Macross series, and more), is an absolutely beautiful and evocative experience.  While a few pieces of his score for the TV series are reused, the main theme in this movie score is the new DYRL theme that he composed specifically for this movie, which is quite moving and romantic.  Unfortunately, again, several of the shorter tracks have been left off of this disc, just as they were on the Japanese release.  These excluded pieces include three short but lovely instrumental renditions of Do You Remember Love, Sad Space Soldier (or Wounded hero) (which plays when Roy Fokker dies -- he dies no matter what version of the story is being told, so spoilers don't count in his case), and a few others.  This is quite unfortunate, as the disc's runtime is within the forty minute range, meaning that several of those music pieces could have easily been included.  For this special edition release, this was a missed opportunity, but I suppose Cresecent Media didn't want to press their luck, what with Harmony Gold's embargo* on any Macross products being released in the states without their permission (despite the courts in Japan ruling that HG has no authority over any entries in the franchise other than the original TV series that they used for Robotech).

So, in conclusion, there were several things that this special edition could have done better, but to be honest, for an unofficial and probably unlicensed product, this special edition is far better than it has any right to be as well.  It isn't perfect, but until Animeigo convinces Harmony Gold and the other companies involved to let them release the film legally on DVD in the states, then I suppose that this special edition will have to suffice.

*Harmony Gold doesn't really have an actual embargo.  In reality, they sue and take to court any company that releases a product or entry in the franchise produced after Macross Plus.  Only Macross II and Macross Plus are currently legally available in the United States (and possibly Canada), in their original forms, courtesy of Manga Entertainment.  I believe that the manga adaptation of Macross Frontier may be legally available here as well, but I don't really know for sure.",1358294400,10,4675,4.8125

Art work was wonderful.  Robotech series was much better.  The art work was not as good.  There is no nudity and the story line translated is better.  Actors in Macross did not do the characters justice.  It was like they were just reading the script instead of acting.  Overall just okay.,1353974400,,461,4.592592592592593
4592549,5,B0056KOCDA,"Wow, this was an awesome buy.  You know how you wanted to see shows that you saw when you were a kid but then it became somewhat of a let down because it wasn't really how you remembered it.  They somehow seems so corny now but you swear that they were so much better back then.  Well, not this one.  This is exactly like how I remembered it and better since with the subtitle, I can now really understand it.

First of all, to qualify this review, I actually saw the Robotech series on TV in the US as a teenager, so it was from my era.  Then we heard of Macross the movie.  Within our group of friends, one happened to work at one of the AV stores in Japantown in San Francisco, so he was able to get a hold of a laser disc and copied it onto a VHS tape.  It wasn't perfect but we got to see and really enjoyed the movie.  Years later, I eventually got to see one with the subtitle but it was a VHS copy and still wasn't perfect.

Then I somehow came across this DVD on Amazon, it really piqued my interest so I decided to order it.  Anyhow, not expecting much, I popped it in my DVD player and sat back, thinking to myself that it will probably be another grainy copy and corny as usual.  Wow, was I in for a surprise.  It was perfect.  Everything was crystal clear, the subtitle was spot on, the music, the dialogue, the characters, even the karaoke sing along.  It was exactly how I remembered it and then some.

Afterwards, I decide to see what it was like dubbed in English, now that's corny and NOT they way I remembered it at all.  Hikaru with English accent?  Minmay sounds like an adult?  Everything was all wrong.  I recommend that if anyone buy this, you owe it to yourself to see it in the OST.  So much better than the dubbed version.

Oh, yeah, it also comes with the OST audio CDs.  Turns out that there are several versions and this is just another one of the few that's out there.  A friend got me another version from Japan many many years ago so that's how I know.

All in all a great buy for 25 bucks.  Much better than some of the crap that you see out there now.",1350518400,,2086,4.0763546798029555
4592550,5,B0056KOCDA,"A masterpiece of hand-drawn animation from 1984.  This was a superb, high-budget animation film retelling (today it would probably be called a reboot) of the original Macross TV series.  For many who are used to jerky, simple animation, this film is fluid, richly detailed, and lush with color.  I highly recommended it for the sheer beauty of the animation as well as an engaging story (although not as good as the original TV series).  Please note that it isn't for children, as the film does contain nudity (very brief) and violence.

It has both the Japanese and English dub, but the Japanese track has superior voice acting.  The English dub was a fairly simple effort made in Japan and fails to capture the emotion and pathos of the original.  The dialog is also a bit stilted.

The clarity of the DVD is not superb and looks as though it was made from old masters.  It may be worth considering the Blu-Ray version, if available.",1347408000,,935,4.652439024390244
4592551,5,B0056KOCDA,"This version of the movie, ""The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love, Perfect Edition"", released by Crescent Media, is really GREAT!!  It's wonderful that it's available again as there was a time not too long ago when you couldn't find a copy of this movie anywhere. The only way it could be better is if they were to digitally remaster it an put in on Blu-Ray.

Now as for what you get for the money, the movie set consists of the movie DVD and an audio CD that contains the soundtrack for the movie. The movie is in color, NTSC with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound tracks for both Japanese and English.

Getting to the movie itself, bear in mind that the movie version is considerably different from the Macross series itself as it is a film adaptation that is a re-imaging of the original series and contains new animation. So it doesn't really fit into the normal Macross timeline even though it relates the Macross' voyage back to earth from Pluto orbit. It was originally written as an alternate-universe retelling of the Macross story. Nevertheless it has become established as a part of the Macross universe.

So you will find some sharp differences in how the relationships between Hikaru, Minmay and Misa are handled as well as some differences in what happens to other major characters in the show. Given the compressed time frame, a lot of details on the relationships are left out. But in spite of that the characters and story line are fairly solid and believable in terms of their reactions and feelings. In fact I think the love stories are actually intensified because of the faster pacing and focused character development.

**SPOILER ALERT** In a way, I think this re-imaging or the original series is a good thing since one of the principal characters dies bravely and nobly for good purpose instead of dying needlessly and pointlessly, due to macho stupidity, as he does in the original series. There is also the revelation of one of earth's most ancient mysteries which is handled superbly. I won't say more so as not to spoil it further for those who haven't seen this movie yet. **END SPOILERS**

Another good point in my opinion is the way they handle the musical themes. I think it is superior to the original Macross series. In particular, unlike the original series, they did not play ""My Boyfriend Is A Pilot"" to death and they have a magnificent key song (Do You Remember Love - Ai, Oboete Imas Ka) sung by Lynn Minmay for the climactic final battle scenes whereas the original series has no principal song for the final battle sequence although the song, Love Flows, came close. You can also hear this signature song over the sounds of the battle which was not the case in the original series where the one song that could have been a signature piece is hacked to pieces by dialog and battle sounds. Also the story line of how the signature song, Do You Remember Love, in the movie is put together from two ancient sources is superb.

This version of the movie itself is really excellent. The images are razor sharp, and crystal clear with excellent color saturation and good detail even in the shadows. I viewed this with a Blu-Ray player that up converts regular DVDs and outputs the image via HDMI to a Hi-Def 65"" flat screen combined with a 7.1 audio system.

The sound tracks available are Dolby Digital English 5.1 and Dolby Digital Japanese 5.1. The audio quality of the Japanese track is excellent while the English track is somewhat poor. It sounds slightly muffled somehow and not as crisp and clear as the Japanese soundtrack.

After watching it in both Japanese and English dub, I've got to strongly recommend you go with the Japanese version with English subtitles. The Japanese audio version is definitely superior in audio quality compared to the English version, and the Japanese voice actors do a superb job of projecting the feelings and attitudes of the various characters.

The English dub cast, with the exception of the person playing Minn May's part (Mari Iijima), are really very poor. They sound like they are reading the script for the first time and don't really care about what they are doing or saying. Their performance is stilted, dull and bored. It also appears that both the English dub and subtitles don't always do a very good job of translating the Japanese in the English version. You'll note that in the English version there is a big difference between what the dub actors say versus what the subtitles say at the same time.

The English subs on the Japanese version though appear to be spot on.

All in all this is a terrific production of the movie version and should be a must have for your collection if you are a fan of Macross. The price is reasonable and the DVD is an ALL region DVD that should play in any player.

One other thing I should have mentioned is that this version of the movie has no extras on it BUT it does come with an audio CD of the movie soundtrack which includes the hit song, ""Do You Remember Love?"" (Ai Oboete Imasu Ka), which was sung by Lynn Minmay (Mari Iijima) at the height of the final battle. That alone makes it a must have in my book.",1347235200,,5153,4.618579234972677
4592552,3,B0056KOCDA,"As a foreign buyer, the opportunity to have a high quality product was unique to have this video available to so precious to my collection. The surprise was greater, and my big disappointment to see grammatical errors so serious that leads me to ask if the producer could make a review of the product before releasing it and so to find a product that for all its other features deserve to be called just ""good ""because it is far from excellent. The movie is a jewel of Japanese animation from the 80's. I think it deserves to be produced under such low quality standards. Errors: main menu prepared with static images of film posters, and the obvious annoyance of reading a subtitle so mediocre. The picture deserves an A (+), the rest, we'll see.

The Robotech series is watered down with cartoonish animation, subtle plot changes, and a complete re-edit to make it more palatable to young American viewers. This original, richly animated, and grittier Japanese version ruined me. The shoe horned Robotech series became unwatchable, as did the original Macross series with its now annoying theme songs, poor animation, terrible Minmay songs, repetitive backround music, and diluted content. This forced me to find a ""Super Dimension Fortress"" Japanese box set with English subtitles.
