Her insight and knowledge as well as pleasant personality make learning from her a learning experience for many people she touches through out 50 states and few countries,  she knows many different sign language, for example,  few states signs different than the other states like ""ASL ACCENT"".  She would die to learn much more daily to expose it on a DVD for everyone's learning experiences, skills and perspective.",1420502400,,442,5.183098591549296

8400786,5,B003N9BMTI,"As an author, teacher, ASL performing artist with my own company B.E.L.I.E.V.E., and as a freelance interpreter, I have found Trix and her workshops to be entertaining and educational; therefore having her on DVD is an added bonus.  I can watch and share with my students and those who attend my workshops.  Her insight and knowledge as well as pleasant personality make learning from her a joy.
I love everything I have seen in person and on DVD!
I recommend her and her resources!",1330992000,,482,4.726190476190476
8400787,3,B003N9BMTI,"I haven't seen this yet, and I don't know whether I will. I am definitely interested in the topic, but the options aren't adequate for me. It's presented in ASL, and it's voiced. I don't see anything about closed captioning or subtitles, and that's what I need for movies. I imagine there are a lot of people like me who don't fit into either the hearing or the deaf world completely and require subtitles for understanding. Is the deaf world the last to catch onto this? If so, it's rather ironic.",1329696000,2,498,4.483516483516484
