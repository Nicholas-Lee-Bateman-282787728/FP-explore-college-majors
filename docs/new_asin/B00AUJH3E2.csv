5510292,4,B00AUJH3E2,Good clean movie with a tough subject. Glad to see something from a child's point of view. Helps you see how life's situations affect children when adults don't realize it.,1388966400,2,172,4.766666666666667
5510293,1,B00AUJH3E2,"I really did not like this movie.  To say it was boring is giving it too much credit, so is giving it one star!",1388707200,,111,3.625
5510294,5,B00AUJH3E2,I thought the movie was well written. You could see the pain after losing the son. They were missing something and didn't know what it was. Really enjoyed watching!!,1387497600,,165,4.724137931034483
5510295,1,B00AUJH3E2,"This movie was AWFUL.  It did more to divert children from faith than to encourage it.  The preacher in the church scenes was mean, nasty and not in the spirit of love in any manner.  The churchgoers were depicted as ugly, old and made the boy vomit!  When the boy asks the angel, whom by the way is a dead ringer for Charlie MANSON, if he believes in God, the so called ""angel"" answers back with the typically atheist response of ""Do you believe in Santa Claus?!""  this movi was an outrageous blasphemy, and shatterer odpf belief, start to finish.  If you want to totally turn off your child to faith, shove this trash in his face!",1387238400,7,632,4.358974358974359
5510296,5,B00AUJH3E2,"I watch this movie with my grandkids and it was great. It started from questions from the grankids, about angels, and  heaven.",1386720000,,126,4.7272727272727275
5510297,5,B00AUJH3E2,"This is a heartwarming, small town, story. I love everything Corbin Bernsen does as a writer and actor. The film features Nathan Gamble (25 Hill, Dolphin Tale) and Lloyd Warner, a very interesting character actor (Rust). This is a wonderful film, we were please to share this work during our Christian film festival in our small town (Bedias, Texas, Christian Film Festival) and we fully reccomend this film for adults and children.",1386028800,5,432,5.013888888888889
5510298,1,B00AUJH3E2,"I do not consider this to be a Christian movie. 95% of the movie was detailing doubts about God, representing church as hell fire and damnation and the 5% ""resolution"" merely said to trust someone who rode a meteor into their town! The ""angel"" in his soft spoken voice said he believed in Santa Claus too which is THE approach that atheists use, not to believe in ""myths"". Seems like something atheists would want you to watch to CAUSE you to doubt. Horrible!",1384992000,13,459,4.542168674698795
5510299,4,B00AUJH3E2,The movie has great message and was fun to watch...aliitle slow at first but worth it to watch..enjoy the movie,1383523200,3,111,4.6
5510300,5,B00AUJH3E2,"A great film that challenges a person to remove the veil of their natural eyes and begin to see with their spiritual eyes the works and role of a Creator.  In this film the challenge is tossed from a child, his parents, even his Biology teacher.  Yet, it is all tied together by a special messenger, who appears to be a stranger to this small community.  Nonetheless, in its short-time, this film expands so much of what is known and at times taken for granted.  Its short-time, this film challenges logic and provides an incentive to explore that which fills in the void of the pattern of the grand design.  Watch the film, it will be worth it.  I recommend it.",1382313600,27,662,4.429752066115703

5510307,1,B00AUJH3E2,"Poor  acting.  The young star of the film may be a very fine future star but was given a role
very much out of character for a 13 year old child. His role would have been more
appropriate  for a 25 to 30 year old rather than a teenager.  Particularly disturbing was the
scene in which he  showed no respect for his mother, engaging in a violent argument.
The movie title was intriguing but disappointing in its content.",1426723200,,419,4.32051282051282

5510313,5,B00AUJH3E2,What a great family movie. We got this movie because the kids really liked Nathan Gamble from Dolphin Tail and wanted to see him in something else.  We like Corbin Bernsen from a lot of other shows and movies so this was a natural for us.,1406505600,,238,4.173913043478261
5510314,5,B00AUJH3E2,"I wouldn't have thought I would like this one as much as I did. So I watched it twice to be sure. I say that tongue and cheek but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The story was very unique in that it dealt with a child death that occurred some years before the boy in our story was born. He knows of his brother and what had happened to him as his parents hadn't kept anything from him. Because his brother just disappeared without a trace the parents try not to be to over bearing with him. Add a peculiar stranger in the mix that reads to a group of young people and you have the ingredients for a whole town of paranoid parents. As young Oliver asks some of life's big questions the mysterious Barlow is there to help him sort out what science has tried to answer. Why are we here and what happens when we die are a couple of the ""big"" questions, and you will have to watch ""Beyond the Heavens"" to understand the answers. You won't be disappointed.",1405296000,6,950,4.19672131147541

5510317,3,B00AUJH3E2,Beyond the Heavens was okay. It couldn't keep my attention for very long. I don't know what it was about this one. Great actors but maybe it's the story line.,1399334400,,158,4.3
5510318,1,B00AUJH3E2,"Film may have good intentions (""walk by faith, not by sight"") but story lines are undeveloped and lead nowhere.  Science vs. faith--argument was vague. ""Angel"" rides meteor into town, speaks with incomprehensible dialect, reads C.S. Lewis to kids--not Bible (probably not p.c.), confusing family situation...I found this film very poorly written and would not recommend it.",1395187200,6,373,5.660714285714286
5510319,5,B00AUJH3E2,It is a great movie that gives an example of a person's search for the truth . For the whole family to watch together.,1390608000,,118,3.9583333333333335
5510320,1,B00AUJH3E2,"I thought Nathan Gamble's acting was good as usual.  But other than that it was an awkward, contrived, and stretched thin plot line. There was no real point to it other than you can believe in God and science.  However, most religions condemn large parts of science, so I don't see the point that was trying to be made as anything other than pandering to people who see the church's views as outdated.

8557943,4,B00AUJH3E2,"This movie is intriguing. I wouldn't watch it with young children as the 13 year old struggles through a crisis of faith trying to determine is God real or is science the answer. It's the age old question really. There are some oddities in the movie. But overall it is engaging and encourages people in examining their ideaologies.

It does have some dramatic family scenes. But, given the context of the story, the family dynamics make sense. Even the boys ""disrespectful outburst"" at his parents is plausible given the families challenges and circumstances. I highly recommend this film.",1497484800,,589,5.010204081632653
