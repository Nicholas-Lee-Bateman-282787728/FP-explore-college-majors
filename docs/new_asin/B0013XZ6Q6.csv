8253610,5,B0013XZ6Q6,"Recently, we introduced my grandparents to the world of DVD's. As Spanish Speaking only individuals, I had been trying to get them Spanish Movies on DVD. They love all the Sarita Montiel movies from the 50's. They remember getting dressed up to go to the cinema in Cuba and the movies really take them back. These two for one DVD's are great and you really can't beat the price. It is a treasure trove I was thrilled to find for them on my quest to expand their DVD collection. They really take you back to a different time and let's face it, the classics never get old.",1231977600,4,570,4.336448598130841
8253611,5,B0013XZ6Q6,"The thin but charming plot concerns Manuel (The great Pedro Infante), who is an auto mechanic, and from his vantage point in the shop can see only legs walking by on the street. He falls in love with Maria Teresa's legs, and nicknames her ""Zapatitas."" One day he sees her legs on a bus, recognizes them immediately, and is afraid to look up at her face. When he finally sees her gorgeous beauty, he knows that she is the one for him, and follows her home. ""Necesito Dinero"" is the first of 3 films Infante made with Spanish singer/actress Sarita Montiel, a superstar in her own right. The mystery is that of the 6 songs included in the film, she doesn't sing a single note.

The humor in the film comes from Infante who tries to make money to impress Montiel, as she is determined to marry a rich man and get out of the poverty her family is living in. He tries singing in a television contest, competing in a boxing match, and more. At last there is the usual happy ending, as Montiel realizes her rich boyfriend is a skunk and that money isn't everything.

Written and directed by Manuel Zacarias, who was to direct the following 2 films with Infante and Montiel, with the wonderful ""Ahi Viene Martin Corona,"" and its sequel ""El Enamorado,"" both which gave Montiel ample singing opportunities. Zacarias also directed Infante in his 2 films with Argentine diva Libertad Lamarque, starting with the magnificent ""Ansiedad,"" and followed by ""Escuela de Musica.""

In ""Necesito Dinero,"" the terrific cast is rounded out by Irma Dorantes (of all of Infante's real-life loves, she was no doubt the most significant) as Montiel's younger sister Lucy, Armando Saenz, Elda Peralta, and Infante's brother Angel, as well as many other fine performers.

Music is written by Manuel Esperon and the 6 songs in the film are: ""Necesito Dinero,"" ""Anoche,"" ""Silbando Mambo,"" ""Las Tres Cosas,"" ""Amor Escondido,"" and ""Que Suerte la Mia.""

I have not seen the 1949 ""Pueblerina"" yet, but it is a film by Emilio Fernandez, starring Columba Dominguez, Aurelio Gonzalez, and Arturo Soto Rangel. It concerns the stuggles of a young farming couple with 2 heartless brothers, who are the landowners. Considering the cast and director, it must be very good!",1214611200,5,2247,4.828571428571428
