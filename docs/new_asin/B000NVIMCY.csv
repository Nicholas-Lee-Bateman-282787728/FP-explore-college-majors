8181772,3,B000NVIMCY,"First of all, it's not as violent as you might think. Headbutting is the main difference from what you are used to seeing in the US. No KOs or injuries occur with headbutts in this DVD. Just some cuts but no worse then cuts due to elbows in the UFC.

Second, The superfights are very good. Big names in their earlier days. Chuck has a great war with Pele!

Third, the only reason I don't give this a high rating is that many of the regular fights are average at best. The production values are low (think KOTC) and WARNING: there is no English, the DVD is all in Potugese (no big deal, I don't care what the commentators day).",1211587200,,626,4.208333333333333
8181773,3,B000NVIMCY,"It is nothing short of being viscious, to review a DVD and give out the results of the fights.  Who wants to buy an MMA event when they know who the winners are?

Liddell vs Pele was Awesome - that was in IVC 6.  However, that was not a tournament - unlike all the other IVC's and it was only 3 fights so I was dissappointed overall.
IVC 7 was a tournament, and although it did not reach the same intensity as earlier events, I would still recommend it.",1200960000,,453,4.067415730337078
8181774,4,B000NVIMCY,"Never knew Chuck competed in VTC in 1998. VTC, (Vale Tudo Championship) in Brazil. Bare knuckle & brutal. (They only pause the fight to wipe the blood off so the fighters can continue)! Pure guts. I bet that's when Chuck wanted a piece of Wanderlie way back then. I gave this 4 stars because it's enduring, but interesting. I would recommend this DVD to true MMA fans as part of a collector's item.",1185494400,2,398,4.465753424657534
8181775,5,B000NVIMCY,"It made me laugh when I heard Bill O'Reilly complaining about how brutal the current state-regulated MMA is, calling these fights ""showcases of brutality"". I guess he never saw the old Vale Tudo videos or even the old UFC. There are only two rules in Vale Tudo, no biting and no eyegouging, everything else is legal, including elbows, soccer kicks, stomps, and knees to the head of a grounded opponent, groin strikes, you name it. And they don't stop a fight because of a cut either. And they go one full 30 minute round. Lots of good fights, my only complaint being that some of them were dragged out a little too long, especially the Chuck Liddell x Pele fight. The Wanderlei x Van Arsdale fight was a relatively quick beatdown. Buy this DVD if you're a fan of old school no holds bar fighting, with MMA everywhere becoming a legitimized sport with rules and regulations, you might never be able to see stuff like this ever again.",1185408000,3,932,4.553571428571429
8181776,5,B000NVIMCY,This has Chuck in his Early days fighting against the legendary Pele.  Great fight nice striking and big win for the iceman.  Also on the dvd The Ax Murderer Wanderlei Silva shows his skills in dominating ufc veteran Mike van Arsdale.  If you enjoy mma this is worth adding to your collection.,1179619200,,293,4.596153846153846
