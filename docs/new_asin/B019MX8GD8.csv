8745512,5,B019MX8GD8,"Yes,a very exciting Bruckner performance by the best Bruckner conductor. I have heard this symphony many times in concert halls and on cd. But in this performance I have discovered some new things, which I have never heard before. He has a lot of attention to detail. It's nice that now symphonies 3-9 by Christian Thielemann are available. So, we have only to wait for the first 2 symphonies.",1501286400,2,393,4.7101449275362315
8745513,5,B019MX8GD8,"Excellent!  Beatiful and meditative rendering of the last symphony of the Master. Of the ""major"" symphonies of Bruckner with Thielemann and Dresden we lack the 6th only.",1484265600,3,169,5.2592592592592595
