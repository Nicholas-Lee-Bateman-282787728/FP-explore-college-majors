8725311,2,B0124KXZ1O,"Love (Lauren Walsh) is a stripper/escort and Ned (Jason Mewes), a customer, loves her. Love is ready to leave and run off with Ned but is coerced into doing one last house. Here the three escorts meet Hate (Ezra Buzzington) a man introduced earlier spouting religious theology and we know he is sadistic and evil. The main plot intersects with flashbacks and flash forwards, clearly an editor on drugs, assuming they had one. The soundtrack was pretty decent. The twist/plot was slightly different. I was confused by the Felissa Rose walk-on. Did we need that?

8725312,5,B0124KXZ1O,"I liked it. It's bizarre. Non-linear. Kinky. Thought provoking. More of a love story with horrific twists than a horror film. But definitely worth the viewing, I thought.",1451433600,3,170,5.107142857142857
8725313,1,B0124KXZ1O,"The movie takes a literal 45 minutes before it even begins to address a semblance of a story. For the most part, it's just boring. the humor falls flat most of the time and it really doesn't build up to anything compelling or really horrific (as one would assume from the synopsis). Even the title is bad and doesn't really reflect the actual content of the narrative.

They pulled in some old-school horror talent (which they even advertise on the front cover by way of Felissa Rose), but herein, they do next to nothing interesting. Worse, Felissa Rose only makes an appearance at the very beginning, is on camera for about one minute and is presumably killed off camera. Advertising at its finest...

Mostly, the film is a ""mind game"" between a prostitute and an ""evil"" dude. And I say that lightly as the writing thinks it's smarter than it really is when it's actually just eye-rolling. For a large chunk of the flick, it's just those two being snide with one another. One will say something in a seductive manner and the other will reply with a jab of sarcasm. Fun.",1450483200,2,1071,4.572916666666667
