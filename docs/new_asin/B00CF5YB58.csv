5720971,2,B00CF5YB58,"There may be some helpful information in here, but one has to listen to a monotone teacher for a long time to finally get to a point when she gives a nugget of wisdom. The format in which it is taught is highly disappointing. The teacher stands right in front of the camera the entire time and doesn't move. She talks for (literally) hours without music, a change of scenery, or even a change in the position of the camera. I would not recommend this series to anyone.",1383868800,12,468,4.329545454545454
5720972,5,B00CF5YB58,"Finally there is a detailed, cohesive product that explains and teaches the work of Dr. Buteyko. This 5 disc DVD set makes it very easy for you to start learning and applying Breathing Normalization on your own. Even though there is a lot of lecture material, it is broken down into small readily accessible chapters making it easy for you to start and stop as often as needed without having to search for where you left off. There are also detailed breathing exercise demonstrations at the end of each disc for easy reference when needed. This DVD set is not only great for those new to method, but also for those that want a ""refresher"" course to ensure they are applying the method properly. Of course this DVD set is not a replacement for working one on one with a practitioner, as Dr. Buteyko himself pointed out as being the best way to learn, but it is the next best thing!",1366416000,5,880,4.472049689440993
5720973,5,B00CF5YB58,"The Breathing Normalization 5 DVD set is a wonderful introduction to Breathing Normalization.  Sasha Yakevlova Fredricksen really understands the material and presents it in a way that is easy to understand and apply. The series contains a wealth of information and it really helps you to get really aware of your breathing in every moment.

In the series Sasha goes behind the actual how to's and reveals Dr. Buteyko's breakthrough, his thinking, and philosophy. It is truly amazing to learn that almost everyone is actually overbreathing, and it can have really negative health consequences. In the Breathing Normalization DVD series, you will learn how to use your breath to take back control of your health and wellbeing, as well as how to monitor HOW things effect your breathing, so that you can make better and more conscious choices.  Through applying the techniques and knowledge that I learned, I have naturally been making more healthy lifestyle choices, and have as a result lost about 10 pounds.

Breathing is such so foundational that changing your breathing can lead to changes in many areas of your life. It takes mindfulness to a whole new level! It is a multitasker's dream, imagine being more mindful as you do all of your daily activities. By noticing your breath and doing the simple and enjoyable exercises, you can transform your health and reduce stress. You may not want to stop there, and luckily, Breathing Center offers individual one-to-one and family classes, too. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be truly healthy. It will be one of the best investments you can make in your health or the health of those you love.",1366329600,10,1659,4.935483870967742

Sasha, the presenter, has a friendly and watchable style, and she explains the concepts in language that makes it very easy to understand and implement. I felt the pace was perfect, and the order in which the concepts were taught made good sense.

8581174,4,B00CF5YB58,I purchased set 5 dvd soft copies The Breathing Normalisation about 1.5 months back. It is a great resource. It is helping me to learn Dr Buteykos' breathing normalisation method of my own. I am progressing well. Book breath to heal is also an excellent support material to learn breathing normalistion of my own.,1487203200,,313,4.814814814814815
8581175,4,B00CF5YB58,"I found the breathing normalization method while searching the web for an answer to my breathing issues. I have had asthma my whole life (I'm 46 now) and one day started having trouble getting a deep, refreshing breath. I went to my Allergist and she tried switching my inhaler (several times), but it made no difference. This symptom caused me such anxiety and I had no idea why it was happening.

After watching several of the DVD sessions I started practicing nasal breathing and it was miraculous! I realized I am a mouth breather and based on the research/science this can cause some people to hyperventilate without knowing it. The DVD's are a outdated and a challenge to watch, as Sasha is a very slow talker and looks up a lot, which is odd (but is explained in one of the sessions), so I had to be ultra-patient. BUT, it worked, and that's what really matters to me!

Would you believe that after I learned breathing normalization I noticed a friend of mine yawning and I asked if he was tired, and he said ""no, I've had this for 30 years, I just feel like I need a deep breath but no matter how much I yawn it's never enough"". I told him about the Buteyko site and briefly explained nasal breathing. He said he'd give it a try, but I don't know yet if it worked for him (I'm sure it did).

While I'm not into the Eastern  philosophy (chanting, meditating, etc.), this program really truly helped me, so thank you!!!!",1487203200,2,1426,4.431297709923665
8581176,5,B00CF5YB58,The presenter is Russian ( which makes send for a Russian technique ) . She has a slight accent yet after a few minutes it was quite easy to understand. She is extremely knowledgable and extremely informative. I have seen many of the other products on the market and this is the most beneficial product I have found. I followed the step by step instructions of the DVDS and the results are amazing. May asthma attacks have stopped; I no longer need a rescue inhaler and I feel the best I have felt in years.,1465689600,,507,4.347368421052631
