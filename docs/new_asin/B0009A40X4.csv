2274207,3,B0009A40X4,"The version that I watched had a different cover design, but since this one is priced $2.99 I'm assuming that it's the same or similar.  An interesting movie.  Basically Sheen is an architect that has kids in private school and a wife who expects a certain lifestyle, but has run into financial difficulty due to employment issues.  After being ""hired"" by a man planning a ""perfect"" bank heist to provide technical advice on a neighbouring building, Sheen is informed about the plan and, with some reluctance, eventually becomes further involved.  Perhaps not the most well-acted movie of its kind, I guess the biggest fault (with the edition I viewed, at least) really is the image quality.",1216339200,5,691,4.931034482758621
2274208,2,B0009A40X4,"I bought this item because of the cast, and it is admittedly a pleasure to watch them in performance.  But there are too many excellent heist movies and TV series out there (the two ITALIAN JOBs, THE STING, $ with Warren Beatty, even a near-noir morality tale from the pre-Code Thirties called THE WRONG ROAD, and such box sets as MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and HUSTLE) that this one can't compete.  It's not only slow, but slow in sewer full of liquid offal--not the most pleasant place to spend one's movietime.",1187654400,,505,4.662921348314606
2274209,5,B0009A40X4,"A thoroughgoing plan toward husking London's largest and most secure holding bank of the contents of its safety deposit boxes, a quite improbable venture, is basis for action in this nicely finished film that successfully and consistently features valuable understatement in its script.  American architect Stephen Booker (Martin Sheen), working and residing in England and married to an English woman (Susannah York), is facing a depressing future after an important contract for which he and his partner have bid is awarded to a competing contestant, leaving Booker's firm essentially fundless and paving the way for what will not be a standardized adventure film.  The newly unemployed architect's efforts to find a new position are unsuccessful, as he is repeatedly reminded by those with oversight of the jobs for which he is applying that he is ""overqualified"", until he is of a sudden hired by one Mike Daniels (Albert Finney) to design a conversion of an entire city block, an assignment that will serve to elide Stephen's rampant personal debts to his banker, played incisively by Robert Morley.  However, after Stephen has discovered from documents while developing plans for the project that Daniels, his new boss, is an apparent mountebank, he resigns from his new position, thereby being forced to encounter his ambitious wife's spleen, in addition to that of his banker, so that when Daniels, a proficient safebreaker, urges Booker to rejoin him as part of a carefully selected crew of criminal specialists organized for the bank breakin, Stephen decides that becoming a temporary accomplice is less intolerable than becoming increasingly destitute.  And so, into mid-town London's rat infested sewer tunnels goes the skilled team of burglars toward their targeted vault (actually filmed within the Unilever Building upon the north side of Blackfriars Bridge), but their carefully devised heist, that will incidentally free Stephen Booker from his monetary obligations, is fraught with unforeseen complications, realistically presented here by cast and crew.  Direction is excellent, focussing upon convincing detail supplied by a well-written screenplay that avoids turgid psychodrama in favour of the mechanics of a scheme that becomes of compelling interest to a viewer who will additionally find the characters of interest simply because their innermost thoughts are not voiced, and the intriguing possibilities suggested by the climax are stimulative.  Finney handily earns the acting laurels, dominating his scenes with an engaging performance as an actuating criminal specialist, and there is fine playing by all members of the talented cast, quite synchronous to the refinements soaked throughout the script, with markedly solid turns from Colin Blakely and Alfred Lynch as two of Daniels' henchmen.  The superb editing of Ralph Sheldon serves to intensify this well-crafted affair, not distributed within the United Kingdom, and it is salted with the valuable contributions tendered by Michael Reed and his camera, Maurice Cain for always appropriate designing, and Ian Wingrove for the special visual effects, in particular when the sewer exit route to be used by the thieves is flooded following an unforecast downpour.",1130889600,5,3244,5.488977955911824

8058652,5,B0009A40X4,"Okay, fine. It's a neat little movie. What if there are SMART crooks out there? I bet there are. You know ... the one who don't get caught. I wrote a paper on this subject a long time ago in which I posited the general setup ( as far as a fictional story, or a serious long range plan ) that there are usually two or three members of a crew that are not beset by addiction, stupidity, brutality, greed, or insanity, while there is usually one or two that are who upset the applecart by their own faults. Thomas Crown Affair comes to mind, but in a more practical sense; what if? What if the guys weren't plagued by personal problems to the degree that it wrecks their criminal life?
  I recommend this movie on that basis, and also because it isn't the popular over contrived and complicated storyline that seems so prevalent today K.I.S.S.",1456099200,,840,4.378205128205129

Martin Sheen plays an out of work Architect, who is desperate to make some money!

So forms an unlikely partnership, and a viable loophole which provides a new start for our Architect and his wife!
The story line is not unique, but it contains twists and turns which provide an interesting journey.
And the closing is unique!",1348876800,,501,5.423076923076923
8058658,3,B0009A40X4,"Par for the course heist flick that's reasonably entertaining.

Architect and structural engineer Stephen Booker, played by Sheen, lives as an American expat in London. Unfortunately, his business has taken a bad hit. And after losing a desperately needed contract, the firm is finished. Worse, the bank has flatly stated they will no longer fund his extravagant lifestyle by extending any further credit. He's desperate - and that smell carries very far.

Along comes gentleman thief Mike Daniels, played by Albert Finney with his usual understated aplomb.

And Mr. Daniels has an offer.

So begins the seduction of Stephen into the underworld - and the biggest bank job in the history of the UK.

Interestingly, I'm no longer used to straight old school heist flicks like this one. Having been indoctrinated into ""the twist"", I don't sit back with a full commitment to the job, if you will. Like waiting for a sucker punch to the arm, I'm always holding back in anticipation of the takedowns which have the compulsory last-second curveball. So this was, in itself, a twist that played straight. So to speak. <g>

A reasonably okay early 80's flick whose refreshed dvd artwork from 2005 is cleverly inaccurate and stylish deceitful.",1333152000,,1233,5.019607843137255
8058659,5,B0009A40X4,"Martin Sheen is an architect in London, somewhat of a fish out of water. He's out of work and desperate to make quick cash, and certainly not above stealing to do it. That's when Albert Finney enters and offers Sheen a job as a ""Straight Man"" for a bank heist. A very British bank heist, with frequent breaks for tea time. Nevertheless, Sheen agrees to help Finney bust into the most impenetrable vault in all of London. Will they succeed and keep the loot? Will Scotland Yard catch them in the act and/or during tea time?! The clock is ticking, and Sheen's Disco collar is going out of style fast. (Not to mention Finney's coke addiction.)

Loophole is wonderful, and the viewer will learn just what the ""loophole"" really is only while watching the film. They will also learn that the film's score seems more fitting for a Sci Fi classic than this most British of crime thrillers. Perhaps it was cheaper, we assume that the director meant to pay MICHAELmATICIAN to provide the sound pieces. But you must know: 1982 wouldn't allow it. (The film's score was provided by Tartley Sangham.)

Copyright law prevents us from knowing what year the film was released. Perhaps PIPA will change that.
