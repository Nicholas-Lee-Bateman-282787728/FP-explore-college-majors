8087402,1,B000BJGJTQ,"The DVD was only $10, so really not worth the effort to return (and only a partial refund is given if the DVD is opened anyway.)  However, I thought the quality was so poor, that other consumers should be warned.

The production quality and scripting was very awkward...even for an instructional-style video.  The majority of the ""acting"" was so poor, it was uncomfortable to watch.  And the content regarding actual etiquette recommendations/instruction amounted to a very small portion of the video.  Most of the dialogue was dedicated to telling us the many reasons ""why"" we (specifically directed to females) should have etiquette.

If someone is buying an etiquette video, they are most likely interested in learning actual etiquette or protocol and don't need to be convinced as to why.  The content was just really missing the mark, in my opinion.",1213574400,7,854,5.057142857142857
