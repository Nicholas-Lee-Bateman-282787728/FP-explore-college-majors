4062732,3,B00330901Y,"This would be a good workout if I could remember the steps. He he. You learn real choreography and it isn't exactly easy. You have to put alot of effort into learning the steps and then it would be a good workout.
Not for someone looking for an aerobics type workout.",1285632000,2,267,4.254901960784314
4062733,4,B00330901Y,"This video isn't really for the person with ""two left feet"". It is a great dance video, although you need room in your home to do the moves full out. Even learning the steps, though, I worked up a good sweat. Its fun, dancy, and I love Kerrington (she was my favorite on SYTYCD and in the movie) so I really enjoy this video. Its great for a change in workout, and to me, doesn't even feel like a workout, feels more like the dance classes I take and its over just like that and you can't believe you just worked out for an hour. Have fun with it.",1281916800,14,547,4.027522935779817
4062734,3,B00330901Y,"This shows some cool, fun moves which you could apply to other workouts or dances. But as an actual workout video it's not very good. The first section is fun, then the other two get very fast and more difficult. And you can't just play the whole thing once you've learned it. You have to go through the steps again or fast forward to the end. So it's not a very convenient workout and you'd have to do it several times if you want any results.",1281398400,3,444,4.174418604651163
4062735,5,B00330901Y,"The soundtrack has music with singing, including the ""Fame"" remake theme song.

The dancing is by talented, professional dancers.

There are three instructors and six other dancers.

Colleen Craig is one of the other dancers.  She's great.",1270684800,,239,5.378378378378378
8387729,4,B00330901Y,"This is more a ""learn a dance routine"" than an actual workout dvd. It also requires a lot of floor space AND skill level. If you are like me and can't point your toes, don't buy it. :)",1492905600,2,184,3.8684210526315788
8387730,5,B00330901Y,Love it! As a former dancer I find this workout is excellent for those who have studied dance as well.. It was so easy to learn the routines. I do them practically everyday!,1420243200,,173,4.2727272727272725
8387731,1,B00330901Y,"I can't even get the thing to play, it keeps saying wrong region!!!!! What am I supposed to do as not possible to send back.....",1395187200,,128,4.16
8387732,4,B00330901Y,No complaints. It is exactly as advertised. Only wish it was done a little more like and introduction to dance.,1386806400,,111,4.6
8387733,2,B00330901Y,"I tried the Fame Dance Workout thinking it would be dance-based cardio, rather than serious choreography, and was disappointed that it was the latter.

Fans of the movie might enjoy the actors leading the workout segments, but while these three kids are good dancers, they are FAR from experienced fitness instructors, and that shows in their cueing: they use a lot terminology that would be unfamiliar to anyone who isn't also a dancer, and give very few useful directions.  (Kristy, who does the African dance, is probably the LEAST bad.)  They also stop and start a lot, which makes it difficult to establish flow.

The one strength of this DVD is that if you can actually do the moves, it's decent exercise.  I was able to follow along enough to burn some calories, but compared to alternatives like Debra Bono's African Dance series, CRUNCH Carido Salsa, Zumba, and the like, it's FRUSTRATING and lacks continuity.

Bottom line: I do not recommend the Fame Dance Workout.  :(",1334707200,,980,4.867469879518072
8387734,2,B00330901Y,"Three things you will need to enjoy this video:

1. A large dance studio for a living room
2. Years of dance experience
3. The ability to learn a routine after seeing it only a few times

I have none of the above so I could not enjoy this video. The routines have people moving around a large space and traveling across the room. It's impossible to do in a average-sized living room. The ""teachers"" break down the routines into pieces, but only show a piece twice before they move on to the next. QUICK! I thought I would be able to learn it after watching repeatedly and rewinding, but I got frustrated and never used it again. They should market this to experienced dancers.",1325030400,3,676,4.4
8387735,4,B00330901Y,"This DVD fulfilled my desires to be in a dance class again. If you are used to dancing, this will be an appropriate level of learning. If you are completely inexperienced in dance, I wouldn't highly recommend this workout DVD. The combinations are fun, and you learn about eight counts at a time. The only complaint I have is that the choreography requires a bigger space to fully dance it out, so clear the room if you want to have the best experience.",1307664000,5,453,4.469879518072289
8387736,4,B00330901Y,"This DVD is not really a workout vid.  Instead it is great practice for trained dancers.  I purchased this DVD for my daughter, who has been dancing for 12 years, as extra practice to her three weekly dance classes.  She is interested in including more modern, jazz and lyrical moves to her practice(which is mostly ballet).  She loved it and found it challenging and interesting.

I workout 5-6 days per week, and did not find it to my liking as a fitness practice because I am not a trained dancer.  The pacing is simply too difficult and I am not familiar with the dance ""terms"" that are often used throughout the DVD.  I can understand why so many ppl rated it poorly, especially if they do not have dance background.  This product would definately be too frustrating for basic fitness needs.

It should be known that some of the instructors are better than others.  Kherington is awesome.",1292025600,8,893,4.630573248407643
8387737,1,B00330901Y,"This was so a poor made dvd, I swear the video trailer for it was better then the actually dvd itself. the dance moves were horrible, I would not recommend this to no one.",1288051200,,171,4.0588235294117645
8387738,1,B00330901Y,"The Fame dance workout was never delivered.  After 2 weeks I inquired--Amazon refunded my money and the store couldn't understand why it was never delivered.  I am disappointed it wasn't delivered, but appreciate prompt refund.",1286409600,,227,5.457142857142857
