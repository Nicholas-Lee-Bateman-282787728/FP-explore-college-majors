947632,4,6304993722,"Kenneth Branagh is a divorced Savannah lawyer, who is attracted to a waitress in an office party. By going over to her house, he gets more than some casual sex. He immediatelly involves himself in defending her from her unstable father, and goes in over his head because things are not as they seem.
The movie, acting, and plot are great, and are very impressive on the first watching. But after watching it for the first time, once you know all the plot twists, you can watch the movie a few more times to get some more depth before it gets boring and predictable... So you might give buying this DVD (instead of renting it out) another thought...",1008892800,6,648,4.5
947633,5,6304993722,"alright, i've read some of the reviews and i have to disagree with most of the comments. i came into this movie, thinking it wouldn't be all that good, but i was blown away! i mean i admit it was SORT OF a drag @ FIRST...but then it REALLY sped up! i mean, who woulda thought that it would twist the way it did i didn't suspect what would happen til the very end. seeing as to embeth davidtz is british, her accent was FABULOUS!!! i can't say anything about the accents being STRAIGHT on, cuz i mean i'm not a dialect coach or anything, but they sounded good to me. no one said anything about necessity as far as the accents and the rain go. the rain added for complications in the end...like the whole cell phone bit (he woulda heard the cell on the phone if the rain hadn't been comin' down and wind blowin' so hard...plus the accents add flavor to the story. it's like, what's the point of making ppl speak with british dialects when they're in london, ya know what i mean?!  okay, kenneth branagh, best known for his wonderful adaptations of shakespeare...did a REALLY good job in something different for him. i liked his performance a lot. daryll hannah...she was fabulous as alwayz...she seems to alwayz do the best with her characters. she's definately a favorite of mine. famke janssen...needs to do more work...good of course, but not enough in this to see her actual acting potential. robert duvall...pyscho no shoe man...hehehe....it would be interesting to see him in more psychotic roles, don't you all think?! robert downey jr....last but not least. i have to say he's a personal fave of mine...alwayz has been. he has a way with roles...where he would make an otherwise boring lifeless role and bring it to life. as an aspiring actress myself...it does me well to watch and learn. he did that with his character. i mean, you could SOOO tell he was a drunk! and i mean he didn't walk funny or anything like that, but you could tell...it was good.  ~anywayz~ all in all good movie. it occasionally comes on usa, i would catch it if you can. i really liked it! :)",994550400,,2075,4.50132625994695

Branagh gives a wonderful  performance as a great lawyer who was a so-so husband and becomes a good  father through the course of the movie.  There isn't a pretentious moment  in it.

947637,4,6304993722,"THE GINGERBREAD MAN is a very good movie, one of the best of Robert Altman's fluctuent career. The big question was : How an independent filmmaker such as Altman would cope with a John Grisham script ? No problem  at all, in fact. I don't know from which one came the idea to create a  fairy tale world around a southern lawyer story, but it was a great idea.  So we have a lawyer which drives a red car and goes by night in a forest to  find a very mean ogre who doesn't wear shoes. Doesn't this story remind you  something ? You can have fun to count how many tales's plots Altman and  Grisham have used in this story. Believe me or not, there are a lot of  them.

947753,2,6304993722,"I think my only response to this movie is: was it necessary?  Altman ads nothing to the genre and we've all already seen this movie before.  I don't think he had anything to say about any of the standard noir elements.  It was just the usual stuff noir is made of, i.e. the lying, duplicitous woman, the stupid libido-driven private dick (or in this case, lawyer) who thinks he knows what's happening but doesn't until it's too late.  I'm really tired of the Altman overlapping dialogue and those cheesy zooms to some object meant as a clue which he's been doing his whole career and it always looks artificial and not at all organic like, say, Kubrick's tracking shots.  I always hear how underated Altman is but I think he's long been a stoner with a camera.  Not nuts about his shot composition and there's something muddy and flat about the look of the film.

I suppose the acting is serviceable but in no way impressive. On the whole I found it quite a bore.

947756,4,6304993722,"THE GINGERBREAD MAN is a curious film. It has a very good premise and surreptitious storyline. However, there are a few things that keep this film from being something much greater.

After recently viewing it again, I now see that Kenneth Branagh, the main character, is actually unsympathetic and not all that bright. I think his character is just not clearly defined. He really is a blatant womanizer, but unfortunately that point is not strongly conveyed to the viewer. If it were, that would explain a lot of his behavior and the very poor judgment that he uses for such a high powered attorney that he is playing. He essentially falls for a woman, the wrong woman. That is a key plot point that is never reinforced and it is an essential one. Another, point that I see more clearly now is the credibility of some of the events. For a realistic looking film, these are blatantly obvious. How could a bunch of old vagrants and alcoholics break into a mental institution and rescue their buddy played by Robert Duval? How could someone fire a flare gun in a furious hurricane with driving winds and torrential rain from about 40 feet away and hit a man square in the back and kill him? These elements defy all credibility especially considering the tone of this film.

I very much liked this film the first time I saw it and there is a lot to recommend. The plot truly is intriguing and there are many twists and turns. The actors and there performances are very good especially those of Kenneth Branagh, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall.",1402272000,2,1552,4.619565217391305

thriller/mystery), that's much more successful on it's own terms.

The acting is very good throughout. It may be my favorite Kenneth
Branagh performance; understated and subtle. And a number of the scenes
really are tense. Altman finds some clever ways to create suspense with
sound and image that aren't just retreads of what we've seen before.

logic sometimes questionable, and the moral POV of the film is a bit

That said, this particular movie was a pleasant surprise.  I am a huge fan of Branagh's work, but the only other non-Shakespeare film I'd seen of his was ""Dead Again"" (which I also highly recommend!).  I think that he carried off the role of Rick Magruder very well, accent and all.  Was the accent perfect?  Probably not... particularly to those from the South.  But it was spoken well enough, and Branagh's ""character presence"" was enough to make any slips either unapparent or forgivable.  The entire cast did a spectacular job of bringing the characters to life and bringing them together in a believable manner.

I live in central east Georgia, and it has been my misfortune to spend quite a lot of time in the company of Savannah lawyers; Kenneth Branagh's character in this movie could have slipped into one of those practices like hair into hair oil.  The look, the walk, the gestures, the speech - all of it seemed to me perfect.  I am not native to Georgia, it's true, but I've lived here for 6 years, and usually accents bother me.  Branagh's art  - his ear, his technique - is something special.

So, if you're interested in him, or in mimicry in general, you will get something out of this over-all low-grade film.",1143417600,24,795,4.337837837837838

947873,3,6304993722,"THE GINGERBREAD MAN is based on an original screenplay by legal novelist John Grisham and directed by Oscar nominated Robert Altman, featuring a cast of reputable actors.  The main problem is that the plot's so-called twist is obvious from the moment Mallory steals an ashtray from Rick Magruder's office and her car is ""conveniently stolen.""  From thereon, the plot moves a little too slowly towards a not wholly satisfying denouement.  Along the way, we're treated to some interesting, althought not spectacular, acting.  Kenneth Branagh does his Southern accent dutifully well for a Brit, but his performance is too hammy at times to be convincing; Embeth Davidtz as Mallory invokes little sympathy because the discerning viewer knows there's more than meets the eye; Darryl Hannah is hardly recognizable as Lois, an associate of Branagh, whose main function seems more clerical than legal; Tom Berenger shows up as Davidtz's ex-husband, whose mere presence in a seemingly incidental role is in itself a plot give-away; Robert Downey Jr. appears as Clyde, Branagh's private investigator who is a hopeless alcoholic; and Robert Duvall, looking foolish in a baldpate and long hair, has an enigmatic but pivotal role as Davidtz's eccentric if not looney father.

Never being one of Altman's greatest fans, I can commend him on trying to add a different touch to a rather familiar formula, including the relentless rain during Hurricane Geraldo.  But ultimately, THE GINGERBREAD MAN comes out half-baked and unfulfilling, wasting a lot of Oscar caliber talent.",1104883200,5,1559,5.291497975708502
947874,4,6304993722,"Rick Magruder (Kenneth Branagh), a rather arrogant, womanizing lawyer in Savannah, Georgia, has just won a big case against some allegedly overzealous cops. Which is jolly good for his career, unless of course he should develop the sort of problems in life where having the local police hate you might prove a handicap. Which is exactly what he goes and does. A casual sexual entanglement with Mallory Doss (Embeth Davidtz) gets him involved professionally in a conflict with her father (Robert Duvall) who appears to be stalking her. Then when the latter escapes from a psychiatric hospital things start to get complicated. And nothing, it will turn out, is quite what it seems.

Robert Altman, of course, just doesn't do mainstream, run of the mill Hollywood movies. Which makes this an intriguing project for him as what could be more mainstream, run of the mill Hollywood than a hot and sweaty Southern-based legal thriller from a John Grisham story? The result is certainly interesting, though not helped by the casting of one of my least favourite actors, the consistently lacklustre Kenneth Branagh, in the lead role. On the plus side, the cinematography by Changwei Gu (who had earlier shot`Red Sorghum' and `Farewell My Concubine') is superb and the long opening shot of the Savannah River is altogether breathtaking.

The film as a whole is certainly well worth a look: dark, shadowy, intriguing and twisty but somehow less than wholly satisfying. Here everything depends on your choice of comparison class. As Grisham adaptations go, it's brilliant, surely the best. As Altman movies go it's only so-so.",1103500800,6,1614,5.086792452830188
947875,2,6304993722,"The Gingerbread Man should be a better noir than it is.  A primary flaw is its inability to get us behind its protagonist in any way- Rick MacGruder (Kenneth Branagh) is pompous, vain, and tempestuous.  As an attorney, he is the polar opposite of Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch, willing to sink to any level in order to win a case.  When MacGruder helps a young woman deal with her mentally unstable father, we know he is doing so out of a desire to get in her pants rather than any sort of altruism.  It is simply hard to care for him as his situation deteriorates- indeed, one almost gets the feeling that karma is simply at work.
Another issue is the plot.  While twists and turns are fine, this film saves all of them for the final thirty minutes, and they feel a little overwhelming.  While you are trying to figure out how one twist happened, the next one barrels onto the screen.
Stylistically, the film has some interesting and cool moments.  The slick opening shot, accompanied by the discordant score, takes us over the Georgia coastal plain and eventually tracks MacGruder's car over the Talmadge Bridge and into Savannah.  It hardly matters that traveling from Jacksonville to Savannah (as we are told) doesn't take you over said bridge.  The setting is an important part of the story, and Savannah is a location that never fails to lend its uniqueness to a film.
On the whole, The Gingerbread Man has some genuinely suspenseful moments (Duvall is particularly menacing) but it is otherwise disengaging.  I was waiting for it to end.",1089936000,8,1543,4.681481481481481
947876,4,6304993722,"I can remember seeing this movie in an almost empty theater when it came out. It's a shame because this is really a well-made, intriguing thriller that only Robert Altman could make. Rumour has it, he completely demolished John Grisham's original story and basically did his own thing--which is what Altman is famous for. The results? An unusual mystery that gets under your skin with characters that are flawed and always interesting to watch.
Much was made about Kenneth Branagh's Southern accent... or lack thereof. To tell you the truth, it really didn't bother me all that much and I think he pulled it off. He certainly is a flawed character, vain, self-absorbed but through the course of the movie he certainly learns his lesson as his whole world gets tossed upside down.
This movie really is about human behaviour as opposed to a concrete A to B to C linear plot. The mystery is really just window dressing to get all of these characters together and see what happens.
As always, Altman has assembled a top notch cast with the likes of Daryl Hannah (?!) and Tom Berenger plucked out of obscurity for solid performances. Robert Duvall also turns up as a crazed hobo character. He makes the most of his limited screen time. And of course, good ol' reliable Robert Downey, Jr. turns in another wonderfully eccentric turn as a slightly-sleazy private detective who's buddies with Branagh's character. He steals every scene that he's in.
The DVD is quite good. The audio and video is excellent. As another reviewer pointed out, if you have a surround sound set-up it feels like the tropical storm in the movie is all around you. Altman really knows how to build atmosphere and suggest a specific place.
This is a really good movie. Very underrated and worth a look.",1084492800,49,1769,4.765472312703583
947877,4,6304993722,"I just got done watching this movie, and I'm a bit torn on which side of the discussion I'm going to come down on.

I was curious to see how Branagh (whom I generally love as an actor) was going to do a Southern accent.  I think he struggled on this.  He did an OK accent, but being a Northerner, I'm going to have to defer on others on how good his accent was.  At least he didn't have a broad drawl.

The plot was pretty suspenseful.  One did feel a definite sense of foreboding when Branagh's children were involved.  Unlike other reviewers, I thought the subplot about the storm added an interesting twist.

Two other great actors, Robert Duvall and Robert Downey, Jr. were good in the film, although neither had a lot of screen time.

I must confess that it was pretty easy to figure out what was going to happen, so the ending wasn't a giant surprise.  Films these days all seem to offer a twist at the end, so I think we are all trying to out-guess the filmmakers.  It was pretty easy this time.

Moderately recommended.  The film's actors bail out what really should have been a better film.  Pick a rainy day to watch it (it really does rain in this film all the time).",1080345600,5,1178,4.271493212669683
947878,4,6304993722,"I am inclined to like Robert Altman. I like the way he paces his movies, with dialog overlapping and little quirky comments. I like that. I like the impressive cast that he always gathers. And I liked this film well enough.
I thought the storm element in this film was perfectly appropriate. It added a noir touch that I appreciated. The dialog has a sense of humor that was a treat. Cinematography is excellent, and I loved the moody score by Mark Isham. The story is well-paced, and intriquing. I was engrossed until the end.
The cast is impressive and everyone does a great job. Branagh does a great Southern accent, and his character was believable as a somewhat cocky lawyer.  I especially liked Robert Downey Jr.'s character-he was just right as Branagh's easy-going, flirty bar-hopping associate. Robert Duvall is also wonderful as a creepy old coot who doesn't like to wear shoes. An excellent, well-chosen cast.
A well-told mystery film. A solid offering.",1040169600,9,964,4.878048780487805

Slow with mediocre acting; would be my description. Also I didn't appreciate the full frontal nudity of Embeth Davidtz.",1506211200,,291,5.083333333333333
