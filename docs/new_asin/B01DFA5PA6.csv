8755834,5,B01DFA5PA6,"for some reasons, all the reviews here are for the Original Crouching Tiger movie:  Sword of Destiny is the sequel, a Netflix produced movie which follows the magnificent Crouching Tiger with a new story that is just as expertly filmed and acted and actually even better in the sense that it ""moves along"" at a much better pace.

following the tradition of the old Run Run Shaw martial arts movies, we are introduced to a colorful collection of characters , each with individual powers and skills, and once again,  in the process of ""protecting"" the Green Destiny sword, there are several sub-plots woven in that give more enlightenment to the original movie, especially in the case of Michelle Yeoh's amazing character, in which we are graced with longtime veteran of these movies, Donnie Yen.

Similar to Crouching Tiger, we also have a mysterious but impossibly beautiful heroine/?villain?  played by Natasha Liu Bordizzo, who physically combines Italian and Chinese heritage resulting in rare beauty and  who herself, is a martial arts expert and plays here role, the key role in this movie, to perfection.

Anyone wishing to continue the magic of Crouching Tiger will be ecstatic to know and see this film, and as I felt , in many ways , it might even be better than it's predecessor, in that it contains a magical ingredient of what I call ""watchability"", meaning you can watch it over and over and still be delighted.",1479859200,2,1424,4.859504132231405

8755836,2,B01DFA5PA6,"In 2000 Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" did what few foreign films had done before, which is conquer the American market. The soaring wuxia romance was a blockbuster hit and an introduction to foreign-language dramas for a lot of people, and it also earned a whopping ten Oscar nominations, winning four. Ever since, Harvey Weinstein has made it his personal mission to try and recapture that magic with a sequel, but after sixteen years there wasn't much demand for it to happen. And with the arrival ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny"" to Netflix and a few IMAX theaters, the long wait has not proven to be worth it.

Lee never had much interest in a sequel, so the responsibility for this one falls on legendary fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping, whose work on ""The Matrix"" and ""The Grandmaster"" is vastly different than anything his predecessor has achieved. Woo-ping is an amazing filmmaker, but he's not Lee and the film immediately lacks the same poetic beauty. Gone are the wind-swept aerial battles in favor of action that is more visceral, and yet still breathtakingly gorgeous in their own way. The major flaw with the film is the disappointing story, a dull romance that tries and fails to echo the original.

Michelle Yeoh is back as solitary warrior Yu Shu Lien, who after eighteen years still carries a torch for her dead lover, Li Mu Bai. Continuing to walk the noble path of the Iron Way, Lien emerges to pay respect to the late Sir Te, who had been guarding the powerful Green Destiny blade. Like before, the sword has become the target of those who would use it for evil. In this case it's the warlord Hades Dai (Jason Scott Lee) who seeks its power, and he sends the young thief Tiefang (Harry Shum Jr.) to steal it away. Also mirroring events of the first film, there's a talented but conflicted young fighter, Snow Vase (Natasha Liu Bordizzo), in need of proper guidance. Finally, Shien reaches out to other warriors to help protect the blade, and the first to answer her call is Silent Wolf (Donnie Yen), who shares a past with her and Li Mu bai that draws further connections to the previous story.

Despite all of these uniting threads, 'Sword of Destiny' feels like a completely different movie, and not in a good way. There's something low rent about it that cuts against the widescreen cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel. The landscapes aren't nearly as wondrous this time around, and while there isn't an abundance of CGI what is used doesn't meet Woo-ping's usual standards. But it has more to do with the story, which has more of an Americanized Western feel (Silent Wolf dresses and acts like a typical cowboy) to it that doesn't mesh with these characters' Eastern sensibilities. With the ethnic mix of stars it was also decided to shoot in English, which is all the more confusing when Mandarin is poorly dubbed onto a Hawaiian actor.

This also has an affect on the individual performances. Yeoh, who at 53-years-old is as physical and vital as ever, has a presence that immediately commands respect. There may not be a better synthesis of actress with a role in recent history, which makes it all the more disappointing we don't see more of her in this film. The same goes for Yen, who takes the name ""Silent Wolf"" perhaps too strongly as he barely has anything to do until the final battle. Part of that is the centerpiece fight between Silent Wolf and his two greatest foes as they gracefully glide across a cracking ice surface, an attempt to emulate the sheer majesty of the original film's gravity-defying rooftop sequence. But that's pretty much the sequel in a nutshell; it tries to fill the gigantic shoes left by a classic rather than forging its own path, and that choice left it destined to fail.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon-Sword-of-Destiny-Blu-ray/dp/B01DFA5PA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,3,4005,4.991017964071856
8755837,3,B01DFA5PA6,"Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) comes out of her self-imposed exile and joins with allies (Juju Chan, Chris Pang, Woo Young Park, and Darryl Quon) to defend the powerful Green Destiny sword from the evil warlord Hades Dai (Jason Scott Lee), who would wield it to become master of the Martial World.

This film has all of the elements of the original Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: magnificent fights, an aching story of love denied between older protagonists, and a beautiful story of emerging love between the younger (Harry Shum, Jr. and Natasha Liu Bordizzo)--but all of it falls short.  Just goes to show the value of a great director like Ang Lee.  The English dialogue was jarring and Bordizzos performance was awful, but I was still entertained--though never transported like I was with the first one.",1463184000,,805,4.904411764705882
8755838,4,B01DFA5PA6,"The Sword of Destiny is a worthy follow up to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Is it a better movie than the first one no, but the Sword of Destiny has its own special moments and story.  Once again the story seems to revolve around an ancient sword and an older couple and younger couple coming to the conclusion that oh they like each other.  I am always skeptical with any film that does not get a theatrical release.  Straight to video movies are usually pure garbage, but this film has a lot of nice cinematography little bits of humor, and an intriguing story.  Much of the story is recycled but the way the film is shot and acted is still very good.  Once again this is a great Chinese film done right with the overall story taking precedence over the special effects and action.

Watching the movie made me feel like we were visiting an old friend.  Michelle Yeoh does a wonderful job in this film as well.  She always seems like the teacher giving the younger ladies lessons or just kicking their butts. Donnie Yen (Silent Wolf) is the wiser old actor acting as Michelle Yeohs (Yu Shu Lien) guardian in the film.  The story is basically that the 2 of them were arranged to be married even though Yu Shu Lien loved Chow Yun Fat (Li Mu Bai).  Events took place and Silent Wolf lost a duel to the main villain in the film Hades Dai, which ended the marriage arrangement.  The film has lots of fantasy elements and an evil blind sorceress witch who can foresee the future.

The bar scene is kind of corny and predictable like all the warriors would be all at one place at the same time but it helps to just roll with it.  You could tell there was something between Wei Fang and Snow Vase.

What I really enjoy about both films is the back story to the side characters, a bandit thief is not always portrayed as a villain neither is a monk a saint.  Seeing Wei Fangs motivation to steal the sword to help his former master Iron Crow who raised him makes the film much better and adds a realistic quality the audience can sympathize with.

Overall I would rate the film 4 stars to 4  stars I was entertained throughout the whole movie.  The frozen lake fight scene was very cool.  The movie isn't as good as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but it doesnt embarrass itself either.  The movie ends on the happy happy ending note like out of Waynes World instead of the grittier ending to the first film.",1461715200,5,2400,4.3724604966139955
8755839,4,B01DFA5PA6,"This is a story about the Iron Way protecting the ""Green Sword of Destiny"" from the evil Hades Dai who has the Dragon Sword. In order to protect the sword the owners hire five fighters or so who have Uma Thurman skills so they can defeat a small army. Some have ""light body skill"" which I guess is the technical term for wearing a wire that pulls you up into the air. There is a story of an old renewed love and of a young love. There is plenty of fighting, minimal blood, and American style humor.

The film is in English, no dubbing. The plot was Chinese, American style. If you are a martial arts purist, this isn't your film as gravity is a law easily broken. The drama is so-so. The cinematography was good. The main characters were a bit bland, while the minor ones took on personality. Themes of honor and redemption.

Soft 4 stars.

No swearing, sex, or nudity. Woman is nude from back in low light with some minor side breast shadows.",1458864000,5,943,4.31638418079096
