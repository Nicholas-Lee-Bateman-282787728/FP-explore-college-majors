8167465,5,0767027590,"This is THE biography to have. With clips of the lady of the subject and a helpful commentary from legendary song stylist Nancy Wilson (who should get her own biography) Ella Fitzgerald's life is laid out for all to see and hear. With rare, long unseen clips of Ella in concert throughout the years, this is worth the price of admission.

From Ella's humble beginnings to the height of her fame and all that came in between you get to see artistry in motion. How could anyone watch this and say to themselves this woman should not be a national treasure?",1262649600,2,554,4.485148514851486
