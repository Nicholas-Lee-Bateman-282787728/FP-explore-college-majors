8033201,4,B0002VEWR4,"About 12 years ago we stumbled upon a classic which were we sure no one else on earth had seen except for the poor s.o.b that came up with the $500 to make it.  We are 100% convinced that this mess was filmed in one day with a home video camera, and a very cheap one at that.  The main character brings the term mullet to new hieghts, and backs it up with some amazing acting. The budget was so low that they used 2 actors to play multiple roles, which may be tough to spot by the untrained eye. We actually haven't checked out any other movies in this series. Mainly because we just figured that anyone involved with this film would have just gone back to their overnight shifts at their respective convienance stores instead of going on to make more movies. Once again, the script could very well have been the creative writting homework of a 12 year old with no friends and a slight chemical imbalance. So, obviously, this film gets a definite recomendation for a solid if not hillarious B viewing from Sid the Elf.",1182729600,4,1018,4.352631578947369
