8411926,5,B00404D9A0,"I've bought a few other Mantle videos and loved them, but the price on this one ($30) deterred me for a while. However, I put it on my wish list. When I got a gift card for Christmas and didn't know what else to do with it, I bought it. I used to be a huge Yankee fan (until George Steinbrenner took over) and always idolized Mickey Mantle. This video really did it for me--what fascinating stories, and told by the man himself. Interspersed are pictures and videos from many of the events Mantle tells us about. He was an awesome baseball player, arguably the best ever. He also was a tragically flawed individual. Most of this video was recorded in the late '80s, five or six years before his death. Mantle is very modest about his baseball accomplishments. At the same time, he recognizes and admits his shortcomings, admonishing all (especially children) not to follow his bad example. For all his accomplishments and abilities, Mantle remained humble and unassuming. Somehow he could never understand the public's captivation with him. As the video asserts, Mantle may be more of an idol now than he was at any time during his life. Even if you're not a Yankee fan or even much of a Mantle fan (are there such people?), any baseball fan would be mesmerized by this video. At two hours, you'll get your money's worth and that doesn't even include all the extras, such as his 10 longest home runs. In all, this video took me over three hours to watch. I have no reservations in recommending this video to any baseball fan.",1476144000,,1525,4.569343065693431
8411927,5,B00404D9A0,"I purchased this from the official Mickey Mantle site years ago and have watched the couple hour program many times... what you have is many fun clips of the Mick playing etc but what most of the two hours is ....is Mickey Mantle sitting in his trophy room casually dressed in a sweater and very engagingly discussing his entire life and career.

This is time capsule stuff and I can only dream about so many other great icons of Sport, finance and politics that it would be amazing to have a couple hours of them talking directly to the camera about their lives and elaborating on stories true and only legend.

If you are a fan I recommend this without reservation ...its going to be a treasure in your Yankee/Mantle collection....and that is from a lifetime Dodger fan!!",1350345600,9,773,4.594202898550725
