7879598,5,6304872992,"Tania and Lana are certified yoga instructors. Lana's recovery from a head on collision that left her body shattered is testimony to the power of her yoga. The words and imagery are inspiring and the moves are practical and advanced. This video will remain a classic long after the others have gone.
The scenery of Oak Creek and Sedona's Red Rocks are breath-taking and professional. Also be sure to check out their multiple Award Winning Children's' Book - ""How Butterbees Came to Be"".",1238371200,2,486,4.867469879518072
7879599,2,6304872992,"If you've done yoga to a video tape before, you know that the only time you'll ever keep your eyes on the screen is, perhaps, the first time you play it. In this tape, the instructor guides you into the pose verbally, then says ""repeat on the other side"", and then nothing; she leaves you no time cues about when she's ready to move on to the next thing. This ruins the tape for all practical purposes. Also, there's lot's of useless advice like ""be limber"". And lots of flowery imaginative suggestions that are distracting and counter productive to emptying the mind of thought. Plus she doesn't give you enough time to develop those fantasies if you're inclined to do so. The two stars are for the beautiful photography and the creative mirroring of poses by the instructor's look-alike sister.",1063324800,2,796,4.692857142857143
