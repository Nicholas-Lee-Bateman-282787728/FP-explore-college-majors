8305200,4,B001GF5KAI,"If you want to know the process chefs go through to produce exquisitely divine dishes, Paul Lacoste follows Michel Troisgros around his hometown and kitchen showing you exactly how he works. It was interesting to see how ingredients are chosen, prepared and arranged to finally produce a taste sensation.

Michel Troisgros himself seems very talented but he also has a lot of experienced chefs to help him put his dishes together. He shows great respect for those he works with but also is willing to say when someone's idea is not top notch. It was very interesting to watch how meringues were filled with various fillings and tasted. Then they show how the final dish looked.

Michel Troisgros seems a bit eccentric in that he does things like preserves his own fish or has bottles and bottles of interesting items you would maybe not find in any regular chef's kitchen. Basically this DVD takes you into a very interesting chef's kitchen and you will be enlightened in regards to how gourmet foods are produced.

The film is in French but there are English subtitles. If you love to cook I think you will enjoy this film.

8305201,5,B001GF5KAI,I bought this DVD to complete the set and was very impressed by the chef.  Spends a lot of time in the kitchen so you get to see a lot of the chef's thought process and technique.,1455753600,,179,3.8378378378378377
8305202,4,B001GF5KAI,"This is a documentary about Michele Troisgros, his famous restaurant, and his family. There's some material about cooking, we see the development and testing of a dish, although it turns out to be not very innovative, but the DVD's main content is interviews with the Troisgros family, and local scenery. Four stars for lack of cooking.",1261958400,3,336,5.017857142857143
8305203,5,B001GF5KAI,"My original review was 3 stars. Shame. My own damn fault. I forced myself to watch all of it, including the extras. I figured I should since i paid twenty bucks for this. I am now so glad I did.

It's probably the best in the series as it covers the evolution of one of his dishes from the base concept to the final dish. He vocalizes his thought process and involves his kitchen team. The same in the extras section of the DVD - he figures out what to do with some meringue shells that have been created. Good, geeky, pore over minutiae section after the slow start.

BAD: Starting with voiceover / dubs going to subtitles and ending with voiceover's. Bit weird.

Content wise, totally worth it.",1259107200,4,696,4.37984496124031
