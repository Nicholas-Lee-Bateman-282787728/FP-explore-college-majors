1621979,1,B00005LIR9,"It is unbelievable that in this movie shots are taken from other movie and paste. The plane hijack and crash sequence is take from cliffhanger it is so clear, In between movie shots are taken from various movies. Length of this movie is @ 1hr & 32min. till up to 1hr 23min there nothing is happening but suddenly there is climax now again this is taking from gena Davis movie. I like to ask director & producer do you think people are full they will not come to know by using outher movie shots.
Don't even think of watching this move.",1018224000,,535,4.306930693069307
1621980,2,B00005LIR9,"I think the movie editors forgot to go over the film after shooting.  The movie contains numerous technical errors and cliche dialogue that you find in most action movies.  However, the movie is so bad, it's funny!  Treat Williams hardly shows any emotion playing his U.S. agent character.  Some of the explosion scenes in the movie, especially one at the end, are pretty cool.  Oh, and don't bother reading the storyline summary on the back of the video box because most of it is incorrect!",1013040000,,491,4.729411764705882

1621982,2,B00005LIR9,This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers.

1621987,2,B00005LIR9,"In CRASH POINT ZERO, which is commonly marketed as ""Extreme Limits,"" Treat Williams and a no-name cast plus action scenes pinched from other movies all coalesce into one of the biggest 90 minute misamas of the year 2001.

It's an absolute stinker about a plane carrying a death ray invented by Nicholas Tesla that crashes in the Canadian mountains. To keep this dangerous weapon from falling into the wrong hands, the CIA comes to the rescue.

Can you say: ""BORING""?
(NOTE: currenty rated 3.1 at IMDb.)

The director of ""Extreme Limits,"" exploitation specialist Jim Wynorski, got his Hollywood start cutting movie trailers for  ""King of the B's"" Roger Corman. With megaphone, beret and jodhpurs he's directly responsible for such ""classics"" as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CHOPPING-MALL/dp/B0002DB5PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CHOPPING MALL</a>&nbsp;(1986),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BIG-BAD-MAMA-II/dp/B000060MVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BIG BAD MAMA II</a>&nbsp;(1988),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RETURN-OF-THE-SWAMP-THING/dp/B00007L4NB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RETURN OF THE SWAMP THING</a>&nbsp;(1989),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MUNCHIE/dp/B00008G7BH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MUNCHIE</a>&nbsp;(1992),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MUNCHIE-STRIKES-BACK/dp/B00007CVSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MUNCHIE STRIKES BACK</a>&nbsp;(1994),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BARE-WENCH-PROJECT/dp/6305854416/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BARE WENCH PROJECT</a>&nbsp;(2000) and its various sequels and permutations.

1621988,1,B00005LIR9,"Remember everyone in an uproar over Vanilla Ice and the song by Queen? You'll understand in a moment. I was given this dvd by a relative. Not having seen Cliffhanger, I did not notice anything other that what looked like a cheezy plot about an almost magical thought weapon that miraculously shields the weilder, of course, and a tired old man trying to get some from an tired old woman. Most of the acting gave a high-school-drama-class-impression, and I don't mean the kids who got an A in the class. When they got to the scenes with the semi, though, it just got retarded. The Long Kiss Goodnight is one of my all time favorite movies, and I started getting really mad. I mean, at the beginning of the DVD, they force you to watch this stupid Federal warning about copyright infringement punishments, then show this? Didn't Queen sue Vanilla Ice, and that was just a backbeat. I WARN in the strongest possible words for potential buyers of this DVD to not waste their money. Pirated material rates no stars. All buying this DVD will do is promote what was an illegal, and just plain stupid act. I turned my copy into a frisby at the landfill.",1116892800,2,1145,4.536231884057971
1621989,3,B00005LIR9,"What you can learn from reading other reviews!  As my wife sat and watched this movie, I kept thinking that the big explosion at the end reminded me of another movie..the far superior LONG KISS GOODNIGHT.  And now that I have read the other reviews, I see where they used footage from CLIFFHANGER and NARROW MARGIN.  Hmmm...studios will go to extreme lengths to make movies huh?

As far as the rest of the movie goes, Treat Williams is all but lost in a small role as the CIA special agent with the warped sense of humor.  Most of the focus is given to the budding romance of John Beck and Susan Blakeley, survivors of the ridiculously staged plane crash.  Add Bongo the Bear and a subdued Steve Franken and there's even more foolishness.  Not to mention the other survivors who go off on their own; one dies from unknown causes; the stupid wildlife t.v. star (hah) shows her stupidity by firing a gun and causing an avalance that wipes out everyone except the two lovebirds who have just reconciled.  We also have a crooked pilot, a diabetic man and his daughter, and oh yes, a Tessla device that uses brainwaves to cause nuclear destruction.

Why the three stars?  The scenery is beautiful; I found myself interested in spite of myself, and some of the performances were enjoyable, particularly Ms. Blakeley's alcoholic writer.  But the big ""character development"" scenes only served to slow down the movie's overall pacing.  But considering the theft from other movies, one can only laugh and say, gee whiz!!!",1107907200,2,1512,4.729007633587786
1621990,3,B00005LIR9,"For and ""original work"" how could the producers and director hope to get away with the ""Cliffhanger"", ""Narrow Margin"" and ""A Long Kiss Goodnight"" cut and paste scenes.  These are not copies, these are the actual scenes from the movies, cut and pasted into this one.  My son about fell out of his chair as we watched the plane and helicopter sequences, the chases and train sequenses, the semi truck sequences and climactic explosion that we had seen from other movies.  He wanted to know if those actors got royalties off of this movie, especially Craig Berko who was clearly seen but not credited.
That aside, there were many cliche moments, some good lines, and some very bad dialog.  But it was worth watching, especially with someone who does not know (or even one who does but hasn't yet seen it) about the cut and paste because it makes for a hilarious (absolutely unintended by the makers, I'm sure) movie experience and a great conversation after the movie among friends.  I have never had such an experience before...",1055548800,,1026,4.741573033707865
1621991,1,B00005LIR9,"From the start this movie had all the making of a real bomb. The JetStar and DC-9 aircraft scenes were totally bogus.
