8331580,4,B001OTZOO8,"I knew Trip through many parts of my life, less a few significant gaps. This movie filled in those gaps. It was an excellent documentary about the darker side of a man that was highly respected in his field. It shows that drugs can take down anyone and is a tribute to his recovery. He was a great horseman, trainer, and coach. Absolutely beautiful on a horse. It is unfortunate that it was not completed until after his death because what he did with his recovery, his climb back up, I believe was his highest point.",1370304000,2,517,4.395833333333333
