8424923,5,B004D7SBD4,I love Nova and the many interesting and exciting topics this particular series with Neil Degrass Tyson has. This episode doesn't disappoint. I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about (I think it is about a different episode and it doesn't make sense to me what he is saying). I think this episode is very informative and future-forward. It explores how in the future we could have things like self-driving cars and robot assistants. I personally enjoyed it very much.,1425340800,2,480,4.865853658536586
