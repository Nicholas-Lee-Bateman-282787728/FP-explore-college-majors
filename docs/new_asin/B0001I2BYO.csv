8012787,4,B0001I2BYO,"F.E.D.S. gives a peek into interesting lives.  I appreciate Pee Wee Kirkland's interview about Harlem streetball and the ups and downs of his life.  I found the expanse on LA Bloods and Crips extremely interesting.  While watching the DVD one actually feels like they get a sense of what is going on out there in ""the streets.""",1151798400,2,327,4.701754385964913
8012788,1,B0001I2BYO,"....I somehow, watched the whole movie all the way through but after viewing it, in its entirety..I was somewhat dissappointed. They the viewer said earlier, I was expected more raw footage but what we got was interviews.

Some of the interviews were interesting, some of the footage was interesting but some just aint gonna cut it in my opinion. I don't know why these people mislead us by saying stuff like ""Uncut, Uncensored, Raw..."" and knowing it's everything but that.

I give it 1 star because I felt like I was mislead and I would like my money back...",1128729600,,560,4.646464646464646
8012789,1,B0001I2BYO,"The movies wasn't what I expected.  I thought it would be more raw, instead, it was full of talk and interviews.  If you are looking for something like that, this is what you are looking for.  If you are looking for raw footage, this is not for you.",1127865600,,249,4.145833333333333
8012790,5,B0001I2BYO,"I've read the magazine a couple of times and really liked it but I'm really feeling this DVD.  I like the mission.  They seek to show you the truth of the streets (as far as crime is concerned) but it seems more fact based and not really glorifying it.  If anything, the DVD shows kids what can really go wrong with the lifestyle that most videos seems to promote.  In fact it's really interesting hearing real gangsters scream on these rap cats - they really hate how fake they are.  I rented the DVD, but I definitely plan on buying it.",1085875200,4,538,4.287128712871287
