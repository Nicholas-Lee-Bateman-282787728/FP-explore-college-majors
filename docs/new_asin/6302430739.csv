463314,5,6302430739,"I recall seeing this at the Circle Theater in Washington, DC two or three years after its original release.  The Circle was a repertory cinema four blocks from the White House.  In 1986 the owners closed it, and the building was razed.

I recommend this film based on my 27 - year - old memories of it.  A lot of realism.  Diners and small apartments are reconstructed in detail so you time travel to the 1950s.  Many scenes take place in cold weather; I could feel it.  Christopher Walken's performance stands out.

It's not for children anywhere or for adults in the Bible Belt.  Other reviewers haven't mentioned three points in the film that may puzzle a child or offend an adult in the Bible Belt or an adult who thinks Leave It To Beaver and What's My Line reflect 1950s America.

# 1 -- A member of the gang of Greenwich Villagers named Anita is introduced when the gang announces gleefully that she's committing suicide and they must witness it.  They practically skip down the street on the way to her apartment.  Turns out she was just threatening to do it.

Anita later joins the gang in a diner and goes with the flow.  She stops talking about her personal problems and keeps up with the rapid conversations. Topics include the prosecution and death sentences for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.  I couldn't figure out if Anita was supposed to be Jewish or Catholic.  Her mannerisms and last name can suggest either group.

# 2 -- In several scenes, the main character and his girlfriend refer to the form of birth control known as a diaphragm.  If you want your kids to think that device first became available on the solstice that launched the Summer of Love in 1967, then keep this DVD away from them.

# 3 -- When the main character, an aspiring actor, must rehearse a scene outside the theater, he lets his mother (Shelley Winters) read the lines of his character's leading lady.  In fact, mother and son rehearse a love scene, and they kiss passionately.  I couldn't figure out if filmmaker Paul Mazursky was implying that their relationship had an incestuous undercurrent.

All in all, Mr. Mazursky convinces me that in the 1950s, Greenwich Village and the rest of the United States were different planets.

I would love to see a 1950s San Francisco other than the one seen in Vertigo.  Were I to see it I might put S.F. on the same planet as Greenwich Village.  I suspect that the Madison, Wisconsin of the 1950s might belong on this ""Alternative To Leave It To Beaver Planet,"" but such a film seems unlikely to get made now that five decades have passed.  (People from those cities who could help the set designers have died.)  Thanks, Mr. Mazursky, for capturing what you captured when it was just 20 years old.",1154217600,5,2729,4.5847107438016526
463315,5,6302430739,"This is a bittersweet film about family, leaving ""the nest"", friendships, dreams, hope, & finding yourself. A young man from Brooklyn leaves home to become an actor in 1950's Greenwich Village. The late Lenny Baker is very good as Larry Lapinsky & Ellen Green is wonderful as his girlfriend. The quirky characters & situations around them add an ambiance to this movie that makes you believe it was filmed in the 1950's, & not the 70's, when it was actually made. A lot of attention was paid to detail & it shows. Shelly Winters is loud, obnoxious, funny & convincing as the typical Jewish mother (I love the scene when she shows up at his apartment with a chicken). This movie makes you wish you could jump into the film & sit with these characters, have coffee with them, ride the subway, go to one of Larry's rent parties, & experience the progressive, offbeat world of New York's Greenwich Village in the 1950's.",1143849600,7,916,4.625766871165644
463316,4,6302430739,"Next Stop, Greenwich Village was one of the smaller, gems of a movie, that came out in 1976, and for whatever reason was diffcult to find even on vhs (except for overly priced copies) for years, so I was happy to come across a copy of the dvd- which was a low-key dvd release.  The quality of the dvd is great for such a bargain price. Set in the early 1950's, you forget that this a 30 yr old film, except when you see the much younger Chris Walken, Jeff Goldblum, and a brief glimpse of Bill Murray. Wonderful acting performances by the entire cast.  Buy this dvd, sit back, and take the subway to the Village and you will be in for a real treat.",1136332800,6,648,4.134920634920635
463317,4,6302430739,"I agree with the other reviews here, a very special movie and one that will be of special interest to amateur filmmakers, budding actors, etc for its humourous yet realistic portrayal of 'the scene'.

Worth special mention is then-unknown Chris Walken's performance as a small-time Lothario. I remember watching this film when it was first released in theaters, and was very impressed by this newcomer to the screen. Alas, after playing the psycho GI in The Deer Hunter the following year, he became forever typecast for 'weird' roles. You can really see Walken's largely untapped potential to play complete unrelated roles here. Hence if you're a Walken fan, you have to see this one.

Would love to see this one come out on DVD. C'mon guys, do it.",1102204800,5,749,4.84375
463318,5,6302430739,"It's hard to explain the lack of public response to this charming comedy in 1976. Perhaps because it was released when all cities, especially New York City, were having such hard times. Or maybe it was the casting of mostly unknowns that sank it.
For whatever reason, Paul Mazursky's NEXT STOP GREENWICH VILLAGE is a classic movie about youthful ambition, betrayal, tragedy, and never-ending surplus of hope. While most directors ultimately wind up knee-deep in schlock when making a movie about their youths, Mazursky keeps his focus on honesty. There's an integrity in his examination of these young characters, as they support and/or abuse each other in pursuit of their aspirations.
The performances are sparklers. The late Lenny Baker contributes just the right amounts of comedy, self-doubt and, ultimately, self-confidence the role demands. And, as others have mentioned, Shelley Winters is totally priceless! NEXT STOP GREENWICH VILLAGE should be your next purchase.
PS--When will the dvd version come out?",1089072000,29,1014,5.383647798742138
463319,5,6302430739,"This early Paul Mazursky film could well be his finest achievement.  Wonderfully mixing irony and affection, it examines bohemian New York in the 50's, its scenes generously filled with the assorted types - from fragile to vicious - who then flocked to Greenwich Village, seeking personal freedom and frequently a career in the arts. Mazursky's knowledge of that time and place is unerring; the pubs, the street life and the character types he presents are accurately, hilariously and, often, movingly drawn. From the frequenters of the San Remo to the Brando imitators at the Actor's Studio, he recreates the aspiring young people of a time long since gone but still fresh in the memories of some persons who were part of it.
 A nostalgic invocation of the past, however, is not the film's sole or even chief strength. That honor goes instead to the amazing part of the actor hero's mother brilliantly portrayed by Shelley Winters, clearly in the role of her career.  She is the Jewish Mother On Film for all time.  Not just a stereotypical devotee of the classic formula - control guilt feelings and you control the child - she is also, surprisingly and freshly, herself a frustrated artist.  When she weeps over the radio singing of Jussi Bjorling, vowing to hear him in person at the Met, or unconventionally jitterbugs, mad glint in her eye, with a black gay guy at a Greenwich Village party she crashes, we feel affection for her despite her cluelessness and manipulations.  Hers is an unfulfilled life in Brooklyn, for she's bursting with an artist's energy which has no outlet.  This becomes the ground of her aspiring actor son's and then our eventual respect and affection for her despite her meddling as the would-be power behind the son's throne. ""Next Stop Greenwich Village,"" all told, is a film of considerable distinction, and it deserves to be far better known.",1027209600,26,1878,4.886792452830188
463320,5,6302430739,"This is an autobiographical film by Mazursky featuring young, then unknown New York actors like Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Murray, and it gives us one of Shelly Winter's best performances (it's  unforgettable).  Greenwich Village in the 50s, the Bohemian era with its  cafes, rent parties, and blossoming sexual freedoms.  Lenny Baker promised  to be our own Jean-Paul Belmondo--he died young--and this is his best  performance: sensible, yearning, funny, and blossoming with talent and  ambition, he catches it perfectly.  The remaining cast is surprisingly  powerful, and the mood that Mazursky catches is memorable: freedom and  youth, humor and youthful hypocrisy in an era cracking at the seams to  reinvent the world and still have it all.",939600000,45,762,5.427350427350428
463411,4,6302430739,"I saw this when it came out, nearly 40 years ago, and was so enthralled by it that I have remembered it vividly ever since.  Seeing it again now for the first time, I must say it stands the test of time and adds many delights, in particular the many unknowns who have since became very famous, such as Walken.

The plot revolves around a kid who wants to become an actor, leaving his old fashioned, lower middle class parents aghast, particularly his ""very Jewish mother"", played to perfection by SHelly Winters.  He moves to the Village and joins a wonderful group of friends.  They party, philosophize, and sleep together, sometimes all at the same time.  It captures the spirit of youth in ways that made me nostalgic, as I experienced similar things.

This isn't particularly deep, though some sad things happen.  It records a moment, just before things open up much much more in the 1960s.

Warmly recommended.",1382227200,2,915,4.710691823899371
463412,5,6302430739,"It's a really nice movie. The characters are memorable, and the story is very good. It has just the right amount of serious and funny moments. I'm surprised this movie is not more well-known.",1379548800,4,191,4.647058823529412
463413,4,6302430739,"This movie was featured in a local Jewish Film Festival that I was unable  to attend.  Based on its inclusion, I felt it was probably a movie worth seeing, so I bought it and I did enjoy it.",1290643200,,190,3.973684210526316
463414,5,6302430739,"I don't know what it is about the NEXT STOP, GREENWICH VILLAGE DVD that I find so endearing. I'm not Jewish, am a California native, and this time period was way before my time, but somehow this movie is strangely appealing, comforting, and familiar to me.

Anyway, the story is about a young man named Larry Lapinsky (Lenny Baker) who finally gets to leave his Jewish parents' home in Brooklyn to move to a place of his own in New York City's famed Greenwich Village in the mid 1950s. This was around the time that the bohemian/beatnik movements were beginning to bloom, and Larry finds himself right at home with a motley group of people including his  girlfriend played by Ellen Greene who portrayed ""Audrey"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Shop-of-Horrors-Snap-Case/dp/B00004RF8J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Shop of Horrors (Snap Case)</a>&nbsp;and other artist/actor types. Shelly Winters was fantastic as Larry's shrill, harping mother and Antonio Fargas is wonderful as Larry's gay friend ""Bernstein Chandler."" The rest of the cast is superb as well and you get to see some great exterior shots of NYC & the Village, albeit circa 1975-76 when the movie was actually filmed.

Some might find this movie pointless, but I enjoyed it and there are some really touching scenes in it.

The picture quality is good, but the only special features included are the trailer and audio commentary with Ellen Greene and writer director Paul Mazursky.",1267574400,5,1503,5.437768240343348
463415,5,6302430739,"Excellent acting. Fun movie with real situations of life which seldom are exposed that openly today. It is nice to ""feel"" the old Greenwich Village, and NYC again. Loved it.",1259280000,4,173,4.8
463416,4,6302430739,"I recommend this wonderful film. Being Jewish, having lived in New York as a young girl, it was rather nostalgic for me. Typcial Jewish family ""Drama"" and I love it!!! Shelly Winters, most magnificent in her role as the domineering mother. All the actors were right on target. I hightly recommend this film, grab some popcorn (Kosher) and enjoy the film.

463417,3,6302430739,"The Dave Brubeck music tracks backing the action were recorded long after 1953 when this film was set, as any jazz fan will immediately notice. And the street light poles are circa 1970s. Still, there's something warmly effective about this NYC period piece, even if Shelly Winters gets on your nerves as the Jewish mother. It's fun seeing 1976 New York set-dressed to look 20 years younger. The Caffe Reggio hasn't changed, though, even today. A little dated, overall, but worth the watch, as any Mazursky film usually is.",1229299200,5,523,4.887640449438202
463418,5,6302430739,"In addition to the fine acting (Shelley Winters and Mike Kellin) and script, don't overlook the Brubeck soundtrack ([...] -- not available on CD) that sets the mood, time, and place perfectly.

A gem of a film.",1215388800,4,210,4.675675675675675
463419,4,6302430739,"This is a sweet memoire of a precious time in the life of Paul Mazursky.  The man has a lot of heart and it shows here in this film which could have been really bad in the hands of a lesser writer/director.  The characters are familiar to us:  the aspiring actor from Brooklyn, trying desperately to get away from his overbearing Jewish mamma, the henpecked dad, the younger set of arty types of mixed races and sexual preferences.  What keeps the film fresh is the very real affection Mazursky feel for the folks; otherwise they could have fallen into terrible cliches.

The cast is uniformly good and perfectly chosen for their roles.  Shelly Winters as the Mom gives one of her best performances, in my opinion.  She is an actress whose shrill over-the-top style often turns me off and she still lets the stops go here but there is a warmth and genuine joie de vivre that I found endearing.  The actor who plays the dad has few lines to say, as he did in life, but his face tells a lot.  I found his presence quite moving and again he avoided the stereotype and brought a genuine human feeling to it.  Ellen Greene is very good as the pretty Jewish girl who is the love interest.  We never know quite how she feels about the actor; she plays it just right, somewhere between sweet and cagey.

Lenny Baker is Larry Lipinsky, the Mazursky alter ego.  I suppose that since Mazursky chose him, he was right for the role.  Personally I found him a little annoying, especially when he went into his grandiose acting spiels, but that's  no doubt how 22 year old aspiring actors in the 50's were.

Christopher Walken, who is billed as ""Chris Walken"" is eye catching in a small role, as Robert, one of the buddies.  He is portrayed as a cold hearted bastard, as opposed to Lenny who truly loves the girl, but frankly I thought the girl made the right choice by running off with him to Mexico.  Lenny's version of love is just as egotistical in its own way as Robert's and his sense of moral superiority is a bit unfounded-- especially when he hit the girl.  Jeff Goldblum gives a noteworthy cameo, too.  No wonder Walken and Goldblum went on to greater roles.

It's a period piece and people who love New York, especially the New York of the 50's will find a lot to like in this film.",1205971200,4,2278,4.414868105515588

7825788,1,6302430739,I found this movie very disappointing.,1463011200,,38,5.5
7825789,4,6302430739,"This is a Paul Mazursky movie, from 1976, that, as you watch it, can seem inconsequential and even irritating (because many of the characters are irritating), but it stays in the mind and invites reflection -- and how many movies do that, really?  It's set in 1953, and it's narrative seems pretty random, but behind that apparently casual movement, there's a thematic backbone.  The dialogue of the movie is such that you're not hit over the head with thematic issues, but they emerge fairly naturally from the drama and make a satisfying whole of a movie that at first seemed kind of trivial.

The moment in the movie where I cottoned to what was going on was when Larry Lapinsky (Lenny Baker) goes to see his friend Robert (the young Christopher Walken) to have it out with him about Robert's sleeping with Larry's girlfriend, Sarah (Ellen Greene), and you expect a punch to be thrown.  Larry sneers at Robert, a pretentious aspiring writer, ""Underneath the pose, it's just all pose"" (not an exact quotation) -- but he doesn't hit him.  Why?  I came to see that that sneer is as applicable to Larry as it is to Robert -- and as it is too to their young gay friend Bernstein (Antonio Fargas).  ALL these early-20's males in Greenwich Village are posers -- they're trying out roles, hoping to be something (ironically, for Larry, he hopes to be an actor), but they haven't become ANYTHING yet -- Jeff Goldblum is wonderful in a cameo as Clyde Baxter,  another aspiring actor, as pretentious and empty in his way as Robert is in his.  Mazursky isn't making a big moral point of this -- rather, the movie seems to be suggesting that this was the form that immaturity took among young sensitive males in the 1950s.  They're a bit ridiculous and impercipient, but not really malicious, and to a certain extent they represent a support group for one another.  The female characters, Sarah and the self-hating Anita (Lois Smith), are much more themselves -- they're grounded and not self-deceptive in the way the young men are.  By the end of the movie, Larry gets a call to Hollywood to take a small part in a gangster movie -- he could just as easily have been passed over, as Clyde was.  But off he goes . . .  By the way, the scenes of auditions and acting classes are just marvelous and funny, sometimes painfully so.

Perhaps the most striking performance in the movie is that of Shelley Winters as Fay Lapinsky, Larry's mother.  At first, she seems acaricature, a Jewish mother having hysterics in Brooklyn because her only son is going all the way to Greenwich Village (!) -- but it turns out that Fay has a histrionic side that she is much more in control of than first appears.  I'll avoid spoilers by not going into details, but Winters just about walks away with the movie.  Ellen Greene gives a very strong performance too, and I don't mean to imply that the male actors are weak -- far from it.  It's amazing to see the young Walken and Goldblum strut their stuff, sounding pretty much as they still do!  Lenny Baker gets Larry right -- likeable and irritating in equal measure -- but at least he doesn't have a sense of entitlement: he works in Lou Jacobi's deli, and Lou obviously likes him.  That's good enough for me.",1455667200,,3230,4.572916666666667

The storyline has an array of emotional scenes where you're laughing wholeheartedly and one time and then it springs a dart into your gut the next where you have to heal from the circumstances you just witnessed.  All actors are superb in their roles.  Jeff Goldblum has a bit part playing a naive egocentric actor, and Shelley Winters as an overprotected mother is something else.  A few other excellent actors in this movie are Christopher Walken, Ellen Greene, Lois Smith, Antonio Fargas, Dori Brenner, and, of course, Lenny Baker.  Lenny Baker gives heart and soul to this movie, he makes the movie in my opinion.
