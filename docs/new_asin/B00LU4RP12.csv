6506605,4,B00LU4RP12,"Great mystery movie, but it left it unclear who is the real slasher.  The boy said he didn't know the reporter and at the beginning of the movie & throughout it made it appear that the cop was the slasher that received the boy's mom's heart.  So was the reporter the slasher or was the cop with the heart transplant the slasher.  Jensen was killed so they cannot say that they cop with the heart transplant changed because he had the heart transplant.  The reporter the boy said he didn't know him.  So we assume the reporter was the slasher.  They left it kind of unsure there at the end.  That is messed up especially no Heart of Fear II.  Love a movie that you cannot guess right away who and what right at the first five minutes, but do want to know at the ending.",1416960000,,768,4.212328767123288

6506611,1,B00LU4RP12,"Worst acted film I have seen in a long time. **SPOILER ALERT++I am seriously into watching a film, and rarely walk out or stop watching. I watched it all, and it was seriously cringeworthy--like Showgirls cringeworthy. The lead police detective is so over the top, his acting is like watching Kojak on roids, but without the lollipop. The FBI profiler lead, had full visage rocking morning, noon and night, Any more eye shimmering highlighter and she could pass as a drag queen. (""Not that there is anything wrong with that"" -Seinfeld) it just seems so incredulous. Her acting is all over the map, forcing invisible tears, we are supposed to believe that an FBI profiler is going to be able to adopt the child they are protecting ( now that he is an orphan. Then there was my favorite: The FBI profiler walks into the Detective's office. It sounds like a million footsteps, then when they stop moving you can hear a few more steps. Good work Sound Person wherever you are. The twist at the end could have been great, but alas no, it introduced a new lead character and the viewer is trying to decipher what the heck is going on. This movie is a stinker. Look for something else. Cliche dialog and bad acting. Waste of time.",1491004800,7,1223,4.5636363636363635

6506644,3,B00LU4RP12,"This would have been a good movie if the ACTORS could act. Don't people have any pride in doing a good job anymore.  The young man who played Taylor was the only actor in the film.  I hope this didn't stop him from getting good acting jobs.
Here's what I learned:  There are almost 350 men name Brandon Bass.  A NBA basketball player kept coming on top--Amazon has about 13 pages on him none on the actor.  Brandon  Bass the actor was in three films and a long term tv series.
Hip Hop Harry -- a children educational tv series (2006--until he aged out of part)
Heart of Fear (2006)
The McPassion (2006) with his brother Cameron Bass-- A mini movie (some kind of Christian satire) shown online March 1 - April 15, 2006.  After that only at film festivals.  A few DVDs were made for ""chosen people""

6506650,3,B00LU4RP12,"The movie plot was based on a good concept, but much of it was unrealistic. I personally found the acting to be terrible. The acting and direction was so bad that at some points I found myself cringing for the actor/actress. I gave it three stars because it did hold my attention, because I needed to find out how it ended. The ending was a bit of a surprise, but again the acting ruined it. I found it to be a decent enough movie to fill a boring night, but I would not recommend it to someone who is looking to have a good movie night.",1467590400,,537,4.0754716981132075

6506694,4,B00LU4RP12,"Four stars for the entertainment. I liked the FBI and Detective banterings. I thought Taylor played his part well and I liked Jack who pushed the adoption papers through for Sam to adopt Taylor. Tom came in as a reporter highly interested in the Taylor Green case. Tom is the typical psychopath--someone to be very aware of and mark every word they say, then run like the heck out of their life. Maybe the movie was too short for as many actors as there were. The movie focused mostly on Sam, then on the dectective, then on Taylor, then on Tom who was not exposed to the audience enough to make a determination of his character. Tom was very bold like a good reporter should be, but he seemed to be more than a reporter and in my opinion, his time spent in and around the police was unusual, but he was over-looked. Sam, on the other hand, gets a big fat zero for failing psychology in the real world. Even from my perspective, I could see there was something odd about Tom. He was very aggressive, especially when Sam was breaking up with him. I thought for sure she would have clued in to Tom's personality. Not the greatest detective movie, but four stars for lazy entertainment.",1451001600,,1183,4.431192660550459

6506700,1,B00LU4RP12,"Sound quality should be worked on.  The story seems lost amid evenly-spaced scenes of bare boobs and attempts to show steamy sexual encounters, none of which would detract from the overall movie if removed.  Confusing changes of locations, and literally last moment toss-in of inexplicable reasons why child reacted and a male lead was present, all could have been fleshed out more to make this a much better movie.  could have been a good flick - but someone wanted more boob view than story.",1428019200,2,493,4.845238095238095

When the male lead who only has four movies in four decades doesn't even list this one in his bio, you know it's bad. Fun can be had by identitying the errors in the acting, scenes, and script.
