831439,5,6304293488,"I've been to Watership Down. No, seriously, it's real. There is a hill with a steep slope covered in old rabbit warrens. There aren't many rabbits there now.
Rabbits have been systematically destroyed in England for  hundreds of years. The more common methods have gone into germ warfare,  with Mixymitosis being one of the great killers (an incredibly disgusting,  slow, painful disease). This film portrays a fairly accurate depiction of  the rabbits life, strung through with the notion that rabbits are capable  of reason as we are.
It invokes strong feelings in anyone who watches it,  and it doesn't pull punches to protect people from reality (even for a  cartoon!). The animation suffers on occasion, but this is more than made up  for by the very feel of the entire picture - I dare most people not to feel  the tears building at the end of the film!
This is truly an excellent  film, but parents should watch it first before showing their children to  ensure that they think it is suitable.",926467200,2,1000,4.755813953488372
831440,5,6304293488,"I must have been about 10 and my mother wasn't too happy with the violence as I recall, but the images have stayed with me in all that time.  It was such a powerful story and so well done despite the violent undertones.  I  get choked up still!  I saw this movie in the store and snapped it up as  soon as I saw it, I recognized it immediately even though I hadn't known  the title. I enjoy it today as much as I did all those years ago and it was  nice finally to fill in all the holes in my memory.",924739200,,500,3.796116504854369
831441,1,6304293488,"This video is mainly about Spring Break and narrated by Billy Joe Royal (of course, his video is in there).  But the Grand Funk song at the beginning, ""Paranoid"" is all audio with various pychedelic scenes  of Grand Funk Railroad.  But the only reason why I got this is that I am a  Grand Funk Railroad fan and member of the Internet Fan Club  ""Roadkill"" and wanted at least one video of GFR.  The end is  where the GFR video is, with Mark, Don, and Mel in 1968-69 timeframe  playing ""Into The Sun"", which, in itself, is cool and great!!!  They've  got a new LIVE CD out called ""Bosnia"" and re-mastered release of  their 1976 ""Good Singin' Good Playin'"" with a VH-1 Behind the  Music special on March 7, 1999.

831442,4,6304293488,"Don't let the description of 'rabbit adventures' fool you, this is *not* a children's film.  The adventures are not simply about bunnies, but is rife with rich metaphors and includes a clairvoyant rabbit who predicts a  foreboding future for the rabbit civilization.  Don't get me wrong, there  are some more lighthearted sections. . . including a laughable sea gull.  Beautifully created in the style of dark water colors, the animation  provides well-done interpretation of the book.  It's one of my favorite  films, but almost terrifying and very engrossing for most adults, my friend  saw it when she was a kid though. . .  One animated scene alluding to death  is accompanied by a beautiful song by Art Garfunkel called 'Sad Eyes', my  friend cried (so did i).  The introductory fable scene is neat, too.  Many  thanks to my High School friend Nathan who introduced it to me.",911260800,,880,4.891156462585034

831961,3,6304293488,"I watched this movie after finishing the book of the same name by Richard Adams.  The book is quite close to flawless, but I'm afraid that for me, the movie didn't capture the magic of the book.  I know that I shouldn't compare the movie to the book, but I can't help it.  So if you haven't read the book, this review may not be so helpful to you--this is only for those who have read the book.

The positive:  the movie is relatively faithful to the book.  Most of the changes are to reduce the length of the film.  A number of ancillary plots are omitted and some plot lines are combined with others in order to move things along more quickly.  Nothing seriously damaging to the essence of the story.  The animation I think is quite well done, given its age, and the voice actors are generally quite good.

The negative:  I feel as if the move is too short (barely over 90 minutes) to really do the book justice.  The book's main plot is somewhat slow to develop, but this works quite well, because you come to understand, as you are reading, each of the characters and why the rabbits are making the decisions that they make.  Each rabbit has his or her own distinct personality, and each are well-developed.

The movie, in my view, just moves too quickly to capture these nuances.  The rabbits in the movie were very one-dimensional, and several significant characters in the book are omitted altogether.  For instance, all of the stories about El-Ahrairah (save one, mentioned at the very beginning of the movie) have been removed.  I completely understand why this was done:  they aren't ""essential"" to the story.  But boy, what a disappointing omission--and, I sure feel that these stories are useful to understand why the rabbits are as they are.  At one point in the movie, my daughter asked me where Prince Rainbow was, and I said that I had no idea.

I was awfully excited to see the movie after having finished the book, but I was disappointed.  The movie isn't bad--it's not.  But it is compromised.  For that, it deserves only three stars.",1488672000,,2053,4.546448087431694

However, while it's rough to watch in spots, and frightening in others, I don't feel like it hurt me as a kid to have seen it. I even went and got the book, to read it, after seeing it as a kid.

832137,5,6304293488,"A beautifully made film that stands the test of time. I can't wait for the new 6-hour-long epic miniseries coming from the BBC and Netflix; but I will always love this original version of Richard Adams's masterpiece. I'll never forget the magic that I felt when the rabbit creation myth introduction (done in a purposefully simplistic style) transitions into a realistic shot of a butterfly landing on a swaying stalk of grass--like a watercolor come to life. Martin Rosen's Watership Down is a classic, and it has some of the best voice acting ever recorded for an animated film: John Hurt as Hazel! Zero Mostel as Kehaar! The great Denholm Elliot! But if you're going to watch the movie, please read the book first. It belongs on the same shelf as The Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series.",1474675200,,800,4.680851063829787

Technically, The animation was very good and the voices were crisp and clear.  I asked my kids, who grew up in the 70s and 80s, and they knew the story well.  Both had read the book when they were school aged, I had heard of the title but never read the book and didn't know the story.  I purchased the movie through amazon and watched just to see what it was about. I'm glad I did.  It is a story told through the challenges faced by a group of rabbits whose lives are turned upside down by the destruction of their homes and their subsequent search for a new beginning with a utopian outcome. I couldn't help but draw parallels to the human condition.  It was written as a childrens story I believe, but the movie at least, is entertaining and thought provoking for adults too.

twice so far, only because there is soooooo much to enjoy and each time I have remembered
something new.  The first time I rented it from the library and it was the last book I listened to on the

832529,4,6304293488,"a beautiful story with much more social commentary than one would expect. Still fun for children though. Seeing it now after all these years I realize that the animation is very dated and that basic production values such as audio levels and editing are a bit sub-par. Once suspension of disbelief takes over and you get sucked into the plight of these characters you will likely no longer see the shortcomings.

It has a very tense storyline and there are some sad (but not traumatic) moments especially for those of us who love animals, but I think it puts the cycles of the natural world in a very appropriate frame that kids will understand.

The animation is breathtaking, looking like water color and and colored pencil.  The resolution is such a stroke of genius, that I still remember my initial reaction to it (one of stunned amazement) this many years after reading it.

For fans of the book who have never seen this adaptation, I will warn you that there are some cinematic differences to the story. However, the essence is kept. I wish that the movie had spent a little more time on stories of El-Ahrairah in the film, as they reflect the main story. The animation is a bit dated, so don't expect a digitally rendered masterpiece. I would not recommend this as a film for younger children to watch.

They chased him through bramble. They chased him through the fields. They could chase him forever. But the bun would not yield.

And some saw her shadow. On the crest of a hill. And the hounds were distracted. Away from the kill.

One day we'll reach a great ocean.... At the end of a pale afternoon. And we lay down our heads just like we were sleeping.... Controlled by the drag of the moon....

We ran through the forests. And we ran through the streams. We ran through the heather. Though we ran in our dreams.

And you were my lover. And I was your beau.... and we ran like the river.... for what else did we know?

One day we'll reach a great ocean.... At the end of a pale afternoon.

And the dogs are all worn out. And the horses all lame. Oh the hunters they're hunted. At the end of the game.

Our love was a river. A wild mountain stream. In a tumbling fury. On the edge of a dream.

And they chased us through the brambles.... And they chased us through the fields. They'd chased us forever. But the heart would not yield.

When the bun has done running.... At the end of the day. I'm ready to answer.... I'm ready to pay

And this river's done running. And my time will come soon.... Carried to the great ocean. By the drag of the moon....

833638,5,6304293488,"This is a review for the 25th Anniversary edition of Watership Down, which was only sold in Australia, and requires a multi-region DVD player.  This edition is loaded with special features, as opposed to the bare bones editions sold in the USA.  If you have a multi-region player, then this is the edition for you.  It is for sale on Amazon in the US, but very hard to find, type the ASIN number in the search and you will be able to purchase it if interested. ASIN B0006B7MLS

The special features are:

Commentary - First up is a Region 4-exclusive audio commentary with Film Threat editor Chris Gore interviewing writer/producer/director Martin Rosen. This is, hands down, one of the best commentaries I have heard this year. While the non screen-specific nature of the commentary might put off some, it's definitely worth sticking with as Rosen imparts a wealth of information. He takes his time answering questions, mainly because of the amount of detail he goes into, and Gore wisely doesn't interrupt. A lot of the commentary's running time is taken up with an account of how difficult the production process was - it sounds as if it is a miracle it got finished at all - which is absolutely fascinating and allows you to appreciate the film on a whole new level. The commentary actually runs slightly longer than the film itself, and ends with still photographs of the duo as they conclude their discussion.

Theatrical trailer - This sinister and slow-paced theatrical trailer is charmingly dated and actually does a very good job of selling the movie and its correct mood and atmosphere.

In production gallery - A collection of 28 black and white photos showing the production team and voice actors working on the film.

Premiere night gallery - Four black and white photos from the premiere night, including a couple of shots of director Martin Rosen hob-nobbing with Prince Charles.

Cast & crew biographies - Biographies are included for author Richard Adams, voice actor John Hurt, director Martin Rosen and senior animators Tony Guy, Philip Duncan, Arthur Humberstone and George Jackson.

Rabbit religion - This collection of extracts from the novel provides a decent explanation of the beliefs of the rabbits in the movie. Their vision of how the world was created is quite fascinating and is actually more believable than those of most ""real"" religions.

Real Watership Down images - Some text is provided detailing the area on which Richard Adams based Watership Down, followed by 12 colour photographs of the various locations he used for inspiration, comparing them to backgrounds from the film.

Rabbit words glossary - An invaluable source of information for those who have not read the book, this section gives explanations for all the unusual words the rabbits in the film use. In actual fact, not all of the terms presented here are used in the film itself (they seem to have been carried over from the definitions given in the novel), but nonetheless this is quite an interesting glossary.

Bright Eyes loop - This allows you to practice driving yourself insane by playing the Art Gurfunkel song from the film (together with the accompanying animation) on an infinite loop.",1410652800,,3200,4.925650557620818

833732,4,6304293488,"I read the books. Loved them. I own this movie and love it as much as the books. Though, the movie is a very 'abridged' version of the story. The animation is simply beautiful. The characterization of the the rabbits, other than Pipkin, he's supposed to be a child, they have an older male voice for him, are perfect.

I do recommend you read the books. Watership down and Tales from Watership Down to get a clear vision of the story.

And, if you can track down copies, find the Watership Down television series. There are 3 seasons (39 episodes). They go into further details and introduce more characters from the books, such as Hannah the mouse, Silverweed, the other mystic rabbit, Strawberry, from Cowslip's warren, who follows our heroes and joins them at the down. They also touch on Captain Campion, Woundwort's captain of howsler. You see more of him and his ultimate struggle between doing what's right and staying loyal to his chief. Much like the movie, they don't dumb down the violence. Though, it's not as vicious and bloody as the movie.

833809,5,6304293488,"Be warned that this Blu-Ray is pressed for region B (Europe and other countries not including the US). This means that unless your player is region free or from the region where it was pressed (B), you won't be able to play this disk. However, if you can play this BD movie, the video quality is quite good for a 1978 animated film. However, it really didn't get quite the highest quality remastering care that's needed for a film like this.

Though, considering this BD edition appears to be the only Blu-Ray edition on the market, we're kind of stuck until Universal re-releases a Blu-Ray for North America. Because of the region issue, you have to understand this limitation and may have to play the movie in a computer BD drive of which computer owners can get region free software. With standalone players, you'll have to search for one that's region free.

This movie has drama, action, and a purpose. The way it is told is old school leaving some people feeling bored. This is what I experienced showing it to a friend.

833916,5,6304293488,"Both me and my then 9 years old daughter we LOVED this 1978 British animated film, which can be watched with interest not only by children by also by adults. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Adapted from a children book (which I didn't read), this film begins in a comfortable rabbit warren somewhere in English countryside. In this story rabbits live in very well organized societies, with always a Warren Chief at the top of the hierarchy and a standing army/police force, called Owsla, to preserve peace and chase away intruders.

One of the rabbits in this particular warren, a certain Fiver, is a seer - and he just had a terrifying vision which makes him urge the Warren Chief to abandon their homeplace and look for a new one. But as he is a kind of a runt-of-the-litter the chief refuses his advice - very bluntly. However Fiver's big brother Hazel, a very noble character, believes him immediately and so do some of their friends and relatives: Blackberry, Pipkin, Dandelion, Silver, Violet (the only girl) and last but not least a particularly huge and fierce rabbit warrior named Bigwig. Together they abandon their warren and go in exile, searching for a new home. And then the film really begins...

This is an exceptionally good film, slightly similar in tone and at the same extraordinary level as the ""Secret of NIMH"" - although here the drawing style is different and frankly, for my personal taste, BETTER than in this great American classic. It is also suprisingly serious for a kids movie, with elements of rabbit warfare and religion included. Younger children will probably not understand it at all.

PARENTAL WARNING: there is at least one scene which is absolutely NIGHTMARISH (it actually made me shudder - and I haven't been a child for a long time now) and also please be warned that some characters die a rather ugly and violent death in this film - and I am not talking here about bad guys... For all those reasons I would really NOT let children younger than 7 watch it...

21 years later, in 1999, there were also 39 episodes TV series made based on the same story, but it was more kids friendly, with only the last episodes becoming darker and more serious. I watched only a couple of episodes, but my daughter, who went through almost oll of them, definitely preferred the original film.

That being said, I found this film EXCELLENT. Actually, you don't really need to watch it with children - adults, especially those who are into fantasy and SF (like me) can find this film a very, very interesting and very pleasant thing to see. I certainly did. ENJOY!",1401926400,,2617,4.703056768558952
833917,5,6304293488,"I was expecting a children's film, but it was not. I rented it because I thought it was one of those classic animated films and it is indeed.

833995,4,6304293488,"Watership Down is the story of a quest for a promised land that begins in a threatened rabbit warren. Prophetic weakling Fiver convinces his brother Hazel and a band of young bucks that they must strike out on a dangerous journey to avoid an unknown horror.  Skepticism and doubt plague the travelers, but the Hazel's leadership and Fiver's wisdom seem to win the day. But then they face a new challenge from one of their own kind- the powerful leader of a rival warren. Can Hazel's leadership and clever tricks save them?
The script for this beautiful, traditionally-animated flick was whittled down from the weighty novel of the same name, and preserves only one of the rabbits' legendary tales of El Ahrairah, which inspired their courage and perserverance against all odds. But it still got the main story right. The rabbits are animated in a near-realistic style, over gorgeous watercolor and pastel backgrounds depicting real English countryside.  The voices are fine and the score, with the Art Garfunkle hit song ""Bright Eyes,"" is wonderful. There are some good behind-the-scenes extras. My only caveat is that potential viewers should be aware that the film has some pretty gory fight scenes and a snare scene, with realistic flows of blood, that might upset the sensitive or younger viewer.",1395532800,2,1300,5.013888888888889

I'm still awestruck by the animation, perhaps even more than I had been as a child, but now the story has a much greater impact. Richard Adams wrote the tale for his children (which some may find hard to believe) because he was unimpressed with the selections available to them at the time. He delivered a story of such character, sincerity and depth, it's easy to forget you are watching rabbits! One of my very favorite movies of all time, and although it is somewhat violent, I think it teaches some very valuable lessons on morality, equality and fighting for what you believe in.

834115,4,6304293488,"Watership Down is an adult animated film from 1978. It is based on the novel by Richard Adams.

This is a unique looking animated film. It is absolutely NOT for kids. It is violent and gory, and it has a deep complex storyline and lots of talking.

The movie starts off with a strange animated sequence explaining to us that the world and it's animals were created by a god called Frith. The animals lived happily, but soon the rabbits began to multiply, and Frith warned the Prince of rabbits named El-ahrairah to find ways to control his people, otherwise he will. When El-ahrairah makes an egotistical comment, Frith is angered and wants to get the better with him. He blesses each animal, making them all different. Then he creates the fox, dog, cat, hawk, and weasel, and many of the rabbits get eaten by them. Frith then blesses El-ahrairah's tail, which turns him into a swift rabbit with big feet. He then tells the Prince ''all the world will be your enemy, Prince with a thousand enemies. And whenever they catch you, they will kill you, but first they must catch you''.

The scene then cuts to a beautiful and unique animation style which goes on for the rest of the film. We are introduced to rabbits named Hazel and Fiver. Fiver acts rather strange, and while they are eating, Fiver has a scary vision of the field covered in blood. When he snaps out of it, he feels that there is evil all around them, and he tells Hazel they must leave the warren immediately. They have to leave because there will be tractors that will ruin the field and kill the rabbits. We are then introduced to Bigwig, who directs them to the Chief rabbit, but the Chief doesn't feel that they should leave during mating season.

Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and several other rabbits decide to secretly leave anyway. Throughout the film, the rabbits try to find the perfect place to settle, but they meet many dangers along the way.

I really like this movie. I find the story is really interesting and the main characters are all unique and likable. This is a really good film, but it isn't for everyone. Some scenes are truly horrifying for an animated film. There is also a gory fight scene near the end. All in all, this is a really good and unique animated film for adults.",1374019200,,2259,4.526960784313726

834332,4,6304293488,"Watership Down is an unsettling exercise in glorifying death and violence disguised as a kids film. It is very disturbing thanks to some surreal imagery that is mindbending and chilling. It is hard to forget the overall disturbing atmosphere, that is bleak, morbid and dark throughout. The story revolves around bunny Fiver who sees visions of a black rabbit, death personified, and believes they must leave their warren before they are destroyed. He manages to convince a few and they escape. The rest of the warren are destroyed by man, the real enemy of the film, who digs up the warrens with excavators, made to look like carnivorous monsters. There are surreal scenes of bunnies trying to escape their holes but they are blocked by dead bunnies in the entrance, blue and red eyed, a most unsettling sequence.

Fiver leads the intrepid bunnies to the big big water where they meet an obnoxious seagull who swears and makes a lot of loud noise. They travel to a warren where there are a lot of other bunnies that seem strangely brainwashed, almost like a cult. They are being fed enormous amounts of food but Fiver senses they are going to be killed and are being fattened up like trapped lambs led to the slaughter. He is right, and the rabbits escape but there is a nasty encounter with a trap that causes blood and foam to drool down the mouth of the victim. They encounter one death struggle after another and everytime Fiver sees the black rabbit he knows one of them will be killed. We see bunny after bunny slaughtered, by car, by hawk, and by ravenous dogs.

""There's a dog in the woods"" says Fiver ominously and a massive black dog mutilates one rabbit after another. It revels in the kill and has no mercy. It is the only animal that doesn't talk giving it a more sinister appeal. A cat catches one bunny and says sardonically ""Can you move, I think not, I think not."" The unremorseless slaughter of the innocent is horrifying but the theme of the film is that the bunnies will have many enemies as Frith (rabbit god) intended, as a form of punishment. But the rabbits are given gifts of enormous speed and agility so that it can survive ""digger, runner, swift of foot, prince of a thousand enemies"". And the narration makes it perfectly obvious this will be leak in the first scene, ""when they catch you they will kill you.""

The film is blessed with an amazing song ""Bright Eyes"" by Paul Simon that is haunting and beautiful. The film clip that went with this featured many of Fiver's visions and it all made sense at the time. I saw this movie at the cinema and it certainly had an impact on my teenage mind. I thought about it often and my sister became obsessed with it, reading the novel, drawing the rabbits and buying a very lavishly illustrated book of the film.

Overall, this is an enjoyable film made back before political correctness and severe censorship. Along with `Felidae' and `Plague Dogs' it is hailed as one of the more disturbing animated `kids' films. As such it is a real oddity that will entertain, but it is not really for kids. They can watch with parents of course but the nightmarish scenes may have a negative long lasting effect.",1343433600,3,3173,4.580985915492958
834333,5,6304293488,"Technical rating first; I'd give the DVD quality 4 stars.  The picture is great, the widescreen aspect is wonderful for someone who's been stuck watching the fullscreen VHS for the last couple decades.  The sound is an issue; be ready to pump up the volume to make out some of the quieter dialoge.  For some reason a lot of older animated films converted to DVD seem to have this problem, so it may be something they just can't avoid.  But, it makes it less than perfect so 4 stars is fair.

Now, the film itself.
This is (in my opinion) the best mature animated film ever made.

While little kids may be mildly interested in the rabbits, the majority of the film will bore them to death.  The blood and violence (which is mild compared to most of today's video games) are nothing compared to the social-political message and heavy character development/progression that little kids just won't be able to get.  Don't torture them by telling them to be quiet while watching it because it's a ""cartoon"".

Teens and up should absolutely see this movie.  And, then see it again two or three times to pick-up on all the different topics covered.  Then, when you have a bad day or week and need a reminder that sometimes the good guys win, pop this in, skip to the end, and cheer on Hazel and BigWig.

I have recommended and promoted this film since my high school days, and I have gotten some interesting feedback.  A fellow Christian once told me they didn't like the idea of rabbits having a sun god.  A fellow conservative once told me they thought it was a pro-hippie movie.  An atheist told me they thought it was a pro-judeism movie.  A liberal told me it was an anti-socialism movie.  And a PETA member friend told me she thought the film was an anti-rabbit movie (and that one totally boggled me).

Any film that produces this many totally contradictary view points has to be worth a watch, right?

Here's my nutshell of ideas I think Watership Down suggests or promotes:
There's a Creator, They've given us some good things, and They are worth acknowledging even if They don't fix things when we ask Them to.
Love your family and never close your mind or heart to them.
Sometimes you have to trust in something that your peers consider crazy to save your own tail.
Comfort and safety are not always the same, and the easier something seems, the more dangerous it might be.
The toughest individual in a group is not always the best leader.
The smartest individual in a group is not always the best leader.
The one who wants to be the leader is often not the best leader.

And one really odd one:
Death (personified) isn't always the bad guy.

If you are an adult and haven't seen this film, I strongly urge you to do so.  If you don't like animals, then you may have difficulty accepting talking rabbits as characters.  Just think of them as people.  But I can't think of anyone who would not benefit from watching this film because it will make you think on many levels.",1339718400,11,2974,4.495344506517691

834337,4,6304293488,"Watership down is not for everyone.  It's not for small children, though I think intelligent young teenagers could take a lot from it.  It is not simply a 'cartoon.'  The story is an allegory along the lines of the old brother's Grim tales, and anyone who has read the originals knows they are not pleasant little fairy tales.

Watership down is a tale of social structures, of leadership, and hard choices.  It is cloaked in the guide of a grup of rabbits seeking a new home, but the parallels to human life (and English life at the time of the book's writing) is unmistakable, with main character each representing an archetype from the time period(with the exception of Hazel who is the template protagonist trying to define himself)

the Art direction is magnificent in this film, though might throw someone off as all artsy movies have the ability to do when they clash with personal taste.  But it's coherent, and strong.  All in all this is a good movie, not to be missed, but please go into it with the proper mindset or you will be sorely disappointed.",1331596800,4,1061,4.6063829787234045
834448,5,6304293488,"I was really pleased to find this movie in DVD form, as the book is one of my favorites. This adaption is very well done, keeping as close as possible to the original novel, and I'm really glad I bought it.

The animation on the rabbits in general is very good for the year it was made, but the real moments where this story shines are in the dark fantasies, delusions and flashbacks of the lapin protagonists. I'd be hard-pressed to find a more beautifully disturbing sequence in ""animal cartoons"" than the explanation given by one rabbit of how the old burrow was plugged up, and how the rabbits within suffocated- as we see the shades of these rabbits dig madly against each other towards the light they will never see, stylized and terrifying, you are shaken by how a story about bunnies can move you to a state of mental unrest.

That being said, aside from that one sequence, there is much here to enthrall any lover of the book or anyone interested in animation, or simply a story told well. Everyone in my family approved this movie, which is rare- we are quite the picky group.

Keep in mind, though: This movie is not something I would show to anyone under the age of, say, eleven or twelve. It is violent, occasionally extremely disturbing, sometimes nightmarish, and usually over the head of anyone under that age.

Awesome drawn/painted backgrounds that look so realistic. The music is also gorgeous, very sad at times, set the grim mood for the film throughout. Overall, for a film that came out in the late 1970's, it was ahead of it's time. The ending is one of the saddest yet beautiful conclusions I have ever seen. And the first time I saw the film was on HBO in 1980, at five years of age, and have admired it in very high regards ever since.

Just the original movie poster itself sets the tone. It shows Bigwig slowly being choked to death by a snare. Again, nature vs. man. Could you imagine Disney or Pixar trying to release a movie poster, or even a film like this today? Nope, the new wave of Puritanism parenting that is all over the USA would never let it happen. Yet, Watership Down is so much more deeper of a film than 95% of the computer made eyesores currently in theaters today.

834633,1,6304293488,"Having first read the book, which was a fantastic story with lots of social relevance and an overall rich and complex story, the movie was a sorry disappointment.  The quality of animation was really not the issue, as I didn't have a high expectation anyway and it was adequate, but the sound transfer was awful and was practically made the whole thing unwatchable.  The pitch and tones went from so quiet you couldn't hear, to blaringly loud (like an unwelcomed loud commercial).  I kept having to adjust the volume...and I was in a quiet room.  If you've heard the old saying that you shouldn't really be ""aware"" of the music, this one failed miserably at that.  The music so distracted and blared out so loud as to distract from anything going on and sometimes made it hard to hear the dialogue.

Not to say all Brits are stuffy, but most of the script/screenplay was read in the stereotypical British aristocratic style---stodgy, stuffy, and boring, somewhat like a barrister would have read it.  Some of the parts seemed more like they were reading a dictionary, , instruction manual, or legal document or like they were narrating a documentary than a dramatic story. The voices just never quite felt right and lacked any serious dedication to empathy, feeling or excitement.  They added nothing to the story.

Also, the cutting out of a great many sub-plots and societal points (as pointed out by a number of reviewers) really took away from the meaning of the book and thorough story-telling of the original novel.  Pretty much, it was watered down into an animated story about bunnies escaping a farmer to get to a safe place. That's it. The original story carries valuable social dialogue and stories, whereas there's nothing of value here if you're over about 3 years old...really.

I would hope that someone someday does a revisit to this story and gets it right. This adaptation is simply terrible...and thus I revised my rating from 2 to 1 star.

As for me, I got this at the library free and am very glad I didn't have to pay for this.  I would have felt a bit ripped off.  This one is strictly for the little kiddies, as all adult content has pretty well been water-shipped down.  *Since this review has been up, so many people say it isn't helpful.  I suggest you go and really take a good look at this film and make some comparisons to the book.

834634,4,6304293488,"I saw this at the cinema when it first came out. Interesting atmospheric type of slightly dark and rustic animation, which does justice to the countryside subject matter. And a real adult storyline. It certainly does hold the interest, with a complex story that keeps you wanting to watch. It really gives you an interesting glance into the (possible) life and problems of rabbits. However, it's also pretty harrowing. Now a cartoon can't really be scary like ""Psycho"", or ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", for instance. You know it's only fantasy. But psychologically, symbolically, this movie is pretty blood-curdling. Shadowy images and carefully constructed movements designed to symbolise fearful concepts had me on the edge of my seat at the time, and I do clearly remember having many nightmares featuring characters from this movie as a child. I can think of more ""childish"" or less psychologically draining movies I might have preferred. Still, if you haven't seen it, I do recommend it. Like I say, it's interesting and thoughtful.

Each child may be different, so gauge based on their maturity and comfort level, otherwise you may be dumbing things down needlessly.

My lower star rating of this DVD is not based on the film, which I love, but the transfer.  I own an older edition of the DVD with superior sound and video, despite the bargain basement cardboard-flap case and bad cover art.

However, I can testify that I never had any nightmares about this film!  Then again, I'm a little odd anyway! This movie is more along the lines of Orwell's Animal Farm than Looney Tunes.

834786,5,6304293488,"When Watership Down was published in the early 1970s it immediately struck a chord with readers all over the world.  Some mistook this story about rabbits as ""only a children's book"", forgetting that the best children's stories appeal to discerning adults as well.  When the film based on the book was released in 1978 it also became an instant classic, and it is fortunate that its DVD release was handled so well.

The first thing that strikes the viewer of Watership Down is the intense beauty of the artwork.  The English countryside, with its gently rolling hills and green fields and forests, is evoked so splendidly and carefully that one can almost feel the breezes and smell the flowers and grasses.  The lives of the rabbits are just as lovingly depicted, both the peacefulness of their every day existence and the sheer terror of the battles they fight and the enemies they must confront.  What we must call the ""spiritual"" side of the rabbit's lives: their religious beliefs and their stories of their great hero El-ahrahirah, is also beautifully detailed.  The cast of magnificent voices, led by John Hurt, is impeccable.

834793,5,6304293488,"This is a superb adaptation of a wonderful children's novel of the same name by Richard Adams.  As many others have noted, the tone can be a bit grim, and rather than a story about a bunch of cute little bunnies, it's a sometimes frightening tale of escape from a doomed warren, and another escape from a different warren where things are run along the lines of a police state.  The main characters are heroic archetypes, and the story, animation, and voice-acting performances are all first rate.

One thing that surprises me somewhat is all the reviewers warning that the story may be a bit too dark for some children.  I have to wonder what sort of childhood these reviewers remember having themselves.  Did most of these reviewers not grow up on some of the fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm and others, where tragic things sometimes happened?  Did they not get exposed to Greek and Norse mythology, with all its grimmer aspects, including death?  I think adults sometimes imagine children to be far more mentally and emotionally fragile than they are.  While it's true that there are things in Watership Down that might be dark and even a bit scary for kids, it's really NOT that bad.  I don't think it harms children for them to learn that bad things happen and the world is not all sunshine and roses; indeed, it may be useful for them to be warned of this.  And I saw this movie at the age of 9 when it came out (and some people I know saw it even younger), and neither I nor anyone else I know who saw it was psychologically damaged by the darker aspects of the film.  Good triumphs in the end.  The dark and threatening things in the film are overcome by the courage, resourcefulness, loyalty, and heroism of the protagonists, and that, I think, is something that's good for kids to see.",1246233600,6,1797,4.512345679012346

834932,3,6304293488,"Writing a review for this bizarre film poses a few problems.  I mean, do you actually admit to liking this thing when it's title is SO MISLEADING?!  Are you willing to be the target for serious verbal assault from diehard GFR fans who feel they were tricked into buying this video?!  Well, so what if you actually DO like it?!  Don't get me wrong here, my mind was completely boggled when I first viewed it, wondering how in the heck GFR fits in with a documentary film about a bunch of teenyboppers descending on Daytona Beach for Spring Break in 1968!  And from the way these kids look, I'm guessing this was Spring Break 1967.  One thing is for sure, besides the brief footage of Grand Funk Railroad you see, there are absolutely NO HIPPIES in this film whatsoever.  From what I've read, this film was originally called ""Mondo Daytona,"" a documentary of sorts narrated in a lame, hipster, jive monologue by '60s singer Billy Joe Royal (who appears in the film lip-syncing ""Down In The Boondocks,"" a hit song for Royal in 1965!).  Apparently the rights to the film were purchased by GFR's manager Terry Knight in 1970 and footage of the band performing ""Into The Sun"" on a soundstage (in Jan. 1970) was spliced into the film.  This was probably the result of another one of Terry Knight's negotiations to get GFR in the public eye.  So if you want to blame anyone for being mislead, blame him!

HOWEVER, if you like all things '60s like I do, you just might be able to sit through this film and accept it for what it is.  It will definately enlighten you to how things have changed over the past few decades (can you imagine being able to drive your car right up onto the beach and across the sand?).  It also reveals how some things NEVER CHANGE (just as now, kids back then liked to get drunk, hook up, and party).  There's plenty of flesh to gawk at but not nearly as revealing as the modern day trip to the beach, but let's leave a little something for the imagination shall we?

The film has some pretty ""swinging"" moments, interviews with the various beach going teens revealing their insight on what makes Spring Break fun (and the relation to the opposite sex in the process).  There is a hilarious late night dance party montage, with proof that kids couldn't dance back then either!  The few musical performances featured, besides GFR, actually fit the film's theme.  The Swingin' Medallions are on the beach doing their 1966 hit ""Double Shot Of My Baby's Love"" (a frat house rocker perfect in any decade).  The Tams are seen on a houseboat singing ""What Kind Of Fool"" (probably a favorite of soul buff Mark Farner from Grand Funk).  However there is a ridiculous video segment for Joe South doing ""Hush.""  Billy Joe Royal concludes the film by sitting on a sand dune and singing a song.

This film is rambling, goofy, oddball '60s fun and that's how it needs to be approached in order to be enjoyed.  Grand Funk's performance is the highlight except for the fact that the audio track is SO off sync with the video that near the end, Mark Farner's Messenger guitar is somehow able to play itself while Mark holds it over his head with one hand!

The intro almost had me turning the thing off--happily the animation improved once the ""legend"" was all through.  My problems with this film--it barely skims the surface of the depth of story found in the book.  We never see how Hazel and Bigwig at the start are at odds re. who should be chief rabbit.  We spend perhaps what seems, oh, the span of one morning in the warren of bones and snares--in the book the rabbits stayed there for many days at least.  We don't have Strawberry (I believe that was his name) from that same warren follow after our heros depart (after Bigwig escapes the snare), to join them.  We don't see that Clover and others of the hutch rabbits do manage to escape and join Hazel's group.  We never see the little mouse Hazel befriends--one of my favorite scenes in the book, or how that leads up to Hazel's idea to befriend other animals living on the hill--and the eventually befriending of the seagull.  We never see how long Bigwig stayed at Gen. Woundwart's (sp?) warren, how difficult it was for him to get to the point he could organize an escape.  We never see the doe who hurt her back jumping into the boat, die, and worst of all and in my opinion the other never sees were forgiveable, but not this--we never see how Hazel escapes the cat, we never see him go for the car ride that takes him back to the warren.  The other thing we never see that I would have liked to see--after Woundwart's (sp?) death we never see the joining of the two warrens--Hazel's vision, and how that comes true.

835074,5,6304293488,"If you loved the book, you will love the movie.  If you've never read the book, you're in for a pleasant surprise.  Rabbits?!! you say.  Yes, rabbits - but we are not talking Disney bunnies, here, or Warner Brothers wabbits, either.  These rabbits are people, with a rich and carefully thought-out culture and history and language and mythology of their own, and even in the movie they manage to weave all this rich supporting material seamlessly into the story.

Which reminds me: first let me get this ""Family Entertainment"" designation out of the way.  This isn't really a story for very young children, at least, not for children whose parents feel they still need to say ""went to sleep"" instead of ""died,"" because, well, the rabbits in the story are realistic in EVERY way, and deal with death on a daily basis.  (It's not easy being small and edible!) But if you (or your children!) have no problem with movies like ""The Lord of the Rings,"" or ""The Last Unicorn"" etc, then this really is Family Entertainment, because it is definitely intelligent and thoughtful enough for adults, as well.

Speaking of ""LOTR,"" I have Watership Down (the book, that is, on which this movie is based) shelved right beside it on my shelf of ""Top Novels IMHO of All Time"" because of the depth of character and timeless themes such as courage, loyalty, honor, kindness, the victory of the small over the powerful and evil, etc.  I was very pleased to find that the movie truly does it justice and sticks quite close to the source material.

This is not high-tech animation, mind you, but there's something very beautiful and touching about the watercolor mattes that remind me of old botanical prints.  The animation of the rabbits is amazingly realistic, too - the animators clearly studied real rabbits very closely.  There are times when they come a bit too close to making the rabbits' faces themselves a bit too cute, though (or too human-cartoon-ugly, in the case of the ""bad guys"") but on the whole I was relieved at the lack of cartoonishness.  I'm not sure a more modern form of animation would be an improvement.  (But what do I know?  I thought the Lord of the Rings was unfilmable, at one time, too!)

The sound-track is good, too.  Haunting and bittersweet.  The brief bit of ""Bright Eyes"" sung by Art Garfunkle brings tears to my eyes every time - it alone is worth the price of the movie.

Speaking of Bright Eyes, the Deluxe Edition of the DVD, besides having nicer picture quality, contains two commentaries and a storyboard-to-screen comparison.  The commentaries are marginally interesting and storyboards are always hard for anyone but true film buffs to watch for more than a few minutes.  But it is kind of interesting to learn the history of Art Garfunkle's feelings about singing ""Bright Eyes"" (He hated it!  Go figure!)",1221609600,4,2829,4.754098360655738

That leads them to Efrafa, a militaristic warren under the ferocious claws of the gigantic General Woundwort.  He is drawn pretty scary and the little tykes might find him a wee bit frightening.
Some of the rabbits have distinct personalities.  There's Hazel the strategist and nominal leader of the group, Fiver the visionary, Bigwig, a tough rabbit and fighter who's their muscle, Pipkin, the small and chubby fearful one, Dandelion the storyteller (who unfortunately doesn't get a chance to tell a story here), Blackberry the clever one, whose ideas save them more than once, and Silver, who's a larger rabbit whose presence seems to give them security.  One character that was never in the book is Violet, a doe, who unfortunately meets a tragic end, and her death has great consequences later on.
It's virtually impossible to replicate Richard Adams' masterpiece on an animated level, but producer Martin Rosen and his team try.  The rabbit societies and their different outlook is made apparent.  There's the authoritarianism of the wanderer's home, the deceiving, untraditional Cowslip's warren, and the cruel militaristic totalitarianism of General Woundwort's warren, Efrafa.  Hazel's group is more democratic and the best way to live, as is the vision Fiver has of where they should be:  ""A high lonely place with dry soil where we can see and hear all around, and men hardly ever come.""
The animation is splendid, the rabbits made believable, such as the heroes.  The types of eyes play a difference here.  The heroes eyes seem normal, while the narrow eyes of Cowslip's rabbits give them a sense that they're a bit weird, and the dark circles around those in Woundwort's sociey give the officers a cruel look, and the others an oppressed look.
A more lyrical set of sequences is given when we get an insight into how Fiver gets his visions.  But the image where a warren is destroyed by men is pretty disturbing.  From the latter, this movie is not for the younger kids, as there are some frightening and violent scenes.  Maybe junior high onward.
And some of the Lapine language terms are used here without explanation, so I'll include them here:
flayrah - very good food, e.g. the carrots at Cowslip's warren
Hlessi - a solitary rabbit not part of a warren
Hraka- rabbit word for excrement, also used as a swear word
hrududu- a motor vehicle
inle - death.  Frith and inle is kind of like ""Oh my god."" in rabbit language
Lendri- a badger
Owsla- the officer class in a warren, in charge of defense and security.
-rah - a suffix meaning prince or a token of respect. e.g. Hazel-rah
silflay - feeding time
Tharn - going tharn means rabbits are going stupefied from fear
The voice actors do well in bringing personalities into the rabbits, especially John Hurt (Hazel), Richard ""Good Neighbours"" Briers (Fiver), Roy Kinnear (Pipkin), Michael Gruber-Fox (Bigwig), and Harry Andrews (Woundwort), but it's Zero Mostel's over-the-top Yiddish schitck as Kehaar that surpasses them all.
Rabbits.  Prolific, hunted by humans, an invasive species, to use the ecological term, but they are animals.  The glory and triumph of the rabbit can be summed up in Frith's (the sun and God to the rabbits) message to El-ahrairah, the prince of rabbits:  ""All the world will be your enemy, prince witha  thousand enemies, and when they catch you they will kill you.  But first they must catch you, digger, runner, prince with the swift warning.  Be cunning and full of tricks, and your people will never be destroyed.""

Never has movie affected me to the extent that Watership Down did.  Why?  Several things but in particular the rabbit's quest for freedom and to escape an evil communist regime.  The rabbits cared for each other and some paid the ultimate price in their quest for freedom.  And Hazel, played by John Hurt,(I call him chest buster; think of a Sci-fi film from '79 and you'll know what I mean) gave of himself unselfishly to help his fellow lovers of freedom.  They had so much against them but they never gave up.  Perhaps some of this generation's children should see this movie to help them appreciate what our forefathers went through coming to to what is now the U.S.A.
The DVD transfer is extremely good.  The audio (although has quite a bit of analog ""tape hiss"") has a lot of dynamic range.  That along with the gorgeous score makes the DVD complete.  The print wasn't flawless but most likely the best it's ever looked in a home video presentation.  Maybe the production master was one also used for a laserdisc transfer. I doubt this was a special transfer for DVD.
I love the score so much that I edited down audio from the movie and burned a CD of it to play in my truck.  I simply cannot get enough of the music.  If the soundtrack CD ever comes out, I'll buy it.
You must see this movie.  It will move you and probably inflict a little pain at the same time.  Best of all, it's not politically correct.  Also any child that's at least 7 or 8 should be able to handle this movie.  This movie also made me start looking out for rabbits while driving.",1018742400,7,1594,4.389078498293515

However, you must understand that rabbits in real-life are not the Thumpers in Walt Disney's Bambi, but wild animals who strive to survive in their world. Also, Richard Adams based his information on a book written by a friend of his who studied the lives of the English rabbit.
The book and movie are both beautiful pictures of the rabbits and how they live. There are some mythical elements, which add a whimsical and dramatic air to the novel and is on par with anything written by my beloved Tolkien.
I don't think children should be prevented from seeing this film, but be warned that it does realistically potray rabbits being wounded and killed. There is even blood, but it isn't a splatter-fest like in a B-rated horror flick.

Don't be fooled into thinking just because it's and animated feature about rabbits that this film will be suitable for younger kids, it is NOT.  Watership down has quite graphic representations of brutality and death.  Putting those facts aside it does tell a compelling story about a band of refugees looking for some place to resettle and live their lives out in peace.  It just happens that the refugees are rabbits.
This is a story of survival.  It is a mature story told in a make believe way.  It is told with an edge of realism that contradicts the candy coating of the animation and character species.  I just bought a copy of this so my wife and I could watch it.  Melanie (My wife) having not seen it before and not knowing what to expect was left speechless when Violet was gone.

That being said, I've ben watching Watership Down since before I can remember, and although I found some sections scary, in general I was wrapped up in the totally convincing world of the rabbits. The Animators and writers have created a literate, honest and beautiful film, where friends may die because of enemies who can be confronted but equally because sometimes the world is like that. ""All the World will be your enemy"" says the sun God in the creation Myth which opens the film, and it is evident throughout that the rabbits do indeed live perilous lives. But rather than taking it, they fight back with cunning and tricks, thay confront their fate and chose a new path. This solid, positive message is well told in a believeable world of totalitarian dictatorships, prophecies, myths, fatalistic aristocrats, german seagulls, cats, foxes and dogs.
  As for the animation, it is not perfect, but captures the mood of the film, and created rabbits who move like rabbits, not like small hairy people. There are some truly disturbing hallucinagenic sequences, and some beautiful ones, notably the accompliment to ""Bright Eyes"". The high and lonely places, misty mornings, oppressive forests and sweeping countryside are beautifully realised, and give a coherent setting for the events of the story.

As a child who grew up in the early 80's on the Discovery channel, and epsiodes of The Trials of Life in the 90's, I understood death.  I do not feel this movie should be hidden from young children.  I think they need movies like these to keep them real.  Forget about the Disney movies that show us everything is alright in the end.  Children will love this movie and the images of it will stay with them at least until adulthood, since I am now 20 and recently re-watched this classic.  I hadn't seen it in about 10yrs and felt the need to share the experience with a friend who was simply speechless at what he saw.  Okay, so my parents thought I was nuts for loving this movie so much as a child and always jumping up and and down at the video store to rent it.  They thought it was too scary, but I'm so happy they never decided to get up and turn the video off (back then there were no remotes for VCRs).  I can't imagine childhood w/o Watership Down and The Secret of Nimh who's dark story telling give children a break from sudsy bubble gum Disney movies.  (Except for the wonderful end scene in Sleeping Beauty, which others might also see as too scary for children).  My point is, although the animation in these movies wreaks of the 80's limitations, there is something about this mode that aides the animator in leaving their mark.  Creating some powerful, memorable images that last for decades.  Don't deny you child this.  I believe these movies started my appreciation to crave something more in a movie and a book than fun and a happy ending, but to crave stories with challenges and myths, death and sadness...In other words, something real.",1005091200,3,1832,4.375739644970414

The characters are distinct, with both strengths and weaknesses, like real people. The good guys have bad points about them, as the bad guys have good points. True, you can tell who the villains are, but you can also see that they are often justified, and are doing what they believe is the right thing.
The only complaints are a few parts where the rabbits and their environment seem out of proportion, and the snare scene wasn't quite done as realistically as it could have been done. When I watched that scene as a young child, it lead me to thinking that being choked too long makes you puke up blood. ^_^
But there were so many good points, and the animation was so realistic and beautiful, that those are merely tiny stones in an otherwise wonderful road. And the music was absolutely gorgeous and tear-jerking. Absolute poetry. The surrealism created an atmosphere of emotion I have yet to see equal to.
At first I was skeptical; Rabbits cant be that savage or strong I thought. But then I got a netherland dwarf rabbit, and he was one savage little beast. He tore me and my family's arms up (I still have scars) and he kicked and bit our two cats and male Doberman into submission! He was too wild to keep so we let him loose in the woods, and half a year later my dad found him as the leader of a big group of wild rabbits! They wouldnt run away from my dad until my rabbit stomped, and he let him get super close. He was tiny but had them all under his power.

While I considered it to be a good animated movie, I was  disappointed by the apparent lack of true drama. With Watership Down,  however, we get something powerful. While I don't consider mindless  violence to be drama, here the violence actually works because it  represents the hardships these rabbits have to endure. Everybody acts  realistically, and everybody makes the experience enjoyable, especially the  haunting Fiver. And with this movie, you can't actually say the animation  is bad because the surrealistic quality makes the movie that much more  haunting. It just wouldn't be the same if the movie didn't have the  bleeding fields or Captain Holly's nightmare or the sad but powerful  ""Bright Eyes"" sequence. While uninitiated adults won't want to  see an animated movie, and this is certainly not a movie for kids, those  that have seen this movie have seen something, in my opinion, epic and  powerful and genuinely sad. The ending is also something very different,  neither a happy one nor a sad one. That is something you won't see in any  Disney movie, with the possible exception of The Fox and the Hound. Truly a  gem of an animated movie. I consider Watership Down to be the anime of  western animation, and it is many times better than most anime movies I've  seen.",967939200,16,1379,4.84549356223176
835615,5,6304293488,"A simply awesome animated film based on Richard Adams's great novel in which the lifes of rabbits are used as an allegory for Human society,  Watership Down tells the tale of a group of rabbits who's home is about to  be detroyed and how they must find a new place safe from their enemies.  They eventually find a new place, but there are no female rabbits to start  a new burrow. So,  the rabbits go out in search for females and end up  having to fight the dictatorial, rabbit  General Woundwort (voiced by  Harry Andrews). This is probably one of the best  animated film ever  made. Both adults and children will enjoy this. The comic relief is  provided by comedian Zero Mostel (in his last role), as the voice of the  looney Seagull,  Kehaar. The film is full of famed British stars, doing  the voices of various characters,  amongst them John Hurt, Denholm  Elliot and Ralph  Richardson.
Watership Down is a great film that  should endure for a very long time.",967852800,3,966,4.549707602339181

Keep in mind that unlike the rabbits in this film, American Cottontails do not live in  warrens; the rabbits in the movie are English rabbits, like many of our  domestic rabbits.  Lovers of other animals, and plants, of the English  countryside will also enjoy this film. There are a few scenes of blood and  death, hence its PG rating, but these scenes are definitely not overdone.  The plot is far more moving than many other animations, and the music, both  instrumental and vocal, is superb.  If you have not read the book yet, see  the movie first, read the book, which the author, Richard Adams based  partly on the true lives of English rabbits, and see the movie again and  again.",966384000,3,739,4.557251908396947
835618,5,6304293488,"I first saw this movie as a child, then read the book.  Amazingly enough, it is true to the book with little or no ""poetic licence"".  It is not a children's story, however.  It can get quite graphic for the littler  ones.  Still, it is a classic and a ""must have"" for any fan of  '70s cartoon movies.",963705600,,300,4.086206896551724
835619,4,6304293488,"One can only imagine where novelist Richard Adams conjured up his ideas for this intriguing story.  He often said ""Watership Down"" blossomed from the many bedtime stories he told his children.  Regardless,  it is a brilliant introduction for young readers to some of the unpleasent  (as well as pleasent) realities of life.  The book is sensational in how it  establishes an entirely believable world as would be seen and lived by wild  rabbits (albeit rabbits with some very human traits, like intelligence, but  let's not be picky).  This fantasy world is complete with societies based  on organizational structure, discipline, and even religion (there's even a  leporidaen version of Noah's Ark...a real treat!)
Sadly, it is impossible  to make an animated adapation of the novel without losing so many of the  wonderfully unique aspects of the book.  Yet, Martin Rosen does a faithful  job in reconstructing the basic story line so that fans are not likely to  be disappointed.  Children ages 6 and up should be able to watch and enjoy  the film (I first watched it when I was five).  However, I would urge  parents to be present with their youngest to help them understand some of  Watership Down's harsher elements.
The movie's strongest attributes are  its beautiful music (scored by Angela Morley), fine character development,  and the unique animation style of the short story that opens the film.  Less impressive are the editing blunders, such as when the voice of one  rabbit (Silver) is mysteriously replaced with the voice of another (General  Woundwart).  Still, a very fine adaptation.",960854400,6,1601,5.081081081081081

This is one of the great animated  classics, and an example of what we have lost by overuse of computer  animation.  See animation in its purest form in Watership Down.

835622,5,6304293488,"I watched this as a little kid barely able to understand the concept of death, and its consequences, Boy did this movie hurt and bewilder me, after crying my little eyes out I left the movie theater devastated, is this what  happens to all of us eventually, not the way these brave bunnies lived and  died but death it self.  It wasn't until much later (years) that I could  bring myself to watch this ultimately brilliant yet sad movie again, it  broke my heart a second time but I could appreciate the beauty and can now  see how fiction mirrors reality.
This is a tale of Rabbits seeking a  safe new home, we follow their journey in heart wrenching detail, filled  with danger and great sadness, there are some lighter moments that gives  the viewer some emotional relief, but ultimately you are left feeling for  these wonderful characters.
I recommend this movie, warning those who are  first time viewers, if you are expecting a cutesy kiddy type movie then  forget it, Watership Down can be viewed by kids with parental guidance so  they (the parents! as much as the kids) can be comforted when the story  gets too much, keep a box of tissues handy, cause that song BRIGHT EYES  gets me every time I hear it, so be warned.

835623,5,6304293488,"Many people suggest that Watership Down is not for children. I disagree.  Although the message would probably be lost on a child under the age of ten, I think this is an important movie for most kids as it depicts real  life struggles as seen through the eyes of a band of rabbits.  This  particular film is a great way for parents to introduce crucial life issues  to their children in a way they can understand. Most literature and film  tend to underestimate children's capacity for understanding complex issues.  Watership Down book and movie both brilliantly tackle advanced concepts  such as political systems, religion and the environment in a way children  can grasp.  Rarely do you find a children's movie that has the intellectual  content of Watership Down.  Because of some of the violent scenes, I do  suggest that parents watch it with their children in order to answer  questions and address concerns.  I truly love this film.",953164800,27,941,4.867088607594937

It is an autumnal movie, stark and sad, but  somehow very affirming in the end  ( in its, frankly, bleak way).  This is  animation expression at its best, and nothing has topped W Down since.  It  ain't singing animals, so be warned.  But what these animals do is far more  rewarding than a power ballad.  SEE IT!",947721600,7,641,4.313559322033898

On my trip to England, I made it a point to visit Watership Down and Nuthanger  Farm and all the other key locations in the book.  It is so breathtakingly  accurate and I even saw real rabbits hopping around. Luckily, I met someone  on the down who was a personal friend of Adams and was kind enough to  arrange a meeting!  Mr. Adams and his wife are most delightful and were  happy to answer many of my questions. My autographed book is one of my  prized possessions. The story gave me an insight on naturals selection,  death, and the struggle between good and evil. History buffs will love it  for it's relation to communism and democracy.  These are very valuable  lessons to children and this story does it beautifully!  In other words,  that's how wonderful this movie and book are.  While I agree it's not for  everyone, especially small kids, it is definitely a wonderful book for  people wanting an escape from all the fluff of Disney, and who want to be  intellectually stimulated.  I guarantee you will fall in love with the  characters and relate to each one. The subtle references to God, as rabbits  perceive him, are nice touches as well.  Basically, anyone who loves nature  and animals should see this.  I'm a science teacher and I plan to show it  to my students to illustrate ecology and survival of the fittest.  Congratulations Richard-Ra!  You will always be the master storyteller.  Parents review it first before showing it to your little ones.

You see... the violence and the blood may be too  much for some children. You know your children best, and you know what they  can handle. So, make a call accorrding to your experience. Personally, even  at  a tender age, I *knew* that the movie wasn't just about rabbits. I  couldn't quite grasp all of the themes, but I understood the basics. I  think that children really are more capable of understanding than is  sometimes thought. This film is a very good political statement. It isn't  just about humans wrecking the bunny lands. It is about the interactions  between certain groups of rabbits. It's really amazing that Richard Adams  could create such a tale using animals. I highly reccommend this movie to  everybody. Though it isn't intended to give you warm fuzzies, I think that  many people could take something away with them. A family friend bought the  film for her niece thinking that it was going to be a cute movie with  bunnies. Please don't buy the film for your child unless you believe that  your child can handle some violence and heavy themes.  If I hadn't seen the  movie as a young child, I don't know that I ever would have watched it or  read the book. So, I think it is a good thing that I saw it. It all depend  on the child.

I did cry though, at the end, every time...but out of  compassion, not fear. Psychologists and psychiatrists agree that children  form their concepts of death at a fairly young age. I think that Watership  Down illustrates the concepts of death and killing in a safe way (animated  and with animals that would otherwise be considered pretty meak).",943833600,3,513,4.795454545454546
835736,5,6304293488,"This kind of animated film probably wouldn't be made these days (I'm sure many would disagree!), but I believe that is one of the main reasons many of the reviewers who where 8 to 10 when they saw it wouldn't show it to their 8 to 10 years olds... plus the fact that in 1978 every parent would have expected a Disney film of course! :-) Today's cartoons for children are all people shooting at each other with machine guns (or lasers), and no-one getting a scratch... what does that teach about life and the world? That the bad guys always miss and the good guys always win?  That just 'aint true, I'm afraid!
I have to agree with the reviewers who say it's gory in places, but I think parents should show it, and stop if their children find it upsetting, rather than just not show it at all. The first viewing of this film is an occasion (and should be made an occasion!). I assure you your kids will remember it... and they'll also remember that they watched it with you.
I saw the film myself at the cinema when I was nine one afternoon with my father and some likable crazy guy who'd brought along a toy rabbit called ""Tannoy"" which had ""saved his life"" he told me (long story!). I was 9, and had waited years to see it... The film was delayed for a long time due to difficulties behind the scenes, but when it was finally released it was hailed as ""the longest animated feature ever made"", and over 9 months after release was still playing at our local cinemas... beat THAT Disney! :-)
""Watership Down"" is a story of escape from oppression, tyranny and deception, to a freedom won by conflict with those who would take it away by any means necessary, and a leader who earns his place rather than it being given without being deserved.
The films opens with swaying grass at the top of Watership Down, and at the cinema this scene looked so real, that for a moment I thought it was a real film of grass being blown around! Although the art quality drops after the opening titles to a more 'cartooney' look (except for the background art), the film's overall quality never drops. You soon realise you're not watching a kiddie film, and you could just as easily be watching people as rabbits.
The rabbits are not theme-park ""bunnies"" either, but a race with their own language, army, leadership and religion (the book goes into more depth about such matters), and also must suffer under their own oppressors, ineffectual leaders and cruelty towards each other.
The only film that comes close to ""Watership Down"" is Don Bluth's ""The Secret of NIMH"" (another one worth buying if you haven't seen it), and the animated version of ""Animal Farm"" but even those films don't paint darkeness quite so honestly black and bloody as Watership Down!

Obviously, this movie made a lasting  impression on us all.  Just reading the reviews brought back images from my  theater viewing 20 years ago.
To reiterate what others have said, this  is not a film for small children; my two little ones will have to wait  several more years.  Death and killing are topics that are usually avoided  in animated movies, but life and death are part of the adult-oriented  subject matter in this engaging film.  The animation may be somewhat dated,  but the themes of this wonderful story (the longing for freedom and a  better life) are as relevant today as ever.
