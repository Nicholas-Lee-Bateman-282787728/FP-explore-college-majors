It is an important film historically, but also it's just good, clean, amusing fun. And we know it has a happy ending because everyone is celebrating in the beginning.  :o)",984614400,3,273,4.6875
31134,5,0780023099,"When people think of black & white foreign films from the 20's, they inevitably imagine snoozers that are outrageously incomprehensible and  bizarre.  Though they're often right, this movie is here to prove them  wrong.
""Le Million"" is one of a handful of musical comedies  that I'd watch over and over.  The plotline is simple: retrieve a lottery  ticket from a jacket that was given away to a stranger.  Sounds easy,  right?  Not if director Rene Clair has his way!  He adds plot twists,  mistaken identities, disloyal friends, goldigging sexpots, and some pretty  funny slapstick.  Get ready for the most entertaining 90 minutes you've  spent in a long time.  It's interesting to see how many of the actors still  relied on silent film methods of acting (lots of facial expressions and  body language), even though this is a full-fledged ""talkie"".  And  Annabella provides wonderful visual and aural beauty.
The songs are corny  beyond belief but, fortunately, they're few so it's bearable.  The  corniness doesn't make them bad, just hopelessly out of date.  They do help  the story along nicely though, and the new lyric translation helps a lot.  Despite being fluent in French, I had trouble understanding some of the  lyrics, probably due to early recording limitations which occasionally  cause muffled sound during loud passages.  But this is minor and only  occurs during the songs.  Criterion did a wonderful job with the  restoration as a whole.  The print is clear and bright, with only very  small segments showing any wear.  The dialog is easy to understand and is  crisp.
I did have some problems with the subtitles, however.  There are a  few sentences in which they are wildly inaccurate.  And a few of the spoken  ""curse"" words have been translated into much more vulgar English  than necessary.  If there are kids in the room, note that this results in  an essentially PG-rated film.
A DVD that's well worth the small  investment.  You'll own a piece of classic movie history, and it's  tremendously fun to watch.",965174400,17,2033,4.955089820359281

7789443,4,0780023099,"In Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the cinema's great directors and great pioneers, created a gem of light comedy which for all its lightness is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film which clearly influenced subsequent film-makers such as the Marx Brothers, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian. The plot, a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to search frantically all over town for the missing ticket, is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes enacted in a dream world of the director's imagination.

One of the most impressive things about this film is that, though it is set in the middle of Paris and includes nothing actually impossible, it achieves a sustained and involving fairy-tale/fantasy atmosphere, in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they talk, or that a tussle over a stolen jacket should take on the form of a football game. Another memorable element is that Le Million includes what may be the funniest opera ever put on film (O that blonde-braided soprano! ""I laugh, ha! ha!"") Also a delight is the casting: Clair has assembled a group of amazing, sharply different character actors, each of them illustrating with deadly satiric accuracy a bourgeois French ""type,"" so that the film seems like a set of Daumier prints come to life.

The hilarity takes a little while to get rolling, and I found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they can be even in a light comedy (as they are, for instance, in many Lubitsch films.) For these reasons I refrained from giving it the highest rating. But these minor cavils shouldn't distract from an enthusiastic recommendation.

Should you see it? By all means. Highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy.  The Criterion DVD is good quality, though the print could have been better, but I assume they used the best available.",1391040000,,1936,4.857575757575757
7789444,4,0780023099,This film by Rene Clair is very enjoyable and is recommened.  This is paticuarly true for those interested in Rene Clair's career.,1341619200,,130,4.909090909090909
7789445,2,0780023099,"This film is constantly silly, but rarely funny. There are NO likeable characters, as the entire cast is made up of greedy, two-faced philanderers, with no puckish charms to compensate. I spent most of the film hoping that nobody would find the lottery ticket and everyone would die in a fire. I imagine this film was some sort of Depression-era wish fulfillment, but it left me cold and unimpressed.",1260835200,,400,4.811594202898551
7789446,5,0780023099,"The premier edition of the prestigious ""Sight and Sound"" critics poll  of the all-time Top Ten movies came out in 1952 (and every 10 years thereafter another poll is issued).  Coming in a tie for 10th place was Rene Clair's ""Le Million"".  That poll was a bit heavy with silent movies (6 of the 12) and a couple of relatively obscure ""sound"" pictures (""Louisiana Story"" and ""Le Jour se Leve""); make that three obscure sound pictures if you want to include ""Le Million"".  I've generally been impressed with the selections of the magazine's poll and usually I'm able to appreciate what made each movie so special.  In the case of ""Le Million"" I was also able to enjoy the movie.  By that I mean that ""Le Million"" is a fun movie to watch.  It starts out by letting us see a festive party of a large group of celebrants.  They explain why the have all come to celebrate and that leads the story back to earlier that day.  The story unfolds somewhat like a Chaplin film in normal speed with all sorts of comic twists and turns.  Along the way the dialogue varied from individual spoken lines to group chorus.  It could be called a musical but don't let that turn you away if it doesn't sound like your cup of tea.  It's a comedy of errors more than anything else and the beauty of it is we know that, somehow, everything's going to turn out OK (otherwise why were all those people celebrating when the movie started).

I got a kick out of the sets.  There was an art to the backdrops and the lighting that gave a lot of added depth especially in the young lady's apartment.  The many different characters gave a real variety to the cast and they all seemed to have their own role in all the events that unfold.

I admit that this movie gets a 5 Star rating in part because of its' advance reputation.  However, this isn't one of those movies in which we search for brilliance (the number one spot on the 1952 poll went to ""Bicycle Thieves"" which is...well you decide).  This is a movie that delights the viewer and, for perspective, it didn't make the ""NY Times"" best 1000 films list.  It may not have belonged on ""Sight and Sound's"" 1952 list but it certainly could have replaced ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" on the ""NY Times"" list.",1201219200,,2232,4.41320293398533
7789447,5,0780023099,"At the dawn of sound, director Ren Clair brought us this delicious farcical concoction, imbued with a spirited, joyously romantic flavor only the French can produce. It is unalloyed fun to watch the cast of kooks-able performers all-run circles around each other while occasionally bursting into song. The sequence in which Michel and Company make a grab for the coat during a stage performance of ""La Boheme,"" is a highlight. Fresh and timeless.",1125878400,2,446,5.123287671232877
7789448,5,0780023099,One of the most majestic compositions of comedy and musical ever shown in a film. Absolutely hilarious even for today's standards. An explosive plot that builds suspense and romance until the films climatic end. A certain classic!,1099008000,,230,5.243243243243243
7789449,5,0780023099,"Years ago as a graduate student, I was ecstatic to see a faded, fuzzy, and torn copy of LE MILLION at one of the campus film societies.  Nevertheless, I was immediately enchanted.  Luckily, those who today want to see this masterpiece have this magnificently restored version by Criterion.  No one who loves classic cinema will fail to be enchanted by this magical story about the hunt for a lost, winning lottery ticket.
In 1931, the year this film was made, European cinema was just beginning to catch up with the technical achievements made in the United States in the late 1920s.  The period from 1929 to the early 1930s was an extraordinary time, as the art struggled with perfecting the new ability to record soundtracks.  For a brief period of time, the world of cinema was awash with a world of possibilities, and in Hollywood Ernst Lubitsch made perhaps the first lasting musical films in a string of productions (THE LOVE PARADE, MONTE CARLO, and THE SMILING LIEUTENANT by 1931, and later ONE HOUR WITH YOU and THE MERRY WIDOW) that borrowed heavily from the operetta, a form that tragically-based on the extraordinary success achieved by Lubitsch and later Clair and Mamoulian-failed to survive for long.
LE MILLION was essentially an attempt to do in France what Ernst Lubitsch was doing so successfully in Hollywood.  The transition was an easy one, especially given that Lubitsch, the European expatriate, was setting all of his films in Europe.  Rene Clair, however, added many touches of his own.  The humor he employs in the film is laced with a degree of slapstick that simply wasn't Lubitsch's style.  This film is a romp through Paris, and romping wasn't Lubitsch's mode of travel.  LE MILLION is working class, while Lubitsch focused primarily on the antics of the aristocracy, or with workers having to deal with the aristocracy.  Also, while Clair of necessity worked primarily in the studio (the limitations of sound technology required it), he employs some exterior shots that were very unusual for the time.
There is a magic and a delight in LE MILLION that simply cannot be captured in words.  There is something sui generis about a truly great film, especially one that is great in only the way that a film can be great, in the use of camera to tell a story, to tell a joke, to invoke a sense of delight.  Except for those unfortunate film viewers for whom no good film was ever made in black and white, for whom no good film can be subtitled, and for whom an ""old"" film means made before 1970, this is one of those filmed that will be loved and cherished by anyone who loves movies.",1053820800,24,2611,4.712087912087912
7789450,4,0780023099,"This film begins with the ending celebration, so we know that despite all the problems, all will be well. It is a light and frothy film that has nothing really to say. It is fantastic that it has been revived on video for a new generation of film viewers, who perhaps have been blasted too much by violence.
Take the trip to a forgotten Paris and a wonderful fairy tale.",1039737600,3,370,4.3
