4289807,5,B0049GYXFO,"We were blessed with a Level 3 Expression Kit called World of Rhythm and boy does it have a beat! This one comes with a DVD, CD and a board book! Much like our first experience, this is an absolute delight. Both for my daughter (now approaching 19 months) and myself. I'm excited because this is not one of those annoying kid's shows that you put on to give you five minutes of peace, but this is a fun, attractive to listen to, interactive, education device that I can enjoy with her (or get a few minutes of peace in the background).

The board book is the perfect size for her little hands and with rounded edges I'm quite a fan as well. The poetry through out the book plays right into the things she hears while watching the DVD and I love that educational repetition. In the board book there are pictures of real babies as well as the loveable Baby Einstein animals and she is so excited to clap with one page, tweet like a bird with another and then stop her feet on even another. It's priceless to watch her learn and Baby Einstein is really helping us along the way.

I received this free Discovery Kit through a LBi/Baby Einstein program. However, all thoughts and opinions expressed are my own and no other monetary compensation took place.",1298332800,7,1251,4.411255411255412

4289838,3,B0049GYXFO,"After buying it, it discovered that this type of thing does not meet with approval from pediatricians for young children.
We've set it aside for viewing when the kids are older and even then we'll limit the time they watch it. The content is fine; it's the amount of action and extended viewing that alarms doctors.",1388448000,,315,4.642857142857143

They had Baby Mozart, Baby Beethoven, and Animals Around Us and loved them all so I bought several new Baby Einstein DVD's. They love this one.

Therefore, I have absolutely no idea what images are on the screen.  The music is not bad (not as annoying as many others we have).  It still captivates my boys, who are now 19 months old.  They laugh, dance in their carseats and stare mesmerized at the screen.  This is our go-to video and it is not uncommon to play it repeatedly, over and over, on longer rides.  My one and only complaint is that I wish it were longer.",1375228800,,561,4.0

4289878,3,B0049GYXFO,"Before purchasing this, I had been watching the older set of Baby Einstein DVD's from 2004.  I purchased this for my toddler, hoping it would be more about dancing and movement to music--something she could get active with on a rainy day.  It's not.  It's about rhythm and tempo and pitch.  It held my daughter's attention for maybe 10 minutes.  I feel like I wasted the money.  Maybe she'll be interested when she gets older.",1372809600,,426,4.613333333333333

4289881,5,B0049GYXFO,I am so glad I purchased this item.  My grandson and I play music along with the DVD and do our form of dancing for a one year old.  It is so much fun especially since he really loves music.,1369267200,2,190,3.725
4289882,5,B0049GYXFO,"My twins love it.  But only after they were 3 months old.  That's when they appreciated the music and the visuals, esp the puppets.  The video is not long.  Just 25-30minutes but it's long enough to entertain the babies.  Plus they have a couple of shorter versions that they can watch that are between 5-10 minutes in length.",1369094400,,326,4.551724137931035
4289883,1,B0049GYXFO,My daughter didn't enjoy this movie at all. It was music but very slow paced and not energenic enough to keep her attention. She is 14 months and some of the other Einstein movies she loves but this one was a dud,1368489600,,212,4.071428571428571

4289886,1,B0049GYXFO,"Full disclosure - I have not tried any other Baby Einstein DVDs.  This is the first one I ordered and I did so because a friend said her kids loved it.  So maybe it was just my boys, but it didn't even hold their attention for one minute, literally.  It is just a bunch of disconnected animals and scenes with music in the background.  Even I found it annoying.  I have much better luck just putting on an episode of Mickey Mouse Club.

My twin sons are 15 months old, so maybe they are too old for this anyway.  Plenty of people seem to like it, but it was not for us.",1366070400,,569,4.026785714285714
4289887,4,B0049GYXFO,Our grandson like the movements on the TV so this will be perfect and educational at the same time. Can't wait to try it.,1365206400,,121,4.083333333333333

Theres so much movement, it includes videos of animals, toys,  and other babies",1360022400,,245,4.212765957446808
4289890,4,B0049GYXFO,This is perfect! My 11 month old is mesmerized by this video. The music and actions of the children and puppets are perfect.,1359417600,,124,4.434782608695652
4289891,2,B0049GYXFO,"The DVD is what you expect from Baby Einstein which if that's all you hope to get out of it, you'll be pleased.  The board book is useless and contains pages of words that your baby could care less about.  Where's the graphics?  And I don't know how many babies really want to tune into a CD but maybe yours will.  Overall we will get use out of the DVD, but that's it.  Would have appreciated being able to buy these things separately and maybe save a couple bucks.",1358899200,,466,4.191011235955056
4289892,4,B0049GYXFO,"I've been a nanny for many years & rate these DVD's by the reaction of the children I care for.  Currently a five year old and a just two year old. Purchased for viewing by the two year old that loves, loves, loves music and rhythm. If he's given two choices for Baby Einstein DVD's, this is rarely his choice. I don't personally feel the draw to this DVD as one such as Baby Mozart. It's just okay, even with videos like Baby Shakespeare beating this out when given the repetition of choice over time.",1358640000,8,502,4.28421052631579
4289893,3,B0049GYXFO,Although the movie itself is okay my son is just not too interested in it.  I'm not really sure why.,1358640000,,100,4.0
4289894,5,B0049GYXFO,Bought this for my nephew for Christmas and it did exactly was it's supposed to do keep baby entertained and give Mama a few minutes of silence and rest. I watched it as well with him and it's pretty good and entertaining. I can see why babies love these so much.,1358121600,,263,4.176470588235294
4289895,5,B0049GYXFO,I am going to write the same review I gave to the video World Music by Baby Einstein.  We have about 21 Baby Einstein Videos and we like all of them.  My kiddo who is almost 2 years old has been listening to mom play the congas since before he was born.  He likes all musical instruments.  This DVD has a lot of great stuff for kiddos to learn about. This is a great DVD.,1356048000,,371,3.9066666666666667
4289896,4,B0049GYXFO,"I got the Baby Mozart as a gift, and it has been wonderful, truly a lifesaver! My son loved it from the first time. Then I got Baby Beethoven, World of Rhythm and Animals Around Us. All good products, Mozart and Animals would get 5 stars, the other two - 4 stars.",1355529600,7,263,4.076923076923077

4289918,5,B0049GYXFO,"This video by far is my son's favorite!! We have almost every video out there and he can watch this one over and over and never get tried of it. We love the ending to this video, the disco dance off if so fun and cute to watch. He dances right along side the pupphets.",1353369600,4,268,3.890909090909091
4289919,5,B0049GYXFO,"I have bought many baby Einstein DVD for my niece who is now three years old. Some were great and at least two of those she never paid attention to. This show was the first one I bought my 9 month old daughter. I honestly expected a little more in action and more learning. Hey, my daughter doesn't seem to think that way. From day one, she has enjoyed the entire show. That is the only time that not even mom gets attention. This movie also brought me the opportunity of finding a few other things my daughter enjoys. The music is enjoyable and catchy and it is just perfect sin e it doesn't get to be annoying.",1347580800,,612,4.194915254237288
4289920,1,B0049GYXFO,not worth the money as it just has a few picture here and there. well if you like just listening to music and not seeing action then go for it. cause my baby likes listening and watchin the kids dance up and down and not just sounds.i had to return this dvd the very next day cuz it wasn't worth it for me.,1341878400,,306,3.873015873015873

4289922,2,B0049GYXFO,"My son loves these movies. I repeat, he LOVES these movies. The major problem here is that there is no repeat play option. Some of these movies come with it, some without. At out house we have these movies playing all day long, even if we are in another room or he is napping. He barely watches them, but he likes the music while he plays or naps or whatever. The repeat play option is crucial to these movies, and it seems like the newer ones do not have this option. Please baby einstein, please make this a feature on all your movies!!",1337212800,,538,4.233009708737864
4289923,1,B0049GYXFO,"This was so boring and lame that had stock videos of animals and toys ,there was nothing to be learned from this video. The music was also boring my kids would dance to commercials but no movement from this junk.",1330819200,,212,4.325
4289924,5,B0049GYXFO,"My 22 mo old LOVES Baby Einstein!! This isn't her favorite, but it's up there! We tend to spend the day singing, dancing, and banging on things after we watch this video. I love that. :) Get it!!",1320105600,3,195,4.157894736842105
4289925,1,B0049GYXFO,"I would not recommend this product.  It does not capture the ""world of rhythm.""  While the opening is quite nice, it follows the Baby Einstein formula of filmed toys.  Money would be better spent on an actual instrument.",1315180800,,220,4.7368421052631575
4289926,2,B0049GYXFO,"I have quite a few of the older Baby Einstein DVD's that my baby loves.  I got all excited when I saw the commercial for this series with the Beatles song and the baby riding the dolphin.  Well, that was pretty misleading.  It's not bad per se, but it is just the same old footage of animals, puppets, etc.  nothing new or innovative.  Also, there is no ""repeat play"" feature anywhere on this DVD. Anyone who has these, knows its annoying to have baby happily watching only to get her all upset when it stops in 20 some minutes. Babies like repetition!! How do they not know that??  They can leave off every other viewing option because that is the only one I ever use.  Also, its annoying that you can't buy just the DVD.  Its a nice little racket Disney has going here.  Way to nickel and dime for a sub par product.",1304726400,,818,4.259740259740259
4289927,5,B0049GYXFO,World of Rhythm is one of the best baby einstein movies yet. My eighteen month old boys went crazy for it the first time they watched it and it continues to be their favorite show. The music is fun for me and for them and they love watching the other kids dance in the movie. This is a great dvd for interacting with your children. We also enjoy listening to the CD and looking at the book. Though I think the book could use a little improvement.,1301443200,3,446,4.137931034482759
