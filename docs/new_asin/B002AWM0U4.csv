8360504,4,B002AWM0U4,"I'm a hardcore Giallo/horror fan who likes Lamberto Bava's films - that being said the film is not for the masses.
If you've seen enough of the Italian Giallo/horror films then your expectations are right where they need to be and
there is no disappointment. This film is 1/4 of the Brivido Giallo Collection, an Italian cable TV series.
The film was used because it did not have enough substance for a feature film, but Bava thought it perfect for TV.",1489449600,,452,4.592592592592593
8360505,3,B002AWM0U4,"All 4 are nowhere near Lamberto's top movies, but this one is probably the worst...  Again if you are buying this you probably know what you are getting into and want to watch it.
MYA disks can be a little tricky sometimes...  They tend to do movies that others don't or won't touch...  And they never really spend big bucks on a restoration...  That being said this is a good looking MYA disk...  The video was fine with no major issues as was the sound.  These things are not always a given with MYA disks.",1449878400,,508,4.294736842105263
8360506,1,B002AWM0U4,"This is an Italian made for TV film that attempts to be cute and clever. Four wanna-be stars are at the castle of Jurek (George Hilton) famed horror movie producer and vampire. Their task is to figure out how to kill him before sunrise or become part of the undead.

The film includes a humpback Egor type character who is compared to Marty Feldman. The humor was more of an attempt than being clever. I failed to laugh or even smile.

Brief nudity. 80's style and humor.",1406937600,,471,4.402298850574713
8360507,3,B002AWM0U4,"A very poorly done TV movie with bad acting. Extensive lack of gore without reason.

I watched half the movie and snoozed it off.",1385337600,,129,4.375
8360508,3,B002AWM0U4,"Too much dumb 80's cheesy humor for me.......but still has a few fun moments in it. Glad i own it, just wasn't the straight up vampire film i thought it was gonna be.",1369440000,,166,4.0606060606060606
8360509,2,B002AWM0U4,"This is a film which starts off strong and slowly deteriorates into painfully comic cliches.  Euro Star George Hilton dons a cape and hams it up as Jurek, a horror movie director who is auditioning for his next film at his mansion and selects four teens to join him for dinner and horror film.  As part of an Italian television series called 'BRIVIDO GIALLO', this is by far the weakest entry I have seen.  Director Lamberto Bava and screenwriter Dardano Sachetti painfully put their actors through a lame outing filled with vampire jokes and Halloween theme park shenanigans.  Horror fans definitely deserve better.  Its no fault of Mya Communication, the transfer is crisp and clear and can be viewed in both English or Italian.  For Vampire completists only.",1285977600,4,761,4.90625
