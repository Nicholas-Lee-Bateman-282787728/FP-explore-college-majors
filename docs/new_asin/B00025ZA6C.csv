I wish this was on DVD as well though.",1487894400,,110,3.625
8426582,5,B00025ZA6C,WISH these would be available on DVD!!  My daughter LOVED these when she was young... now my grandsons love them.  But not sure how long we can keep a video player going!!  These are funny for the kids AND for the adults with humor that floats over young ones and keeps adults listening.  I do really love them.  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.,1470614400,,370,4.304347826086956
8426583,5,B00025ZA6C,"He's Marsupilami- the wonderfully wacky, wise-cracking whirlwind of nonstop hilarity with a tail that can turn into a swing, a spring- anything! You never can tell what this hip-hop Houbster will be up to, so don't miss this collection of delightful escapades from the jungle's most gregarious gagster... the one and only Marsupilami! Houba!

In This Hoube-Duper Volume:
""The Hairy Ape""
""Working Class Mars""
""Cropsy-Turvy""
""Mars' Problem Pachyderm""

I recommend this video to anyone who is a true fan of classic Disney Afternoon cartoons.",1095984000,,564,5.3977272727272725
