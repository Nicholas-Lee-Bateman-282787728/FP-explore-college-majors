2326052,4,B0009W32DQ,"This is the story of the United States only foreign invasion, when British Troops captured Washington DC and burnt the White House. Dolly Madison just escaped, saving a priceless copy of the Declaration of Independence along with George Washington's portrait. It is absorbing and well produced with good photography and graphics and the full story of The Star Spangled Banner. For kids from Nine to Ninety as the old saying goes.
Makes an interesting introduction to a less well known conflict and a key chapter in US history.

8067779,4,B0009W32DQ,This video will certainly keep your attention and allow you to learn something as well. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is I do not believe the US won the War of 1812 and this film gives the viewer that impression and makes the Americans out to be a little more pro-war and does not give much attention to any anti-war opinions with in the newly formed states.,1403308800,,366,4.242857142857143
