6205713,5,B00HSLI3S0,"Though this series updates the feeling and story of the musketeers for a newer audience, the production is very true to the swashbuckling spirit of Dumas classics, as well as the 70's movies comedy that have come to embody them.  The sword play is outstanding and heart pounding.  This production goes with a less acrobatic style than seen in recent versions, but opts for a more realistic and gritty approach to the sword play (again, perhaps for a modern audience that wants less saccharin).  There isn't much gore or anything like that, but the action still manages to be hard hitting.  Along with the sword play, the series manages to keep the verbal repartee that preserves the comedic and intellectual sparing which is just as important to the feel of the Musketeers.  The humor is much more natural and much more clever this time.  Not clownish.  This show is not a comedy, but the characters have very sharp wit.  Many re-boots go very dark, losing the humor all together.  The Musketeers are special though.  The verbal fencing is every bit as important as the real sword play.

The Musketeers are a slightly more diverse crew in this version. Back stories are explained quickly and each persona is developed meticulously to help the viewer see their gallantness, their honor, their skill, and their rakishness.  Each actor for Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan seem nearly born for the part by the time they get a chance to establish character.  Lady D'Winter didn't blow me over at first.  But they skilfully bring you into her and Athos' relationship and humanize her, while showing her capable of the most vicious plans.  She is the ultimate chess player!  Athos is not as Priestly in this version, but he still piously and honorably conducts himself while exuding the melancholy shadow that haunts him.  Constance in this version is not associated with the queen in any way.  She is the wife of a modest textile merchant.  The fact that she is married creates the tension between her and D'Artagnan.  She is beautiful but girl-next-door-ish.  Yet, she is a fiery red head that asks D'Artagnan to teach her some of the martial skills.  One thing I haven't liked in other Musketeer productions was King Louis.  He is supposed to be weak, but he was always so irritating.  Here the problem is rectified.  Ryan Gage is perfect for the part.  Louis is appropriately weak and slightly foppish, but he is still regal and able to project strength when the situation calls for it.  He is still very dependent on the Cardinal for his strength, but he is emerging.  Let's call him developmental.  I have a special mention for Queen Ann (played by Alexandra Dowling). She conveys such beauty, adorableness, fresh faced innocence.  Yet Alexandra is able to pull off the tricky parts when Ann needs to take control and be a queen in every way, powerfully exerting herself.  Alexandra seems to have that combination of erudite and innocence.  Cardinal Richelieu is not as physically imposing as one might expect, but Peter Capaldi is able to pull off the darker recesses of his persona.  He is not always at odds with the Musketeers in the beginning and seems to truly have France's interests at heart - along with his own.  Even the ancillary characters in single episodes are so fleshed out that the viewer cares very much about them, or at least what they do.  In British fashion, each episode is not designed to blow you over, but instead build the story layer on layer until you are queuing each episode one after the other to see what happens  in the end.

Great effort was made in creating an authentic atmosphere of Paris 1625.  The sets are meticulously sculpted to look very real.  It's all very tactile and done to the highest quality so you can't tell the difference from real stone or added set.  The costuming is stunning, though I am sure they took some dramatic license. The palaces, castles, costumes, countryside, and cinematography are all stupendous.  Hauntingly beautiful.  Even the color palates and focal points of light sources in every scene receive great attention, and it shows.  Cinematic quality in a TV series!  I rarely watch extras for any program.  But these were terrific.  The video regarding how they built the 1625 Paris world was very interesting.

Quality is apparent everywhere in this show.  I expect it has the potential to run as a classic for many years if they can keep the budget, writing, and actors all assembled.  It will be another icon of BBC productions.",1401753600,76,4510,4.802340702210663
6205714,5,B00HSLI3S0,"Never have I seen the Musketeers depicted in such a clever and interesting way. My mouth literally dropped open after seeing the first episode, and I continued to be surprised and impressed as the episodes progressed. The story lines are extremely well done, surprisingly powerful with their themes and messages. The characters are complex and meaningful (heroes you want to root for). And the action hits hard and matters, something rare in most movies and tv-shows these days.

Despite what other Dumas fans say, I for one heartily congratulate the writers on an excellent job of keeping the heart and vibe of his books, while giving it a modern feel. Rather than being dictated by the book, the writers offer a fresh perspective while still basing it off the book.  This is undoubtedly the best adaptation of the ""Three Musketeers"" I have ever seen.",1396396800,8,852,4.909722222222222
6205715,5,B00HSLI3S0,I absolutely loved this show!!! I only hope they release it in Region 1 format for the U.S. and that it is cheaper than almost $80. That is outlandish!!  That aside I highly recommend the series and I can't wait for Season 2!,1396224000,3,225,4.232558139534884
6205716,5,B00HSLI3S0,"SPOILER FREE

With the latest television adaptation of ""The Musketeers"", the BBC has finally managed to perfect the technique that was originally utilized in the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood/dp/B003TY2SUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00C4UR3PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>&nbsp;- that of taking a legendary hero (or in this case, group of heroes), keeping their iconic personalities, background and conflicts intact, but throwing them into an episodic series of adventures that allows for original storylines, personal character development, and a variety of guest-stars. Suffice to say, if you enjoyed the energy, style and general premise of those previous shows, you're pretty much the target audience for ""The Musketeers.""

But whereas ""Robin Hood"" inexplicably killed off vitally important characters in its season two finale (leaving the survivors to meander listlessly through an awful final season) and ""Merlin"" clung so strongly to its formula (""keep the magic secret"") that it shut down all possibility of any meaningful development, ""The Musketeers"" finds that happy balance between plot and character. Throw in a good grasp of continuity, high production values, and actors that embody their roles to perfection, and this a show that fully delivers on its promise of being swashbuckling fun for the whole family - emphasis on *fun*.

If you're a fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alexandre-Dumas-s-novel/dp/1493625810/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alexandre Dumas's novel</a>&nbsp;(and subsequent sequels) be warned that you're not going to find a faithful retelling of the plot. Instead, the writers are more concerned with keeping the spirit of the novel intact whilst spinning their own tales across the ten forty-five minute episodes that comprise the first season. And despite the departure from Dumas's stories, the scripts are pretty solidly written. Sure, they follow familiar plots (rescue a damsel in distress, thwart an assassin, clear the name of an innocent man/woman, hunt down a dangerous criminal), but there are very few plot-holes and some unexpected twists in the usual formula. Best of all - nobody is stupid, least of all our heroes. So many stories rely on characters behaving like idiots or ignoring the obvious, but this show very much pits intelligent villains against equally intelligent heroes, giving everything a real sense of suspense and tension.

The cast is impeccable. Seriously, there's not a weak note among them, and it's going to be difficult accepting future actors in these roles, so brilliantly does this cast embody each character. Tom Burke is a droll and world-weary Athos, the de-facto leader of the group who has perpetual suffering in his eyes despite his snarky quips. Santiago Cabrera (who played Lancelot on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00C4UR3PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>) is the free-spirited Aramis, whose religious faith and gentlemanly air belies his enjoyment of hedonistic pleasures.

Luke Pasqualino is a wonderful D'artagnan, capturing his youth, inexperience and hot-headedness without tipping him into obnoxiousness, whilst Charles Howard is probably the best Porthos I've ever seen. In a lovely touch, the writers draw upon Alexandre Dumas's personal history to map out the backstory of Porthos (in conversation, Porthos mentions that his mother was a freed slave; Alexandre Dumas was the son of a black Haitian, who in turn was the son of an aristocratic French father and a freed slave, Marie-Cesette). Already people are kicking up a fuss that the character is being played by a mixed-race actor, though I honestly don't see how anyone could watch five seconds of Charles Howard in the role and not think that he wasn't born to play Porthos.

Peter Capaldi is Cardinal Armand de Richelieu - so wonderfully nuanced in his plotting and scheming that I'm almost resentful that we're going to lose him to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B00C6ACVD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>, whilst Ryan Gage has the thankless task of playing King Louis XIII as a petulant man-child. Yet even he injects his role with a sense of pathos: this is a king surrounded by more competent, intelligent men, and despite all his posturing and bluster, Louis KNOWS it. That self-awareness does wonders in generating sympathy in the audience, for there's a clear effort on Louis's behalf in trying to keep up with those around him.

For a show that's headlined by so many male stars, you may be forgiven for thinking that there's no room for any women. There you'd be wrong. Tamla Kari is a wonderful Constance, with a weary tolerance but deep affection for all the Musketeers, who proves extremely useful when it comes to providing distractions and gathering information. Alexandra Dowling is a fragile and beautiful Queen Anne - perhaps a little underused at times, but with plenty of potential to grow as a character. And then of course, Maimie McCoy as Milady de Winter. It's my opinion that any adaptation of Dumas's story will rise or fall on its depiction of Milady, for she's the ultimate foil to the Musketeers, a woman whose seductive charms is about the only thing that could threaten their bromance. Here McCoy goes for femme fatale over guileless charm, making Milady a suitably cunning adversary. Yet the writing manages to explore her desire for revenge without demonizing her, and the simmering tension she leaves in her wake is one of the highpoints of the show.

Even the guest-stars bring it their all, with appearances from Jason Flemying, Zoe Tapper, James Callis, JJ Feild, Annabelle Wallis, Vinnie Jones, John Lynch and Tara Fitzgerald (basically, a bevy of familiar faces that you'll recognize from Poirot, The Tudors, Merlin, Downton Abbey and a range of other BBC dramas).

In short, ""The Musketeers"" is like getting a mini-action movie every week, filled with verve and energy and charm. I honestly can't remember the last time a light-hearted drama left me this satisfied. The chemistry between the leads is fantastic, the characters imminently loveable (even the bad guys!), the theme music rousing, and everything about the costuming and set design is gorgeous.

I'd say it's suitable for younger viewers (perhaps ages eight and up), though parents might want to have a quick trawl-through before leaving children alone with it. The violence is largely stylized with minimal blood, and any bedroom scenes are largely composed of characters reclining in bed with their clothes on (or at least fully concealed under the covers).

But most importantly, this is a show that actually has *heroes* as its protagonists. In recent years it feels as though there's been an onslaught of anti-heroes on television, with shows revolving around drug-dealers, serial killers, vampires, pirates, smugglers and other unsavory folk. I've enjoyed plenty of those shows, but I honestly can't tell you how uplifting it is to watch a show starring likable, decent men who uphold the law, live by a code of conduct, respect women, and consistently place others before their own needs. Sure, they've got their foibles, but all of them are focused on doing the right thing, and living for something greater than themselves. How utterly refreshing.

""The Musketeers"" gets five whole-hearted stars from me.",1395619200,20,7624,5.683933274802459

Together the three of them mete out the king's justice all the while trying to keep help those who can not help themselves.  One of their many hurdles is the King's own chief advisor the Cardinal Richelieu. With his own guard and an assassin  known only as Milday Dewinter.  All that and the back of the holy church itself in Rome.  He plots and plans to make himself more powerful and perhaps to one day rule France itself.

6205760,5,B00HSLI3S0,"We just finished watching this and loved every minute.  If you enjoy the swashbuckling, intrigue, action and the camaraderie of Dumas's Musketeer stories you will absolutely fall in love with this series.  Nothing but good fun that I would recommend for the whole family.  I would like to comment on the review by one reviewer about ""too much sex"".  Not sure what series she was watching, but there is absolutely no nudity, vulgarity, in-appropriate language, or anything to suggest anything beyond a PG13 rating.  There is kissing, hugging, and even a few ""in the bed"" shots where the actors are shown only from the chest up and are fully clothed and having conversations, so please don't be influenced by that and miss this terrific series.  Can't wait for the next one to arrive.

However, if you are a Dumas fan like I am, you will find this series is basically based only on the Dumas' characters and very little on the actual ""Musketeer"" story, although there are a few things like the relationship between Athos and Milady and Constance and D'artagnan, .  But this does not in any way distract from this great series.  You will pick up occasionally where they allude to certain things in the books, but they do not follow the storyline like movies built totally upon the actual book.  Each episode is a new tale and so fun to watch.  Don't miss this if you love the Musketeer sagas!  Settings, costumes, everything is done very well.  Makes you feel like you have been transported back to the 1600's.  All the characters continue through each episode.",1427068800,,1558,4.743494423791821

6205769,5,B00HSLI3S0,"Excellent rendition of a classic. The Three Musketeers is a very hard story to bring to the screen. It is both a cheerful romp and serious tragedy all at the same time. Too often have other productions crossed the line and turned Dumas' classic into a comic farce. Something more akin to Monty Python than anything else. This BBC series is different. They have successfully displayed the strength of Duma's story which is the friendship and loyalty of these four men. You root for them both as individual characters and together as a group. But what I feel is most different about this production from the others is the development of the Cardinal and Lady De Winter. These are not 1 dimensional villains with shallow paper thin motives but complex characters that mimic real life rather than a comic strip. I especially like the way the producers concentrate on the Cardinal's political acumen rather than simply having him assassinate everyone who gets in his way. He is most dangerous not for his willingness to simply kill people off (which surprisingly he doesn't do too often) but for his ability to manipulate people and things.

The actions is also well done. I am so tired of watching everyone doing Asian Martial Arts when there aren't even any Asians in the movie. I mean Good Lord, in the last two decades I've seen cowboys, European knights, Aztecs and even vampires doing kung fu and karate. The Musketeers may be fiction but at least the producers are smart enough to recognize their characters existed in a time when no one in Europe ever heard of kung fu let alone were masters of it. No, the action is straightforward, fun and plausible.

Very, very well done.",1419465600,,1678,4.743150684931507
