I have too many of this kind of book but the authors have found a way to nail it, and give us a process to life and to navigate through this crazy thing called life.

8419154,1,B0049MTTI4,The scenes I had seen in two other DVDs that I loved made me want to see this one. There was nothing new here and I was very disappointed. Would NOT recommend it to anyone.,1368835200,,172,3.942857142857143
8419155,5,B0049MTTI4,"Tapping the Source carries a lot in it. But like most Self-Help, Personal Development material, it cannot help but be a little corny at times. You have to shelve your ego, and read between the lines of what is being said. Which can be hard because this video is a non-stop machine gun blast of concepts and tools. I could only watch 15 minutes, pause the video, try to digest what was said and then go back to it. If your inclined, having a notebook handy will be helpful. And there is a clip in the video that I think was from a completely different documentary... can you find it?

Overall, It was uplifting, hopeful, Spirit filled information with no ego. There was no ""sales pitch"" by any of the speakers. There seemed to be an honest intent of improving other peoples lives and opening us up to ""More"". I could see this being shown (in small increments, over several showings) to a group of spiritually open people and having a discussion on it.

With so much ""Spiritual"" material out there, it is easy to become ""addicted"" to concepts. I could see that being easy to fall into here. Take what is for your highest good and put it into action. The rest is filler.",1331942400,9,1167,4.423255813953489
8419156,1,B0049MTTI4,"I had loved the book ""The Twelve"" by William Gladstone, so I thought that his movie ""Tapping the source"" would be as inspiring and uplifting, but it is not ! First, the music is so loud that it is sometimes very difficult to hear what the persons say (especially if English is not your mother tongue or if you have hearing difficulties), and second, the interviews are too short, too fast and very shallow... No time to ponder and integrate their messages.
Conversely to ""The Secret"", the names are not indicated, which is very frustrating, as either you try to recognize the famous ones (and you don't focus on what they say) or you just wonder who are the others. There is a kind of directory on the DVD (separate from the movie) but again it goes very fast and just gives the website of the speakers.
I totally agree with Ronald : it's a bunch of clips just thrown together with no real direction. I regret my purchase.",1325548800,8,922,4.461538461538462
8419157,5,B0049MTTI4,"This movie was majorly TMI...but in a great way!  I know I will have to watch it again and again and again to absorb all the wisdom packed into this DVD.  Yet, I look forward to it, because even the first viewing gave me confirmation, validation, inspiration, motivation, and especially and most of all...hope.  Thank you Bill, Richard and John, and all those sharing their profound insights.",1312156800,7,392,4.82089552238806
8419158,5,B0049MTTI4,"If you are interested in tapping or recognizing our source of clarity, wisdom, love, and the skillfulness to live an optimum human life this film is very inspiring and points you to that place within each of us. I loved listening to the diverse cast of authors and speakers in ""Tapping the Source,"" share their experiences and insights on recognition of source and how to be truly happy from not of this world but from a place from within. Truly inspiring!! A must see for anyone who wishes to be happy from within!",1300320000,12,515,4.548387096774194
8419159,5,B0049MTTI4,"I watched Tapping The Source last night. Congratulations and thank you.
What an impressive work! I loved the high-def images, the mixture of cameos, the quotes and insights.
But most of all I loved the fact that this movie helps people rediscover their connection with God.
This needs to be a discussion stimulator for families, groups and communities. If only we could get it into schools!

I suspect that using the Scenes feature one could easily navigate the content for discussion starters.
You have begun a very important process. May it produce abundance indefinitely and universally.
The world sure needs this right now.
