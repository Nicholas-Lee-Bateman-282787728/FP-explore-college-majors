It seems simplistic at first, but if you overcome your resistance as I had to do, it is very useful and helpful.  We have used this with staff and individuals have used it for their relationships.  You have to give it a chance.  A key understanding is how to express your need, how to identify when someone needs time before that to get rid of excess emotions, etc.  Expressing a need at its finest does not blame another, it states your need.  I love this work and I am pleased to know that there are many trainers now and a center built around it.",1485907200,,634,4.322033898305085

My INITIAL reactions echo OTHER one star reviews - from reading the late Marshall Rosenbergs book and hearing a companion audiobook. See SOME of 505 Amazon BOOK reviews. DVD set has ZERO reviews - not counting this pending review.

His work and talk employs undefined vague needs  with abandon.
Credibility suffers in approving daughters profanity with teacher.

For those suffering from information overload and too much STUFF, the Amazon Reader Review system is extremely valuable. Buried in books as it is, BEFORE buying more, what others think is important. Although I continue spending a fortune on books and related media, today Im likely to check library holdings FIRST and purchase later.

One COULD buy workshop DVD set for $63.49 : The Basics of Nonviolent Communication DVD SET.  As for me, I found DVDs in my local public library for a first viewing. Later I found it (only a few keystrokes away) on the net.

Nice to SEE how authors handle material,  how they present, and to learn to what extent its only a talking head approach. But, All too often video presentations can be replaced by audio. In this case, judge for yourself. How much is gained by LOOKING at presenter? In below,  the late Marshall Rosenberg just sat there and talked. I converted all into MP3 audio files.
