2345118,3,B000A0GPKE,I like Julie Delpy and she always shines . This film wasn't fabulous but it was nice to watch and I would watch it again.,1356912000,3,121,3.88
2345119,4,B000A0GPKE,"Some of us rely too much on movie critics for guidance.  Villa de Roses is a case in point for me.  Luckily, I hadn't read the early reviews in advance.  I tried this movie for no other reason than Julie Delpy.  I had enjoyed her performances in the two ""Before"" movies with Ethan Hawke and wanted to sample her work in a different role.

On the surface, Villa was a variation on old themes.  A needful, romantically vulnerable woman is left in the lurch by a free spirit who opts for status and largesse.  When there is no going back and the man is facing oblivion, this former lover is left with profound feelings of loss.  Another man, decent and needful in the same way as the woman, is on the sidelines barely noticed.  We are left reflecting on what might have been if the right connection had been made.  Each member of the larger cast of characters in the Villa is facing his or her own interwoven existential challenges.  Their struggles are evidence that life is hard.  One makes a point of this in his suicide note.

I gave this film four instead of five stars because of its unrelenting melancholy.  It is a downer in the traditional sense and that is enough usually to put me off.  But this movie is so vividly real, so true to life, it has to be appreciated.  The ""production values,"" as a Hollywood commentator might say, are outstanding.  The script is good, really good, but the directing and acting add the depth and subtlety that make the characters and events intensely  recognizable and real.  Julie Delpy was splendid in this different kind of role (as opposed to ""Before Sunrise).  Shirley Henderson was especially skillful in her part as the lead character's caring friend.  If there were nothing else to recommend, her performance alone made watching the movie worthwhile.  The set, the lightling, the atmosphere --- all were of high quality.

Anyway, sometimes it pays to take a chance on a movie.  (A quote from my wife.)  I have friends who won't even consider a movie unless their favorite critics give it a good review.  Following that strategy, I would have missed Villa de Roses.  That would have been a shame.  --Of course, it all depends on what one expects from a movie.",1144108800,51,2205,4.584615384615384
2345120,4,B000A0GPKE,"VILLA DES ROSES, based on the novel by Willem Elsschot, is a strange and claustrophobic examination of life in a confined space in Paris 1912-1913.  Director Frank Van Passel has surrounded his production with excellent scenery, effects, camera work and a cast of gifted actors to tell this bizarre tale of Europe on the brink of The Great War.

Villa des Roses is a dilapidated mansion in Paris that serves as a hotel for an astonishingly seedy group of people.  The hotel is 'managed' by a British man and wife Olive (Harriet Walter) and Hugh (Timothy West) who barely eek out a living from their irregular tenants. The one person apparently most in the know is Ella (Shirley Henderson) who is the Cook General and has access to all of the nooks and crannies via a spying system of tubes: she knows all the secrets of all of those housed in the Villa. It is an odd asylum for the British and for varied oddball, lost souls and disillusioned, loony guests in the midst of a rundown Paris.

Enter Louise Crteur (Julie Delphy), recently widowed by the Titanic sinking, who has left her young son behind to seek work in Paris.  She gains employment at the Villa des Roses as the Chamber Maid, under strict instruction by Olive to not fraternize with the guests.  But one of the tenants, Richard Grnewald (Shaun Dingwall) is a lady's man and soon the two have started a love affair that leads to the tragic end of the story.  Richard loathes children, is not at all happy that Louise has a son (though she vows to give up everything for her love for Richard), and when Louise becomes pregnant, Richard cools and encourages an abortion. Louise complies out of blind love only to return to the Villa to find that Richard must leave for Germany (when actually he is following the latest American guest in her transfer to a better hotel).  Louise's only confidant and friend is Ella and together they survive.  Louise decides to go to Germany to 'find Richard' and on her way to the train sees Richard with his American paramour.  Richard is called to military service at the same time Louise is boarding the train, a moment that proves to be the outbreak of WW I.  How the story ends is tender and sad and best left as a surprise to the viewer.

Van Passel seems more interested in atmosphere of this magically strange hotel than he is in fleshing out his storyline.  Oh, each of the characters is vastly interesting, but there is no background history on any of them that let us know why they had fallen into the sad mess of the Villa.  But the performances by Julie Delphy, Shirley Henderson, and  Shaun Dingwall are so fine that they maintain our attention and empathy. The strong supporting cast does as much as it can with the relatively little character development given them. The entire film is photographed in sepia tones that add enormously to the feeling of France on the brink of downfall.

This is a long film, highly dependent on visual imagery to keep it flowing, but a film with many messages about the world at the brink of war.  Recommended.  Grady Harp, September 05",1127347200,21,3079,4.577413479052823

The photography desaturated the color as if to drain life from the experience. Maybe this was done to approximate old sepia-toned and hand-colored photos. The process did not quite work for me. My grandmother's hand-tinted photos have still got more pizzazz. Julie Delpy is always interesting to watch. She is more enjoyable as a post-femnist in ""Two Days in Paris (or is it three?)""

2345195,3,B000A0GPKE,"The Oldest Story Ever Told...with oddly Steampunk overtones. The sad tale of the beautiful country girl marooned in Paris in dire circumstances while trying to fit in as the lone chambermaid in an amazing ancient, huge Napoleonic era boarding house, c. 1900.

The weirdo tech relics and beautiful visuals are worth it, especially if you're interested in period dramas or precursors to Steampunk. There are incredible *Machine Age* features in this ancienne regime building that are worth seeing for designers, lovers of all things French, aficionados of early19th C. tech, and Steampunk.

We live an 125-year old US, Victorian here in the US, and our small building has one of these Eldritch Speaker Phones that are...wireless and made entirely of brass. But wait!! A must-see that's *seldom seen*, very rare,  is what I'll call the PanOpticon***, a contraption of linked demi-periscopes to spy on your naughty boarders...An absolute must-see for gadgeteurs and gizmatics, but a slow-as-molasses story. The actors? OK, so who's more exquisite than dreamy fey French beauty, Julie Delpy [KILLING ZOE, and more] ? Add super BBC character actors like wisecracking cook Shirley Henderson [Moaning Myrtle in HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, THE WAY WE LIVE NOW] provide support with great effect and color. Which is more important than usual, because the leads are pretty but without much passion. And of course, there's the monkey. For special interests only: you like the period dramas, you like Paris, you like Steampunk and gizmos.

***Yes, if you're an architect or design student, I used this metaphorically in the review, where it's a mysterious Napoleonic/Victorian gearhead surveillance gadget, and I get that the original PanOpticon is a set of architectural features in absolute *form follows function* toward seamless central control via 360-degree surveillance,  assembled around a massive glass-walled central tower to enable *total surveillance*. PanOp features were originally employed state institutions -- high security prisons and mental hospitals.",1480550400,,2066,5.463949843260188

2345335,5,B000A0GPKE,"This film is features the horrific emotional abuse of a woman, as well as the horrific abuse of a premature baby who went through the agony of being aborted.  However, these same horrific abuses are not uncommon in real life.  I thought this film was going to be romantic.  Instead it is a realistic warning about the modern-society-approved abuse truly perpetrated by the vast majority of modern men who feel entitled to sex outside of marriage with whatever number of women by whatever means while abusing the results.  It would be best shown to people who mistakenly think most men won't lie for sex or abuse women or abuse babies.  Men are in fact entitled to NOTHING.  Most men generally care nothing about what happens to their outside-of-marriage sexual partners (emotional pain, pregnancy, disease) or the children that result from that.  This means that when a man says or acts like he loves you and tries to have sex with you outside of marriage, that he does not love you enough to marry you, and in fact does not love you at all.  Watch the movie and learn, if you have any questions.  Real men protect women from emotional hurt, unwanted pregnancy, and disease.  Most male individuals are not real men, unfortunately, no matter how handsome they do or do not look, or how much they smile or talk, or how they make woman feel.

I did feel bad for the character played by Shaun Dingwall also as I surmised he really wanted her but was concerned he couldn't provide a home for her and he was better off with the rich widow even though he didn't love her. He was a cad but he wasn't happy about it either. So it was a sad ending and that's why I only gave it 4 stars. There were many interesting characters, Shirley Henderson is lots of fun.  The filming is beautiful, I loved the old postcards that are animated.  I feel it is worth watching for that alone and I might even watch it again.",1463529600,4,704,4.207407407407407

Set in pre-World War One Paris, black & white, very good acting but POOR, POOR sound quality. LOTS of mumbling, inaudible voice tracks. If you watch it, at least use good headphones. But your time can be much better spent watching many other movies. If movies are to also entertain, this one FLOPS.

All the story is ... is a dilapidated Parisian boarding-house with its young French maid falling in love with a German artist boarder who gets her pregnant and then leaves her -- moving into a swank Paris hotel with a rich woman. Lots of 'dark' in this movie ... dark alleyways, dark love affair, dark sound ... just generally a 'dark' movie. No firm ending, as at end apparently the man walks away into the war and is killed. So he did love her, but wasn't man enough to be a man in the world!

Some good filming and directing but otherwise ... lacking real story, it's difficult to make something out of nothing!

2345982,2,B000A0GPKE,"""Villa Des Roses"" is beautifully filmed, and capably acted; but do not be fooled by its romantic sounding title. This is one long bout of misery.

In this dilapidated old boarding house, no one truly seems to be nice to anyone. I take that back: The mysterious guest who likes to do nude calisthenics tries to protect the vulnerable new chambermaid, a young widow, from the resident cad. However, he does not warn the right person; he tries to appeal to the scoundrel's humanity but he apparently has none.

The other moment of kindness is when the old woman who is abused or neglected by all, feeds a bit of an orange to a small monkey. And that's it.

Other than those two brief moments, this one film contains a suicide, an abortion, and multiple acts of cruelty. We are supposed to care that the scoundrel decides he 'really does love' the chambermaid after all; he's apparently unaware that love is a verb, not a noun. Either way he does not know the meaning of the word; and the film's final failing is attempting to place our sympathies with him rather than with anyone who actually might deserve them.

It is a shame the writing is so dark and bleak; it lacks the passion to even be cynical. The actors do a fine job, and the film is well cast, with talented art direction and evocative cinematography. I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn't like to imagine themselves in a bathtub with a straight razor at the end of the film.",1427500800,24,1445,4.482889733840304
