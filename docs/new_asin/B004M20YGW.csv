8435454,4,B004M20YGW,"Didn't like this so much at first (episodes 1 -4 but it grows on you so I wound up buying 4 - 8.  It is a spoof and Colliandro can really make you groan, though he comes out almost the winner mostly but never gets credit for anything good he does.  His reputation is so bad his superiors never notice or want to notice that he is often the only reason the crime gets solved in the end.  All they notice is he is usually showing off and acting stupid.  It is a mix of humor and drama.  Most of the major actors are really good in their roles.  My husband and I really enjoyed episode 7 and think it is the best so far.  We have not watched 8 yet.",1417219200,,645,3.877862595419847
8435455,1,B004M20YGW,"Not up to the others Montalbano, fog and Crimes De Luca and Nardone, these are classic Italian Crime shows, collandro lacks Substance, acting and and story, too much on the macho image",1373500800,,184,4.78125
8435456,2,B004M20YGW,Inspector Coliandro  did not hold my interest.  He plays the buffoon who accidently solves the mystery and of course gets no credit for it while in each episode manages to get involved with another beautiful woman which of course doesn't work out for him in the end.,1366156800,,266,4.638297872340425
8435457,4,B004M20YGW,"I like the Inspector Colliandro shows because they are entertaining even though Giampaolo Morelli portrays a crude, day-dreaming detective who nearly always gets the wrong answer.  Ignore the profanity and you will find it likable.  The plots are very good and most of the acting is worth watching.",1359072000,3,298,5.1875
8435458,4,B004M20YGW,"Enjoyable, especially if you love to listen to the Italian language.  Coliandro is a bit like Inspector Clouseau and Columbo.  Lots of humor with an ending that eludes giving the credit to the true bungling detective hero--Coliandro.",1327795200,3,233,5.27027027027027
8435459,5,B004M20YGW,"I put the same review on the 1-4 episode page. I'll also add that I just watched 'Double Robbery', and although there were a couple of moments where it stretched a bit awkwardly, it was still enjoyable. Especially the last 5 minutes. 'I think she has an extra gun' - funny.

Coliandro is great. It should be compared against U.S. television shows, as that's what it is in Italy. And it is SO much better than most of the predictable stuff out there.

Basically, this guy thinks he's all that, when he isn't. He still gets the occasional girl, and foils the occasional crime, but even when he succeeds, he's still an idiot. But a lovable idiot.

Is every scene perfect? No. Is every single plot point logical. No. But most are. And the stories are interesting and more than just one level deep.

I've watched 5 or so episodes, and there wasn't one that didn't make me laugh at least a few times. Don't buy this series thinking your going to get Oscar caliber performances (although the lead actor is really damn good). But what you will get is some easy going, fun to watch television. I know I really like it. Coliandro!",1327017600,4,1120,4.4754901960784315
8435460,5,B004M20YGW,"Just to let you know that you get 400 minutes, not 270 as stated in the product description.  Note also that Trombetti does not appear in any of these episodes.  There is an Inspector Gamberini (""Gambero"" which means ""shrimp""), another female colleague, and De Zan is now wearing a beard (looks more ferocious).

Episode 5:  THE PISTOL:  ""A young woman steals Coliandro's pistol while he is trying to arrest her for theft.  Coliandro's effort to find the gun leads him into the underbelly of the international crime world.""  (Actually, he has to buy another pistol, and she steals that one too, but she is a ""good girl"" not a criminal.)

Episode 6: SEX AND SECRETS:  ""A call girl helps Coliandro uncover a plot that incriminates officials at the highest levels....""

Episode 7:  DOUBLE ROBBERY:  ""Two sets of robbers begin a heist at the same bank at the same time.  Too bad neither set knows Coliandro is also in the building.""

Episode 8:  NEVER STEAL FROM A THIEF:  ""Teaming up with a young social worker, Elena, and his fellow officer, 'Gambero', Coliandro uncovers a dangerous criminal band implicated in the murder of some gypsies.""",1308700800,4,1138,4.818652849740933
