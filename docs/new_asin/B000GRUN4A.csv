8134341,1,B000GRUN4A,"I bought this multipack some time ago and can honestly say I do not remember anything about the movies except that they were low budget and poorly acted. That said, I can only give it 1 star and a yawn.",1340323200,3,202,4.075
8134342,1,B000GRUN4A,"A collection of the most violent and erotic films ever made??? Let's be serious. I bought this box set because I enjoy a good horror flick, like Wolf Creek, but this is garbage. Poor acting, poor special effects, poor everything (well, not quite everything, Stained has some decent performances......but that's not enough).
This is NOT Wolf Creek or Gone, this is amatourish at its best.",1207094400,3,387,4.969230769230769
8134343,5,B000GRUN4A,"A great sick-fun trilogy, way ahead of its time! Marauders (1987) is more Quentin Tarantino than QT himself. And all the way from Melbourne, Australia. Now I want to see everything by Mark Savage, it would be great to see him at some festivals in London/Europe. MAGIC!",1197849600,4,268,4.723404255319149
8134344,5,B000GRUN4A,Mark Savage's films are incredibly entertaining and disturbing. The best exploitation and horror generally is. A seminal box set!,1159833600,5,129,5.842105263157895
8134345,1,B000GRUN4A,"I have seen my share of worthless ""entertainment"" in my day,this release gives new meaning to ""trash"" - but not ""trash"" as in totally void of morality (but fun anyway),but as in ""trash""that's not worth the disc it's mastered to! These ""films"" demonstrate mind-numbingly amateurish ""acting"" that I haven't experienced in quite some time. Jeez,we really must not have anything left to release on the dvd format,as this set proves they are scraping the bottom of the barrel! I really am struggling to recognize any talent Subversive Cinema is seeing in this?Trust me,the ""shocking violence"" is nothing you haven't seen already (and much more convincingly) in many other exploitation films from decades past. I want my money back....",1158537600,17,729,5.186440677966102
