8036137,4,B0004IXFJQ,"As a practicing Iaido student, I found the layout clear and easy to understand. A beginner would find their way through it no trouble. I particulaly liked the emphasis in all examples on the safety aspects of working with live blades. The Bokken work also needs to be controlled as these weapons can do considerable damage if miss-used. Very happy with the disk.",1180137600,2,362,4.761904761904762
8036138,5,B0004IXFJQ,This DVD gives great insight into the art of Iaido. I learned a lot about the kata. It also details the two man fighting kata which I really enjoyed. This dvd finishes with a really great instructional portion on how to really cut with a sword. A lot of bang for the buck. Excellent quality production.,1096502400,6,302,4.410714285714286
