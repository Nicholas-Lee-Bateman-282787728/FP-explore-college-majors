7962794,3,B000067IZH,"Unlike most horror films today, this film is not ""JUST GORY, NO STORY"" with a trite story line.  Lionsgate and Clive Barker are bad about ""JUST GORY, NO STORY"". When I see these names I usually pass on the movie even though I`m and avid horror fan. This film (STRICKEN) is different and worth seeing.  Oh, for the good old days when they knew how to make good horror.",1263254400,,367,4.304347826086956
