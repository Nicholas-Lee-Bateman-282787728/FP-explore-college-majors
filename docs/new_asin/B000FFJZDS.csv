2564340,2,B000FFJZDS,I got tired of this movie early into it and watched something else that had a little more action.  Maybe if I'd hung in there with it I would have eventually liked it but life is too short.,1391299200,,189,3.973684210526316
2564341,2,B000FFJZDS,"Don't ask me why I kept watching until the end - the acting wasn't bad.  Other than that, nothing really redeeming to say about the movie.",1384041600,,138,4.3076923076923075
2564342,5,B000FFJZDS,"Very spectacular actors, Keeps you on the edge of your seat knowing what will happen.  Very good movie.  Very much worth watching and I will watch it again.",1384041600,,156,4.535714285714286
2564343,5,B000FFJZDS,"I love shows with Genie Francis in them, she is a great actress.  The show kept my interest and am a big mystery fan. Love the movie.",1377734400,,133,3.925925925925926
2564344,3,B000FFJZDS,"In TERROR IN THE SHADOWS, Marcy Walker plays a severely mentally ill woman who believes that her deceased baby is still alive. She was institutionalized after giving the boy up for adoption, only to change her mind, and kill the adoptive mother! During the melee, she accidentally broke the baby's neck. Years later, she escapes from the mental institution, and heads out to seek revenge on the adoptive father. Can he, along w/ his new wife and son survive? TERROR isn't bad for a made-for-TV production. It does have some sappy moments, but there's just (barely) enough suspense and murder to outweigh the silliness...",1370736000,4,620,4.971153846153846
2564345,4,B000FFJZDS,"At the end of a rather long day, it was the perfect movie with some excitement, suspense, and just an escapist type of experience.  Sometimes, just what you need.",1369180800,,162,4.586206896551724
2564346,3,B000FFJZDS,"If you like Lifetime movies, you'll enjoy this one. Unfortunately, as with most of these types of TV movies, it is slow and predictable.",1362182400,4,136,4.708333333333333
2564347,5,B000FFJZDS,it was really good,1441670400,,18,3.75
2564348,5,B000FFJZDS,"OMG what an 80's soap star fest; Laura from General Hospital, Liza Colby from All my Children, and Rachel Cory from Another World.  This movie is suspenseful, keeps you watching, but there are no blood and gore in the murder scenes, because it was made in the 80's and it wasn't allowed.  The good old days.

It is a tad slow, but soap operas are always slow.  The ending is fabulous, you will be yelling and screaming at the computer; ""run, hurry, go, oh no!""",1430956800,,460,4.376470588235295
2564349,5,B000FFJZDS,Loved it,1428364800,,8,3.5
2564350,3,B000FFJZDS,"This is movie is very much like 'Hand That Rocks the Cradle'.  Typical to the last.

First point - Sure, just go in someone's wallet (unprovoked) on a hunch and find out they're finding something.

Second point - (Spoiler) - Interesting how Kay, a woman who died who was labeled as a fighter, lost the battle and was killed; but the wife - no fighter at all - wins the day.

Again, predictable but ok.",1404950400,,401,4.306666666666667
2564351,2,B000FFJZDS,This was a movie that I started and did not finish because it didn't keep my attention.  It might have been a great movie and simply clashed with the mood at the time.,1403913600,,167,4.0606060606060606
2564352,5,B000FFJZDS,"First of all, I like this movie. Second, I love Marcy Walker! She's the reason I ordered it & continue to watch it again and again! I've been a huge fan of her since she played Liza Colby All My Children. She's amazing!!! If for nothing else, watch this movie because of Marcy. She makes any role she plays one you will never forget.",1400716800,,333,4.21875
2564353,1,B000FFJZDS,"Bad acting, bad script.  Also movie is at least 15 yes old.  Think Amazon like Netflix and Hulu should have date movie shot.",1398470400,,124,4.3478260869565215
2564354,2,B000FFJZDS,I didn't actually stay with this one as I was very disappointed to see how old it was and a made for tv movie at that.  I don't like when Im charged for such material as I feel duped . . . I think it would be helpful to the viewer to see clearly the date and origin of the movie . . . for instance 1990 and a Lifetime made for tv film.  That would allow the viewer to decide if they want to spend money on it.,1394928000,,409,3.5842696629213484
2564355,4,B000FFJZDS,"I purchased this movie because I have always liked Genie Francis. I enjoyed her so much on General Hospital in the 80's as Laura then in Bare Essence and North and South that i wanted to see more. This movie is a great thriller, it will keep you on edge and once again you cant help but love Genie Francis",1394582400,2,305,4.1
2564356,2,B000FFJZDS,"this movie was ok,but a little short. I just wanted more to the story as it was not what i expected.",1394236800,,100,3.8095238095238093

8121998,5,B000FFJZDS,Super acting and a terrific plot. Very good suspense movie. Enjoyable!,1470700800,,70,5.454545454545454
8121999,2,B000FFJZDS,This picture is is unrealistic and silly..,1469577600,,42,5.142857142857143
8122000,4,B000FFJZDS,"I used to watch soap operas...so I definitely was interested in the movie when I saw that Genie Francis was one of the stars.  Yes...the movie was very similar to ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" ... which I enjoyed;  it was not necessarily so predictable that I didn't want to hang in there.  Since I suspected the similarities before I started watching, I enjoyed this movie for it's own attempt to keep me interested.  The movie did not fail to do that!  I think the character of Sarah was too trusting of her new employee of just a week with regard to her son, which annoyed me ... but other than that, I did enjoy the suspense of the movie.  The playground conversation amongst Brian and his friends regarding ""What is a serial killer"" was so funny.",1468886400,,754,4.427536231884058
8122001,2,B000FFJZDS,"20-year-old made-for-TV movie starring several soap opera actors. That pretty much says it all. The movie is agonizingly slow, there is no suspense whatsoever - you know what's going to happen, it's just a matter of time, and since it's made-for-TV, you know the good guys are going to win. No spoiler there, anyone who doesn't have that figured out when they see the dated Nineties clothing and hairstyles is an idiot. Not sure why I wasted my time with this one. Maybe because I knew there wouldn't be much blood and gore, unlike theatrical releases. If you're a soap opera fan, you might enjoy seeing some of your favorite actors in this movie. Otherwise I would say skip it unless you're looking for something mildly suspenseful to watch with your preteen or young teenager. Even an 18-year-old would probably find this movie boring and unsuspenseful.",1468540800,,855,4.863013698630137
8122002,5,B000FFJZDS,Now that's my kind of movie. It had all the Terror & Chills you could ask for. Awesome movie.,1467849600,,93,3.9473684210526314
8122003,4,B000FFJZDS,"Pretty good story, but predictable.",1466208000,,35,6.2
8122004,3,B000FFJZDS,"Not the best, but I've seen worse",1446249600,,33,3.857142857142857
8122005,3,B000FFJZDS,"An older movie, but suspenseful and interesting. Not real good picture quality.",1442016000,,79,5.666666666666667
