7564849,5,B01975R6UU,"I have probably watched every found footage film out there, this one caught my attention because of its ""original"" premise. It reminded me of The Hills Have Eyes.. The acting is not great but ok. The night scenes are creepy",1460160000,,223,4.6
7564850,3,B01975R6UU,"After 8 headless bodies have been found in the desert, two news teams work together to make a reality TV show about go to the desert after legendary Navajo treasure protected by evil spirits. If you have ever seen a hand held camera film before, you know what to expect: interview, screaming, jumping camera, and a cover scene with a person being dragged off.  The trip is lead by Daniel (Ted Jonas) who acts like a young Billy Zane. It includes his former GF anchor Kim (Jules Hartley) and his current GF anchor Cate (Danielle Baker) in order to create drama. Acting was better than most found footage films.

If you like found footage films, this one should be in your wheelhouse.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Danielle Baker in tube top, shorts, and heels dancing on a table.",1458345600,3,782,4.571428571428571

7564853,1,B01975R6UU,"I continued watching this to see how much worse it could get.  Navajo gold?!  Who knew that Indians minted gold coins?  If I remember correctly only the Incas, Mayans and Aztecs took any interest in gold for ornamental purposes.  They made beautiful objects and stored them in their cities.  The northern Indians were nomads and didn't carry around useless objects.  So apart from bad historical context, was there anything good about this movie?  Bad story, bad script, bad acting.  Much like a true reality show.",1473120000,6,514,4.964705882352941

7564859,4,B01975R6UU,"Not a bad movie, it just shows how selfish people can be. And how uncaring greed can do to some. Not scary! & it's not all blood, and guts, so that's a good thing. The acting is so, so.",1471996800,3,185,3.769230769230769

8744247,3,B01975R6UU,"Found footage film that contains many cliches and some strange fantasy mythology of the old west. Pacing is probably the best part of the film - you don't get much time to get bored. But substance is pretty thin, and there's not a lot on the table here. The fx were interesting, but I felt like they could have done more along the way. It's not like the plot did not present a lot of opportunities, they just didn't capitalize on them very well imho. Still, it's not a horrible film to while away some time with.",1491955200,3,512,4.288659793814433
