8166196,5,6305583218,I just love the Canton Spirituals to the moon and back.  I am so glad I purchased this on DVD.  All of the songs are amazing. Harvey Junior (H.J I like to call him) did his thing.  I was really please with my Dwayne Watkins and Victor Allen Sr.  My favorite part is when Dwayne got to praising the Lord. That got me going too.  But this group is amazing!!!  I mean AMAZING.  There is not one song on this DVD that I didn't like. Therefore I give it all the stars in Heaven!!!,1402531200,,475,3.9893617021276597

8166199,2,6305583218,"Some of the selections are really enjoyable.  The Cantons spend too much time talking about themselves, who they use to be, the singers that started the group, the breaks that didn't come their way and how spiritual they are.  Some of it sounds like burn out.  When they just sing and get into it they can be great.",1365897600,,315,4.396551724137931
