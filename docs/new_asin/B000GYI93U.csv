8344135,1,B000GYI93U,I expected so much more than what I got! The video is so boring. There is no music and no background. It is so flat and dull.  At least add some tranquil music to the workout! sheesh!,1363478400,,183,3.945945945945946
8344136,5,B000GYI93U,"This is a great yoga video, especially if you're short on time.  You can do one 20 minute session or do all three together for a full-length practice.  Easy to follow and fun.",1227484800,,175,4.2727272727272725
8344137,5,B000GYI93U,"I have taken yoga in a class previously and this instructor follows the same flow, great fitness yoga.  There is hardly any of the meditation, get in touch with your chi stuff. It focuses on strengthening and stretching your body, not your chakra The only weird factor is she gives instruction as a voice over instead of talking it out as she takes you through it. Once you get used to not seeing her lips move, it's fine. I like that I can do part or all of it depending on time.",1220918400,,480,4.217391304347826
