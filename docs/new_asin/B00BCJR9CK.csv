As Luck Would Have It is about a husband, played by Jose Mota, as an unemployed advertising executive that created a popular soft drink jingle but he found himself unemployed.

For the past month he would leave as if he had a job but little did his wife, played by Salma Hayek know that he had been unemployed for quite a while. The last straw occurred when he asked to be rehired by the former advertisement agency and with his anniversary coming up he wanted to do something special for his wife.  He decides to revisit the special place where they had their honeymoon which was now turned into a museum.

He is so distraught that we began to wonder throughout the museum to an area that was off limits. With each step he was entering into danger.  A security guard prohibited him from moving forward because little did he know was that the floor was unfinished.  As he stepped off the ledge he tumbled and fell onto a grate that was prepped for framing and later it was discovered that as he landed one of the rods that was sticking up went into the back of his head. He wondered why he was unable to move and began to experience a headache it was because the rod was in his skull.

As you journey through this movie you began to see the character of people from that of love to greed to self-interest.; even the media played a tremendous part in how his life was depicted during this grueling time of his life.  Want to see a movie that it touching and humanistic  As Luck Would Have It is a much see. Great job everyone including the director, lex de la Iglesia.",1451606400,,1697,4.29153605015674

However, good thing I'm Latina American & don't mind reading the English subtitles. It's a comedy drama. Good story line, and will keep you wondering til the end if the man's gonna make it or not. I recommend this movie to those that speak Spanish, and to those that are patient having no problems watching a movie in English subtitles (if unable to speak Spanish). I also got lucky when I paid under $5 for this movie - Blockbuster's liquidation sale....enjoy it folks!",1410480000,2,623,4.426086956521739
