Same can be said about Maken-Ki, if you've already seen anime's like ""Love Hina"" then you already know whats going to happen. Ok so you have a school of hott volumptuous young teenage girls who are also super strong fighters as well. Then you have your resident geek, he's the main male character & just like lots of other anime's he's a no common sense having clumsy perverted idiot. One of the girls is his best friend from childhood who secretly likes him but never tells him, another one of the girls likes him alot but he pretty much runs from her everytime she try's to get with him. Whenever his childhood friend see's him & the girl who shows how much she likes him together, she gets upset and beats him up. Here's my question, why do the Japanese continue to write these types of anime's for adults to watch, there's lots of nudity & fanservice in this series so clearly it's not for minors? The characters are well drawn but other than that, it's kinda flat & boring, don't buy rent it...",1370217600,,1129,4.53921568627451
