4230227,5,B003YKVGKG,"My boys LOVED this movie. My 4 year old is very much into repetition and likes to watch shows over and over until we can convince him to move onto another one and this one has been the top pick for 2 weeks now! He loves to follow The Cat in the Hat on his magical adventures and learn about all the animals. His favorite episode is about Tucker the Hermit Crab who has outgrown his shell and so the crew set out to help him find the perfect new shell. I love that he is being exposed to lessons that would be hard to teach, or things I just might not have thought to talk about much such as bats being able to find food and communicate at night through sound or how honey is made! This DVD was a great educational resources as well as being very entertaining to both boys.",1285200000,4,772,4.052287581699346
4230228,5,B003YKVGKG,"Join the Cat in the Hat, along with Sally, Nick and their friends: Fish (from One Fish, Two Fish) and Thing 1 & Thing 2 (from The Cat in the Hat).

They will travel the world to places only a Dr. Seuss character can go like Wigiwashoo answering Sally and Nick's questions about nature. In this DVD, the children will learn:

  * how honey is made

  * why birds migrate

  * about the sleeping patterns of animals- those that sleep during the day and those that sleep at night.

  * critters that change [shell]  homes and

  * how ants work together to get things done

They travel in the Cat's Thinga-Ma-Jigger. Just buckle up, flick the jig-a-ma-wizer in the Thinga-Ma-Jigger and they are on their way! Too Big? No worries! Press the Shrink-a-madoodle and you'll shrink down to the perfect size to go inside of a birdhouse or a beeehive!

The Cat in the Hat doesn't leave us high and dry, he is full of classic Dr. Seuss rhymes like:

""Of all of the tongues in the world you could see, there is none as long as the tongue of a bee.""
""I know, I know you can't believe your eyes, ants can carry a load many times their size.""
""I know what to do! This is a job for Thing 1 and Thing 2!""
""A migration vacation. Up, up and away. We'll follow those Martins if it takes all day! ""

I. Love. Dr. Seuss. I have a wide collection of his books that I've always loved to share with my students and now, with my daughter. Oh, the Places You'll Go! is a bedtime favorite here. Though Dr. Seuss is gone, I truly believe that his legacy will forever live on for generations to come. I am so excited for the release of this show on PBS this fall and The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That: Wings and Things will leave you excited, too!",1285200000,13,1724,4.163636363636364

The Cat in the Hat is back again with Thing 1 and Thing 2, Sally and Nick  and the  worrisome fish in a all new PBS cartoon series this Fall 2010.

The Cat in the Hat is joined by The Fish, Thing 1, and Thing 2 as the Thing-a-ma-jigger helps them go, go, go on adventures.

4230232,5,B003YKVGKG,"My son loves this show, as do I.  It is a great update of The Cat In The Hat.  The show is funny, has good music and is also quite informative.  Martin Short is perfect voice casting, and overall this show really nails what is so great about Dr. Seuss.  My three-year-old already knows the words to the songs and asks to watch this quite often.  I find myself drawn in when he's watching it.  We both think that it's great!",1284508800,,423,4.160493827160494
4230233,5,B003YKVGKG,"I saw this in the grocery store over the weekend (sorry Amazon) and had to grab it for the kiddos.  This is a brand-new show, and Martin Short is the voice of the cat.  Oh, and it's AWESOME.  We can't stop watching it.  It's funny, full of music, and best of all...educational! :)
I think it's kind of like a souped-up, Dr. Seuss take on the Magic School Bus.  Remember how the bus shrank down to the size of a blood cell (or whatever) for the Magic School Bus adventures?  It's kind of the same concept here.  For instance, the kids wonder how honey is made, so the cat shrinks the Thingamajigger (their mode of transport!) down to bee size, and all of the kids are magically wearing black and yellow striped shirts so they can chat with the bees undetected.  It's super, super cute.  A lot of great science info, and again, the music is so fun.  The show also seems very true to the classic Dr. Seuss.  Some nice rhyming, and the art is very classic.  This is by far the best Dr. Seuss adaptation. Pick up a copy and go, go go for an adventure! (The Thingamagigger song.) :) A++!",1284508800,,1081,4.270935960591133

4230273,4,B003YKVGKG,"We love the Cat in the Hat around here.

Martin Short is great, as usual, in this special. He's the perfect choice for the Cat: just verging on crazy, but mostly fun and sweet.

The songs are catchy (at least, we're still singing them) and pretty well-written. The animal characters are fun and the plot is fine for a three or four-year-old to follow.

My one complaint would be that this dvd, including all of the adverts for the Gruffalo, etc., play on repeat forever and ever once you press play. It doesn't just play through everything once and then return to menu; it loops back and plays it all again. And quickly, too. You might have to race for the remote to shut it off as soon as the credits roll if your kid thinks that means the movie's not over. Not that I speak from personal experience or anything.",1391126400,5,813,4.370860927152318

For a 60 minute movie, it does a fabulous job holding their attention, and the songs are very cute (especially when my two year old sings them!). The Cat in the Hat is wonderfully entertaining, as always, and is supported by a great number of characters! Thing One and Thing Two, Sally, Nick, Fish, the little reindeer/caribou Ralph, Fifi the mouse, elephants, crabs, etc. etc. etc.
I did not give this item five stars as I do not find it as educational as some of the other Cat in the Hat Know a Lot about... DVD's, but since this is a Christmas movie, I see it more as entertainment anyways. It has really helped to kick off the holiday season in our house- the kids are already asking when we can get a Christmas tree and if fireflies will help us decorate it!
As always, I enjoy that there is nothing ""scary"" in these movies, since my two year old is very sensitive about scary things! Nice to watch a show without a freak-out!

I love the Dr. Seuss TV series on PBS Kids of The Cat In The Hat Knows a Lot About That. My favorite character on the TV show has to be Dr. Twiggles. He is quite cooky, but knows his trees very well. I love the Cat in The Hat too of course. Martin Short is a great voice for him :) We love how the show teaches about different things in each episode. I always learn something that I didn't know or had forgotten.

The Cat In The Hat Knows a Lot About Christmas! is an hour long Christmas special that was broadcast on PBS Kids on November 21st. It is now available on DVD. This is very musical with lots of singing. The lyrics to the songs are great. I loved how this movie taught to: be together with your family during the holidays because it is important, cooperate, help each other, put others first, never break promises and never give up. These are such important lessons. Also, I love how polite and nice everyone is with each other, especially the children with the parents and vice versa. They always ask their mother whether it is OK to go on adventures with The Cat In The Hat even though they know she is going to say yes every time.

This movie was better than I expected, since it kept my son's attention for the full 60 minutes. (which is not an easy task) My favorite thing about watching this with him, the Christmas cheer is now alive in our home! He is saying lots of new things like, snowman, Christmas tree, and talking about different new animals. I will definitely recommend this to my friends. A magical DVD great for your whole family.

Along with being entertaining The Cat in the Hat is also educational!  It's always fun to hear my kids spout out new facts they've learned about animals after watching this show.  I always learn things too.  It's a great family movie geared towards kids.  And as usual Thing 1 and Thing 2 make them giggle.

4230287,5,B003YKVGKG,"Head off on an adventure with the Cat and his friends Nick and Sally as they try to help a little lost reindeer called Ralph find his way home in time for Christmas.  Their journey takes them around the world - all the way to Freezeyourknees Snowland.  The bunch runs into an awful lot of trouble when their Thinga-ma-jigger breaks down during the journey, but they are given assistance by a whole realm of adventurous animals to help them on their way.

Our Thoughts:
My little one is 21 months old and he has a very select list of movies that he will watch - mostly involving Winnie the Pooh or anything that features a truck - so I was curious if this new story would interest him.  And I was very pleasantly surprised!  Maybe it's just that the Cat's Thinga-ma-jigger resembles a truck, or the assortment of animals that pop up throughout the feature, but it held his attention for quite awhile and he really seemed to enjoy it!

A good number of classic characters from Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat stories are featured - notably Thing 1 and Thing 2 and the Fish in the Pot.  For kids who are fans of the book, this DVD is a great way to bring the characters to life in a festive holiday setting!  The story paces well and features delightful songs throughout.  I think we will be returning to this movie for many years to come.",1353715200,,1330,4.352226720647773

4230289,5,B003YKVGKG,"The Cat in The Hat has become my kids new favorite to watch after they saw the Halloween DVD! They are SO excited about Christmas so a beloved character in a holiday movie evoked screams of excitement from them! They don't even have to see it yet to get their stamp of approval! I am not that easy to please so I had to check it out for myself!  As usual, NCircle did not disappoint!

The Cat in the Hat along with Sally and Nick have a party on Christmas Eve.  When one of the reindeer gets left behind, it becomes their mission to help him find his way! They experience their usual adventures trying to assist Ralph the Reindeer and by the end of it, he's having so much fun he doesn't want to go home!

The thing I love about these movies the most is the songs!  They are so clever and witty and catchy!  I only had to watch it once to get a song stuck in my head!  Martin Short is just the perfect voice for The Cat.  My kids don't notice it yet but I love a recognize able voice in cartoons.  For some reason it makes me connect to them more. I love the level of politeness and respect that the characters have when they speak to each other, especially to their mom!  Kids are little sponges and I don't want them soaking up anything negative.

The movie runs an hour which is perfect for me three and four year olds.  Their attention span grows with them but they still aren't really up for sitting through a full length movie so this is great for this age group.  It encourages creativity and imagination which is more than you get in most kids movies! I also appreciated that Santa Claus is referenced in the movie but never shown and not the main point.  It's nice to have a movie that isn't all about Santa!

The Cat in the Hat Christmas is the perfect stocking stuffer this season!  The kids will love it and mom will appreciate the lessons and integrity that NCircle is known for. It's a new classic for our holiday collection.",1353456000,,1939,4.228260869565218

There are so many colorful and fun surprises in this DVD that I won't spoil for you, but I will say that it lives up to my high expectations of Dr. Suess movies.

My 5 year daughter has loved the t.v. show for a couple of years and my husband and I always find ourselves tuning in because it's entertaining and we always learn something new. In this festive hour long episode my daughter danced to the music, giggled and learned some new facts. Heck I learned some new things. Who knew that reindeer and caribou were the same animal and that elephants can smell water from very far away?  Always light-hearted, fun and educational!  I highly recommend this and am looking forward to more Cat in the Hat!!!",1351728000,,595,4.60377358490566

4230297,5,B003YKVGKG,Great for any child who loves Cat in the Hat.  This DVD had several episodes that were all entertaining and educational at the same time.  Kept my 2 year old niece occupied for the whole DVD!!  A great DVD for the price!,1343520000,,220,4.190476190476191

4230299,5,B003YKVGKG,"My preschool boy loves this TV show.  He also loves discovering the world around him and this show does a lot of that in a fun rhyming way!  He's also learning rhyming in school so its a winner for him!  It's kind of funny that they gave the little boy, ""Nick"" an ethnic makeover compared to the original character I knew growing up but it doesn't matter. Kids don't care.  And the Mom has an accent too.  Martin Short makes a great cat-in-the-hat and I remember his voice from the Three Amigos movie with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase from back in the 80's.",1322784000,,557,4.3173076923076925
4230300,5,B003YKVGKG,"I bought three of these DVD's for my son. He loves the cat in the hat show on PBS, but it only comes on once a day around his bathtime so he would miss it often. I use these in the portable DVD player or laptop and I also burned a copy to my itunes and put it on my iphone. (literally kept him occupied for 45 mins while we waited at the DMV) Shipping was fast and they were in unopened original casing. (not some bootleg ripoff copy) Good price too, these sell for almost 20$ each at retail stores.",1314662400,2,499,3.9504950495049505
4230301,5,B003YKVGKG,"my daughter (2, almost 3) LOVES these.  they offer a surprisingly rich content and vocabulary.  as someone who is normally not a fan of videos for kids, these are a fantastic exception.",1306886400,,185,4.75
4230302,5,B003YKVGKG,Cat in the Hat with Martin Short is the greatest cartoon since Little Einsteins.  My kids love it.  Great price.,1300060800,2,112,4.55

Does your kid have a Dr. Suess vocabulary??

I may be a bit biased.
I grew up loving Dr. Suess and his zaney vocabulary wonderfulishissness!

But- this one is SOOOOO cute.
Who doesn't think Thing-a-ma-jigger is one of the best words ever?

IN:
The Cat in the Hat Knows a lot About That!
This 60 minute video includes:

Learning about the honey dance and the bees that do it.
The ""migration vacation.""
Nocturnal animals
Animals that travel with their homes AND ants working together. It's a fun and quick moving video that your preschooler can learn lots from.

This new series has Martin Short as the voice of the Cat and will be airing on PBS this fall.",1286928000,,812,4.7304964539007095
4230305,5,B003YKVGKG,"The Cat's voice speaking and singing is catchy.  We watched this DVD twice and my younger daughter (2.5) now sings ""We're gonna go, go, GO on an adventure!"" Both girls pretended that their stuffed animals were migrating after watching the episode on migration. Sure, elephants do not migrate, but I wasn't about to break that news to a two-and-a-half year old. Letting her pretend and use her imagination while incorporating the word migration was amazing to see.

The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That is a program that mixes rhyming, imagination, science, and friendship. As a parent it is important that I teach my children those things.  The creators made a product that is terrific and I hope that is around awhile.  This is a show that we will watch again and again.",1286236800,,776,4.6838235294117645
4230306,5,B003YKVGKG,"We LOVE this DVD! My sons (ages 6 & 8) said they like it because it is funny and my daughter (age 3) said she likes it because of the music. Martin Short as the voice of the Cat is fabulous. My kids have watched the DVD over and over since we got it. I have always loved the book version of The Cat in the Hat - we've been reading it to our kids for years. I think they did an excellent job getting that same ""feel"" in the show. The music is fun and the educational aspect is great. I also really appreciate the fact that the show didn't teach my kids a single insult or unkind word :).  My whole family is happy to recommend The Cat in the Hat Knows A Lot About That! : Wings and Things!",1285200000,7,688,3.8450704225352115
