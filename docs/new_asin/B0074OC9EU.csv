8510189,3,B0074OC9EU,I almost threw it in the trash.  It doesn't load nomally.  I hope I can remember how I was able to open it last time.  Once I get it to work it's 'okay'.,1364169600,,153,3.5757575757575757
8510190,5,B0074OC9EU,I love this cd so much. It is so helpful in explaining about Quickbooks. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn quickbooks. By far the best.,1363132800,,155,4.2
8510191,4,B0074OC9EU,"The way this is formatted is a little confusing.  Got fed up with messing around with it on my DVD player and stuck it into my Mac.  Even then it took me a little while to figure out how to watch the individual videos.  Have to admit I am not exactly a computer genius.  You have to click on each folder individually and then click on the one that says html.  The folders are out of order and I was about ready to scrap this DVD and go another route.  I normally like a classroom style flow. For example the introduction folder is scattered amongst all the other folders on this disk.  But then I figured out the folders which were relevant to me I could save to my computer.  Suddenly I was back in business with this ""dvd"".  It was a big bonus being able save certain parts for future reference.  Again, I am sure many others are more advanced than myself with a computer but I am writing this for dummies like myself. The content is satisfactory.  The guy put quite a bit of work into it but is obviously a low budget operation unlike VTC.  But in the end I did get the information I wanted out of it and was able to save the folders I wanted.  So four stars.  Good job overall.",1356825600,,1181,4.145374449339207
8510192,4,B0074OC9EU,This product is kind of like a book with videos for chapters. You can not just press play and watch a movie. You have to click on each chapter to view it. It would have been nice to have a play all button but then again it would be too long. There is more than 6 hours here at least. You get your money's worth. Some categories do not seem to go too deep like Banking section. It just seems to skim this area though I learned how to upload bank transactions into quickbooks (great trick). I like this product but I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could have as some chapters seem a little rushed to me. Over all I do not feel cheated. A good buy for $$. I learned a lot and since I am not trained as a bookkeeper I needed to learn a lot.,1330732800,6,742,3.8562091503267975
