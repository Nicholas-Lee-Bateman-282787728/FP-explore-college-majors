3795805,5,B001U3D88M,"as the other reviewers have stated, this movie is an absolute visual treat! i had never heard of it, but since it was very nicely priced, i picked it up on a whim and consider this the most well-spent 10.99 ever. It took several viewings to really get an appreciation for the story line as i was so distracted by the stunning imagery. the plot is well-written and enjoyable, but the artistry is amazing. i am stunned, and somewhat envious of the creativity and am hard-pressed to believe that it was computer-generated. there is nothing about this movie that i do not love. even the music is well-done. i cannot recommend this title enough.",1237593600,6,640,4.62280701754386

But this beautiful world is threatened to varying degrees by the dragons of the title, which range in degree of threat from annoying crop stealers to terrifying world devourers, thus the necessity for hunters of same.

Twenty years ago Lord Arnold lost his sight and his health trying to stop the World Gobbler's last rampage, now he impatiently and all but hopelessly awaits the return of the knights he dispatched to try and stop his pending rampage.  So his fairy tale loving niece, Zoe, decides to lend a hand by sneaking out and finding some noble knights like those in her fairy tales, but what she finds are our two hapless heroes.  Can a little girl's belief in them inspire a couple of two-bit, fly-by-night, down-on-their-luck dragon hunters into succeeding where a troop of noble knights failed, into stopping the most horrifying dragon this world has ever seen?

Well, the answer is obvious, but the fun is in how we get there.

Gwizdo and Lian-Chu make for a hilariously mismatched pair, whose widely differing reactions to Zoe, the dragon hunter groupie who is not quite as naive as she appears, threaten to tear their partnership apart,...

assuming of course that anyone survives this fiasco.

I've never read the comic or watched the tv show, or even heard of it before I saw the movie and was completely blown away by everything from the script to the amazing characters but most of all by the imagery.

If ever a film called for a blu-ray release, it would be this one.

Saw it at the store and decided to give it a try in spite of the fact that I've been steering clear of computer animated films lately because of their decline in quality storytelling and visually boring style. Dragon Hunters breaks that trend. This film is SENSATIONAL! So much has been said about the superb visual style and animation and its all true. Stylistically speaking this is one seriously terrific film. Plus you have a great story, exciting nail biting action, life lessons and funny moments all in perfect harmony. No one element outdoes or overshadows another. WHY can't they make MORE computer animated movies like this?! Pixar and the studio that makes despicable me should take notice of this because by and large, all they are creating is animated disasters when they introduce new movies these days.",1451433600,,893,4.920529801324503

Did NOT have high hopes for this film, especially the computer animation, so we were VERY pleasantly surprised!! Amazing computer animation at work here, great story and we loved the different types of dragons as well as the world in which they lived in w/Avatar-like floating islands of land.

Floating worlds with bright and vibrant colors, and then worlds that were falling apart.  When I first stumbled upon this movie I watched it over a dozen times.  Well sometimes I just played it in the background too because it has a great soundtrack and just listening to the story was enjoyable.  It's been over a year now since then and the environment is still very vivid in my mind.  The characters are enjoyable too.

3795952,4,B001U3D88M,"This is based on a TV series which I have never heard of. A French animated film redubbed into English. A very odd film. Not much dialogue. A very beautiful film at least in the extent of the landscapes and backgrounds. Everything is floating in a low gravity world; seemingly a world in ruins and decay, fragments of buildings, floating in the air. Quite wonderful.
  However, the human characters are odd, awkwardly rendered -- and not very successfully. So it is a four star, not a five star rating.
  The story is rather thin and not too clear. How the Silly Dragon was defeated is not made clear. The World Gobbler was destroyed by Lian Chu throwing knitting needles into the World Gobbler's eyes, but what of the Dragon? It seems electricity and conductivity is the key here, as another dragon, the Jimbob Dragon, was defeated by shorting it out -- it was an electric dragon.
  Highly original ideas. Very strange. The French tend to make very odd animated features (Fantastic Planet, Light Years, Azur & Ashnar's Prince's Quest, Persepolis -- all weird films). Visually beautiful; but the story was not successful. Both cliched and with holes in the plot. Lian Chu is the hero who hardly says anything, while his partner Quixbo is essentially a con artist and a coward. They are pushed by Princess Zoe, who has read too many fairy tales and fantasies. She wants a knight to come and slay the World Gobbler and save the world. Quixto is only interested in money; but Lian turns out to be the laconic true warrior type and defeats several dragons. Defeating World Gobbler transforms the landscape from a floating belt of ruined buildings to floating balls of bright green grass. A very odd world, but I suspect there is a science fiction novel somewhere where such a world is described.
  I liked it for the rendering of the landscape not the characters. The characters are ripped from the Fahrd and Gray Mouser characters invented by Fritz Leiber. The story reminds me of any number of Piers Anthony's parodies of fantasy worlds.
  I understand the film was barely released in the USA and chiefly at film festivals. Though made in France it first opened in Russia. Yet another European film that was unable to find a wide release in the USA -- now why is that?",1399680000,,2266,4.685138539042821

3796014,5,B001U3D88M,"All great fan of Disney, Pixar, Dreamwork and other American cartoon makers as I am, I still loved this French-made outsider! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

The French were never very good at Sci-fi or fantasy films, but this rule mostly doesn't apply to child oriented cartoons. ""The mysterious cities of gold"", ""Ulysses 31"", ""Spartakus and the sun beneath the sea"" and the most recent of them ""Dragon Hunters"" are all excellent, original and very well made things.

""Dragon hunters"" the movie is based on highly succesful French-made TV series, but it can be watched and fully understood separately. It tells the story of three ""dragon hunters"" who are hired by a rich young girl, Zoe, to destroy the most ferocious of all dragons - the abominable World Gobbler, who resides at the end of the world, but raides, burns, kills and devours everywhere where it fancies to go. Of all the three ""dragon hunters"" only one, a huge man named Lian-Chu, does the actual dragon killing. Gwizdo, a fast talking street wise short guy, is mostly Lian-Chu's ""agent"" - and also his best friend. The third member of the team is their pet dog-sized dragon named Hector.

The great quality of this film resides first in the visual aspect. The world of ""Dragon Hunters"" doesn't look like ours - it is made of floating islands, some huge, some tiny, connected by all kinds of bridges. Occasionally also some buildings or other features of this world degrade, fall in pieces and are carried away by the winds...

Lian-Chu, who is described as a typical ""gentle giant"", is another treasure of this film. He is now a grown up man, but in his childhood he was once grievously wronged and his heart never healed. This melancholy makes him in a character quite different from those pictured by Pixar or Dreamworks.

The World Gobbler is the third reason to see this film. It is a particularly ferocious creature, inspired I believe at least partly by the dracolich, a monster from Dungeons and Dragons games - albeit this particular specimen is of GARGANTUAN size! WARNING here - because of the appearance of World Gobbler, this film is probably not recommended for children who are not yet seven years old. Believe me - the World Gobbler is such particularly nasty, evil, gigantic, fast, murderous, ugly and deadly customer that it could probably pick up Smaug the Magnificent with one paw and blow his nose into him!

I liked this film a LOT and my then 8-years old daughter liked it too. A recommended viewing. Enjoy!",1376265600,,2515,4.783410138248848

3796037,4,B001U3D88M,"Even if you pride yourself on possessing intimate knowledge of the happenings within the computer generated animated feature film industry, there's a pretty good chance 2008's Dragon Hunters flew well below your proverbial radar.  However, unlike most internationally collaborated films of the genre, this isn't necessarily due to lack of quality.

The feature film being reviewed here is actually the end result of a (52-episode) French cartoon series of the same name that ran from 2006-2007.

Coming in at a runtime of 80-minutes and wearing an appropriate PG rating (for fantasy action, some scary imagery and language), the Dragon Hunters domestic release contains a handful of features including an interview with Forest Whitaker, character biographies, a gallery of the various dragons featured in the film, a look at the Dragon Hunters Universe and an original trailer for the film.

Visually the film manages to outdo its budget in nearly every conceivable category from textures to lighting, from character models to color pallet itself (especially in high definition).  Additionally, and adding to the home theatrical experience, scoring and dialog presented in Dolby 5.1 digital surround is mixed flawlessly.

The story, which is actually far closer to high fantasy than it is a simplistic fairy tale, centers on a young girl named Zoe, who lives under the tyrannical rule of her uncle in a sprawling castle under the constant threat of being shipped off to the convent.  In the meantime her Uncle, Lord Arnold, can only sit back and await the return of the liege of knights he sent out to destroy a dragon so nasty, that it's mere existence prevents the world from coming into bloom.  Sadly each of his returning knights arrive in various states of failure from having been burned to ash to succumbing to madness.

Perhaps the film's greatest strength is in its casting as the slow, monotonous droning of Forest Whitaker (Lian-Chu) is offset brilliantly by the constant fluctuation of Rob Paulsen's animation-staple vocals (Gwizdo).  Add to this mix a small talking dog-like critter (Hector) that could have been lifted directly from Hanna-Barbara and an enthusiastic young girl high on fairy tales and the ensemble plays quite well off one another.

Additionally noteworthy is the English mouth flaps- as in they are spot-on enough to convince the viewer that the dialog was originally recorded in English (it's in fact French in its original form).

The story takes places in a world that exists in the sky, where massive forms of earth and stone float freely and occasionally collide.  It's a technique that's been accomplished frequently in computer animation (Aero Troopers, Kaena the Prophecy) but perhaps never as convincingly and as visually intriguing as it is here.

Where the film falters a bit is in its pacing; which isn't to say that it commits any crimes that would be noticeable by a motion-picture-going audience so much as it possesses none of the snappy polished flow of your average Pixar/ DreamWorks piece.  In fact, this trend could arguably make Dragon Hunters a more appealing piece to a slightly older demographic than that of the projects coming out of the studios mentioned above.  Additionally, while its attempts at humor never actually fail, they are much more subtle and integrated than one typically expects in an animated feature.

All of these elements could be viewed as pros or cons depending on your expectations going into the film.  For me personally, the plot seemed to drag on a bit at about the  mark, due in part perhaps to the fact that the presentation values are so high in the production that the Pixar always-perfect pacing began to feel like a given.  Unfortunately, it never manifests.  The dialog too seems a bit more subdue and snide than is often expected in an animated feature.  Again, perhaps not a bad thing in and of itself but certainly something to be aware of going in.

All in all, it's tough to come away from this film without a deeper appreciation for what goes into creating a computer generated feature from the ground up.  The sheer volume of companies vested in bringing this film to life is staggering.  The end result is quite solid; certainly more enjoyable if viewed from the perspective of an animated fantasy piece not unlike Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal than say, a less-popular alternative to How to Train Your Dragon.  Younger audiences may find the movie-like pacing and lack of cartoony dialog a bit of a trudge to get through but older viewers, especially those with a soft spot for fantasy, will definitely find much to enjoy here.",1368316800,,4627,5.0

3796066,5,B001U3D88M,"This animated film is about a vastly changed world made up of many floating islands, where the two main rules are: eat and don't get eaten. These islands are infested with mutant dragons, which is where the two main characters come in: Gwizdo (Rob Pausen) and Lian-Chu (Forest Whitaker), who are dragon hunters. When these two meet a little girl named Zoe (Mary Matilyn Mouser), she takes them to her rich uncle, Lord Arnold, who sends them on a mission to kill the World Eater, a horrifying dragon that returns every 30 years and wreaks terror and destruction. This dragon hunt sends Zoe, Gwizdo and Lian-Chu and a great adventure. Will they be able to kill the mighty dragon once and for all before it's too late? You will just have to watch and find out.

My favorite character is Hector, the small blue dog-like pet of Gwizdo and Lian-Chu. I like Hector because he is an adorable little creature and he was so unbelievably hilarious. My favorite scene is the scene when Gwizdo starts going insane. I like this scene because it is so funny and hilarious how he freaks Hector and Zoe out. The animation in this film is very well done. For example, the various dragons are very cool and realistic, as are the different characters in this film. The action sequences are thrilling, thanks to the excellent CGI effects. The voice over work is excellent and the different personalities, really come through from the different voices.

This animated film has an excellent story line, is well written and I know everyone will enjoy this entertaining film as much as I. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars because it is very enjoyable, fantastic, and entertaining. I think this film is for ages 6 and up because I know that the younger children might become very afraid in some of the action sequences, but other kids will enjoy the story and the action packed adventure that the three main characters go on.

Nothing has to make sense in this visually dazzling (so much so that it overloads the mind--there's not enough bland breaks to give your mind a rest--and the constantly changing/ rotating/ crumbling/ spinning world is enough to give even the most ADHD addled kid a headache) CGI fairy tale and not much does, including the relationships.  How the good-natured and big-hearted Lian-Chu sticks with the corrupting Gwizdo is not answered and is counter-intuitive.  Speaking of intuitive, I believe that this film is a French production.  Perhaps some of the sensibilities don't translate to an American audience?  I don't know but fear not for though a French production everyone speaks English.  There aren't that many dragons (this film pales in comparison to the slightly similar ""How To Train Your Dragon"") and the pacing of the action is so dog gone quick it is hard to enjoy at times.

It stayed in there for about fifteen minutes. We found stupid, annoying and unwatchable. More accurately, unlistenable. The pictures are pretty. But that's it. Turned it off. Watch it twice?

It was interesting (we guessed on a lot about what was going on) and I can see that it would have been awesome on the big screen. We saw it on a relatively large flat screen and it just didn't strike us as being a technological breakthrough. I judge movies like this quite a bit on whether the kids want to watch it again.  They didn't.  It had a nice theme that we talked about, but I would have just rented this for a one time view.

This is couple of years later and my grandchildren came to the house for their summer visit. I had forgotten all about this movie.  They started asking for this movie and much to my surprise, we found it in my cabinet. I realized they not only had watched it after they saw it at our house, but they had seen it more than once and enjoyed it enough to want to watch it again! So perhaps the problem was more the age of my children the first time we saw it. I didn't like it much the first time I viewed it, but when the grandkids played it for me again, I warmed up to it.

The animation is excellent, and there is a good amount of humor and suspense.  The movie must have been made in Japan and then dubbed for an American audience as some of the characters and buildings have an Asian look.  In fact, it has a couple of Hayao Miyazaki influences.  The main protangonist is a girl, just like in his films, and it has a quirkiness like the floating islands that you might find in one of his films.  There are also moments of silence and reflection that you don't find in American animated movies very often (except for Pixar).  The only negative is the little girl can be a little annoying at times with her CONSTANT talking and singing.

While the actual look of the film in BD format is really impressive the story with the characters seems to be out of place. Two of the main characters look as if they came from different films . One is Gwizdo who looks somewhat proportional being a animated character while his companion Lian-Chu looks as if he came from the film Igor with a tiny head, thoothpick legs but arms and upper torso out of Hulk. The two embark on something like a traveling sideshow of glory conquering Dragons wioth Lian doing the work and Gwizdo thinking of riches.

their ""talents"" are sought and found by Zoe, a neice to a cold stuborn King whose kingdom is threaten by the King of Dragons; World Globbler. The very same one who destroyed Liams village when he was a child. From there it's a adventure of abck and forth between the three ending with a final battle. There's not allot of side stories or characters except hector a Rabbit/Dog something that tags along as a friend and sideshow...no idea why?

The film and sound is really something though. The overall look is really impressive throughout and the sound does shine on several scenes.

Even my husband who usually isn't into animated films unless he has to watch one with our 4 yr old was very impressed.  The story is pretty neat and similar to most ""kill the dragon save the world"" stuff.  What sets it apart was that it was truly visually amazing ( comparable to Avatar ) especially in HD and the musical score that accompanies it was quiet perfect.  This movie had some heart, although the side-kick character tended to annoy me some, but Forrest Whitaker was great.  I loved it so much I had to go buy the Blu Ray IMMEDIATELY ( you really can't beat the price of below $10!!!) and I cannot wait to eventually share it with my daughter and the rest of my family.

But this beautiful world is threatened to varying degrees by the dragons of the title, which range in degree of threat from annoying crop stealers to terrifying world devourers, thus the necessity for hunters of same.

Twenty years ago Lord Arnold lost his sight and his health trying to stop the World Gobbler's last rampage, now he impatiently and all but hopelessly awaits the return of the knights he dispatched to try and stop his pending rampage.  So his fairy tale loving niece, Zoe, decides to lend a hand by sneaking out and finding some noble knights like those in her fairy tales, but what she finds are our two hapless heroes.  Can a little girl's belief in them inspire a couple of two-bit, fly-by-night, down-on-their-luck dragon hunters into succeeding where a troop of noble knights failed, into stopping the most horrifying dragon this world has ever seen?

Well, the answer is obvious, but the fun is in how we get there.

Gwizdo and Lian-Chu make for a hilariously mismatched pair, whose widely differing reactions to Zoe, the dragon hunter groupie who is not quite as naive as she appears, threaten to tear their partnership apart,...

assuming of course that anyone survives this fiasco.

The storm near the end is stunning- the lightning ripping through a large building in the background is so well drawn that I replayed it 5 times, just to take it in!

""Dragon Hunters"" feels like the sort of film you would get if you gave a rather large budget to a bunch of animation film school grad students and told them to go nuts. It's very pretty, but there's only a skeleton of a story to hang onto, and the ""comedy"" is never funny and often disturbing.

Let's drill into the comedy first, and get it out of the way: there isn't any. Nearly all of the ""comedy"" is in the form of body jokes of a strangely suggestive nature - the blind king, when sizing up a potential warrior, isn't convinced of his manliness until he has had a chance to handle the warrior's package. This really isn't, ah, plot relevant, so why was it included here? The stick held over the heroes' heads to get them to complete their mission isn't jail time or anything so mundane - no, it's the threat that if they refuse to complete their mission, they will be ""spanked"" by the king, in public, on their ""bare bottom"". This point is stressed, frequently. At the end, the ""plucky"" girl on the team is threatened with this fate and she is ""saved"" by another, male character being punished in this manner in her place. Seriously, there is a LOT of screen time devoted to discussions of public spankings.

There's also an animal side-kick whose only purpose is to pee little spouts of fire.

The rest of the ""comedy"" is meant to come from the quirky comic relief character, Gwizdo, here voiced by Rob Paulsen, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinky-and-the-Brain/dp/B000FA57HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinky and the Brain</a>&nbsp;fame. You may remember Pinky as having a voice pitched so high and so annoyingly as to give Jar Jar Binks a run for his money. If so, your memory does not deceive you. Because this is a dark! and edgy! film, Gwizdo is a con-man who has no intention of following through on their contract to save the kingdom, but does so anyway because of the Bonds of Friendship. This does not, however, prevent him from going crazy and threatening to strangle a little girl with his bare hands. I digress, though - much of the ""humor"" involves him hoping up and down and screaming in a voice scientifically designed to burst my eardrums that He Does Not Want To Make This Journey. This gets old, fast.

Indeed, I say that much of the humor involves Gwizdo's protestations, but it would be more accurate to say that most of the entire movie centers around this. This really is the most watered-down plot I've seen in awhile: an ancient evil is preparing to wake and ravage the populace, and our heroes are hired to go to his ancient sleeping place and stab him a few times for good measure. They walk there, through a number of surprisingly lovely yet ultimately pointless, worlds; arrive with no strategy in mind; and pull an unlikely win out of their hair, largely because the hero's family was destroyed by the monster when he was a child, and having him kill it is more poetic. Then they all go back home and Gwizdo gets spanked. That is IT. Along the way, there's no story, no plot, just lovely backgrounds and Gwizdo whining at a rate of four complaints per minute.

If you have a specific need to hear Rob Paulsen talk about being spanked in public, ""Dragon Hunters"" is for you, but if you'd like a story with your plot, run away as fast as you can.

3796223,4,B001U3D88M,"In ""Dragon Hunters"" (2009) little Zoe, spunky and perky, enlists the aid of three weird characters in order to hunt down the dragons. Her Uncle Arnold will pay gold to have the beasts eliminated.
The film has great graphics, imaginative, with big hunks of firmament floating around in space. There doesn't seem to be one overall sold piece of ground. There are castles on mountains in the air.
Zoe turns out to be a heroic little girl. It becomes four characters on a quest, on a journey with a mission, a frequent theme in animated movies. This is not, however, in the same league with a lot of the computer animated stuff out there because its storyline is too simplistic, not highly original or inspired, and the characters are too one-dimensional. They seem to have no history behind them.
Forest Whitaker's voice is that of cloddish Lian-Chu, but his voice is not that distinctive nor quirky enough, not the easily recognizable voice of some other personalities. Lian-Chu's buddy-in-arms is Gwizdo, the operator and scam artist. Hector is the blue rabbit, but no great thought or creative energy went into the making of these cardboard characters.
The movie has some comic elements but not enough.
The big hulk central character and his three little friends are often jumping from one clump of floating earth to another, but for little purpose.
The big guy, Lian-Chu, knits garments which seems foolish to his buddy, but it turns out that the knitting needles are potent weapons against dragons who seem to be  dull, ineffective, unawe-inspiring monsters.

I went in with no expectations or maybe a bit of a negative impression as this is from an unknown publisher and I  wasn't sure if the animation or storuy was going to be good or not (being used to dreamworks and pixar films) Well all I can say was that I was Pleasantly Surprised at how good this movie truly was.  The animation was on par with that of most others I have seen from the above mentioned companies and the story was also.  I kept waiting for the story to turn boring or lame and it did not. It kept me interested from beginning to end and I would say that this movie was at least as good as that of a major company. It had some humor, some cuteness, some sadness and some happiness overall if I could give this movie 6 STARS I would. Just for the fact that it was not made by a major studio, but yet was on par with same. VERY NICE and I look forward to many more good movies from this same studio.  Note: Some parents may be offended by the king grabbing the hero's crotch area (once)and by the use of the word ""piss"" (once) but these are the only 2 instances that I noticed that may not be ""kid worthy."" you will have to decide for yourself, but overall GREAT MOVIE.",1259712000,2,1240,4.069672131147541

3796249,5,B001U3D88M,"I watched what I could of the original cartoon. And when I saw that a movie was made, I though it was going to be quaint and cute. But I didn't think it was going to be great. I thought just like many cartoon CG movies, it was going to be amusing but that's about it. Once the menu loaded up, I got the first impression that something different was going on. The sound quality was thick and the surround sound even on my cheep speakers was gripping. Then the actual movie started, and all preconceptions fell to the ground. The movie is DE-TAILED. And beautiful! The vision of the backgrounds of the show were amplified by the merciless CGI.

Another thing in this movie is a great beating heart. Care is all over this picture. Most CG animated DVD movies get the job done, but there is not much to get attached to. This move is detailed even between the lines.

Forest Witaker did a great Lian Chu. His deep voice fit. This is an AWESOME movie. Not just for kids, anyone, open to it, would enjoy this movie to pieces. Absolute recommend.",1258329600,38,1038,4.345360824742268

We started out watching it with our 2 and nearly 4 year old and they had a hard time once it got really dark and more dragon hunting.  But, it's a PG rating and should have known better.  With that being said, my husband and I really did enjoy it.  The world that was created was incredible and my husband and I were fascinated with the animation.  The fact that it is so different than the standard Disney Pixar stuff we usually watch really got our attention.  We thought the voice talents were great and we really enjoyed the score of the movie.  Kind of made us think of Chinese techno at times.  I hadn't heard of this movie until it popped up on Amazon as a pre-order and had several wonderful reviews.  I'm glad I took a chance with a movie unknown to us.

3796252,5,B001U3D88M,"If the Oscars had such a category ""Dragon Hunters"" would win; as it is the movie was considered for best animated feature of 2008 but was overshadowed by Disney and Dreamworks products. More unfortunately, it has never found a theatrical distributor in the U.S., so many of us (including myself) are ""discovering"" it on DVD and Blu-ray.

This is the finest 3D animation, and story, and music, I have seen anywhere. It is visually imaginative, witty, and even has an admirable moral or two. It is one of those creations which make you respect the motion picture form as transcendent, where now and then (but not often) the whole is greater than the parts, where a bevy of extremely talented artists and technicians have been motivated to coalesce their efforts. Basically a European production originating from a French cartoon series, the film has been 100% adapted to the American viewer (voices well recast and reanimated). The mortar of the bricks is the music composed by Klaus Badelt and performed by the Munich Symphony Orchestra, with an added interlude by Jalan Jalan. Alas, 80 minutes is not enough, I'm sure you will agree. P.S.: The Blu-ray version is stunning!

Not all European animated features are wonderful; the ""Dragon Hunters"" DVD contains a preview from Peace Arch Entertainment of ""Donkey Xote"" from (naturally) Spain. The donkey character has been swiped 100% from the ""Shrek"" movies, and many critics say the script is awful. The DVD trailer makes one appreciate ""Dragon Hunters"" all the more.",1255737600,2,1515,5.007936507936508

The dragon hunter world takes place on the edge of the world, A floating  sea scape of shards of land, each one different from the next.  Incredible dragon. How come no one has heard of this movie. Its just amazing.",1255564800,,289,4.72
3796274,5,B001U3D88M,"Animation is hard because (a) the characters have even less time and human nuances with which to develop actual character, much less engage in character development, and (b) because directors and writers seem to believe that a few stock hints will suffice to create a believable character. This movie avoids those traps and delivers a surprisingly well-done plot and film.

This movie is not just well-animated (it is), not just visually detailed and plainly gorgeous (it is). The characters are actually interesting and placed into an interesting and slightly surreal plot and universe. The combination is amazing.

I watched it with my daughters (6 and 8). Generally acceptable, although one species of dragon engages in self-propulsion through its backside emissions and the worst language in the film occurs when one of the characters calls another a ""bu**wipe"". There are a few booger references. Additionally, two or three times during the film the sidekick dog-like character of the protagonist quartet demonstrates its ability to start a fire with its urine. I'm not fond of potty humor (especially with the risk that my 6 year old will sing out lines from the movie for days) but while it's there it's much more minimized than the Shrek movies. If your little girl dreams of being a princess who also goes on quests and helps fight dragons, they'll love this movie. Likewise, the main protagonist is an admirable hero who grows throughout the movie and would provide an excellent dragonslayer motif for boys.

Bottom line is that this movie is a keeper. After I finished watching it with my daughters, my wife got home from the gym and, after putting the kids to bed, I watched it again with my wife. Notably, my wife also thought it was excellent, again commenting on character development and the extraordinary scenery and animation.

Voice over work is very well done. Dialogue is smart and appropriate for both kids and adults.,1250035200,,264,5.0227272727272725
3796296,5,B001U3D88M,"I am a 37 year old Mom of two little ones, and I just finished watching this movie, it was EXCELLENT!! Visually stimulating the story never dragged, it sucked you right in. It is PG though, I would be wary for wee little ones, towards the end of the movie there was a couple of possible ""scarey"" scenes, but my 3 year old was fine with it. I am going to recommend this movie to everyone!!!",1249862400,,389,4.131578947368421
3796297,3,B001U3D88M,"For the price, I was impressed with this blu-ray. The animation is very good and I would definitely recommend it. Great for kids or lovers of computer animation.",1249171200,5,161,4.785714285714286
3796298,5,B001U3D88M,"I purchased this movie after reading the other positive reviews on Amazon.  The quality is great, and the entertainment value is high.  My 4 yr old daughter watches this mover over and over, it is in her primary lineup of movies for the moment.",1247961600,,244,4.5227272727272725
3796299,2,B001U3D88M,"It has a decent storyline with buyable characters. The graphics are very good, but they depict a dark and unrealistic environment, lacking color and life. It is just too gloomy graphically speaking.",1246233600,2,198,5.21875
3796300,5,B001U3D88M,"What a great family movie! I had never actually even heard of it until my daughter showed me at the store today! What a nice surprise. I suspected it would be another lame animated movie, with the same storylines and jokes. But it was very good! Very action packed for a child's movie. The ending was enjoyable and the characters were funny. My daughter, who is 7, really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great ""family movie night"" choice!",1246060800,,463,4.523809523809524
3796301,5,B001U3D88M,"An underdog of a film, but the question of how the Blu transfer would turn out was being asked since the announcement this year. In brief summary, it turned out great.

We have a story of fantasy, peril, comic relief, bravery and action all set against a beautiful world where gravity has a much different outcome. The picture clarity looked amazing. There are brief blips in the motion here and there, but overall the quality turned out vivid, crisp and articulate. Reference the wide pan shots where the characters are extremely small; on the DVD they were little blips, on the Blu they were distinguishable with arms and legs.

The sound was outstanding. All five channels are used extensively, and it appears no imagination was spared on how to make these floating villages and action sequences surround you.

The special features are catered to the kids who follow stories like this with trading cards and such. The Universe of DH, Character Biography and Dragon Gallery options can be surfed through like reading a book on all the creatures and locations we just watched. The Interview With Forest Whitaker lasts less than five minutes and shows the production process of recording in studio.

I have not watched the original series, but I hope they continue with more films of this quality and story. For the parents wondering on content, the PG rating on language is for fart stuff, the fantasy action and scary images will most likely be scary for 6 and under. But between the music, scope of pictures and action I was noticing kids younger than that loving it as it played today.",1245456000,28,1589,4.788321167883212
3796302,5,B001U3D88M,"My 6 year old son borrowed this movie from my brother and I was a bit skeptical, assuming it would be a second rate children's animated movie.  We started watching it and I was immediately impressed with just the images.  Beautiful, creative and fantasy like.  The story was great, the characters lovable and had a very nice message that wasn't delivered with too much sugar.
I am certainly purchasing this dvd for our family collection!",1239321600,6,437,4.8

As if this was perfectly normal, the three main characters roam through this gravity-challenged planet, searching for clients.  They are dragon hunters.  And they are almost as good at this job as they claim.  But accidents will happen.  Joining their merry band is a knight obsessed little girl named Zoe, she inspires them to greater heights.........whether they wanted to or not.  Its a quest.  Kill the World Eater and get paid.
