8313016,4,1935515861,"My daughter 3, will be attending French kindergarden so I have been looking for ways to get her interested in learning the language.  I took a gamble on buying the 6 DVD set and am so glad we did.  The characters and images hold my daughter's attention and she wants to watch them repeatedly.  Even my 1 year old is mesmerized.  I enjoy it too.

The pronunciation and level of repetition is good - and I like that it is immersion, with the French phrase shown on screen so you can see the spelling and accents.  English subtitles are shown too.  The cartoon characters are cute, but the bulk of the DVD shows real babies/kids/parents in action - which I prefer.  They show both genders and are multicultural.

Here are my minor complaints: 1) There is too much repetition of vocabulary between the DVDs.  Repetition is good, but learning how to say ""cuddles"" or that the dog barks and wags his tail should only be on one DVD.  2) Verbs are conjugated using il, elle, ils but only occasionally with ""je"" when Pim says it (never tu or vous).  Je seems important, but I guess the format would need to change or Pim would have to do more talking in the cartoon part of the DVD.  3) Still expensive at $16 per DVD even in the boxed set, but less expensive than others like Prof. Toto or Muzzy which we haven't tried for that reason.

Overall, I would certainly buy this set again, but I am left feeling like there should be about six more DVDS since I can think of hundreds of basic things I'd still like my daughter to learn.  I am glad though that this set has increased her interest in learning which means I can do a lot more on my own.",1302393600,,1635,4.2973856209150325
