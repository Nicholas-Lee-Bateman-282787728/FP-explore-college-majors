8597053,1,B00DSAUGW6,"Really crap, don't waste your time. I'm guessing the good reviews are from friends and family of the cast/crew.",1514764800,,111,4.894736842105263
8597054,1,B00DSAUGW6,"Everything about this movie was just terrible. The writing, the performances, the production values ... The only saving grace was that the gore was pretty well done.",1514505600,,165,5.148148148148148
8597055,1,B00DSAUGW6,Another Amazon junk movie that you'll wish you had your 1 minute of life back that it took to realize how this movie horribly made.,1514246400,,131,4.28
8597056,1,B00DSAUGW6,"Horrible movie, boring plot and a bad script make this movie cringe worthy.",1513987200,,75,4.846153846153846
8597057,5,B00DSAUGW6,"This movie was better than what the title implied. One look at the title and I thought it would be just another slasher type movie with no real merit. However, this one was different.  As a horror/psychological thriller type fan it took me at least three-quarters of the way through the movie to figure out what the twist would be to the film; and that's saying something. I gave it a five. The acting was good as well.",1513382400,,419,4.371794871794871

8597059,5,B00DSAUGW6,"I won't give away the plot like others did but I will say I liked this movie.  Now the catch is you have to watch it all the way to the end.  My whole thought thru most of the movie was Why??? But it ties it up in the end and the reason I gave it 5 stars is because I could not guess what was going on until the end.  Usually I have t figured out in the first 10-30 minutes.  So kudo's to the people who wrote this.  Most of the film is mediocre but to me, this film is a little gem.  :)",1511654400,3,487,3.547169811320755
8597060,1,B00DSAUGW6,Another bad tittie horror (?) movie.,1508889600,3,36,5.166666666666667
8597061,2,B00DSAUGW6,I didn't like Black Eve. It had an interesting concept with the girl having multiple personalities. But because it is on such a low budget and because this is supposed to be a slasher movie. I don't think the concept was used to its best potential.,1425600000,3,248,4.413043478260869
