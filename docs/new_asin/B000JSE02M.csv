2678915,5,B000JSE02M,I highly recommend this instructional video to anyone wishing to learn swing dancing. I bought this video as a gift for my son and his wife who are interested in learning to swing dance. My wife and I like to think we are good swing dancers but we learned a few things from this beginners set and plan to purchase the more advanced videos for ourselves. I have purchased other dance videos; however I think Shawn Trautman's method of teaching is superior to any of the other videos that I have purchased.,1168992000,5,504,4.489130434782608
2678916,5,B000JSE02M,"I really loved this DVD.  As I currently know how to do basic swing dance moves, this tape helped me add ""color"" to my swing dancing ability.  This tape begins by a short review of the basic swing dance steps and then moves quickly into more advanced dance steps. Each new move is shown first, then broken down into parts, allowing the viewer to perfect each dance step before moving onto the next one.  Get this DVD if you want to shine on the dance floor!",1167264000,6,457,4.290697674418604
2678917,5,B000JSE02M,"My wife and I are new to ballroom dancing in the last year.  We've taken some lessons, but found that we needed the extra help of videos that we can use on our own schedule in our home and we've tried a bunch of them.  This DVD and the whole series of new videos from Shawn Trautman have been a godsend and much more useful to us than the others we've tried.  We are actually doing the dances within a short time and having fun, rather than getting aggravated with one another.  Trautman's emphasis on the differing roles of leader and follower and the very clear demonstrations of those roles have helped us enormously.  These DVDs include much more music and time to practice the new steps than most videos, rather than just watching an instructor do a step and go to another step.  We like this video a lot and strongly recommend it.  On a side note, the logistics/timing of shipping and subsequent email communications with the company were, after many frustrations with other online outfits, the best we've seen.",1165276800,5,1017,4.585635359116022
2678918,5,B000JSE02M,"THIS DVD PICKS UP WHERE VOLUNE 1 LEFT OFF.

THE MOVES ARE VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO FOLLOW.

WHAT YOU LEARN IN THIS ONE MAKES THE DANCE

EVEN MORE INTERESTING.THE MUSIC IS REALLY GREAT,

THE BEAT IS RIGHT ON.A GREAT ONE TO HAVE.ENJOY

2678919,5,B000JSE02M,"Swing Volume 2 is just as good as a standalone as it is to a supplement to volume 1. If you've been swing dancing a couple times already and have the basic steps down from a couple free lessons at the clubs, then this is the DVD you will be using the most. I had someone try to teach me the tuck turns and wraps, but the instruction wasn't nearly as good as how I found it on this DVD.

It's almost 90 minutes of quality lessons which typically cost 4-5 times as much in a live environment. This is definitely a wise purchase for someone wanting to learn in the privacy of their own home.

My personal favorite part was being able to do all the moves in synch with Shawn & Joanna at the end of each lesson.",1164585600,11,706,4.035714285714286
8152808,5,B000JSE02M,"Shawn and Joanna are great teachers! This is the 5th CD we've purchased from them, and we have yet to be disappointed. It is wonderful to do our embarrassing first dance steps in our own kitchen, rather than in public. I would very much recommend their CD's to anyone learning to dance, even if they start, as we did, at a very elementary level!",1513555200,,345,4.40625
8152809,5,B000JSE02M,"This Swing Dancing for Beginners Volume 2 is as good, or even better than Volume 1.
Based on the above, am now ordering Intermediate Vol. 1.",1503273600,,140,4.423076923076923
8152810,2,B000JSE02M,I bought volumes 1 and 2.  The two videos pretty much over the basic step and an under arm turn.  The quality of the video is poor.,1463702400,,131,3.814814814814815
8152811,5,B000JSE02M,It is good,1414195200,,10,2.6666666666666665
8152812,5,B000JSE02M,"Everyone started at the same level, but most people just take a one hour lesson, once a week, and never practice. They are not making much progress, from one week to the next. We rotate partners throughout most of the evening, to prevent bad habits from being reinforced with no outside experience, and to give everyone a chance to learn from other students, and the teacher, who rotates throughout the group in both leader and follower positions. For me, dancing with women with NO TONE is like dancing with JELLO, and it was terribly frustrating for me, in the beginning. Thanks to your videos, I am becoming a strong enough leader to reinforce my own skills, even with a weak partner who really needs strong clues to follow the next move, and I am able to genuinely help others in the class. Just last night, another strong male dancer made a special point to compliment my normal dance partner, who also studies your videos, as being the best female dancer in the class, which helps him learn during partner rotations. Our greatly accelerated improvement in class is thanks to your videos!",1391731200,,1093,4.727748691099476
8152813,4,B000JSE02M,"Some os the steps and routines nwere done too fast to follow.  Other than that, I appreciate the instruction as I hope to go get some lessons at a local establishment and don't look rediculous.",1362355200,,193,4.514285714285714
8152814,5,B000JSE02M,"If I could only afford to buy one video out of the swing series this would definitely be the one since it was simple enough for me to understand without any experience and had enough variety of moves to keep my partner and I fully occupied and having fun on the dance floor.  Whether you want to build onto what you learned in Beginner's Swing Volume 1, or you already know the basic steps and just want to add some flare to your dance, the Beginner's Swing Volume 2 video is essential.  This video covers pretty much all the standard swing moves you'll see on the dance floor and then some.  The moves are taught in group segments that build onto each other and are then used in combinations.  The instructors start by teaching each simple 4 step move, and then each new move starts where the previous one ends allowing you to transition into your own endless sequences of spins, turns, hand changes, wraps, and touchbacks.  As with Volume 1 everything is broken down step by step and Shawn gives tips to the leader while Joanna gives tips to the follower along the way.  Five stars plus!",1305504000,2,1089,4.474747474747475
8152815,5,B000JSE02M,"Buy this along with Beginners Volume 1 and you will be swinging by midnight.  This is a fun couple dancing a fun dance. Just watching the DVD for entertainment purposes makes me smile. The Trautman's were born to teach dance, and they do it better than anyone else I have seen. They are not about showing you how good they are at dancing, instead they are about teaching you how to dance well and look good on the dance floor. The speed and repetition in this DVD is easy to follow. Miss a step?  No need to stop, rewind, and replay; Shawn and Joanna are going to show it to you again and again, with verbal instructions each step of the way, and views from multiple angles. Learning all the new steps is addictive, and before you know it, it's midnight, and you have watched (and learned) the entire DVD. Load in the the Intermediate DVD, and keep going into the wee hours. Single-time and triple-time swing are included with enough steps, turns, belly-rubs, kick steps, and back touches to keep you and your dance partner amused all night at the next swing party.",1190678400,6,1065,4.484536082474227
8152816,5,B000JSE02M,"Other than dancing with my son at his wedding, I am a dancing ""newbie""--so green that I was reluctant to go to a dance class! I have wanted to learn to dance for many years but never had a partner so I decided to take matters into my own hands and begin with DVD instruction. I made several unsuccessful phone calls with various suppliers until I happened upon Shawn Trautman's order department. An operator helped me personally select the first two DVD's to suit my needs and then long-story-short, I have purchased 12 DVD's to date. I received a personal email follow-up making sure that I had received the DVD's and that I was satisfied.

Shawn Trautman's teaching style is comprehensive and clear allowing for plenty of practice time within the lesson. The DVD format has all chapters clearly labeled allowing for precise access to a desired spot in the lesson. He and his wife, Joanna, give the lessons with plenty of tips for men on how to lead effectively and for the women, how to follow responsively...also provided are the much-needed tips on how to look stylish and confident as you take your first steps on the dance floor. It's great for us who fit into the ""fake it 'til you make it"" category!

I was cautioned by dancing friends to make sure the instruction I received was accurate as to avoid learning faulty technique. I have learned enough at home to Swing dance with several different partners and I have been complimented on my technique when I confess that I am a beginner. Thanks for the great product!",1180742400,3,1524,4.640740740740741
8152817,5,B000JSE02M,"Great teaching style, easy to understand, clear videos of just what you need to see.  Bought this one because I could see a demo online first.  We've taken private ballroom lessons for several years, and thought this DVD would give us a few new patterns.  Our only disappointment was that the pattern names Shawn uses differ from the ones we learned, so there wasn't much new material for us.  Wish we'd gotten the Intermediate instead (and probably will buy more).",1173312000,6,465,4.775
