7922294,1,B00004T3AU,"if this was real footage it would be considered a ""snuff film"" which is illegal in America, that being the case, it couldn't be sold on Amazon if it was real.

also, there's 8 sequels. There's no way it's real.

this entire piece of crap is staged and home-made.",1291593600,,262,4.326530612244898
7922295,2,B00004T3AU,"A very cheap DVD in price and quality. Lots of gore including plane crashes, shootings, warfare, ad infinitum. However, not much of what is shown is well filmed or even interesting.

For example, there is a video in which a woman taped herself murdering her husband, but for the 45 second duration of the film, about 5 seconds of it are visible whatsoever. The rest is pitch black. The same goes for much of the footage here. SOME of the footage is filmed relatively well (enough so to please the gore enthusiast), but don't expect much. I spent $2 on this DVD, and got exactly what I paid for.

Why the two star rating, you ask? Well, my copy has the sound out of synch with the film quite severely (about a twenty second delay) which seriously effects many of the scenes.

This DVD is quite a mixed bag, so buyer beware.",1112572800,2,822,4.394736842105263
7922296,3,B00004T3AU,"I have been an avid collector of extreme gore and shockumentary films for upward of 12 years. Now this film provides what a person who is even looking here would want to see,the death the bodies etc. But be warned much of the footage is usually being filmed after said deaths have already happened but there are exceptions. All in all i would say that this would be a good addition to your collection but is in no means as rare or as extreme as say death the ultimate horror or the faces of gore series.",1075334400,2,503,4.25
