I also thought the time period of the interviews would coincide with Berlin days but they are just interviews where Bowie or Iggy mention ""Berlin"".

David Bowie: The Berlin Briefings is an 84 minute DVD that captures a series of interviews mainly from the Starman but there are also contributions from the likes Iggy Pop (a prominent 70s partner in performance) and the producer Tony Visconti who was also a vital cog in the musical merchandise of Bowie in that decadent decade. A lot of the chat centres around the productive period of 1976-79 when Bowie delivered the masterpieces-Low, Heroes and Lodger while also being central to the phenomenal Iggy albums-The Idiot and Lust for Life.
Bowie is candid about a variety of topics-and, it is evident that the Berlin experience was to prove to be profitable as both critical and commercial entities. A number of factors played a part in this section of his stimulating story, e.g.
*A Separation from a reliance on pharmaceuticals
*Departing American residency (and the negative lifestyle that settlement had created)
*A sojourn to a new European base and one of particular cultural craft
*Linking up with Iggy
*New working collaborators (in particular Brian Eno and Robert Fripp).
*Liaising with Visconti
*Forging a new creativity, and
*Burying himself in a hectic work schedule.
All of the above and other positivity paid dividends for his health and wealth.
Bowie is a sponge to a burgeoning number of influences from different cultures, traditions and various musicians and he salutes the majesty of electro pioneers Kraftwerk and he salivates over the yet to break Devo.
Bowie claims that he is not in rock n roll and that fame is not his aim but all of the times it is just work to him. He also clears up a few misconceptions and puts the record straight with a variety of interviewees to make for another essential piece of a jigsaw that will never be complete even though the Blackstar of David Bowie has sadly departed this mortal coil.",1460678400,,1902,4.879256965944273
