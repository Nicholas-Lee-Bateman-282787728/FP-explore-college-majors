1823624,3,B000083C4Z,"Ever since the first three films (Dead ZOne, Tree of Might, World's strongest) the Dragon Ball Z movies have been relegated to nothing but 45 minute shorts.  Some actually fit into the story line (Coolers Revenge, Bardock, History of Trunks) while the others were just like in an alternate universe.  This fits into the Alternate Universe.
It's hard to guess when this one should of taken place, but guesssing from the way it is done, the story starts off after Cell, or before the Cell Games.  Goku and GOhan are out shopping with CHiCHi one day, while Roshi, Krillian, OOlong, and Future Trunks are standing in a line hopping to get into a fashion show.  They are the only ones in this line.  Soon a set of androids appear, one looking like a fairly traditional warrior and the other a seventies reject.  After a brief amount of Chaos GOku and Trunks lure them away from the city and towards the Artic.  GOhan and Krillian soon follow.  While they are battling the Androids constantly seem to get the upper hand.  Then Vegeta and Piccolo show up.  The three sayjins go into Super Sayjin mode and soon really heat things up.  Androids 14 and 15 are soon destroyed.  Android 13 seems to be in a losing battle until he absorbs androids 14 and 15 (Just like Cell) and transforms into this blue hulking beast that is seemingly indestructable.  HE takes out everyone until Goku starts to gather energy for the Spirit BOmb, and well I won't spoil the ending but it defies certain rules in the DBZ universe.
This one unfortunatly is the worse of the lot thus far.  The battle sequences were OK but really went very far.  The fact that it should take place after Cell causes some problems (Most specifically why Gohan does not goe Super Sayjin 2, or even level one for that matter) the androids lacked personality, except for 13 who sounded like a Trucker.  End result is that this is definetly for Fans, but even Die HArd fans will see the problems that this has involving the universe.  Especially in the end.",1045008000,,2004,4.584269662921348
1823625,1,B000083C4Z,"Why does Funimation make it 4:3 when the movie was oringinally 16:9, it was widescreen when i bought the tape from japan. But the movie is good anyway, i like the part when Goku sucks in the sprit bomb and destroy's #13",1044662400,,219,4.238095238095238
1823626,4,B000083C4Z,"Right to the point, this movie is great.  Even the dubbed has its moments, and that's rear.  The original is great, but surprisingly, its on the level with the dubbed, as far as quality is concered.  This is mostly because there isn't as much dialog in this movie as the others.  The only edge the dubbed has is the voice they did for Android 13.  In the attire he is wearing, its not to surprising that the original couldn't really capture the voice of a southern truck driver.  The original version, however, gets two points for slightly better music and less use of corny jokes.  I'd get this one for both versions (but more for the original).  So, if you want to see three Super Saiyans fight, see the other version of how Trunks broke his sword, or watch one of the only groin shots in DBZ, then I recomend this movie ...",1044316800,,826,4.352941176470588

1823634,5,B000083C4Z,"Okay, so you're reading my review for 'Dragonball Z:  Super Android 13'.  I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed anime and especially those who enjoyed the action genre of anime.  There are some comedic moments to break up the action in this anime so it doesn't get monotonous.  Of course, if you don't like the Dragonball Z series, you probably shouldn't be bothering with this movie.  The box says it's rated 13 and up and it's my opinion that's it's more than safe to allow kids to watch this anime.  It's relatively tame stuff.  Anyways, this DVD release of the movie contains 3 uncut versions, one of them being the original japanese version with subtitles.  This is a big bonus because I absolutely hate it when they edit and cut anime.  The anime itself is about 46 min. according to the box.  Well, that's about it.  If you want to know what this movie is about you should look up a synopsis of it.  If you're not a Dragonball Z fan, I would say rent it before you decide to buy it (I bought it and I'm not unhappy, but I'm a DBZ fan and you might not be.).",1182384000,,1092,4.299019607843137

1823636,3,B000083C4Z,"This movie was highly bastardized by Funimation.

Its a good movie, its just been tampered with by Funimation in many annoying ways. Hardcore and Real fans of the series won't enjoy it too much. Casual fans will eat it up, but thats cool, because its a very entertaining flick.

I give it 3 stars. Because I like the movie, but had trouble watching it in English. When I switched tot he Japanese I realized the subtitles were highly inaccurate as you will read further. And thats what hurts the score of this movie.

And what shall follow is my gripefest. with some light spoilers near the end..

Dialogue was added in many scenes where there was none spoken in the original japanese version. Or the dialogue was changed.

I understand enough Japanese to know the dubbed script and subtitles didn't fit much at all.

And this is truly sad too. The subtitles are a scripted version of the dub script. and  thus do not fit as translations to the Japanese version if you watch it that way. Highly unjust.

It is funny sometimes though. Subtitles will keep appearing during silent moments if you watch the japanese version, and you realize that Funimation made their own dialogue and script for the movie.

The subtitles should have been a translation of the Japanese dialogue. That is what they are there for.

Also, Super Android 13, never speaks in the japanese version, but in the dub, anytime he is faced away from camera, or you can't see his face off camera, they add dialogue for him or others. Why?

And what is with the ridiculous redneck trucker voice for android 13? I understand that he does appear that way, but is that so neccessary? They also had him call goku ""plum loco"" thats just ridiculius. why not just use the actual dialogue, correctly translated. I really Hate Funimation.

The Music was ok as far as DBZ goes. Not as Techno or Rock n Roll as they do it for the series or other movies. They have gotten better with that.

Here is a perfect example of a non translation. (Spoiler Alert)

When Android 13 is being killed by the Spirit Bomb or Genki Dama if you prefer it, he is screamign out ""Son Goku!""

in the subtitles and dub, he is yelling out something along the lines of ""You must die""

Also people mentioned the fish joke at the end of the movie. That is another one of those added thigns where nothign was really being said. Much the same way they gave Dr. Gero's computer a voice. Unneeded dialogue added for no real reason, other than the fact that they can...",1137196800,4,2490,4.512249443207127
1823637,3,B000083C4Z,"When I saw this movie, Dragonball Z: Kyokugen battle!! San dai super saiyajin (Dragonball Z movie 7: Super Android 13) I thought it would be interesting. Instead, all I got was 3 androids kicking Goku and Trunks's asses. My fav movie in the DBZ series is Movie 13 (exploding dragonball fist). If you want to find out more about the androids and how Android 13, 14 and 15 merge into Super 13, be my guest.",1126828800,,404,4.4
1823642,4,B000083C4Z,"Movie 7 on DVD, sweeet. Movie 7 by itself as a weak story, but the story was already laid in the episodes. And the story isn't what shines in this movie...

Audio 2.5/5 - There was nothing particularely wrong with the audio, but once again, Funimation fails to put it in stereo. We only get regular mono for this one yet again, which is really poor for a DVD release.

Video - 5/5 - The video quality was flawless. Funimation this time, has not messed with the picture like they do in some of the episodes. Next, I have to addresss the widescreen issue. All 13 Dragonball Z movies were in fact, created in FULLSCREEN. However, they were first released in Japanese theatres. So Toei Animation cut out some of the picture to make them widescreen. Then, once released on VHS, they took the chopped up widescreen version instead of the original fullscreen. Funimation, however, recieved the originals from Toei, and now, for the first time ever, we can see the original un-chopped movies, which is great. I admit the widescreen versions seem alot better because it makes it feel more like a movie, but the movies were originally fullscreen. If you search around the web you can find screens comapring the DVD with the original vhs widescreen version to see the chopped off difference. So, that's that.

Subtitles - 2.5/5 - The subtitles in here are okay. No major screw ups, they just use saiyan instead of saiya-jin (though they use all the rest of the japanese nomenclature) and Goku says ""ain't"" one too many times. It really, really ruins Goku's character when I hear him say that. ""aren't"" ""isn't"" and ""I'm not"" are all replaced with that horrible word. The rule should be, if you can't speak proper english in the first place, don't do enlgish subtitles. The subtitles in say, movie 1 were perfect. SO they should really get the old translater back, or just ask Toei for a copy of the script in english.

Story/Action - 4/5 - I love this movie. The story is weak, but it's about the androids, so we already know the story. What shines is the fight scenes. They're absolutely beautifull. I think this movie has some of the the best fight scenes ever made in the entire Dragon Ball series. Perfect balance between their use of ki, and old school fighting. Amazing ending as well, one of the best movie endings. I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet, but this is one Genki-dama and pissed off Goku you won't want to miss.

Overall, 4/5 stars this one gets. If it wasn't for the audio and slight subtitle screw ups, it would be 5/5. I'd reccomend it to those who have the original VHS as well.",1097539200,7,2603,4.541577825159915

1823646,3,B000083C4Z,"I thought this movie was OK, but the ending was no good. The movies should be at least 2 hours long so we can get a little bit passed the typical ""Vegeta gets his butt kicked and Goku uses same old technique to beat invincible bad guy"" story. But I am posting this to say that one of the below reviewers said that Goku's screams were best in the Japanese version.
It must have been sarcasm because Goku sounds like a little school boy when he's screaming in the Japanese version. What's so hard core about that? Not to mention the horrible 60's Godzilla music that comes along with the Japanese version. Ugh. HOrrible. Only thing the Japanese version has is a few swear words here and there.... but it's not worth sitting through 60 minutes of monotonous voices that detract from the true DBZ potential.
I think I'll stick to the English dubbed version where Goku sounds like a man and Vegeta doesn't sound like an onld Japanese guy trying to sound tough.
I'm going to watch the Japanese version of Goku going SS for the first time. GOku sounded like a maniac losing it when he was transforming in the enlgish version. I wonder how he'll sound in the Japanese version. My guess is that there will be Godzilla music in the background from the early 1960's with Goku making a ""kkkk-kkkkkk-kkkkk"" sound from his throat. Yawn.",1065052800,4,1322,4.535564853556485
1823647,4,B000083C4Z,"Dragonball Z isn't deep philosophy, but it sometimes has surprising little twists and turns that take it beyond the nonstop buttkicking festival that it appears to be.
  This is NOT the case in Movie 7 (called ""The Three Super-Saiyajin"" in Japan). However, as a basic quick intro to the characters and the power levels of DBZ, Movie 7 is actually one of the best and most enjoyable of the Dragonball Z movie series. As actual stories, I prefer movie 2 (""The World's Strongest"", featuring a mad scientist and his super-technological creations against the Z-team) and the double bill of 5 and 6 (the ""Cooler"" movies). The Three Super Saiyajin, however, is just a more FUN movie. No real wasted time; we set up our heroes in nice calm settings, and then send some nasty androids to attack them, letting the action continue until the very end.
This movie also features two of the ""coolest entrances in Anime"" sequences: one for Vegita, one for Piccolo. Well worth the watching. If you like DBZ, or if you'd like one mindless-but-fun anime combat fest to watch, grab this one.",1064880000,11,1071,4.752688172043011
1823648,5,B000083C4Z,"I watched this movie years ago, uncut and in the original Japanese. The story (what little there is) was simple enough to figure out without needing a translation. Diehard fans of the American series should keep in mind the movies are only loosely tied with the television series, and don't tie in directly with the television series continuity.
That being said, this movie contains the best fight sequences, character design and animation the series has to offer. I recommend the subbed version- Goku's screams are best heard in the original Japanese!",1064448000,4,552,5.076923076923077
1823649,4,B000083C4Z,"I'm one who likes to actually have a story in a movie.  Thus the 4 stars and not 5.  Even though this movie only has just enough story to justify the fighting, the fights are great.  The three Super Saiya-jin at this point in the overall DBZ story (Goku, Future Trunks, and Vegeta) with Gohan and Krillin (who stand on the side and watch for most of it) and Piccollo (eventually) face off against three nasty Androids (13, 14, and 15).  The fights continue to build right up to the very end and the final blow is rather impressive.
One thing about this movie (something that it shares with most of the other DBZ movies) is that if you've never seen the TV episodes that take place around the time that the movie is supposed to take place, you're going to be a bit lost.  Actually this is a problem for this movie especially, because I've read summaries of the series from the beginning through the end of the Cell Games, and apparently the point where this movie takes place is in the middle of multiple events, so I was a bit lost.  I didn't have this problem with the Cooler movies, because the story was pretty bland back then.
Anyways, back to the point.  The movie is quite good even though it's basically one huge fight, or maybe BECAUSE it's one huge fight.  Who knows.  But go get it if you're a DBZ fan.  If not, just watch it for the fights or go do a lot of research and THEN watch the movie.  Either way, pick it up and watch it.",1061510400,,1441,4.241758241758242

1823656,5,B000083C4Z,"I read a review below that stated basically stated the only good thing about this movie was the joke Vejita made at the end. True, the dub version is a little bland... but to be expected coming from FUNImation. However, even the english voices are getting better... just not the alterations the made about the script... including the joke by Vejita at the end. WHICH ISN'T THERE IN THE JAPANESE VERSION, THANK GOD. It completely ruined the silent effect of the scene between the two greatest conversationalists in DBZ... Vejita and Piccolo. *Sarcasm included*
The movie starts out with the characters doing every-day shopping in an every-day city. This is one of the reasons I enjoyed this movie. You catch a glimps of the characters in their normal lives when the biggest villian they have to fight are the lines at the checkout counter... something which rarely happens... and my favorite part of the movie. I'm a sucker for character behavior development, what can I say?
The fight scenes are decent... they get a little more graphic than the series does, especially with poor Vejita and Trunks. Once again, Krillin provides the comic relief and Piccolo saves Gohan's day while Vejita boasts about being the only one capable of defeating Kakarott. This is a common formula in the later movies, but I still enjoy it.
Bottom line: an awesome Japanese Dragon Ball Z movie... one of the top three. The english version? Well, it didn't help change my oppinion about FUNImation... but that was to be expected.",1051401600,5,1506,4.863813229571984
1823657,4,B000083C4Z,"Okay, so it's the worst of the movies/features so far but it's still worth the watch.  Of course, any true DBZ fan should buy it on the uncut format; anyone else might as well wait for Toonami or some other network to air it (they always do eventually).  If you can't wait I suggest finding it for rent.
It does have a few good fights though like most of the movies/features it is very anticlimactic.  It works off the idea that instead of Cell being Dr. Gero's ultimate android there are three other with the numbers 13, 14, and 15.  Only these androids were created by a computer that believes it I Dr. Gero.  Because Cell never came around Gohan never became a super saiyan and none of the fighters became ascended super saiyans.  So without these options when 13, 14, and 15 merge into one Super Android 13 Goku relies on an oldie but a goodie called the Spirit Bomb!  Anyway, this movie does have one other thing going for it, you see Vegeta tells a joke right at the end.

1823659,4,B000083C4Z,"The biggest problem with the movies are they are just not up to the story-telling quality of the series, but this one, while not near as good as the last Cooler movie, isn't too bad. It's pretty much an excuse for a major Super Saiyan fight-fest vs the popular android/cyborgs & there's no real reason for Krillin & Gohan tagging along other than to make all the fans happy all the major fighters are represented(Yamcha's a non-issue by now). It took waaaay too long for The Prince to arrive so we get nowhere near enough Saiyan Prince(the major reason I ever started watching Dragonball Z in the first place), but as in the last movie, he's very well used--totally within character--none of the goofy stuff we get with Krillin(ok, Krillin is comic relief). The English cast isn't bad except for the country bumpkin Android 13--didn't care much for the vocal choice--even grating. My daughter's comment was Android 13's English speech pattern is closer to Goku's original Japanese if one can trust the subtitles--Goku & Chi Chi both use ""ain't"" far more than any of the rest of the regulars. The humor is pretty good, particularly the very last one about the movie being over.
If one is not a fan of the show, this movie will probably just annoy, but DBZ fans will probably enjoy the show once it gets past the 10 minute ode to shopping comic relief intro. Fans of Teen Trunks should be very happy.",1045267200,,1398,4.641129032258065
