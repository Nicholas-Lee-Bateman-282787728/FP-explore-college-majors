3734182,3,B001OQCUZM,"Imagine a unique blend of A Christmas Carol and Hugh Hefner after eating way too much pizza with the works too late at night and his resulting nightmares and you have an idea of the plot line in Ghosts.

McConaughy plays his usual character -- confident, sarcastic, intense and charming. Garner plays the girl-next-door all grown up. If you are a fan of both or either, the movie may charm you. And charming it is with clever enough writing and characterization.

However, the sheer number of used and discarded females by both Connor (McConaughey) and his mentor Uncle Wayne (Douglas) is a bit overwhelming and sad. The advice and early life training by Uncle Wayne is horrifying but makes Connor's character sympathetic.

The language and adult themes and the multitudes of encounters make me hesitate to recommend it to anyone younger than seventeen and to warn anyone over that age to not expect movie Nirvana.",1243987200,2,914,4.883870967741935
3734183,5,B001OQCUZM,This movie had me laughing out loud at parts. In other parts I was muttering curses under my breath at Matthew's character for his views of women and love. He is the guy most girls love to hate and then in the end has them in tears for his drastic change of heart. It has easily become my favorite romantic comedy. It is a must see for any fan of this genre.,1243555200,3,358,3.986111111111111
3734184,3,B001OQCUZM,"So it has come to this, has it? Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" reinterpreted as a romantic comedy. I don't know--something about this doesn't sit well with me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that ""A Christmas Carol"" is a tale of spiritual and emotional redemption, in part about accepting Christmas as a holiday but more so about opening yourself up to love and happiness. ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" pretends to be those things, but at its core, it's really nothing more than a dime-a-dozen fable about how to get the girl. In all likelihood, this would have been acceptable had the filmmakers not opted for a modernized adaptation of Dickens' story. I've seen many romantic comedies, and since they all tell the exact same story, recommending them comes down which has the most style and the best overall structure. ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" falls short in both categories.

In this version of the story, money lender Ebenezer Scrooge is changed to photographer Conner Mead (Matthew McConaughey), and instead of the Christmas season, he finds fault with anything relating to love and lasting relationships. So strongly does he despise these concepts that he openly lambasts his brother, Paul (Breckin Meyer), who's only one day away from tying the knot with his high-strung fiance, Sandra (Lacey Chabert). After making everyone feel like a loser during the rehearsal dinner, Conner steps into the bathroom and has an encounter with the ghost of his uncle, Wayne (Michael Douglas), who spent his adult life going from one woman to the next without any regard for their feelings. Now that he's dead, he wants Conner to change his ways so as not to end up alone and miserable. With any luck, he'll finally come around and get back together with his childhood sweetheart, Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner), who Conner hurt many years ago.

Unlike Jacob Marley, Uncle Wayne is not shackled by a chain forged from his mortal acts of greed; the only prop we see him with is a glass of scotch (or bourbon, or whiskey, or whatever), which isn't the most convincing sign that his soul is trapped in purgatory.

Uncle Wayne tells Conner pretty much the exact same thing Jacob Marley says to Scrooge: ""You will be haunted by three Spirits. Without their visits, you cannot hope to shun the path I tread."" Here enters the Ghost of Girlfriends Past (Emma Stone), who takes Conner back in time to see what turned him into such a cold-hearted man. The strange thing is, this ""ghost"" technically isn't dead--she's like the ectoplasmic echo of a geeky sixteen-year-old girl named Allison Vandermeersh, who Conner had sex with when he was only a teenager back in the 1980s. Whatever happened to Allison over the years is something the film never bothers to address, but regardless, her ""ghost"" forces Conner to relive many experiences, none more important than the ones that included Jenny.

It isn't long before Conner meets the Ghost of Girlfriends Present, another manifestation of a woman who isn't actually dead. This time, it's Conner's assistant, Melanie (Noureen DeWulf)--they never actually dated, but as she tells him, she's the closest there is to a consistent woman in his life. Soon afterwards, he meets the Ghost of Girlfriends Yet to Come, who looks not like a personification of death but like a shrouded angel. She doesn't say a word, but she knows how to get a point across.

Intertwined with all this is a subplot involving a secret Paul has been keeping from Sandra, one that a trio of desperate man-seekers has found out about. This, naturally, plays a big part in Conner's rehabilitation, which is just as inevitable as Scrooge's epiphany in ""A Christmas Carol."" But the problem here has nothing to do with inevitability; Dickens' story is simply not suitable material for a romantic comedy. The ultimate message ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" sends is that, with just a few different moves, you'll end up winning the girl you were meant to win. I find this incredibly shallow, insensitive, and worst of all, unromantic. There's no point in adapting Dickens' story if the goal is to follow the classic formula of Boy Gets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl Back.

Some may argue that ""A Christmas Carol"" in and of itself has been adapted far too many times, and therefore its message is just as tired as the one in this film. That may be true, but at the very least, ""A Christmas Carol"" is repeatedly sending a good message; so good, in fact, that I believe we should continue to hear it (and we will with the November release of Robert Zemeckis' version of the story). ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,"" however, repeats a message that's both unrealistic and narrow-minded, and that doesn't do anything for anyone. Ultimately, I can think of no good reason for people to do and see this movie. I have a feeling that Charles Dickens would do much more than turn in his grave if they knew what was done with his story.",1243296000,,4936,4.82172373081464
3734185,5,B001OQCUZM,"I really enjoyed this movie and it is an EXCELLENT MOVIE that Finally Gives Love a Great Name but not until the end! Finally a movie to show just how fragile the heart of a individual can be when they are madly in love and just how easy it is for another individual to break it and walk away without thinking of the conseqences as they need to learn that the grass is never greener on the other side.  If they just take the time to water their own grass, then would see that its a much better yard that they left than the neighbors. It reflects how an individual can carry the pain from the past into the present that made their heart stone cold and continue to hurt others. It just goes to show you that you must face your past and deal with it before moving forward and maybe by dealing with the past, you can find a way to become a blessings to others by becoming tenderhearted and fight and go out of your way to make this world a better place to be in; To take risks and love another with the kind of love that awakens your soul and fires you up to make you a better person in the end.",1242518400,2,1090,4.023041474654378
3734186,2,B001OQCUZM,"Well, all right. All right

Actually, I wish I could say that about ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"", the newest Matthew McConnaughey film, yet another step on his self-administered road to obscurity. But I can't because this film gives the term ""Chick Flick"" a bad name.

Connor Mead (McConnaughey) is a world-famous photographer and world-famous bachelor.  He arrives at his studio and quickly flirts with and photographs a number of beautiful women, all of whom flirt back because his reputation apparently precedes him. He quickly snaps a shot of a new singer for the cover of ""Vanity Fair"" and then proceeds to seduce her in his office while breaking up with three other girls via a conference web cam set up by his faithful assistant Melanie (Noureen DeWulf). He quickly rushes off to his little brother's wedding at his Uncle Wayne's estate. Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas), a famous womanizer, has died, but he raised the two boys so Connor and Paul (Breckin Meyer) own the estate. When he arrives, Connor quickly runs into Jenny Perroti (Jennifer Garner), his old girlfriend, who warns him not to do anything to ruin the wedding of her sister, Sandra (Lacey Chabret, TV's ""Party of Five""). But Connor is an affirmed bachelor and can't understand why his little brother wants to tie the knot. Drinking madly, Connor is soon visited by the spirit of Uncle Wayne who tells him he will be visited by the ghosts of three former girlfriends who will hopefully help guide him through a journey of self-discovery. Connor runs away and finds himself back in bed with Allison (Emma Stone), the first girl he ever slept with, in his bed, complete with ""Material Girl"" outfit. She quickly takes Connor back to his early days and the film works forward from there.

Actually, the film works forward from there, plodding along at a snail's pace.

There is a lot wrong with ""Ghosts"" and little right, which is a bit of a shock because the film is helmed by Mark Waters, the man who brought us the surprising ""Mean Girls"". ""Ghosts"" never achieves the right tone or consistency, giving us more drama than comedy, less madcap than plodding and stilted direction.

Matthew McConnaughey continues to skips his way through a series of forgettable films, rom-com's that are either badly directed, badly written or both. And McConnaughey is not a very good actor in the best of his films, so when he doesn't have a good director, good screenplay or good co-stars, the result is bad.  In ""Ghosts"", he plays an even more obnoxious version of his stock character, the horn dog. Connor Mead is the horn dog to end all horn dogs (here's hoping McConnaughey tries something different in his next film) and is so bad that he detests the very idea of marriage. As soon as he arrives at the wedding of his younger brother, he begins to bad mouth the institution and everything it stands for. This is mildly amusing, but his diatribe continues. And continues. And continues.

Then, he begins to hit on everyone. All but one of the bridesmaids have slept with Connor and he locks his sights on Jenny. But she has been burned by him before and will have nothing to do with him. I don't blame her because he acts like a Class A jerk from the moment he steps foot in his Uncle Wayne's estate.

It is mildly interesting to watch McConnaughey play a womanizing bachelor for a few minutes; he is quite good at it, but the idea wears thin. Connor has no redeeming qualities. None. Zero. Zilch. Which is probably why his Uncle Wayne pays him a visit. But this signals the point when the film becomes an odd hybrid, and not in a good way.

""Ghosts"" just isn't that funny. As soon as the whole 'visited by three ghosts' idea gets worked into the story, it becomes much more serious than I would have ever anticipated. It is almost like a morality play. ""I don't want this to happen to you, kid"" is Uncle Wayne's reason for visiting his nephew. So from that point forward, McConnaughey struggles through every scene trying to look earnest and repentant.

Jennifer Garner is a likable screen personality but in ""Ghosts"", she is never funny and only romantic for a few moments. She seems to have been given the instruction that she is appearing in a romantic drama. She confronts Connor on a few occasions, threatening him to avoid doing anything that might ruin her sister's wedding. In flashbacks, we see a few moments in their relationship and these are played remarkably straight and lifeless.

Breckin Meyer and Lacey Chabret play the newlyweds and they seem to have been given the same instructions because they never do anything but act incredibly serious. Lacey Chabret goes a step further to make her bride seem shrill and irritating. She must take her inspiration from a recently viewed DVD of ""Bride Wars"".

Emma Stone appears as though she might be able to provide us with some laughs. She plays Allison, the first girl Connor ever had sex with. Initially, she seems madcap and high strung and unusual. Then, we witness the first time they have sex, and it is amusing only because it has happened to so many of us in the same way, but after this, she merely stands by the sidelines watching as Connor tries to deal with all of the images flooding his mind.

The one bright spot for a few laughs falls on Michael Douglas. Douglas appears to be channeling Robert Evans, the once prolific producer who ran Paramount Studios in the early 70s, when they were producing films like ""The Godfather"" and ""Marathon Man"". Evans has a reputation as a ladies man and Douglas channels the man's persona, style and mannerisms and borrows many of his trademark physical attributes. Uncle Wayne takes his two nephews in when their parents are killed (I know, I know, the stuff from which every great comedy is wrought). When Connor becomes a teenager, Wayne decides his nephew needs some help and begins to coach him, teaching him his unique, effective ways of scoring woman. Douglas has fun with the role and occasionally says something mildly outrageous eliciting a laugh from the audience. But it isn't enough to save the film.

When you see the trailer for a film like ""Ghosts"", you expect it to be certain things, funny, romantic, madcap. Many people would probably expect it to be a 'chick flick'. I can't stand labels like this because it sort of presupposes men aren't interested in romantic films, comedy or drama or films with strong female leads. For those of you who are out there laughing right now, really? You aren't ever interested in a romantic comedy? That's too bad. May you be doomed to a lifetime of Vin Diesel action films. Even if you never see a romantic comedy, too often the label 'chick flick' is applied to terrible films like ""Bride Wars"" or any other recent film starring Kate Hudson. But when even a film like ""Ghosts"" doesn't fulfill any of these needs, to laugh, to cry, to hear your heart beat, it gives this derogatory term a bad name.

I got the impression ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" would be much more madcap and it is, in fact, much more dour. Because you keep waiting for laughs, keep waiting for something funny to happen, ""Ghosts"" becomes a long, tedious film.",1242086400,,7154,4.702076677316294

3734188,5,B001OQCUZM,"Just saw this one in the theater and it was a great flick with a lot of laughs. I thoroughly enjoyed it!

In a take-off of the Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol, the ghosts of past girlfriends and other voluntary spirits, attempt to help a cold-hearted womanizer bring back the sensitivity and love in his life.

We begin the plot with the much sought-after bachelor ladies' man, in-demand schmoozer, professional photographer Conner (McConahey).  He loves all the ladies, every one he can get into, so to speak.  As we watch love 'em and leave 'em Conner break the ladies' hearts, we begin to think of him as a loveable schmuck.  Even though we want to slap him, there is something about him.  We follow him to his brother's wedding at the country home he grew up, in a castle-sized estate. We find out that his parents died young, leaving 7 year old Conner to help raise his 2 year old brother.  Both were raised by Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas) at the mansion.

Young Conner grew up with young Jennie (Jennifer Garner).  They seemed to be best friends but fell short on the boyfriend/girlfriend end of the stick when they got into their teens.  Conner seemed afraid of being hurt and, under the expert tutilage of Uncle Wayne, turned into a ladies man.

Showing up at the wedding and voicing his extreme cynicism about love and marriage, Conner offends everyone.  He is soon visited by the now deceased Uncle Wayne who tells him to mend his evil ways.  To help Conner out, Wayne warns him of upcoming visits from 3 spirits, just like Jacob Marley and Ebineezer Scrooge.

And so it begins.  As I said, it is often laugh-out-loud funny, coupled with sincerety and love.  There were times I found a tear or two in my eyes.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would certainly want to see it again.  It's a feel-good movie and enjoyable to watch the sincerity and love return to this man's life.",1241395200,44,1892,4.597014925373134
3734189,2,B001OQCUZM,"Went to see this on a recent date night and was very disappointed.  The trailers seem to make one think this is a chick flick but in reality it is ""Seth Rogen"" light.  Most the comedy was basic bathroom humor.  Matthew McConaughey phones in a performance as sleazebucket Conner Mead.  You've seen him play the same role over and over in movie after movie.  Michael Douglas is wasted in a role that seems to be Channeling Jerry Lewis as Buddy Love(Anne Archer and Douglas are together again in this movie 20 years after starring as the Husband and Wife in ""Fatal Attraction"").

Jennifer Garner as the Love interest who doesn't fall for his act after being dumped by him once is really good as is Lacey Chabert all grown up as Conner's Sister in Law to be, a worried Bridezilla.  The best roles are taken by two of the ""Ghosts"".  Emma Stone is great as the Ghost of Girlfriends past, Conner's first conquest in High School in the 80's.  Noureen DeWulf is great as the Ghost of Girlfriends Present Conner's set upon assistant Melanie who though not actually dating him is the closest thing he has in his life to a stable relationship.

There may have been one or two laugh out loud funny parts in the movie but they were way two infrequent to justify the $20 admission during a Recession.",1241395200,2,1285,4.5
3734190,3,B001OQCUZM,"Connor Mead (McConaughey) hasn't quite been the same since the junior high dance.  Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner) stood right in front of him while Foreigner played and he clutched and didn't 'take the big chance' on asking her to dance.

He ran to Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas) for advice on woman.  The self-proclaimed inventor of the word MILF and seat-beltless driver of the STBN WGN advised his nephew exactly how to close the deal with women and Connor's been doing fine with the ladies ever since.

Until he meets Jenny at his little brother Pete's wedding. Bridesmaid Jenny advises him: ""You mess this up, I'll come to your bedroom at midnight and cut off your favorite appendage.""

Connor liked the first part, but not the second...Still, he despises the union of marriage.  After all, according to him and his funky Uncle, ""the strongest part of any relationship is the one who loves the least.""

But, deceased Uncle Wayne comes to him--in the mensroom, no less, and advises him he's going to meet three ghosts this night--the ghosts of girlfriends past, present, and future and they're going to help him change his ways.

Predictable, yes.  Funny, definitely.  If you want some good raunchy laughs and enjoy a randy homage without the 'seasonal schmaltz' ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" is definitely worth a rainy afternoon in the theatre.

3734191,3,B001OQCUZM,"It's a cleverly comedic twist on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and surprisingly entertaining even though it's obviously a vehicle for Matthew McConaughey to make female audiences swoon. It's also the perfect movie to open against X-Men Origins: Wolverine - anyone not interested in the action-packed mutant extravaganza will surely take comfort in the harmlessly pleasant romantic humor of this simple tale of moral redemption.

Fashion photographer Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) is a typical ladies' man and playboy - the kind of jerk who breaks up with three women simultaneously via a computer conference call. And yet the girls love him, clamoring to be the next one-night-stand. He's invited by his brother Paul (Breckin Meyer) to Paul and Sandra's (Lacey Chabert) wedding, against the advice of Connor's childhood sweetheart Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner) and everyone familiar with his scandalous ways. She once had hopes for him, but Connor didn't want his meaningless but exciting short-lived sexual relationships to be hindered by feelings. He's like the Tin Man - born without a heart.

Mead owes his attitude primarily to his mentor Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas), a now deceased lady-killer legend who notoriously hosted mind-numbing, clothing optional, week-long orgies in his house - he also invented the word ""MILF."" Through the careful tutoring of Wayne, Connor has grown up to believe love is a magical comfort food for the weak and uneducated - forever condemning a fruitful relationship with Jenny. But his theories on love are destined to change when the ghost of Uncle Wayne returns to warn him of his wicked ways, along with visits by the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, Present and Future.

The conclusion may be terribly contrived, and the plot completely predictable in its unwavering course of correcting a tarnished soul and building Connor to be contemptible in his efforts to paint love as a corrupt and hateful institution (he mean-spiritedly claims that the power of a relationship lies within whoever cares less), but the film isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. At times it's almost self-aware that it's a movie, taking themes less than seriously, and several of the purely comedic performances, including Emma Stone as the Ghost of Girlfriends Past and Douglas as womanizer Wayne, are hilariously delightful. It may be a Matthew McConaughey movie, but it's a little more open to general audiences than his usual women-only mindless mush.

3734379,4,B001OQCUZM,"A flock of Hollywood pros set out to make a light, entertaining romantic comedy for the Friday night at the movies crowd but ended up with better than they knew.  Mark Waters directed from a script by the writing tag team, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore.  Lucas and Moore often work in tandem as they did with their scripts for the well done 'Four Christmases' and the over the top but very popular 'Hangover' series.  Director Waters has had success with films like 'Mean Girls' and 'Freaky Friday (2003)'.  They know how to put things on screen that we will watch.
  But this light weight effort comes well above the rest of the genre because of the stellar work by the principals and the back up crew as well.  Matthew McConaughey shows the skills that will go on to make him into one of the top dramatic actors working today.  He plays a cad, a womanizer who has such care to protect his own heart that he has no care for the hearts of the women he encounters.  The many many women that he encounters.  We believe him capable both of the seduction and the abandonment of the women.  This is also a very good role and a very good effort for co-star Jennifer Garner, an actress I do not ordinarily take to.  This should rank as among her very best stints on screen.  She is smooth, controlled and on point at all times.
  I confess to a soft spot for the incomparable Emma Stone, only 21 here but playing a 16 year old ghost, the McConaughey character's first sexual encounter.  Even then, even in a supporting role, she is wonderful, funny, mobile featured, cute and tough, an excellent ghost to give a lesson to the sexual predator a'la 'A Christmas Carol', which story is adapted here to school not a miser but a rogue.  Also good is Brecklin Meyer' ('Clueless', '54')/  The writers gift him with a touching speech and he makes the most of it.  He should have a more prominent career, in my opinion.  Michael Douglas channels Dean Martin in his role as the uncle and foster father that taught McConaughey how to avoid emotional attachment.
  All in all, a rather silly, rather charming movie comes to life through the exceptional work of gifted actors. Who would have guessed?",1467244800,,2176,4.497448979591836

But to get to that end, this movie takes the viewer on a fun journey of ghosts, middle school and brotherly affection. Unlike a lot of rom-com's, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past follows mostly the male lead. So it's Matthew McConaughey's movie, and that's alright, alright, alright if you like him as an actor. You'll see a lot of him in this movie; he is in almost every scene. The Jennifer Garner character is really there to witness and legitimize his transformation from cad to committed.

The scenes w/his ""girlfriends past"" are awkward and painful - you don't even get that little revenge/payback thrill from seeing an ex-girlfriend tell the jerk who broke her heart who he really is, because you wonder why any woman would 1) fall for him in the first place, or 2) bother wasting her breathe on telling off a guy who's such an obvious @**hole.

3734670,4,B001OQCUZM,"Who'd have thought that Charles Dickens's classic Christmas story could be retooled to apply to a playboy dealing with his own demons?  I certainly didn't, but the filmmakers involved in this project made it work.  While it can't be called the ""comedy of the year"", this film was still pretty funny, well-acted, and told a worth-while story, even if there were a fair number of corny moments.  My favorites in the film were Michael Douglas as our lead's, played by Matthew McConaughey, deceased uncle and Emma Stone as the ghost of his first physical partner...I would have liked to know whether that girl was actually dead or a convenient form that the spirit took.  The original story made it inescapably clear that those were all ghosts.  Here, it's a bit confusing as the second ghost is the lead's very-much-alive assistant at work.  But from that star-costing flaw and the earlier touched-on corny moments, this was a pretty good film.  You could see chemistry between the leads, though more as adults than children.  It's an above-average romantic comedy that anyone can view with a loved one.  Enjoy.",1403654400,,1108,4.913978494623656

Deep down he's always loved her, but he was wounded and unfathered in his past so when he finally gets to reconnect with his childhood sweetheart and makes it to her bed,  he can't handle her love and he runs.  She's always pined away for him and years later when they meet up again at his brother's wedding, she calls him on his crap and he turns over a new leaf---all for her---all after seeing the light through the ghosts of girlfriends past.

3734824,1,B001OQCUZM,"For a rom-com chick flick, this wasn't awful.  That is not saying much.

The theme of this movie is a rough approximation of A Christmas Carol.  We get to take a walk down relationship memory lane, witness a turbulent relationship present, and bump up against a potential relationship future that is also less than stellar.  Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner are the foils.  I do not hold either in great esteem, but McConaughey was not bad in The Lincoln Lawyer.  That said, this is typical pretty boy-acting-badly-then-mending-his-ways-to-get-the-girl fodder that can get tiresome and repetitive.  Given that McConaughey plays these roles 9 times out of 10 and that the premise for the plot draws heavily from a famous Dickens work that everyone knows by heart, I could see where Ghosts of Girlfriends Past was going about five minutes in.

For all that an actor like George Clooney or Leonardo DiCaprio has to offer by way of charm, charisma, and good guy appeal, Matthew McConaughey seems to be a poster child for a substantial deficit of these traits.  He exudes cockiness, overconfidence, and selfishness.  Hence, he gets typecast into a lot of roles like this one, where his past bad behavior as a significant other (or, due to the brevity of the relationships, a less-than-significant other) is put on display and exploited for its comic effect.  This go-round, McConaughey is an apparently famous photographer, wealthy, desired by desirable women, and not looking to settle down.  He even breaks up with three women by telephone conference.  If that isn't predictable Matt McConaughey bad boy behavior, I don't know what is.  Needless to say, predictable.

Oh yeah, and beautiful women throw themselves at this guy.  They line up to hook up.  Again, predictable.  Looks over character always prevails in this universe.

And there has to be a wedding where things go wrong.  What a handy little device to rekindle old flames, hint at possible new burns, and pile on artificial drama and conflict.  Ho hum.

There were some moderately redeeming qualities in the performances.  Jennifer Garner is a believable Girl Next Door, the One That Got Away.  She's not too pretty, not too sexy, not too smart, not too clever, but a best friend that could turn into more.  That role suits her.

Michael Douglas's suave and macho uncle is something he can pull off.  The hubris he ultimately represents was a nice touch to the end of this picture.  His character otherwise set up some minor laughs that otherwise would have made for a pretty dud-filled outing.

I would avoid this movie if you are looking for something refreshing and different in romantic comedy.  If you want a well-worn, old, warm, and comfortable blanket of a standard chick flick, this is right on the money.",1361491200,,2781,4.956709956709957

3734863,5,B001OQCUZM,"It has a taut script and a biting wit, which will keep you laughing like the dickens for all 100 minutes. It is an ""adaptation"" of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol""--sort of.

Matthew McConaughey is the real Scrooge in one Connor Mead, a handsome, successful, photographer whose only greed is lust. Love'em and leave'em is the code that he lives by, going so far as to break up with three women by conference call so he can save time. But things are about to change for Connor when he meets his dead Uncle Wayne the night before his brother's wedding. His uncle, played by Michael Douglas taught him all he needed to know about using charms on the fairer sex (Bob Marley). Now he warns his nephew that it was a wasted life, and that he will be met that evening by three ghosts of girlfriend's past.

Between the ""past,"" ""present,"" and ""future"" dreams he manages to antagonize most of the guests, insult the bride, shame his brother the groom, and disrupt everything from the cake to the wedding. After the ghost of girlfriend future appears, we find out if there is a future for Connor or a redeemed Connor. (Hey, you there, boy! Is it Christmas? No, it's Saturday, you moron)!

There were many quotes in the script that were punchy and witty. They came as quick as a Neil Simon play. The scene with the wedding cake was hilarious as was the photography shoot at the beginning. Noureen DeWulf, who played his secretary and the ghost of Girlfriend Present nearly stole the show for me with her Indian accent and her great lines such as: ""There's apple, bubble gum and Tandoori [martinis]. I know it sounds gross, but have two of them and you won't feel your face,"" and ""Don't be sad, you whiny b****es."" The rest of the supporting cast blend in nicely and add their barbs with perfect timing to this spunky script.

This is all-year-round fare, not Christmas, but I suppose it wouldn't be bad as the second part of double feature after ""Christmas Carol"" with Allistair Simms.

3734894,1,B001OQCUZM,"Why do women always go for the ""bad boys""?
The character ""Connor"" in this film is a clear,no committment,serial womaniser, and yet has no trouble bedding women on his own terms. And this is not just a hollywood fantasy,as there are too many examples of this in real life. Even the gorgeous Sandra Bullock, who is not stupid, married a complete ass in real life, and then was humiliated completely as the stories of his infidelity and prediliction for tattoed strippers and pornstars came to light.
In this film, we have Connor enjoying relationships with women on his own terms.
But, before we think too badly of him, we must not forget what caused him to behave this way. He used to be a nice boy,shy, well behaved and respectful of women.
But, at the school dance, his girl breaks his heart and humiliates him by going off to dance with an older ""bad boy"" teen with whom she publicly shares her first kiss.
Destroyed, Connor resolves never to be put into that situation again. And his uncle shows him how. And the girl who did this to him is none other than the Jennifer Garner character who now looks down on him from her snooty heights because of his behaviour. Funny how she forgot about her behaviour that put him onto this path in the first place.
But, ladies, it was you who made him like this in the first place.",1327881600,,1321,4.462809917355372
3734895,2,B001OQCUZM,"Are you looking for another version of ""A Christmas Carol""?  You know, that movie with that Scrooge dude?  Look no further (unless you want to see a good movie).  Matthew McConaughey plays the Scrooge character in this movie.  But...wait a minute...didn't Scrooge suck in a ""drop dead you vile human being"" sort of way?  MM, the horror (or should I say whore) of the movie is vile because he sexes women.  A lot of women.  Unapologetically.  And while the women don't like the fact that he loves them and leaves them, well, they like his ""fact"" enough to want to let him continue to love them even if he will leave them.  He's rich, good looking, and smiles a lot.  And has a lot of sex.  And apparently any woman is up for grabs as long as he thinks that she is not gay or currently married.  MM, we're to believe, is a really unhappy individual because he doesn't believe in ""true love"" of the marriage variety.  But the movie doesn't make him unlikable (and it doesn't want to).  It doesn't make him a true Scrooge.  Sure, he finds his ""true love"" by the end of the movie and is a changed man.  So what?  He's sexed up half of America and Europe at this point and because he's now off the market the ladies (in the wedding party) are going to have to look for their good lay with the geek squad.  The redemption of the Scrooge character is flat and far off and there are a lot of other characters that need a lot of redeeming themselves.

This movie makes everyone in it look like a piece of crap (even the bride's mother who #1 doesn't take the slightest offense at MM grabbing and fondling her breasts at the wedding rehearsal--wish I could get away with that!--and #2 in blithely discussing everyone's sexual adventures with each other refers to the potential of having sex with MM as a ""I could have worse"" scenario).  This is supposed to be a romantic comedy?  It's insulting is what it is.

3734897,2,B001OQCUZM,"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past was completely panned when it came out, so I avoided it in the theatres. I caught it on HBO recently, and I must say, I didn't think all the vitriol was well-deserved. It's cast well, and though the basic premise is a bit cringe-worthy, I thought it was executed smoothly.

Here's the skinny: Connor Mead (Matt McConaughey) is an insecure teenager who finds the girl that he loves kissing another boy at a school dance. Humiliated, he vents his frustration to his Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas). The consummate ladies' man, Uncle Wayne steps in and teaches Connor all the tricks he needs to get what he wants out of women - without ever getting too close. The vestiges of these lessons keep Connor from ever truly connecting to Jenny (Jennifer Garner), the true love of his life.

Years later, when Connor's little brother, Paul (Breckin Meyer), is getting married, Connor travels to the wedding only to be haunted by ghosts of his past girlfriends, who vow to change him for the better.

I thought performances were solid. Though the storyline is trite, the actors did a good job with it. I also thought there was good chemistry between Garner and McConaughey, and Michael Douglas' oily Uncle Wayne gave me some gleeful moments.

Fans of William Goldman know his mantra about how a bad film can result from a good script, but McConaughey films are starting to show that a terrible script can be made into an unwatchable mess if enough miscast people are thrown in.

Hollywood obviously loves Dickens since (1) he's classic, (2) he's dead, and (3) his copyright is sitting in his urn, so is prime for stealing - sorry, I mean 're-imagining'. The original story of redemption, lost love and transformation is kicked square in the unspeakables here with a pitch that must have sounded like: ""A like totally hot fashion photographer with all these superhot babes is asked to his ugly brother's wedding and he screws it up like pooch-style but then it's like the Scrooge thing. You know, Scrooge? It just totally writes itself.""

Wow, where to start. Well, everyone knows about the Christmas Carol concept and how it's been ripped off over the years usually to good effect - a combination of the Muppets Christmas Carol and Scrooged should be enough to get anyone into the festive spirit. The interesting part about GoGP is that it highlights some key parts of the story that must stay intact for the whole thing to work (Dickens would love this):

1. Whoever the Scrooge replacement is must be redeemable, plausible and likeable to a degree. Bill Murray pulls this off with Frank Cross (""You're a hallucination brought on by Russian vodka poisoned by Chernobyl!""). McConaughey is squirmingly bad for both men and women to watch. This is essential since the character transformation in the timespan of a movie isn't realistic.

2. The ghosts must actually be dead and not previously connected with Scrooge, since they're essentially narrating for the audience. Having ghosts that are partly dead but also alive (yes, they did) undermines the external nature of the way they work in the plot. GoGP had a first girlfriend who may have killed herself as a teenager, a second who was his current secretary (never girlfriend) and third - the future ghost - as someone he never dates. This doesn't work.

3. The pacing of Dickens' story is essential - too much frontloading makes the backend seem unlikely and not enough setup doesn't give us the opportunity to care. This film manages to make both mistakes at the same time, and I still can't figure out how.

There are a many other problems with the movie. Scrooge is a fashion photographer who takes world class pictures without looking through a viewfinder, using a basic Nikon SLR (with the lens that came in the Costco package, interestingly enough). Michael Douglas doesn't work here either. And as for the rush in Act 3 to make everything right again, it feels so forced that it's like the editor was replaced with the automated-mode of Muvee Magic. Avoid!",1284336000,2,2922,4.822355289421158

He shows up at his brother engagement dinner in order to deliberately wreck it.  He offers to help his bro leave his bride at the altar, ruins the cake, and during the dinner toast, launches into a rant about marriage is a tyrannical institution and is as childish as the ""eeester bunneh"".

The ghosts don't even show up until the 30 min mark, and the title is a misnomer:  actually, only the first ghost is an ex-girlfriend.  The Jacob Marley of the movie is ""Uncle Wayne"" (Michael Douglas) a boozy ladies' man ghost who chastises Matt for being a bum.  This despite overlong flashbacks showing Wayne molding Matt into the bum he is today.  Uncle Wayne invented the term ""MILF"", or so the movie says. American Pie was not that long ago, morons.

Robert Forrester is in here, for some reason. Is he physically incapable of cracking a smile?

His love em' and leave em' attitude is well known in the circle he travels and is actually one of the quirks that draw women to him. For Conner, life just can't get any better. When he's invited to attend his brother's wedding, he heads out with one resolve: to talk him out of making the biggest mistake of his life. What Conner doesn't know is that he's about to take a trip through hell and the choices he makes this weekend will determine just how good life could be.

After seeing his childhood sweetheart, Jenny, Conner is forced to take a trip down memory lane in a Christmas Carol-type adventure. He's confronted with girlfriends from his past, present and future, and is left after each trip to ponder life without Jenny in it. With the end of the weekend fast approaching, his window of opportunity is starting to close. Will Conner make the right decision? Or will his skewed view on life end up ruining not only his future, but his brother's as well?

I love anything ""Christmas Carol."" It's rare for me to find a Christmas Carol-type show that I haven't seen, but each year I look for them. I was thrilled when someone told me about Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. As soon as I realized it stared Matthew McConaughey (oh my!), I knew it would be a keeper. McConaughey and Garner were perfect in their roles. Even though I knew how it had to end, the writers did a great job of giving this story a unique feel. If you are looking for a fun, sexy story where the hero gets exactly what he deserves (you'll have to watch it to see what I mean), then Ghosts of Girlfriends Past is one you'll want to see. I LOVED it!

3734985,5,B001OQCUZM,"Yes yes, I KNOW.  I'm a guy.  I'm not supposed to like romantic comedies.  Most of the time I DON'T like them.  In fact on my profile page I even state how much I dislike them.  But... every so often one comes along and forces me to lighten up.  There, that's my excuse for enjoying Ghosts of Girlfriends Past!

Oh man, the main character in this film is someone who treats women like gold until he gets to sleep with them... and then in the middle of the night, he takes off running!  Leaving the woman alone, hurt, and confused.  What a horrible, dirty dirtbag!

Anyway, in the story, three separate ghosts come to visit this horrible man and try to show him the damage that his wreckless and irresponsible ways have caused these women in the past, present, and future.

A good chunk of storytelling for each of the three ghosts takes place (especially the past ghost) and all of them are very funny and highly entertaining.  The man character, portrayed by Matthew McConaughey (who by the way, somewhat resembles a younger looking Bruce Springsteen, in my opinion) is definitely a good one.

What you definitely need to do however, is completely disregard the first 20 minutes of film, which were pretty boring and pointless.  The film picks up after that point, and that's when you should start really paying attention.

It should also be noted that the film ventures into whacky and zanny territory several times (such as during a certain wedding cake scene) and that's honestly not a bad thing at all because it keeps the storytelling strong all the way to the finish line.

A funny comedy that guys shouldn't be ashamed to admit they liked (YOU know who you are, hehe)!  After the film is over, you guys should be walking straight up to your girlfriend and going ""Hey honey, *that* was a classic comedy!""",1269043200,,1811,4.609375

It's one giant cliche, really obvious plot lines, and for no point.

The screen play takes the Christmas Dickens classic with the miser Scrooge
and turns the miser into a playboy. When young people need
positive examples that are easy to understand, this movie delivers.
Casual sex is a topic here and the life of the philandering hero
starts to go really down hill when his brother throws him out of
his wedding party after he lets slip about who the brother had slept with.
And ruined the wedding cake as well...
The uncle who had raised him comes back as a ghost and
leads him through getting in contact with his better but forgooten side
using three ghosts of girlfriends.
That there is an happy ending helps. Jennifer Garner
may be more convincing as an action spy hero,

I'm guessing the title was borrowed from a phrase by Hugh Grant in Four Weddings And A Funeral, where he literally mentions 'Ghosts of girlfriends past...'

Michael Douglas almost stole the show with his role as the rascally Uncle Wayne, although, (no disrespect to Michael) I disagree with including a reference to a memorable night involving himself and Steve McQueen and a bunch of air hostesses (that part was fine) and 'a pile of blow the size of a toaster'... After which Matt's character says, 'It sounded like a great night...' No, drugs can never be part of a great night, and I think it's a mistake to include that part of the scene... sorry...

Matthew McConaughey, can be seen in a string of run of the mill formula romance comedies.  On the surface this looks like another lightweight comedy under his belt.

Here Matthew McConaughey who plays a bachelor, Connor Mead, dedicated to his craft, as his brother(Breckin Meyer) is about to commit the unthinkable ""marriage"".  When he gets there he is confronted by his ghost of his long dead Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas who pretty much plays himself). In the tradition of ""A Christmas Carol"" he will meet three ghosts of girlfriends or potential girlfriends. They will try to show where he went wrong in life. Will he fall for this? Jennifer Garner plays his on-again off again lifelong love. Will she fall for the supposedly reformed Connor?

It is the one liner's and the tasty wedding treats that will keep you involved.

3735113,1,B001OQCUZM,"Disappointing movie for both husband and myself.  Few funny spots, a lot of long boring dialogue. I bought the movie based on others with Matthew McConaughey which I truly loved - ""Fairlure to Launch"", ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"", ""Fools Gold"" and ""Sahara"".  Stick with the others and avoid this - unless you're just renting, because it isn't worth a second viewing.",1253923200,,369,4.661538461538462
3735134,5,B001OQCUZM,I would agee with the classification of this as more of a malefantasy movie than your classic romantic comdey; it is a bit racy at times. But with its cast of big names-from McConnaughey and Garner to Anee Archer and Michael Douglas-it is what is sets out to be-good entertainment. Iw ould not take young children to see it but my teenagers were suitably amused.,1253664000,9,362,4.584615384615384
3735135,2,B001OQCUZM,"I really wanted to love this movie.  The idea and cast give it the potential to be a hilarious romantic comedy, but sadly, it isn't.
I love Matthew McConaughey in pretty much everything he's ever been in.  He's a good actor, but I really didn't buy him as a charmer in this movie.  I really couldn't see why the women were falling for him.  He wasn't even slightly charming or likable.  He was just a jerk.  It made me feel like the writers of this movie thought all women were just idiots ready to fall into bed with anyone.
Jennifer Garner is another of my faves in other movies.  She wasn't bad in this one, but it wasn't enough to save the movie.

One thing I did like about this movie was Lacey Chabert.  She was very believable as the nervous bride to be.  She was freaking out about every detail as many brides do and was a wreck.  She gave us some comedic moments and was cute as a button.

I'm glad I only rented this movie from Netflix, so I'm only out an hour adn 40 minutes of my life rather than $20.  If you really feel the need to see this movie, rent it before buying it.",1253664000,38,1087,4.119047619047619
3735136,2,B001OQCUZM,"Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) is living every man's dream.  He has made a career out of photographing scantily clad women.  But that's nothing compared to the string of women he's left behind him.  No woman seems to be able to resist his charm, but once he's slept with them, he moves on.  Heck, he is able to break up with three women at once on a conference chat while still getting the one in his room to sleep with him.

All that changes the weekend of his brother Paul's (Breckin Meyer) wedding.  Connor is the best man, so he returns to his uncle Wayne's estate where he is reunited with his first crush Jenny (Jennifer Garner).  But as he is putting his moves on everyone around him, he starts seeing ghosts.  First, it's Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas), who warns him about three more to come.  Will Connor learn anything from these visits?

Quite obviously, this is the romantic comedy version of A Christmas Carol, a personal favorite of mine.  Between that, Jennifer Garner, and the fun previews, I thought this might actually be fun.  And it had a few fun moments.  I laughed a few times.  And I appreciated how the story was advanced with Connor interacting with the real people at the wedding in between the ghostly visits.

The acting, on the other hand, could have been better.  Even Jennifer Garner wasn't up to her normal standards.  The only one I really liked was Michael Douglas.  The ghostly special effects, on the other hand, were great.

My problem with this movie lies squarely on the shoulders of the writers.  It was written by two guys.  Instead of being a romantic comedy where Connor learns an important lesson, this is really a guy's fantasy flick.  Heck, we get a long flashback scene were Uncle Wayne is teaching a teenaged Connor how to score with women.  It adds nothing to the story or the characters.  It is only there because the authors found it fun.

Then there's the bride to be.  Yes, they were playing the overstressed bride for laughs, but she was such a despised characters, I was actually agreeing with Connor that his brother shouldn't marry the woman.

All this really shows itself in the climax.  Yes, we get the expected moral (the ending is hardly a surprise), but it happens so fast, I don't believe that Connor has actually learned anything.

My love of A Christmas Carol makes me look on this film more favorably then I should.  Don't be fooled by the previews, this is not a romantic comedy.  It is nothing but a male fantasy that pretends to be something else.  It isn't worth your time or money.",1253577600,8,2555,4.584070796460177
3735137,4,B001OQCUZM,"Plenty to read here from those that way over-analyzed what this film has to offer, but I think everyone knows what to expect from another golden-boy piece, the only question would be how the BD fares.

New Line is usually known for using quality film and cameras so the transfer turned out competent. There are plenty of colors, whites from the snow, a plethora of dark indoor shots and some green screen work to showcase your display while still keeping the ladies happy with content. The sound is TrueHD and gets used mostly with the awesome soundtrack (and maybe the car chase through the woods). The supplements give this 3-star film a four, including:
* 8:22 minutes of behind the scenes, generic interviews laced with film footage.
* 4:10 minutes of ""It's All About Connor"" - essentially how great it is to work with McConaughey
* 8:00 minutes of Legends/Ladies - a summary of having Michael Douglass on the set, most interesting bit was about his driving skills.
* 9:30 minutes of additional scenes. Glad they were cut; had even shallower dialogue than what we heard in the movie with the ladies. Though there were some extra little bits during Douglas' bar scene with the kid that were good.

The romcoms never do as well on Blu but if guys are looking to suffer through one, yet still see some hidef clarity - this won't kill the night. Be sure to listen/wake up during the Michael Douglas scenes as they are all hilarious. Enjoy.",1253404800,,1439,4.661417322834645
3735138,1,B001OQCUZM,"I watched this mediocre movie while on an 8 hour flight to central Europe.  I had a choice:  I could either watch Ghosts of Girlfriends Past or I could watch Relaxing Themes from Nature - two hours of grass blowing in the wind.  Boy do I wish I chose the latter instead of the former.

This movie can be summed up in one word: Suckatious.

Basically it is centered on the wedding of an affable guy, Paul and his bride to be Sandra (the youngest child from that uplifting show Party of Five, the show where all the parents have died and the kids have tragically screwed up lives...).  Connor Mead is Paul's chauvinistic older brother who sleeps with every woman shown on screen.  In fact, I think he somehow managed to sleep with the woman watching the movie next to me, as she could not stop crooning over Connor (Matthew McConaughey).

Connor goes to the bathroom and runs into long dead Michael Douglas, who plays his Uncle Wayne.  The CGI they use to bring Michael Douglas back to life isn't very convincing and, as a matter of fact, I'm not sure why they chose to make him look wooden.  ""Wayne"" tells Connor that he's going to be visited by three ghosts in an effort to make him realize the joy of a loving marriage.  After that Connor is visited by a dead chick, a living chick (???) and an angel.  Not three ghosts.

From there we see how shallow and vapid Connor is and why he should be detested.  I guess the little relationship vignettes were supposed to be funny - they weren't.  Jennifer Garner almost redeems the movie when she shows interest in dating a good looking lawyer with a heart of gold.  For a moment it looks like she's over Connor and is on her way to meeting Mr. Right.  Ah, but then the movie shifts gears, Connor ruins his brother's wedding day and temporarily breaks up Paul and Sandra in a strange series of mishaps.

Jenny (Garner) sees all of this and still gets weak in the knees for Connor.  During the climax Connor gives some sort of redeeming speech to Sandra and Jenny realizes that she still loves Connor.  Huh?  Yeah, his whole slime ball shtick is that he can talk his way into a woman's pants, and bingo, he finally wins Jenny over by, talking his way into her pants (through Sandra).  I don't get it.

Not a good love story.  Not a good comedy.  Not a good sleep aid.",1253232000,20,2309,4.363849765258216
3735139,2,B001OQCUZM,"A mix of modern-day Charles Dickens classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Carol/dp/B00000K3CJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Carol</a>&nbsp;along with man-whoring, GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST is a no-brainer with a pretty powerful cast that really does nothing with a script that rehashes this very old theme: regret and redemption.

The cast drew me in to see this (that and the fact that I was stuck on a flight with nothing else to do but watch an inflight film!) Matthew McConaughey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001H5X7KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>) is the lead as Connor Mead, a guy who's sexual exploits might make a Congressman blush. He's never married but always had a childhood crush on Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno/dp/B0014DFCMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno</a>). The two never got together because of Connor's youthful shyness and Jenny's need to fit in. But now that Connor is returning home for his brother's wedding, things are getting a bit weird. Connor begins seeing his late, great Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-of-California/dp/B000WCN8PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King of California</a>) in strange visions. His deceased Uncle tells him, in true Dickensonian fashion, that he'll be greeted by three ghosts this night. And they're going to show him the error of his relationship-phobic ways.

If you've read or watched any of the Christmas Carol renditions, you'll know exactly how this turns out. Like I said, no-brainer.

The sad thing about this film is that they try to make it light and fun, but fail miserably in almost all its attempts (some of you may be familiar with the falling wedding cake scene that has been used as a trailer ...and even that isn't really funny). The only thing that was consistently humorous was the bride, Emma Stone, as a neurotic who tries to keep herself together amidst the chaos of her wedding.

This one's a definite pass, even for those wishing to pass a bit of wasted time.",1252713600,2,2245,6.326797385620915
3735140,4,B001OQCUZM,"I enjoyed this movie on the airplane, and was glad I did not pay theatre popcorn prices to watch it.  It is a lightweight, funny romatic comedy - and fulfills its intent quite well.  It happens to be a spectacular date movie, IMHO.  Right up there with Jonny Depp's ""Don Juan DeMarco"".",1251936000,3,285,4.4423076923076925
3735141,1,B001OQCUZM,"Nothing much is funny, entertaining or worth watching in this movie.  I could hardly stay awake.  Matthew overacts the part.  Garner has no chemistry with MM. The girlfriend from the past is annoying.  Michael Douglas plays a sleezy, womanizing swinger type...not believeable or interesting.

The movie drags and drags. I was hoping to quickly get through the past and present......but unfortunately the future was no more interesting. Of course the whole movie is entirely predictable.

Don't waste your time or money on this one.  Not even on a rental, unless you use it as a sleep inducer!!!",1251244800,2,594,5.061855670103093
3735142,5,B001OQCUZM,"I thought this was a really good romantic comedy and had a great storyline. Conner Mead is a ladies man, and wants nothing to do with marriage. When he goes for his younger brother's wedding, the night before he meets his original girlfriend, Jenny who doesn't want anything to do with him. That night, he is visited by 3 ghosts who show him his relationships he's had in the past, present, and not-too-promising future. Unless Conner changes his ways, he will end up alone with no one who loves him. Will Connor try to fix the present to save his future? I highly recommend GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST!!!",1247788800,4,604,4.601851851851852
3735143,5,B001OQCUZM,"Matthew McConaughey is a great actor. He has covered a lot of ground in the movies that he has done but in my opinion. he's a ""natural"" for romantic comedies.

In ways, this movie reminds me of HOW TO LOOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS. Jennifer Garner and him had a great chemistry together although they should've picked a hotter looking girl. She had in this movie a ""girl next door"" quality to her. But the acting was great, there are several histerical moments. Michael Douglas was awesome on here even though he played a small part of the ghost of the sleazy Uncle Mead.

PLOT - This movie is a about a famous womenizer photographer that gets invited to his brother's wedding. At first he destroys the wedding with his negative behaviour towards the idea of marriage and ends up saving the wedding by going through ghosts of girlsfriends in his past which opens his hearts to feelings he hasn't had in years and then realizing that he always loved the girl he grew up with(Jenn Garner).

To make a long story short, if you like HOW TO LOOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS you will like this even though the stories are a bit different.
