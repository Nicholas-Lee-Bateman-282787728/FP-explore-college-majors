2196485,5,B0006V6RZK,"Although The Blackwater Lightship is about the relationship of three women--Granny (Angela Lansbury), her daughter Lily, and  Lily's daughter Helen--who find reconciliation, the subplot is moving and memorable. Declan, Granny's grandson, is dying of AIDS. He comes to Granny's house, a place of safety and love, to spend his final days. Declan's two friends come to stay beside him, loving him and caring for him. If Granny is shocked to learn about her grandson's gay lifestyle, she covers it well and moves on, welcoming Declan's friends into her home. Anyone who has a beloved family member in the gay lifestyle would do well to see this movie; it is a touching example of love and loyalty among gay men--and of repressed fear of a dreaded disease.",1356480000,,751,4.9603174603174605
2196486,3,B0006V6RZK,"If you haven't read the book, you might like this adaptation better; but you also might see it as more ordinary than it is, because the script is considerably warmer, cozier, cuddlier, and more optimistic than the book.

Yes, the performances are fine, the photography is pretty, the sets are well designed and the locations appealing.  I especially liked Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Devereaux and Gina McKee as Helen; Dianne Wiest, as Mrs. Breen, is quite competent, but many other actresses would have fit the role and done as good a job.  The men are adequate, except for Sam Robards, who's miscast as Paul.  I don't remember that he was supposed to be an American, but that's less important than the fact is that he has the character wrong: too much bluster, without the inner steel that Paul exhibits in the novel.

But it's the screenplay that fails, though I suppose it's predictable: the adaptation was made for the Hallmark Hall of Fame, not Dogme 95, after all.  So the tension between grandmother, mother, and daughter breaks down much sooner and more easily than in Toibin's story, and the reconciliation is much more advanced at drama's end.  Mrs. Breen is a much harder nut to crack in the book.  So you get a much sentimental, feel-good story, which is all right, but why bother to adapt a less edifying but more powerful novel into an ordinary tv weeper?",1320537600,,1366,4.7100840336134455
2196487,5,B0006V6RZK,"the film is definitely a little gem! I've bought it for illustration because I have the book in my literature course and I'm glad I did. Of course you need a quiet hour and no disturbance to catch the magic and the deeper truth of it. Just as one cannot read any book at any time, it is the same with films. You have to be in the right mood for such a film. Have you cought the right moment - it makes you think about your own life and family matters. Great camera work and generally marvellous acting and a really, really great Angela Lansbury!",1201564800,16,545,4.150943396226415
2196488,5,B0006V6RZK,"I copied this off of the air when it was featured on Hallmark Hall of Fame... an excellent movie, but my copy has local TV headlines running across the bottom.... Always wondered if and when it would be made available to the public on DVD/VHS... Now it is and I can get a copy.... I just adore Angela Lansbury and have been a fan of hers for many years.. She does a great job in this movie.. And Dianne Weist is good as always... the other supporting cast made this movie enjoyable.. NOT just another gay movie.... after I viewed, I bought the book.. Even more insightful. . .",1166832000,14,576,4.293577981651376
2196489,5,B0006V6RZK,"This is a very touching story based on the book of the same title.  All the actors are wonderful, but Angela Lansbury shines.  Many think this is a ""gay"" story but it is really a tale of family and discovering what is most important in life.  Filmed on location in Ireland, the cinematography is wonderful for a TV Movie.  It would be worth the price just to watch Miss Lansbury's performance.",1125878400,34,393,4.492957746478873

8043559,4,B0006V6RZK,"Wonderful character acting by the three main female characters. Fairly straightforward plot outline allows the acting to dominate the experience.  Certainly a deeper movie than the usual Hallmark genre.  The viewing experience was diminished somewhat by repeated reminders popping up that the movie is copyrighted and that this copy was a review copy, or some such language.  I don't appreciate that on a DVD that I own.",1409443200,,420,5.2388059701492535

8043562,5,B0006V6RZK,This movie is a wonderful adaptation of a great book. Angela Lansbury is fantastic in the role of the grandmother.,1384646400,,114,4.75
8043563,4,B0006V6RZK,"Anything Angela Lansbury is in just has to be good. This video is no exception. The trio of Dianne Wiest, Gina McKee and Angela Lansbury, along with a very compelling and deeply moving script, make this movie something you'll think about for a long time after the movie ends. It's a movie about reconciliation and the strength and depth of love within families. It's the story of past tragedy and pain being turned into acceptance and the triumph of love over anger and heartbreak.

The product arrived quickly and as described.",1377302400,,528,4.802197802197802
