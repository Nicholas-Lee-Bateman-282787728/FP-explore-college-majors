There was more horse riding scenes than there was actual acting scenes, probably only about 50% of the movie would make the cut. Great opportunity missed to take advantage of Fred Williamson's athleticism and create a truly dominating character, also left a whole lot of loose ends and not in a sequel kind of way. Typical spaghetti western, semi-blaxploitation, touching on the edge of white women and black men type of movie, such as Sidney Poitier was able to do in many of his films. Not one of Fred's best, he did his level best with what he was given to work with but otherwise there is much better Fred and much better blaxploitation.",1522022400,,715,4.550387596899225

7829578,3,6302668786,"For those who love double-feature discs as well as blaxploitation fare, prepare yourselves for a real treat! Two early films from Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson are featured here, including some vintage TV commercials as well as a Popeye and a Superman cartoon to complete the nostalgic experience!

'Joshua' (1976) is one of Fred's classic spaghetti western efforts in the vein of Sergio Corbucci's 'Django' and Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name"" trilogy. This film is the best of the bunch, as it's presented in a widescreen format and has decent picture quality for a standard DVD release. A few years ago, Code Red Releasing offered two of Fred's classic films in a collector's edition format, which included commentary and interviews with the man himself. Fans like myself relish these types of releases, and hopes that this film gets a proper re-release from a decent video company in the future.

When Mel and Danny were lethal weapons, and Bruce was dying hard, The Hammer was, well, starring in the Italian action flick 'Black Cobra' (1987)! Presented here in a shoddy matted format with lackluster picture quality and sound options leaves this film wide open for a digital remaster in it's original widescreen format! I would love to hear Fred talk up his memories on this particular flick, since it's had three subsequent sequels and not a decent release on home video! Blue Underground would do justice to these films, especially in quality alone!

All in all, this is a great release for fans of the genre as well as nostalgia heads! Recommended!",1433030400,,1558,4.961685823754789

7829581,1,6302668786,"Worst movie ever made,... if you've actually found this review & listing,... then you know what I'm talking about.  WORST!!!

Low even for the career-less Fred Williamson.  Horrible DVD transfer, no extra features, mind-numbing to sit through...

can't believe it's actually real.

stay away from it!",1112486400,4,300,5.434782608695652
7829582,5,6302668786,NOT YOUR TYPICAL HAMMER MOVIE OR YOUR TYPICAL WESTERN. FRED IS VERY DARK IN THS ONE AND PLAYS A MAN LOOKING FOR VENGANCE WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE PERFECTLY. BLEAK AND BRUTAL.,1102896000,2,174,4.303030303030303
7829583,1,6302668786,"I really like western movies but this one is absolutely tiresome. There's no story here, no acting, no directional touches. The cast is completely lost in a series of scenes that made no sense at all (like the shooting in a cave when Joshua killed the last outlaw. There's no dialogue here, too. Williamson gives a zombie-like performance all the time and that contributes to make this misfire a complete waste of time and a great exercise of patience.",1033084800,2,452,4.734177215189874
