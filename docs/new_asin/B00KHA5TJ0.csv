6427909,1,B00KHA5TJ0,"The main character of this show is a self proclaimed genius...who is dumb.  She is arrogant, apathetic, rude, tactless, passionless, and many more negative adjectives.  If this show were anywhere near realistic, she would be hearing ""Shut up b*tch!"" at least 20 times an episode.  She is the kind of person that people line up at her funeral just to make sure she is finally dead.

I can only imagine the longevity of this show is mostly due to Buffy/Angel fans.  No way is the longevity of this show due to the kindness and appeal of the namesake character.

The best aspects about this show, are Tamara Taylor and the occasional priceless cameo by Billy Gibbons.  Period.

This show is painful to watch.",1459814400,,705,4.67479674796748

6427967,4,B00KHA5TJ0,"There is not much to say about this season because it is working on a well-oiled pattern and there is nothing new about it. Each episode has one case of some kind of decomposed body that shows its bones and everything is supposed to come from the bones.

Then you have a few couples, married or not and these couples go on with their lives kind of routinely. Dr Lance Sweets is going to be killed in one case though: a lost bullet before Daisy delivers their child. Routine of some kind, isn't it? Arastoo Vaziri manages to drag everyone to Iran to take care of his brother who has cancer and then they have a case there, more or less underground and yet officially though under strained duress. Complex indeed! And then Angela Montenegro and Dr Jack Hodgins caress the idea of moving to Paris after Dr Jack Hodgins invents some kind of very soft plastic and makes a tremendous amount of money from it. And then Temperance Brennan and Special Agent Seeley Booth manage to announce they are leaving for some new career somewhere else after Booth has had a relapse into gambling and before Temperance delivers her second child.

Sorry but all that is as banal as a series that would be called Your crime-addicted Friends and we close on the final fare thee well hugging and embracing ceremony. It is all packed up and parceled with nice wet tears and some emotion. What can we do? It is finished then?

But what has this season brought up about the American society, about the world, about even the logic of criminals? From the spot where I stand right now, not much. It was before the nuclear deal with Iran and did not seem that optimistic about Iran and the future. Then most of these crimes were socially un-meaningful because they were nothing but crimes of passion, or crimes of greed, or crimes of blind violence or much racial tension. But there is nothing a standard mind can gnaw on or chew to reach a higher level of understanding or this American society in a globalizing world in which the USA are steadily moving towards losing their leadership.

Too bad! Just entertaining by being gross and gruesome with all these not so brilliant remnants of assassinated people! Enjoy the titillating smell of blood and taste of flesh and have some sweet nightmares.

6428018,5,B00KHA5TJ0,"If you want to simplify things - the show's primary focus is finding the killers of the remains that were discovered in strange locations. Yes, that is a major over simplifications. If that is all there was, the show would have been history after it's first season. The dialog is  carefully seeded with a combination of humor and technology. The viewer becomes ""invested in"" the lives of the characters and their interrelationships.
As Bones is my favorite show, I use it as a personal reward for exercising (has to be pretty good to work for exercise.)
Generally, each episode starts with discovery the body (frequently not in primo state) of someone who has been murdered. Then the team is brought in from their own lives to address the discovery of such things as time of death, cause of death and, of course, the murderer.",1447286400,,826,4.736111111111111

6428066,5,B00KHA5TJ0,"WARNING++++This will contain spoilers from the previous season, and hints, but no major giveaways from this season.  If you have not seen season 9 avoid the first couple paragraphs++++

The tenth season of Bones shakes the show up a lot.  The fist handful of episodes are spent tying up the ""conspiracy"" story line that ended season 9 with Booth in handcuffs.  They do not draw out the story too long, and end up wrapping it up within the first couple episodes in a somewhat anti-climatic end (at least in my opinion).  Of course, as most know, there is a major death early on as a part of that story like which affects the characters throughout the remainder of the season.

The show keeps the case of the week format tied together with larger overall arcs.  The big theme for the season is the various character relationships (especially Booth and Brennan) and the next step the various characters are taking.  There is a new addition to the team in the form of a new FBI agent James Aubrey played by John Boyd.  While it is always tricky introducing new characters in a long running established show, Boyd seemed to have good chemistry with the rest of the cast, and his character was well written so the integration was pretty smooth.  Especially after he found his footing with the character.

Toward the end of the season there is a tie back to the Pelant story line and the money he stole from Hodgins, and a post-death Pelant threat which may or may not tie into season 11.  The team is definitely left in a state of flux at the end of the season, but not with as big a cliffhanger as season 9 ended on.

For those who get the DVDs the bonuses include deleted scenes for select episodes.  A making of feature on the series' 200th episode, a  gag reel, and a feature on the character that was killed off.  Not a ton of material, but good for what is there.  My only real complaint is that the show stopped being released on blu ray after season 8 (which is more due to the studio than the quality of the show itself).  If that is a big deal to you then streaming may be the way you want to go, but otherwise we are just stuck with DVD.",1444867200,13,2142,4.352644836272041
6428067,5,B00KHA5TJ0,"I was prepared to be disappointed since the show has been running for 10 years. I figured they would be running out of interesting plots and it would be winding down. Very wrong assumption on my part. I have not even finished this season and the stories and acting may be one of my best seasons. The very first episode had me in tears with the death of one of the main characters and the struggle to put Booth and Brennan's issues in Season 9 behind them. There is a new FBI agent played by John Boyd who fits right in to the dynamic team that has made Bones such a hit.

This season, as with the previous 9, is worth watching and owning to be able to watch again.",1444348800,7,664,4.107692307692307

6428094,5,B00KHA5TJ0,this is a good watch. Season 10 looks really promising for our cast of investigators,1439769600,,84,4.666666666666667
6428095,4,B00KHA5TJ0,"This series was the pilot for all the other similar type shows that I became such a fan of such as Castle, NCIS, CSI, GOTHAM and other such
shows.  Infact it was a tidy little film  TIN MAN staring Emily Deschanels sister Zooey that really turned me into a Bones fan along with the other
shows.  Bones has a great primary cast, though the secondary cast (some of them) are less than great.  The Interns drive me crazy except for
Zach (first 4 seasons) and Wendel; the rest suck.  And in this episode after Booth survives a plot to destroy his reputation (and job) their buddy
Sweets (who I also disliked) gets killed.  But behold, they replace him with an even more obnoxious fellow named Abury (!), a Sweets look-a-like
and as dislikeable.  Come on, I enjoyed seeing Booth and Bones working together (and bickering) not Booth with a creepy partner.  Maybe  because
in the show (and real life) Bones is ""with child"" again.  That part of the storyline I like.  Then Bones gets this buys this enormous house that might
satisfy even a mansion lover like  ""Fat Albert"" Gore and all seems well.  There are some good story plots as usual throughout the somewhat split
season and even Daisy comes back much more likeable than when she left.  But Bones has changed somewhat, not as feisty as in the past,
almost as if she senses the series in winding down as I think it is.  There is kind of surprising ending that took me by surprise.  The final episode
brings  back memories of Pelant and a killer that imitated him; in fact may have worked with him.  I thought this would carry over in to the new
season (yes, there is  going to  be season 11.....I  think) but no, they captured the naughty person..sadly.  Maybe this person will escape and
renew  the plot line.  The final episode ended oddly; as if at the time of the filming (or photographing) they were not sure if they would be  back.
The episode ended with  Booth and Bones leaving Washinton.  But I believe they will be back (or else!).  Advice to the Producers, get rid of
Abury, he is a pain in the tail bone!  Get rid of Edison too; not much of an actor and not believable as a scientist.  Camille is cute as usual as is
Angela but Hoggins is a fool for not taking his billions back; give some to charity and keep the rest; its honest earnings!!!  And please, stop adding
new people; the cast you have is just fine the way it is.  Make Wendel permanent along with that new female intern, the goofy one who stands up
to Bones sometimes.  And if the producers feel they need more blacks, bring back Dr. Goodman; he was excellent.
  If the new season is the final one, make it a real bang up one!  I would like to see Zooey have another cameo; she was the one who started it
all with me and these shows and besides, she is very cute.  I don't really like her show, but I do like her!  Perhaps bring all the former people back
for a real finale; rumor had it that Booth and Bones may meet the spirits of the victims whose deaths they investigated.  That would be a bit weird
but mystical and perhaps uplifting.  FOUR STARS only for the split in the season, but the series overall is still outstanding.  I just ordered season
10 DVD; I have the season on my Video Library.",1434153600,6,3222,4.356902356902357
6428096,4,B00KHA5TJ0,"Fox's long-running crime drama ""Bones"" gets a tenth season, with its polished routine of crimes of the week, solved by FBI Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) and his partner, pathologist Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan (Emily Deschanel), and the criminology team at the Jeffersonian Institute. First, however, the team will have to find a way to get Booth out of jail and cleared, after he was framed at the end of the ninth season. Once out of jail, Booth will face a tough period of readjustment, trying to get back his crime-fighting mojo back while learning to live with Bones and daughter Christine all over again.

The new season brings some changes. The team will lose a key player at a dramatic moment early in the season, and have to work in a replacement after an emotional farewell. Another primary character will develop a emotional bond with one of the rotational lab interns, one that threatens their official relationship. Still another will strike it rich, a couple of season after having been cleaned out by a particularly nasty serial killer. Yet another character will revisit a gambling habit that threatens a job and a relationship. And, one key character will become pregnant. And those events are just character development. There is a fresh lot of challenging cases that will need solving.

Those week to week cases continue to be innovative and interesting, challenging the team and the viewer to keep up. At the same time, the series hasn't lost its sense of humor, or its willingness to experiment. As an example, you just have to see this season's throwback Hitchcock episode. ""Bones"" is still good fun and recommended to its loyal fans in its tenth season.",1430697600,30,1681,4.915492957746479
