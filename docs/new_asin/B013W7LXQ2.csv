7374047,3,B013W7LXQ2,"Overall a watchable movie, however I'll admit I almost gave up after the first 10 minutes, it would be interesting to see how many times the word ""b-t-h"" is used in this movie.",1447459200,,176,4.363636363636363
7374048,5,B013W7LXQ2,"""Tangerine"" is the perfect example of a film that succeeds because its strong character development. The characters--all of them-- are wonderfully nuanced and deeply layered. The plot isn't much, and it doesn't need to be much.. Hilarious at times. Painful at times. I loved it. One of the best of 2015, for sure.",1447200000,7,313,4.9245283018867925
7374049,5,B013W7LXQ2,This movie was great. Very realistic and entertaining. I will watch it again.,1447113600,2,77,5.0
7374050,5,B013W7LXQ2,"Set in the sun drenched horizon of Hollywood, Tangerine follows a specific day in the life of two transitioning working girls and the Armenian cab driver that they interact with occasionally. The film's claim to fame is that it was exclusively shot using three Apple iPhone 5s's along with some phone grips and $4.99 software. The film is exceptionally well shot, with occasional shaky camera movements to add authenticity to the pace at which the characters move throughout the city. The city itself acts as a background character filling the scenes with that western Sun hue like a yellow/orange glow shimmering on the liquor stores and cash checking bodegas known for littering the poorer areas of Los Angeles. We open the film with Sin-dee(Katana Kiki Rodriguez) and Alexandra(Mya Taylor) catching up after Sin-dee has just been released from being incarcerated for the past twenty-eight days. She's on the lookout for her man who Alexandra told her has been seeing a real fish(girl). The ensuing plot follows the two working girls through the slums of Hollywood and Los Angelas diverting when Alexandra has to get ready for her singing performance at a local bar, this is when Sin-dee goes on a tear to find the woman who's been sleeping with Chester(James Ransone, her boyfriend. The characters in this film are obnoxious, crass, immature, loud, and so outwardly flawed it might garner hesitation to see anything redeemable. But just like their own outward appearance, if you look closely enough, past the rough edges, there is a vulnerability and a beauty that is unparalleled. This is the true artwork of this film, to look closer while everyone else looks away. While we take a respite from the adventures of Sin-dee and Alexandra we meet Razmik(Karren Karagulian) an Armenian cab driver who occasionally will pay for sexual favors from our two main characters. We see his varied interactions with his fares, an old woman who's dog has just died, a couple of hungover/drunk teenagers who puke in his car, and his unsuccessful pick up attempt of a transvestite prostitute who turns out to be a real woman. He has a wife and baby at home, and his mother in law is visiting for the Christmas holiday. He uses Alexandra's singing show as an excuse to make his exit from the stressful family dinner table. Knowing that each scene was shot with a cell phone camera is truly remarkable, the pure richness of the colors that pop from the LA sky, the sun shading half the buildings in darkness and revealing the other part in the light definitely gives credence to the duality of the city's persona. The cinematography is extraordinary, capturing real life movements of people in the background, on the street, sitting in a moving environment. It naturally flowing and teeming with life, anxiety, dread, frenzy all bubbling to the surface with the tonal and atmospheric score to beautiful put together a work of art. Tangerine is about finding people, and hoping to find a bit of yourself in them. At the end of the film Sin-dee finds Chester. Alexandra and Razmik also converge, with his mother in law and wife coming to find that he has been seeing Alexandria and Sin-dee for the occasional blowjob. His wife not caring due to him being the provider and his mother in law being disgusted by the whole situation leave the donut shop in which all of our main characters have met. Chester is confronted with the girl Sin-dee has been assaulting for sleeping with him and he admits having to turn her out to make sure she was a good product, obviously showing the kind of boyfriend he is. The film devolves from here with a scene that leaves us cold, and leaves the main characters vulnerable and verbally stunted. But as we move farther away from this moment, we're rewarded with a final showcase of kindness, friendship, and compassion. And though we've been through the ringer as the audience seeing what a day consists of for these girls, there is a moment for a quiet, happy, reprieve in the company of each other.",1444694400,30,4017,4.823188405797102
7374051,4,B013W7LXQ2,"This is a very different film, it pulls you in several directions emotionally at all times.  The plot is about as focused as the movie Clerks, in that it's mostly composed of side stories meshed together and the main story doesn't end up having any real pay off.  It's just ""a day in the life"" of several people who know each other, some are good, some bad, but all are somewhat morally ambiguous, just like real life.  I just remember leaving the theatre feeling like the film was how I felt being in LA, and that meant it felt far too realistic to the bad parts of life, it's real LA - gritty as f*ck.

Shot wonderfully on iPhone, it looks professional and the actors?  It was nice to see real people playing real people for a change - no recognizable faces allow you to focus on other elements of the film.

I felt weird about the film, I still do, but there's something about it that is just - interesting.  It's new and different if nothing else, and that's worth seeing.  You may feel bored at times, you will certainly be unsatisfied at the end, but sometimes, we need those films to remind us that not everything in life is clean cut, or even just clean.",1444262400,9,1162,4.32258064516129

7374055,4,B013W7LXQ2,"This is a day in the life movie about a couple of transvestite prostitutes from West Hollywood.  Equal parts darkly funny and distressing, the movie does a great job at showing how hard it is to find respite while in such a maligned profession.  Shot on an iPhone 5, it also demonstrates how resourceful filmmakers can be while working under extreme limitations.  Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor give strong performances as the prostitutes, but I particularly enjoyed James Ransome's (Iggy from season 2 of The Wire) turn as the hookers' two-faced pimp.",1508457600,,558,4.978494623655914

7374058,5,B013W7LXQ2,"Very ""independent"" movie in style and production - these are amateur actors and if you can eventually accept that these people are not acting the characters but are actually being the characters, then that's when you say ""Whoa!"" The first bit of the movie, maybe 30-minutes, was pedantic and repetitive, except to establish the crazy level of the characters. But after that, the movie becomes an amazing take down on prejudices and presumptions, right up to the end when it becomes incredibly moving.

I hated the beginning and stopped playback more than once; but by the time the movie ended, I didn't want it to be over.",1502582400,4,622,4.813084112149533

7374060,5,B013W7LXQ2,"What a brilliant film! So full of colours and character. It felt like it grew in confidence (maybe the Duplass bros got involved) but those corridors we're looking lit as the drama builts and the acting doesn't drop a moment - even as the narrative techniques kick in of following our sacrificial Armenian cab driver (amazing b-plot) we still believe the documentary vibe; despite the sheer cinema, so hats off to the two leads.

7374077,3,B013W7LXQ2,"I don't mean that in an impressive way. Sort of a glorious car accident sort of way.
Movie is about two trannies in Hollywood trying to find a cheating boyfriend. Much has been said about the style as it was filmed on iPhone 6s with custom built anamorphic adapters. That simply means they turned the cell phone held sideways view into the 2.35:1 ratio like movie theaters have.
The movie exudes the Hollywood Boulevard lifestyle and the camera style is so perfect for that. Over-saturated to nab that West Coast sun and the camera seems to always be following the two main characters power walking down the street, barely keeping up. In this world everyone walks, few can afford cabs, let alone cars, and the bus is not an option, so thus we walk.
Some serious walking though.",1470441600,,777,4.63768115942029

Would love to see more films with all transgender cast. What I also find absolutely amazing is that this film was made with iPhones! Not cameras but iPhones. How cool is that?  Watching this movie made me want to call up my sassy transgender friend. I did and all she said was IM GETTING MY WEAVE DONE B#%CH CANT TALK NOW! before she hung up the phone...so like her.

Tangerine on the other hand? Fun, fast, sad, believable, gross and completely sympathetic. It does everything a great movie should do; like you to the outer edges of real emotion with a real experience. NICE!!!",1468281600,4,463,5.105263157894737

This is not for the narrow-minded.

7374098,5,B013W7LXQ2,"I know the street life. i was living on the street for 6 months when I was 14.
It was so cold and there's nowhere to go. I missed the soft warm bed. Every day when I wake up it is so hard to spend time for a day. Being hunger is really pain. But most of all, lonely is the biggest issue.
Then I found job, I thought. But that was another trap.
In this movie a whole bunch of women are living on the street. They are having a hard days in LA. The street is hot during the day and cold during at night. So they fight during the day and suffer at night.
No one to blame.
The title Tangerine is the color of the image of the film. It is between yellowish and orange. it seems warm but also strange somehow. Cannot get use to it. That is the street life.
But living in LA, you won't die of hunger at least. You will at least survive. The government will feed you so.
But it is lonely and cold that makes you feel so hard.
These women are not all dirty or wanna be denied. They have their own personalities and in somehow they are even want to talk to kind of women.
That's the power of the director who created these charactors.
But again, the director wanted to talk about the street life. I guess.
We can enough feel that from the movie and that is exactly what the director wanted.
It is worth watching for me. Thinking back of my footsteps. How much I suffered when young. How they are suffering.
I saw a lot of women on the street when I was living in LA like them and didn't understood them but after this movie I did.
It was wonderfully shot, acted movie and I can see why many people are talking about this film.",1460764800,,1615,4.003095975232198

Then best friend Alexandra lets slip that her pimp boyfriend has been sleeping with another street girl and she is none too pleased and sets out on a cross town rant to find the biatch and ruin her Christmas  and his.

Co star here is Mya Taylor who is a transgender actor and I have to say she is superb as the struggling street worker with ambitions of bettering herself. Sin Dee Rella is a force of nature and has a range of expletives that sometimes blot out all meaning of what she is saying. There is another plot running of an Armenian taxi driver and that works really well too.

Now this has had a fair hit of hype and has been praised and derided in conflicting amounts. It was shot entirely on 3 iPhones with some steady cam help and a cheap app  so for an indie it is ticking all the boxes and I have to say it looks really good for all that. The plot is fairly original and the subject matter is interesting. The acting is mostly to the far end of extremely good.

7374101,3,B013W7LXQ2,"Hats off to a brilliantly imaginative piece of writing, directing and acting! Welcome to tranny-world, a slice-of-life movie filmed entirely on an Apple i-pod and edited with over-the-counter software. Unless you already have a tranny in your life to love, the characters are gross and off-putting and it takes a good 20-30 minute to find a coherent answer to the question Why am I watching this sh*t? because the characters inner and outer lives crash and jangle against everything that might be called normal society rather than street-trash hustle. But later rather than sooner the hopes, aspirations, loves and entanglements of its protagonists start to cohere in ways that make it watchable and even from time to time enjoyable in a sad and perverse way.  The philosophical zenith of the movie is the debate amongst family and friends of the Armenian taxi-driver, Razmik, who has just deserted his family on New Years Eve to go to Donut Time to seek the company of the tranny hookers that he knows and loves and from whom he purchases services  most recently Alexandra in a car wash tryst given some brief but sufficient moment of privacy as the cab takes its ablution beneath the brushes.  Razmiks wife and mother-in-law descend upon Donut Time where the trannies leap to his defense with the argument  is this really cheating on his beautiful wife if he goes down on a tranny better hung than he is?  And is it wrong for the beautiful wife to look the other way if he is otherwise a hard-working breadwinner, and the only one in the entire family who is working?  These are the deeper questions left for the viewer to ponder.

The film has the unstoppable fierce energy and direction of a Run Lola Run without the second chance. Sin-Dee (Rella) is just out of jail and discovers that her boyfriend-pimp Chester has been unfaithful to her -- who would have imagined such a thing possible among a tight knit group of such sexual purity and chastity? -- with the most humiliating love object of all, a ""fish.""  If you do not already know what a fish is, you will find out soon enough as Sin-Dee begins her madcap romp of revenge against Chester and the fish.  Things are what they are and this movie gives a great glimpse of a world most of us would never know no matter how many time we pass by and see the trannies working the streets at Highland Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard and environs in the City of the Angels.",1460160000,,2426,4.636363636363637

I was interested in this film because it was shot entirely on an iphone for that reason alone it is worth watching. Apparently the script was largely improvised from the actors. The story is funny and sad and shows the value of true friendship in a not so ideal situation.,1456876800,2,425,4.68
7374114,5,B013W7LXQ2,"When I first heard of Tangerine, I wondered if it was a movie adaptation of Edward Bloor's classic middle-grade novel TANGERINE. It isn't.  In fact, Tangerine is wholly original.

Tangerine's technical claim to fame is that it was shot entirely on the iPhone 5S.  I certainly can't make movies this good with my cell phone, so bravo.  It doesn't look like Roger Deakins shot it, but it looks perfectly respectable for an indie movie.  You wouldn't know if someone didn't tell you.

Tangerine is set in sun-drenched Los Angeles on Christmas Eve.  It's a land of bright colors and intersecting cultures.  One of those cultures is that of transgender sex workers.  Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) just got out of jail and is enjoying a holiday donut with her best friend, Alexandra (Mya Taylor).  Unfortunately, Alexandra lets it slip that Sin-Dee's boyfriend cheated on her - even though she's been gone less than a month.  Sin-Dee instantly marches off in a rage, ready to make her boyfriend and the girl he cheated on her with pay.

Meanwhile, cabdriver Razmik (Karren Karagulian) ferries an odd assortment of fares around the city.

The acting in Tangerine is very natural, but also full of passion and fire.  This is no mumblecore film.  These characters are loud, because they've learned that's how they have to be to make their voices heard.  Almost all of them do awful things during the course of the film, but they also expose their vulnerable underbellies.  They can't survive without their communities, but their community ties are fragile.

I also have to give props to the soundtrack.  A climatic Christmas song is beautifully chosen.  The pounding synths that accompany Sin-Dee tearing down the streets of Los Angeles are infectious and riotous.  The soundtrack sets the tone, and the story rises to it.

Tangerine is a hilarious film, and a touching one.  It's a slice of life that runs through the full gamut of human emotions, finding bitter humor in the darkest spots.  When the credits begin, that silence is a welcome space to release yourself from the entrenching world of the film.",1456185600,,2101,4.903409090909091

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

Director Sean Baker is back with one of his low budget wonders, this time shot entirely on an iPhone5s smartphone. The setting is Hollywood and his protagonists are trans-gender prostitutes (or should I say sex-workers?) Sin-dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) and Alexandra (Mya Taylor).

The opening scene (shot in a donut shop) grabs you right away as just out of jail Sin-dee threatens to find her pimp/boyfriend Chester, who has been cheating on her with a non-transgender woman, Dinah, another prostitute. Alexandra attempts to calm her friend down but Sin-dee is determined to locate the offending parties and mete out her own brand of ""justice.""

Although it has its moments, the Tangerine plot gets bogged down with Sin-dee's for the most part one note performance. She grabs Dinah's arm (and unconvincingly drags Dinah without any real resistance from her) to a near empty bar where Alexandra is scheduled to perform as a singer. In the bathroom, Sin-dee and Dinah do meth together and then Sin-dee finally softens up and helps Dinah with her hair.

There's a subplot involving an Armenian cabdriver, Razmik, whose preference for trans-gender prostitutes is thwarted when he discovers to his chagrin that he's just invited a non-transgender woman of the night into his cab. Later we discover Razmik is married and his mother-in- law suspects that he's not been working late at night as he's been claiming.

Things come to a head back at the donut shop where Razmik's mother- in- law calls her daughter and she shows up just in time to hear her mother exposing Razmik as having (in her own words) an interest in ""gay prostitutes."" But the wife doesn't want to hear her mother's concerns and they all return home to sort the rest of the shenanigans out.

Meanwhile, Chester confesses to Sin-dee that he had a one-time affair with Alexandra. Sin-dee stalks off and attempts to hail some cars with johns passing by, but is doused with a noxious liquid. In a touching moment, Alexandra helps Sin-dee clean off and then lets her wear her wig. Dinah is rebuffed at the brothel where Sin-dee first encountered her, as the madam there informs that someone has taken her place.

If all this sounds a bit silly, it is. Score points for the irreverent tone but Sin-dee's quest for ""revenge"" grows tiresome. Taylor gives the more sensitive performance of the two principals, with Rodriguez displaying less subtlety as a woman with a bad case of anger management. Ultimately, Tangerine, with its message of friendship triumphant, has its heart in the right place, but there's little here that will appeal to the intellect.",1454716800,,2682,4.931263858093127

In some ways, it's a ground-breaker, and I'm a big fan of indie film. It's about two transexual prostitutes in LA, very close friends. They each have their own dreams, one to marry her pimp, the other to become a legitimate singer. Tangerine [I suspect the director is referring to the color of the LA sun and how it infuses LA with it's light] is all about one day in their lives, mostly spent together, and where that day takes them. If you can't handle strong language, forget this film, but if it's not a problem, follow it through. Look for the colorful, interesting shots of LA as the day progresses - the use of natural sunlight as it waxes and wanes is compelling and unique. The two characters personalities are very well developed without drawn-out dialog scenes, so watch and listen carefully. Somewhere in there we can learn a great deal about what real friendship and loyalty is about.",1452988800,4,1027,4.556756756756757

7374164,4,B013W7LXQ2,"This delightful odd-ball dramedy is another interesting film made around the edges of L.A., society from the talented Sean Baker, who also made the excellent, smart Starlet, about a very likable druggy porn actress.

This film is about two transsexual prostitutes who are best friends, and their series of misadventures as they try to track down Sin-Dees boyfriend/pimp.  He has broken her heart by reportedly fooling around with a non-transsexual woman while Sin-Dee was in prison for a month on a drug rap.

Shot on an iPhone, and bursting with energy, playfulness, sexuality, and just the right amount of sadness and reality, its surprising how much fun, and how often funny the film is, while still allowing these outsider characters dignity and heart.

It sometimes feels a bit episodic and repetitive, and a couple of bits are humor are forced.  Also, for the most part these are not actors, and while that raw, unprofessional quality can nicely add to the sense of truth, it can also occasionally hurt the comic timing, or take away from the emotion of a scene.

But overall, this is a terrifically original American indie, made from the heart, and on far less than a shoestring, It gives voice and humor to leading characters who at best would be a throw away one line joke in most Hollywood films.

7374174,5,B013W7LXQ2,"Sean Bakers Tangerine"" is no doubt one of the most original and peculiar movies Ive seen all year. Its characters are loud and unapologetic, even obnoxious at times, and aren't inherently likable. But as were immediately thrown into their drama from the first scene we, strangely, invest ourselves in them and their day full of craziness. If you know anything about the film, its most likely the fact that it was entirely shot on the iPhone 5S (a pretty remarkable feat in my eyes). However, this isn't the reason to see the movie. Or, at least, the most important one. Whats striking is its authenticity and effortless comedy, which can mostly be accredited to the films two leads Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor.

They play two transgender prostitutes working in a distinct stretch of Los Angeles (with a Donut shop serving as their headquarters). The film takes place on Christmas Eve, in which Sin-Dee (Rodriguez) is released from jail to find that her boyfriend/pimp has been cheating on her. She and her best friend Alexandra (Taylor) set out to find him and his new companion, raising hell the whole way. The movie is mostly an outrageous romp, presenting a look into a world that most audiences haven't ever been exposed to. It isn't worried about being politically correct and, unlike other recent films about transgender characters, isn't a victim narrative. Its completely raunchy and dirty, with an unmistakable charm thats easy to latch on to.

Director Sean Baker skillfully realizes the iPhones capabilities, fully capturing the sunlit orange hue that frames the characters in almost every scene. The fact that its a Christmas movie is merely a cherry on top of a beautifully made piece of work. Not a flawless picture, but a rigorously thought out and executed one. Its a significant milestone in independent filmmaking, and shouldnt be missed by anyone interested in that world.",1448755200,6,1900,4.990536277602524
