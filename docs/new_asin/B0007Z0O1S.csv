2254686,4,B0007Z0O1S,"Rachel Scott loved God and served Him.  She has become an inspiration to a generation of young Christian believers because of how she lived her life and how she faced death at the hands of Harris and Klebold.

Her father, Darrell Scott, recounts Rachel's life in his presentation.  He speaks in front of a church congregation and shares his and his daughter's side of the story.  The story is very moving.  It is well worth watching.  Rachel's death is actually inspiring other young people to be bold and stand up for good.

I gave it a 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish Mr. Scott had reordered his presentation to be more chronological (for my tastes).  All the information is there mind you.  The message is very moving.",1288224000,2,730,4.553846153846154
2254687,3,B0007Z0O1S,"There are a few events or occasions in every generation where time seems to stop. Those old enough to remember J.F.K's assassination tend to not only remember the news reports, but remember where they were and who they were with when they heard about his death. Many people still remember how they felt when they heard that the space shuttle Challenger was destroyed just seconds after lift-off, or more recently, when they began to hear news reports about planes plowing into the World Trade Center in New York City. Another tragedy that stopped a nation, and really an entire continent, was the shootings in Columbine High School on April 20, 1999.

As with all tragedies, there arose out of Columbine stories of untold grief along with stories of great hope and rejoicing. Untold Stories on Columbine places the spotlight on just one of the young people who lost her life that day. Rachel Joy Scott was only seventeen years old but had placed her faith in God and sought to be a light in the darkness of the halls at her high school. From all accounts she was a fun, happy and vivacious young woman who was bold in sharing her faith. The DVD is a video recording of a speech her father, Darrell Scott, gave at a Baptist church in Tennessee. It also contains footage from Rachel's funeral which was broadcast worldwide on CNN.

Apparently only a couple of weeks before the shootings Rachel, true to her convictions, had witnessed to the two gunmen. Her father recounts what has become a popular but unsubstantiated account of the events surrounding her death. Rachel had already been shot twice while standing outside the school building. One of the gunmen, seeing that she was wounded, grabbed her hair and pulled her head towards him, asking ""Do you still believe in God?"" When she replied, ""You know I do,"" he immediately shot her through the temple. This same affirmation of faith was attributed to Cassie Bernall (and was later disproven, despite books and songs in her honor) and to Valeen Schnurr who survived. It is entirely possible that the gunmen asked this question of multiple people. We will never know with any certainty whether Rachel's final words were a statement of her faith, but what we do know is that she was a remarkable young woman who left a legacy that has since inspired thousands or even tens of thousands of young people.

The untold stories of Columbine are not the stories of Rachel or Cassie, but of those who were stirred to follow their example in finding meaning and refuge in Christ. While many stories that arose in the aftermath of that day have long since been proven false, what no one can disprove or take away is the faith of those young women and many of the other students. We cannot know how many lives were touched and how many hearts stirred to hear of young believers who lost their lives - maybe as martyrs and maybe not - leaving behind a legacy of faith.

Darrell Scott is a natural speaker and his presentation is powerful and stirring. He shares stories from his daughter's past and relates many of her premonitions that her life was not going to last long. Equally powerful are the testimonies of Rachel's friends and family as they pour out their hearts at her funeral. The grief, still so new and fresh, is palpable. I had two concerns with the presentation. First, it seemed that he must have already given the speech hundreds of times, for it seemed to be done with little spark or emotion. Secondly, discerning viewers may find themselves squirming at times, as Scott is a Pentecostal and holds back nothing, even in front of his Baptist audience. Knowing his audience he attempts to explain his beliefs on visions, dreams and direct revelation from God, but in the end I agree with a friend he mentions in his speech who always encourages him to ""show me in the Word!""

This is an interesting DVD and well worth the 80-minute investment. Whether or not Rachel Scott died with a confession of her faith upon her lips, we know from her life and from the legacy she left behind that she believed deeply in the Lord and was called home from that bloodstained field to her Savior's side. Her life and death were both a powerful testimony to the grace of God.",1130457600,34,4216,4.646112600536193

2254716,5,B0007Z0O1S,"The first thing that I found particularly unsettling was at the very beginning, when Rachel's father, Darrell declared that the Columbine massacre was this generation's (technically last generation's at this point) moment that they would never forget. And at the time, it certainly was. Darrell wasn't saying that because he was proud. He was saying it because, like most people, you couldn't imagine anything worse happening. But this was filmed in 1999, and two years later, 9/11 happened and pretty much dwarfed everything that came before it.

And what was so particularly unsettling is how many times these shootings have happened since then. It's hard to believe, but it's been 15 years since the horrific shootings at Columbine. And the world had never quite see anything like this before. Needless to say, everyone was shocked at how this was possible, and how two kids could have done all this. But 15 years later, that shock has become way to familiar.

The stories that Darrell tells in this video are very moving, and heartbreaking. But it really allows you to get to know, Rachel the person, not, Rachel the victim. And by the end of the sermon, you really feel like you know Rachel personally.

That is what makes the final part of this video so incredibly hard to watch. After Darrell's sermon, you see some of Rachel's funeral. Rachel's funeral was broadcast live on CNN only fours days after the shootings. And because of that, it has become a time capsule of sorts. You are literally transported back to 1999, and it feels like yesterday. Her funeral was able to capture the true emotions and feelings, that couldn't be captured today.

You see all of her friends and family sharing stories about Rachel, and that's when it really hits home. You realize that those weren't just stories Darrell was telling. Rachel was indeed a real person, who was loved by many. And when you hear the pain in their voices, it sends chills down your spine.

For me, this was impossible to watch without breaking down in tears. It actually gave me the shakes. But I think it's important for everyone to watch. And I encourage everyone 13+ years old to watch it, whatever your religious beliefs are. It really does promote a good message of kindness and compassion.",1395878400,8,2264,4.809768637532134

2254728,1,B0007Z0O1S,"Worse Movie I ever bought. Boring! It doesn't do anything for the other people who paid their lives on that horrible day. I did watch the movie Dawn Anna, so maybe that was why I was so dissapointed in this film.",1367107200,4,212,4.195121951219512

2254731,2,B0007Z0O1S,"As someone who has read the ""Journals of Rachel Scott"", as well as ""Rachel's Tears"", and been completely inspired by Rachel's story, this video was not what I was expecting.  I thought there would be footage from different events surrounding Columbine, never-before-seen photographs, or interviews with family and friends all relating to Rachel and the other students killed at Columbine.  However, that was not the case.  The sole content of this video is a taped performance of Darrell Scott speaking to an audience at a Baptist church in Nashville, Tennessee.  While I did enjoy some of the points he makes, and he does share a few photos and journal entries, there was essentially nothing new about Rachel, Columbine, or the other victims that I hadn't already read about or seen before.  It is basically just a religious talk by Darrell, so if you're not in the mood to hear him just speaking for 45 minutes, I wouldn't recommend buying this.  If you want to learn more about Rachel Scott and/or Columbine, you're better off reading the two books I mentioned and checking out other free resources and videos online.  Darrell also includes some of his own political views, so if you don't agree with his views 100%, you might not enjoy the video as much either.  I'm not trying to give the product a completely negative review.  Columbine has played a huge role in my life, and Darrell Scott is a fine speaker....but this just wasn't what I was hoping for when I purchased it, and I felt like others should know what the video includes.  I hope that helps!",1357776000,16,1560,4.7444444444444445

Rachell knew one and a half years before it happened and Rachell told her father that she would live only a short life and that something very big and spectactular would happen. Rachell made a committment to the Lord and held fast to the end.  I do not know if I could have held fast if I were in that same place.  I know that Rachell's life is an example of how all of us should live.  I shed tears as this story unfolded It is wonderful that many youth have given their life to Jesus because of the faithfulness of Rachell to Jesus.  I still shed tears when I think of what hapened and I have to ask myself  Can I do the same thing. Thanks, Jerry Warfield ?",1331596800,2,800,4.230263157894737
