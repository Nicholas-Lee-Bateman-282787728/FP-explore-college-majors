Go to [...] and buy only with $12.99

Anyway, the story was written by Great Rabindranath Tagore - but in this movie, the direction was poor and below standard, though there are couple of lovely Tagore songs... so if you want to buy, buy with your own risk...

Btw, it is hilarious that the Film Director, Rituporno Ghosh, was a Male person, but he has decided to cast himself as an elderly woman for a short role!!!  and speaks in a hilarious, annoying female voice - can you believe??? Hats down to ""his"" imagination!!!
So again, if you want to buy, buy with your own risk...",1330819200,,694,4.203007518796992
8461183,3,B0057XXJKI,"Raima and Riya Sen, yester-year's veteran actress Suchitra Sen's adorable grand daughters are a treat to watch in Rituparno Ghosh's new Bengali movie `Noukadubi'. The film which is based on Tagore's story from his famous collection `Golpo Guccha' premiered in the International Film Festival of India in Goa.

`Noukadubi' is a Bengali film under the banner of Subhash Ghai's Mukta Searchlight Films that revolves around the intertwined stories of four individuals who fall prey to circumstances in life. The cast of the film includes actors Prasenjit Chatterjee and Jishu Sengupta besides the Sen siblings. The film is being made both in Bengali and dubbed in Hindi as Kashmakash.

The story starts with the blossoming love between a law student of Kolkata, Romesh (played by Jishu Sengupta) and his friend's sister Hemnalini (Raima Sen), who is an ardent admirer of Tagore's literary works. A sudden summon from Romesh's father in their native village sets the young lovers apart. On reaching his village, Romesh is forced to marry Susheela, a poor widow's daughter. On his journey back with his newly wed wife, Romesh falls victim to a whirlwind storm in the river. Romesh finds himself wrecked on the shores of the river and spots a just alive young bride nearby. Without knowing her identity, Romesh brings her to Kolkata. Here circumstances unveil the real identity of the young bride to be Kamala (played by Riya Sen) who is the newly wed bride of a doctor in Kashi, Dr Nalinaksha Chatterjee (Prashenjit Chatterjee). Situations interconnect all these four characters and it is for the audience to find out whether love survives amidst misunderstand able situations and social taboos.

While this is Raima's third film with Ghosh after Chokher Bali and Antar Mahal, this film is a great leap for Riya Sen as her character, Kamala puts her on the right focus to demonstrate her acting skills. The music and literary work in the film are obviously rich under the influence of Tagore. This piece of art is also Ghosh's tribute to Gurudev on the occasion of his 150th anniversary.

Subhash Ghai is said to have cut the length of the Hindi version to a brief 90 minutes and ace music director Gulzar is said to have translated the original works of Rabindra sangeet into Hindi for the up-market multiplex audience to understand and cherish.",1312416000,2,2340,4.976982097186701
