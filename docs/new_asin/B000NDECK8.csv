8176787,5,B000NDECK8,"This is the diary of Eddie, a rare black leopard, who was rescued by a family who run a wildlife reserve.  From birth to adult, it is amazing to see this beautiful animal as he interacts with the family and becomes an adult.  It also is amazing to see such a large wild cat, with the heart of a playful kitten.
I would recommend this to any wildlife lover, or any cat lover.",1219968000,,374,4.109589041095891
8176788,5,B000NDECK8,"""Growing Up Black Leopard"" is one of my favorite animal programs.  It documents the earliest days of a young baby black leopard (Eddie) born in a Colorado animal sanctuary to newly arrived black leopard parents.  Almost immediately he faces a life-threatening crisis due to his inability to tolerate goat's milk - the standard fare for newborn big cats.  Fortunately, his caretakers' patience and innovations overcome the problem, and from ther Eddie thrives.

It is impossible not to be taken in by Eddie and his playful antics - both with his caretakers, and their dogs.  My only wish was that they could have spent the time with him that the Seuss' did with Bart the grizzly bear.",1214784000,,683,4.853448275862069
