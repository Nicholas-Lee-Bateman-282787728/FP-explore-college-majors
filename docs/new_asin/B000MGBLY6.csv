2735787,4,B000MGBLY6,"This is a simple, easy to follow yoga routine.  There are a lot of relaxation poses integrated in the workout, so one doesn't get too tired...nevertheless, one does get a workout!, especially on the abdominals.  Unlike a lot of high speed/flow yoga DVDs, this one really gives you the time to get into the pose, feel its effect and move out of it mindfully.  I give the instructor an A+ for her pacing/timing.  The only drawback?  her English!!!  A lot of words are mispronounced...'internal massage' sounds like ""internet message""...touch your 'ankles""/uncles, etc.  This being said, this DVD is really well done and I am sure that I will use it repeatedly.",1309651200,3,658,4.873873873873874
2735788,5,B000MGBLY6,"I have tried quite a few yoga workouts and this is my favorite.  It leaves me so relaxed, more flexible, and nothing is painful.
Her voice is soothing and interesting, and nobody in the video looks like a supermodel or acts all flirty.  Just peaceful, real people.  One thing I especially appreciate is this is not mostly plank, pushup and downward dog like many of the others I've tried.
Those left me with painful shoulders and arms, yet not enough workout everywhere else.  This is more balance, for me anyway.",1297209600,26,513,4.666666666666667
2735789,5,B000MGBLY6,"This 45 minute work out (there are two on the dvd) is really excellent. I like how Jenny Cornero uses some of the sanskrit terms for the poses and also explains how they are useful (i.e., great for the pituitary gland). Her accent, while thick, is easy to understand. I highly recommend this dvd.",1270425600,8,296,4.5
2735790,4,B000MGBLY6,"Jenny Corneo is very calming with a nice Spanish? accent which I had no problem with hearing clearly. This is done in a large industrialized space with concrete floors but beautiful simple mostly white walls, drapes & other simple decorations. There are 4 other students, all in different shapes & ethnics and 1 of them being a man. The production could be better, but the camera angles have artistic sweeping shots, zooms in, move around to different angles slowly throughout. The music is VERY light, almost don't hear it, but it's very soothing & beautiful.
Jenny has a relaxed style, she goes in/out of each pose with you, and then during helps fix other students postures. She tells the benefits of each pose as she helps other students. She usually has a relaxation after each pose for several seconds or so usually reclined, but sometimes child's pose. She only does the usual sun salutation poses at first, nowhere else. She has great body awareness and the session really flowed. The music is very light, almost don't notice it, but the session was healing.
Gastro-Intestinal: 55 min - She starts with alternate nostral breathing, lying down stretching, rocking on spine, sun salutations with crescents, laying down, alternate leg stretches, double & basic holding leg lifts with shoulders off the ground for ab strengthening, shoulder stand, plow, boat, bridge, fish, easy table, bow, triangle, warrior 1, cat/cow, single seated fwd bends, both leg sitting fwd bend, twisted sage pose, standing fwd bend & then relaxation.
Depression: 55 min -  starts the same as above with breathing, lying down, rocking spine, sun salutations, lying down, alternate leg stretches, double & basic holding leg lifts with shoulders off the ground for ab strengthening, boat, lay down, shoulder stand, plow, bridge, fish, single sitting fwd bend, cobra, cat/cow stretch, child's pose, sitting spinal twist, standing fwd bend, triangle, warrior 1, standing wide legged fwd bend & mediation for w/reclined lion's pose for 5 min w/her mostly still speaking & the music louder & beautiful.

someone said that on another disk of this series, they took the same class & just edited differently. I was mostly paying attention to workout, but upon replaying, they are right. but the music is still wonderful & the practice is still peaceful to me... I rented this.",1191801600,67,2348,5.064599483204135
2735791,5,B000MGBLY6,"I bought this set of dvd's for Gastro Intestinal/Depression a few weeks ago. They are absolutely amazing. The postures have really helped improve the chronic stomache problems which I have had for years.
I can't begin to say how thankful I am!!!!!!!!!
I recommend these dvd's to everyone, they will change your life.",1181779200,49,316,4.981132075471698
2735792,3,B000MGBLY6,Not my cup of tea.  I am too much of a beginner to gain the most from this video.  I would prefer more explanation and demonstration and I found the teacher/leader's accent to be distracting.,1474588800,,191,4.428571428571429
2735793,4,B000MGBLY6,This is really an amazing practice. I felt wonderful after. It would have gotten 5 stars in the cueing was better.,1474156800,,114,4.476190476190476
2735794,3,B000MGBLY6,Very basic (elementary) level!,1473638400,,30,6.75

2735797,5,B000MGBLY6,At first I was afraid I was not going to be able to understand the instructor due to her accent but I just followed along and was pleased many pose names were put on the screen. I felt calm yest invigorated after this program- very similar to how I have felt when taking a studio class. I also enjoyed that her video included other students in the class.,1472688000,,354,4.220588235294118
2735798,5,B000MGBLY6,Great session.,1471737600,,14,6.5

2735800,5,B000MGBLY6,"I practice Vinyasa and Iyengar style yoga and this is one of the best yoga videos that I discovered at Amazon. much better than many other more ""fit"" looking yoga videos. The teacher knows what she is doing. It ends abruptly with the corpse pose - a pose that most yoga classes will end with. Other than that very good, very challenging one hour yoga.",1470268800,,351,4.415384615384616
2735801,5,B000MGBLY6,"I really enjoyed this. While it was relaxing and low key I was sore the next day, slightly, from all the stretching. Her accent is soothing and it moved slow enough to catch on. I skipped the breathing parts in the beginning and went straight to the stretching. I have a long way to go flexibility wise and could not do the moves like they did but this is great for beginners to start and intermediate if you are already there.",1469577600,,427,4.283950617283951
2735802,4,B000MGBLY6,"The content of the video  is great- nice, relaxing, and easy  to  follow workout. I wish  the quality of the video (picture) was better. Otherwise,  I recommend this  video to the  people who's  digestive system  needs some extra help.",1469059200,,235,4.82051282051282
2735803,5,B000MGBLY6,"I absolutely love this video. The routine is not challenging for me (moderately in shape?)  But I can feel where I used my muscles all over my body for the next day or so. The routine is comprehensive, balanced, and moves at a perfect place.  What I really love is the meditative, serene quality of the video and the instructor's beautiful voice and accent. I feel completely renewed physically and mentally every time I do this.",1468713600,,429,4.631578947368421
2735804,5,B000MGBLY6,I loved her pace and the amount of time she gave for proper breathing. Completely enjoyed the hour!,1468368000,,99,4.555555555555555

2735807,5,B000MGBLY6,"Amazing video, I've been doing this routine for several years now. Really focused on yoga as a moving meditation. This routine always clears up the aches and pains in my back.",1464652800,,175,4.67741935483871
2735808,5,B000MGBLY6,Her voice is so relaxing!  Great video and even a beginner can do it with modifications.,1464566400,2,88,4.5

2735810,5,B000MGBLY6,I love this. I've been doing yoga along with Jenny on and off for about 5 yrs. really helped me get my body back after having baby.,1463097600,,131,3.888888888888889

2735813,5,B000MGBLY6,I love it!  It makes me feel so relaxed and it helps me to meditate as well.  I've done other yoga videos but their voices are not soothing.,1462320000,,140,3.9642857142857144
2735814,4,B000MGBLY6,Good video- very relaxing,1461715200,,25,5.5

2735816,5,B000MGBLY6,By the end of this you will be ready for bed. Love it. Haven't done it in a while but whenever I need to relax and destress or get my belly uncramped/get things moving this is a great go to. Her voice is so soothing to me.,1459900800,,222,3.74468085106383
2735817,5,B000MGBLY6,"I am probably not the best source for reviewing this as it is my first jump (no pun intended) into Yoga. That being said, as a 55 year old female who has recently been diagnosed with IBS-D, this was extremely relaxing and I look forward to it everyday. I have not been doing Yoga long enough to tell if there is a difference but since there has been so little relief with medication I feel like at least I am trying to do something positive for my health.",1457827200,,455,4.181818181818182
2735818,1,B000MGBLY6,"This video is terrible -- grainy and poor quality. The sound track starts out fine, but then it is out of sync with the rest of the video through to the end. I suffer from several gastro-intestinal issues (chronic nausea and vomiting, gastroparesis,  and what my GI doctor calls ""abdominal migraines""). I've done Tai Chi since 1998, and it really helped with my head migraines, and so I was really looking forward to a gastro-intestinal-focused yoga program that would be as helpful. Unfortunately this video falls far short of this.",1456963200,,533,4.9222222222222225
2735819,5,B000MGBLY6,"Great for beginners.  Lots of corpse pose and rest but the challenge is there.  She is a little hard to understand, but I got used to her voice.  Once I did it a couple of times, then I could just use her voice for direction and not have to look at the video.",1456617600,,259,3.849056603773585
2735820,4,B000MGBLY6,"This video gave the participant plenty of breathing and focusing time, The instructor clearly new what she was doing.",1454284800,,117,5.2105263157894735
2735821,5,B000MGBLY6,Works as described ... really great exercise!,1454112000,,45,5.571428571428571

2735823,5,B000MGBLY6,"Loved this sequence. Very sore legs the next day, kept moving for entire sequence, balanced routine w holding poses and moving. Good for intermediate level.",1453593600,,156,5.28
2735824,2,B000MGBLY6,I found it hard to follow.  Gave up on it.,1453593600,,42,3.2
2735825,5,B000MGBLY6,"I cannot believe how much better I feel! I suffer from major GI issues. From the get go, I could feel my core area charged and hot and helped my stomach feel great. Made me feel amazing ",1453507200,3,186,4.027027027027027
2735826,5,B000MGBLY6,Great pace,1453334400,,10,4.5
2735827,2,B000MGBLY6,"This is an advanced yoga routine as the poses they do look like they could only be performed by contortionist.  I would love to be at this level one day, but feel it's highly unlikely.  Skip this if you're just beginning yoga and looking for something that gets your body stretched and moving.",1451779200,,293,4.509433962264151
2735828,2,B000MGBLY6,"I was extremely unimpressed with this yoga video offering. The structure of the class with floor work at the beginning and large muscle standing poses towards the end deviates from the standard yoga class construct and makes little sense in terms of body mechanic flow. A section on abdominal work thrown in (towards the beginning again before larger muscle groups were engaged) was straight out of an old school standard exercise class (think crunches and double leg lifts) and not really yoga related. In addition, the instructor kept throwing in woo-woo pseudo medical claims of how a pose can be used to treat such and such medical condition or how yoga will cure all your ailments. Yoga is great but it's not a mystical, miracle cure-all, but that's OK because it can still be a great activity that helps you lead a healthy(ier) life. There's no need for mystical snake oil salesmanship and, to be frank, I find this type of speech to be highly unethical. There was very, very little that addressed gastrointestinal support (boat pose as shown on the cover image was one of the few poses in that arena) so the title is completely misleading. Definitely not for beginners. There are so many better yoga videos out there on Prime. Pass this one by and try another.",1451260800,,1267,4.763636363636364
2735829,5,B000MGBLY6,"So here's the deal... I just finished this video and got on my computer to write a review. Well, 10 minutes after savasana, I mean. 

This instructor is so good at this. The guidance is superb physically and mentally.

Someone in a previous review said something like, ""finally, a real yoga class"", and that is true. This is the best one I've ever seen on video and probably in an actual session.

I had surgery in my GI area, from neck to abdomen, and have issues. This relieved the issues. Having GI problems can leave you depressed and full of anxiety. This took care of it and can't wait to do it again.",1450137600,6,607,4.345132743362832
2735830,5,B000MGBLY6,Great yoga practice mentally and physically. At times more  intermediate poses such as plow pose.,1448150400,,97,5.466666666666667
2735831,5,B000MGBLY6,"Amazing dvd, clear instruction and very nice sequence. The instructor has a very good approach to yoga without being hokey about it.",1447113600,,132,5.045454545454546
2735832,5,B000MGBLY6,"Awesome class!  Challenging enough, but a slow and steady pace.",1447027200,,63,5.3
2735833,5,B000MGBLY6,Pace was slow allowing time to enjoy each pose,1445731200,,46,4.222222222222222
2735834,5,B000MGBLY6,"This is a great session. With Amazon prime I can watch it over and over, which works great for yoga. The more familiar I am with the routine, the less I have to look at the tv and the more I can stay in a meditative mindset.",1444953600,2,224,3.7872340425531914
2735835,5,B000MGBLY6,This is an awesome sequence. Absolutely loved it. Will use with my students. Can't wait.,1441843200,2,88,4.933333333333334
2735836,3,B000MGBLY6,"It's hard to hear/understand what the instructor is saying sometimes. As a yoga novice, I really need to be able to clearly hear the teacher's instructions so I'm not lying with my forehead on the floor for too long or constantly craning my neck at odd angles to watch what the others are doing.",1439856000,,295,4.481481481481482
2735837,3,B000MGBLY6,"This was just okay.  There are some really advanced moves in this video.  The lady is also a bit hard to understand at times, which made it more difficult to follow along than it should be.",1439510400,,189,4.222222222222222
2735838,5,B000MGBLY6,This video is EXACTLY the slower paced and deeper stretches I have searched high and low for --but never found on video. This video was my post pregnancy go to. It has SO helped with the physical transition from my pregnancy alignment back to my normal muscular state. Highly suggest!!! I wish JC would make a whole series of these... I would buy them all!,1438128000,3,356,4.492307692307692
2735839,2,B000MGBLY6,"Like the yoga moves, the woman is hard to understand. Too much time spent on breathing in my opinion. I fast foward that part and mute it and then its okay.",1437609600,,156,4.064516129032258
2735840,5,B000MGBLY6,I really liked this one.  I had a hard time finding a Yoga for beginners and for gastro issues.  This one was perfect.  Not to difficult and she continues to remind you to not push to hard if you're a beginner.,1437523200,2,210,4.073170731707317

2735843,5,B000MGBLY6,I absolutely LOVE Jenny's yoga session! Her voice is soothing and exercises seem to be just what I needed after the session is over. I always feel invigorated and calmed by her class.,1435276800,,183,4.575757575757576
2735844,3,B000MGBLY6,Excellent workout. The music is kind of depressing. That does not help.,1435276800,,71,5.0
2735845,3,B000MGBLY6,"An ok class for intermediate practitioners who know their limits and know poses more intricately.  She encourages the full pose with very little talk of minding your bodies limits, offering modifications or instruction on subtle parts of the postures. The mellow vibe is nice though.
I have neck issues and need to be careful with shoulder stand, plow and fish, which are  in this class. She also talks about burning fat around the abdomen which is triggering for me as I am recovering from body hatred  and an eating disorder and this kind of talk encourages body shaming.

Thankfully it is free on prime. I will look for another one to do when I feel like I need nice mellow class.",1433808000,,683,4.619834710743802
2735846,5,B000MGBLY6,Will be using this video again. I liked how the instructor focused on breath and awareness rather than tricks. Bonus for including normal looking people in the video (not just overly thin and perfect yogis).,1433289600,,207,4.942857142857143
2735847,5,B000MGBLY6,"I just finished this DVD and I feel better than I have in a long time. I haven't been feeling as well lately and haven't worked out for a while. I knew I needed to do something, and I didn't even plan on completing this, watching it on Amazon Prime, but for some reason I kept going and I'm really glad I did. I feel better than I have in a really long time. All the poses were gentle, but instantly relieved a lot of pain and pressure in my body.
I would definitely recommend this for anybody suffering from depression or stomach problems.",1431907200,3,540,4.201923076923077
2735848,5,B000MGBLY6,Been having tons of stomach issues spent thousands on doctors who can't find what's wrong. Started doing this video and I'm almost pain after months of sleepless nights from pain.,1430352000,,179,5.0

2735853,5,B000MGBLY6,This as close to being in a real yoga class as I could find. Great for when you are stressed,1427414400,,92,3.65
2735854,5,B000MGBLY6,This workout really does help with digestion. It also helps to improve your overall mood. It's gentle enough for all levels. I highly recommend it.,1426636800,,147,4.92
2735855,5,B000MGBLY6,"This video is great for my back. The instructor works your spine in every direction and I walk away feeling great. It's not a difficult sequence, so good for beginners too. Not much warrior, but you do work your legs a bit. Works your stomach pretty well. Also, she cracks me up when she says ""Relax your face"". It has become a running joke with my friends and family. Shavasana at the end is awesome, I have actually fallen asleep on my floor.",1426291200,,444,4.36144578313253

2735857,5,B000MGBLY6,This is an excellent video if you have some time to do yoga.  I love it.  Her voice is soothing and she goes through the pose and tells you how it helps you.  (That I love!)  I have a shorter one I do when I don't have much time but if I have time this is my pick.,1424822400,,264,3.5
2735858,4,B000MGBLY6,"Nice and relaxing.  If you're looking for a good stretch, this one is for you.  I specifically like the breathing exercise in the beginning because I find that if I jump into an intense yoga flow I don't follow my breath.  By disciplining my breath first, I feel like I was more aware throughout the session.  Pretty good for relaxation.  Look for something else if you want to sweat.",1424736000,2,384,4.507246376811594
2735859,4,B000MGBLY6,"First of all, I loved the instructor's accent. She didn't call the poses by the names I'm used to, but it all worked out. This was a low-key but intense yoga session. I enjoyed it.",1424476800,,180,4.171428571428572

2735862,5,B000MGBLY6,Wonderful video that includes a few challenging poses though keeps a very calm environment throughout. The instructor is knowledgable and professional. This series will be my new go to for yoga at home.,1424217600,,202,5.151515151515151
2735863,5,B000MGBLY6,"I have never been a fan of Yoga. I've tried a few classes in the past and it just never quite clicked. I do a lot of cardio and that's typically my preferred workout. However, I've been working 10 hour days, having gastro-intestinal issues and lately, I was feeling like my body needed a good stretch so I tried this on Amazon Prime. What an amazing Yoga instructor!! I'm hooked. I will be doing Yoga regularly. I love the way this instructor teaches, her soothing voice and the pace of the 60 min workout.

I like the fact that it's an entire hour. I like the fact that the instructor focuses on the thyroid and pituitary gland. I like the fact that she focuses on the spine. I feel like I am in an actual class. Her accent is super cute. The more I watch it, the more I find myself imitating her -""your es-pine is a-flexible!""  And at the end, she brings it all back to mind, body, and soul and reminds us that yoga is about these 3 things. Not just a firm butt! :)",1421798400,4,605,3.84
2735865,3,B000MGBLY6,"Ok...so I was thinking about purchasing this for a friend, but decided to check it out through Amazon Prime first.

Pros:

Nice and relaxing ('til the end, that is)
Instructor is not obnoxious or too woo-woo-mystical-acting
Poses and transitions seem doable for someone with not a lot of experience with yoga
Variations of the poses and movements were shown.

Cons:

Instructor was difficult to understand--partly due to her accent
Poor acoustics (far more of a problem than the accent).

Major Con (aka, What Ruined It):

The music playing during the Final Relaxation section.  WTF?  The music goes from being all soothing and relaxing to suddenly being so loud and discordant that I could barely hear the instructor.  It was very jarring and by the time the video ended, I was more tense than before I started watching (my ears *hurt*).  It was like listening to an extended version of the music from ""Psycho""--and coupled with the instructor walking off at the end, leaving the students in that resting pose (looking like they're dead), it was a very disturbing.

I would have actually purchased this for my friend if it wasn't for that awful music at the end.  Up to that point, the video overall seemed really good (which is why the 3 stars), but that ending is not something I could listen to again--and I certainly wouldn't expect a friend to have to listen to it.",1420329600,,1371,4.762711864406779
2735866,3,B000MGBLY6,"I am a total novice at yoga other than a few workouts at a gym (not a yoga studio) and videos here and there.  So, I can not speak to whether the yoga positions are the ones for gastrointestinal health or depression.  I tried it because, it looked like it could help with keeping me flexible and on that it delivers. I will likely workout with this video again.

As far as format, the music seemed overbearing when I simply watched the video but while actually doing the workout, I didn't notice the music at all.  I found the instructions easy to follow, the instructors accent clear (but i am used to hearing people with lots of different accents).  And, I am not into chanting which is incorporated into the first few minutes of the workout.

As for the workout, my only problem is in the first portion (approx 10 min) the positions require transitioning from standing to floor - something that is not quick or easy for me with knee pain.  After that section, the workout is mainly on the floor, lots of streching and a suprising amount of strenghtening (as opposed to streching) abdominal excercises.  I was actually a little sore the next day,",1418428800,2,1148,4.538834951456311

The sound quality is poor, and it's not always easy to understand/follow the instructor, even when I understand the poses basically. It also seems like some of the other folks on camera are doing modifications, but we're never told who or how we could use those modifications other than to just see them doing something and try to guess at it.

Here are my thoughts on the video.

1.) Best suited for someone with prior experience. However, a beginner can do it as long as you take time to watch the video and familiarize yourself with variations on the more advanced poses.
2.) The teacher does a good job of reminding you of breathing while moving through the poses.
3.) The practice is a slow, deliberate pace. The focus is on building muscle stability through holding poses. The pace gives you enough time to watch the pose, practice it and then rewind and continue (if needed).
4.) I didn't recognize & couldn't figure out one pose. It is towards the end of the practice. You are on your side, put your arms/hands together and roll onto your stomach with your hands underneath. After further research, I think it's a variation on locust pose. I didn't like her version, so I will use traditional locust pose instead.
5.) I practice yoga on a regular basis, but shoulder stand and plow pose are still a challenge for me. I suggest researching those poses first and learning the supported variation. Yoga Journal has good suggestions. [...]

Some people may have some trouble following this instructor's verbal instruction due to her accent, but I found it very relaxing and of the few words I had difficulty understanding, the pose name was up on the TV screen anyway and I also was able to get the jist of it from following the others performing the poses in the room on the video. The end results for me are a fantastic stretch into muscles that have been neglected since my last class six mts ago, and I feel as if my stomach is more settled as well. For a ""cherry on top"", I found this video to be highly relaxing and de-stressing. I highly recommend.",1371772800,,756,4.293706293706293

2735936,4,B000MGBLY6,"I'll start by saying that this is a genuine yoga session with a legitimate yogi. It flows smoothly, feels non competitive  (you're not trying to be a yoga gymnast) and I feel wonderful as a result of doing this video. The instructor is likeable and calm. The other participants in the class look healthy, fit, and like real people, not fitness models. For all these stated reasons I truly enjoy ""Yoga For Health- Depression/Gastro-Intestinal Disorders"".The approimately 1 hour session goes by quickly and I feel it attains it's goal of helping to alleviate depression/gastro-intestinal troubles. I'm a believer in the benefits of yoga and this video is an excellent example of how anyone can use the body the correct way to feel better.
I've saved my only complaint for last. It's a minor issue but I do have some trouble understanding the instructor because of her accent.

Also, it comes with two different options ""yoga for depression"" and ""gasto yoga"", it's pretty much the exact same 50 minute strech but jsut with one different move. thanks!",1365724800,,399,4.47945205479452
2735945,3,B000MGBLY6,"This seems like it would be an okay practice depending on what you are using it for.  The title caught my eye, because I think people who practice yoga are usually interested in their health, rather than just doing it for appearance.  I always watch a recorded program through once before following along and in this case I learned something interesting.  Not far into the yoga session the instructor has the students do a ""semi-inversion"" and mentions that this is not a recommended pose for those with high blood pressure.  She doesn't give an alternate pose for those people.  Since I have high blood pressure what would I do during this pose, which is held for quite a while?  I take yoga class regularly and know that inversions are not recommended for people with high blood pressure, but it seems odd that a health focused practice would include these poses and not offer a alternate pose for those who can't do them.  It seems like a fine video if you don't have that issue, and just to note, inversions (head down, body up-like a shoulder stand) are not dangerous, just not great for that one issue.",1365206400,3,1108,4.622448979591836

2735952,4,B000MGBLY6,"I have been practicing yoga for several years in the same studio with the same instructors. That being said I am not what anyone would consider overly skilled or flexible- not in any part due to my instructors but my unwillingness to incorporate yoga into my daily routine. I would only do postures in class. I thought I would do this video at home on the many days I do not go to a class.

I have done this routine several times now. I like that the instructor on the video uses postures that I do not normally do or that I have never done. I find the video to be nicely paced with a good mixture of working and resting poses. The video is a little more advanced than my skill level so it is a challenge.
The instructor has very good dialog but at times I find her difficult to understand. I agree with some of the other reviewers that comment on the fact that it does feel like you are in the class. I am going to continue to use the video as I believe it will increase my strength and flexibility.",1360800000,,1000,4.128205128205129

2735954,5,B000MGBLY6,"I am 53 year old relatively healthy woman, single working mom of  a 10 year old boy. As a youth and into my twenties I was an athlete; I had back surgery on L4 L5 S1 five years ago this week. I have recovered well but want to advance my physical condition beyond somewhat of a PT or maintenance post surgical place, but am quite cautious because of risks of further injury. During this video I was able to adapt the most intense poses based on her verbal guidance throughout to go as far as a i can comfortably. I was refreshed and relaxed after the video and look forward to increasing my strength and flexibility beyond where it is. Though I will never return to being a triathlete, I have hope I can regain that core strength I once had. One thing I might add is that during none of these exercises/poses did I experience pain, as I have in the past with some post injury physical therapy exercises. With the back, pain is a sign of unnecessary stress, so I have smeared clear of some medical advice regards exercise and have been searching for my own best routine; I do not ignore medical advice blatantly or irresponsibly, but I think that yoga will best help me own what is best for my body.",1358035200,5,1197,4.32
2735955,4,B000MGBLY6,"I love the diversity of the routine! It goes from sun salutations to plow and shoulder stand, to backbends and abdominal work, to triangle poses and lateral spine bends. However, I found her instruction to be lacking. For example, five breaths into shoulder stand, she goes, ""By the way, you shouldn't be doing this if you have high blood pressure..."" A little too late for that information, isn't it? Also, she does not properly explain how to go into shoulder stand. Unless you've done the pose before, it may be somewhat difficult to figure out what to do. Lastly, she doesn't always explicitly tell you to move into the new pose, so you have to keep an eye on the video.

In short, a great routine -- but don't rely on her instruction. Gain some familiarity with the poses before attempting them.",1357344000,3,800,4.633802816901408

2735957,3,B000MGBLY6,"I'm a relatively fit 31 year old male. I can do 10 pullups, run a 10K, etc...
However, my back is still hurting three days after doing the routine on this video! And I didn't even push myself. It really annoys me how all these yoga classes always throw in these stupid advanced exercises to try to kick your ass - in this case for example straight leg lifts. These are murder on the low back unless you already have a solid foundation on core strength.  And even if you are fit, there are many better, less risky exercises for the abs.

When I do Yoga, and especially when I seek out a Hatha/Gentle/YogaforHealth routine, I am not interested in working my abs or straining my back. If I wanted to do this I'd go to the gym and lift weights!
There are some other really crazy things in here as well, and I can't imagine the general population doing them without getting severely injured.

Aside from this, the presentation is OK. I do find the instructors accent a little distracting. She also says some annoying things like ""this is a great thing and will cure us of all ailments.""

I'm wanting balance in my life and something that is truly gentle and about encouraging better immunity, breathing and positive mood. But this DVD might not be it for me.",1356998400,5,1253,4.434782608695652

If you stick with the program though you will feel great at the end.  The instructor does a nice job of explaining the name and benefits of each pose, presenting the poses in an order that flows very well.  If you are not very limber/active, you may feel as though there is too much standing to laying to standing and so on.  The more serious yoga practicer will appreciate the variety of movement.

2735963,5,B000MGBLY6,"This is the best yoga ever!  I did this yoga at least twice a week when it streamed on Netflix.  I was heart broken when it was no longer available.  Not only does this yoga tone and stretch every single part of your body, but it relaxes and energizes you at the same time.  It's amazing.  On top of that, it really does promote digestive health.  It clears you out completely within 24 hrs, making you feel lighter and energetic.

The instructor has an accent and it did take me a couple of times to know some of the things she was saying, but I was always able to understand the next move.  Her voice (accent included) is so relaxing.  I can't recommend this yoga enough!!!!",1345161600,4,676,4.301587301587301
2735964,5,B000MGBLY6,"I can't tell you how annoying it is that so many ""yoga"" videos are just promoted and filmed as fad ""lose weight"" or ""get your butt toned"" or some other garbage that yoga is not actually about.  Finally, here we have a REAL yoga class taught by a very proficient teacher.  This is as close to being in a real studio with a great teacher as you can get at home.

This is yoga in it's basic, holistic, well-being-promoting form.  No gimmicks here, no attempted ""coolness"" or anything fake, just the real thing.  If you are able to do all of the exercises through to the end, you will feel an immediate, palpable boost to your circulation and wellness.  That said, I am about 40 or so pounds overweight and found it hard to sustain some of the poses because my belly got in my way; but I did do it all.  If you are over 60 pounds overweight, you may have a hard time achieving the poses, but even coming close will benefit you and daily practice will increase your flexibility and leanness.  The rhythm of the video is excellent, the repetitions deepen the poses, and the flow or order of poses works very well to lead into the next.  The instructor is one of the best on video ever.  She has an accent, and I'm 90% sure she is from Argentina (I'm Latin; I can tell), but I'm not sure why anyone would negatively comment on her accent.  She is clear and very eloquent throughout; her voice is relaxing and the music is non-distracting.  I really also appreciated that the people in the video were real people who were not all ""perfect"" synchronized yoga robots.  It was really like being in an actual class.

The program ends abruptly while in ""Shivasana"" or corpse pose (the most relaxing) so you can just linger there if you need to!  Very relaxing and yet invigorating at the same time.  I could feel my blood flowing and body tingling afterwards.

If like me you have Prime then you can do this video for free, then you're lucky!  I would buy it if it wasn't free after trying it out.  I plan to add this to my regular regimen.  Excellent program. I also recommend any kundalini video by Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa--she is the real deal too (she is an anglo-American; so no accent there if that tends to bother you for some weird reason).",1342569600,143,2231,4.381995133819951

I know because I did it a couple times a week at one point (I developed at least a 100% increase in flexibility w/decreased overall ""stiff"" pain from stress), and then only every now and then because I was slacking on my health in general. When I went back to do my video again (on netflix), it had been deleted from the selection! I guess Americans aren't doing enough Yoga, that's my preferred interpretation:) Anyways really happy to see it here. Oh, and after doing the shoulder stands pose, my spine feels two inches longer, all tingly like air got in between each vertabra. It feels so. so. so. GOOD!
