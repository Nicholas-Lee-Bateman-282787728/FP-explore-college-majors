8474666,4,B005IGVTEC,"This was another collection of lost works of Sean Weathers. Most of these aren't complete and are unedited, but was still worth having if your a Weathers fan. Don't expect too much of this, just remember who made it and leave it at that.",1411689600,,237,4.409090909090909
8474667,5,B005IGVTEC,"Far from some sort of masterpiece, but if you're an indie filmmaker or just want to see some of the pitfalls of indie filmmaking then this is a good watch. I wasn't too into all of the graphic sex, however the commentary by the director and producer was a strong highlight on this disc.",1394323200,,286,4.314814814814815
8474668,3,B005IGVTEC,"I'm always curious about ""unfinished"" works and, so, being somewhat familiar with his other films, I thought I'd check out this set of clips from Weathers' incomplete projects.

Since the DVD contains excerpts from these projects, I expected some introductions or commentary explaining the project, but I was not prepared for the constant cacophony they consider a commentary.

First of all, IT NEVER STOPS! The babbling goes on and on and on, with hardly an interruption.

Secondly, the commentary mutes all the scenes' dialogue and distracts from the onscreen action. Not that the dialogue is brilliant nor that the action contains more substance than a couple banging away for what seems like hours, but the whole point of this DVD (I thought) was to highlight the works themselves (not the filmmaker). Even with bad dialogue, bad directing and bad acting, I would still like to see and hear it, unobstructed by guys chatting about their fantasies.

Thirdly, much of the commentary sounds more like two guys watching a porn movie than a filmmaker discussing his work, unfinished or not. Sure, they include anecdotes about filming the scenes, but they never let the scenes speak for themselves.

Fourthly, and most significantly, THERE IS NO OPTION TO TURN THE COMMENTARY OFF! (At least, for the first project on the DVD.) I checked the root menu for special features, setup, audio options . . . but NOTHING. I even accessed the audio via my remote control, but there were no alternativee audio tracks listed.

I, finally, had to turn off the sound to my headphones and watch the scenes in utter silence. During the rather explicit sex scenes, they could have discussed whether or not the sex was real and how the actors felt about filming such long sensitive scenes. In fact, I turned the sound back on, out of curiosity, but the commentary continued its monotony.",1380240000,2,1867,4.929936305732484
