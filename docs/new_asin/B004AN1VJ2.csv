4310070,5,B004AN1VJ2,"Mike Church has once again captured the real story of this country's founding.  Authentic in every way, it is a film that has the capacity to enlighten the uninformed and convict those who fight for the cause of freedom in our nation.  This film is about Liberty from tyranny and it comes at a time when those waters have been made muddy by our Socialist leanings at virtually every level of government from Fed to local.  Buy this film and also, if you don't have it already ""The Spirit of '76.""",1306454400,2,496,4.428571428571429

I usually watch an entire movie, even if I'm not crazy about it. After all, some movies present me with a reason I wanted to stay to the end. I turned this off after about 15 minutes.

4310078,3,B004AN1VJ2,"It is always good to show the complexity of actual history--only that allows us to use history to help understand the actions of people today.  But the writer opens with an odd assault on Lincoln, Reagan, and society in general for allegedly putting a mistaken emphasis on ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"",  and ""all men are created equal"" in the Declaration of Independence.

The clash with Britain and the need to protect ourselves from British actions are well documented in the video, and this is what makes it worth watching.  But the writer seems determined to make the case that there was no idealistic interest in creating a new, better form of government for the benefit of its citizens.  To further that point, Jefferson is shown being interviewed late in life, and saying the point was independence, not to create something new.  In terms of the point of concensus among delegates in July 1776, that was probably true.

However it is not possible to read either the public articles or the private letter of the leaders and not see that they realized something new was being created.  This is as true of leaders considered moderate pragmatists (Adams, Hamilton, Jay, Washington, and sometimes Madison) as it is of those given to more ""revolutionary"" or utopian musings (Paine, Jefferson, and sometimes Madison).

The bottom line is that this is worth viewing despite it being centered around an odd argument.",1468713600,,1431,4.953974895397489

It starts out seeming to think almost no one knows the first line of the Declaration (""When in the course of human events...""), the jumps to Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address and seems to imply Lincoln is wrong that ""all men are created equal"" is part of the Declaration (or perhaps they just don't believe all men are created equal, I couldn't tell), and then jumps to Ronald Reagan's RNC 1980 convention acceptance speech . Then it jumps to ancient Thomas Jefferson being interviewed by a reporter on what Really happened. The rest of the film jumps back and forth repeatedly all over the Revolutionary period in an incoherent way, to make some point that only the filmmakers understand. Then the film end with end cards telling us that Patrick Henry was America's greatest orator and George Washington, because he declined to become our king, is the greatest American who ever lived.  If I had to guess why the filmmakers made this, it would be propaganda cherry-picking elements of our Revolutionary period to make modern-day militia followers feel like patriots, even though they are completely ignoring the meat of the Declaration of Independence, which spells out in detail the decades of peaceful actions taken to try to remedy the situation.

Seriously, watch ""John Adams"" instead, which is (at the time I write this) also available on Prime video.

Sure, the language is beyond him but, he got something out of it. He wants to learn more and that's what's important to me.

This is a well-balanced film, suitable for most ages and I recommend it to anyone, truly, interested in our country's true history. This movie is based on the audio documentary ""Road to Independence."" I recommend getting a copy of that, also. Mike Church's audios and videos are just too informative to pass up if you want truth instead of hype and half-truths.

An unbelievable DVD and I've just made it through the first DVD and have not made it to the second one.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone that has any interest in our Country. Our constitution is in so much trouble and it is imperative that our people know what transpired to get it where it is today. The blood and sweat, the tears and the anguish that they went through, some not wanting to go along with it and some that did. This is as close as we can get to their shoes without actually being in them.

Mike Church put together a great DVD. Mike you are indeed a great American Patriot and I am so glad that I found you this last year, but most of all very happy that my wife got this great DVD for me.

Thanks for everything that you have done, and all the work that you put into this eye opening DVD. God bless.

4310123,5,B004AN1VJ2,"The Road to Independence shows the behind-the-scenes story of American independence.  Mr. Church shows the precarious nature of this road.  We see how easily a United States of America could have been a dead end.  Lucky for us, this road was traveled by a few citizens brave enough to commit their ""lives, fortunes and sacred honor""  to the ""glorious cause"" of representative self-government.  These individuals paved the way for generations of free people to come.

The movie begins with the ragtag state of the Continental Army in 1776. What Mr. Church does well is to juxtapose the philosophical debate for independence with the pragmatic reality of George Washington's military campaigns.  We see that while an emerging Congress debated a declaration of independence with letters of correspondence, General Washington dealt with the untrained and undisciplined soldiers meant to defend this new-sought freedom.

The Founders have one thing in common -- an arrogant and out of touch monarchy over 3000 miles away.  At the very least, they demand the right to petition the Royal British government for redress of grievances.  But it is the hard-nosed few within the ranks of The Founders that demand not only redress, but freedom from the King himself.  We also learn that some Founders do not want independence -- they still believe in the British Colonial system --  or possibly, they believe that a break from the king is too risky.

As the movie unfolds, it is apparent that the Founders truly understand the monumental political break they are contemplating.  They are quite aware that such a system of self-governance has never been tried.  Their new government of self rule-- a government by the people -- a government in which the Citizen is Sovereign, as opposed to a King, is unique. For them, however, it is quite ""natural"" -- in terms of 18th century philosophy (Hobbes, Hume, Locke -- natural man theory etc.).  It is the fresh idea that man has rights inherent in his very nature, and these rights are , as Ben Franklin insists, self evident.

With the fervor for independence rising, we learn that the people needed a ""spark"" of consensus. This ""spark"" comes in the form of Thomas Payne.  Payne writes of the ""common sense"" of self-rule.  He rationally argues that, in the course of human history, man is his own property, and that which he makes from his own industry and labour is his own, not someone else's.  A distant King demanding that every business, every exchange of goods and every other life decision be made in accordance with the King's Will, is all- together unnatural.  With the publication of Common Sense , The Founders find the will of the people behind them.

The movie breaks again to Washington's campaigns and we see that the colonies are facing a numerically superior enemy.  Washington's ""true blue"" patriots face an uphill battle.  In the end, we know the patriots prevail, but more importantly we find that the road to independence was not only a difficult military accomplishment, but a political one as well. The Road to Independence  gives the viewer the historical conversations and intense debates that argue for this ""glorious cause.""  It exposes the philosophical and political difficulties that the different colonies or future States had in reaching a Union.

Mr. Church's movie comes at a time where many Americans may not have realized the important sacrifices that lead to a United States -- a difficult union that was reached by only agreeing on the most basic guarantees -- i.e. life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  These guarantees were (and are) sacred in the rational sense. They put the individual before the collective -- the individual before a King.  They come ""naturally"" from rational thought -- from one's common sense.  They guarantee free political speech, The Press, religious freedom, and The Rule of Law.  Mr. Church's unique approach expertly portrays the bravery required by the men and women that dared declare the citizen Sovereign and not a King.  They bound together against many odds to establish a government based upon the sacred rights of man, and not upon the deity of a King. We may soon find the need for brave citizens yet again.",1325635200,,4224,4.972934472934473
4310124,5,B004AN1VJ2,"Mike Church claims during his radio show that it takes 8 weeks of listening to understand his message about our founding generation.  I say spend 2 hours watching ""The Road to Independence"" and you will understand and appreciate Mike's passionate knowledge of this often misunderstood and clearly underappreciated chapter in our nation's history.  RTI is the animated story of the events that lead to the signing of the Declaration of independence.  It is a quality production from the openiing credits to the moving ending when parts of the Declaration are read to newly declared citizens of 1776 and in our current time.  Mike has truly succeeded in blending his amazing historical knowledge in a touching and moving film.  Thomas Jefferson serves as a quasi-narrator highlighting some of the more misinterprted meanings of and facts surrounding the Declaration including that it did not declare our ""rights"", it declared our ""independence"".  The musical score is wonderful and provides theatrical drama and tension in many powerful scenes including Patrick Henry's ""Give me Liberty or give me Death"" speech at St. John's Church in Virginia.  This scene gave me chills as the attendees one by one called out ""To arms"" following Henry's moving plea.  The cartoon character development in this film is a big improvement over Mike's last excellent movie, ""The Spirit of 76"".  While Mr. Church clearly did not have a ""Pixar"" budget, the animators were able to create easily recognizable Founders in brightly colored animation reminiscent of memorable cartoons of the 1970's.  The actors who provided the voices in the film are of high quality especially George Washington and Patrick Henry.  Mike includes several famous events including the Boston massacre, the Boston tea party, and the Battle of Bunker Hill.  He also provides a look into the writing of Thomas Paine's famous essay, ""Common Sense"" and its influence in convincing Americans to support ""succession"" from England.  A large part of the movie takes place in Independence Hall in Philadelphia during the Continental Congressional debates leading up to the signing of the declaration.  Mike highlights the reluctance held be several of the states including Pennsylvania with John Dickinson's attempt to make ammends with Britain.  I learned just how important Benjamin Franklin was in securing the desired ""unanimous"" vote declaring independence.  I learned that it was Richard Henry Lee that actually proposed the Declaration. I also learned how reluctant George Washington was in leading the continental army as well as Thomas Jefferson's soft spoken and humble nature.  In addition, Mike is able to include a few famous phrases like ""don't shoot til you see the whites of their eyes"".  Mike also tells the viewer how Jefferson's original text of the Declaration included a condemnation of slavery.  This was removed in an effort to get South Carolina to support the cause of freedom.  The ""Director's Edition"" is provided in excellent DTS surround sound. Background sound effects are clear and appropriate in this format.  Additional scenes edited out of the original version appear seamlessly in this edition and compliment Mike's first effort.  A second disc contains over four hours of extras including behind the scenes footage and ""making of"" shorts.  I especially enjoyed Mike's visit of Mount Vernon where he explained how he developed a scene in the film where Washington, Jefferson, Henry and Mason discuss Virginia's role in the plan for independence.  I strongly recommend this film to anyone interested in an accurate depiction of one of the most important events of our time.  This is Mike's theatrical version of ""The Red Pill"" (listen to the show on Sirius Patriot channel for an explanation) and would be an excellent gift of history or addition to anyone's film catalog.",1324512000,2,3851,5.243066884176183

He channels the Founders with FACT not opinion. I learned more about the history of this country in 6 months than I did in college (history major) about the founding. Everything I learned in school..was wrong. I challenged the statements that Mr. Church made..researched with dilligence..and stood corrected.

4310127,5,B004AN1VJ2,"An incredible piece work and well worthy of the praise it has already received. Though it's not Pixar, the animation is more than adequate to deliver the message. And the message is delivered in DTS audio putting you in the middle of history. Really, you get the feeling you are seated at a table in Philadelphia during the Lee resolution debates. Every scene envelops the viewer in a blanket of sound that is guaranteed not to disappoint. There is more history crammed into this film than I learned all through my school years. Not a single word or minute of time is wasted on fluff. I've watched the production twice now and I am still trying to digest all the information being presented. No doubt, I'll be watching it a third time. Every word, every conversation is important. If you're going to get up and leave the room for even a moment, pause the DVD or you're going to miss something that you didn't know. The purpose of the film is to inform and educate and it does this in spades. Sadly, after watching this film, you'll ask yourself, ""Where are these men today?"" Honestly, our founding fathers where giants among men, highly educated and selfless; men and women who risked EVERYTHING to deliver this country from tyranny. We don't have those kinds of leaders today because the youth of this nation have been robbed of their history and the truth by our educational system. You can reverse this trend.

The passion of the founders that is captured in this movie, during the debate scenes especially, really brings the history alive and reminds us of how courageous our founding fathers really were. I was fortunate to be taught the greatness and courage of our founders when I was young so I continue to hold deep admiration and respect for them as men, and for their convictions about liberty and freedom, but this movie has deepened my feelings even more. What a great accomplishment these men achieved; they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing there were 30,000 enemy troops just off shore and that all they had for an army was a small group of men who were ill-equipped for the challenge. If our history was taught by actually telling the stories (accurately) in a format like this movie there would be much more interest in our history among our young people. We are in dangerous territory as a nation because this history is being lost; if you have children please make it a point to watch this movie with them and use it to teach them the ""real"" story about the founding of ""These"" United States, as they were more accurately originally referred to, rather than ""The"" United States as we currently refer to our nation.

The animation is an older style of animation but I did not find it ""distracting"" as some others have written. What is not an older style, however, is the DTS sound track. The speech quality, musical score and sound effects are amazing to hear through a DTS equipped surround sound system!

This is the first production from Mike Church I have viewed but it will not be the last-the Spirit of '76 is next.",1323302400,,1728,4.643790849673203
4310129,5,B004AN1VJ2,This was an excellent movie for what is contained in the audio.  The animation was ok and not really why I purchased this title.  The history comes alive when viewing this because of the excellent voice talent and writing.,1323302400,,222,4.666666666666667
4310130,5,B004AN1VJ2,"Mike Church nails it with the directors addition of The Road to Independence. The added scenes, better detail in the animation is excellent. This movie taken from actual writings and documents acurrately tell the story of the Declaration of Independence.",1323302400,,254,5.375

4310132,5,B004AN1VJ2,Even though the animation is not Pixar quality I enjoyed this movie very much. Anyone interested in an accurate portrayal of the founding of our country should watch. I believe Mr. Church educates about the roles people most teachers do not mention to their classes played in the formation of this great country. I rate this a five star production and a must see for everyone. I asked my 21 year old son to watch this movie and now he is recommending it to all his freinds! What better testemonial could you ask for?,1317081600,,516,4.5
4310133,5,B004AN1VJ2,"Truly an enjoyable experience to watch that left me feeling like a child again in the second grade, when I was first introduced to this significant historical occurrence. A very low budget film but extremely and creatively  done in an easy to watch animation that was very convincing. The historical content leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence, with all those great characters involved in America's Revolution. Told in an inspiring tone giving all the important details with an excellent cast of voice actors, that really give each of their characters their proper respect due to them. I would recommend this for any patriot or any Social Studies or History teacher trying to inspire and educate their students. No doubt the film maker has poured his heart, knowledge and passion into this work of art.",1316131200,,827,4.992753623188406
4310134,5,B004AN1VJ2,Exceptional work Mr. Church.  I enjoyed every moment of the movie.  Will be a regular showing at our home.  July 4th or not.  Can't wait to share it with the rest of my family.,1315958400,,176,4.088235294117647

4310136,5,B004AN1VJ2,"Thomas Jefferson's original Declaration of Independence was a great gift, a document that will be discussed for centuries into the future in similar fashion as The Treaty of Arbroath and The Magna Carta.

This movie about the people and events that led 13 Crown colonies to reject Crown rule is a great gift from the mind of Mike Church, and I dare say there is no other living person who would have the knowledge, creativity, humor, dedication, talent and tenacity to reproduce those events in so engaging, accurate and instructive a presentation as this movie.

This DVD is a great gift for friends, neighbors, co-workers, people who have everything and anyone else for special occasions or any other time.  An accurate awareness of the personalities, reasons and events is a valuable gift to anyone anywhere on this planet in these tumultuous times.  This movie is not about how to create a revolution, it is about what happened when it became necessary to break from imperial abuse.

Secession from an overbearing, centralized government was a great gift in the years between 1774 and 1783.  It was earned by just a hair's breadth of great effort and great, good fortune.  This movie presents the spirit and many of the details of those efforts in a way that honors the people who don uniforms, train hard, and fight for the establishment of Liberty on this planet.",1313798400,,1369,4.849785407725322

4310139,2,B004AN1VJ2,"First, let's admit what most of us know but are afraid to say it- this is political propaganda. As a propaganda piece, it's excellent. Real history? Not so much. It glosses over a great many points on the Founders and what they believed with respect to religion, philosophy, church-state relations, democracy, and the place of financial institutions in a republic. It's a bit like hearing a sermon at a church with either a very conservative or very liberal pastor- you can pick and choose bits of the Bible to support one thing or another. The filmmakers are guilty of a similar crime with this film- they focus on the specific documents of the particular Founders that fit their narrative. In that sense, this film represents political correctness at its worst. That said, it's still fun to watch and is at least grounded in reality. It just chooses to toss out the large part of what we know about the early US of A and its founders in the name of political correctness.",1312934400,7,973,4.662790697674419
4310140,4,B004AN1VJ2,"I had my wife order this for Father's Day after listening to Mike Church's show advertising it for months.  I wasn't disappointed.  This movie (which I watched with me entire extended family as a history lesson) reminded me how much I need to revisit the TRUE history of our country.  I really enjoyed the story, knowing it was based on factual documents.  I took away one star from my review for the animation.  I've seen many reviews commenting on the ""stunning"" animation, but I found it to be anything but stunning (in a good way).  We live in a Pixar world, and if we try to use videos like this to reach the modern generation of kids, they will laugh in our faces.  Mr. Church, I know this is a budget issue (hopefully so many purchases of RTI will help!), and so I'm hoping that one day you will revisit this work and make it live action or better animation.  Also, could someone please explain the butt-goosing scene?  Overall, I loved the history lesson!  Thanks, Mike Church!",1312502400,2,985,4.5141242937853105
4310141,5,B004AN1VJ2,Every American should watch this video. Thanks for a wonderful job Mike Church. A copy should be sent to every Congressman and Senator with hopes that they might understand how this country is supposed to work.,1312329600,,210,4.861111111111111
4310142,5,B004AN1VJ2,I own all of mike's films and documentories and this was as good as the rest. This film is accurate to the actual history of the event. If your intrested in learning the real history of the founding I suggest buying a copy.,1312243200,,223,4.209302325581396
4310143,5,B004AN1VJ2,This movie was a very easy lesson on how America declared it's independence.  It dared to explore the true motives and thinking of our founding fathers by their own writings. A must see!,1312156800,,186,4.636363636363637
4310144,5,B004AN1VJ2,"With timeless research, using the journals and letters of the ACTUAL Founding Fathers, Mr. Mike Church has academically detailed what so few of us have been taught, let alone been able to forget.  Our country's true founding has rarely, if ever, been told with such a tenacity to history, building of characters that we believe we know, and such a span of events leading up to our Independence.

I was afraid that with my loss of history, I would be confused with the jockeying of events presented in the film, as it went to and fro from one integral moment in history to another.  In fact, this drew me in more than anything, as each new scene weaved these great men together, and showed their struggles as the uncertainty of this great country teetered into hopelessness.  Nothing was certain, in fact, to the contrary, it was all but a foregone conclusion that their attempts would fail.  But by exploring events from Ben Franklin's trial in England, to Patrick Henry's speech at St. John's Church, to the Articles of Confederation, we see more than just a Tea Party, Lexington and Concord, and a gathering of gentlemen signing a parchment, that our school books tell.  The way that the film uses events after 1776, and interjects common questions, answered by Mr. Jefferson in later years, with answers that are accurate, and more often than not what you think, is fantastic and hits home how little we have been taught of the beginning of our nation.

The character development is great.  You really get to see the contrast of statesmen and how their inability to always get along actually propelled the Declaration to come to pass.  All of the dynamics of the various Founders is explored as they interacted and found themselves on this journey, and even how it impacted their lives and families.  The genius of the writing is evident as the story draws you in by using the true history that will seem so fresh to most viewers as if seeing it with brand new eyes.

It is a must have for all Americans, no matter your degree of history ""knowledge"" as even the history buffs will draw more from it than hoping for due to its accuracy.  For parents, it is an entertaining way to teach kids the true Founding and open up discussion that they can baffle their teachers with.  The film is beautifully done from the rendering and drawings (the people that talk about loving animation, but only that from the past 5 years, really need to do as with this movie and appreciate the past to understand the present), to the music that accentuates throughout, to the voices of all the actors.

Thank you, Mr. Church, for putting your heart and soul and knowledge into such a great piece that can be appreciated from the young to the old and can teach us all what America was, and what it can be again.",1311811200,,2793,4.604838709677419
4310145,2,B004AN1VJ2,"I heard the inspired audio of this film on July 4th this year on XM radio.

I was moved to purchase the DVD, especially after reading so many ""rave"" reviews. Unfortunately I will depart from the rave reviews and comment that the animation in this film is just awful. I admit it, I am a big fan of great animation, and have been spoiled by Pixar, and other first class animation.

I realize that this film is not about the animation but the extremely important historic content. My review does not take away from that part. The audio is fine too. I just found myself wishing I could turn off the visually distracting one dimensional characters to at least enjoy the message. I actually hoped to inspire my 15 year old son with this film, but we ended up chuckling at what he called the ""bobble heads."" Okay, enough. I know the intentions and efforts of the producer and his crew were sincere and I do not wish to make light of the effort.

This film does teach, and thank you Mike Church, and your crew, for your efforts. I hope some fine well-healed patriot comes along and makes a great and generous contribution to your company so you can hire some better animators, because the content is so important and so deserves the best production available.",1311638400,31,1251,4.502202643171806
4310146,5,B004AN1VJ2,"Perhaps when I was in elementary school this struggle for independence was taught, however, since becoming an adult I never hear about it anymore.  The founders have been hijacked by groups who do not value liberty anymore it seems, and the founders ideals and words have been twisted to fit what our progressive society interprets them to be.  We did not become the most prosperous nation in the world by embracing what our leaders are feeding us today, and this movie describes, using the actual debates of that time period, that not all of our founders agreed with a loose republic of states that was independent of the motherland.  Today's fans of centralized government can learn much from the debates of these men and realize we got to where we are now because of freedom.  Mr. Church is to be appreciated for presenting our ""Road to Independence"" with such fervor and scholarly research.",1311552000,,894,4.823529411764706
4310147,5,B004AN1VJ2,"We citizens of these fifty States are now enduring the same kind of tyranny from a distant, all-powerful, and arrogant central government that caused the original thirteen States to secede from Great Britain. The tyranny is now executed by the cancerous growth of unelected and uncontrollable ""czars"", agencies and departments such as EPA, HUD, DOE, ... etc. The tyranny grows with every dollar stolen from taxpayers and spent to modify and control their behavior, rather than to secure their liberty by protecting them from plunder.

Mike Church's ""Road to Independence"" shows us what impelled the Founders to pledge their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to the ""glorious cause"" (as G. Washington put it) of freeing the States from the tyranny of the British government, The production vividly depicts the physical and intellectual conflicts they faced and overcame.

""Road to Independence""  strikes a needed blow against the pervasive ignorance and ""politically-correct"" distortions that have been eroding our capacity for self-government for far too many generations, Those distortions have been, and are being, perpetrated by government-controlled public ""education"" and popular media, who seem bent on promoting government power while denying individual liberty and the concomitant personal responsibility.

I hope Mike Church's ""Road to Independence"" will someday be found in every library and elementary school. I hope it (or a future live-action edition) will be broadcast everywhere during Independence Day celebrations--- just like Dickens' ""Carol"" is broadcast everywhere during Christmas.

The whole story of our declaration in a easy to follow and nicely animated movie. I enjoy history but have a hard time with dates and putting timelines in order. This movie plays it out perfectly!

4310149,3,B004AN1VJ2,"I listen to Mike Church every day on the way to work.  After hearing some of the audio trailers he promoted, I could imagine Jay Thomas in a white curly wig and doing what needed to be done to declare this nation's independence, and couldn't wait to see it.  So I ordered the movie and at first was confused by the animated intro.  Then I realized it was the intro and figured, ""OK, the intro was animated and the rest of it will be ""real acting"".""  Wrong.  The ENTIRE movie is animated.  Yes the content is good, and Mr. Church conveys the emotions and little known personal struggles of what actually happened.  I'm not knocking that he actually conveyed history.  I cannot discount the amount of historical research he had to have performed to get this right.  And while it is intriguing, it's a cartoon.  The entire movie is a cartoon.  I give that to being ""low budget"".  You simply can't make a movie with actual scenes and actors without a multi-million dollar budget to start.  That is not Mike's fault.  He does a great job of communicating Constitutional history - and much of it is not known based on what kids are taught in school today.  But I give this 3 stars because he never advertised it as an animation.  Granted, had he done that, I may not have purchased it.  But it has 5 stars on Amazon now so I think that whoever has purchased this may worship at the feet of Mr. Church and the animation doesn't matter.  The message is sent and the content is what's important.  This review does not criticize the content - it is spot on.  And I learned many things watching the movie.  But I give this a lower star rating because of the deception of the advertising.  I just wish I would have known what to expect.",1310860800,4,1724,4.389240506329114

This movie was real animation and although it isn't Pixar or Disney quality, the animation is still good.  Remember that this entire movie was done with a budget that was a fraction of any animated movie out there.  The storyline is great and shows what our founders had to put up with in their fight for independence as well as what brought them to the point that they were willing to risk losing everything just to live as free men.",1310601600,,571,4.2592592592592595

The RTI shows the struggle, yes, struggle that our founders faced when trying to urge others that the time to break from British rule was necessary. After watching RTI I wonder if George Mason, Patrick Henry, and the others would have gone through the hell they did, if they knew in just a few short years this would all be for nothing, that we have chosen big government over liberty. Mike Church has nailed it with RTI and if you have an ounce of liberty beating in your heart, this movie will become an over powering force that speak to that very beat. RTI shows that these men were nothing but men, but they were men that refused to be governed by imperial rule. Today, all we have is a one party system that reminds me of the WWE. The two sides argue on how to centrally plan our lives in the house chambers, then laugh and yuck it up behind closed doors. Back then our country had a Thomas Paine that gave a spark to the colonies with common sense, Will Mike Church's Road to Independence be the spark that lights the fuse of Liberty and Independence with us today?",1310601600,,1320,4.391836734693878

I think this movie should be used in all classrooms as a supplement to the text books.  Great job and you can tell there was a lot of hard work put into this film.  As for the naysayers about the animation, well, you try animation; trickier than you think.

Mike Church really brings this story alive as he has done in his previous film and audio docu-dramas.

Every American should watch this, specifically teachers in US history classes around the country should show this to their students as required course work.

It is a little hard to follow because it covers many different events so I would suggest watching it more than once.  Mike Church uses primary sources to make sure that the information is accurate and that it truly reflects who the people were.  You won't see the larger than life figures that we are used to seeing, but see these people as the flawed humans that they really were.

General Greene cowering in fear of Martha Washington. Finally, the ""light bulb"" moment Franklin had while in London.

This movie should be mandatory education for all schools including college, Congress, the President and the Judiciary, if only we could get the ""mainstream"" media to watch they might learn and not make things up.

Great Job Mike, keep them coming.

4310169,5,B004AN1VJ2,"If you want historical accuracy, this is your film.  I saw another review blasting the film for poor animation and cost.  I disagree with that review.  I thought the animation was very good.  If you are going to compare the animation to a multi-million dollar Pixar/Disney production, you might be let down.  But, you're comparing apples to oranges.  This is not CGI animation for one.  Two, the pockets of Founding Father Films is not as deep as Hollywood.  It's an independent film. Since it's an independent film and isn't played in the usual theatres, the cost of its production is passed on to us, the consumer.  So, you aren't going to find the film for $15 at your local Wal-Mart.  By the time films hit Wal-Mart, they've already made most of their money at the box office, recovered their investment, and DVD sales is just the icing on the cake.  There was no box office sales for Road to Independence.  It was only released on DVD.  Someone has to pay for the production of the movie...and that is us.  If you enjoy history, the story of the founding of our nation, and the story of our founding fathers, I think you'll enjoy the film.  Mike Church has done the research for you.  You'd spend a lot more than $30 buying the research material and a whole lot more time digging through them to learn what you'll learn here during a viewing of this film.",1309737600,,1360,4.512295081967213

Every American should know this story the way it is told in this DVD, not one sided or biased to one outlook or another.

Mr. Church has done all the leg work so the viewer can just sit and learn.  If you are expecting a big CGI animated feature the animation will not be for you, this animation will remind you of the old School House Rock on Saturday morning TV in the 70s and early 80s.

4310184,5,B004AN1VJ2,"Church, like he does each and every morning on Sirius/XM Patriot, brings to life the relevance of the founding fathers in a unique and crystal clear way.  Rather than review the actual content of the movie, which the other reviewers have done already, I wanted to remark on the animation, which was superb.

Making a historical documentary using animation is no easy task.  To be able to get the viewer to lose sight of the fact that he's not watching real actors is a tough obstacle to overcome, but Church and his crew did a magnificent job.  Only minutes into it, I didn't feel like I was watching a cartoon.  The dialogue and smoothness of the animation were so well done that I felt like I was watching actors.

I haven't seen either of Church's other two docs, but after watching The Road, I'm going to devote the weekend to the others.",1309305600,,842,4.506578947368421

Although the characters don't move like they would in a Disney/Pixar film they are colorfully animated.  You really get to know the personalities of our forefathers - something you won't enjoy in a dry, public school history lesson.  Plus, it's historically accurate - another thing you won't get from your local state indoctrination institution.

If more people were aware of and appreciated what our forefathers stood for then America would be a lot closer to realizing its full potential.  This film teaches that lesson!  Buy it!",1309219200,,633,5.038461538461538

Although you can only put so much in a couple of hours, he has hit the pertinent points. Some have pointed out the non-pixar type animation, but since Hollywood seems to be bent on producing revisionist history it takes a bold man such as Mr Church to put up his own honor, fortunes, and years of his life to give us this masterpiece.

4310191,5,B004AN1VJ2,"In the latest movie produced by Mike Church, ""The Road to Independence-The Movie"", I have found that he has out done himself in making this movie.  I know it took long hard hours, and it shows. This movie gives me more inspiration than any other to do more for our Country than to sit on my butt and complain! The movie has the most accurate history about our hard beginnings as British Colonies, and how they wanted to become an Independent Nation of Individual ""States"", but many were very afraid to cut the ties that bound Britain and the Colonies.  The many usurpation's that the British had incurred onto the Colonies over many years had lead to frustration and fear of loosing the same independence they sought in leaving England in the first place.  Our Country is now in a similar situation, and to tell you the truth, much worse than they had it, but many of our countrymen don't realize it.  Mike not only has given us the history that has been lost throughout the centuries, but he has also shown us the many different feelings and thoughts that were present in our early countrymen.  The fear of separating from their ""Mother-land"", the fear of further oppression from the British and possible death if they were to loose their fight against them.  Each man that signed the Declaration was putting his life, his family's life and his property at stake, but yet they still had the courage to sign it.  It is in today's delima that we are also faced with fear of what will happen if we do nothing, let alone the fear of what will happen if we do something and fail.  If you want to see a movie done in the likes of Pixar, then see a movie made by Pixar, if you want to see a movie that will give you the knowledge of our Country's beginnings, and of what our Founding Father's had to endure, then this is the movie for you.  It is a very well orchestrated movie and I feel that Mr. Church has outdone himself once again, Bravo Mr. Church, Bravo!!",1309046400,4,1956,4.411111111111111

No other single source goes into the details of this time period.  Few of these are discussed in school.  IT discusses the trials and tribulations that the founders of this country underwent to convince that there was a need for independence, and the steps taken to create a new republic of states.

Additionally, it shows how just a single generation after the sacrifices of these great men and women, history was already changing and being misunderstood.  The debates brought to life in this movie are engaging, and thought provoking.  Few realize how much arguing and debating actually took place.  People had to be convinced that independence is what was needed.  This is different from the tone in school that everyone agreed that it was time for independence.  This is not a glossed over version of history.

4310205,5,B004AN1VJ2,"This is a tremendous film depicting the title: ""The Road to Independence."" It portrays the dissent between the various people in leading to the create of the Constitution and the wisdom behind its creation.

Given the way our children are ""educated"" in this day in age, this film is an eye opener for them. Talk about stimulating the brain cells of children (and adults) after years of listening to current politicians saying the Constitution is outdated, irrelevant ... or just plain ignored. Watch this film to develop a greater understanding (or refresh your memory) as to WHY we the Constitution wa created in the first place.

One of my children (an economics major in college) thought, at first, that animation (rather than having Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Will Ferrell acting) would be off-putting. It turned out that he loved it and it generated some great household discussions!

And thank goodness the writer and producer didn't take the Hollywood route. In its current form, the film concentrates on the subject matter rather than having the Hollywood model of picking Wesley Snipes, George Clooney or Tom Cruise as John Adams. Or ""Written and Directed by Michael Moore.""

I highly, highly recommend this film.

For example, Mike Church shows that secession in 74',75', and the early parts of 76' was off the table among the founders as 2/3 of the nation was either opposed to or not supportive of the idea of independence. The movie accurately shows the legitimacy of the loyalist and colonist cause by showing the debates in Congress among those like Dickinson who were stubborn on their viewpoint. Most importantly, this movie touches on something that NO OTHER movie on the founders touches-the legitamacy of war. The founders were deeply steeped in the writings of just war theorists like Augustine and Aquinas, and many agreed with these writers that war should be justified and carried out proportionally. Knowing this, the founders, by 76' knew the British military was coming and dicussed the merits of fighting the most powerful military in the world at the time. All the founders asked the questions, ""Do the benefits of fighting a war outweigh the negatives."" ""Will we be fighting this for the right purposes or are we only fighting this for political reasons."" ""Is this a justified war if we don't even have the chance of sucess."" RTI simply is a must have in every American shelf.",1307577600,5,1586,4.834558823529412

4310241,5,B004AN1VJ2,"Mike Church and his Founding Father Film Crew and Cast have done a wonderful job of telling the story of our founding  in a way that nobody has. The animation was superb and I felt that it helped to make me feel like I was actually in the room! Knowing that the story was taken directly from the transcripts of the times goes against all we have been taught in our liberally biased school system and gives us the opportunity to understand that Independence was not easy and most people did not think it was proper to revolt against the King. To learn the truth was exciting , but also hurts the heart to think what these brave men and women went through and gave up to give us this wonderful and free country. Thanks Mike,  looking forward to the next lesson!  By the way,  ours is #18!!",1307491200,3,787,4.297297297297297

First of all, the animation was nicely done, and the content was put together in a way that is easy for all ages to understand and appreciate. Secondly, this movie showed me the tremendous struggle our founding fathers went through during the process of gaining independence; something I was never taught in ANY History class. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone wanting to learn more about this countries struggle for independence. This would also be an excellent teaching tool for anyone with young children.  A must have for any history buff.",1307404800,2,679,4.904347826086957

So many myths that we have been taught about our founders. Patrick Henry's ""Give me Liberty... or give me death"" speech gave me chill bumps. Just to think about the certain punishment (death) these men knew would come if they lost, is astounding. Also well worth noting is the influence the women (wives) had on these infamous men. They wouldn't be known for who they are if it weren't for them. (favorite scene is when Adams said, ""Make-it-up-as-you-go-along Act""... Laughed. Out. Loud!)  5 Stars, Mike Church. :)",1307145600,4,648,4.684210526315789

The Road to Independence was not only able to hold my attention and interest but the kids enjoyed and learned as well.

  As a parent who supplements his children's public school work at home, The road to Independence is a perfect way to help my children learn history in fun and entertaining way. This DVD is perfect for Home School parents.

  Also, many of us adults lack a real understanding of the founding of this great nation. Mike Church in all of his work and especially here, gives us adults an education that will enable to carry on the torch of freedom and liberty. Without a foundation, knowing where we came from, how could we know where we the country should be heading.

  Get this DVD and while your at it pick up other Mike Church CDs and DVDs.",1306972800,2,931,4.520958083832335
4310246,5,B004AN1VJ2,"The Road to Independence
Mike Church's new movie is his best

History is animated by those who tell the story.  Who better to tell the story of American independence than Thomas Jefferson.  Mike Church's new movie entertains and educates with the most historically accurate portrayal of events leading up to July 4, 1776.  Through the eyes of Thomas Jefferson the story of The Road to Independence is told to newspaper publisher Thomas Ritchie on July 4, 1821.  Thomas Jefferson makes it very clear in the opening scene; ""mission [Declaration of Independence] no, no ... we declared independence"".  Thomas Jefferson debunks historical myth and educates the viewer the steps taken to achieve American independence.

Mike Church's film debunks historical fantasy surrounding the struggle for American independence.  It puts the facts on the screen through the voices of those great men that engaged in the struggle.  The viewer is transported back in history to learn the story of the Hutchinson Papers by Benjamin Franklin, the plight of the Continental Army by George Washington, and to that early day in June 1776 when a great Virginian Richard Henry Lee suggested that the American colonies declare independence.

This is history as history should be told.  This movie peeks into the minds of our Founding Fathers and explores the common sense solution they were forced to implement. The Road to Independence concludes on July 4, 1776 with these words;

""When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.""  - Preamble Declaration of Independence

Independence in the 18th Century was uniquely American and Mike Church's movie The Road to Independence is unique to another generation in the 21st Century.",1306886400,3,2060,5.11044776119403
4310247,5,B004AN1VJ2,"The animation was artful, and the script succeeds at creating identifiable characters out of historical transcripts and letters. Mike Church's Road to Independence (The Movie) beautifully captures the passion, peril, and gravity of the pre-Declaration of Independence era. I can hardly wait to show the film to my sons.",1306800000,2,319,5.530612244897959
4310248,5,B004AN1VJ2,"This movie is an excellent piece of work.  The story is intriguing and you hear about these people who you've never read about in your history class.  Everyone knows Thomas Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, and Paine, but you don't hear about the many people that had an opposing view to this revolutionary idea to separate from the British Empire and form their own country. There a couple of scenes where you're just caught up in what's going on that you get emotional because you feel like you're re-living Patrick Henry's speech at the Virginia House of Burgesses or watching the scene where the final vote to ratify the Declaration of Independence and just how close the revolution was lost or how until the final hour no one knew that the declaration would receive the unanimous support it needed.  Great job to Mike Church and the many people that helped make this movie a reality.  I know at least my 2 kids will be watching this movie someday!",1306627200,3,951,4.710843373493976

The cartoon-like characters are static and only their mouths move and that motion has nothing to do with the spoken words. Fifty-five years ago, when I was in elementary school, my teachers used a flannel-covered board and flannel-backed paper dolls to illustrate stories. This production was not as good as the flannel board stories of my childhood. Please don't waste time on this show. Amazon, please don't waste our time by listing this type of show.
