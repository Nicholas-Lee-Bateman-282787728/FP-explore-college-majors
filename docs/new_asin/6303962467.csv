749278,3,6303962467,"I went to see 'Surf Ninjas' on a free pass when it first came out on the big screen. For a free movie, it wasn't half-bad! I found it to be one of those kinda-dumb-yet-funny popcorn flicks. The many silly '3 Ninjas meet 3 Stooges'-style martial arts scenes, and corny one-liners & banter had me both laughing and groaning throughout the movie's run! Seeing Rob Schneider outside of his 'Rich-meister making copies' gig on SNL was... well... not that big a deal, really (I'm sure he was happy to get away from that character for a while). And Ernie Reyes, Jr's skills had improved quite a bit since I last saw him in 'Red Sonja' and the short-lived 'SideKicks' TV show. And where would a silly comedy flick be without the deadpan demeanor of Leslie Nielsen as the evil head honcho? Put 'em all together, and-- well, you'll just have to see it for yourself. All I'll say is, if you liked '3 Ninjas' or any of their sequels, I believe you'll find 'Surf Ninjas' even more fun to watch!

749279,5,6303962467,i think this movie is one of the best i have ever seen.it has something for everything. the action the destruction and curnal chee makes it work. it's the best.,996278400,3,160,4.366666666666666
749280,5,6303962467,"First impressions are deceptive. You might think this movie, at best, a diversion suitable for a bored 13-year old on a Saturday afternoon. You are in for a shock. Surf Ninjas is one of the funniest flicks to come out of Hollywood in the past decade. Johnny (Ernie Reyes, Jr.) and Adam (Nicolas Cowan) are two Asian-American surfer dudes growing up with foster dad Mac (John Karlen), literally on the beach in southern California. School is a bore (Director Neal Israel does an amusing cameo as their hopelessly out-of-it principal). All that matters to them is riding the next wave, until a gang of camouflage-clad killer ninjas shows up to assassinate them. Of course, the ninjas were sent by Colonel Chi (Leslie Nielsen), so although they look like Delta Force, they fight more like Keystone Kops. The squad of ninjas bumbling around southern California stick out like so many sore thumbs. ""Gee, those camouflage uniforms sure give them an uncanny ability to blend chameleon-like into their surroundings,"" observes Rob Schneider, in an hilarious turn as Iggy, Johnny and Adam's surfing-challenged classmate.
Chi overthrew Johnny and Adam's biological father, the king of Patusan, many years earlier, and now seeks to murder the two princes. Upon learning of their destiny from the mysterious, one-eyed Zatch (Ernie Reyes, Sr.), the boys return to Patusan to overthrow Chi and claim their throne. Johnny discovers love and his warrior heritage. Adam learns he is a seer, who can fortell the future (by peering into the screen of his Sega Game Gear.)
Reyes, Jr., is more than just an accomplished martial artist and owner of some of the best upper-body musculature ever captured on film. He also gives a performance full of charm, romance, innocence, youthful exuberance, and a delightful gift for physical comedy. He does many of the kung fu scenes in a state of bewilderment, as his moves are directed by his warrior ancestors. (This is surely a lot harder than it looks.) Cowan's comic timing is impeccable. (When Zatch informs him that a certain remote jungle village is the home of a great holy man, Adam deadpans, ""Wow, then I gotta get a T-shirt."")
Schneider is memorable as Iggy, the comic sidekick, commenting drolly on the proceedings (""The Mee Grob Hilton, serving strange things in shells since 1207."") and insisting, hilariously, that it is acutally he, and not Johnny, who is the deposed prince imbued with supernatural powers. It is refreshing to see a film where the Asian guy is the romantic lead and the white guy is the sidekick. (This was years before Shanghai Noon, remember.)
Tone Loc adds another comic dimension as Lieutenant Spence, an LAPD detective who follows the boys to Patusan. When knocked to the ground and surrounded by Patusani soldiers wielding automatic weapons, the unarmed Loc gamely displays his badge and says, ""LAPD! Freeze, punks!!"" It gets him nowhere, but give him 10 out of 10 for chutzpah. Reyes, Sr., as Zatch, the one-eyed, deadly serious Patusani royalist, evokes laughter by his stony-faced refusal to be amused by the absurdity of the proceedings. (The Zatch-eye view through a pair of binoculars is one of the film's best visual jokes.)
The main players are not only amusing as individuals, but play off against each other with some hilarious ensemble work, such as the bit where our heroes are captured by and escape from Chi's soldiers, and the unforgettable ""Money can't buy knives"" sequence.
Unfortunately, the one sour comic note is the miscasting of Nielsen as Colonel Chi. Nielsen does his best Frank Drebben, but he's just too darn lovable to accept as a ruthless Third World dictator.
In spite of this one shortcoming, Surf Ninjas maintains a deft comic balance as it rides wave after wave of comic invention. And you will never again hear the Beach Boys' classic ""Barbara Ann"" in the same way. Okay, so you don't have to tell the whole world you bought a movie called Surf Ninjas. Just get it, watch it in private, but make sure no one's close enough to hear you laughing. And when you're finished, lock it away in a strongbox labeled ""Guilty Pleasures.""",993513600,34,4118,4.935158501440922
749281,5,6303962467,"""Oh, there's something money can't buy...knives."" Brilliant! Neil Israel has outdone himself this time. Sure, Bachelor Party was good, and sure, you can't really compete with the Wonder Years, but man oh man oh man. This movie tops them all. Starting out with the expertly done car surfing scene, to the subtle, ironic brilliance of Rob Schneider's surfing skills this movie packs it in like no other. I believe that this movie will go down in history like such cult classics as Howard the Duck, and Hudson Hawk. Truly this cinematic masterpiece has not gotten the recognition it deserves. John Karlen excells as Mac, the lovable but strict father, and the return of Zatch sends a chill up my spine every time I see it. Adam's continual jokes with the game gear keep me rolling in the aisles, and the chop sticks literally sent Pepsi through my nose. Tone Loc brings a spark of soul to the screen with his new-age, sophisticated humor, and keeps the action alive on the lull of the boat scene with his hilarious delivery of the unforgettable line ""I swallow it every Tuesday."" Leslie Nielson proves once again why we have all so graciously let him into our homes and our hearts, with his honest portrayal of Colonol Chi, truly a statement torwards the attitude of international terrorists everywhere. The only thing this movie is lacking might possibly be a bit more surfing, although I did enjoy the homemade, Patu Sani surfboards, inspired once again by another one of Adam's incredibly realistic, and somewhat chilling visions through the screen of his game gear. And he keeps his sense of humor throughout. ""I see you...leading us all into a great battle... what's this? You're wearing a dress!"" ""What?"" ""Psych! What a bonehead."" I do not believe the writers were given the credit they deserve on this film. The enitire thing was so realistic, I thought I was actually in Patu San, and was disappointed when I found out the country was fictional. As a closing I would like to say that Ernie Reyes Jr. will astound you, not only with his amazing skills as a thesbian, but with his suberb singing voice in his clever, modified rendition of ""Baba Ram."" Truly an amazing specticle from first to last, one of the best movies of the 20th century. Move over Jackie Chan, he comes Ernie Reyes Jr!",991872000,3,2292,4.7325
749282,4,6303962467,"If I had to sum up this movie in 2 words they would be...Rob, Schneider.  Rob Schneider is at the top of his comedy peak in this hang ten flick. Sure there are some of you who are saying, ""What are you crazy?  It's Ernie Reyes Jr. that makes this movie enjoyable!""  And then there are those of you who insist that, ""Leslie Nielson hasn't been this funny since...well... He's never been this funny!""  Before you rally yourselves into a rioting frenzy, let me explain. The inner struggle of Rob Schneider's character compells the audience to care about wether or not his goals are accomplished in this movie.  His constant use of method acting, (Which was finely polished on SNL.) suspends our disbelief as we root for him to come home alive.  However, it was the Producers insistence on casting Leslie Nielson that earned this movie 4 stars instead of 5.",983059200,,853,4.6158940397351

Unlike other ninja movies coming out at the same time,  meant for the younger audiences, Surf Ninjas comes back at it with a joke  for everything that may be found rediculous in a Jackie Chan movie, or  worse!

749571,5,6303962467,"I loved this movie as a kid, and have found that it has aged well. It's another story of normal idiots doing extraordinary things. Sort of a Bill and Ted with Arthurian Legend. The characters are all likeable and play themselves well.

After watching it one day, my sister pointed out it was the first movie she saw where the majority were played by Asian Americans. It's interesting because it is never held very strongly as a part of the story. The villain is white simply because he's played by Leslie Nelson. The same goes for Rob Schneider's character, if anything, he plays a more intelligent version of his usual character. The settings and designs are never important or get in the way of the great fun the story gives. They have twists and turns, and constant jokes about their situation. You should expect people yelling far out, and doing dumb things in the story as they topple an army and reclaim the throne.

I should mention one cool twist to the story. It turns out the Uncle is the in real life father of the oldest brother. Also, Stacy from Phineas and Ferb is a major member of the team.",1472342400,,1106,4.497512437810945

Zatch: Something not even money can buy: the knives of Kwantsu.
Iggy: Knives? Oh yeah, seriously. That's something money can't buy. Knives. Once I went to a cutlery store and said 'Here's $100,000, can I buy a knife?' They said, 'NO. Money can't buy knives.' Gee, I guess that's why you hardly ever see any of 'em around.
[Later]
Iggy: On the third day of the expedition they came across a giant rubber plant. Unfortunately, they could not cut it down, for as we know, money can't buy knives. Walking around the plant, they continued on the shores of Patusan.
Zatch: Is there no way we can shut this chattering monkey up?

749944,5,6303962467,"Surf Ninjas is a 2002 DVD of the 1993 action-adventure family comedy starring martial arts legend Ernie Reyes Jr.(Sidekicks), Rob Schneider(Deuce Bigelow, European Gigolo), Nicolas Cowan, Ernie Reyes Sr.(Ernie Jr.'s Dad), rap music superstar Tone Loc(Funky Cold Medina), Kelly Hu(Hawaii 5-0), and the late Leslie Nielsen(The Naked Gun 2 And A Half). Directed by Neal Israel, the film involves two orphan brothers(Reyes and Cowan) who learned they are the lost long princes of a kingdon in southeast Asia that is ruled by a laughable but ruthless warlord(Nielsen), so with the help of their friends and martial arts training, the brothers battle the warlord in an epic and super awesome battle sequence. The ending is really nice as the brothers joined their people in singing a Beach Boys standard. The special features include the trailer for the film, and a interactive game. Surf Ninjas is a treat for kids and parents!",1437091200,,922,5.153333333333333

I watched this movie a lot as a kid.  It was one of my favorites.  Don't ask me why? But, like I said earlier, its simple. You'll laugh at it in spite of yourself.  I'd have to say the Leslie Nielsen and Rob Schneider are the real stars of the show.  Rob Schneider is funny no matter what movie he's in.  And, the thought of Leslie Nielsen as an evil warlord who will stop at nothing to keep our ninja warriors from reaching their destiny is too hilarious to be true.

750831,3,6303962467,"For kids, Surf Ninjas nails it.  Camoflaged ninjas show up in California to kill two surfer kids, who just happen to be heirs to the throne of Patusan.  In no time at all, assassination hijinks ensue amidst slapstick comedy and ubiquitous one-liners.  As for adult viewing...

Usually when you combine two words like ""surf"" and ""ninja"", there is an awesome reason that holds everyone in captivated attention.  It's like ""pirate midget"", ""viral monkey"", ""skydiving karate"", or ""robot dynamite"" - these things simply work together.  I defy anyone to name a movie that didn't improve because of the addition of a midget, a monkey, or a robot!  Someone really has to screw up to make something titled ""Surf Ninjas"" an average, corny, chop-sockey kid flick.

Ernie Reyes is as talented as ever, providing kicks, punches, scowls, and hiyaahs to every sequence.  Leslie Nielsen is still the master of slapstick.  Rob Schneider is still fairly unbearable, as always.  Tone Loc makes an appearance for no reason whatsoever.

It's only slightly interesting - mainly a direct result of Reyes' martial arts skills and Leslie Neilsen doing what he does - but it's probably going to bore an adult who didn't have to fight through the 6th grade.",1215561600,,1230,4.9754901960784315

The best way to describe this movie is ""Chairman of the Board""
(Carrot Top's movie. Yes, I've seen that one too) meets ""3 Ninjas"".

The humor is stupid, but never low-brow (except for Leslie Nielsen's malfunctioning bionic hand scene) and overall the film is upbeat.

You would think that Leslie Nielsen would steal the show, but it's really the interplay between the entire cast that produces the most memorable moments.  Although the best lines belong to Rob Schneider's ""Iggy"".

Iggy' monologue about how ""Money can't buy knives"" is one of the highlights of the film and Tone Loc is a funny, if not odd addition to the cast.

Surf Ninjas is a fun adventure movie, with plenty of laughs, even if the product placement is a little obvious.

The basic plot is good and for the most part well rounded other than not explaining how a white guy became Colonel Chi and why he wanted to take over the island. The acting is so so. Ernie Reyes, Jr. did a good job and Rob Schneider was humorous. The lines were somewhat lame but there were a few classic lines that may be in the minds of fans for a long time.

750933,4,6303962467,"So this is one of the IMDB worst 100 with good reason. The plotline is threadbare and absurd and the whole point is to get a couple of chuckles while some guys do martial arts.

So how the heck did it get 4 stars from me?

Well, I think that it's meant to be both horrible and funny. You get Ernie Reyes Jr. as the typical '90s teenager who meets an exotic Asian woman grounded in ancient traditions, asking ""Uh, would you like to go to the mall sometime?""

Granted, I prefer more wit in a movie. I'm not going to rate it as 5-stars because it's not. But it's cute for the little kid to be able to control the future with a Sega. And it's fun to have a character who waxes a surfboard every day to fit in, but can't actually surf at all. And let's face it: deep down in our souls we all want to randomly become amazing.

Yeah, okay, so already you have to leave your brain at the door if you want to enjoy this movie.  If you can manage to do that, it's cute and funny and Reyes has a charming performance as a typical teenage surfer who realizes that he's so much more and kinda doesn't really care.  Also check out the princess who when I first saw the movie like 10 years ago, thought she was a nobody and now find out that it's Kelly Hu...who I guess even today is sort of still a nobody but for those who recognize her, she was in the Scorpion King with the Rock and played Yuriko in X2.",1101340800,2,975,4.197860962566845
