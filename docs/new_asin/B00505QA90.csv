4511558,4,B00505QA90,"I'm not a fan of MMA. I don't hate it and I can sit down and watch it, but I'm not a fan of the sport. I'm also fairly certain I've never seen a Gavin O'Connor directed film until now. To be honest, the one thing that made me want to see this movie was Tom Hardy getting top billing. Hardy's been around awhile, but most probably didn't give the guy much thought until he started showing up in Christopher Nolan films. Bronson was the movie that made me admire his talent though. Warrior is fairly outstanding in general anyway, but could also give even more weight to Hardy's name.

Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) lost everything when he was a drunk. His wife died without him by her bedside and both of his sons cut him off almost completely. His younger son Tommy (Tom Hardy) shows up on his doorstep one day after being in the army wanting nothing more than a coach for the big Spartan MMA tournament coming up. Tommy is withdrawn and doesn't want to share anything about his life and it turns out that there's a reason for that. Meanwhile Paddy's other son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is facing a foreclosure on his house and was suspended from his teaching job after being caught fighting in the parking lot of a strip club. Brendan enters the tournament in hopes of keeping his family afloat while Tommy's purpose has something to do with his army brethren. Warrior is more of a story about the Conlon family struggling to find it within themselves to forgive each other rather than who will win this massive MMA tournament.

The cast is really phenomenal in this. Nick Nolte manages to outshine both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as far as performances go. While Hardy and Edgerton are off beating the crap out of each other in the cage, Nolte portrays some amazing emotion. You can tell he's a broken man trying to get his life back on track and everything seems to be blowing up in his face. Joel Edgerton really plays up the whole underdog thing. A physics teacher in an MMA tournament? He doesn't stand a chance. Edgerton displays emotion as well, but his performance is otherwise forgettable. Tom Hardy plays the typical tough guy. Nothing is going to stand in his way. He'd rather not talk if he can help it, but he's an absolute beast in that cage. While each lead actor in the movie has their own strengths and weaknesses, they have all the bases covered between the three of them to make everything come together.

Some of the supporting cast is really interesting. This was an intriguing film to follow up leaving ""House, MD"" for Jennifer Morrison and it's nice to see Kevin Dunn be at least somewhat amusing and not completely irritating like he was in the Transformers movies. It was crazy seeing Kurt Angle in this though, especially as a Russian. It's as if he was playing a modern day version of Ivan Drago who took up MMA instead of boxing and never had anything to say about it.

Warrior did have its shortcomings though. It is a bit clich and predictable. The whole movie is centered on these two brothers finally fighting in the cage and you can probably guess who's going to win; is it going to be the guy that breaks every rule imaginable with a chip on his shoulder or the kind, warm school teacher with a family that everybody loves? But the whole experience was about more than just who would win that fight though. Thankfully there's a bit of a deeper meaning to it. The camera work got really annoying at times as well though. It was as if it was attempting to go for this gritty, realistic style and it just came off as somebody not being able to hold a camera steadily or terrible perspectives that blocked more of the shot than anything else.

Warrior packs one hell of a punch. Its incredible, emotional, and powerful story is told by a talented cast amongst a flurry of knockout punches and submission holds that'll force you to tap to the spectacular journey you just experienced. Nick Nolte gives a scene stealing performance while Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton pick up the scraps and tend to take pride in delivering what Nolte couldn't follow up on. While Warrior does have its flaws, it's essentially to MMA what The Fighter was to boxing. In the end, Warrior is surprisingly heartfelt and delivers a wonderful message.",1315094400,4,4250,4.543080939947781

4511565,5,B00505QA90,"I think this is my all-time favorite fight movie. Hardy, Edgerton and Nolte all hit it square on the nose. The entire cast was great (except maybe the principal, but that's negligible). The fights were great enough to suspend disbelief (my legs and arms would occasionally twitch involuntarily!) and the story line was captivating throughout, with a tear-jerking ending, especially for siblings with sorted histories.",1528416000,,417,5.430769230769231

4511568,5,B00505QA90,"I watch a lot of movies, I'd say roughly 12-15 a week. I'm a stay at home dad and I watch them while I cook, clean, and as I am settling down to sleep. I have been doing it for a loooong time. I like movies. So when it comes to rating them, I suppose it's only natural that I dole out a lot of 4 stars. However, because I have seen so many, each movie in itself must compete with a list of films which includes most of the greatest creations ever captured on camera. So the 5 stars are much more rare. To say a film has made my own private top 10 list means I have found it better than hundreds upon hundreds of films. This one makes it to my top 5.
Yes, the acting is amazing. The cinematography is outstanding. The balance of action and drama is frankly matched only by ""Apocalypse Now"" and that director had to steal off into the jungle with a blank check and blow up half the Philippines to accomplish what he did. However, this movie is, in my opinion, unique in way that is not capable of being described by a word or blurb. There is no award for the thing that made this film so great. I will try to describe its nature, though.
To me, it had elements of many eras and styles of film which I would have considered impossible to combine. I saw here the over the top symbolism of the 60's; think ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" I saw here the gritty but tightly focused individualism of the 70's; think ""Mean Streets,"" or the more obvious ""Rocky."" I saw here the blatant emotionalism of the 80's, think ""The Breakfast Club."" I saw here the academic referential dalliance of the 90's; think ""Miller's Crossing,"" I saw here the journalistic aloofness of the post millennial films; think ""Hurt Locker."" Each of these iconic films represents, to me, a stylistic tendency that might evoke either praise or criticism on the part of the viewer as the vagaries of personal taste and fashion of the moment dictate. Certainly, before I saw this film, I would have thought some of these styles not only incompatible but mutually exclusive. The plot weave is also very odd. The slow merging of storyline might bring to mind such films as ""Traffic"" or ""Babel"" but where those films slowly reveal a connection of the unexpected, this film slowly reveals a connection of the inevitable. By the time I finished my first run of this film, I was left with the feeling that I had watched at least three separate but fantastically emotional films in the space of a little more than 2 hours. I had only absently clicked on the title at bedtime guided by a vague disposition towards fight movies and an appreciation of the versatility of Ben Hardy. I stopped rewatching it after the light of morning was streaming through the bedroom windows.
In an attempt to find a critical appraisal that was less than shining as I groped for a way to more holistically define what I had just experienced, I did stumble across the word clich. I would say that it was clich like Homer.
It might be a man thing, too, possibly. Even for a fight movie there was a whole lot of time spent on action in the ring. But that was another thing. There is not just one climactic fight. There are like 4 or so. How is it possible to have more than one climax? It's difficult to describe. Maybe that's more of a woman thing. I have to say that when it was over I didn't want to roll over and go to sleep. Instead I wanted to sit around and talk about my feelings.",1528243200,,3411,4.33125

He's doing a bad Stallone impression in this movie and its not believable. If he sounds like he is doing a voice it isn't good acting.  Come on already. The dialogue is painful at times. Get better taste in movies people, I laughed at people saying ""best movie ever made"" here on Amazon. Now watch, Hardy is going to try to play Al Capone in a movie, I've seen the pictures of him in ""costume"" and, again, its not believable. Some paid media is already saying it ""his best transformation yet"" He's squinting and has his head shaved and he is desperately trying to look mean, AMAZING TRANSFORMATION.

4511701,5,B00505QA90,"The movie WARRIOR is out this week in a new 4k resolution edition. Looking back I was surprised that the movie is already 6 years old and for some reason flew under my radar. Dont get me wrong, I mean I heard about the movie but for some reason never got around to seeing it. Until now.

The movie focuses on the lives of three men. First up is Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte), an ex-boxer turned alcoholic in the midst of going sober. Paddy was a terrible father whose boozing ways broke up his family and left him with next to nothing. Then there is Tommy (Tom Hardy), a tough young man who left with his mother long ago, a high school wrestling champ with a chip on his shoulder, forced to watch his mother die and just returned to visit Paddy. And lastly there is Brendan (Joel Edgerton), the elder son who remained with Paddy suffering his abuse and eventually cutting ties with him, now a physics teacher, happily married and the father of two. These three stories connect as we learn about the various issues each is facing, the stories culminating in the ring of a special MMA fight.

The focus is mainly on the two brothers. Tommy has changed his name to his mothers maiden name and is filled with an ancient rage that won't let go. He goes to work out in a local gym while visiting Paddy and in a sparring match knocks out the local MMA top dog cold. This was the man who was supposed to enter Sparta, an event bringing together the top 16 fighters to determine once and for all who the best is. But Tommy is also carrying a secret with him, another reason for the name change that comes out later in the film.

Brendan is having financial issues that cause a problem at work. A refinancing structure by the bank has left his family with potentially losing their home. In an effort to make extra money he fights in an off the books MMA match in a strip club parking lot. This incurs the wrath of his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) since the couple decided hed never fight again. Footage of the fight ends up online and also finds himself in trouble with the school system, getting suspended pending an investigation. Now the fight circuit is the only way for him to make money until that suspension is lifted. Training with an old friend, an injury to that schools champion for the Sparta event leaves an opening for him to enter.

Reasons for both to win the match and the $5 million dollar prize are presented before the match begins. Each of the brothers is the underdog, Brendan more so, as they battle the opposition to get to the finals. Brendan even has to face off an undefeated terror from Russia named Kobar (Kurt Angle). The Rocky type story find you rooting for both men. But what happens when they must face off against one another? With noble motivations who can you root for?

Some might consider this film just another fight flick and theyd be wrong. It is the story of a family torn apart years ago, who no longer communicates on the basest level, formed by three men who still carry the pain from their shared past experiences. It is a story where you wait to see if they can surmount those differences and come together once again.

The movie is exceptionally well made, directed by went on to direct JANE GOT A GUN and the recent THE ACCOUNTANT. As co-author of the script hes also crafted a well spun story giving what could have been just another fight film some depth. The performances are fantastic to watch. Nolte may have a more supporting role but he plays it remarkably well. Edgerton displays the sensitive fighter who may be in over his head but who struggles anyway. And Hardy, who has become a force to be reckoned with in the acting field, gives early signs of what was to come over the years. The movie is a treat to watch.

This new release of the film comes packed with extras that are as interesting as the film itself. They include the usual blooper reel, the documentary REDEMPTION: BRINGING WARRIOR TO LIFE, PHILOSOPY IN COMBAT: MIXED MARTIAL ARTS STRATEGY, a breakdown of the climactic fight, an audio commentary track, an enhanced viewing mode and a tribute to Charles Mask Lewis Jr. a consultant on the film and one of the founders of Tapout, the clothing manufacturer for the MMA circuit.

The biggest news here though is that the film is being released in a 4k ultra HD format. The format yields the cleanest and sharpest picture you can achieve currently. In addition to that disc there is the blu-ray version as well as the digital code to place your copy in your online digital account. Watching and enjoying the film in the blu-ray format made me long for a 4k system to enjoy the movie that much more. In the meantime Ill hold on to it until that day comes and plan on enjoying the movie once again on that day.",1510185600,,4764,4.44279176201373

4511709,4,B00505QA90,"Warrior is the story of a family feud set amid an Atlantic City mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy), a former Iraq war-vet Marine, returns home for the first time in fourteen years. His brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), is an ex-fighter-turned-high-school Pittsburgh physics teacher, and family man. Tommy asks Paddy, the alcoholic father he hates (Nick Nolte), but who trained him to wrestling victories as a youth, to train him again for Sparta, a worldwide event with a victors multimillion-dollar prize.

Against the wishes of his wife (Jennifer Morrison) but facing foreclosure on his home, Brendan goes back to moonlighting, taking illegal fights for cash. His unlikely underdog rise sets him on a path to Sparta and a collision course with the unstoppable Tommy.

Both Hardy and Edgerton bulked up and trained to get in shape and look authentic in their staged fights. Nolte is excellent, conveying grizzled toughness as well as vulnerability in a role that seems tailor-made for him.

Though the film falls back on many sports flick cliches, it is nonetheless entertaining, with Hardy, Edgerton and Nolte turning in fine performances and elevating the picture considerably.

Bonus materials on the 2-disc PG-13 rated 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray release include 3 behind-the-scenes featurettes; gag reel; deleted scene with optional commentary; audio commentary with writer-director Gavin OConnor, co-writer Anthony Tambakis, editor John Gilroy and actor Joel Edgerton; and an in-depth original and personal look at Warrior with the cast and crew.

It tried to cover all the bases with a sickly child, money problems, alcoholic father, love story, and war hero. But anyone who's watched more than 1 MMA match would know that an amateur fighter 30+ years old teacher by day could not win 4 consecutive matches no matter ""what they're fighting for"". To save you the time the teacher brother beats the #1 fighter in the world and his brother Tommy, (who just beat 3 fighters in a total of 15 seconds of fighting by way of 3 insane fast knockouts) and 2 others. I understand there's a component of luck to fighting and in movies to suspend believability, but come on I was laughing out loud at the ending.",1503446400,,805,4.409395973154362

I was not disappointed at  all.  Tom Hardy belongs in the same category as Viggo Mortensen, Russell Crowe,  Jake Gillenhall, Brando, Hanks, Daniel Day Lewis, DeCaprio, Denzel, DeNiro and Morgan Freeman and Christian Bale.  I love it when great actors can bring me to tears.  co- stars Joel Edgerton and Nolte both added additional creditability to how deep family emotion is even in ordinary middle America just trying to survive in what has been dealt to them.  I really hated to see the movie end, this is one of the great ones.  Can't say enough about Tom Hardy, Bravo.",1484179200,,721,4.758064516129032

4511890,5,B00505QA90,"Weve all seen the heart wrenching melodrama, the classic feud of two men battling to be the victor, and the thrilling action picture that keeps you on your toes. Director Gavin OConnor combines the three into his motion picture Warrior, a tale between two brothers that uncovers an unforgiving childhood and life long family struggle. Were introduced to a troubled family of two brothers, Tommy Reardon (Tom Hardy), a former Marine whose returned home to Pittsburgh after over a decade, and Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) a high school physics teacher trying to make his way through raising a family and keep the home he and his wife (Jennifer Morrison) have.

After being separated for 14 years, brothers Tommy and Brendan are reunited once again. Brought together by the desperation to make a living, the two enter into the ultimate mixed martial arts tournament, Sparta. Tommy seeks out former coach and alcoholic father Paddy (Nick Nolte), who had coached him all the way to a wrestling sate championship title in high school. Brendan, former UFC fighter turned teacher, asks the help of long time friend Frank Grillo, who is famous for creating MMA champions. With the promise of a $5 million dollar purse to the winner, Tommy and Brendan train for the fight of their lives.

OConnor provides thrilling fight scenes filled with brutal punches and bloody faces. As far as script, OConnor goes a little clich at times, example being Grillos classic coaching line, Listen to the music, feel the Beethoven. However, the dialogue between Brendan, Tommy and Paddy is heart wrenching, which makes the clichs easily forgettable. The movie is a loaded drama with the unyielding anger of Tommy, and the desperation of Brendan in their quest for fortune. Theres something poetic in the tale of two brothers once again coming together in the heat of battle, stricken by an unsettling childhood and hatred of their father. The fighters tenacity and determination are well depicted through their final round in the octagon in the Sparta tournament.

Its hard to imagine the movie ever coming to an end with such a complex plot and energetic screenplay. Quick camera ducks and fast paced movements keep the audience on their feet, and frequent switches from scenes with Brendans family and Tommys previous life in the military continue to add emotional connections with the audience. The fight scenes could have done less with such jolting and shaky camera movements, but OConnors direction still managed to capture the drama and thrill of the fight. Warrior will leave you wanting both brothers to win following the brutal battle. The well written storyline takes you through what could very well be a real family struggle, and hits home with the audience once Brendan and Tommy are brought back together despite their hardships. Warrior satisfies the criteria of a action film through its ferocious fight scenes and character flashbacks, as well as satisfies a drama film by trying to piece a broken family back together.",1475452800,,3013,5.046184738955823

4511970,5,B00505QA90,"Warrior is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

  I mean that. It's a wonderful, heart touching movie about two brothers who have a torrid past with an alcoholic father and a very sick mother who left to escape the abuse. One ran off to take his life in his own hands, the other stayed and watched their mother wither away and die, then joined the military where things didn't work out like he'd planned.

 They're brought together for the first time in many years at the promise of a LOT of money for taking the prize in a privately funded MMA tournament intended to replicate the kind of extreme physical competition rumored to have existed in the old day, when death due to injury was common in sports in general, much less combat sports.

  The premise is somewhat hokey, I will pull no punches over that. The idea some guy that's a science teacher with an MMA background but hasn't actually practiced in 10 years or so, and wasn't that great when he did, would stand a chance against any professional fighter that was currently ranked and competing is ludicrous. While you could argue the military brother is more believable, it's not a solid argument. I trained, and I competed, I love martial arts to this day and still practice. I've sparred with a LOT of Marine Corp guys over the years, in and outside of gyms, they have so much heart and fight in them it makes practicing with them dangerous, but most to them. They will not give up, and it takes the fun out of training. I've also seen a lot of them get manhandled by people far younger than them, to the point they get hurt, and never come back to the gym. Hardy's ""Tommy"" would have been one of these guys if this was real. That's because when you throw in that these guys are supposed to be competing against the world's best, and most capable physical specimens, who spend 16-20 hours a day doing nothing but MMA and endurance/toughness training, and it's a fairy tale scenario. But that is what all movies are in the end.

  The characterizations of the brothers are incredible though, Brandon is the family man, lots of heart, lots of ""try"", not a large capacity for violence and a thinking man at heart. ""The Tactician"". Tommy, the opposite, raw strength and rage, all fueled from pain and suffering. Hardy does a great, and I mean great job at appearing to be a man with the mentality of a cornered and terrified lion deep inside of him. ""The Warrior"". Every fight could be his last, everyone is an object to plow through because every fight alleviates some of his pain by making him feel like he's closer to being able to fulfill his duties as a soldier, and friend to the only family he perceives he ever had.

I can't stress enough that if you haven't seen this movie, don't hesitate before renting or buying it.",1467763200,,2788,4.477317554240631

And the ultimate fool interweaving their hope of the ""people"" in the movie to go fight ISIS because they didn't want them over here...be careful of the kick in the teeth you are sure to get.

4512057,5,B00505QA90,"This is NOT a sports movie. Let's get that out of the way. The MMA action is good, but is it the vehicle that drives the real story.
This is a family drama, the story of a family destroyed by an alcoholic, violent father  Paddy Conlon, portrayed by Nick Nolte. He has 2 sons, and no one gets along. The elder son, Brendan (  Joel Edgerton) has fared much better than his brother Tommy (Tom Hardy) . Brendan is a high school Physics teacher, married with two kids. Tommy is an angry drifter who numbs himself with pills and booze.  Tommy drifts right back into his fathers life in an odd love/hate dynamic.  Paddy Conlon is has been sober for 1000 days. Nolte offers up an incredible, heartbreaking performance as a man who realizes how much damage he has done, and  has no way to undo it. He is kept away from his grandchildren for their protection.
Tommy is skilled wrestler, trained by his father many years ago, so he is a perfect fit for the MMA ring. In those scenes, he is a beast, obviously fighting more than his opponents, whom he destroys.  Brendan fought years ago, but was, as one announcer described him, memorable for not being memorable.
The brothers are drawn to the same competition, one to save his home from foreclosure, the other to earn money to give the widow & children of a war buddy killed in a friendly fire incident.
The ending fight is wrenching to watch as the brothers battle, taking out a lifetime of anger and disappointment on each other.  Tommy continues to fight the entire world, everything he experienced, all alone. No one is in his corner, he has pushed everyone away. This drives the film to the brutal and beautiful climax.
This would be worth watching for Nick Nolte's  performance alone. Tom Hardy delivers an amazing performance, yet again.  He is proving himself to be one of the best actors of our time period.",1461628800,,1856,4.532934131736527

4512080,5,B00505QA90,"In a genre where there are junkyard dogs and prize ponies galore, Warrior leaves no cliche out and no scenery un-chewed. I won't bore you with the entirely predictable plot, the obvious twists and the uneven casting and acting, but in the end none of that matters.

If Tom Hardy doesn't break your heart into a thousand pieces you don't have one. This might be his best performance (and I'm including his best film previously Child 44 in that evaluation) and it makes you weep that he was wasted with nothing to do in Mad Max. What might have been... sigh...  My wife's comment may have summed it up the best. That no one can convey the baggage of suffering like Hardy. Not the suffering itself, lots of actors can do that, but the existential burden of it.

I would take him in two seconds to replace Daniel Craig. He would give Bond dimensions that Craig has hinted at, but not explored fully due to the conventions of Bond films. Hardy would take Bond to a whole new level perhaps appropriate to the angst of our times.

Ancillary comments - Nick Nolte is good, even more than good, but he has no chemistry with either of the brothers. His character (the dried out dad) might have been better in the sons' imaginations (off-screen).

The fights. Very, very convincingly shot and choreographed.  Hardy's explosive violence is... I can't even describe how powerful a metaphor for his psychic rage it is. Highly recommended.",1459382400,,1424,4.653386454183267

Trust me, if you are a fan of ""Rocky"", this movie will not disappoint.

Hollywood always makes Marines out to be maniacal substance abusing menaces to society.  I could list all the movies but it would take to long.  Everything from Jack Nicholson in a Few Good Men to Robert Redford's ridiculous assertion in ""The Last Castle"" that a Marine Corp corporal doesn't even know how to salute.  How about Heartbreak Ridge with its premise that a Marine Recon unit could be filled with undisciplined substandard Marines that have no infantry skills?  I know Hollywood and celebrities in general constantly condemn war.  I'm fine with that.  Stop trying so hard to make the men that defend your freedom look so bad.  Celebrities live in fantasy land.  Most of them are just over the top silly caricatures of the charactors they play.  Nobody is a bigger phony tough guy than Stallone.  Steals the life story of Chuck Wepner, makes Rocky, ordered to pay Chuck Wepner by court.  He has never done anything in real life to remotely resemble his onscreen persona.

4512218,2,B00505QA90,"This film tries (really hard) to use a common trope in sports movies--the ""blue collar guy(s) overcome all odds to win the big prize"" storyline typified by the ""Rocky"" films. The first half of ""Warrior"" is actually quite good; it sets up the conflict between the major characters well and it seems like we're going to get a good slice of life drama. But then, the script-driven coincidences start to pile up, the willing suspension of disbelief is eviscerated, and by the end, I didn't really care who won the climactic fight.

Sports movies generally leave me cold unless there's a twist involved (such as the main character LOSING the big game/fight/match, as in ""Rocky""). This film tries for the ""feel good triumph of the human spirit"" vibe and just doesn't have the dramatic wherewithal to make it work. There's a good performance by Nick Nolte, though.",1447891200,,857,4.829931972789115

Some scenes could potentionally be tough to watchas there are, as one would likely assume, a fair amount of fight scenes. That being said the violence is nothing overly gruesome and spread out.

4512300,5,B00505QA90,"I own this movie on three seperate bases, and I have to say it is hands downone of the best fighting movies made. Not only does it spur on an array of different emotions through the family ties and situations, to the level of discontent relations narrowing like a tunnel in the end. Amazing performances from the entire cast, really just spectacular acting throughought. It has many levels as a film for viewers to enjoy, very open in a sense that no one can keep closed doors forever, and that moving on is not only possible, but necessary.

The fighing in the film is also top notch, obviously having some of the MMA world's foremost content advisors, to the actual UFC fighters and Commentators. It pulls together to be a very welldont effort in fight coreography, having top martial artists mixed with actors can't be easy. Although it walks with it, with a strut, and keeps you guessing. Basically when it came to thinking about the energy of the movie it was very, carrying, it just boosted slowly and seemed so fast before you know it its over and you are left wanting more, much more. But saying that it definitely ends well and has no disappointments as do the best of films. Great effort and I would recommend to anyone wishing to see a great movie.",1441238400,,1259,4.546255506607929

4512306,4,B00505QA90,"Though not totally original, there's enough spin on this ball to hold the viewer's interest.

Here's the scoop. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) teaches high school, but his daughter's medical bills have put him in the red, He picks up mixed martial arts cage fights on the weekends for extra cash. His brother Tom (Tom Hardy) is a war hero gone AWOL who comes to town to have his father Paddy (Nick Nolte) train him for an upcoming elimination match with a huge purse. Dad is seriously disliked by both brothers in spite of the fact he's cleaned up his act. Both brothers need the dough and must claw their way up the elimination.

I liked this film a lot. The cast is outstanding. All do a stand up job and have some great lines to chew on. Jennifer Morrison, as Joel's wife is good but her role is a bit on the cliche side. Frank Grillo, as Joel's trainer is also very good. He delivers his lines with a great ease. I believed him totally. One does need to suspend their disbelief to a reasonable degree here. That both brothers would make the cut to enter this expensive, widely televised event does strain credulity. But the back stories are good and and are meted out at regular intervals to keep the viewer in the game. The relationship between the two brothers and their father is really good. No warm fuzzies here.

The directing is efficient and the production values are on par with the content. It's a very professional endeavor.

For what it is, it's about as good as you're likely to see.",1440892800,,1500,4.483516483516484

Plus, you get to hear what to trainers are telling the fighters in the ring (which is really interesting all the technical advice that is given mid-fight).

Even better than Cinderella Man, but same idea. Two brothers who are driven to fight by outside forces, and have a motivation to make a better life for the ones they care about that moves them forward.",1440115200,,510,4.604395604395604

4512339,2,B00505QA90,"I didn't like this movie much. It was full of cliches, maybe more cliches than punches and there must have been a thousand punches. Lots of pretentious whispering and buckets of excessive emotion. I didn't like the hero guy and he was the most admirable of the bunch. It might have been because nobody had any charisma. Nobody seemed real. If there are people like this in the USA I hope the government sends them off to fight ISIS until they either win or are killed because I don't want them over here (talking about the people in this film).

I didn't like the wife who was trying so hard to be shlompy fit in her baggy pants. It didn't seem likely that she was madly in love with the hero and his brother was a hulking idiot caricature. The hero was gonna lose his house but he was a physics teacher who works with numbers and calculations all the time. How could this sneak up on him like that and then he's worshipped by everybody in the film except for his superior at the school for going into this animalistic sport and beating the tar out of strangers. I had no problem when Walt, the chemistry teacher went into the meth business because I guess there was a lot of humor in that situation whereas this was portrayed as the American Way. In Breaking Bad we get to meet a lot of funny characters, learn about their lives and have some laughs at their situations. This thing had none of that. In Warrior the guy needs some money and just decides to use his slightly dormant killing skills to thrash his way to the top. I had to wonder why he bothered with teaching at all.

His students were blood thirsty as was his wife and his boss and all the mobs that went to see him and then there's his father, played by Nick Nolte in yet another fight film who was also not likeable. He played the part of a caged fighting dog that had been set fire to a few times and he actually convincingly growls in this movie. His son, the hero treats him horribly and drives him back to the bottle for no reason and then later there's a lot of sweaty hugging, farting and whispering as they try to make up but because Nolte is a badly abused dog he doesn't really understand and he has to be restrained forcibly throughout the whole loving scene to prevent the hero from being bitten. The same thing happened with the brother in the ring. Its like the movie is saying ""this is what family life is like in America"" and we're all cheering wildly and giving it five stars.

I don't want you to think that I didn't like the movie because it portrayed this dysfunctional American family as heroic or average. I'd rather you think I didn't like Warrior because it was kind of boring and hard to watch. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing. It has some good actors but its not much of a story and nobody is likeable or hateable. It is vastly overrated boxing drivel.",1438905600,2,2859,4.300556586270872

It is about fighting no matter the odds and not giving up with some great MMA scenes thrown in as well. I was very impressed as well watching the extras and I learned a lot about one of the backers of the movie who sadly passed away before the movie was released but you should watch the extra scenes it is worth it.

midst of a 5 million dollar winner take all MMA tournament.  One brother Tommy (Hardy) went with his mother and lived in poverty, joined the Marines when she died and became a hero overseas.  The other brother Brendon remained with his alcoholic father and married his childhood love.

4512577,3,B00505QA90,"Warrior
 This film is interesting only for the fight scenes, which are very very good indeed.
 The story line takes us much too long to understand the motives of the protagonists, in this case two battling brothers, their dad and the wife of one brother.  By the time the main action of the film happens, we still do not know enough about those involved to really bond with them, and thus to care about them.  That is too bad too, because by the end, we do know almost enough about them to give a hoot about who wins or who loses the fights.  A little more on the front end as far as character development is concerned would have changed this interesting two saw blade fight flick into something memorable.
 The responsibility rests in the hands of writer/director Gavin OConnor.  He now has nine films under his belt and has proven his abilities.  He directed the good hockey film Miracle a few years ago.  He can put together fast action in an exciting and accessible way.  We watch the men battle each other in the Ultimate Fighting matches and not only are able to follow the course of the fighting, but are also thrilled and titillated by the action.  He also wrote the script, which had all the elements necessary, but lacked in the proper ordering of them and the proper quantity of them.  He doles out the information on the fighters in very small doses, information which we need early on in order to develop affection or even understanding of the men.
 That said, the acting by the two main actors is good enough for the genre.  Australian Joel Edgerton (37) plays the game but too old for the competition elder brother.  Englands Tom Hardy takes the role as the absolutely ferocious younger brother in a high stakes martial arts smack down.  Both actors are well seasoned pros with many credits on their rsums.  The fact that they do not stand out is not theirs but rather the casting director.
 Nick Nolte is absolutely outstanding as the broken, flawed, recovering alcoholic wife beater father of the two brothers.  It would have taken actors of similar experience and enormous power to share the screen with him in anything like a favorable way.  Also outstanding in an even smaller role is Jennifer Morrison (House on TV and briefly as Kirks mom in the recent Star Trek Nemesis.)  Her beauty and animation literally light up the screen.  She is making a sustained effort to transition from the small screen to the big one.  I hope she can because she does have that certain something that makes for a movie star, that all too rare ability to connect with the audience.
 But the fight scenes, the money scenes for this film, are what make it worthwhile at all.  If sport films are your thing, this will be enough for you.
 Warrior has been given a tame PG-13 rating for theme and violence.  It runs a long two hours and 19 minutes, much of it given to the fighting.  The producers spent $25 million on this film which in four weeks has brought in only $13 million.  They will be as disappointed as I was.",1425772800,,3018,4.526802218114603

4512585,5,B00505QA90,"I was drawn to get this film after seeing an article about Joel Edgerton's workout routine for this film (of all things : -)  I liked his portrayal of a Seal team leader in Zero Dark Thirty, though it was a pretty brief part of the film.  But I was curious about his acting chops.

Well.  This was quite a surprise, this film about MMA fighters.  No, actually, about family and physicality and men workin' stuff out.  The fights and the training to get there were engrossing; the family story, however, made the fights into something worth watching and cheering with full emotional engagement.

Nolte got an academy award nomination for best supporting actor, and it was earned beautifully.  His opening scenes were subtle and done with such ease that he was immediately, IMMEDIATELY, the character, not Nick Nolte.  Joel Edgerton seemed type-cast in this film but nonetheless has some amazingly expressive moments, especially in interactions with the father (Nolte) and his coach.  The character has less overt angst in comparison to Tommy, played by Tom Hardy.  And that act was steller.  He should've gotten an academy award nomination for it.

The script was really good.  The look of the film was extraordinary for its portrayal of the towns and the culture of the east coast/Pittsburg.  All brought the actors to sublime heights in realizing very believable people working through very intense angst.  I am interested to see more of Edgerton, less type-cast, in the future.  He was pretty damn good.  But it is Hardy whose performance made me search for more by this actor, immediately.  Hardy's physical transformation for this role made me understand how such physicality is the existential ground of a character--it even slows speech down (and Hardy's accented embellishment with this character was totally convincing, just perfection).  The package makes the viewer aware of intensely felt embodiment.  On film when one can just observe (rather than interacting in real life with such a person), it becomes apparent how the mastery of strength and power physically can come to seem like the solution to threats and fears in life.  Hardy's inhabitation of that role was total and full and so very vulnerable at the same time.  That physicality only serves short-run aims and dilemmas; it is the strategy of biding time, control, application of skill...that must also be deployed to resolve the large issues of life.  It is both; symbolized in the two brothers facing off, and the one who prevails.  Wow.

For those living in the cerebral, go see this film even though you may not be into sports that much. It is a terrific study of why one must not live only from the neck up.  The slight sweetness of Tommy Riordan--interacting with the older waitress at the coffee shop; with the wife of his fallen comrade, and in seeing his father for the first time (totally surprising him)--in combination with the terrible fury of the fights--realized (for me) the depth of pain to be transcended.  And it was.

cheers, all.  Enjoy this highly recommended film.",1425254400,,3060,4.931506849315069

4512604,5,B00505QA90,"Great movie, must have especially if you're an MMA fan or fighter. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Shipping was right on time as well, was in perfect condition.",1423612800,,167,4.419354838709677
4512605,5,B00505QA90,"As I've probably mentioned before in the handful of reviews I've done for sports movies, I'm not the biggest fan of sports or sports movies in general. Still, I know a good film when I see one and WARRIOR is more than that: it's excellent. Befitting a film that deals with MMA and despite the PG-13 rating, it doesn't pull its punches physically or emotionally. This is probably one of the most intense movies I've seen from a visceral standpoint and on an emotional level. Without getting into too many specifics, the story is about two brothers who have been separated and on the outs for quite a long time. Due to personal circumstances, they both (inadvertently) enter the same MMA tournament and deal with relationship issues that have gone long unaddressed. The two leads, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton, both do an awesome job with the dramatic material while also bringing a believable physicality to their fight scenes. Although they are filmed and edited in a rather chaotic style, I thought that it worked here even if it came with the slight loss of comprehensibility. For the most part, however, you get to see all of the punches, throws and takedowns from a variety of perspectives. Also lending some dramatic heft to the film was veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays the brothers' father, also on bad terms with his sons for a variety of reasons. He was as fleshed out as were the two siblings and even gets a couple moments that seemed Oscar-worthy. In general, this wasn't some mindless story with a bunch of fight scenes strung together. Every fight had a purpose for the overall story, and there was plenty of back story for each main character to get you fully invested. So much so, that by the time the end comes around you don't know who to root for because they both have such strong motivations. It's like the Sophie's Choice of fight films. My only complaint, which is minor at best, is that once it does come around to the conclusion it lays on the melodrama a bit thick, and the final moment in the ring which was backed by an acoustic song had me rolling my eyes a little bit. Still, this was a powerful drama with incredibly brutal fight scenes that actually meant something. Even if you don't normally go for sports movies, this is one of the few that transcends that genre's limitations and manages to be inspirational without pandering. Highly recommended.",1423353600,6,2384,4.665083135391924
4512606,4,B00505QA90,"Man, the performances by Hardy, Nolte, and Edgerton were phenomenal. But, this movie still left a lot to be desired, I guess a bad script? Could have been great, instead just really good.",1423353600,,187,4.696969696969697

4512609,5,B00505QA90,"I have seen an extraordinary number of films from all over the world.  I can appreciate films in almost any genre.  This is quite possibly, the greatest film ever made.  The acting is beyond incredible - a film that speaks without dialogue.  You don't have to be a sports fan because there is a statement about human nature in this film that will move anybody.  I am generally fairly stoic - I almost never laugh or become emotional about films.  I have seen this movie three times and each time I am drenched in tears.  There is not another film that has ever managed to elicit much emotion from me.  This film absolutely brutalized me to the core.  There is something universal about the subtext that portrays loss, love, and redemption in a way that permeates the deepest irrational aspects of the human condition and reaches you in a way that is so profound, it is hard to describe.  Hardy, Edgerton, and Nolte do something truly incredible that is never found in contemporary cinema.  This is not a period piece or sociocultural commentary, it is about something far more innate and eternal.  This film is a monumental achievement that will stay with you.",1422835200,36,1160,4.6600985221674875

4512619,4,B00505QA90,"Having been given this film as a gift, I have to say that I was not looking forward to watching it; it lies way outside our usual film genres, we have no interest in sport of any kind, we've not seen the `Rockys' and we know nothing about MMA fighting.

There are two ways to view this film, you can be a cynical critic or you can just switch your brain off and enjoy the ride. Critically, there's not much to this film. The plot, such as it is, is obvious & paper-thin, the characterisations are monolithic and the emotional manipulation is as formulaic as the script. However, I don't think this movie had any aspirations for critical acclaim; it is a simple tale of a broken family rediscovering its bonds in the brutal primordial violence of MMA cage fighting. The fight scenes are clearly the entire raison-d'tre for the film and are incredibly well realised - you can't help but get washed away on waves of adrenalin & the testosterone is almost palpable. The non-fighting bits just about hold the film together, despite Nick Nolte's persistent mumbling, and the whole movie does exactly what it set out to do. It's not challenging or thought-provoking but it is hugely entertaining in an obvious sort of way. 7/10 is a fair score; it's not really a four star film but it deserves better than three.",1421452800,,1305,4.576923076923077

Likewise, 90% of the dvds I watch force you to watch scenes, or, at least, snippets/stills from the movie you are about to watch. TO WHAT END?!?! I'm not a preview guy anyway.

4512745,4,B00505QA90,"Warrior is the type of movie that can make you think it's one type of story by looking at a preview or the cover art but provides a distinctly different experience in the viewing.  This is a story about struggles in life, not just between two fighters.  That they happen to be brothers from a very broken family adds tremendous depth that is only more acute by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton's portrayals of their characters.  Nick Nolte is fantastic as their 1,000 days sober dad who caused the initial familial breakup.  The fight choreography is brilliantly executed and looks great on screen.  The only real gripe I have is that the commentary of Sam Sheridan and Bryan Callen is awful during the second half of the film to the point of almost turning it into a schlocky sports film.  Thankfully the acting of everyone else lifts the movie past that.  If you like edgy stories with characters who are unexpected with interesting backstories, you should look this movie up.",1408838400,,973,4.688235294117647

I recommend this product to anyone who loves to have quality and quantity (I love getting Blu-ray, DVD, and digital bundles).

As for the movie... I LOVE IT!!! First watched this back on Netflix and fell in love with the characters and the story. All three of the lead roles are played so well. You'll love the movie from beginning to end, I will say it does take a bit for the action to kick in, but it's worth the wait. Don't write this movie off because it's not nonstop action from beginning to end. I never get tired of watching this movie (was disappointed when it was taken off Netflix, so I had to buy it). If you're a fan of movies that deliver in both drama, story, and the action, this is definitely for you. Don't pass it up, it's not just another fight movie.

Their father, played by Nick Nolte, is a former drunk trying to stay sober and make amends for the actions of his past. What brings them together is a MMA fight with a huge payout.

4512798,5,B00505QA90,"Warrior (Gavin O'Connor, 2011)

That the ending of Warrior is predictable from the moment the two sequences that set up our two main characters have finished is entirely irrelevant to one's enjoyment of this sublime piece of cinema, or at least it should be. Warrior is a simple story, simply told, that is carried on the backs of those two lead characters, and the acting ability of the actors who play them. There are many other things to enjoy about this movie indeed (even if you're not an MMA fan, or even a sports fan in general, and I am living testament to this), but the centerpiece is the perfect performances by Joel Edgerton (The Thing) and Tom Hardy (Inception). Neither of them has carried a major role before; both are usually found in minor supporting roles. I predict that, after Warrior, that will change rapidly.

Edgerton and Hardy play brothers, Brendan Conlan and Tommy Riordan respectively. Both used to be MMA fighters. Brendan, after an ultimatum from his wife following a near-death experience, hung up the gloves and became a high school physics teacher; Tommy did...something else (the unfolding revelation of Tommy's missing years is a major subplot in the film, so saying what would be a spoiler). Their father Paddy (Affliction's Nick Nolte, and I used that 1998 effort to identify him because that's the last time I liked him in a movie this much) is a trainer and recovering alcoholic who, we get the impression, used to be something of a monster. Now all he wants is to be able to atone for his wrongdoings and make up with his kids. However, as Tommy says at one point in the film, the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you. All of which is important, but has nothing to do with the main plot of the film: an entrepreneur has set up a winner-take-all MMA tournament with a five million dollar purse. Both brothers are cash-strapped, and both of them decide to go for it, Tommy under his father's tutelage, Brendan back with his old trainer Frank Campana (End of Watch's Frank Grillo).

The obvious parallel here, to me, is with Wai Man Yip's ridiculous, but fun, 2003 comedy Anna in Kung Fu Land, which I watched a week or so before this without realizing how parallel the two films are; each is about half setup and then half competition (though Warrior spends much more time on character development even during the competition portion), with the same single-elimination winner-take-all tournament style, even with almost the same number of contestants (Anna's competition has fifteen, Warrior's sixteen), leading to a series of battles that expose the strengths and weaknesses of our main characters. The fight scenes are beautiful, the best I've seen since Girlfight, and with a refreshing lack of the ridiculous tendency in fight scenes these days to have slo-mo blood spray as soon as someone gets tapped with a daisy. But it's all leading exactly where you think it is, so if you dispense with the fighting as a draw here, all you have is these characters and the familial drama that surrounds them. And Gavin O'Connor (Miracle), who also co-wrote with Anthony Tambakis (his writing debut) and Cliff Dorfman (Entourage), knocks it out of the park. The family-drama side of the script is impressionist, light-handed, gives just enough to get you filling in the blanks yourself right up until the end (and gives you enough clues that the unanswered questions at the end are easily answerable with a bit of thinking). It's a very risky proposition, especially in a movie where the other half of the action has all the subtlety and impressionism of a sledgehammer to the face. And they pull it off tremendously. As I've stated a time or two, that is in no small part down to Edgerton and Hardy, who show the world that they are both forces to be reckoned with. This is an amazing piece of cinema, ironically one of the best-reviewed (83% at Rotten Tomatoes) and yet least-seen in first run (the movie made back just over half its $25 million budget), movies of 2011. If you were one of the legions that missed it in the theater, do what you must to see it now. It is a phenomenal film. **** ",1397520000,,4181,4.699863574351978

4512841,5,B00505QA90,"""Warrior"" is fantastic.  It is truly one of the best viewing experiences that I have ever had.  It is already one of my favorite films and deserves to be mentioned alongside the all time classics of fight films (i.e. Rocky and The Karate Kid).  In truth, the film exceeds the boundaries of the fight film genre (again - i.e. Rocky and The Karate Kid).  By the end of the film I was thoroughly emotionally invested in the outcome and the ending surpassed my expectations.

The marketing team for this film must have TOTALLY blown it.  I live in Pittsburgh and I was completely unaware of this movie until 2 weeks ago (Warrior came out in 2011 and I am writing this review in 2014).

I just happened upon it because I was searching for the 1970s film ""The Warriors"" and luckily for me ""Warrior"" popped up as one of the search results.  I was going to ignore it but the reviews were so good that I put it in my queue.  I didn't watch the movie for almost 2 weeks.  I may have never watched it (like a lot of people I have lots of movies that I'll probably never watch in my queue).  Then a friend of mine randomly brought ""Warrior"" up in conversation.  He and his son were so enthusiastic about it that I had to check it out for myself.

Whoever was responsible for promoting this movie should hang their heads in shame.  In an online article for this movie it says that the film did not make back its' production budget.  That is ridiculous!  The writing, directing, acting and everything else about this movie is awesome.

""Warrior"" is a gem.  It is a truly great and inspirational film.  I am thankful to everybody that had a hand in bringing this movie to life.",1390348800,,1662,4.355048859934853

Fine directing keeps this film on pace and focused while great acting brings it all together.  Even if you do not like to stomach the violent fight scenes, seeing Nick Nolte's acting is worth the admission to this film.  With minimum lines, Nolte evokes the pain and emotion of a failed father seeking to connect back into the lives of his two alienated sons.

4512853,5,B00505QA90,"This is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Tom Hardy (Tommy Riordan/Tommy Conlan) and Joel Edgerton (Brendan Conlan) give amazing performances as two brothers who have gone their own ways because of family trouble.  Tommy comes off as some juggernaut in the octagon/ring with a whole lot of mystery about his past, but fighting to help support a fallen brother's (Marine) wife and kids, all the while Brendan is basically a washed up fighter who has to get back into the sport to make some money to save his house.

Tom and Joel both did amazing jobs with their roles, but the performance that really blew me away was Nick Nolte's portrayal of Paddy Conlan.  Paddy is an old Marine who used to train Tommy, but was also a serious alcoholic that essentially became the wedge that broke his family apart.  Older and sober, he would now like to reconcile with his sons, but they just can't get find it in their hearts to forgive him for the person he used to be, even though he is the trainer for Tommy.  On a personal note with Nick's role, that I can remember I've never teared up while watching a performance during a movie, but there is one scene that really tugs at the heart strings and I can't help but feel sorry for his character.

This is such a phenomenal movie about love and struggle and it will truly inspire you to want to pursue your goals and not let anything stop you from overcoming adversity.  Rather you stream this online with your Prime membership or you buy the DVD, this is one classic movie that you MUST watch.  Truth be told, I did not have any desire to see this movie, but decided to watch it on a whim with my Prime membership and I am so glad I took the chance.  If you're having second thoughts about this movie, take it from a guy who didn't want to originally see it, it is well worth your time!",1389744000,,1845,4.337209302325581

4512877,5,B00505QA90,"I came across this gem while just channel surfing late one night.  I was very quickly taken in from the very first opening scenes and music.  It just may be the very best independent film I have ever seen.  In my opinion this is how to make a movie and do it all right.  The acting, the plot twists, the emotions, the actions, the music...Even the camera work is superior.  I really don't understand how something like this goes by unappreciated, in fact even unknown to me when some crap like ""Juno"" gets an academy award nomination...

It's truly not too often when something like this about ultimate fighting comes across as to appeal to both women and men.  The man's appeal is apparent with its fighting angle and no holds barred look at the UFC and its bouts violence up close.  The women will enjoy the emotional appeal of the center plots family relationship that consists of an estranged father once again becoming a part of the life of his two sons that are both fighters.  Played expertly by Nick Nolte, a couple of scenes with his sons are some of the most emotionally heart wrenching I have ever seen.  The film starts out strong and never loses a single beat throughout.  Truly a masterpiece in my opinion that deserved much better notice... Don't you miss it... Very highly recommended.. : )",1388793600,,1306,4.562231759656652

It's not your typical action movie; sure there are fight scenes, which are exhilarating, but there is so much more to this movie than that. Nick Nolte does it again, playing a perfect alcoholic, and Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton make the movie incredibly personal. A defining moment in everyone's career that was behind this movie.",1388620800,,496,4.767441860465116

4512882,5,B00505QA90,"Although my son loves the MMA stuff and fighting movies in general, I am not a big fan.  I bought this because I thought he'd like it.  Never thought the darned thing would have me riveted to my seat.  The acting was incredible.  I don't recall seeing Joel Edgerton before, but I'll be looking for him now.  The little I've seen of Tom Hardy (Lawless) I've liked and Nick Nolte has never disappointed.  Tom Hardy played with such anger and controlled rage that you couldn't take your eyes off him.  Joel Edgerton as Brendan really stole my heart, though.  Although his wife (the always watchable Jennifer Morrison) was willing to sacrifice their home to keep him safe, she still supported him and I liked that.  Having a childhood similar to his, though, I could understand the importance of making sure his family had a home and the lenghts he was willing to go to do this.  I could also understand Tommy's reason for fighting and to be honest, I was confliced throughout the whole movie as to which one I wanted to win.  But it ended in the most incredibly sweet and wonderful way.
I don't care if you are a fan of fight movies or not, this movie is probably one you will regret missing.  I know I would have.",1388361600,,1211,4.429864253393665

The notion of a Marine deserter coming home because of how the war was affecting US soldiers gives you a hint as to what was going on overseas.  The twist in the final fight was amazing and ultimately it could have gone either way and I would have been satisfied with the outcome.

Their is some mild language, mild to little blood scene(mostly the fights) and good fight scenes at the mid to end of movie. Their is no sex scene or anything like that, so it's safe. Just mild language and some rough fights. It's pretty realistic to now in days with they whole economy thing, so many may relate to the point if this movie. Hope this helps to any wanting to buy.

4512953,5,B00505QA90,"While this film is not without flaws, it is easy to overlook the few that are there while enjoying the many things that are done well. The basic premise is formulaic; the fighting triumph story you've heard a million times before. However, it is not the fighting, or the triumph that really make this film sing. It's the family dynamics that provide the underpinning and make the build all the more spectacular.

I'm not an MMA fan, or fight fan of any type, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Watched it with my [pacifistic] girlfriend, and she enjoyed it very much as well. Check it out.",1380412800,,590,4.566037735849057

The action scenes are good. What i found likeable was even though this was a fight movie, the fight scences did not over take the film. The story goes far deeper than the fighting. We seem two brothers impacted by growing up with a drunk for a father. The ongoing impact is obvious.

In order to avoid spoiling the end I will not remark.

I highly reccommend this film.",1379376000,,601,4.445454545454545

4512962,5,B00505QA90,"There are some movies everyone knows about and there are some very few know about so you want to show your friends.  This is the latter of the two.  While many have probably heard of it, fewer have actually seen it ...and the ones that have usually love it.

While I found the ending to be exactly what I predicted the journey there was fresh and exhilarating.  Normaly the hero and bad guy of the story is well defined, and movies typically color within the lines.  But this movie paints a story of everyone who deserves to win for a change and by the end you wonder if anyone truly won what they were expecting to win.

It's a great movie with great acting and characters that I liked.  I couldn't tell you who the hero or the bad guy was but I will say the fights are rough ...and I'm not just talking about the fight scenes.

Their are early scenes in the movie where the picture quality shows a lot of fuzz.

4512992,5,B00505QA90,Warrior is an amazing movie. I have watched it twice now and still can't seem to get enough. Tom Hardy's performance is superb. He is mesmerizing. The intensity in which he plays his character is outstanding. The trials of this family are heart-wrenching and made me cry.

4512995,5,B00505QA90,"Life can be brutal, and sometimes those perpetrating the most brutality are those that live right under our own roofs Warrior explores explores the oftentimes brutal world of family relationships, and despite thrilling fight scence that will make you both cheer and punch the air in sheer exhileration; the most brutal scenes were the ones where I could just feel the resentment and unforgiveness that can poison a family's love. And if you've ever been close to someone effected by alcoholism, I garantee an enhanced veiwing experience thanks to Nick Nolte, who is simply great in this film.

To be clear, the movie never forgets its a movie, it builds and paces and thrills its audience with great fights and an amazing feel for explorations of character motivation. I felt the punches and kicks becuase I knew the emotional center from which they were thrown. And in the end, I was pulling for everybody, but I was mostly pulling for redemption and yes, love. There are criticisms to be made of this film, and I'm sure they are well-founded. However, given the hard won emotional core of this film, picking out little faults seems well,  pedantic. Just watch it, then go to the gym and afterwards maybe a 12 step meeting.",1376697600,,1224,4.796208530805687

4513008,5,B00505QA90,"Very believable, credible movie about family angst, life challenges, mixed martial arts (MMA) and integrity. I would recommend it to anyone, with the caveat that there is some graphic violence in the several fight scenes throughout the movie.

Both of the Conlon brothers/protagonists, as well as all of the fighters, looked the part of MMA fighters, and definitely showed some 'moves' that added realism to the story line. The fight scenes were not gratuitous, contributed to propel the plot forward, and underlined the tension and grit of the goals that drove the competitors. They were done very well to capture the brutal, painful essence of fighting for a living, and the very real, inherent dangers of the fight game.

The end was somewhat inevitable, and still it was rewarding to watch to the conclusion, and provided a very good message for ethics and morals in American society.",1375401600,,888,5.034013605442177

4513024,5,B00505QA90,"I bought this movie after reading some reviews; Warrior will not disappoint.  Tom Hardy is an actor to watch.  Hardy portrays Tommy with such under-stated realism and precision that he steals the scenes with Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton.  Not to say that Nolte or Edgerton were less than fantastic in their portrayals as well.  Nolte pulls off Paddy with such finesse that you feel torn as a viewer whether you should betray the other characters and have pity for him or to root for his personal successes and effort.  Edgerton is charming as the caring father figure, living with guilt brother, and underdog fighter.  But Hardy has the most complex character; a quiet powerhouse fighter with a heart of gold, living with an intense sadness and pent up anger.  He is cool in his portrayal, never allowing the cliches to corrupt his delivery.

The premise has some elements of cliche, but the writing, direction, and acting bring this movie out of the mold and create a compelling movie experience.  The story is well built up, drawing the viewer into the characters, and allowing the actors to deliver incredible performances.

The fighting scenes were well selected, not overtly brutal but intriguing.  The movie balances the story line well with the excitement of the fight scenes.  You stay as interested in the characters and their personal victories as much as victories in the cage.

Warrior is a fantastic movie!",1373760000,,1419,4.911764705882353
4513025,5,B00505QA90,"This was a phenomenal movie. When the trailer came out for it I thought it was another cliche brother fighting brother movie but it turned out to be so much more than that. It is the struggle of a family that goes through what so many of us do not. The heartache and struggle from all 3 characters' perspectives is truly moving.

Throughout the movie, for me personally, I felt the most compassion for the father who reminds us that the decisions we choose to make can end up becoming some of the biggest regrets in our lives. He tries so hard to fix his mistakes but it's too late. It's a reminder that should never take our loved ones for granted whether it's our kids, our parents, our siblings, or our friends.

My only complaint for this movie, yes I have one, is that I wish the characters were drawn out more but I understand why they weren't seeing as the movie runs almost 2 1/2 hours as it is. A complaint I initially had was the ending which left things up in the air, but now that I think about it it seems more fitting the way it was.

Excellent movie that brought me to tears and will certainly be watched by me again.",1373760000,,1132,4.231481481481482

Traditionally, my roommates aren't big fans of fight movies, but the story, more than the fights is what is emphasized here. In this heyday of big budget, high action, little-to-no-plot films, the entirety of the action of this movie only serves to focus in on the pains and trials that one family undergoes as it works towards harmony and acceptance.",1373414400,,587,4.385321100917431

The second, and I actually just noticed it, is in the final fight scene. As Edgerton is coming out of his corner in the final round and sees that Hardy is still ready to fight despite his injury, he holds his gloves up to his face and sobs. Just like a little kid would do. Fantastic acting.

I think it does a great job of expressing the type of strong conflict, rage and love that can so often be present between brothers and between sons and fathers. As well, this film speaks to some extent to the great pain and conflict that is typically characteristic within a family that suffered the throes of having had an alcoholic parent (or in this case father). Tom Hardy's depiction of rage is awesome as he demonstrates once again his fine acting skill.

4513042,4,B00505QA90,"I cannot say enough good things about this film. I admit it was Jennifer Morrison that drew me to the movie, but it was the cast and the terrific story that kept me interested. Tom Hardy is very good in the role of the bitter brother and you can tell he really beefed up for the role (he wasn't nearly as big back when he was in Star Trek: Nemesis). Joel Edgerton looks to have moved on his from his Star Wars days and is making a name for himself. He plays the never say die father of two who not only pushes himself to the limit in the ring, but also tries his damnedest to mend old wound between he and his brother.

Nick Nolte plays a sobered up father to both Hardy and Edgerton and gives arguably the best performance of his career. Not to be undone, Jennifer Morrison also gives a solid effort and is a standout in a film that has testosterone flowing through it.

The MMA fight scenes are well choreographed and gritty. They feel very real and you can tell they brought in some people from the world of MMA to make sure they did those scenes justice.

Overall, the film is a great piece of work and I have to say it's a pity that it didn't do better at the box office.

With all that being said, I have to admit I am a little disappointed in the blu ray transfer. I understand a film like this is going to have a little grit in the film and be a little grainy. The problem is, at times, there is so much grain that it detracts from the film's efforts. I expect some grain during night scenes, but in some of them there was so much of it that it was hard to make out certain objects. Even during the daytime scenes where grain usually isn't a problem turned out etched and often felt like there wasn't a huge amount of effort into transitioning this brilliant movie into a format that would do it justice. The sound was alright, but there were a few scenes where I had to adjust the volume to hear all the dialog.

It takes place primarily in a sporting arena and concentrates on one event. Nevertheless it has sufficiently developed characters. Conflict and situations on several points and layers that are enough to draw the viewer in. It succeeds at being identifiable and you are forced to connect with the characters and relate to their simple issues. I would liken it to Boon Dock Saints, Apollo 13 and Million Dollar Baby. Villains change hands quickly as the story teases out the histories of the characters, their flaws and strengths, their relational dynamics and you work out the details.

That's all I have to say about this brutal lovefest, which follows two fighters on the road to ""Sparta""; a multi-day tournament in which the winner gets a whopping five-million dollars to spend on whatever he needs.

The woes of their lives; the financial and psychological misfortunes that are supposed to make us cheer them on; serve as the hook. And the twist; the one and only aspect of the plot that makes it different than all those other fight flicks; is that they share the same father; a former alcoholic abuser trying, unsuccessfully, to mend his past.

The fighting action; the actual in-ring combat; is entertaining and realistic. Ringside commentators make it almost like watching real UFC fights. But the movie's emotional element is anything but tough. So the crowd-pleasing outcomes of those matches are unrealistic and anticlimatic; and clich and predictable; all the way to the scripted end.

He is a very complex character: mostly seemed like a jerk, but great moments of true humanity as well. Obviously he had suffered much. I was also ambivalent about the end: I think that it would have been good to see some ""post-fight"" development of the characters, but I guess that doesn't sell.

4513083,5,B00505QA90,"I don't give too many movies 5 stars, but this is a 5-star sports drama.  It has a great compelling story involving two estranged brothers who through fate find themselves in the same MMA tournament, one fighting for his financial survival and the other out of the bottomless depth of deep bitter anger.  The story is captivating, the acting is first-rate; the fighting scenes are completely realistic, and the direction is crisp and clean.  There are no wasted scenes here; the director has a great scrip, great acting, and he knows what to do with both.  What results is a film that will engage your heart and emotions to such a degree that when the final climactic scenes arrive, you will literally be on the edge of your seat in anticipation.  It is that good.

The casting for this film is a true knockout.  Nick Nolte is superb as the delinquent, alcoholic father of the warriors who is trying to pull together what is left of his life and make peace with his sons.  High praise for both Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy who carry the film on their muscular shoulders and big hearts.  Their fight scenes are as realistic as have ever been seen on film; it is  truly as though one is watching on pay per view.  Kurt Angle, the Olympic Gold Medal Wrestler, makes an appearance as the unbeatable Koba, the Russian  MMA fighter.  His menacing presence lends much excitement to the film.

I certainly do not want to give the impression that this film is just about MMA fighting.  There are multiple layers of dramatic themes that are explored in depth.  If this were just a fight film, it would still be quite good, but the added drama drawn from the compelling story is what makes this film one you will remember and ponder.  I guarantee you will recommend this film to friends.

I've seen a lot of sports movies in my life, but this is certainly in my top-10.  It is truly a gem of a film. It is most likely considered a ""guy"" film, but I believe the ladies will enjoy it as well.  Don't miss this one.

The physical shape these guys got into for the film is incredible.  Make sure you watch the extras on the dvd.  Nick Nolte was very good too, nice to see him in a meaty role.",1363910400,,292,4.052631578947368

What makes this blu-ray worth buying is that it has the digital copy as well a DVD copy of the movie but it has some great extras. And because of those extras you can really see what Gavin O Conner's thought process was and what he hoped to achieve and he himself admits that not everyone might get it but he accomplished what he set out to do. So if you're looking for a great family drama in the MMA world, get it. You won't regret it.",1363910400,,497,4.134020618556701

I'm not beating on Rocky..that was awesome.  The fights are real looking and intense. The two main character are brothers and super hot.  I love Tom Hardy..he played bane in the last batman movie. This movie is about two brothers and the bulls*** they go thur..and the things un said between them. The ending has to be one of the best ending ever!,1363737600,,499,4.9879518072289155

The acting is superb and the storyline is absolutely excellent. My entire family loved this movie and that's really saying something. This movie very quickly earned it's place in my top ten favorite movies of all time. Definitely recommend. As for the blu-ray, this is a quality disc and looks great in 16:10 widescreen. I don't feel the need to own a lot of movies. After netflixing this I had to go out and buy it. Will watch again.",1363478400,,603,4.298245614035087

All the main characters are underdogs fighting for justice but also jerks who used other people to get what they wanted. You may think you know who you're rooting for then you find out something terrible that made that person the warrior you cheer for in & out of the ring.  In end the movie is about fighting to make yourself a better person whether you've made bad choices, had bad luck, or did the right thing only to get knocked down.  You don't have to be a fighting fan to like this heart warming movie about family. Could be the best movie ever",1363478400,,685,4.3858267716535435

I have an interest in MMA, but this movie presents the art of MMA rather than just showing guys beating each other up.  The story line was tremendous, and the acting was excellent.  Edgerton and Hardy became two of my favorite actors right after I saw the entire movie.  Now I will watch any movie in which they appear.  The biggest surprise for me was Nick Nolte.  I have watched him in many roles over the years with only a little interest.  He played his role in this movie, however, very well.  What a pleasant surprise that was.  This is a movie that I watch quite frequently without tiring or skipping over any of the parts.",1363046400,,738,4.2898550724637685

That was a real mistake.  You definitely do not have to be an MMA fan to really enjoy this film.  Both Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy do a great job portraying a set of brothers, each with their own important reasons for needing MMA.  The are part of a family that has had every connection ripped apart, even a shared hatred of their father is not enough to pull the brothers together.  The fist 3/4 of the movie is pretty evenly split between the brothers so that when the inevitable climax happens, you are not sure that there can be a winner or that you even have a rooting interest in the fight.  That is the real mastery of this movie, that there is not one brother that you view as the favorite.  By that point in the movie, you want to root for them both, and you want things to work out for both, but you are not sure that there is any way that this can happen.",1362268800,,1029,3.9611650485436893

A drama with family redemption, alcoholism active and in remission, and twists that lead to one of the most intense dramas and in my opinion the intense MMA is just a huge side benefit. Those seems are incredible. The movie starts out knowing that some of its plot lines are cliche, but blows away the expectation with deeply developed characters. Joel Edergton - Zero Dark Thirty; Tom Hardy - The Dark Knight, Inception (you won't even recognize him, this guy has serious range as an actor,) Nick Nolte (won a number of awards for his supporting role,) Jennifer Morrison (the even hotter Doc from House,) and others.

The plot is well done although it was a bit confusing at first trying to understand why two different UFC fighter's stories were being depicted.
Tom Hardy is an amazing actor. I first saw him in the latest (and possibly worst) Batman movie. His onscreen presence overshadowed Christian Bale's. He carried that movie, I feel, along with Michael Caine...

4513133,3,B00505QA90,"I like this movie, but it is no where near five stars because of several directorial and editing flaws.  Example, when the sportscaster says that Brendan is being thrown like a rag doll . . . well, it is a ""rag doll,"" and it is obvious.  Example, when Brendan is leaving his friend's gym office, the transition from inside to outside the office is very bad.  Example, when Brendan is seen on a monitor screen reacting to the fact that his brother will not quit even though his shoulder is separated, it does not work.  The emotional ride, I think, blinds people to errors that hurt the movie severely.  This could have been a AAA movie, but because of several directorial and editing errors, it is a B movie.  That it is rated 8.2 on IMDB amazes me.",1360195200,,749,4.391304347826087

I think this movie got overshadowed by the Fighter...maybe people thought ""oh just another movie about two brothers that fight..must be mimicking the Fighter.""

What I loved about the movie besides the writing, acting, direction, etc. is that there wasn't a single person shot, or blown up in the movie.  It's been a week since I have seen this movie and I can't stop thinking about it.  This movie isn't really about mixed martial arts it's about a dysfunctional family and what people will do to protect their families or military brother during desperate times.  I thought this was just another boxing type of movie like Rocky but it is so much more than that.  Yes the fight scenes are exciting, amazing and gruesome but it's the dynamic of the family.  The relationship between an absentee alcoholic father and his two sons.  Nick Nolte was nominated for every award for his role as Paddy Conlon (the father).  Joel Edgarton is also amazing.  But british actor Tom Hardy is outstanding.  I cannot say enough about Tom Hardy.  In my opinion he replaced Marlon Brando, DeNiro, etc.  This movie should have been nominated as best picture and Tom Hardy and Joel Edgarton should have also been nominated, not just Nick Nolte.  If a movie can make my 21 year old tough son cry and show emotion both times he saw this movie, then this is one of the greatest movies ever.  Yes this movie does use some standard hollywood cliches but the outstanding writing, acting and direction of this movie totally melts those hollywood cliches completely away.  If you only watch Quentin Tarantino crappy movies then this is not for you.  By the way, QT is one of the most overrated directors in Hollywood.  Guy Ritchie is a much better director than QT.  Snatch was brilliant.  I love the way he directs movies.  I don't need to see someone's face or head actually being shot off.  I can use my imagination.  I wish that Guy Ritchie had directed Pulp Fiction or any of QT's movies.  They would have been 100 times better.  Personally I think QT should just write scripts and leave the directing to actual professionals like Scorsese.  Scorsese never glorifies violence.  He uses violence to do the opposite.  Every violent character in his movies you despise they are never glorified.  He makes the mafia look like serial killing A-holes, which is exactly what they are.  QT 100% glorifies violence.  I have no desire to waste my money on a ""joke"" movie about slavery directed and written by QT.  Truly laughable and a slap in the face to African Americans and what they endured during slavery in this country.  Hollywood would never agree to a ""joke"" movie written about the Holocaust.  It disgusts me that Harvey Weinstein produced this movie.  They are actually making action figures for Django.  Warrior has violence in it but it's NOT gratuitous!!!  This movie doesn't insult my intelligence.  I highly recommend this movie and so does my 21 year old son.  BUY IT!",1357689600,,2850,4.671370967741935

The performances are convincing, compelling, real.  The actors draw you in, especially Nolte and Hardy.  As for the others, I didn't see a weak performance the entire movie, and that, too, is extremely rare.  Finally, each part of the story is believable, so I never had to force myself to ""go along"" with any part of it, and for me, that is huge.  I recommend Warrior, again, and again, and again.

I was most impressed by the acting in this film, particularly Nick Nolte's performance of an alcoholic father of two now-grown men. The scene in the casino with his younger son was particularly powerful--one of the most memorable character scenes I've seen in a long time.

4513181,5,B00505QA90,"Ever since the trailer debuted, I knew I wanted to see this movie.  Warrior is directed by Gavin O'Connor.  He directed another great sports film, Miracle.  In this film, we get not one, not two, but three great performances by very gifted actors.  Tom Hardy (Inception), plays Tommy Conlon, a Marine veteran.  He has just returned from the Middle East and is finding it extremely difficult to live a normal life.  Joel Edgerton (King Arthur) plays Brendan Conlon; a physics teacher and former UFC fighter trying to save his home from foreclosure.  The men's father is played by Nick Nolte; a former alcoholic and terrible father to the boys when they were growing up.  Now the brothers enter a Mixed Martial Arts tournament for redemption, and ironically, to bring their family back together.

What I liked about the film:
The Story

I don't normally explain plot in my reviews, but I have to divulge a little bit here.  The story of the brothers is so good, so intriguing, we're drawn into the film.  At a pivotal age, the brothers are separated due to extreme circumstances (I won't spoil why here).  They each have resentment towards the other, and both resent their abusive, alcoholic father.  But the story is not thrown in your face with flashing lights.  We discover the pain the brothers have gone through in bits and pieces.  All of which comes to light before the finale of the tournament, when the brothers fight each other.  Don't worry, I didn't spoil anything the trailers didn't tell you already.  I also liked how the MMA fighting takes a backseat to the hurt in their hearts.  The best sports films focus on the person, not the sport.

The Acting

Tom Hardy attracted a lot of attention after Inception.  In this film we see a different side of him.  He's angry, bitter and relentless.  But at the same time, he is reserved and in charge.  He walks a fine line between controlled and crazy so well, we never know what he's going to do on screen.  Joel Edgerton has to play a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders.  A mortgage he can't afford, hospital bills, a sick daughter, an absent father and a failed UFC fighter.  His character is the underdog, one that will never quit.  Then there is Nick Nolte, who plays a man trying to get sober.  He's been clean for almost 3 years and is trying his hardest to patch things up with his sons. The three men are riveting.  I was floored by the three men's interactions.  Compelling and entertaining, amazing.

The Action / Cinematography

The Mixed Martial Arts in the movie is nicely shot.  There are some wide shots from the bleachers, as well as up-close, in your face action shots. The character development scenes are nicely shot. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi creates tension with a slightly bouncy camera shot that feels like it's someone eavesdropping on the conversation.  Great stuff.

The Score
I've said it before and I'll say it again; score is so incredibly vital to a movie.  As I've gotten older, I've developed an ear for the score in films.  And one thing I noticed is, score can make or break a sports film.  Mark Isham creates a wonderful soundtrack that evokes tremendous emotion.  The highs are extremely high and the lows are extremely low.  Nicely done.

The Climax

I have been fortunate enough to be blessed with an incredible brother.  He has been my best friend since he was born.  We've lived together as room mates until the day I was married.  And with that being said, we had some great fights throughout our lives.  But there's something about a brother's love that can't be explained.  You can fight and hurt each other, only to make up five minutes later.  The climax of the movie is the culmination of years of pain and suffering by both men.  They both have pent up anger and frustration towards the other.  They are both fighting to move on from a troubled past.  They're both fighting for prize money that will solve their economic woes.  The fight itself, along with the aforementioned cinematography and score create an unbelievable build up to the climax.  I won't give anything away, but I will tell you this; my sold-out theater went from weeping for the characters to literally a standing ovation.  It was so powerful, and so emotionally gripping, it will stay with me for a long long time.

What I didn't like about the film:
The Pacing

I understand pacing and editing are purposefully done (for the most part).  But the first and second act (before the tournament) needed to be touched up a bit.  There are character development moments essential to the build up; however, there are other scenes that needed to be re-cut and sped up.  It is my opinion that these long, drawn out scenes could have been cut down and you wouldn't lose anything towards the overall story arc.

The Verdit:
An amazing metaphor on so many levels

Sports can be a great metaphor for the different struggles in our lives.  The underdog vs. the front runner, picking yourself back up, feeling like we're up against the ropes, etc.  Commentary on the wars in the Middle East, alcoholism, our country's current economic downturn, the housing market and drug use are all touched on in this two hour film.  Give it up to great writers, a great director, terrific acting and a solid story.  It's very VERY rare I see a movie twice in the theaters, but this will definitely be one of them.  Now everyone call your brothers and tell them how much you love them.  Then go see this film with them.",1356220800,,5496,4.648283038501561

There are thousands of westerns but only one ""High Noon"", which uses the well-worn conventions of the western movie and makes a high style, suspenseful film which makes us care about its characters.  The ""Warriors"" is such a movie.  I did not  find the ending ""predictable""; in fact, the story could have led to many different endings without changing the experience much. Very little of the plot tensions were resolved beyond the biggest of all--the reestablishment of the lost family relationships. We do not really know what will happen in the future with the characters' lives; but we feel they will be intertwined again, which is the real ending.",1355875200,,713,4.916666666666667

There is nothing new here - the story is typical, even cliched. One can predict the ending before it happens, and the usual heroes arc from defeat to victor is present.

But everything is doubled! The acting, with the incomparable Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, the brutal fighting (as an MMA student myself, I can tell you this is some of the most realistic fighting I've seen in a film), the story, the emotion, and the characters.

A true triumph from director Gavin O'Connor (Pumping Iron, Miracle - another great sports film), but the real stars are the actors - especially Tom Hardy.

I heard this movie was great, but it was even better than that.  Centering around a father and his two grown sons, all three of whom are estranged from each other, it culminates in the most unlikely scenario.  Recommended for anyone who loves great movies, not just male action-movie fans or UFC fans, especially as a great brothers movie, and, yes, it's also better than ""The Fighter"" (Mark Wahlberg).  Nick Nolte should have won the Oscar for Supporting Actor but unfortunately had to go up against someone who's been in the industry even longer, Christopher Plummer (who won for ""Beginners,"" best known for ""The Sound of Music""); otherwise, the Oscar was his.

FYI: I tuned in to see Tom Hardy, whom I had never seen or heard of until ""This Means War,"" which I found to be extremely funny; I think it got bad reviews b/c it's really a CHICK FLICK that was passed off as being Bond-esque.  In researching Tom, ""Warrior"", kept coming up in reviews as a great movie and earned Nick Nolte an Oscar nom. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy were extremely convincing in character, but Tom has this incredible intensity like Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator.""

4513217,3,B00505QA90,"Warrior is one of the few movies I heard nothing but good things about last year. Most of the people I know with similar tastes to me praised it and put it on their 'best of 2011' lists within the top 10. This surprised me since I'm not used to sports movies getting such great feedback. Sure, I like a lot of sport movies, but I've never seen one that really made me want to go back and watch it again, let alone put it on a top 10, 25, 50 list. I recently gave Warrior a shot once it became available on a certain movie viewing service and, while it held my interest for the most part, it didn't win me over. The movie has some outstanding performances from Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, and some fairly good fight sequences, but for me there was one big flaw, and that was one of the main characters. Warrior is still definitely worth watching- I don't even like MMA or the UFC and here I am recommending it.

We start out with a young man, Tommy Conlon coming back to his hometown and meeting up with his dad, Paddy. This is a huge surprise to Paddy, as he hasn't seen his son in ages. A lot's happened since they last saw each other- Paddy's been sober for almost 1000 days, and now Tommy's looking to start training again. Unfortunately, Tommy lacks the decency to not drink in front of his old man, tempting him with it now and then. Even with this temptation, Paddy takes him in once again. We then meet Brendan, a high school physics teacher who's on the verge of losing his home to the bank. He refuses to file for bankruptcy and resorts to fighting in a strip club parking lot with local guys for a little extra money. Brendan's wife doesn't know about this, as he says he's just working as a bouncer. His luck gets even worse when the school finds out about his fighting, and suspends him without pay for a month. Meanwhile, Tommy becomes an instant internet sensation after a clip of him knocking out a local big shot gets uploaded. With constant training and fights, he's headed for a big event where the grand prize is five million dollars. Brendan, a former UFC competitor, also finds out about the tournament, and we soon learn that he and Tommy are brothers.

...can you guess where this is going?

I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that Warrior wasn't just some dumb fight-fight-fight movie, focusing on dudes getting beat up for 2 hours. The training sequences are well-done, and the beginning fights are over quickly, showing just how fast someone can be taken down, regardless of size or experience. Brendan's past his prime, and the guys he fights aren't exactly on the same page as him, so he's got a ways to go if he's to catch up with Tommy, a former wrestling star and Marine. Of the two characters, I wanted Brendan to win the tournament right from the get-go. He cares about his family having a good home, as well as their financial future. I cared about this character because he's just plain likable. Sure, five million bucks may be a heck of a lot more than he needs for his home situation, but hey, why NOT five million? Tommy on the other hand...well, here's the thing that got me with this movie. I read a lot of comments about both men being underdogs, and viewers not being able to figure out who they wanted to win, because both characters deserved to win. There's no doubting the latter there, but I could not stand Tommy. Arrogant, lacking respect for his father outside of using him as a coach again, not giving Brendan's family a chance when he shows Tommy pictures of his kids, there wasn't anything I liked about him except for one thing. Early on, we find out that he was a military hero, saving a group of his fellow Marines by himself, and also that his best friend was killed. Tommy is now trying to help out his friend's widow and children any way he can, and he wants to win the tournament and give them all of the money. That's a very noble thing to do, and in that sense, I couldn't help but -kind of- want him to win the tournament, but that was only if Brendan didn't come through. The family seems to be doing fine as it is: they're not in some rundown home and struggling for food or anything.

Nick Notle does a phenomenal job as their father, never going over the top with his performance. The last thing I saw him in was Peaceful Warrior (how ironic), and I just might like his character here more but in a different way. Whenever alcohol would be near him, I'd keep thinking ""don't do it!"". The guy's come a long way, and had a tough time dealing with things over the years...it'd be a shame for him to throw away all that hard work. Getting chewed out by both of his boys wasn't any easier to see. A conversation between him and Tommy, where Tommy says, ""where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened"" was especially painful to see and hear, partially because I feel the same way about my dad.

Even at the end of this review now, I'm debating on if I should bump the rating up to 4 stars. Warrior moves along quickly and never feels like it's 2 hours and 20 minutes. There aren't any wasted scenes or annoyingly drawn out shots, fights look very realistic, and Joel Edgerton as Brendan won me over. I just wish Tommy were more fleshed out and the plot weren't so predictable. Warrior's a great weekend choice, or just something to watch if you're sick of watching Rocky for the umpteenth time.",1352505600,6,5470,4.369351669941061

I never heard of the guy who plays his brother in the film, but he is also fantastic.

4513227,2,B00505QA90,"Hollywood made many boxing-themed movies, from ""The Champ"", ""Rocky"", ""Raging Bull"" to ""The Fighter"", all excellent.  There's only one about Wrestling-""The Wrestler"", also good.  Now comes the Mixed Martial Art/UFC-themed ""Warrior"".

After 2 hr 20 min rollacoaster ride of Ultimate Melodrama on films in recent years, I have the feeling that this writer/director seems to have cooked up this unbelievably contrived human story first then tag on this MMA/UFC as an afterthought.

""Spoiler Alert""

2 estranged brothers, both former highschool wrestling champs, 1 a highschool physics teacher facing imminent house foreclosure and 1 an AWOL from Iraq, a substance abuser, who was so devastated as the sole survivor while his close comrade killed by friendly fire.  Both hate their father whom they blamed for their deceased long suffering mother.  Both decided to enter the MMA/UFC fight in Vegas for the $5 million purse with merely a crash course in training.
1 asked his old trainer friend and 1 asked his father(a MMA/UFC trainer?) to get them ready and the 2 brothers ended up facing-off in the octagon(the cage).

Anyone who has seen UFC fights on TV will know those fighters are a dedicated bunch who live and breath for their moments in
the octagon.  This film's fatal flaw is that there is not a moment that is believable about those 2 brothers ended up as the finalists in
the championship fight.  Why would the highschool teacher risk his life and family entering into this extreme sport instead of
downsizing his dwelling?  Why would the AWOL brother be not arrested and instead cheered upon by his platoon(where did they
come from?) and wanted to win the $5million to be given to his comrade's widow?  For counter balance, the highschool teacher was cheered upon by his students!  Even the reactions of the highschool teacher's wife was confusing.  First, she wouldn't dare to
answer her phone about the news of her husband's fight.  Next moment, she's at the ring side cheering him on.  The first hour of
the film, the filmmaker used unnecessary cross editing and multi-screen format to enliven the film tempo.  The gym trainer showed
up at the father's doorstep was shown twice for no reason whatsoever.

The acting of the 3 leading actors was servicable, considering the script and the direction.  Joel Edgerton gave a more heart-felt
performance.  Again, the much lauded Tom Hardy did not have much to do other than showing his anger and pain.  As for Nick
Nolte who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, he seemed to be under-directed most of the time and looked like he'd down
a bottle of scotch in the first secene in the hotel room while in the immediate next shot he seemed to have slept off.
Finally for the most important part, the fights, were choreographed and filmed with little excitment.

Why would anyone give this film 5 star is beyond me.",1351209600,2,2869,4.908713692946058

I wasn't disappointed, although the typical fight movie plot was only barely in evidence.  Instead, I got a well-acted movie with a fantastic story about a broken family that might almost come together again.  Everyone one of the characters is portrayed with depth.

4513240,2,B00505QA90,"The story started off pretty good but got more and more unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous at the end.  The acting and dialogue were good, especially Nick Nolte.  But the melodrama got so thick at the end I could barely stand it.  It also started to get tiresome listening to Tommy grunt and snarl at everyone all hunched over like a cave man.  And, what a surprise, he turns out to be a war hero who never took credit for saving someone's life so the whole crowd is cheering for him.  That by itself...yea, okay; but added to all the other unbelievable stuff; no.  If the writers had consulted a group of high school boys, they probably would have recommended that.  Then how the fight turned out in the end: could it have even been attempted to make it more dramatic and moving?  What else could have been thrown in there to aim for a higher crescendo to make it by far the very most dramatic sports movie of all time--since that seems to have been what they were aiming for?  Maybe the other guy's daughter could have been taken hostage and he has to win to save her life, but at the same time Tommy actually had organ damage and would die if he was hit again.  Sound pretty good?  I mean, that would be even more dramatic right, and more dramatic is better.  This movie could have been good all the way through if the writers had shown a little bit of restraint, but they didn't.  It is possible to overdo something so that it just becomes dumb, and despite the good elements of this film, it could not have been much more overdone in the end.",1348876800,,1558,4.312714776632302
4513241,5,B00505QA90,"I knew nothing about this movie going in. I don't watch TV anymore, so I don't see trailers on a regular basis. Only if I go searching for them online. I'm not usually into movies like this...referring to the type of violence. I don't like boxing. I mean, I can watch movie fighting, I'm not that sensitive, it's just not what I prefer. So, you might be wondering why I even watched it in the first place. Well...I have to be honest. It was because of Tom Hardy. I just think he's an amazing actor. He's like Daniel Day-Lewis plus Robert DeNiro and maybe even a dash of Lawrence Olivier thrown in for good measure.

I watched Bronson a couple of years ago, and I thought if I can sit through that for Tom Hardy, surely I can watch this movie. If you haven't seen Bronson, you won't know what I'm referring to. Not that it was very much like this movie, just that the character he plays is violent and angry and well, kinda crazy..okay, well, a lot crazy.

The character he plays in this movie isn't exactly crazy, but he is angry. I don't want to give anything specific away about the movie, but I'll just say his character has issues.

Well, I'm glad I gave it a chance, because I ended up liking it a lot. Yes, there are fight scenes that made me not want to watch, but I didn't exactly sit here with my eyes covered. The fighting, I thought, was realistic, not over-done or gratuitous. I found myself wanting certain things to happen, or characters to say what I thought they should say, but it was okay that they didn't. It makes it more real when it's not all tied up with a neat little bow. And that's what makes great story-telling.

And it is the story here that hooks you. I didn't even think of not finishing it. The script was excellent, and the acting superb. Nick Nolte's character was painful to watch, but Nick's performance was wonderful. I realized after it was over that Tom Hardy's character didn't really have much dialogue, but you don't notice that as you're watching. Joel Edgarton was awesome, and I thought Jennifer Morrison (who currently plays Emma in the TV series Once Upon a Time) who plays his wife here, was perfectly cast. She was just right.

It's hard to find a movie that brings it all together so well and makes you feel like it was time well spent. I felt that this really was one of those movies. Just good entertainment.

I read a bunch of reviews before I watched it, and I felt kinda let down for about the first 2/3 of the movie.  I was thinking that it was okay, but not great.

That said, there doesn't ever need to be another MMA movie, the acting was so strong in this one; I wanted to love it, but it was sabotaged in various places and became a Stallone-ish meatheaded, moralistic travesty with a unbelievably reactionary conclusion.

(spoilers follow) Plot typology of principle characters

The unknown quantity (Tom Hardy) turns out to be a war hero, whose medal of honor feat of physicality becomes a viral video, leading to the realization that he was in the process of going AWOL after a friendly fire bombing run blew away his entire unit, him being the sole exception. He will be taken into custody after the conclusion of the tournament and court marshaled.

Universal nice guy (Joel Edgerton) has refinanced his mortgage twice (daughter's heart condition) and is facing bankruptcy or foreclosure. In his youth, rather than move with his kid brother and ailing mother and assume a George Baily man of the house role (It's a Wonderful Life), he remains in-town to: 1.) get training from his father denied to him when Hardy's character was around 2.) marry his high school sweetheart. Turning the corner at 30, the has-been all around failure returns to MMA to make ends meet, subsequently losing his position as a highschool physics teacher; he is a New England Walter White of Breaking Bad minus 15 years, in his own way.

Deadbeat absentee alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) has cleaned up with AA and finds younger son on his porch. His overtures at reconciliation vacillate between hopelessly self-pitying and pathetic, and vicious ambition.

Review and Analysis by principle characters

Hardy's darkness, the war, is completely glossed over. From his first take down of Mad Dog Grimes in the gym sparring match onwards, it had to be clear that he does not care if he kills his opponents in the ring and that that is perhaps what he aims for. Hardy represents the socioeconomic/moral blowback of the other two's actions as well as those of society (the war, the banking shenanigans). The film ends with a fraternal reconciliation offered as a memory hole cover for predatory housing loans, bailouts, war, desertion charges and personal betrayal.

The financial compulsion/desperation of Edgerton is not felt acutely enough; the foolish vanity of not declaring bankrupcy is not utilized/explored nor the strain on the marriage made manifest by it. His idolization by his students also marks him for an Icarus-fall with them as witnesses. Edgerton's character is not a credible master tactician cum Rocky, who overcomes his physical disadvantages by biding his time. The triumph of Edgerton's huberis is the principle dramatic and moral failure of the film.

Nolte's character has the least flawed writing and the only fully developed character in the film. The Nolte-Hardy dialectic is masterful and correctly done (he HAS to relapse, and does Hardy holds the mirror up to him), but the Nolte-Edgerton relationship was not maintained by his resentment against his father for not being the favorite son as much as was required; ""I've forgiven you Dad, -but I don't trust you."" As Hardy notes on the beach of the Sparta event, ""You're full of s*** man, I feel sorry for you."" Edgerton -the sensitive reflective guy- has the biggest chip on his shoulder of the three with the most to prove and never realizes it.

The gains of having Edgerton's character come out on top (the son most like his mother gives the alcoholic father's favorite son a beat down and the father as well by proxy) are so grossly outweighed by other plot dimensions/possibilities that their merits are not worthy of enumeration here. Edgerton represents the American Dream as is currently understood today. His victory in the film serves the maintenance of this set of lies: Warrior is a propaganda film.

""I didn't even get to say goodbye to her, my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me."" -Actually, Conan O'brien look-alike, you surrendered that right in order to chase after you Dad's approval and to become a teenage dad which put you in the economic hole you're in now; you chose your father over your dying mother and kid brother.

4513268,5,B00505QA90,"Warrior is a sports drama about two brothers entering a MMA tournament to earn $5,000,000; we also see their difficult relationship with each other and their formerly alcoholic father play out.

Warrior has amazing performances from both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton. The conflict between them plays out very well because of how great they play their characters. The MMA fight scenes are realistic and exciting; Tom Hardy is especially vicious in his scenes. What I really liked about the film was how it changes the sports movie formula. Most sports films have one underdog athlete that ends up winning. This film has two; it made me question who i was rooting for and why? The ending was great, brilliant acting, it has amazing music, and a heartfelt story.

Overall, I highly recommend watching Warrior. As of 8/8/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also highly recommended.

I was won over by the individual characters and the three Conlon men.  Every actor was effective and believable. Hardy and Edgerton gave it more than anyone I know could have to physically transform.  But Tom Hardy killed it as Tommy Conlon.  You can read any other item description, but take this with you:  if you want to be moved by realistic emotions, actions, and reactions, you will win with this movie.  Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte were brilliant.  Hardy deserved some serious awards for his performance.  Watch the special features so you can see what these men put themselves through to bring their characters to our attention. I am back in the gym because of these guys.  Thank you!

I was recommended this movie, by another Amazon reviewer, who had suggested this was better than ""The Fighter"" (I was looking at seeing that movie). The reviewer gave this movie high marks, and said it was worth a few. Boy, they weren't kidding. Knocked my socks off!
The story follows two men, who live in very different worlds, when they decide to enter the same contest for a cash prize (with very different reasons for doing it). Turns out the guys are brothers, with a broken relationship.
First, the things I didn't like. The beginning, the first 1/3, was slow in parts, bad pacing and development of the story.
Now, the things I did like. I fracking loved the gritty feel, the camera work, the directing. I loved that they didn't have a bunch of ""big names"" (I mean who wants to deal with having to sort Skittles and ""back end"" promises). I loved the actors, they did a great job. And the last 1/3 was phenom! Seriously.
The Director, also co-wrote it, partially his idea, and co-produced it. I give him big Kudos! Well done! I hope the Hollywood system doesn't ruin him (like it has with a bunch of other talented people) and hope he stays true to himself.
I would not only buy this, I would watch this movie, over and over again.
It's a rare to watch a movie that leaves you feeling like you can conquer the world!",1342656000,,1544,4.459363957597173
4513272,5,B00505QA90,"I really enjoyed this story of a family who is reconciled through violence.  The story is well wrought and gritty yet not raw in an oppressing manner.  The characters are believable, like a slice of hard life.  The acting was excellent.  The director Nolan mentions just how talented Tom Hardy is at acting through his eyes, especially conveying the emotion of unbridled rage.  The actors also got into a peak physical condition to help make the fighting scenes seem real.  The film fits together quite well and the climactic ending is pretty emotional.  One would have to be a savage not to be moved by the reconciliation.  I also liked the Moby Dick undertones through the Father who listens to the tapes.  There is also some insightful writing.  I especially liked the comment of the principal who after the main character teacher says ""C'mon it's not that bad.""  The principal replies, ""Do you mean that literally or figuratively?  Cause literally it looks bad, and figuratively it looks even worse.""  So the principal (or rather the writer of the movie script) wisely discerns that one expression or one word may assume both literal and figurative meanings.  Literally the face of the teacher was injured bad and looked bad.  Figuratively the face of the teacher was even worse because of the bad example or scandal he set for his students and the school public.  Good writing!  The training scene was also excellent with some good music to get you psyched up for your training sessions.  Definitely a Mans Man movie.",1342310400,,1522,4.833333333333333
4513273,5,B00505QA90,"Whoever was in charge of promotion of this movie should have been fired. It's a shame it didn't get more attention. I am happy that Nick Nolte got an Oscar nomination, he deserved it. Warrior is a story of two brothers and a recovering alcoholic father who have to find a way to forgive each other as well as themselves. The title is bad, and the premise has been done many times before, but it's still very much worth watching as the characters are very real. What I love most about this movie is that even when it seems so easy to cast blame, the truth of the matter is that people are people. They are flawed and messy and foolish and scared and can still be worthy of love and forgiveness.

Most people in America don't know who Tom (Tommy, the younger brother) Hardy is (even if they did see Inception), but they will soon (he plays Bane in the upcoming The Dark Knight Rises). I've been following his work and his talent is pretty remarkable. I can only hope that his career will be steady and consistent and incredibly long lasting. I also hope he doesn't become some over exposed, weird, untouchable uber star that people get sick of once they discover how talented and ""hot"" he is. It's for my own selfish reasons, as soon as Hollywood decides someone is ""the next big thing"", it seems they work to destroy him/her as soon as the novelty wears off (even though he's been acting for at least ten years). I hope he's around for a long time. After you watch him in this movie and a few others (Stuart, a life told backwards, Wuthering Heights, Rock n Rolla, The Take) you'll hope so, too.",1341964800,4,1594,4.385135135135135

Let me put it like this:  I love this movie so much that I made a vow to support any film that Tom Hardy plays in from now until the apocalypse.  e.g. I willingly purchased two tickets for, and sat through, This Means War.",1340841600,2,518,4.34375

The only reason i got it at first was because i needed a 4th DVD for blockbuster's 4 for 20$ deal (sometimes if you're lucky its 5 for 20$) So i was desperate to get any DVD to complete the deal and had no idea this movie would turn out to be one of my favorites EVER! That may seem like a big thing to say, but this movie really does have it all. I was completely surprised by how good the story was, how great the acting was, and how i could keep going form start to finish in one sitting. (and its not exactly a short film haha) Heres what you get from this movie:

Tom Hardy is now one of my favorite actors, the way he portrays Tommy is full of emotion and dedication to what he wants to do. You end up cheering for him even though he plays a guy with an attitude. Whats great about this film is that you can relate to pretty much ANYONE. For anyone who has had problems with paying for their home bills, Joel Edgerton who play's Tommy's brother in the film does a fantastic job as a father who is desperate to make a life better for his family. You really end up relating to the brothers in their own way.  And when it comes to knowing how to draw your attention in Nick Nolte does an AMAZING job as the father of the two brothers (in my opinion he should have won the Oscar for best supporting Actor but WHATEVER) From there the movie really picks up, showing great shots of city streets as they train for an upcoming martial arts tournament as well as what the MMA media world really looks like with fighters from all over the world coming together. As for the ending i defy you to try and not feel any emotion, but thats all I'm going to say.

This movie is worth your money, If you get it for 5 dollars or even 20 at a Best Buy or something. The acting is fantastic, and the characters really actually feel like real people. Thats what movies struggle with to get my attention, i like to actually feel like I'm in the movie, not just staring at a screen for 2+ hours. Rent this movie if you must just to be sure, but you will enjoy it. Fantastic job and i commend everything that went into making this movie.

Well, this was one of the best movies of last year.  I was so surprised how well this story was written, directed and acted.

Go through and read the Professional critics movie reviews, tv stations studios and big time NY sources put this Movie aside from the Sports wow and mix it with instant Classics like Avatar, Goodfellas, and the Lord of the Rings (1,2) - big time arguable classics, all movies that got cut short of a historical big time Oscar.

4513281,5,B00505QA90,"I really loved this movie, yes it was like every other sporting movie that was ever created, and yes all of the MMA fights were pretty basic and the fantastic moments were incredibly unlikely, but it still works incredibly well. The soldier brother always knocks his opponents out in the first minute of the fight, and the teacher brother is always beat up for the whole fight until pulling off an amazing submission right before the fight ends. I mean, yes this does happen in MMA fights, but it felt pretty contrived in the movie. The action (beyond the believability) was very well done, however it was kind of annoying how often the director liked to cut to people watching the fight, but I understand it's meant to instill emotion into the action.

The reason this movie is one of the best sports movies ever made is because of the actors and the script. All of the main characters are incredibly deep, and the emotion in their confrontations go all the way through the screen to your heart. They're all damaged goods, but it just makes them painfully human. In the end, you can't help but wonder what will happen to these characters after the credit rolls. I really loved this movie, and everyone should set aside a few hours to watch this, even if you aren't an MMA fan.

4513284,4,B00505QA90,"Acclaimed director Gavin O'Connor (MIRACLE) does the incredible AGAIN. Warrior is about two brothers who enter a mixed martial arts fighting competition, SPARTA, in order to win the world championship prize of $5 Million dollars. The youngest brother, Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy), who went AWOL from the Marines, intends to give the prize money to his deceased military friend's widow and children.  Tommy physically resembles the Incredible Hulk with a monster body and raging anger. The oldest brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a high school physics teacher, ex-fighter, and husband/father, needs the money to rescue his family home from foreclosure. Brendan breaks a solemn promise to his wife (Jennifer Morrison) that he would never fight again and this adds marital tensions on top of their financial woes. Brendan is the underdog at SPARTA because he is unknown and has a lightweight athletic build compared to Tommy and other star athletes.

Tommy harbors childhood animosity towards Brendan because Brendan left home to runaway with his girlfriend (now wife) at the age of sixteen, leaving Tommy alone as a little scared boy to take care of their dying mother. Brendan was unaware at the time when he jumped the family ship that their mom was sick with cancer. Before the brothers square off in the ring, Brendan asks Tommy to let bygones be bygones.  Brendan even tries to show his wallet-size happy family photos to Tommy but Tommy's bitter response is that he doesn't have a brother. While the emotional fire blazes between the two brothers, their recovering alcoholic father, played by Nick Nolte, pleads with both for forgiveness and a second chance at reestablishing a father-son bond.

Warrior exhibits remnants of Rocky by separately showcasing both brothers getting into mental and physical shape. Tommy is trained by their veteran father but defiantly decides the what, when, where, and how of the training. Go figure. Brendan trains humbly in the shadow of eye candy jaw dropping star athletes and they are all being coached by his friend-trainer (Frank Grillo) known for incorporating classical music into training techniques.  Tommy advances up the competition ranks with Mike Tyson-like one-jab knockouts.  Brendan beats his opponents with mind-over-matter endurance after tiring them from several rounds. When Tommy and Brendan finally compete, one side of the arena is filled with Tommy's military colleagues cheering him on, while on the sidelines, the police await to arrest Tommy for military desertion.  As for Brendan, the typical Hollywood scene shows him noticing his wife in the arena crowd giving him the ""I love you, I support you"" smile. Brendan makes one last plea to Tommy to call off the fight but Tommy turns deaf ear.  The audience is left to see who will win as the toughest man on the planet.

Warrior is not a typical guy fight flick. This intense action drama sizzles with raw emotion. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton light the screen brightly with superior acting performances. Both draw your sympathy and frustration equally in their respective roles. The pace of the movie was with lightning speed never leaving a lull spot. Let me not forget the resurrection of Nick Nolte.  He too made a promising comeback. Warrior had two drawbacks.  The first drawback is that with every fighter having a pretty baby face, no one was ugly or scarred from the heavy beating from fighting, and this seemed unrealistic. The second drawback is the ending. While it could have been less Hollywood (the two brothers walk out of the fight hugging each other), the ending may have been designed for a Warrior sequel. Due to the violence, it is not a family movie per se, but it is a movie that has several lessons for families to learn from. All in all, Warrior is definite must-see.",1336953600,,3803,5.030206677265501

I don't want to get into spoilers so I will keep it vague.  The cast of actors across the board was great, from sports announcers to the fighters.  I have to mention that Nick N., Tom H., and Joel E. delivered great performances as well as the supporting cast.  The plot is not something you find in movies which made predicting the movie impossible.  As a finishing touch, the music fit nicely in getting the viewer into the right mood for the scenes instead of detracting from it.  Overall, Warrior is a great movie.  If you're unsure, try renting it first because more than likely you will want to own it afterward or at the very least watch it again.

Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) returns home after fighting in the war against Iraq.  He has changed his last name to his deceased mother's maiden name and he goes by to see his father.  His father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) was an alcoholic and abusive husband and father.  Tommy ran away with his mom 14 years before to get away from the torture.  Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) stayed behind as he had a girlfriend and he wanted his father to pay attention to him now that his favorite Tommy was gone.  They all grew up hating each other for many reasons!

Tommy joins a local gym and quickly volunteers to fight the number one contender for the World Martial Arts middleweight belt!  In 20 seconds the fight is over and Tommy has completely destroyed the contender.

Brendan is about to go bankrupt and lose his home as they are buried in medical bills from his youngest daughter's heart ailment.  He and his wife are working three jobs to still become further behind in debt. Brendan hasn't told his wife that he is street fighting again as he can make more money in one night than he can in a month on a second job.

A billionaire promoter sets up a cage Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) gala titled Sparta!  Both brothers make it into the group of 16 scheduled fighters and are quickly considered underdogs.  Tommy is the brute and brawler and Brendan is the finesse and tactician style of fighter....

I cannot express to you how good this movie is.  It makes every fight movie you have ever watched pale by comparison to this movie.  The actors did a wonderful job depicting their characters and I really enjoyed this movie.

Not only are the fights good but the storyline about the family and their relationships is well written and acted out.  This is a dramatic drama about a family perhaps finding some solace in each other after many years of hatred and isolation!

4513293,5,B00505QA90,"Outstanding movie! This was a great surprise.

As a ""fighting movie"", it was refreshing to see true depth to a story outside of the ring in parallel to the one taking place inside. The acting was phenomenal by Edgerton, Hardy, and Nolte, though Hardy stole it for me (this guy is amazing). The music was right on cue and fit the scenes. The fight scenes were good enough get out of my seat and cheer. The drama was masculine, a bit dark, and cauldron deep.

I love that there was NOTHING gratuitous or cheap in this movie. In a day where movie makers try too hard to appeal to all demographics and end up cheapening what could have been a great movie (Transformers), this sets a new bar for balance. The fight candy only enhances the drama, and vice versa. I saw little in the way of compromise in either. With a strong story and good actors, you really don't need CGI, sex, F-bombs every other word, etc.

To beautifully wrap up a great movie, the two stories fully converge in THE MOMENT. It is in the final fight and is the true climax of the movie. As a man, that moment is unmistakable, unforgettable, and unbelievably powerful, because it was impossible not to be strongly sympathetic to the characters by that time. It was expertly built up and served to make the fight become progressively gut wrenching and sad as we recognize what winning will actually cost the other. Though, unfortunately, losing still did not seem to be an option, given the noble reasons both were supposed to be fighting for in the first place.

I also saw the last fight as a culminating metaphor for life. The message relating to how much of our pain and anguish is self inflicted, though many of us still double-down in treading our path alone and on our own terms, notwithstanding our misery. Eventually there comes a point where we may recognize that the true cost of ""doubling-down"" is actually greater than ""tapping-out"" (conceding, forgiving, repenting). In such a moment of great fear and vulnerability, we need someone to comfort us, someone to make it ok to let go. Only then can we see that true ""victory"" (peace, joy - whatever that may mean to us) was never to be found alone. For this reason, the fight was absolutely necessary to complete the story. This is also why I think most viewers, including myself, at least got ""a bit choked up"" in this scene.

It is not every day that you see a profoundly counterintuitive spiritual principle masterfully captured by a ""fight movie"", or any movie for that matter.

I hadn't even heard of this movie until yesterday. Lucky me!
Lucky you, if you watch it.",1335744000,,2595,4.581896551724138
4513294,5,B00505QA90,"I'm not going to go over the same ground all the other reviewers did, just say that if you can hear everything that's said the first time through, good for you. If, like me, half of it was illegible, you'll miss a lot of the things that make the plot work and hint that characters have made progress. The performances are spectacular to a man so the acting strength made me rewatch it and this time I turned on the subtitles and caught a lot more. Just a suggestion: it's definitely underwritten, and the characters stay somewhat stock but the acting blows it all away anyway. Karate Kid for adults, with a serious family drama interwoven. Somehow this odd chemistry works.
One more thing that really bothers me about nearly every review and plot description I've seen. This is NOT the Tom Hardy Show. Yes, he's brilliant. But it's Joel Edgerton's movie. His character is the lead, the main focus and the only sympathetic person in the thing. His story is the main storyline and the tale that holds the entire show together so don't go in thinking it's all about Hardy. It's not. Edgerton's Brandon is the focus and the follow-through and the heart. Hardy is the broken-to-the-point-of-psychotic mess he plays so well.
Speaking of which, I wish someone would let him play something without blood on his teeth....
Update: just have to add that this has turned out to be my favorite film of that year. I find I rewatch it all the time and it's never boring, never dull. It's melodramatic and very unsubtle, so this is a bit of a surprise to me but I think it's fabulous.",1335571200,,1568,4.5638297872340425

4513296,4,B00505QA90,"Here's a review I never dreamed I would write, for three good reasons: 1) I don't like blood sports. 2) I avoid sports clich&eacute;s. 3) I'm not fond of Nick Nolte. I don't think I would have liked this 2011 movie quite so much if I hadn't watched the extras on the DVD. They provided some insight for a rabid MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) non-fan (ME!), which helped get me past the blood and the pain those folks inflict on one another and try to understand the underlying skills. Sorta like football: Two teams of over-grown hulks pummeling each other into hamburger, but there IS some skill involved, right?

Sooooo... Bottom line: 1) I still don't like blood sports. 2) Clich&eacute;s become clich&eacute;s because on a very basic level, they work. 3) I still don't like Nick Nolte. But the wrenching final match stayed with me long enough to warrant a review for Amazon.com.

We have a pair of brothers. When they were children, one split with Mom when the marriage broke up, the other stayed with the alcoholic father. Neither had an easy time of it. Now, one is a returning Marine vet, the other is a physics teacher with a wife and children. Through a series of clich&eacute;s, they both end up back in the MME cage, fighting their way toward the championship. By the time they have come this far, we want BOTH of them to win!

We have:
  * Nick Nolte (""Three Fugitives"") Let's get him out of the way first. He hits all his marks and delivers the goods, I just don't like the goods he delivers. You know, the contrite former alcoholic who is really, really sorry. I agree with his sons: Talk is cheap, but the damage is done. We can't un-ring the bell here, folks!
  * Tom Hardy (""This Means War"") is the former Marine. The American accent used by this British-born bloke convinced me he was from Pittsburgh! This war veteran seethes with hostility and rage: perfect for the MMA cage!
  * Joel Edgerton (""Kinky Boots"") no trace of Down Under in this guy's American accent either! His character is sweet, a much-loved high-school physics teacher with a loyal wife and two sweet little girls.
  * Jennifer Morrison (""Star Trek"" 2009) is that loyal wife. She understands the very real danger her husband is exposed to and does NOT want another ride in an ambulance!
  * Frank Grillo (""The Grey"") is a long-time family friend and coach who knows the family dynamics at play here. He has a good reason why Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" is the entrance music for his fighter.

There is a lot of showmanship involved in MMA matches and this movie manages to capture it. Luckily the matches only bookend the REAL issues at stake here and both of the lead actors are skilled enough to capture our attention and our allegiance, to the point that we actually CARE what happens in the cage.

It was that last round that got me!",1335139200,4,2815,4.546534653465346

4513302,5,B00505QA90,"There's not one negative thing I can possibly say about this film.  Not a single one.  Warrior is perfectly cast and perfectly acted with a beautifully told story that plays out with spot on perfect pacing.  ""Warrior"" is quite possibly a ""PERFECT"" movie in all respects if that sort of thing even exists in Hollywood any more.  It tells a compelling story that you're immediately drawn into with enough back story on the characters for you to completely invest in them.  Take Tom Hardy's character for instance.  The guy comes off as totally abrasive and really unlikable-yet at the same time, you understand completely why he is the way he is and you don't fault him for it.  You understand him.  Nick Nolte's character on the other hand-knowing his past and what a horrible man he must have been makes him sort of despicable.  Yet one cannot help but feel sympathy for him in his tough journey to become a better man even though his son's have written him off and will forever see their father as a monster without possible redemption.  Joel Edgerton's character (my favorite of the trio) has his own problems to deal with and though he is the most grounded, also suffers from a deep mistrust of his father and an estrangement from his brother.

""Warrior"" is just an all out excellent film that gives you something to believe in, something to cheer for and will absolutely make you feel something.  I challenge any man alive to watch this film and not get choked up at one scene or another.  It strikes a man on so many levels in a way that's honest and heart felt.  Last year, the film ""The Fighter"" garnered so much oscar love and attention.  ""Warrior"" blows ""The Fighter"" away in every category in my opinion.  It's just an outstanding movie all the way through and for two solid hours just takes you into the lives of these three men you can totally relate to and root for.  Don't miss this one.  This movie is absolutely outstanding.  This should have hands down won the Oscar for best picture this year (criminally it wasn't even nominated).  At least Nick Nolte earned a nomination though for best supporting actor though and rightfully so.  Incredible!",1332979200,7,2162,4.636842105263158
4513303,5,B00505QA90,"I really liked Gavin O'Connor's MIRACLE. It was a very good film about a very inspiring story. But the only issue that I really had with that film is that it was a little too reliant on the nostalgia factor to get its point driven home. WARRIOR doesn't suffer from that. This is very much a film set in the here and now, and that gives it more immediacy in regards to the world its set in. Edgerton's character is on the verge of losing his house and the prize money is the only thing that can save it. Hardy (who, along with Michael Fassbender, is one of the hardest-working men in showbiz) is a man with a mission. His mission is very single-minded and anyone in his way is merely an obstacle. But what makes this tale so much more vital and what makes these adversaries so compelling is their famililal bond. When you have a film like this, you generally have a clear hero and a clear villain. Edgerton seems more heroic in his underdog, can-he-or-can't-he tale, and Hardy seems more villainous with his rock-solid body, crushing blows and his anger constantly near his surface.

When you cut below the surface and get to their intent, you can see that both of them deserve to win this tournament, and that both of them have similarly honorable reasons for fighting. The great thing about this film is that it never forces you to take sides. You care about both Edgerton and Hardy, and that's a very difficult thing to pull off in a film like this. Nick Nolte, surprisingly to me, was a tiny bit of a weak link in this film, not so much because of his performance, but because his character, the formerly drunk and abusive father and grizzled veteran trainer who, after losing everyone, turns his life around into sobriety and constant apology... the character is far too much of a trope in this genre of films. It was the only part of the film that felt a little false to me.

Otherwise though, WARRIOR, with its terrific performances, smart storytelling and its suspeneful atmosphere as it builds towards its inevitable conclusion and the raw emotion and physicality of the final fight just drains you and makes this similar to FIELD OF DREAMS as kind of a ""chick flick"" for guys. Yeah, I cried. Wanna make something of it?",1332633600,,2228,4.52605459057072

4513305,5,B00505QA90,"I just saw warrior on Saturday night I think and yes I almost cried during the final scene. Rarely in film do you see such a powerful mix of awesome fighting and legitimate acting. Its as if they wrote a movie for Vin Diesel and Paul Walker but instead decided to cast real actors. Rarely do I see a film where upon finishing it I immediately watch the final scene again. Rarely do I stand up and cheer in my home during a movie. Rarely do movies teach such powerful lessons like - never tap out until your opponent says ""I love you."" I'm a little hesitant to say this but I think Fast 5 has just taken a step down the list of my favorite movies of 2011. Warrior is now number 1.

It does deserve credit for bucking convention in a few ways, particularly in building to the inevitable finale with two potentially viable results. Typically the happy ending writes itself halfway through the picture and then just goes through the motions to get us there: in Warrior, we follow both perspectives for the whole of the film and either outcome would make for an appropriate, warm ride into the sunset. The fight scenes are fun, if highly exaggerated, takes on an in-vogue sport; it's about as realistic a portrayal of mixed martial arts as Rocky and The Replacements were to boxing and pro football. Nick Nolte deserves special mention for grizzling up and embracing his inner Burgess Meredith, but I didn't see anything above and beyond from leading men Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton.",1331510400,,937,5.171052631578948
4513310,5,B00505QA90,"Make no mistake, Warrior is what I refer to as The Perfect Friday Night Movie: Get a pizza in (preferably thin crust!)wipe your HDTV screen clean, and stick on the blu-ray. For a ridiculously touched-up poster, Warrior didn't have to convince me to see it; the fact Tom Hardy has been referred to as the British Marlon Brando is the reason. With the exception of Christian Bale, I absolutely detest The Fighter: It's riddled with more Irish-American cliches than Far and Away and is oh-so annoying at the best of times. You can understand my trepidation as I waited for this drama to unfold.

As ""Tap 'em Out"" Tommy Reardon, Tom Hardy is massive. The guy's traps are enormous (he's gigantic!) and given his turbulent performance, one can only wet themselves at the prospect of seeing him kick Batman's ass in The Dark Knight Rises. He spends much of his time brooding,looking mean and makes a great effort with his US accent (which I am assuming is an amalgam of regional US dialects or do the good people of Pittsburgh talk like that?) He makes taking a swig of whiskey seem like an art form and can understand why his character has no sense of ambition any more, which is revealed through a surprise twist, midway. And Mr Hardy is that rare thing since Gary Oldman: He's scary and unpredictable. Tom's dual role not only required a physical transformation, but to convince us he's an MMA fighter (don't worry, I was convinced within 1 minute!)A credit to director Gavin O'Connor, who said Tommy was the only actor who could play the troubled, younger Conlon sibling.

This isn't just a film about slugging it out UFC-style; this is a class in heavyweight acting. Tom's scenes with Nick Nolte as his ex-alcoholic father Paddy, are both funny and very moving. If Nolte doesn't get an Oscar nod (and post Oscar hindsight, he did but was robbed), then there's no justice in this world..the old man's still got it and sure he recalled his drunken past for this role of a lifetime. Joel Edgerton is another Aussie who's graduated from the ""Time to Fool Everyone with a Convincing American Accent, School of Acting"" - as Tom's elder brother, Brendan Conlon. It takes a long time before they meet (think of DeNiro and Pacino in Heat) and when they do, it's intense and explosive stuff. One of the twists is that they fight each other in the ring; how they get there will become apparent as you watch.

In what is billed as a man's film, Jennifer Morrison from House is the calming influence as Brendan's missus. She's not just a pretty blonde, she has heart and she's sassy too. I could believe more in her as Tess; than Amy Adams's Oirish barmaid in The Fighter, who, let's face it, was quite the skank! Warrior's' greatest strength is that it takes its time and doesn't overwhelm you and doesn't try to prove anything either. It's great film making and Gavin O'Connor deserves a pint (or three). In much the same way Rocky(1976) was shot on a very low budget, this has that same Everyman approach. In fact,
Warrior owes a debt to Rocky in its pre-title credits and the split-screen training montages. The fights are a feast for any UFC fan and kick serious ass. In parts, it's classic Americana: Downbeat and has a lot of charm; on the other, it makes me want to visit Pittsburgh now and to stick Ode to Joy on my iPod!

Special nods to the actors who played the students; the always great Kevin Dunn as Principal Zito (you couldn't make it up) and Bryan ""The Hangover"" Callen as a very funny UFC commentator. And Kurt Angle as a Russian head case!

If I have any gripes about Warrior, is that I would've liked to have seen the regimen of training to become an Ultimate Fighting Champion. And more scenes of Jennifer Morrison in her underwear (maybe they'll happen to find some deleted scenes and stick them on the blu-ray).

The blu-ray is gorgeous - do yourself the biggest favour and order it from Amazon: I prefer the cover of a lone Tommy with his back to us; than an overpriced high street record store, who uses a different poster and hikes up the price as well. The film looks amazing and the special features are great (nice to see Hardy looking comfortable in an interview as opposed to being interrogated by a second-rate UK chat show host).

Since critics have compared Tom to Brando, in which case I'll leave you with his most memorable role as ex prize-fighter, Terry Malloy from On the Waterfront. Yes, I still get the chills re-watching it and yes, I'm sure Hardy drew some inspiration too. An all-time, classic movie moment.

4513311,5,B00505QA90,"I was incredibly non-plussed when I first heard about this movie, and had no intention to see it, ever.  Then my 17-year old son had to have an operation on his wrist, so he had to take a couple of days to recover.  One of the movies he wanted to see while he was down was this one, and as those of you with HS senior-aged sons may know, it's sometimes tough to get one-on-one time with them.  Anyway, my son, who had seen this movie before, wanted to share it with me, so I plopped myself down and expected your run-of-the-mill fight movie - yawn.  But this movie has a lot more to it than that.

This film touches on a wide range of current issues and challenges - the war in Afghanistan, the downturn in the economy, the mortgage crisis, family crises, the impact of social media on our lives, etc.  And this is what makes this film more than a trite ""underdog faces overwhelming opposition"" story line.

I won't give away any spoilers, but an aged Nick Nolte plays the role of a reformed alcoholic who missed the chance to have any sort of positive influence on his two sons.  One eventually joins the marines, and the other settles down and works as a HS physics teacher, though they both grew up boxing and then engaging in mixed martial arts, but that was in the past.

The kinds of challenges faced by the characters in this film are believable, the story-telling is strong, and the acting is good.

All in all, this is a strong movie, though not one you would want to choose for a date night, if you know what I mean.  This is a movie is testosterone-heavy, but still amazingly good.

I am debating between 4 and 5 stars because the underdog story line is pretty heavily used, but I would be happy to see it again sometime, because I believe there is more there that I didn't catch the first time through - a hallmark of a good story.

P.S. Probably my favorite character in the movie was the HS principal...if you watch you'll see why.  Cheers.

Oddly enough later in the brothers lives it's the father who is trying to repair time lost, and the brothers want nothing to do with each other or their father.  One brother is a science teacher, and the other a marine and war hero, though the world doesn't know it. This movie is so much more than fighting...and I couldn't imagine someone not being touched by this film.  Watch it, just watch it.",1330646400,,671,4.430894308943089

As mentioned in other reviews, there's little new ground broken here in terms of story telling. Some may find the similarities to other sports tales (the obvious one being Stallone's ""Rocky"") a bit jarring but, in my opinion at least, ""Warrior"" stands out from the crowd.

It tells the tale of two brothers in conflict over a family past. Tom Hardy plays the tortured ex marine, desperate to redeem his imaginary failure in the Iraq war whilst Joel Edgerton, hardy's brother, is a financially struggling science teacher clambering to provide for his family and stave off bankruptcy. Nick Nolte really stands out with a fantastic performance playing the reformed alcoholic father striving for forgiveness from his sons and, I think, nails the part with real emotion and power. Throughout the film his guilt over his past is laid bare by his character culminating in a heart breaking scene where he falls off the wagon giving a glimpse at his alcoholic history.

The brothers have very different motivations. Hardy's character is difficult to like but excellent none the less, spending a lot of the film brooding over his perceived conduct whilst serving as a marine and struggling/refusing to reconcile with not only his father but his brother as well. There is nobility there however, conveyed in his reason for entering the contest. After all, he intends to give the prize money to the widow of a fallen comrade making the viewer have conflicting feelings for him. By that I mean he is a generally unlikable character but has a noble purpose. Hardy plays the part excellently, giving a convincing portrayal as a lost soul intent on redemption and has a real air of menace both in and out of the ring.

His brother played by Edgerton, is a completely different kettle of fish. A school teacher, he impresses a sense of civility as a family man simply trying to provide for his clan. Throughout the film the viewer is convinced that, given the choice, he wouldn't delve into the violent world which he is part of. Edgerton brilliantly portrays the grim desperation of a man with little choice left.

The film itself is well paced with an excellently balanced mixture of heartfelt emotion and bone shattering fight sequences. The general atmosphere is similar to that of the aforementioned ""Rocky"" in terms of the fact it's set in a city hit by recession with a war torn world stage backdrop, not to mention the underdog main story.

And therein lay the only jarring aspect of the story for me. Hardy's character is portrayed throughout the entire film as a virtually unstoppable behemoth of the fighting world, making short work of every competitor he faces without exception. And I mean that as literally as possible as the average length of one of Hardy's fights is around thirty seconds. Edgerton's character however, is never portrayed as much more than average, his only strength being the motivation to provide for his family. As a result of this, the ending feels distinctly unbelievable with Hardy's much more ferocious and capable character being beaten by his significantly weaker and less capable brother. The film would have avoided this if Hardy's character maybe had a few more close calls in the tournament, possibly giving the idea he is at least beatable but instead, he wades through rival competitors with apparently no effort.

Regardless of this last point however, I still would rate this film very highly indeed and would recommend it to anyone who is fan of this genre. A great film throughout, slightly let down with an implausible ending.",1330387200,,3573,4.91542288557214
4513314,5,B00505QA90,"Great story, fun fight scenes. More along the lines of a ""Rocky"" than a ""Never Back Down"" kind of movie. Compelling characters and story, not machismo MMA.",1330300800,,155,4.777777777777778
4513315,2,B00505QA90,"This movie had many things that bugged me.  Someone recommended this because I like watching UFC but the MMA in this isn't particularly compelling.  The problem with the fights is the camera work.  I don't think any of the punches actually get completely shown.  They either show just the guy throwing punches or just the other guy taking flailed punches from an unseen attacker.  The fence is always in the way and it feels like they've intentionally kept most of the action only half frame.  UFC had the smart idea of putting camera men up on the fence...  The whole movie is shot in a shaky, hand-cam style, often from a slightly too low angle looking up at the characters.  (Or maybe it just seems like a low angle to me because I'm not really short.)

The MMA matches are inaccurate.  Or maybe the rules are different than what I'm used to.  It's my understanding that you have to intelligently defend yourself at all times.  At least a few rounds in this movie end with one guy pummeling another guy who just lays there and eats it until he gets saved by the bell.  Any ref would stop that after like 5 seconds.  Also, while it's called a choke hold, it doesn't cut off your air, it cuts off blood to the head.  Properly applied (and this one looked pretty deep), this will knock you out very quickly.  You certainly don't have 30 seconds to ""just hold on"" until the end of the round.  The submissions in this movie involve more dramatic straining and pulling than I've ever seen.  It's really a matter of leverage.  Only if you're doing the hold wrong would you have to pull super hard.

Going into a MMA match without a support team is the height of idiocy.  Luckily most of that guy's matches didn't last the whole first round or you'd see him sitting there like an idiot between rounds.  Where's he going to get water?  Ice?  Clean up any cuts?  Well I guess that character wasn't super intelligent anyway.

My final criticism is that in one of the early scenes the physics teacher has a student demonstrate breaking a piece of wood with a bat. He tells the class ""if you have enough acceleration you might have a chance of breaking the object at rest.""  This is absolute nonsense.  He's trying to teach F=MA; he should say ""if you have a strong enough force"".  And the baseball bat is a terrible example of a force anyway because it's not accelerating, it hits with a specific velocity.  Way to confuse the students!  I'm glad he got suspended from teaching, he's a horrible teacher.  On that note, can you really suspend a teacher for competing in a MMA match on his own time?  That seems unlikely.  Don't teachers have unions?  I guess it's about as unlikely as a physics teacher in MMA in the first place.

If you can get past these specific criticisms the rest is sort of a low budget, less compelling Rocky.",1330300800,2,2823,4.466666666666667

This was a fantastic movie, great acting, awesome fight scenes, good family drama between father and sons.  Nick Nolte plays their recovering alcoholic father that didn't give them the greatest childhood.  I heard Nick is supposed to be up for some award for that role too.

Tom Hardy is a BEAST in this movie, it also makes you excited for The Dark Knight Rises, because he'll be playing Bane, and probably will destroy Batman in that one, lol.

And of course, the ending...how did the ending tie everything up and make you feel?  It was perfect I thought, because Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton both fight in the MMA championship, and end up having to face each other at the end, so you're kinda routing for both of them, and thinking..""How can this possibly end good??""

Here is courage, mankind's finest possession, here is the noblest prize that a young man can endeavour to win."" - Spartan poem.

Wow.

Powerful, powerful, powerful film.

Tells the story of three members of a completely dysfunctional family. A reformed drunk and his two sons; both of whom detest their old man.

The younger brother is Tommy, brilliantly played by Tom Hardy, a former all-state wrestling champion who fled with his mother just as he was being prepped for the Olympic Games. His older brother is Brendan, played by Joel Edgerton in a breakout performance.

Brendan, like his younger brother, had dreams of becoming a champion but couldn't get his father to take more than a passing interest in him, even when his 'favorite' son disappeared with his mother - there was nothing left for him. With his brother and his mother gone, the old man just sank into a dark abyss filled with booze.

Gratefully, the film doesn't get drawn into a pedestrian tale about physical abuse and alcoholism, but frames it without distortion so one can understand the pure anger the two feel toward their father. And because of one fateful decision that split the brothers apart, deep anger and boiling resentment against each other as well.

Tommy was left in a vacuum where he learned to hate. Brendan stayed, went to college and found a new life as a school teacher.

Fate intervenes and brings all three back together, but not in a happy kumbayah sugar circle. No, they collide at a fictional MMA tournament called 'Sparta', named after the ancient city-state which produced, what is considered by many, some of the finest warriors to have ever walked the planet, past or present. The reward for winning: $5 million dollars. For those that fall to the wayside - nothing.

Each brother driven by completely differing purposes; each one determined to win at all cost. It's a stunningly savage and brutal confluence - a true civil war fought on multiple fronts.

The acting was superb. The characters fully and completely developed. No weakness in either the script, cinematography, pacing, or directorship. A genuinely amazing, incredible and awe-inspriring film.

Man, this was one bleeping powerful bleeping movie. I thought '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Redbelt/dp/B001C5LLMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Redbelt</a>' was fantastic.

Just watch it.

Watch it for the characters, watch it for the drama, watch it because deep down we all want to feel this connected to the core essence of what it means to be a man - to fight with your heart and forgive with the same.

Personal Note: I've made mention before about the 'lost'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nick-Nolte/dp/B00009WVT3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nick Nolte</a>.

4513331,5,B00505QA90,"First off I have to say that I was not a fan of MMA before seeing this film. What drew me to it was the belief that it was more than just a sports film, that at the heart of the film was the relationship between the two brothers Tommy(Tom Hardy) and Brendan(Joel Edgerton). That belief was completely correct, this film manages to tell a wonderfully sad and ultimately redemptive story while at the same time being very respectful to the sport of MMA fighting.

The story of course centers around the two brothers, who are very much estranged from each other and their father, Paddy(Nick Nolte).  All three characters have issues but the most damaged is war vet, Tommy, who is played beautifully by Tom Hardy. Nick Nolte is also amazing in this as a former alcoholic who is now several years sober and trying to repair his relationship with his two sons. Although I gave lots of praise to Hardy and Nolte, I in no way mean to leave out Edgerton's performance, as I had really little interest in his character, a former UFC fighter turned high school Physics teacher trying and failing to make ends meet for his family, to begin with but I thoroughly enjoyed watching his part of the story unfold as well. I won't go in depth into the story but the basic plot is that both brothers make their way into SPARTA, an MMA fighting event put on to pit the best MMA fighters against each other until only one is left standing to claim the 5 million dollar prize, with the first part of the film focusing on setting up their personal lives and relationships with each other and their training for the SPARTA competition. The second part of the film features the brothers fights with other competitors, which are very cool btw, and leads into the conclusion of the film which I won't give away.

In all honesty I was expecting this film to be good but it completely blew me away with how great it turned out to be. It has incredible heart and lots of action and fighting, so for me it was the total package. It is about family first and fighting second but the fighting is handled extremely well and is essential to the story and plot. If you like bonus features as I do this blu ray has a lot of extras to offer including a deleted scene, gag reel, and a couple different short documentary's on the research  that director Gavin O' Connor and the rest of the crew put into the film in order to make the fighting realistic and credible.

So, in short the story was great, the characters are complex and easy to connect with, and the fighting is exciting and realistic. I loved this movie and I can't recommend it enough to people, even people like myself who are not into ""sports"" movies,and by sports movies I mean a film that focuses mostly on the sport and the game being played not so much the character development or a bigger, overall plot. And there is nothing wrong with those films, what I am saying is that I believe this can be enjoyed by an even bigger audience. The MMA element while essential to the film should not scare anyone away from watching this great film. This gets a very well deserved 5 stars from me because it was awesome and I can't wait to watch this film over and over again. It's simply that great.",1327968000,,3219,4.412457912457913

I thought it would be a rip-off of The Fighter. I thought it would be terrible and low-budget.  How wrong I was . . . I only watched this movie after reading a quick blurb in Entertainment Weekly where the author opined this movie should get a best picture nomination.  He was dead-on.  This movie was what The Fighter should have been.  It has a few weaknesses (a bit predictable in places, some amazing coincidences) but in the end it just doesn't matter because this movie does what few others do anymore: it tells a great story that really stays with you.  I am sick of movies where all the money is spent on special effects and the script gets whatever is leftover.  This movie is about two brothers torn apart by their dysfunctional family when they are young.  Sound bleak?  It really isn't because overall this is a movie about the human spirit. The story is told against the backdrop of MMA fighting, but the story is the real draw, the MMA is just the vehicle for it.

Mark my words: Tom Hardy will become the greatest actor of his generation.  (a secret - he already is).  He is the next big bad in the upcoming Batman movie.  Check him out in a little British mini-series called ""The Take.""  The man is a true chameleon if there ever was one. Nick Nolte also delivers a performance unmatched in his career.

4513342,4,B00505QA90,"I really hate the name of this movie.  In all honesty, the name `Warrior' denotes a cheapness that really isn't present here.  In fact, outside of some clichd plotting (especially in that final showdown) and some unflattering editing decisions (the workout montage was ill conceived, for my personal taste at least), this film is far from cheap.  `Warrior' is actually a very astute look at the war within ourselves to forgive and forget and move on from the roughness that is life.  While one may assume that `Warrior' is yet another attempt to cash in on men inflicting violence on other men for sport, it has far more heart than that.

I'd even go as far as to say that `Warrior' is superior to last year's Oscar horse, `The Fighter'; although they are both in the B-Grade level for me (`Warrior' inching more towards a B+).

`Warrior' tells the story of three men connected more so by violence than by blood.  Paddy Conlon is a former boxer and a former drunk who inflicted so much physical and emotional damage on his two sons, Brendan and Tommy, that he has absolutely no relationship with them.  Brendan ran off when he was still a young boy with his heavily abused mother and has been missing from Paddy's life for fourteen years.  Brendan stayed around, mostly because he had fallen in love with his High School sweetheart, and lives close by but remains out of touch with his father; sending the occasional picture and receiving the occasional phone call.  Tommy suddenly shows up on his father's doorstep.  He is shrouded with mystery and seems content with keeping his father at an extreme distance.  He is in need of some money and so he decides to train for a Mixed Martial Arts tournament, and he needs his father's help to do so.  Unknowingly, his very own brother Brendan is considering entering the same tournament.  Brendan, a former UFC fighter, is struggling to pay his mortgage and decides to pick up some extra money fighting.

Ultimately, we all know who is going to make it to the finals of that tournament.

Aside from the obvious predictability of it all (I did, honestly, have NO IDEA who was going to win that fight though), `Warrior' presents a message I wasn't ready to embrace, and yet it was so clear and so honest and so provoking that I can't help but embrace it now.  As the film prods along we get to see these men for the rugged, ravaged, barren souls that they are.  They seem hollow and hopeless and alone and desperate yet apathetic.  They have given up on themselves and all hope of reconnecting.  And then something happens.  Tommy finally abuses his father to a point of no return.  Tommy finally `becomes' the man he hated and then his father, broken to the bone, reverts and falls to pieces and Tommy, previously full of loathing, folds with compassion for the man he grew up fearing.  This same approach is taken at the end of the final fight, where the victorious brother embraces the losing brother with such tenderness.  It's funny, because as I was seeing it I was blown away by how much sense it really made.  In life, we can feel such distain, hatred or even malice towards someone, but when we see them fall apart, especially at our own doing, it rouses in us a love that is often misread as pity but is truly genuine in texture.  I've always said that you cannot hate someone without first loving them, and visa versa.  Those qualities are so specifically interwoven because they are the ying and yang of affections.  You cannot hate someone unless you know them intimately enough to care about who and what they are, and you cannot possibly love someone unless you are know them intimately enough to be moved to hate by their actions.  If you didn't love them then you wouldn't care if they hurt you.  `Warrior' displays that truth beautifully, with subtle notes that make a very big impact.

And the acting on all fronts is tremendous.  Many have noted Marlon Brando and his `One the Waterfront' performance when referencing Tom Hardy's performance here.  I wouldn't go that far, but he really evokes a sense of understanding with his rough yet pleading appearance.  For me, Joel Edgarton is the real standout.  He makes Brendan feel so human and relatable.  The way he aches to do right by his family is etched across his face perfectly.  I will say this; I'm surprised that Nick Nolte is not the frontrunner for the Supporting Oscar this year.  Sure, I agree that Christopher Plummer gave the better performance, and so when he wins I'll be ecstatic, but Nolte's performance here is not only great, it is so OSCARY.  I mean, he plays a reformed drunk, he has emotional breakdowns, he is supremely sympathetic despite his obvious monstrous past and he nails his two Oscar moments (the pleading with Brendan and that shocking hotel room scene with Tommy).  If anyone is going to take Plummer's Oscar from him, it'll be Nolte.

Either way, a VERY deserving performance is going to win on Oscar night.

So, in closing, I was very impressed with `Warrior'.  It's a little too long, it does have that unfortunate montage in the middle that feels dated, unnecessary and cheap, and the way the actual tournament is handled feels rushed in parts and drawn out in others (trying to create tension when we already know who is going to make it to the final two is a little pointless, but thanks for trying I guess), but `Warrior' says a lot more than it's stupid name suggests.

`Warrior' has real heart.",1327104000,3,5451,4.633333333333334

""Warrior"" -- as the previous fighting films mentioned before -- is about more than just fighting; it's about two estranged brothers, both of whom have childhoods that they are simply trying to move on from. Big brother Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) has a wife and two daughters that he is trying his hardest to support on his meager high school physics teacher salary while little brother Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a Marine who has come home to his former alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) in hopes to win prize money for the wife and son of a fallen comrade.

4513359,5,B00505QA90,"What happens when you have two separate underdogs fight each other in a winner-take-all competition? You end up hoping neither one of them will lose. That's the situation in this thoroughly engrossing mixed martial arts film. Something I never thought I'd say after teen-filled drama Never Back Down released in 2008 that used unlicensed MMA bouts as a backdrop.
Brendan Conlon (played by Joel Edgerton) is a man who gave up fighting professionally for his wife Tess (played by Jennifer Morrison) with whom he now has two daughters. Tommy Riordan (played by Tom Hardy) left home with his mother to escape his father's abuse and joined the Marines after she passed. Brendan (Edgerton) is now staring at a debt he can't overcome thanks to his mortgage and goes back to professional fighting in the form of parking lot bouts with inexperienced opponents. And when a video of one of these bouts on the internet is seen by his boss (Kevin Dunn), the principal of the high school where he teaches science, the winner-take-all event is his only hope to avoid foreclosure and relocation. Tommy (Hardy), on the other hand, made a promise to the family of a fallen comrade and intends to keep it no matter what that might mean for his competitors. That includes Brendan who is only revealed to be Tommy's brother well into the film.
I'm not really a fan of MMA. I had a passing interest in boxing at one time, watching it that is, but it passed. That said, a well-made film can make any sport, with the exception of curling, seem interesting. And while some may see the release of this film as being too soon after the critically-acclaimed 2010 Mark Wahlberg film The Fighter, or as some sort of Rocky rip-off, I see a well-made, well-acted, realistic film about two men determined to fulfill their obligations the best way they know how. In the ring. Not to mention the sympathetic performances put forth by Nick Nolte as the father of the two competitors and Jennifer Morrison as the suffering wife.",1326499200,,1991,4.740634005763689

4513361,3,B00505QA90,"I'm a pretty avid follower of MMA, it's kinda hard to keep up with ALL the promotions but I've seen almost every UFC produced and seen very many of the Pride events.  I recognized all the actual players in MMA off-screen and know the history behind the story of Koba, I think they did a really neat thing of trying to replicate that story for the casual observer but the fight sequences, while choreographed fairly well to simulate real violence in the cage, were still pretty odd and couldn't shake their hollywood choreography feeling.  I recognized Anthony ""Rumble"" Johnson (Midnight), Nate Marquardt, the others seemed like actors.

What I found to be really good were the performances by the supporting cast--Tommy Rierdon and Patty Conlon (Nick Nolte).  Nick Nolte actually did a really good job of portraying a recovering alcoholic trying to make penance for his transgressions against his sons in the past.  The story developed that plotline pretty well.  Tommy's character was easily the most intriguing AND polarizing, you really wanna like this guy but he's got some real demons but overall, you can't ignore the charisma his stage presence brings to the film.  The main character's performance was mostly humdrum for me...sometimes he seemed credible in his character and other times, it was very 80s-esque trying to recapture the magic of Rocky and the underdog overcoming the insurmountable odds before him.

That was my problem with the film, it carried 80s-like predictability and some of the fighting was just not very authentic, the 5-min rounds lasted maybe 60 seconds on-screen and it's painfully obvious, I think they should've been a little more faithful with trying to capture that element of MMA, it's not a big deal and prolly won't take anything away from the movie for most, but for the hardcore MMA fans out there, watch it with your tongue in cheek.

Patty Conlon, Tommy Rierdon, and the rest of the supporting cast really shined but the story line had its pitfalls reminiscent of 80s good overcomes evil films and the main actor borrowed too much credibility on credit.  To the point where you realize the credit will not be paid back!

Looking forward to seeing more productions with the actor who played Tommy Rierdon, I recommend this as a strong 'should watch' film, but falling just shy of a 'must watch' film.",1326326400,5,2345,4.9113924050632916

4513369,5,B00505QA90,"All three leads did an incredible job with their characters. Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, and Nick Nolte, great job on the performances.  Tom Hardy looks amazing as a bulked-up MMA fighter.  Nick Nolte looks and performs well as a ""beaten-down in life"" old man.  Joel Edgerton did a great job too.  Story was good, although it feels like it was missing something, but the way this movie was executed was incredible.  Great job on the cinematography. Just one or two scenes where the cameras were a little too shaky when they should've been steady.  The action and the flow of the movie were just right, the fighting was realistic.  There are a few scenes that are grainy, most-likely due to filming in incredibly low-light, but it was probably intended for the gritty feel of certain scenes. This film was entertaining, well-made from a filmmaking perspective, and I think I should have seen it in theaters. Excellent job to the director Gavin O' Connor for making a superb film.

As for the supplements, the best are the documentary about how the actors trained to become fighters.  It's about a half hour in length and worth watching. There's also a 20-minute interview with Frank Grillo (trainer for Brendan Conlon in the film) and trainer Greg Jackson that is interesting.  Only a single deleted scene not important to the film. A welcome addition to my Blu-ray collection. As for the Rocky comparison, I think Rocky still has the edge on storytelling and film, but this film comes close.",1326067200,,1489,4.803921568627451

This movie is a very typical of the genre and does not cover any new ground. The strained relationships between the brothers, the wife and husband, and the sons and their father are all very cliche and predictable. You'll also be able to predict the ending of the movie after about an hour or so (or alternatively, you could just look at the disc cover art). The acting is pretty solid, but unfortunately the three main actors weren't able to overcome the fact that the plot was very weak.

The film's biggest strength is the UFC-style cage fighting scenes, which for the most part were authentically choreographed and pretty compelling. I'm a big MMA fan so I gave the film 2 stars just for the fighting scenes.

4513391,5,B00505QA90,"I picked this up having heard a few positive things said about it on the web, but I didn't expect much more than some overly cliche drama and cool fights. I was pleasantly surprised with what is now one of my favorite films I've ever seen. First of all, those looking for some cool fights won't be disappointed. As someone who's done MMA I can say that while they aren't perfect, they do a great job of giving the ""Spark Notes"" version of the intesity and brutality that happen in the octagon.

However, the fights aren't what make this movie one that sticks with you. That honor would owe itself to the near perfect acting by everyone involved. Hardy does an amazing job of being a jerk and relatable at the same time. After seeing Warrior I now have no doubt that he'll be absolutely terrifying as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises later this year. The guy is seriously jacked, and portrays an unreal amount of animalistic brutality while still conveying human pain and emotion. Edgerton plays a fantastic yang to Hardy's Ying as the more cerebral and technical fighter that's also a much-loved chemistry teacher. Rounding out the main trifecta is Nolte with a flooring performance as the recovering drunk as a father. During certain scenes I literally just looked away and pondered how the heck he was pulling this off.

Please, I beg of you, don't dismiss this as ""just another Rocky or The Fighter."" It isn't. I personally found Warrior more engaging and impacting than either of those also excellent pieces. The story may be convenient and unlikely in certain places, but there are so many layers of conflict and emotion swirling around at all times that somehow it all works.

I know a lot of people rate on a 1 or 5 star scale, with nothing ever in the middle, but believe that I didn't just give this film 5 stars to give the highest possible effect on the overall Amazon rating. I gave it 5 stars because I don't think that there's one thing about it I would change. I know that there isn't such a thing a perfect anything, but it's the closest I've seen a movie come in some time. Don't take my word for it.

For me, it was easy to relate to many of the characters in this story and the loyalties they were trying to convey about family, the many types of family and social bonds not just blood but those we develop over time through mutual trials and tribulations, and it also speaks of the struggles that we so often endure and the sacrifices and decisions we are forced to make for those we care about. Furthermore, the actors played their parts perfectly. I couldn't be any more satisfied with the direction of this film, the evolving plot, and each actors performance was phenomenal. This isn't just your average movie about a single fighter who's struggle to the top is the focus of the entire film but follows several people though their journey, each with their own style and personality, and each has their own rich story to tell which unfolds to you as the film progresses. It is full of ups and downs for every character and is testimonial to how not everyone can win all of the time and that sometimes we must just pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off, sometimes with the help of others and sometimes on our own. As I stated earlier, this really is the best movie I have seen in years. I must see!",1325548800,,1299,4.46218487394958
4513411,3,B00505QA90,"Despite MMA's rising prominence it has generally been treated as an ""underground"" sport in films. That changes with Warrior, a movie that takes the familiar inspirational sports story with family conflict and intertwines that with an MMA tournament that carries large significance for the main characters. The fight action is authentic - though obviously some moments and results were played up for dramatic purposes - and in doing so it presents the sport in a legitimate fashion and one that translates well to the big screen.

The story focuses on two brothers - one a Marine recently returned to the US (Tom Hardy) and the other a High School physics teacher (Joel Edgerton) - who for their own reasons return to MMA training and eventually find themselves entered in a high profile winner take all tournament pitting 16 of the best middleweights in the world. A family split years ago has left them at odds with each other as well as their father (Nick Nolte).

It's somewhat unfortunate that the culmination with the two brothers facing each other in the finals was used to market the film, as that takes away some of the suspense, but most would have assumed it would reach that point anyway. Still it's the emotional journey that will click with audiences rather than discovery of the end result and in that regard it is successful.

There will be a few elements that need some suspension of disbelief. The viability of a 16 man tournament over two nights in a world dominated by UFC, the contrivances in how these two relative unknowns make the tournament to begin with, and one of them remaining a crowd favorite despite a late revelation are just a couple of them. The fight announcers are also annoying in how they constantly disparage the two. We get it. They're underdogs.

Despite all those things Warrior is quite powerful in its depiction of the family's struggle to reconcile and the circumstances of each individual character. The performances are excellent - don't be surprised to see a few names like Nolte getting nominated this award season. The decision made by the brothers has sent them down completely different paths and that is well portrayed. Kurt Angle even makes an appearance as an imposing Russian presence (seemed to be a take on Fedor Emelianenko) and he pulls off the role quite well despite not having a single word of dialogue.

Though it leaves some story threads unresolved Warrior is a satisfying film that is deserving of the accolades it has received. While I didn't find it to be ""Best Picture"" worthy I would put it on the same level as last year's The Fighter. The strong performances outweigh the story and the MMA action is refreshing given that boxing-themed films have been the staple of the inspirational sports stories for so long.",1325462400,9,2784,4.828092243186583

Some characters reconcile, some don't- that's real life and that's how they ended this movie. The MMA action was surprisingly well-done, though flawed. Striking and submissions were reasonably good but some of the throws were cartoonish.

4513414,5,B00505QA90,"Just wanted to add my own recommendation for the sensational 2011 film 'Warrior'. This one has it all, tremendous action / fighting scenes, high energy and a profoundly poignant drama that will leave the viewer physically and emotionally drained. The production values, story-line and dialogue are top notch and the acting is strong and believable. Nick Nolte as the reformed alcoholic father and Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy as his emotionally tortured sons are unforgettable. In my estimation Nolte performance is worthy of a best supporting oscar nomination but even more amazing is the portrayal delivered by Tom Hardy. It gives me shivers just thinking about it.

4513418,5,B00505QA90,"This is my favorite movie of 2011 and my favorite sports movie of all-time! I saw the trailer to this movie around spring of 2011. My reaction was, 'This is probably gonna suck really bad when it comes out.' The more I watched the trailer, the more I couldn't help but find myself building up my anticipation to see it. I guess the reason why would be because I love movies and I love MMA! We all know most or all recent MMA movies suck and haven't really been taken too seriously due to the previous attempts like 'Never Back Down', 'Fighting'(Not sure if it's even considered an MMA movie, but might as well be.), 'Unrivaled', 'Undisputed' 2 & 3(Great action in these 2 flicks), 'Flashpoint', and 'Redbelt' which was pretty good and realistic but was more of a drama than an MMA or sports movie. Now 'Warrior' has all the elements to make it a great picture. It was one of those rare movies that had you expecting it to be really good even though something inside you said it might suck. Boy was I wrong and glad! Great story, great acting, great action, great music, and an awesome cast. Nick Nolte deserves an Oscar nomination for doing such an awesome job. I am officially a Tom Hardy fan now. Now the most important and favorite part of the movie for me was the conclusion before the credits. I haven't found myself seriously tearing up like that during or right after an action scene since 'T2' or 'Braveheart'. It was such a bittersweet ending when the song 'About Today' starts playing at the end when the brothers are fighting. I'm gonna stop here because I feel myself tearing up just thinking about that final scene in the movie as they're walking back to the locker room and the father is looking at them from a distance. WOW!!! It's almost impossible for me to believe that there will ever be a better MMA movie than 'Warrior'! Great job to director, Gavin O'Connor! Too bad I don't see the movie getting a Best Picture nomination due to the nature of the media and the public's reaction to MMA.",1325376000,,2009,4.476839237057221
4513419,5,B00505QA90,"Nick Nolte deserves to be nominated for, and possibly win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His heartbreaking performance as Paddy Conlon is not only one of the best performances of 2011, but a fighting comeback for the actor in every sense of the word. This is easily the most surprising resurgence of a once-great actor since Mickey Rourke appeared in The Wrestler and Nolte's performance is equally powerful.

Opening in theaters back in September, Warrior quickly disappeared after grossing only $13 million domestically. Mixed-martial-arts isn't exactly mainstream, the two lead actors aren't ""stars"" yet, and Warrior was marketed no differently from every other film of this sort. In the last few years, audiences have already seen The Wrestler and The Fighter rendering Warrior superfluous. Critics were good to it, but not good enough and the film has now been left to gather its following on Blu-Ray. I had heard the kind words about it, but watched it for no other reason than entertainment value. Imagine my surprise...Warrior is possibly one of the most underrated films of the year and certainly one of the best. It appears as nothing special, but it's an absolute knockout.

The film begins with an emotional confrontation that establishes the type of acting we'll see throughout. Paddy Conlon, coming up on his thousandth day of sobriety, comes home to find his adult son Tommy Rearden (Tom Hardy) sitting on his doorstep. Their relationship is obviously strained over Paddy's past abusive behavior and Tommy doesn't believe that he's changed. The next day Tommy is involved in a bout with a professional fighter and a video of it goes viral on the internet. There's an upcoming mixed martial arts tournament with a grand prize of $5 million dollars. Tommy begrudgingly asks Paddy to train him, saying ""that was one thing you were good at.""

Meanwhile, Tommy's older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher with a wife and two daughters. A former UFC fighter, Brendan is struggling financially and finds that he has three months to pay the bank before his house is foreclosed. His wife is opposed to him fighting for money, but after he's suspended from teaching he's left with no alternative.

Warrior brilliantly spends the first hour following both brothers separately, taking time to establish these characters. Hour one is straight drama, while hour two brings on the action without sacrificing what grabbed our interest in the first place. Director Gavin O'Connor, who co-wrote the screenplay, is a director to watch for his masterful ability to handle character drama against the backdrop of men pummeling each other. He's made a movie that will appeal to both thinking moviegoers and...other moviegoers. More impressive is that Warrior uses the conventional, clichd character arcs (strained father-son relationships, sibling rivalry, alcoholism) and story arcs (financial struggles, redemption) that make up this genre and spins them into a compelling, relatable drama that transcends these barriers to create a film that never feels too familiar. Warrior has all the makings of a good movie, but those involved elevate the material to greatness. Not bad considering it tackles themes and plot devices that we've seen endlessly since Rocky debuted in 1976.

I know little about MMA, except that it appears pretty intense and leaves little mystery as to why some of the fighting scenes are so brief. The first fight with Hardy is well-choreographed, quick, and exciting. It makes you want to see more and then it makes you wait. The scenes that come later are not only emotionally involving, but quite simply...badass. This is coming from someone ignorant of MMA and with no interest in watching UFC or anything of that nature. These scenes are exciting and triumphant, complimented by great editing and hindered only by the use of shaky-cam. It's not as overbearing as it has been in other films, but it's not necessary either. It doesn't bring anyone closer to the action or make you feel more involved as an audience member; it's just a headache-inducing distraction. This fad of using it for action sequences needs to die a quick death.

Warrior provides two thoughtful dramatic conflicts that make the eventual climax all the more riveting. In movies like Rocky, Raging Bull, The Wrestler, and The Fighter you know who to root for while Warrior leaves you torn. Hardy and Edgerton are totally separated and do not share the screen until over an hour in. This confrontational scene is a tad melodramatic, some of the dialogue is shaky, but it gets the point across. It's just too bad the brawn loses some of its brain in this scene. Questionable execution of this scene aside, the performances are fantastic all-around. Tom Hardy is an animal and his rage-filled, sensitive performance is a great precursor to what we can expect from his portrayal as Bane later this year. Hardy's previous roles show his physical commitment and he's become very large and imposing here. It's not just the muscle he's accumulated that makes this a great performances, but the way he's able to convey Tommy's deep, emotional wounds using his eyes. Tommy isn't much of a talker, but his eyes speak volumes. In the emotional scenes, you can see quiet suffering behind them and in the film's climax there's just pure, animalistic rage. It's award-worthy for sure and a reminder of what great things Hardy will do as an actor. Nolte is heartbreaking, emotive, and sincere, playing a familiar character but using his own troubled history to add another level of pathos. If the Academy doesn't honor Albert Brooks for his role in Drive, they should be ashamed for not awarding Nolte. Brooks played against type and created a memorable villain. Nolte has made a comeback, reestablishing himself as an actor of indispensable talent in a performance that brought tears to my eyes more than once.

Warrior deserves more accolades. It never goes for easy sentiment and tells a complicated story against a solid, entertaining backdrop. It hits challenging emotional notes, inspiring a whirlwind of emotions that range from crying to cheering. With a stunningly poignant climax and an ending that gives you just the right amount of closure; few films of 2011 succeed on this level. Warrior is great drama, great action, and great entertainment, one of the best, most powerful films of the year.

4513425,5,B00505QA90,"I was unprepared to see such a classic performance by two actors I have never seen before in an MMA related movie. There were so many story lines and plots in the movie, that it completely overshadows the MMA, that wives and girlfriends alike would enjoy seeing this movie as well.. Nick nolte is cast perfectly as the drunk father of the two brothers.. He becomes sober, and trains one of them who has gone AWOL from the war in Iraq.. The older brother is a physics teacher, but is then suspended from his job, as he fights to help maintain his home and family.

If you are a big MMa fan, you would enjoy it somewhat, although the MMA is tarnished somewhat by the Coda Aka Kurt Angle, who does some pro wrestling moves that are too unrealistic for the MMA... It also seemed to be a big promotion for TapOut, which is the biggest producer of MMA apparel in the world. The movie was dedicated to it's creator Charles Mask Lewis, who died in an Motocycle accident two years ago.

At the end of the movie, I said to myself, that this was a highly underrated movie and should have gotten more acclaim for the whole production.. Too bad it did not do well in the box office.. Now people should rent/buy it.. Definitely!",1325116800,,1214,4.367256637168142
4513426,5,B00505QA90,"Two underdogs grabbing for the brass ring, a $5,000,000 winner-take-all MIxed Martial Arts tournament, that's way beyond their reach. ""Tommy"" is a loser, a Marine deserter using his dead mother's maiden name. Tommy has enough anger for a battalion of PTSD veterans, and a special reserve of anger for his father, a boozer who apparently abused Tommy's mother until she ran away with Tommy in his teens. Tommy has a Pittsburg PA accent to match Sly Stallone's, and a nihilistic slouch to shame Jon Voight. But Tommy is a Raging Bull in the cage, a born batterer who taps out his first two opponents in the ""Sparta"" tournament without breaking a sweat. He looks like the underdog you'd want good odds on.

The other underdog is Brendan, a happily married family guy, a high school physics teacher whose students actually treat him civilly. He's well-spoken, decent, personable, but his home is about to be ripped away from him by a bank foreclosure. He loses his teaching job when he wins a MMA bout at a local strip club. Despite his wife's anxieties, he decides that training for MMA matches with reasonable purses is his best bet to save his home. The ""Rocky"" side of him will become apparent when he gets bashed and bloodied to hell and back fight after fight yet always comes up with a way to win. In spite of his calm teaching demeanor and general nice-guy manner, Brendan also has a seething pot of anger against his father, with whom he chose to stay when his mother jumped ship.

But the gimmick here is that Tommy and Brendan have the same unforgiven father and the same dead mother. Is that clear enough? They're brothers who were separated as teens, one with Mom and one with Pop. They're ""alienated"". In fact, they seemingly hate each other's guts. If it isn't obvious to you, dear cinemaphile, that the two brothers will advance through the tournament and duke it out in the final scenes, you'd better stick with the films in the ""family entertainment"" section. The suspense of this film is over which of the brothers will 'cave' to his emotions and throw the fight to the other ...

There's a lot of formula boxing film stuff in ""Warrior"" -- stuff that plays the same whether the combatants are MMArtists, mud wrestlers, gladiators, or barroom brawlers. The only thing that saves the film is the grittily convincing acting of Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as the Conlon brothers. Good ol' Nick Nolte does a decent impersonation of an emotionally shattered failure of a father who has been twelve-step sober now for 100O days. The acting is strong enough to carry the film despite its twin flaws of improbability and predictability. It gets five stars from me for the very simple reason that I enjoyed it. We needn't worry about whether I was in an unusually good mood.

Some reviewers have declared that the MMA fight scenes were poorly done. I wouldn't know. I've never seen an MMA bout, not even on TV, nothing more than a minute or two while channel surfing. I kinda thought it was comparable to ""wrestling"" on TV back in the 1950s, more theater than sport, but apparently I was mistaken. People are really doing grave bodily damage to each other for your and my entertainment. Me, I'd rather watch my ten-year-old niece's ballet recital, and I'd much rather listen to a Beethoven symphony. But Beethoven makes an audible appearance in this film; Brendan's  trainer uses Beethoven recordings to teach his fighters self-composure, and Brendan enters the cage to the tune of Beethoven's Ode to Joy. Meanwhile, Father Conlon soothes his nerves by listening to audio tapes of Moby Dick. It reminds me of Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood quoting William Butler Yeats in ""Million Dollar Baby""....

4513433,5,B00505QA90,"I haven't seen a lot of 2011 movies that have impacted me as much as ""Warrior"" has. The story is about two estranged brothers one in the military that went AWOL returning to his hometown and the other one a physics teacher trying to meet ends meet with a family whose house is about to be foreclosed. Both brothers are very different in both goals and emotions, Tommy (played by Tom Hardy) an aggressive man who is quiet to himself and only speaks when furious. Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton) is a family man trying his best to support his family and pay off his home before the bank takes it away. Both brothers, while different, have a common relationship with their father (played by Nick Nolte) who was a former military man and alcoholic and neither brother wants anything to do with him. The whole story is composed around MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), which is the only way both brothers can understand and find answers in.

While the movie has very well choreagraphed fighting and a good introduction to t
he sport of MMA, the fighting in the movie is only but a subsidiary to the films main central theme. The movie is primarily about family and unconditional love for your family. Tommy and Brendan have a complex relationship, Tommy's beef toward Brendan is solely based on him eloping with his wife and leaving the family behind and most importantly leaving the mother who died without her other son around. The departure of his older brother and father made Tommy the bitter man he is while it is hard to feel his pain, he shows his warm human side when he talks to a close friend on the phone later in the movie. Brendan is a more straightforward character who lays out his goal out on the floor: win the MMA tournament, get the money, live a happy life; in contrast to Tommy whose goal is unknown until about halfway through the movie. There are key scenes in the film where the viewers can get a full perspective of the relationships between the chracters, and these intimate moments whether it be Brendan and the dad, Tommy and the dad, or Brendan and Tommy, it's those scenes between the family that carries the film to making it the near classic it is.

When watching the film you realize that rarely do films nowadays really contain complicated family relationships such as these, sure Warrior has it's cliches, but it really is an uplifting story. From the great fights displayed on screen, to the climactic battle between brothers and the great all around performances especially Nick Nolte for his portrayal of the trying-immense father, this is easily one of the best movies of 2011 and now officially my favorite MMA movie =)",1324857600,,2649,4.634042553191489

The 'who-fights-who' and 'who-wins' aspect was predictable but I'm glad for this because it let the film address the issue each fight represented. The background music was well done, the fighting was choreographed well and this movie shows that blood and gore aren't required in an action film if the story and cinematography are right.

So, it's a nice, light (at least not as heavy as the other reviews would have you think by referring to the family issues) and entertaining movie. Enjoy.",1324857600,2,662,4.849557522123894

However, the fight scenes were just OK, hardly comparable with the real thing, and some finishing moves left me thinking ""really, he couldn't get out of that?"". Overall hastily done choreographing with little passion or suspense to grab onto. The story itself is what really left me feeling cold. It was a nasty setup... brother hating brother, both brothers hating and disrespecting their father. Even Jesus Christ gets attacked while the brothers argue endlessly.  An AWOL ""hero"". Left me totally unable to identify with the characters. And the worst is, nothing gets resolved at the end. All the issues that are brought up in the movie are left dangling in the insipid wind. The movie ends with the last fight and that is that, no questions answered (like did the dead soldier's widow get to share the winnings after all?), no balm to soothe our wounded, aching souls.

4513456,5,B00505QA90,"Warrior is the best sports movie I've ever seen and not just that but also the best film I've seen all year.

The funny part? I hate sports films and never heard of this film up until my friend dragged me into it. Two hours later, we were sitting through the credits in utter silence.

It has been years since a film has managed to pull tears out of me.

And you know what? This isn't some artsy film that touches a few people... everyone else is raving about it. Look at imdb.com top voted films of 2010-2011, Warrior is currently #5 on the list and over at amazon.com it has a full 5 stars.

Stats as of 12/26/11:

46 reviewers gave it 5 stars
3 reviewers gave it 4 stars
2 reviewers gave it 3 stars
0 reviewers gave it 2 stars
1 reviewer gave it 1 star (either a troll or judgmentally impaired)

I've never seen these kind of numbers for any film on the site but fully understand why.

A few things that make this film work so well is that it transcends the biggest Achilles heel of sports films... predictability.

We always know that this person/team will either win or lose.

Here we're in love with the two struggling brothers working their way up the MMA food chain so when the numbers thin, our tension skyrockets... who do we root for???

There isn't one main character here... this is the story of two brothers and their father. All of them are looking for redemption. Their stories are unfolded an inch at a time, balanced out with superb action that grabs you in a scissor lock and doesn't let go.

Tom Hardy was a rising star I've had my eye on ever since Layer Cake but now he has graduated to one of my favorite actors and cannot wait to see him put the cowl on for the Dark Knight Rises. His performance in Warrior is nothing short of perfect.

No one really saw this film in its limited release but it's out on all VODs now so go ahead and see why everyone is buzzing about it.

Tell your family and friends about this film because it would be a huge injustice to see it not get any Oscar nominations but these days it's more of a political/money game than a quality game.

By the way, Tom Hardy's character on this film is the biggest badass of all time.

What are you waiting for? Go watch it!

4513461,5,B00505QA90,"I won't get into the film's premise because it's been covered well enough here. What I'll say is that I went into this film not expecting much more than a ""Boxer"" ""Rocky"" feel good film. I rented it because it looked like a halfway decent way to spend a couple of hours with. I read some reviews to juice myself up for it. I'll admit that I'm kind of jaded to these sort of films and I sure as hell didn't expect to actually like, let alone love it but that's exactly what happened. Believe the hype. Rocky is my all time favorite movie not for its intelligence but for the fact that its main characters felt real, I could truly identify with them completely. And what I especially love about this film is that it used the human element and not CGI or 3D to make me feel this way.

Haven't seen a lot of movies at the theater this year. Frankly, haven't been any that I could get myself up to driving to, and plunking down 10 bucks to see. But this is one I would have paid to see. A shame that it didn't receive the publicity that it deserves. What it does deserve is recognition at Oscar time. Best actors, take your pick. Best supporting actor, definitely Nolte. I damn near, no I did, cry, because of Nolte's performance. With all of the comparisons to Rocky, I still can't say this movie eclipses it. But I will say that this film does for MMA what Rocky did for boxing--it humanizes a sport characterized by brutality. Bravo!",1324684800,13,1431,4.3

4513464,5,B00505QA90,"WARRIOR is one of the finest films of the year - and that is a statement coming from one who does not like violent films.  The film does deal with UFC fighting, a mania incomprehensible to most), but it is more an extraordinary story about the magnetism of family.  Writer Gavin O'Connor (with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman) also directs this intense film and his sensitivity in bringing out brilliant performances from everyone in his cast is simply amazing.  This is a monumental achievement worthy of Academy Award consideration.

Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) has returned from a tour with the USMC in Iraq where he ran away after saving his fellow marines in a near fatal situation, witnessed the death of his closest buddy Manny, and went AWOL from the stress: he returned to the US to make sure Manny's family was cared for.  An ex fighter, Tommy drinks and does drugs and finally returns to his father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) to gain new training as a fighter.  The Conlon family history is tragic - the mother took Tommy away from Pittsburgh hoping her older son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) would follow - escaping the spiraling alcoholism of the father.  Tommy moved with his mother who subsequently dies: Brendon stayed with his father and the family ties seem to have been forever broken.  When Tommy returns Paddy is 1000 days sober, but instead of love for this father Tommy loathes him and only wants his expertise as a trainer.  Paddy consents and the two begin training at Paddy's old friend Colt Boyd's (Maximiliano Hern&aacute;ndez) Gym.  In Philadelphia Brendan is a high school Physics teacher and has married Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and they have two little girls, one of whom has renal damage that has been so costly that both parents must each hold down two jobs to survive.  Brendan happens upon a Mixed Martial Arts fight (he spends his nights as a bouncer in a club making very little money) and decides that the money he can gain through fighting may save his home from going into foreclosure): he fights, and wins $200.  When he shows up at school to teach he is bruised and cut and is suspended without pay for disgracing the school (the principal - Kevin Dunn - hates to lose his finest teacher). With a dim financial outlook Tess hesitantly agrees for Brendan to re-enter fighting for money and Brendan hires his old friend Frank Campagna (Frank Grillo) to train him.

There is a much publicized tournament for the championship in Mixed Martial Arts in Atlantic city and through many strange coincidences the two brothers end up in the final fight -  fighting each other. The end is brilliant in its understatement, not stooping to resolve all family problems,  but at the same time having the courage to show how powerful is the love of two brothers no matter how different their lives.  Both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are brilliant as the brothers and Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career.  Every character created by this extraordinary cast is pitch perfect.  For this viewer this is one of the most moving films that has been released in a very long time.  Grady Harp, December 11",1324684800,,3127,4.7467652495378925

It breaks my heart that it was largely ignored in theaters and has been omitted from a lot of critics' year-end top 10 lists. I add about 5 movies to my DVD collection each year. 'Warrior' is one of those 5 for 2011.

Much to my surprise, this movie involving MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighters is an emotionally riveting character study that retains elements of action and suspense. And the acting is first-rate! Tom Hardy (from Inception) plays Tommy Riordan who deeply internalizes anger and guilt that we catch a glimpse of each time he's in the ring. Joel Edgerton plays high-school Physics teacher Brendan Conlon, Tommy's brother, whose financial struggles send him to a place he had not planned on returning to. And finally, Nick Nolte gives a devastating performance as Tommy's and Brendan's father desperately seeking redemption from both of his sons. To say more would ruin it.

Gavin O'Connor gave moviegoers a gift with this movie, and managed to fulfill his vision, while the acting carries a knockout punch.  With searing moments of inner pain, redemption and hope carry the day.

As for the DVD extras, they're worth the price of the DVD.  Behind-the-scenes footage of fight training camp, with comments by O'Connor and the actors is fascinating.  The one deleted scene is masterful ... Nolte got an ovation from the crew, and it was the first scene shot in the film.  I wish there were more deleted scenes, but this one is top-notch.

Best of all there's the much needed build to a great finish that is so much better than you will envision because you are inside the cage fighting [and bawling] for each fighter.

No blood, no real violence, and no sex keeps this movie close and intimate for every viewer whether they're into mixed martial arts or not. Hate to do the five star thing since this is my first review of a movie on Amazon but dang on it, the performances are so five star!

QUESTION FOR A CAR ENTHUSIAST:

4513479,5,B00505QA90,"""Warrior"" is great! This is how the story goes: An ex-Marine haunted by a tragic past, Tommy Riordan returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlists his father, a recovered alcoholic and his former coach, to train him for a mixed martial arts tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan, a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a public school teacher, returns to the amateur ring to provide for his family. Even though years have passed, recriminations and past betrayals keep Brendan bitterly estranged from both Tommy and his father. But when Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog sets him on a collision course with Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart, all the while waging the most intense, winner-takes-all battle of their lives.

The cast led by Tom Hardy (as Tommy), Joel Edgerton (as Brendan) & Nick Nolte (in a terrific Oscar-worthy performance as Paddy Conlon) is great. The directing by Gavin O'Connor (who also co-wrote the story & screenplay and makes an appearance as J.J. Riley) is great. The story by O'Connor & Cliff Dorfman & the screenplay by O'Connor, Dorfman & Anthony Tambakis (who also co-produced) is great.

The music by Mark Isham is great. The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi is great. The film editing by Sean Albertson, Matt Chesse, John Gilroy & Aaron Marshall is great. The casting by Randi Hiller is great. The production design by Dan Leigh is great. The art direction by James Donahue is great. The set decoration by Ron von Blomberg is great. The costume design by Abigail Murray is great.

This is a great and well-made movie that is entertaining and well-crafted. This is also a heartwrenching film that keeps your mind thinking while your heart is racing. Tom Hardy & Joel Edgerton are terrific. This is one of the best films of the year.",1324425600,,1937,4.8459214501510575

4513484,4,B00505QA90,"*SPOILER ALERT*
I really l iked this movie and thought it was good. It was interesting. had the physical and emotional aspect of life, along with family ties. Basically what I got was it's about a family who's father was a drunk and abusive. The mom and youngest son tommy left them, and brendan the oldest son stayed behind. The father gets sober a little less than 3 years and tommy comes back from the marines only to say mom died....and then he wants his dad to train him to fight. Both of the sons through the whole movie most obviously hate the dad and have major resentment.
So the plot is all about this tournament winner takes all 5 million $. Brendan a physics teacher learns that he is in need of money due to his hosue being in danger of foreclosure, implicitly seen because of shady bank advice. So the retired ufc family man with 2 daughters thrust himself back into the mma world for some quick cash to save his house. meanwhile tommy is training with paddy the dad. I am only explaining all this because the movie built of tommy so much the ending threw me for a major negative loop although i like the ending I am sure it could have went a different route. So tommy always got the attention from paddy, the father, and was #1 state champ in wrestling for high school. A marine who even saved other marines in times of danger, gone awol because couldn't cope with the tragedy is trying to make some bucks so he can help his fallen comrade/ best friends family. So during training he knocks out the current middleweight mma champ tko in a sparring session, which lands him a ticket into spart, the 5 mil tourny. His first round he knocks the guy out with 1 punch. The second round was the mad dog , same guy as in the sparring session, but because mad dog was talking trash, he got knocked out in like 5 seconds with a ground and pound (face smash). That's all I remember up until his final fight with his brother. So the movie built him up as the mega ultimate fighter who defeats all opponents in like 5 seconds. It's known his dad is a war vet and a talented trainer.
so tommy's brother brendan is now a physics teacher out the game, out of shape and married with children. Soft as it is. He asks an old friend to train him to make money to safe his house. I think he gets around 5 weeks. During the training he shows major improvement and even bests the the fighter chosen to go to sparta.his old friend, the manager, now replaces the #1 guy due to injury with brendan as a request or all by chance/ luck. So in all brendans matches he is the underdog and gets beat up, smashed, pounded, mashed, thrown around, and pulverized, but he manages in all 3 matches to tap them out. Even the russian undefeated champ. So here's why i wrote all that. The family man who by luck rises to the final round is up agianst his ultimate warrior marine brother. and again no contest but brendan slips a move and dislocates his bro's shoulder and goes on to win. Now I love the ending because he gets to keep his house and will probably help tommy's best friend's family out but come on. This is no david and goliath here. I mean i would have believed it mroe if brendan was a Godly man who won because of the power of God because other than that it seems like luck. The movie built tommy up so much there simply was no room in the script for him to loose and I was disappointed. All this said I am still happy with the movie and the ending and think it's better than the fighter! Not sure if it will ahve a sequel but it was so good it could have one! Merry Christmas! Godbless.

Although I have already seen some of the others on the big screen, the 1st DVD I pop in happened to be 'Warrior.' Mind you, I didn't have any expectations nor did I even have a clue what the movie was about. As it started, it seemed like it was going to be a somewhat slow drama, but as the film progressed, I was greatly mistaken. Nick Nolte's performance got me a little teary eyed before we were even into the meat of the story.

This film, the way it was directed, acted, written, and fought was truly exceptional. I have to say that this goes down in one of my all-time favorites list.

Even after watching some of the other competition like 'War Horse,' 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,' 'Coriolanus,' etc..., 'Warrior' is still my favorite of the bunch.

4513487,5,B00505QA90,"This story follows an emotionally scarred family trio.  Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher who returns to his former profession (MMA fighter) for extra money to keep his home afloat from foreclosure.  When this financially desperate decision results in his suspension without pay, he has no choice but to engage in mixed martial arts full time.  Meanwhile Brendan's brother Tommy (Tom Hardy) returns home from serving with the Marines, arriving at the doorstep of his father (Nick Nolte as Paddy Conlon) and eventually seeking him out as a trainer for a grand prix MMA tournament which will recognize the toughest middleweight fighter in the world...the tournament is called Sparta!

 This already has all the trappings of a good sports fighting movie.  However, we soon learn that Tommy has not a warm ounce in his heart for his alcoholic father, who trains Tommy desperately hoping to find some vestige of reciprocal love in his unflaggingly resentful son.  Paddy also yearns to reconnect with Brendan, who shuns his destroyed father despite the fact that one of his little girls has never met her grandfather.  As if this wasn't enough, the enmity Tommy feels for his older brother is yet more vicious than that reserved for his father.

 By composition this is an anti-fight-movie, but somehow it strikes me as the greatest fight movie since Rocky!  The standard formula of a boxing movie relies on several key elements, all such rules of which are broken in Warrior.  1) Extensive training scenes demonstrate the fighter's hardship and devotion--training scenes in this film are minimal and seem more informative about mixed martial arts than demonstrative of the hardship or devotion.  2) The fighter turns to his family for support to overcome the training and insecurity of the upcoming fight--the only family under the lens here is a sundered father and sons who all turn to the fights to escape their family's general paucity of love and forgiveness.  3) The fighter has a resistant loved one and his relationship is tested--Brendan's wife, while clearly not a fan of the idea, makes no concerted effort or threat to keep her husband out of the ring.  4) The actual fights are few in number and serve as highlight montages, building up to post-victory catharsis--these fights are extensive, numerous, and view reel-to-reel as if complete, with most catharsis delivered ""during"" the fights!  5) The fighter faces an unlikeable (or at least very arrogant in the case of Rocky's Apollo Creed) or even evil antagonist--the antagonist in this film is the Conlon brothers' unwillingness to forgive.  The single major element that the classics have in common with Warrior is that Brendan is the ultimate underdog and, like Rocky Balboa, fights from the heart.  You never think he should be able to defeat his opponents, but you believe it when he does it!

 While this movie is not so much about who wins the fight, it is still very much about victory.  Nick Nolte plays the damaged, AA-devout, alcoholic Paddy to perfection.  He drove his family apart and crumbles whenever he is reminded of the monster he once was and is horrified by the thought of becoming that monster again.  He serves as the bone on which his children sharpen their fangs.  Amid this loveless viciousness, this film manages to pull the audience from feeling irreparably beaten, to excited and motivated, and ultimately inspired--perhaps awestruck.  The fights were thrilling, shocking and technically stunning.  On the softer side, my throat tightened up more times than I care to admit and culminated in some tears in the same five minutes that I was screaming at the screen during the final fight as if I had money riding on it.  Between the exquisitely written characters, engaging fights and solid guy-cry, I can't remember feeling so affected...and it felt amazing.

This movie isn't for MMA fans, it's for everyone.

Don't miss this one.  Don't you dare!",1324252800,2,3966,5.010687022900763
4513488,4,B00505QA90,"I remember watching the trailers for this movie several months ago and not being terribly excited about another ""fighter"" movie.  Especially so close to ""The Fighter"" late last year.  Add in a couple foreign actors I didn't know much about and a washed up Nick Nolte and really, do I want to see this?  And then this really isn't boxing, this is mixed martial arts.  The art being where 2 guys try to beat each other to death using any means necessary outside using a weapon.  Hell, they even use a cage.  But then I remember ""The Wrestler"" from 2008 which was a very good movie, so what the hell.  I liked this movie from the opening bell as it were.  We see WARRIOR spelled out in screen-filling dimensions, followed by no credits.

The film has 2 characters on a literal collision course to a potential $5 million payday.  One is a former MMA fighter who was described by one analyst as being ""memorable for being unmemorable.""  He's currently a physics teacher at a suburban Philadelphia high school but is on the verge of losing his house to foreclosure.  The other character is his estranged younger brother Tommy played by ""Inception's"" Tom Hardy.  He has just returned from the Marines having served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He returns to Pittsburgh where his father (Nick Nolte) is a reformed alcoholic.  He obviously never received any father-of-the-year awards driving Tommy and his mother away to Oregon years earlier.

Tommy wants his father to train him for the tournament like he did when Tommy was a stellar high school wrestler.  As bitter as Tommy is about his dad, he's even more so about his brother who stayed behind. He was just 16 and was in love with the girl he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison).  We know how the tournament will evolve, having seen everything already in the many trailers.  Brendan (Joel Edgerton) will fight his brother in the finals.  Nobody knows they are brothers because Tommy adopted his mother's maiden name.  Now, ""Warrior"" breaks no new ground.  It has all the fighter clichs, going back to ""The Set-Up"" from 1949 to ""Killer's Kiss"" (1955) to 1976's Rocky to ""The Fighter.""  It's the underdog or in this case underdogs struggling to overcome their weaknesses.  It is a common theme.  That and many other clichs are not dodged by director Gavin O'Connor.  In fact they are embraced.

What makes this movie different and yes, better are the actual words coming out of the actor's mouths and the actors who deliver them.  Tom Hardy gives a performance that you can't forget.  And Nick Nolte?  Who knew he had it in him?  Put him on a short list for Oscar consideration.  I found myself getting involved and ultimately committed to this story and its characters.  The fight scenes are very realistic although I admit I couldn't figure out some of those submission holds.  Watch the movie for the emotional conflict, the personal drama and the fine acting.  The fight action is just a bonus.",1324252800,3,2948,4.7362204724409445
4513489,5,B00505QA90,"Warrior, hits you in the gut, pulls at your heart and keeps you riveted to your seat from opening to closing scene. I guess for me, being I have two brothers, in an Irish household, we had our fights and love ea other dearly, but we sure had our differences and struggles, especially with themes in this movie, like alcohol abuse, anger, etc... this movie made me cry rediculous but also grabbed at me being a father of two girls myself and also reignited my desire to get back into shape and start excersising again. While I'm not a fan of UFC fights, I think it's too much about the violence or brutality more so than the actual techniques to the mixed martial arts. I AM however, intrigued by MMA techniques, especially in my new workout regimens. They're great for burning cals and shedding weight, and just jazzing yourself up to feel better. It works for me, and Warrior was AMAZING film. Probably one of the best if not THE BEST of 2011 in my opinion.

Tom Hardy Rocks in this but Gavin O Connor clearly brought us a film, much like Rocky did in the 70's and 80's, to uplift the warrior in all of us.",1324252800,,1107,4.3478260869565215
4513490,4,B00505QA90,"""You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home."" After being away from home for a long long time Tommy (Hardy) comes back to see his father Paddy (Nolte). Across town his brother Brendan (Edgerton) is having financial troubles. The only way the two brothers can find a way to make the money they need is by fighting in an MMA tournament. Tommy asks his father to train him and the family dysfunction grows until the tournament. Regardless of what I say here this is a great movie. My problem with this is that I think my expectations were too high. Any movie that draws comparisons to ""Rocky"" gets my hopes up (like ""The Fighter""). Much like ""Rocky"" though, this movie has the fighting as a secondary plot to the family struggles that are going on. This movie is very interesting in the way that you are not sure who is the ""good"" brother and are not really sure who to root for the entire time. If you have seen ""The Fighter"" you may agree with me when I say that the movie was good but Christian Bale's performance made the movie. Nick Nolte gives that kind of performance in this one. He takes a part that could get glossed over and makes it stand out enough that to me he is the front runner for an Oscar. Overall, a very good movie but my expectations were too high to love it as much as I wanted. Of the last ""fighting"" movies to come out I would have to say this is 3rd on my list. After ""The Wrestler"" and ""The Fighter"". Still very much worth watching though. I give it a B+.

Like others have stated, this movie isn't just about MMA or fighting, it's more then that.  It's about two brothers that drifted apart from their alcoholic father that by fate end up sort of reunited together.  However, don't expect a cinderella happy ending.

4513496,5,B00505QA90,"In a summer overcrowded by superheroes movies, WARRIOR went largely overlooked.  Instead of high octane explosions and big-budget special effects, this was a movie with well fascinating real-world characters, drama, and some amazing fights.

Lonely old Paddy Conlon, (played by hoarse-voiced Nick Nolte of 48 HOURS and CAPE FEAR fame) is a retired mill worker and reformed drunk whose abused wife and angry children have not spoken to him for years.  He finds himself drawn back into family life when his son, Tommy (Played by Tom Hardy--who should become a household name for playing Bane in the upcoming Batman movie), now in the Marine Corps, shows up on his doorstep with a bottle of booze.  Tommy has a chip on his shoulder that could fill the Grand Canyon.  By all appearances, his only reason for visiting his father is to express his hate exercise the hateful demons that vex his every thought.

While visiting dear old dad, Tommy becomes a member of the local mixed martial arts gym.  As it turns out, he is a natural-born killer in the ring.

Meanwhile, Paddy Conlon's other estranged son, a soft-spoken high school teacher named Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton--Anakin's step-brother in REVENGE OF THE SITH), re-enters mixed martial arts in the hope of stopping the bank from foreclosing on his home.

Paddy has dreams of bringing his family back together, but his sons hate him and his wife is dead.  Instead of bringing his adult sons under his wing, he finds himself rebuffed by both of his boys as they  prepare to enter a high-stakes mixed martial arts tournament called ""Spartan.""

The twists and turns in this movie are sometimes predictable, but not unwelcomed.  The acting is generally amazing.  Hardy (who is British) and Edgerton (an Australian) are convincing as  martial artists and also as Philadelphians.  Nolte, an old pro, is sympathetic throughout.

The fighting scenes are well done but it is the Cinderella story that really pulls you in.",1322092800,,1970,4.9573170731707314
4513497,5,B00505QA90,"My thoughts after watching this movie first singles out Nick Nolte. There are successful and bankable actors whose careers began as good looking leading men with roles that showcased their looks. Few have evolved as actors that portrayed characters and roles that were both complex, subtle and somewhat contrary to their previous persona. I recognized this of Nick Nolte with his role in Clean, portraying a character and role that was complex with a understated presence while holding the story together.

Many may want to compare this movie to Rocky or numerous similar type movies that play on our emotions of the main character, obvious underdog, unknown and rising against adversity, succeeds and defeats the obvious bad guy at the end. Fairly simplistic supported by a few obvious subplots cranking up the adversity or evil character of the central bad guy figure. Warrior was able to transcend the Rocky like level by offering complex subplots that seemed initially disconnected until they weaved together as the movie progressed.

The two main characters portrayed as fighters made me think ' where did they find professional fighters with noteworthy acting ability'.  Many action/fighter lead actors may come from pro wrestling, portrayed as being a real sport, not unlike reality tv, being scripted, over the top and genuine to those that can suspend their grasp of believability while viewing. Both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton who portrayal of the two fighters can only be called exceptional by bringing  believability and complexity to their characters.

The writing, direction, art direction and production were exceptional by weaving together a movie that was both cerebral and emotional and most important, highly entertaining.",1321660800,,1742,5.32
4513498,5,B00505QA90,"I'd rank this film up there with 1976's ""Rocky"":  It's tough, violent, and brutal, but it has underlying gentleness and heart.

I probably wouldn't have gone to see this film had I not already seen Tom Hardy in ""Bronson"" (my one-word review of his performance in that: ""WOW!"").  Hardy is impressive both as an actor and as someone who can physically transform himself.  He added some 40 pounds of muscle for this role, looking quite fearsome and imposing.  Hard to believe this is the same guy who played ""Twombly"" in ""Black Hawk Down"" -- there is almost no resemblance.

Hardy and actor Joel Edgerton play estranged brothers who, via different paths and with different motivations, enter a winner-take-all mixed martial arts tournament.  Both brothers were trained in their youth by their father Paddy (Nick Nolte, excellent as always) and both resent him because of his abusive, alcoholic nature.

The martial arts fighting gives the film its energy and action, but the family dynamic gives the film its heart.  The film never stoops to weepy melodrama, as many other sports movies with similar concepts have.  The characters -- even the supporting ones -- are sufficiently fleshed out and believable:  they are the connective tissue keeping the entire body in good shape.

There are one or two moments in the cage that stretch believability just a tad, but they are essential to moving the story to its inevitable showdown.  Knowing what's at stake for the two finalists, I think we can forgive the filmmakers for that.

Director Gavin O'Connor proved with his 2004 movie ""Miracle"" (about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team battling the Soviets) that he knows how to make a great sports movie that puts the characters at center stage.  O'Connor has done it again with ""Warrior"".

Highly recommended.  It's as great a sports movie as ""Miracle"", ""Rocky"", ""Hoosiers"", and ""Rudy"", movies that all were more about personal triumph than sports victory.",1321401600,,1948,5.0

4513502,3,B00505QA90,"I went to see Warrior on my birthday last week because 1) I heard this was basically ""The Fighter with kicking"" and I enjoyed The Fighter a lot and 2) I wanted to see how Tom Hardy would pull off a physically imposing role with him playing Bane in next year's The Dark Knight Rises (as if you didn't know already). This film was also receiving good reviews and I'm always looking for a good story.

The good news is that I think Tom Hardy will have no trouble convincing anyone he can go toe to toe with Batman next year, as his character in this movie was just destroying guys convincingly.

Perhaps the not so good news is that, after having several days to digest the movie, I'm not sure it was all that good. There are similarities between Warrior and The Fighter, with the sports aspect and focus on the family dynamic, specifically between two brothers. Most of the time it's fairly easy to make and enjoy a sports movie because they tend to include an underdog and a relatively one dimensional demonized antagonist. What makes Warrior a bit different is that it's a story that belongs to both of the brothers, and they both have very good reasons for entering a $5 million mixed martial arts tournament. Some of those who came to see the movie with me even turned to me during the film and remarked how they weren't sure which one they should root for.

I can see how this kind of ambiguity can be appealing and even enough to convince folks that this is perhaps twice as good as the standard sports movies because you can root for either one of these brothers, but the more I think about it, the more it feels like they wanted to make a movie about one brother and one about the other and in the end each was given half a story and half a movie. This was particularly true of Tom Hardy's character, Tommy, who plays a very rough around the edges ex soldier with a dark past. We're introduced to Tommy first as he confronts his father, Paddy (played by Nick Nolte), after a decade-and-a-half estrangement that began when Tommy and his mother fled from his abusive father. Tommy's older brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), stayed with Paddy to pursue his high school sweetheart. To Tommy's surprise, Paddy has been sober for years now, as Tommy has obviously taken to drinking to drown out his ghosts, including the memory of his mother, who became ill and died after they fled. Tommy uses virtually every opportunity to throw his father's past nature in his face; it's clear Tommy despises his father, yet returns several days later to ask his father to train him for an upcoming MMA tournament due to Paddy's great success as Tommy's childhood wrestling trainer.

With all of this potential for drama, it may be puzzling to note the assessment of Tommy only having half a story. However, the reason I think the movie fell short of exploring the dramatic potential was because Tommy is constantly acting like a douche bag, and all of his redemptive qualities seem to be buried in his past along with his demons. There are adequate opportunities to explore the strenuous bonds between his father and him and between him and Brenden, but the movie has Tommy slamming the door on these chances time and time again. Of course, there is understandable resentment and anger Tommy bears towards both of them, so it makes sense that he doesn't break down and try to begin anew with either them right away. But, this isn't the problem; the problem is that there is a distinct lack of exploration of these issues brought on by the writers keeping him in the same gear throughout the movie. It felt as if there needed to be another character in this movie that Tommy could express himself to so we could get a better look inside his head, because when the redemptive moments do come, they seem almost forced, and when the reconciliation moments come, they certainly seem too quick.

Brenden, on the other hand, has his motivations laid out for us. It's revealed he used to fight in MMA matches but has since given that life up at the behest of Tess, his then-sweetheart and now-wife. Brenden is now a high school physics teacher and raises two kids with Tess, and their family maintains a wide emotional and physical distance from Paddy. Tess and Brenden have three jobs between them, but still struggle to make ends meet. A major blow comes to the family when Brenden is informed that he doesn't have the money needed to keep their house, which will be repossessed in a matter of weeks. Desperate, Brenden enters a minor cash prize MMA fight and wins, but the telltale signs of fighting put a strain on his marriage and cause him to get suspended without pay at the high school. Low on options, he convinces his wife to let him start fighting again in order to keep the house, and he enlists the help of his friend and old trainer, who also happens to be training another participant for the major MMA tournament in which Tommy will participate. During the obligatory montage of training and minor fights, this other fighter is injured and Brenden convinces his friend to let him take the fighter's place in the tournament.

The stage is set and the brothers collide as revealed by the trailers and the cage is where the brothers have most of their interaction. Throughout the tournament, Tommy proceeds to dominate and Brenden maintains an underdog  status. Brenden's motivations are clear throughout, but Tommy remains a mystery to the film's audience and fans of the tournament until bits and pieces of his past come out. The revelations of Tommy's doing what he does and being who he is are painted in about the most undeniably selfless way possible, which is in stark contrast to the belligerent jerk he is to everyone, so it's hard not to feel the filmmakers poking you with a stick and demanding you like him.

I have no doubts, though, that some will look at what Tommy's done and been through and find him easily justified and likeable, but this wasn't my only gripe with the film, despite being the major one. It was unavoidable to compare this movie to The Fighter, and this comparison doesn't help Warrior very much. First off, the acting was far superior in The Fighter, from Christian Bale's chameleon-like portrayal to Amy Adam's edge providing a pleasant departure from her wholesome roles. You can say that Tom Hardy effectively pulls off his character's angry and aloof nature, but the character provides so little room for Tommy and Paddy's words and emotions to carry a dynamic with, leaving no real stellar performances. Secondly, there was a distinct lack of pure entertainment moments that are associated with sports films, the ones where the underdog or the trainer pulls off a pitch-perfect one-liner or completes a move that's smart, sneaky, yet still within the boundaries of the rules; this was particularly evident in the dialogue, which wound up largely forgettable.

Despite the filmmakers wanting to achieve (by any means necessary) a double helping of heroes to root for, I felt that both characters of Tommy and Brenden were shafted in some aspect, with the writers keeping Tommy in neutral through too much of the film and the director demanding very little from Edgerton's Brenden. Still, Brenden comes out more likeable and relatable. The movie was good enough, but I felt it could have been better had the dialogue distilled the character's emotions and motivations more clearly and punctuated the scenes. It should get some credit from deviating from standard sports movie fare, but not to the point where we overlook its flaws and overrate it.

I'd give it a 3-3.5/5 stars, largely because I am a sucker for sports movies.",1316390400,8,7657,4.694713328369322

Tommy (Hardy) and Brendan (Edgerton) are estranged brothers who both enter the same MMA Tournament. Tommy is an ex-Marine, an Iraq War hero, fighting for a fallen brother and Brendan is a married Physics Teacher fighting to keep a roof over his family's head. They have an ex-alcoholic, ex-abusive father that they both dislike who caused heartache and a terrible childhood for both of them. Their father, played by Nick Nolte (incredible performance)tries like hell to make it up to both of them and becomes Tommy's trainer. Their past mistakes and regrets all come to a head in the arena.

4513504,5,B00505QA90,"Except for the lack of a SPOILER note at the beginning of the first reviewer, I think these first two reviews pretty much cover the story and hit some high points of the film. I do want to disagree with some of the remarks, though.

 First, I would not call this a sports movie. It is not Rocky, Raging Bull, The Wrestler, or The Fighter. Warrior, according to many professional critics, is better than all of them, and I agree. There is the suspense factor of who will win the championship fight, for sure, and the stand-up-and-cheer factor as the opponents are picked off one by one, and there is the heartwarming factor as the school teacher tries to save his home from foreclosure. These cliches somehow are not relevant to this film and I salute O'Connor and the other writers for telling a story that glosses over them.

 As some reviewers have pointed out, this film is not really about MMA (mixed martial arts) winners and losers. Like others, I had never heard of MMA and don't like either boxing or wrestling (for me the former is just brutal beating and the second relies on a series of moves that I don't understand). But in this film MMA is choreographed so that you see the intensity and bruises on the fighters faces, the strain and pain on their arms, legs, and shoulders, but are not cringing at any blood and gore. There is no blood and gore in the cage (and probably that is what accounts for its PG-13 rating). As for the cinematography, the periodically trembling camera follows the fighters in close-ups, so you actually feel like you are standing in the ref's shoes. The score, which includes Ode to Joy and The National's About Today, is perfect.

 I think what really puts the gold on the five stars, though, is the caliber of acting. When the movie was made,over two years ago, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton were barely known to American audiences. O'Connor said he didn't want the performers to overshadow the characters, and with the anonymity of the actors, he would achieve that. He shouldn't have worried. The brothers, especially Hardy, completely disappear in the characters. Nolte not so much. His real life and his persona as Paddy Conlon are not so far apart, but I can't think of any other actor who could redeem this character with such pathos.

 As story-telling goes, Warrior is both a movie and a film. Nobody doesn't love Warrior. Teens will love it, the parent-sibling-sibling conflicts relatable. And the cage fighting will thrill them. In fact, the whole family will enjoy this, sitting on the edge of the seats, cheering, and tearing up sometimes simultaneously. By the way, it wasn't only the ladies tearing up a time or two. After the screening I attended, no one, man or woman, moved from their seats, the lights remained down, only some muted sniffling and discreet blowing of noses.

 For the arthouse crowd, there is profound metaphor embedded in the film. There are actually three warriors (fighters) in Warrior, and not one of them actually wins the war (the big fight). The brothers have not seen each other in 14 years, each of them feeling betrayed by the other at a crucial point in the life of the family. The one thing they have in common is hatred for their father, a former drunk and wife-beater. Brendan, the older son, has moved his own family as far away from Paddy as possible and still be in the same state. Communication must be had only by phone or mail. Tommy, an ex-Marine, shows up at his father's house, again after 14 years --but with zero communication-- and wants Paddy to train him for a big tournament. Why in the world, some would say, does Tommy go to his father for this. He hates him. Well, Paddy, also an ex-Marine and pro boxer, trained both Tommy and Brendan as boys. Tommy in wrestling, Brenden in boxing. But Tommy was a champion. Parallels permitted to be drawn. And so, because his motivation is so strong (and so poignant as we find out later), Tommy wants to be trained by the man who made him champion. Paddy hopes to revive this relationship, but Tommy is having none of it. Hardy absolutely seethes in his scenes with Nolte; every comment is a stab wound, every look a gunshot. Nolte takes it like a dog after he's been kicked. Coming back for the pat on the head. Scenes between these two are Oscar material, hands down.

 As the story develops, slowly, but with tantalizing bits of mystery in the plot, a lot of gaps are filled in. At the point where the two finalists, Tommy Riordan and Brendan Conlon (""They are brothers!"" the announcer shouts), enter the cage, we are so conflicted we want to cry (and we do). Then the script throws us a screwball(another shock, another jerk of a tear). Who the hell to cheer for?! There are no bad guys to fight! Just two alienated brothers who need to beat the crap out of each other in order to win the prize they need so desperately. And when the fight is over, it isn't really over. The end of the cage fight is gut-wrenching. No one wins. Not Tommy, not Brendan, not Paddy. A lot of people say the ""ending"" of the movie is predictable. Which ending is that? The knockout? The takedown? The tapout? And what exactly do each of those signify? Is there redemption for Paddy? Are there resolutions to the conflicts among the father and brothers?  What happens to Tommy, to Brendan, to Paddy, after the tournament ends?

Warrior will run your emotions ragged. High, low, and very few in-betweens. I think the movie will make the Best Films list, and it better get its nominations for Hardy and Nolte. I think Edgerton's quietly powerful performance is award worthy, too, but not in contention with the other two.  I hope audiences don't pass this film by because they think it's a violent fight movie or, for UFC fans, too tame. This is a jewel that should be treasured by everyone.",1316131200,217,5814,4.5876685934489405
4513505,5,B00505QA90,"I went to an advanced screening (my first) and I must feel the need to brag about how lucky I was to see it a week before everyone else has. The film itself is......wow. There really aren't that many films that make you feel like you are actually living the life of another individual alongside that person or persons, but this film does! The writing is absolutely great and realistic, with the characters' dialogue ingraining itself in your memory for days to come. It also paints an amazing and provoking story. Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) is a war hero who has just returned from service and looks to enter a MMA tournament, the prize of which is $5 million. At first, it appears that the reason he is doing this is just for pure activity and for fun, but it is eventually revealed that he wants to donate his prize to support the wife and children of his slain war buddy. The man has got some raw talent, due to the fact that his father, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) trained him in wrestling and martial arts for many years when he was young. He appears at his father's house to ask for him to train him again, but you can tell right away that there is some turbulent history between these two, because of Paddy's former alcoholism and abusiveness towards his wife and children. Paddy is almost 1,000 days sober now and looks to make amends and seek real forgiveness with Tommy, who makes it perfectly clear he doesn't have a father and only needs a trainer. Meanwhile, Brendan Colon (Joel Edgerton), Tommy's brother, is also adept in fighting due to being a former professional UFC player. Now he's a family man with a beautiful and supporting wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two daughters. He is having major financial problems and between him and his wife, they keep three jobs, with Brenden being a well-liked physics teacher at the local high school by day and a MMA fighter at a strip club parking lot event by night. Unfortunately, Brendan faces foreclosure on his house when he can't make ends meet because he gets suspended from his job when he keeps showing up to work with wounds and bruises. He decides the only way to fix things is to fight full-time, and eventually leads himself to the major tournament which his brother is also heading to. We learn over the course of the film that there are serious emotional issues between the two Conlon brothers and their father, and the film has many talky dramatic and extremely well-acted moments that reveal details and develop the journey for genuine retribution and forgiveness searched for by all three main characters. This is compunded when the brothers end up facing off with each other in the final match of the tournament and simultaneously draw the attention of an entire nation of people with their bout. The acting is absolutely incredible from every person involved and the level of realism that each person brings to their character is unbelievable. I have seen Tom Hardy being labeled as a young Marlon Brando, and it's easy to see why as he completely immerses himself in his role as a gritty tough-guy. He is definitely my favorite up-and-coming actor. Another favorite up-and-comer of mine is Joel Edgerton, who really makes you care for Brendan and sympathize with his troubles, but you also feel an amzing connection to both him and Tommy throughout the film. By far the most nuanced and well-acclaimed acting role in this film is that of Nick Nolte as Paddy who displays an amazing vulnerability and you really feel sorry for him as he strives to put all of his past mistakes right. Jennifer Morrison does a great job as Tess, Brendan's wife, and she really draws attention whenever she is in a scene. Gavin O' Connor's writing and directing also really make this film a triumph, and I hope he continues to make more films as soon as possible. The ending moments of the film are incredibly powerful and I found myself not knowing who I wanted to win the tournament out of the two brothers, but one of them does win, and I won't reveal who does obviously because you absolutely need to find that out for yourself when you watch the movie. Movies like ""Rocky"", ""Raging Bull"", and ""The Fighter"" are incredible peices of cinema, but in my personal opinion, I believe ""Warrior"" is a a movie that I enjoyed far more and I am labeling it my own personal favorite sports movie and it is the best movie period of 2011 so far. GO SEE IT!!! I have notified Amazon to tell me when the movie gets a release date for Blu-Ray so I can preorder it. I can't wait to add it to my collection!",1315180800,65,4551,4.585276073619632

8450739,4,B00505QA90,"I love movies. I really love movies that capture my attention early and continue to be entertaining until closing credits. Warrior does this. The Casting was great, acting really good, and fight scenes were awesome. I hit rewind 3x on the  you owe me 200.00 fight scene. I have been a big Nick Nolte fan, and I think this was his best work since Afflicted. Hardy and Edgerton have been long - established stars for a reason.
The fight scenes were great- especially the cage matches leading up to the final. Superb contrasting styles that personified the character development.
I also thought the supporting cast was fantastic. Wife, principal, mortgage banker, trainer, etc.
One of the best scenes i have ever seen was when Hardy took care of Nolte afte falling off the wagon. Great great great work. The final scene was a little predictable but still great-I thought it was Hardys beat Work in the film. I strongly encourage watching this movie. Great acting, really great fight scenes, and a superb cast that did amazing job driving the story throughout. Very entertaining.",1529280000,,1075,4.8743169398907105
