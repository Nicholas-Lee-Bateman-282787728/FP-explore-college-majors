7538452,5,B0181KOVMS,Grand daughter loves the series. The writing in this one is in Russian but since she loves the series and we have been watching it on Netflix it doesn't faze us. Also the credits are faster between episodes since it isn't in 3 different languages.,1456358400,,247,4.511111111111111
7538453,4,B0181KOVMS,"The upper part of the case was broked.
Maybe it was a long trip and rough journey to be arrived.
But the DVD was all right, it worked normally.
I love it.",1455580800,2,154,3.84375
7538454,5,B0181KOVMS,"My 3 Year old LOVES Masha and the Bear! The little girl is mischievous and adorable! He thinks she is hilarious! The animation is on point and the plots are really cute and funny! The songs are catchy and you will be humming them days later! I like that the animals don't have names they are called by what they are: bear, rabbit, etc.. And they don't talk. I highly recommend this 3D cartoon! This show kept my son laughing and happy on a 10 hour car ride! If you are looking for a good clean cartoon to let your children watch this is the one! The creators of Masha and the Bear did an amazing job! They created a thoughtful, cute, and funny cartoon! This is a must watch show for children of all ages.",1454630400,,704,4.1838235294117645
7538455,5,B0181KOVMS,This is a favorite with my toddlers. Just wish there were more episodes in English.,1454630400,,83,4.6
7538456,4,B0181KOVMS,It's just as described and came fairly quickly. It's different than the one on Netflix. The mouths aren't synced to English as well as the words on the objects (like the clocks and Calendar) are still foreign but my 2 year old doesn't know the difference and it's still Masha and the bear. I still would have bought it even if I knew this. It's the best price on the market still!,1454544000,3,380,4.291666666666667

7538459,5,B0181KOVMS,"These are possibly the funniest cartoons I have ever seen.  Despite the fact that they were created in Russia, the universal themes and the hilarity of the 3-year old little girl who is the main character make these a fun watch for adults as well as children.  I laugh out loud every time I watch these.  My 2-year old niece and nephew (twins) are enthralled by them and watch them constantly.",1451779200,2,393,4.507042253521127
8741117,5,B0181KOVMS,This was a wonderful find.  It is really hard to find a wonderful show for kids without all of the violence.  And my grandkids absolutely love this,1510444800,,147,4.407407407407407
8741118,5,B0181KOVMS,This movie is great we watch it  three to five times a day.  Would recommend it to anyone with a toddler.  I got it for my granddaughter's birthday.,1492473600,,148,4.214285714285714

8741125,2,B0181KOVMS,"My daughter loves this show but after watching 9 episodes on Netflix daily for two months, I was starting to hate it! (Wish is a shame because it really is a good show) So needless to say I was thrilled when I saw this DVD had 25 episodes. I did not look closely enough at the product descriptions. Each episode on the DVD is only approx 8 min long. The Netflix ""episodes"" are approx 25 min long because each contains 3 of the episodes on the DVD. Bottom line is that there were only one or two of the 8 min episodes on the DVD that are not on Netflix. The video quality is also quite crude. Especially when compared to Netflix. On the positive side, at least I'll have a copy if Netflix removes this show before my daughter's infatuation ends.",1460332800,8,744,4.246478873239437
8741126,5,B0181KOVMS,"Very happy with this!!! Now my kids are enjoying their favorite cartoon everywhere! I totally recomend this, cheap and good video quality!",1459036800,,138,5.318181818181818
