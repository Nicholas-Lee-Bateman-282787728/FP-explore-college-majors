8586089,5,B00CTMGIFI,"Firstly, I did not purchase this DVD so I am unable to comment on the quality of the actual DVD and any extras aside from the workout itself. I streamed the full workout on youtube and understand that it is exactly the same workout on this DVD. I just had to write this review to share how amazing this video is after I tried it.

By way of background, I was an avid Bikram Yoga practitioner for a few years when I was living in Australia. I have recently relocated to South East Asia and there isn't a Bikram (or any other Hot Yoga) studio in the city where I live. I have attempted practising Bikram Yoga at home with the official audio CD, but unfortunately, the editing of the CD is choppy at best, and I have found it very difficult to have a smooth flowing session with it. I stumbled upon Absolute Hot Yoga by chance a few weeks ago and I must say that I didn't have high hopes as I have long set my mind that Bikram is the best yoga for me. Since the video is available on youtube and Absolute Hot Yoga's website offers a free download of the audio version of the workout, I thought I'd give it a go anyway as I have been desperate for some good yoga for a few months now. I practised without heat my first few times (normal room temperature here being around 32 to 33 celcius) and I was really pleasantly surprised. As another reviewer has commented, the poses are similar to Bikram, but there are additional poses and the sequencing is different. The 50 poses flowed beautifully and I did not feel like I was missing out although the Bikram breathing exercises and two postures (half locust and spine twist) were not included in this sequence. I felt the same sense of satisfaction after completing this workout as I used to feel after each Bikram class. I also had a good night's sleep after my practice and nice sore muscles the next morning, both familiar aftermaths of a Bikram class.

With my past experience, I found it quite easy to follow the video and plan to shift to using just the audio download in the near future. The video is very well made, the instructor's voice is soothing and very clear. The audio download is from the exact same workout and I must say that it has far better flow compared to my Bikram CD, which I don't think I will be reaching for anymore.

If you are someone looking to try hot yoga, or any type of yoga actually, I would highly recommend that you give this video a try. It is meant to be a 90-minute workout like Bikram, but this video clocks in at around 80 minutes. A reviewer has mentioned that it is not suitable for beginners. As previously noted, I do have some hot yoga experience and did not find it difficult to follow. I can understand how a complete beginner with no experience in yoga at all may struggle following through with the many postures, but the instructions on this video are really quite clear so I wouldn't completely strike it off the list for beginners. Hope that helps :)",1441065600,,2949,4.348457350272232

8586091,5,B00CTMGIFI,Very close to bikram. But it has more poses! I love it so much. Because it does most poses twice. I wish they would give the option of a 45 minute version or a hour. And just do them once. Sometimes I just don't have the 90 minutes. Love it though.,1406332800,2,248,3.8823529411764706
8586092,2,B00CTMGIFI,"Not at all good for beginners!!!  There was little to no direction on poses - and as I ve come to learn, Hot Yoga is intense and needs to be slowly done (like any other exercise discipline).  Also, the ""chart"" included needed a magnifying glass to see and did little in the way of explaining!  I also purchased The Barkan Method and found this much better!",1395446400,,356,4.363636363636363
8586093,5,B00CTMGIFI,"What an excellent DVD. Clear, safe, precise dialogue which anyone can follow and scale down to their own needs. Overall this is an excellent yoga practice in general which works out all areas of the body. It also incorporates the most important aspect of breathing with the movement. You can't go wrong with this DVD.",1382918400,6,317,4.781818181818182
