867043,4,6304411367,"I found this movie because I'm a Joanna Burns fan (if you don't know here look her up!) Add Tony Curtis, the gorgeous Cladia Cardinale and introducing Sharon Tate as a sexy beach dwelling skydiver and my interest spilled over. Absolutely fun movie with a touch of Mel Brooks farce and Irwin Allen Disaster. The story is a bit off but it's great fun to watch.

Claudia is ultra cute , and her clumsiness and lack of English fluency are extra big pluses for her attractiveness .  There are a lot of unexpected funny complications between the characters .  Other aspects I enjoyed are the introduction of Sharon and Dave , the fantastic trampoline acrobatics , and the surprise spectacular ending which was way-clever .  I am still asking myself , ' How did they do that ? '  I am going to hold on to this one because I am sure I will want to watch it again in a few months .",1419033600,2,654,4.276422764227642

Never mind the incongrruity because the gags are funny and the women are luscious...Claudia Cardinale and Sharon Tate (who says little but has a lot of screen time for visibility).  Robert Webber plays the unfortunate semi-villain foil.
There is a massive mudslide and I can't determine if it all special effects or if they actually had footage of a real Malibu mudslide.

867171,3,6304411367,"I bought this DVD because I am a big Dave Draper fan. I have met him and his wife in person a couple years ago and they are both very nice, down to earth people.
I saw the movie when it came out in the sixties and couldn't believe how Big they made Dave look. He is about 6 ft tall.
As to the rest of the movie, it was ok, but as with all things movies have generally gotten better in the last 40 years. This one was really just so so",1386201600,,434,3.6774193548387095
867311,4,6304411367,"I am a major Sharon Tate fan which is why I bought this. Its an entertaining if slightly bizarre take where Tony Curtis comes to LA and is stripped of all his worldly good by Claudia Cardinale who is extremely accident prone. The plot spirals upwards and downwards from there. He is then Hit on the head and then revived by Sharon Tate as a surfer/skydiver who looks gorgeous but must have a page of dialogue in the whole movie. It's a bizarre comedy, very unusual with a couple of unexpected twists. I wasn't expecting much from this but fans of Curtis/Tate and Cardinale will love it and it has a very groovy soundtrack by Vic Mizzy.",1378598400,2,635,4.435897435897436
867312,1,6304411367,"Although Tony Curtis was a wonderful actor, who was always fun to watch,  this movie is terrible.  Kind of creepy this is the first movie introducing Sharon Tate, who, the most memorable scene was her jumping on a trampoline.  This movie does not hold up over time, and your not sure what generation it was made for....the older 1950s Frank Sinatra crowd or the new late 1960s rock and roll/ surfer crowd.  It has no appeal to either or anyone else.  Honestly, I only bought the movie because it was stated (on another website)  that filming was done in South Carolina.  It was filmed in California, not in the east.

Seller:  This movie was as described and shipped promptly, and was new.  The seller was a good seller.",1377734400,2,720,4.5546875

867316,5,6304411367,"I love this movie for stunningly beautiful Sharon Tate who has far too little appearances in it - wish she had a larger role in it. But the scenes in which she does appear do feel like magic - she always has the air of a fairy like creature, so heartbreakingly beautiful, and yet remote, not really there, elusive - no idea how she did that...
So I did buy the movie just because of the Californian beach fairy she impersonated here, although the whole movie is just great with a cute Tony Curtis and a very italian Caudia Cardinale - and has this wonderful typical 60ies mood...
Great movie, and btw - the DVD arrived in perfect condition, too.",1350518400,5,645,4.383333333333334

867318,3,6304411367,"This is an odd film, not as stinging as other Southern California satires (The Loved

867319,5,6304411367,"What do you get when you mix a conniving Tony Curtis as a shady grifter with an accident on two legs like Claudia Cardinelli in a plot that involves beach front house along a gorgeous stretch of Malibu Beach? The kind of outrageous pandemonium that only a Hollywood screenwriter could imagine. Yet it is also an interesting character study of a number of individual minor characters, and it is this aspect of the film that makes its histrionics and dumb jokes somehow more palatable. Watch for the scenes with the late and beautiful Sharon Tate and big bodybuilder Dave Draper, who ignite on screen together in a sweet and almost innocent way in front of the camera. Big Dave never made a career in films, but this movie shows he could act, and that he had a unique sort of charisma on-screen at that. I save this one for cold winter nights when my California dreaming is at a fever pitch. I always seem to enjoy it. I hope you will too.",1309996800,10,937,4.453488372093023
867320,5,6304411367,"[Don't Make Waves - (1967) - Widescreen presentation]  I'm loving the Warner Bros. Archive Collection, as it gives a small but rabid audience the ability to see films from bygone days that there's only a small market for today. I'm not loving the pricing, however, but patience has its rewards, because sooner or later the prices do drop somewhat, making them accessible without feeling like you're getting hosed. At least not with a water cannon.

And speaking of water, 'Don't Make Waves' is a solid screwball comedy from the latter half of the 60's that still has its charm, warmth and humor intact, unlike some films from this era that haven't aged as well. Although it's being falsely promoted as a Sharon Tate vehicle, the stars are Tony Curtis and Claudia Cardinale, both of whom shine and make this one worth watching. Tony Curtis is perfectly restrained here, unlike some of his over-reaching comedies that occasionally become grating, and the shorter leash suits him perfectly. Claudia Cardinale is absolutely adorable as the Italian 'kept' woman of style who's got a feisty temper and is a bit clumsy in her driving skills, starting a chain of events that snowball steadily until the end credits roll. Not typically recognized for her comedic skills, she's captivating in every scene she's in, even stealing some laughs from Curtis overtly. And the colorful outfits she sports look fantastic on her well-tanned European endowments. Fans of Preston Sturges and Howard Hawks' screwball comedies from the 30's and 40's should enjoy this film, as well as anyone who enjoys 60's films and nostalgia - the fashion, dcor and Southern California shoreline are all vivid visual feasts displayed to bedazzle.

And speaking of visual feasts and bedazzlement, Sharon Tate is the epitome of American beach beauty - she's jaw-droppingly gorgeous in a bikini and is the divinity of the female form. Her face appears flawless, her hair radiant, her movements bewitching and resplendent, deserving of a goddess' pedestal. Captivating beyond belief, it's hard to pay attention to anything else when she is onscreen. She doesn't have many lines to speak, but who's complaining? She gets enough screentime to leave a permanant mark... If she were eye-candy, your eyes would rot in their sockets...

Clever, breezy, sexy and funny, this underrated and engaging comedy is highly recommended, so jump right in, the water's fine.",1307750400,33,2416,5.108860759493671

867431,4,6304411367,"This is one movie that everyone can enjoy. It's very funny and well-acted. Tony Curtis is so over-looked, and this movie is just another example of what a talented performer he is. Comedy was always Curtis' greatest strength and he plays it well here. But the movie is an excellent vehicle for Sharon Tate. Cast in the perfect role as a stunning bikini-clad beach goddess, Tate shows she has a talent for comedy as she plays the foil to Curtis' well-honed chops. All and all, this one is a delightful romp and worthy of an audience.",1254096000,2,532,4.552083333333333

867433,5,6304411367,"very enjoyable, fast-paced feel-good flick from the mid sixties. The Mort Sahl scene is priceless! I don't understand why it's not out on dvd. Looking at the exorbitant amounts being asked for VHS versions, you'd think there would be a market for a dvd release with perhaps some extras like a Tony Curtis commentary.",1248825600,2,316,4.87037037037037
867434,4,6304411367,"I recorded this off TCM last week, mostly because I saw it had an appearance by Sharon Tate from the same year she did ""The Fearless Vampire Killers.""  Which is, of course, a perfectly good reason to see any movie.

And while there's a fair amount here to satisfy people who just want to see Tate -- specifically some long, strange shots of her in a bikini bouncing endlessly on a beachside trampoline -- there's a lot more going on here.

""Waves"" is basically a rake's progress tale as stammering, backstory-free Tony Curtis arrives in California and charms/scams his way to the top of a Malibu swimming pool empire.

Along the way he meets the aforementioned Tate (as a vacant but intrepid skydiver named ... Malibu); an accident-prone, broken-English-spouting Claudia Cardinale who destroys Curtis' little VW and then helps him stage his comeback; her sugar daddy (Robert Webber); his angry, voluptuous wife (a criminally underutilized Joanna Barnes); a queeny, crooked astrologer; future Mr. Universe David Draper; and, oddly enough, Jim Backus who, in an almost Charlie Kaufman-esque scene, plays himself and offers to do Mr. Magoo voice readings for Curtis at the promise of a free pool.

It even has an animated opening sequence (depicting Curtis' VW on an antic world tour) with music by The Byrds.

Basically, this is one of those glossy, widescreen, Metrocolor sexless sex farce confections from the waning days of the studio system -- Benjamin Braddock had to live somewhere nearby, but had he wandered into the story, the universe probably would've collapsed into itself.

What's odd, though, is that this was made by director Alexander Mackendrick exactly 10 years after he and Curtis made ""The Sweet Smell of Success"" together. Mackendrick doesn't have material by Lehman and Odets this time; the script is by one writer (Maurice Richlin) responsible for Inspector Clouseau and ""Operating Petticoat,"" another (George Kirgo) who'd just penned the Elvis Presley epic ""Spinout,"" and -- should it even be a surprise -- an uncredited Terry Southern.

Obviously, ""Success"" is the classic acid indictment of fame and corruptive ambition and the sting of betrayal. That film had its stark black-and-white photography, its potent and bustling New York aesthetic, its whip-cracking dialogue and a genuine taste of bile in its mouth. Which makes it not so much the *opposite* of the sunny, West Coast ""Waves,"" but a reversed or negative image of it. It's Bizarre-O ""Success.""

And one of the reasons ""Waves"" is interesting is because you can tell there's some kind of force behind it, you can smell a whiff of satire beyond its heavy seabreeze, perfume and cigar smoke. But those aromas never quite waft to the forefront. The movie is intelligent and somewhat literate without ever actually being smart; witty without ever really being funny; and fairly sexy without ever attempting to even acknowledge the ramifications of its own weird carnality.

But it's also strangely paced and rambling without ever really being boring. As a result, I think it's a fascinating movie, even though the awkward slapstick grows tiresome and leads to a conclusion in which all the characters wind up in the same valley bachelor pad together and find themselves swept up in a SoCal landslide. But even then, it's hard not to admire the strange elaborate detail of ... the film's disaster effects (!). Yep, this is a bedroom farce in which Cardinale at one point literally has to leap for her life while a lavish patio crumbles under her feet. You can't tell me that doesn't have something to do with something besides the general plot.

By the way: I'm reviewing the VHS version of this only because there's no DVD. Don't buy the tape, though, the compositions will of course get killed by the pan-and-scan.",1181174400,2,3794,5.015898251192369
867435,5,6304411367,"After the rotund success of ""Someone like it hot"", this is perhaps, the most provocative satire  about then lives and times of South California around a beautiful house that will become a particular hell. The cast is incredibly good.

Don't miss it!",1151798400,,249,4.904761904761905
867436,5,6304411367,"Don't Make Waves is an enchanting oddity from the UK director Alexander Mackendrick who made THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS and many previous British comedies with Alec Guinness and the like.  And underneath its hip, mod clothing DON'T MAKE WAVES shares with the Ealing comedies many similar views towards the world and its neurotic inhabitants.  What everyone looks at first, of course, is the talent, including Claudia Cardinale in an amazing array of outfits and sunglasses and more eye makeup than she had ever worn before.  Then there was the card that says ""Introducing Sharon Tate,"" who takes your breath away with her glamor and her exotic looks.  She is rather like Bo Derek in ""10"" even wearing the same kind of bikini in her entrance.  With Robert Webber in both movies, 10 and Don't Make Waves, the similarity is very striking.  Here Webber plays the husband cheating on Joanna Barnes with a Malibu mistress (Cardinale, very kittenish and charming, and confused about what she wants out of life).  Tony Curtis is all right, but for some reason you could watch the whole movie and never find out who he is and why he came to California.  You keep expecting him to reveal something about his past and he never does.

The Byrds' title song isn't one of their strongest numbers but the twangy guitars and patented harmonies announce right away, as soon as the MGM lion has roared, that we are in Southern California and everything is just a dream away.

The climactic landslide reminds me of a later pair of California films that both try to sum everything up, Altman's SHORT CUTS and Anderson's MAGNOLIA.  You'll see why!

Most of all the movie belongs to David Draper, the bodybuilder who was Mr. Universe, as many of the other reviewers here on Amazon have noted.  Draper plays Harry, willing to give up sex to get better ""glutes.""  He is a very sweet, amazingly good actor whom Mackendrick gives many of the movie's best moments.  David Draper's own website has a contemporary article about his appearance in DON'T MAKE WAVES, with a staged photo of himself and Cardinale looking as though they were playing Rusty and Myra in MYRA BRECKINRIDGE.

All in all, it's a wonderful picture with a great performance by David Draper.",1094515200,6,2232,4.7734375
867437,4,6304411367,"This is your typical empty-headed surfer dude/chick movie with Sharon Tate playing the part of a beach bunny who practically lives at the beach (along her other ""job"" - a skydiver).  She looked absolutely fantastic (as always) but it was sad to see how few lines she had throughout the film (if she had two full pages of script, it would have been a miracle).

Tony Curtis played the part of a guy who was moving to California and winds up losing all his posessions in one fell swoop on his first day there and moves in with Claudia Cardinale's character (who lives high thanks to her sugar daddy).  He winds up selling pools for a living.

Although the movie is cute, the plot isn't complicated at all.  It seemed as though Curtis and Claudinale didn't have anything else to do at the time and Tate was contracted to perform here.

I enjoyed this but, when it comes to seeing Sharon's comedic ability shine, ""The Wrecking Crew"" is a whole lot better.",1053907200,6,951,4.5

867439,4,6304411367,"This really is a pretty good little movie, it's just too bad it's been so overlooked.  It's just plain FUN.  Perfect 60's mind candy.  The music's pretty good, the cinematography is A1, and the performances are all good.  I'm no Tony Curtis fan, but he's really good here.  Playing a self-serving  opportunist you still can't help but like him.  Ironically, he utters the  film's best line""If you look at things realistically you'll never fall  in love.  You just eliminate everyone you can't stand, and see who's  left-if anyone"".  Claudia Cardinale is magnifico as the accident-prone  Laura.  Not only is she beautiful, she's a fine comedienne too boot.  Robert Webber and Joanna Barnes step into their roles of the bickering  married couple as if they were written especially for them.  They truly  make these roles their own.  David Draper is oddly appealing as the  dim-witted muscleman Harry.  He actually makes you care about him, giving a  lot more depth than usual to such a throwaway part.  But the film really  belongs to Sharon Tate.  She steals every scene she's in effortlessly, and  she also looks pretty damn good in a bikini too.  In the skydiving sequence  when she tells Carlo(Curtis' character) to ""hold on tight"" he  looks as if he's more than happy to oblige.  He looks as if he's died and  gone to heaven.  Somehow I couldn't help wondering how much real acting he  did in the scene.  You'd have to be a eunuch not to react to her.  I had  trouble with the landslide sequence at first, but it makes perfect sense.  All the plots loose threads are effectively tied up here.  Rod and  Diane(Webber and Barnes) are able to come to a new understanding of each  other.  Harry and Malibu(Draper and Tate) are reunited, their love stronger  than ever.  And after an hour and a half of fighting it Carlo and  Laura(Cardinale) finally stop fighting it and realize they were really  meant for each other.  If you look at it, there's a real twinge of irony  in the ending.  In the beginning Carlo is effectively wiped out by the  hapless Laura. Figuratively speaking. (He's also literally wiped out by  Malibu. But that's another sequence)In the end he's still a pauper, with  Laura  at least partially to blame.  Yet he doesn't seem to mind at all  this time.  You'll like this movie.  I promise",948412800,28,2308,4.703797468354431
