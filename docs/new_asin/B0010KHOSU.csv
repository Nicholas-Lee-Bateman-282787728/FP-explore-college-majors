3049263,5,B0010KHOSU,"Three new film noirs and a weepy double feature---what more could you want for a late winter's evening (or evenings) entertainment? Some of the noirs are weepy, and some of the weepies are noirs, so it gets a little confusing. The one genuine, dyed-in-the-wool noir is 1953's Dangerous Crossing, coming in at a taught 76 minutes. Jeanne Crain plans to spend her honeymoon on a luxury liner with new hubby Carl Betz; problem is, hubby disappears within minutes of boarding, and all the signs point to him never existing. Kindly ship's doctor Michael Rennie straightens it all out, with a goodly number of thrills along the way. Black Widow is less successful a noir, despite the starry cast of Ginger Rogers, Van Heflin, Gene Tierney and George Raft. Set in the celebrity driven world of the New York theatre circa 1954,
an ambitious young author uses her wiles to get ahead to little avail, as someone offs her halfway through the film, it's a whodunit that degenerates into a who cares. The main characters aren't drawn sharply enough, and the plot seems oddly discombobulated. With the exception of Heflin, the stars are somewhat past their prime and seem, unfortunately, a bit seedy However, Daisy Kenyon is the pick of the litter, despite it being squarely a Joan Crawford weepy rather than a noir. A love triangle with Crawford, Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda deftly directed by Otto Preminger, one in a long line of her female leads making her way with pluck and honor in a man's world. It's black and white, it rains a lot, and there are some great atmospheric shots, but a film noir it ain't. There are also vintage scenes of mid-century Provincetown, and former Cape resident Ruth Warrick plays Andrew's beleaguered wife; despite Preminger's earlier great noirs such as Laura and Whirlpool, this really is a weepy.
The weepy double feature from Universal consists of Portrait in Black and Madame X, both starring Lana Turner and produced by that sultan of excess, Ross Hunter. Hunter's reality had little relationship to anyone else's; his was a world of the rich or near rich, beautiful or near beautiful, with lots of jewels and Jean Louis gowns, where there were no small emotions, only large, operatic, over-the-top scenes. Portrait in Black is a noir, albeit a noir in blazing color that his nothing to do with the low, cheap detective thrillers we all know and love. Turner and Anthony Quinn kill off her ailing husband Lloyd Nolan, and somebody knows their dirty little secret. Is it bubbly Sandra Dee, pert John Saxon, crusty Ray Walston or the ever mysterious Anna May Wong? And, as weepy par excellance, little can be said about Madame X, other than a profound and astonished, ""wow!"" Turner, as the poor but honest wife of super rich John Forsythe, is blackmailed by her evil mother-in-law, Constance Bennett, into leaving him and their baby, who, as he grows up to be Keir Dullea, might not be such a bad idea on the face of it. Later, Lana's accused of murder and her lawyer is---you guessed it---Dullea, who has no idea that he's defending his mom. You know, they simply are not making films like this any more. We may all be better off.",1205798400,2,3157,4.762773722627737
3049264,3,B0010KHOSU,"As I write this review, there have been two reviews of this film posted here, each of which gave it five stars.  I enjoyed the movie, but I have to say that five stars is a little over-exuberant for this particular movie.  I would reserve that sort of rating for a Casablanca, The Lady Vanishes, Duck Soup, and quite a few others, but I don't think those who made this movie intended it to be an undying work of cinema art, and so I'm giving it three stars, recognizing it as a solid, workmanlike product churned out by the studio system in (as the special features on the DVD point out several times), just nineteen days of shooting.

Let me be a little more specific.  I'm going to limit what I say to a certain extent, because this is a film based on a story by John Dickson Carr, the master of ""locked room"" mysteries, and a large part of the film's dramatic energy stems from the fact that the story starts out with one of those seemingly impossible situations -- the young, starry-eyed bride boards the ocean liner with her wonderful new husband, only to have him disappear within minutes after boarding, and to have no one else on board the ship acknowledge that he ever existed.  (Similar in some ways to The Lady Vanishes, mentioned above as a five-star effort of this sort by Mr. Hitchcock.)

Anyway, I am honor-bound not to write any spoilers, and I won't.  What I will say is that the film is very well made.  The special features point out that this movie used sets left over from the ""Titanic"" film of that era, so the quality of the shipboard scenes is quite good from a technical point of view.  The acting and direction are fine, and the movie is very short and to the point.  There is a good air of mystery, and we, the viewers, are left wondering what on earth (sea, I should say) is going on until a ""reveal"" moment by a villain about halfway through.  (I hope that wasn't a spoiler, but, yes, there is at least one villain; it wasn't all just a big mistake.)

My main criticism isn't really anything negative -- the movie is well done for what it is.  What it is, in my opinion, is a good example of the films cranked out like sausages back in the days before television caught on.  I'm a bit too young to remember, but I believe the movies changed at least once per week in those days, and there often were double features.  This would not have been a bill-topper.  It strikes me as a woman-oriented melodrama, with a plot and style bearing hallmarks of the mass-produced romance novel -- young woman in grave jeopardy on board a ship; no one is listening to her, except a tall, dark, and handsome doctor (Michael Rennie), who is attentive, suave, and warm. There is not much in the way of subtlety or complexity in the film.  There is an effective build-up of suspense, and some fairly standard ""shocks"" from bumping into things or hearing strange noises, or doors creaking, but nothing that really resonates as having great artistic merit.

Also, although I'm not at liberty to discuss them with those of you who haven't yet seen the film, I saw what I believe to be fairly obvious holes in the plot.  A story like this by definition has to be somewhat contrived, in order to set up the seemingly impossible situation, but, once the solution was revealed, I had to ask myself how that solution would have been possible, practically speaking.  In other words, how could the villain(s) have pulled that off, realistically. The movie does not do a great job of explaining the solution in any detail.

But, I have no regrets at having bought and watched the DVD.  The movie is very nicely transferred to DVD; both audio and video are fine, and the featurette on the making of the film, with Jeanne Crain's grand-daughter and others, was quite informative.  The movie is a good, entertaining diversion for a rainy afternoon, but it rates no more than a solid three stars.",1205625600,29,3890,4.486524822695036

3049267,5,B0010KHOSU,"Having found this gem of a mystery movie, by accident I am thrilled to own it. I watch it frequently. It has a strong educational value. Namely, it emphasizes the value of trust versus infatuation with comparative object of lost affection/love. We know that trust is vital to our well-being, health of our ego. This is what this movie deals with. It is very real and is very well directed. Also an excellent screenplay. Jeanne Crain is so seriously embroidered in a web of her character and plays convincingly. A journey with her through entire movie is also a dress rehearsal of the best kind. She has a beauty that compliments every piece of her attire.
 Michael Rennie is a very real discovery for me. But what a discovery it is! He had me riveted to his characters' action packed, at times dangerous too, very challenging for an actor, display of high craftsmanship standard.

Yes, there are some ""holes"" in the story but they don't detract from the overall enjoyment of this classic.

Jeanne Crain is one of my fav actresses from that era. So beautiful and such a perfect choice for this part too. The whole cast was well chosen.

To think that this film was made in 19 DAYS and at a cost of less than a million dollars, is amazing too! Something that wouldn't happen now.

The quality of the filming was what really stood out for me. You really did feel like you were on a ship, not watching actors on sets, it was so well done in this regard.

3049286,3,B0010KHOSU,"Out In The 1950s Film Noir Night- Jeanne Crain's Dangerous Crossing

You really should be wary of whirlwind romances, quick romances that end in marriage, and maybe danger. No I am not an old spoilsport, a naysaying in matters of the heart, but unless you know somebody for a while, get a feel for what they are about, get that ""under your skin"" feeling then back off, back off a little. You just never know when some guy or gal might be a gold-digger just looking to get fat and sassy at your expense.

Take the lovely Ruth (played by Jeanne Crain) in the 1950s film noir mystery under review, Dangerous Crossing, she was feeling blue after the sudden death of her rich father and grabbed onto the nearest Johnnie around, took the whirlwind, and then the marriage plunge. If she had taken my advice, or had this John Bowman (played by Carl Betz) guy who swept her off her feet checked out she could have saved herself a lot of angst and anguish. But no she took the plunge, clueless, and then went on a honeymoon cruise that took the starch out of everything.

Now your average ship cruise, until lately anyway, is pretty uneventful, just food, booze and shuffleboard. But from about minute one this turned out to be the cruise from hell and Ruth's life was upended. The loving couple (knowing each other for all of four weeks), Ruth and John, boarded the ship and then John took a powder, went missing. Ruth, a little unstable due to the father's death, was frantic. She looked everywhere, asked everybody about his whereabouts, making a general nuisance of herself in the process. Nobody seemed to believe her story denying that this John was on board.  She was ultimately medical help by one Doctor Manning (played by Michael Rennie) but was looked at by one and all as a looney.

But here is the funny thing this John was on board, had a confederate on board (okay, his real honey, but that's still a confederate isn't it), and had created an elaborate hoax to do away with Ruth and grab her dough. Now you know in these film noir things, particularly 1950s noir, that the main point driven home is that crime does not pay so you know that, elaborate hoax or not, this Johnnie is doomed. Watch the film is find out how. Oh yah, and be careful, very careful the next time you have a whirlwind romance. Enough said.",1382572800,,2318,4.496437054631829

3049291,3,B0010KHOSU,"Based on a stage play by mystery writer John Dickson Carr, Dangerous Crossing is a short suspense film with excellent casting and acting, outstanding direction and photography, and a couple or so plot holes so large that even Titanic could have sailed through without scraping her hull. A newlywed couple board an ocean liner and the husband goes off to run an errand, never to be seen again. The wife is presented with evidence and testimony that she is actually unmarried and booked a solo passage. But the husband contacts her secretly with a warning they are both in danger, and the ship's doctor is skeptical of her story but still feels there is something strange in the works. The taut and economical screenplay -- ignoring plot holes -- is skillfully written and expertly performed by a cast of fine actors who include Jean Crain and Michael Rennie as the wife and doctor, Max Showalter as a ship's officer, Willis Bouchey as the Captain, and several others who don't get credited. Oh, and Carl Betz as the husband, and in this case definitely not the husband from the Donna Reed Show. When it's all said and done, it's a bit amazing that so much could be crammed into just an hour and a quarter. So what about those plot holes? They mainly involve the need to keep a conspiracy secret and a ruse convincing, and success depends too much on coincidence and contrivance. Still, at the end those problems faded away for me, obscured by the otherwise solid movie-making this film represents.",1357516800,,1496,4.713740458015267

3049295,4,B0010KHOSU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Click on the DVD special features and you'll learn a few interesting things about 'Dangerous Crossing'. First off, it only took 19 days to film; and it cost about $500,000 which was less than half of what Twentieth Century Fox was paying for their 'A' blockbusters such as 'Titanic', which also was released around the same time in 1953. Speaking of 'Titanic', a good number of the sets from that film were used in 'Crossing' along with a pool set from 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes', another 'A' feature, also released in 1953. By using the sets from those other more expensive films, this was a big reason why the producers of 'Dangerous Crossing' were able to have the film made on the cheap as well as shoot it on such a short schedule.

'Dangerous Crossing' is a taut, little mystery with an ocean cruise as its setting. Jeanne Crain plays Ruth Stanton Bowman who just got married a day before and is off on her honeymoon with John Bowman (played by Carl Betz, known for his stint on TV's 'Donna Reed Show' a few years later). Once the couple boards the ship and settles into their cabin, the story takes a real spooky twist, reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode. John disappears and the crew has no record of him being on the passenger manifest. Ruth starts to panic and the ship's captain orders the ship's physician, Paul Manning (played by the erudite Michael Rennie), to basically keep tabs on her. It appears that Ruth is off her rocker but the captain goes by the book and orders a search of the ship with negative results.

The tension in the plot keeps rising as Ruth receives a mysterious call from John who warns her that both of them are in great danger and he'll have to contact her later. The call makes Ruth even more frantic as she basically begins running around the ship conducting her own investigation. At a certain point, Ruth realizes that if she continues to act hysterically and fails to contain her anger, the doctor will be forced by the captain to confine her to her quarters. So she begins pretending that her story about coming on board with her husband, is simply a figment of her imagination (an idea suggested to her by Dr. Manning).

Ruth's paranoia is exacerbated when she encounters various fellow passengers and crew members all who seem quite menacing in her eyes. One passenger in particular sends her into a tailspin and that's this older German gentleman who walks with a limp and carries a cane. Of course he's just there (like most of the other crew and passengers) to throw the audience off the scent.

After Dr. Manning shows Ruth a telegram from the Bureau of Investigation on the mainland that her personal physician and housekeeper know nothing about her getting married, Ruth confesses that she kept the marriage a secret. It seems she had a reason to fear someone might be after her and her new husband: right before her father died, he left her the family business--cutting out the father's half-brother who threatened the father in the event that he planned to disinherit him.

Ruth experiences her 'dark moment the soul' when she encounters John on the deck and he runs away from her. In an excellent scene, she runs into the dining room and in a fit of paranoia, faints after she believes the crew members are all coming after her. The ship's captain immediately confines her to her quarters and her fears of being branded a lunatic have come true. Soon we learn that she hasn't been crazy after all. In the climactic scene, one of the ship's officers (who has been feigning illness and has been on sick leave) turns out to have impersonated Ruth's husband. Since Ruth has been confined to quarters and the ship will dock the next day, 'Bowman' attempts to strangle Ruth and throw her overboard, to make it look like she committed suicide. Manning intercepts Ruth's would-be killer and he ends up getting caught in a rope and falls overboard.

Up until the ending, 'Dangerous Crossing' is a highly entertaining mystery which keeps the audience continually guessing as to the outcome. The outcome however has one main problem. If 'Bowman' had been successful, he couldn't have claimed Ruth's inheritance since it would have shed light on his whole plot to kill her. It appears that 'Bowman' was really working with Ruth's father's half-brother who probably had paid 'Bowman' to do Ruth in. So it would have been much better if 'Bowman' mentioned this to Ruth as he's about to strangle her--he could have said something to the effect, 'Remember that uncle of yours--well, he and I had a little deal. Now, I hope you finally get it.""

Most of the performances in 'Dangerous Crossing' are quite good but I did feel Jeanne Crain could have kept some of those histrionics under wrap. I'm referring especially to all those fainting spells every time she ends up receiving some kind of bad news. Also I found Dr. Manning to be remarkably patient (as well as Captain Peters) in dealing with the oftentimes hysterical Ruth. I know the staff of a cruise ship must be patient and courteous to the passengers, but would crew members today be as patient with someone like Ruth, who had a continual problem in controlling her anger?

'Dangerous Crossing' is a surprisingly well-made 'B' film noir. Particularly impressive is the cinematography in which a multitude of close-ups are utilized to a most efficacious effect.",1292630400,,5403,4.727176220806794

Michael Rennie and especially the absolutely attractive Jeanne Crain were magnificent in this lovely Fox film noir gem. I'd go as far as saying Jeanne nearly deserved an Oscar nomination for her role..........she played the part superbly and her acting skills came to the fore here (I don't know how people can question her acting abilities)!! as she completely shone all the way through, and looked so beautiful and sexy too.

The only downside for me was the slightly ""contrived"" ending. I know the story of the movie was originally taken from a novel, but a slightly more adventurous ending  would have given the movie the whole magical 5 stars............but still a very good 4 out of 5.",1274832000,,884,4.7272727272727275

3049299,4,B0010KHOSU,"Gene Tierney might have been the reigning female star of noir at Fox, but Jeanne Crain certainly gives Tierney a run for her money in the sublime ""locked room"" mystery DANGEROUS CROSSING, one of her last major movies before leaving the studio in 1953.

In DANGEROUS CROSSING, Jeanne Crain plays Ruth, the lovely if ever-so-slightly unstable wife of John Bowman (Carl Betz).  Their honeymoon cruise hits a snag when the groom promptly ""disappears"" just as the boat launches.  Frantic Ruth appeals for help from passengers and crew members alike but the story is always the same: they don't recall seeing Ruth with anyone, let alone a husband.  Concerned Dr. Manning (Michael Rennie) takes the shattered woman under his wing; and he's determined to discover the real cause of Ruth's ""delirium"".  But no-one, much less Ruth, will be able to understand the true motives behind the vanished husband.

Economically filmed in only nineteen days using the pre-existing ship sets built for the 1953 Fox production of ""Titanic"", DANGEROUS CROSSING is a testament to the professionalism of Jeanne Crain--who was battling a 'flu during the shoot--that she was able to flesh out such a believable character in a short amount of time, delivering one of her finest performances in the process.  Ruth in DANGEROUS CROSSING is right up there with ""Pinky"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"" and ""A Letter to Three Wives"".

The ""locked room"" mystery movie is a great example of a successful noir sub-genre; other movies with the same theme include Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"", 1932's ""Midnight Warning"", and the underrated masterpiece ""So Long at the Fair"" starring Jean Simmons and Dirk Bogarde (still sadly-unavailable on DVD--hello, Criterion!).  DANGEROUS CROSSING was based on a popular radio play by John Dickson Carr entitled ""Cabin B-13"".

The DVD includes a wonderful new Making Of featurette (""Peril at Sea: Charting a Dangerous Crossing""), audio commentary with Aubrey Solomon, isolated musical score track, interactive galleries and the trailer; plus sneak peeks at similar titles in the Fox Film Noir collection.

Highly recommended.",1257292800,3,2119,5.258160237388724

There's no indication she came aboard with anyone. Their suite is empty and her baggage is in another room. The crew starts believing she's delusional--even the sympathetic doctor, played by Michael Rennie (The Day the Earth Stood Still). He spends a lot of time with her (who wouldn't), trying to cure her of her hallucinations and hysteria. The fog-shrouded nights help build the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia, which grows steadily thicker before finally lifting at the denouement.

3049302,5,B0010KHOSU,"Dangerous Crossing is one of the best thriller/mysteries I've seen to date. It was actually filmed in a mere nineteen days although you'd never guess it! Jeanne Crain was highly intelligent and put everyone to the task of keeping up with her; and the result was wonderful. Yes, the ship's foghorn sounds too much during the early half of this film; but it's all atmospheric and despite just a little bit of camp there's really no fat to be found here! The cinematography is excellent and the choreography for action scenes is extremely well done. The film was shot in black and white to highlight the darkness of this mystery thriller.

When the action starts, we meet newlyweds John and Ruth Stanton Bowman (Carl Betz and Jeanne Crain, respectively) who board an ocean liner for a transatlantic crossing on their honeymoon. As the ship pulls out of port in New York City, John mentions to Ruth that he needs to go to the purser to deposit some cash for safekeeping. Trouble is, that's when the mystery begins. Ruth quickly finds out that her husband never keeps his appointment to meet her in the ship's lounge bar--and there's not even a record of him boarding the ship! The cabin stewardess who saw them both as she prepared the cabin politely but strongly denies that she ever saw John; and his passport and clothing are missing from their cabin!

Ruth panics, understandably, and when she is reassigned to another room the captain of the ship starts to suspect that Ruth is crazy and deluded. He wants to confine Ruth to her cabin for the crossing but the much kinder ship's doctor Paul Manning (Michael Rennie) wants to investigate Ruth's story just on the chance that she might not be hallucinating after all.

Nevertheless, Ruth continues to panic and this only makes the captain as well as the other passengers rather uncomfortable. After Ruth makes a big scene in the ship's ballroom even Dr. Manning agrees to let the captain forcibly confine Ruth to her cabin for the remainder of the voyage.

So, now, how will this all be resolved? Ruth does get one very brief phone call from her husband John who warns her that they are being watched--is it true? Where is John--on the ship or on land? Is Ruth waving goodbye to anyone in particular as the ship pulls out of port in New York City? Watch the movie and find out--I'm certainly not about to give out spoilers!

The DVD comes with an interview with Jeanne Crain's granddaughter and that's grand. There are a few other extras but this interview is really the best of them in my opinion.

Dangerous Crossing is a fine mystery thriller that looks quite professional despite the fact that is was produced on a rather low budget and filmed in just nineteen days. I highly recommend this film for persons who like mysteries; and fans of Michael Rennie and the others in the cast will not be disappointed.",1234396800,3,2860,4.6646825396825395

3049305,4,B0010KHOSU,"After a whirlwind romance, a couple set sail on the ""Monrovia"" for their dream honeymoon.  But no bliss ensues. Hubby Carl Betz (the dad on the ""Donna Reed Show""), vanishes after a trip to the Bursar's office. The frantic new bride (Jeanne Crain) is understandably beside herself! An overwrought Crain looks high and low but receives scant assistance from a polite, though skeptical crew. No one saw Betz! JC has no record of any marriage- Betz had all their papers. Viewers know all along that Crain is right but who will believe her?  There are some great noir touches: those gloomy, misty nighttime decks, dark corners, dreary corridors and that moaning foghorn. There is a spooky trip to the baggage room and that creepy old man who keeps turning up. A good review won't give a resolution but just maybe that good girl Crain will land on her feet. Maybe! The bottom line is that ""Dangerous Crossing"" is very well done.  DC is fast moving with no wasted movement. The small screen, black and white format adds to the tension. Ms. Crain is very good in the lead. She was certainly an attractive woman. Michael Rennie shines as the ship's doctor and the one supportive crew member. Honorable mention goes to veteran character actor Willis Bouchey as the ship's skipper. Many may remember his face and distinctive voice. It was he who delivered that wonderful closing line: ""Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance!"" The only negative here is one wonders what a second viewing might produce. Would it reveal a hole in the plot or would it divulge a clue or two as to what Betz was up to?  2 closing questions: When did Hollywood lose the talent for making tight, ""efficient"" films like ""Dangerous Crossing""?

3049308,4,B0010KHOSU,"Here's a perfect example of what the studio system could do with a B-movie. Shot in a mere 19 days, utilizing previously built sets, made on a modest budget, this mystery at sea delivers the goods in far more than just workmanlike fashion.

Newlywed Ruth Bowman (the lovely Jeanne Crain) & her handsome new husband (a young Carl Betz) board ship for a honeymoon cruise after a whirlwind courtship & wedding. It's all too wonderful for Ruth ... until her husband disappears, and there's no evidence of him ever having boarded the ship. In fact, there's considerable doubt as to whether he ever existed at all!

Enter the handsome & caring ship's doctor (an elegant Michael Rennie), the only one on board who seems genuinely sympathetic to her plight. Of course, by this time Ruth's nerves are so rattled that she doesn't quite trust him ... but who else is there to trust? And then there's the matter of those mysterious phone calls --

I won't give away any more. This is a solid thriller, with not a wasted moment, swimming with atmosphere & enough red herrings to keep you guessing (wrongly) until the very end. This might have been just a B-movie, but the filmmakers & cast gave it their all -- and it shows.

Quickly enveloped by a paranoia of everyone, I was mislead to believe my advice shouted to the beautiful heroine, Ruth Stanton Bowman (Jeanne Crain), was correct. Needless to say the plot of a husband that carries his bride across a stateroom threshold and into emotional terror was absorbing - drawing the viewer onboard the vessel as an unworthy confidant.

3283760,5,B0010KHOSU,"Three new film noirs and a weepy double feature---what more could you want for a late winter's evening (or evenings) entertainment? Some of the noirs are weepy, and some of the weepies are noirs, so it gets a little confusing. The one genuine, dyed-in-the-wool noir is 1953's Dangerous Crossing, coming in at a taught 76 minutes. Jeanne Crain plans to spend her honeymoon on a luxury liner with new hubby Carl Betz; problem is, hubby disappears within minutes of boarding, and all the signs point to him never existing. Kindly ship's doctor Michael Rennie straightens it all out, with a goodly number of thrills along the way. Black Widow is less successful a noir, despite the starry cast of Ginger Rogers, Van Heflin, Gene Tierney and George Raft. Set in the celebrity driven world of the New York theatre circa 1954,
an ambitious young author uses her wiles to get ahead to little avail, as someone offs her halfway through the film, it's a whodunit that degenerates into a who cares. The main characters aren't drawn sharply enough, and the plot seems oddly discombobulated. With the exception of Heflin, the stars are somewhat past their prime and seem, unfortunately, a bit seedy However, Daisy Kenyon is the pick of the litter, despite it being squarely a Joan Crawford weepy rather than a noir. A love triangle with Crawford, Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda deftly directed by Otto Preminger, one in a long line of her female leads making her way with pluck and honor in a man's world. It's black and white, it rains a lot, and there are some great atmospheric shots, but a film noir it ain't. There are also vintage scenes of mid-century Provincetown, and former Cape resident Ruth Warrick plays Andrew's beleaguered wife; despite Preminger's earlier great noirs such as Laura and Whirlpool, this really is a weepy.
The weepy double feature from Universal consists of Portrait in Black and Madame X, both starring Lana Turner and produced by that sultan of excess, Ross Hunter. Hunter's reality had little relationship to anyone else's; his was a world of the rich or near rich, beautiful or near beautiful, with lots of jewels and Jean Louis gowns, where there were no small emotions, only large, operatic, over-the-top scenes. Portrait in Black is a noir, albeit a noir in blazing color that his nothing to do with the low, cheap detective thrillers we all know and love. Turner and Anthony Quinn kill off her ailing husband Lloyd Nolan, and somebody knows their dirty little secret. Is it bubbly Sandra Dee, pert John Saxon, crusty Ray Walston or the ever mysterious Anna May Wong? And, as weepy par excellance, little can be said about Madame X, other than a profound and astonished, ""wow!"" Turner, as the poor but honest wife of super rich John Forsythe, is blackmailed by her evil mother-in-law, Constance Bennett, into leaving him and their baby, who, as he grows up to be Keir Dullea, might not be such a bad idea on the face of it. Later, Lana's accused of murder and her lawyer is---you guessed it---Dullea, who has no idea that he's defending his mom. You know, they simply are not making films like this any more. We may all be better off.",1205798400,2,3157,4.762773722627737
3283761,3,B0010KHOSU,"As I write this review, there have been two reviews of this film posted here, each of which gave it five stars.  I enjoyed the movie, but I have to say that five stars is a little over-exuberant for this particular movie.  I would reserve that sort of rating for a Casablanca, The Lady Vanishes, Duck Soup, and quite a few others, but I don't think those who made this movie intended it to be an undying work of cinema art, and so I'm giving it three stars, recognizing it as a solid, workmanlike product churned out by the studio system in (as the special features on the DVD point out several times), just nineteen days of shooting.

Let me be a little more specific.  I'm going to limit what I say to a certain extent, because this is a film based on a story by John Dickson Carr, the master of ""locked room"" mysteries, and a large part of the film's dramatic energy stems from the fact that the story starts out with one of those seemingly impossible situations -- the young, starry-eyed bride boards the ocean liner with her wonderful new husband, only to have him disappear within minutes after boarding, and to have no one else on board the ship acknowledge that he ever existed.  (Similar in some ways to The Lady Vanishes, mentioned above as a five-star effort of this sort by Mr. Hitchcock.)

Anyway, I am honor-bound not to write any spoilers, and I won't.  What I will say is that the film is very well made.  The special features point out that this movie used sets left over from the ""Titanic"" film of that era, so the quality of the shipboard scenes is quite good from a technical point of view.  The acting and direction are fine, and the movie is very short and to the point.  There is a good air of mystery, and we, the viewers, are left wondering what on earth (sea, I should say) is going on until a ""reveal"" moment by a villain about halfway through.  (I hope that wasn't a spoiler, but, yes, there is at least one villain; it wasn't all just a big mistake.)

My main criticism isn't really anything negative -- the movie is well done for what it is.  What it is, in my opinion, is a good example of the films cranked out like sausages back in the days before television caught on.  I'm a bit too young to remember, but I believe the movies changed at least once per week in those days, and there often were double features.  This would not have been a bill-topper.  It strikes me as a woman-oriented melodrama, with a plot and style bearing hallmarks of the mass-produced romance novel -- young woman in grave jeopardy on board a ship; no one is listening to her, except a tall, dark, and handsome doctor (Michael Rennie), who is attentive, suave, and warm. There is not much in the way of subtlety or complexity in the film.  There is an effective build-up of suspense, and some fairly standard ""shocks"" from bumping into things or hearing strange noises, or doors creaking, but nothing that really resonates as having great artistic merit.

Also, although I'm not at liberty to discuss them with those of you who haven't yet seen the film, I saw what I believe to be fairly obvious holes in the plot.  A story like this by definition has to be somewhat contrived, in order to set up the seemingly impossible situation, but, once the solution was revealed, I had to ask myself how that solution would have been possible, practically speaking.  In other words, how could the villain(s) have pulled that off, realistically. The movie does not do a great job of explaining the solution in any detail.

But, I have no regrets at having bought and watched the DVD.  The movie is very nicely transferred to DVD; both audio and video are fine, and the featurette on the making of the film, with Jeanne Crain's grand-daughter and others, was quite informative.  The movie is a good, entertaining diversion for a rainy afternoon, but it rates no more than a solid three stars.",1205625600,29,3890,4.486524822695036

This is what this movie deals with. It is very real and is very well directed. Also an excellent screenplay. Jeanne Crain is so seriously embroidered in a web of her character and plays convincingly. A journey with her through entire movie is also a dress rehearsal of the best kind. She has a beauty that compliments every piece of her attire.
 Michael Rennie is a very real discovery for me. But what a discovery it is!

Yes, there are some ""holes"" in the story but they don't detract from the overall enjoyment of this classic.

Jeanne Crain is one of my fav actresses from that era. So beautiful and such a perfect choice for this part too. The whole cast was well chosen.

To think that this film was made in 19 DAYS and at a cost of less than a million dollars, is amazing too! Something that wouldn't happen now.

The quality of the filming was what really stood out for me. You really did feel like you were on a ship, not watching actors on sets, it was so well done in this regard.

3283783,3,B0010KHOSU,"Out In The 1950s Film Noir Night- Jeanne Crain's Dangerous Crossing

You really should be wary of whirlwind romances, quick romances that end in marriage, and maybe danger. No I am not an old spoilsport, a naysaying in matters of the heart, but unless you know somebody for a while, get a feel for what they are about, get that ""under your skin"" feeling then back off, back off a little. You just never know when some guy or gal might be a gold-digger just looking to get fat and sassy at your expense.

Take the lovely Ruth (played by Jeanne Crain) in the 1950s film noir mystery under review, Dangerous Crossing, she was feeling blue after the sudden death of her rich father and grabbed onto the nearest Johnnie around, took the whirlwind, and then the marriage plunge. If she had taken my advice, or had this John Bowman (played by Carl Betz) guy who swept her off her feet checked out she could have saved herself a lot of angst and anguish. But no she took the plunge, clueless, and then went on a honeymoon cruise that took the starch out of everything.

Now your average ship cruise, until lately anyway, is pretty uneventful, just food, booze and shuffleboard. But from about minute one this turned out to be the cruise from hell and Ruth's life was upended. The loving couple (knowing each other for all of four weeks), Ruth and John, boarded the ship and then John took a powder, went missing. Ruth, a little unstable due to the father's death, was frantic. She looked everywhere, asked everybody about his whereabouts, making a general nuisance of herself in the process. Nobody seemed to believe her story denying that this John was on board.  She was ultimately medical help by one Doctor Manning (played by Michael Rennie) but was looked at by one and all as a looney.

But here is the funny thing this John was on board, had a confederate on board (okay, his real honey, but that's still a confederate isn't it), and had created an elaborate hoax to do away with Ruth and grab her dough. Now you know in these film noir things, particularly 1950s noir, that the main point driven home is that crime does not pay so you know that, elaborate hoax or not, this Johnnie is doomed. Watch the film is find out how. Oh yah, and be careful, very careful the next time you have a whirlwind romance. Enough said.",1382572800,,2318,4.496437054631829

A newlywed couple board an ocean liner and the husband goes off to run an errand, never to be seen again. The wife is presented with evidence and testimony that she is actually unmarried and booked a solo passage. But the husband contacts her secretly with a warning they are both in danger, and the ship's doctor is skeptical of her story but still feels there is something strange in the works. The taut and economical screenplay -- ignoring plot holes -- is skillfully written and expertly performed by a cast of fine actors who include Jean Crain and Michael Rennie as the wife and doctor, Max Showalter as a ship's officer, Willis Bouchey as the Captain, and several others who don't get credited. Oh, and Carl Betz as the husband, and in this case definitely not the husband from the Donna Reed Show. When it's all said and done, it's a bit amazing that so much could be crammed into just an hour and a quarter. So what about those plot holes? They mainly involve the need to keep a conspiracy secret and a ruse convincing, and success depends too much on coincidence and contrivance.

3283792,4,B0010KHOSU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Click on the DVD special features and you'll learn a few interesting things about 'Dangerous Crossing'. First off, it only took 19 days to film; and it cost about $500,000 which was less than half of what Twentieth Century Fox was paying for their 'A' blockbusters such as 'Titanic', which also was released around the same time in 1953. Speaking of 'Titanic', a good number of the sets from that film were used in 'Crossing' along with a pool set from 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes', another 'A' feature, also released in 1953. By using the sets from those other more expensive films, this was a big reason why the producers of 'Dangerous Crossing' were able to have the film made on the cheap as well as shoot it on such a short schedule.

'Dangerous Crossing' is a taut, little mystery with an ocean cruise as its setting. Jeanne Crain plays Ruth Stanton Bowman who just got married a day before and is off on her honeymoon with John Bowman (played by Carl Betz, known for his stint on TV's 'Donna Reed Show' a few years later). Once the couple boards the ship and settles into their cabin, the story takes a real spooky twist, reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode. John disappears and the crew has no record of him being on the passenger manifest. Ruth starts to panic and the ship's captain orders the ship's physician, Paul Manning (played by the erudite Michael Rennie), to basically keep tabs on her. It appears that Ruth is off her rocker but the captain goes by the book and orders a search of the ship with negative results.

The tension in the plot keeps rising as Ruth receives a mysterious call from John who warns her that both of them are in great danger and he'll have to contact her later. The call makes Ruth even more frantic as she basically begins running around the ship conducting her own investigation. At a certain point, Ruth realizes that if she continues to act hysterically and fails to contain her anger, the doctor will be forced by the captain to confine her to her quarters. So she begins pretending that her story about coming on board with her husband, is simply a figment of her imagination (an idea suggested to her by Dr. Manning).

Ruth's paranoia is exacerbated when she encounters various fellow passengers and crew members all who seem quite menacing in her eyes. One passenger in particular sends her into a tailspin and that's this older German gentleman who walks with a limp and carries a cane. Of course he's just there (like most of the other crew and passengers) to throw the audience off the scent.

After Dr. Manning shows Ruth a telegram from the Bureau of Investigation on the mainland that her personal physician and housekeeper know nothing about her getting married, Ruth confesses that she kept the marriage a secret. It seems she had a reason to fear someone might be after her and her new husband: right before her father died, he left her the family business--cutting out the father's half-brother who threatened the father in the event that he planned to disinherit him.

Ruth experiences her 'dark moment the soul' when she encounters John on the deck and he runs away from her. In an excellent scene, she runs into the dining room and in a fit of paranoia, faints after she believes the crew members are all coming after her. The ship's captain immediately confines her to her quarters and her fears of being branded a lunatic have come true. Soon we learn that she hasn't been crazy after all. In the climactic scene, one of the ship's officers (who has been feigning illness and has been on sick leave) turns out to have impersonated Ruth's husband. Since Ruth has been confined to quarters and the ship will dock the next day, 'Bowman' attempts to strangle Ruth and throw her overboard, to make it look like she committed suicide. Manning intercepts Ruth's would-be killer and he ends up getting caught in a rope and falls overboard.

Up until the ending, 'Dangerous Crossing' is a highly entertaining mystery which keeps the audience continually guessing as to the outcome. The outcome however has one main problem. If 'Bowman' had been successful, he couldn't have claimed Ruth's inheritance since it would have shed light on his whole plot to kill her. It appears that 'Bowman' was really working with Ruth's father's half-brother who probably had paid 'Bowman' to do Ruth in. So it would have been much better if 'Bowman' mentioned this to Ruth as he's about to strangle her--he could have said something to the effect, 'Remember that uncle of yours--well, he and I had a little deal. Now, I hope you finally get it.""

Most of the performances in 'Dangerous Crossing' are quite good but I did feel Jeanne Crain could have kept some of those histrionics under wrap. I'm referring especially to all those fainting spells every time she ends up receiving some kind of bad news. Also I found Dr. Manning to be remarkably patient (as well as Captain Peters) in dealing with the oftentimes hysterical Ruth. I know the staff of a cruise ship must be patient and courteous to the passengers, but would crew members today be as patient with someone like Ruth, who had a continual problem in controlling her anger?

'Dangerous Crossing' is a surprisingly well-made 'B' film noir. Particularly impressive is the cinematography in which a multitude of close-ups are utilized to a most efficacious effect.",1292630400,,5403,4.727176220806794

3283794,4,B0010KHOSU,"After watching this wonderful movie today on DVD, I have to say what a great little movie it was. It is in fact a ""hidden"" gem..........I don't remember watching it on TV in my younger days.

Michael Rennie and especially the absolutely attractive Jeanne Crain were magnificent in this lovely Fox film noir gem. I'd go as far as saying Jeanne nearly deserved an Oscar nomination for her role..........she played the part superbly and her acting skills came to the fore here (I don't know how people can question her acting abilities)!! as she completely shone all the way through, and looked so beautiful and sexy too.

The only downside for me was the slightly ""contrived"" ending. I know the story of the movie was originally taken from a novel, but a slightly more adventurous ending  would have given the movie the whole magical 5 stars............but still a very good 4 out of 5.",1274832000,,884,4.7272727272727275

Crain has never been more beautiful or effective than she is here, and Rennie (an underrated actor) is believable in the role of ship's doctor. This one will surprise you with its plot twists.  It's definitely worth adding to any mystery film collection!",1274659200,,511,4.593406593406593
3283796,4,B0010KHOSU,"Gene Tierney might have been the reigning female star of noir at Fox, but Jeanne Crain certainly gives Tierney a run for her money in the sublime ""locked room"" mystery DANGEROUS CROSSING, one of her last major movies before leaving the studio in 1953.

In DANGEROUS CROSSING, Jeanne Crain plays Ruth, the lovely if ever-so-slightly unstable wife of John Bowman (Carl Betz).  Their honeymoon cruise hits a snag when the groom promptly ""disappears"" just as the boat launches.  Frantic Ruth appeals for help from passengers and crew members alike but the story is always the same: they don't recall seeing Ruth with anyone, let alone a husband.  Concerned Dr. Manning (Michael Rennie) takes the shattered woman under his wing; and he's determined to discover the real cause of Ruth's ""delirium"".  But no-one, much less Ruth, will be able to understand the true motives behind the vanished husband.

Economically filmed in only nineteen days using the pre-existing ship sets built for the 1953 Fox production of ""Titanic"", DANGEROUS CROSSING is a testament to the professionalism of Jeanne Crain--who was battling a 'flu during the shoot--that she was able to flesh out such a believable character in a short amount of time, delivering one of her finest performances in the process.  Ruth in DANGEROUS CROSSING is right up there with ""Pinky"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"" and ""A Letter to Three Wives"".

The ""locked room"" mystery movie is a great example of a successful noir sub-genre; other movies with the same theme include Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"", 1932's ""Midnight Warning"", and the underrated masterpiece ""So Long at the Fair"" starring Jean Simmons and Dirk Bogarde (still sadly-unavailable on DVD--hello, Criterion!).  DANGEROUS CROSSING was based on a popular radio play by John Dickson Carr entitled ""Cabin B-13"".

The DVD includes a wonderful new Making Of featurette (""Peril at Sea: Charting a Dangerous Crossing""), audio commentary with Aubrey Solomon, isolated musical score track, interactive galleries and the trailer; plus sneak peeks at similar titles in the Fox Film Noir collection.

Highly recommended.",1257292800,3,2119,5.258160237388724

3283799,5,B0010KHOSU,"Dangerous Crossing is one of the best thriller/mysteries I've seen to date. It was actually filmed in a mere nineteen days although you'd never guess it! Jeanne Crain was highly intelligent and put everyone to the task of keeping up with her; and the result was wonderful. Yes, the ship's foghorn sounds too much during the early half of this film; but it's all atmospheric and despite just a little bit of camp there's really no fat to be found here! The cinematography is excellent and the choreography for action scenes is extremely well done. The film was shot in black and white to highlight the darkness of this mystery thriller.

When the action starts, we meet newlyweds John and Ruth Stanton Bowman (Carl Betz and Jeanne Crain, respectively) who board an ocean liner for a transatlantic crossing on their honeymoon. As the ship pulls out of port in New York City, John mentions to Ruth that he needs to go to the purser to deposit some cash for safekeeping. Trouble is, that's when the mystery begins. Ruth quickly finds out that her husband never keeps his appointment to meet her in the ship's lounge bar--and there's not even a record of him boarding the ship! The cabin stewardess who saw them both as she prepared the cabin politely but strongly denies that she ever saw John; and his passport and clothing are missing from their cabin!

Ruth panics, understandably, and when she is reassigned to another room the captain of the ship starts to suspect that Ruth is crazy and deluded. He wants to confine Ruth to her cabin for the crossing but the much kinder ship's doctor Paul Manning (Michael Rennie) wants to investigate Ruth's story just on the chance that she might not be hallucinating after all.

Nevertheless, Ruth continues to panic and this only makes the captain as well as the other passengers rather uncomfortable. After Ruth makes a big scene in the ship's ballroom even Dr. Manning agrees to let the captain forcibly confine Ruth to her cabin for the remainder of the voyage.

So, now, how will this all be resolved? Ruth does get one very brief phone call from her husband John who warns her that they are being watched--is it true? Where is John--on the ship or on land? Is Ruth waving goodbye to anyone in particular as the ship pulls out of port in New York City? Watch the movie and find out--I'm certainly not about to give out spoilers!

The DVD comes with an interview with Jeanne Crain's granddaughter and that's grand. There are a few other extras but this interview is really the best of them in my opinion.

Dangerous Crossing is a fine mystery thriller that looks quite professional despite the fact that is was produced on a rather low budget and filmed in just nineteen days. I highly recommend this film for persons who like mysteries; and fans of Michael Rennie and the others in the cast will not be disappointed.",1234396800,3,2860,4.6646825396825395

Hubby Carl Betz (the dad on the ""Donna Reed Show""), vanishes after a trip to the Bursar's office. The frantic new bride (Jeanne Crain) is understandably beside herself! An overwrought Crain looks high and low but receives scant assistance from a polite, though skeptical crew. No one saw Betz! JC has no record of any marriage- Betz had all their papers. Viewers know all along that Crain is right but who will believe her?  There are some great noir touches: those gloomy, misty nighttime decks, dark corners, dreary corridors and that moaning foghorn. There is a spooky trip to the baggage room and that creepy old man who keeps turning up. A good review won't give a resolution but just maybe that good girl Crain will land on her feet. Maybe! The bottom line is that ""Dangerous Crossing"" is very well done.  DC is fast moving with no wasted movement. The small screen, black and white format adds to the tension. Ms. Crain is very good in the lead. She was certainly an attractive woman. Michael Rennie shines as the ship's doctor and the one supportive crew member. Honorable mention goes to veteran character actor Willis Bouchey as the ship's skipper. Many may remember his face and distinctive voice. It was he who delivered that wonderful closing line: ""Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance!"" The only negative here is one wonders what a second viewing might produce. Would it reveal a hole in the plot or would it divulge a clue or two as to what Betz was up to?  2 closing questions: When did Hollywood lose the talent for making tight, ""efficient"" films like ""Dangerous Crossing""?

3283805,4,B0010KHOSU,"Here's a perfect example of what the studio system could do with a B-movie. Shot in a mere 19 days, utilizing previously built sets, made on a modest budget, this mystery at sea delivers the goods in far more than just workmanlike fashion.

Newlywed Ruth Bowman (the lovely Jeanne Crain) & her handsome new husband (a young Carl Betz) board ship for a honeymoon cruise after a whirlwind courtship & wedding. It's all too wonderful for Ruth ... until her husband disappears, and there's no evidence of him ever having boarded the ship. In fact, there's considerable doubt as to whether he ever existed at all!

Enter the handsome & caring ship's doctor (an elegant Michael Rennie), the only one on board who seems genuinely sympathetic to her plight. Of course, by this time Ruth's nerves are so rattled that she doesn't quite trust him ... but who else is there to trust? And then there's the matter of those mysterious phone calls --

I won't give away any more. This is a solid thriller, with not a wasted moment, swimming with atmosphere & enough red herrings to keep you guessing (wrongly) until the very end.

3283808,5,B0010KHOSU,"This is an outstanding movie, a little gem.  Filled with suspense and interest.  A newly married woman boards a cruise ship with her husband and he immediately disappears.  The ship's officials think she is delusional. Worth watching.",1212192000,10,234,5.27027027027027

3283810,3,B0010KHOSU,"this is a movie i've waited years to see again.  i totally enjoyed it for that reason.  also there is commentary that i really enjoyed.  i like jeanne crain, so i enjoyed her.  but you can tell that they made this movie really quickly.  the dialogue's not great.  and the performance is a bit overboard in places.  but i still thoroughly enjoyed it and am glad that i was finally able to see it again.",1210636800,2,401,4.266666666666667
3283811,4,B0010KHOSU,"A ship crossing mystery is not a new plot so I didn't expect much. Quickly enveloped by a paranoia of everyone, I was mislead to believe my advice shouted to the beautiful heroine, Ruth Stanton Bowman (Jeanne Crain), was correct. Needless to say the plot of a husband that carries his bride across a stateroom threshold and into emotional terror was absorbing - drawing the viewer onboard the vessel as an unworthy confidant. With Hitchockian style, the seemingly predictable nature of the film was just the opposite, even though significant clues were clearly presented from the very beginning.

Jeanne Crain is an accomplished actress, having starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PINKY/dp/B00066FAOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PINKY</a>&nbsp;(1949),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-LETTER-TO-THREE-WIVES/dp/B00074DY0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A LETTER TO THREE WIVES</a>&nbsp;(1949), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEAVE-HER-TO-HEAVEN/dp/B00074DY0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN</a>&nbsp;(1945). Her talent comes to life when considering that filming of this thriller was completed in just 19 days (as noted on the excellent DVD extra ""Peril at Sea: Charting a Dangerous Crossing""). Bon voyage for surprised boarders of DANGEROUS CROSSING - a precursor to the similarly themed movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FLIGHTPLAN/dp/B000BYY11Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FLIGHTPLAN</a>.

3283812,3,B0010KHOSU,"This is a fun little film that keeps building in suspense until the final payoff.  The cast is competent and attractive and the production is pretty much first-rate.  The mini feature about the making of Dangerous Crossing is interesting, as it explains how movie production in the old studio days was incredibly fast.  To think this movie was filmed in 19 days, with the polished look of an A-picture, even though it was filmed with a B-picture budget.  Sets from Gentleman Prefer Blondes and Titanic were reused making the film seem more prestigious than it really was.  An important film for Jeanne Crain (who looks beautiful) fans, Dangerous Crossing won't disappoint.",1205971200,18,672,5.018018018018018

8237988,2,B0010KHOSU,"Newlywed heiress (Jeanne Crain) and her husband board ship for their honeymoon and he promptly vanishes, along with any evidence he was ever there or even exists, leading everyone to think the wife is either lying or crazy. The promising premise plays out limply, despite some good eerie, fog-laden shots, and the nefarious scheme behind the husband's disappearance isn't exactly ingenious in its conception or execution (and doesn't tie up neatly enough in the end) A serious problem is that even though we know she's telling the truth, as her character is written and acted Crain seems as irritatingly nutty to us as she does to the captain and crew. When someone finally tries to toss her overboard you may wish you could help out with a little push.",1500163200,,753,4.844961240310077

8237990,3,B0010KHOSU,"A bit of a disappointment since this movie came up as a suggestion for Nightmare Alley.  It not very dark and the ending because a bit flat because halfway through the movie they give out suggestions of what is really going on.  If you stop to think about the movie it also seems a little contrived in how things work out.  It an okay movie but, there have been better.  Would suggest you try Scream of Fear, Another Man's Poison, or Too Long at the Fair instead.",1496793600,,463,4.287356321839081

It's nice to see Michael Rennie of the chiseled cheekbones and mellow voice again, and Jeanne Crain certainly is lovely.
