8054328,5,B0007Z0O2C,Bob Brosman is a good artist at playing the Steel. Very good disk to see how Hawaiian music is played.,1395792000,,102,4.15
8054329,5,B0007Z0O2C,Brozman nails it on this video. Shows many essential Hawaiian techniques in an easy to understand and follow lesson. Picks tunes that are representative of the genre and are fairly easy to learn without dumbing anything down. I am 45+ year player and teacher and would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to learn Hawaiian style guitar. Bob is the man!,1363910400,4,364,4.7936507936507935

8054331,5,B0007Z0O2C,Brozeman is a muscian's muscian. By that I mean that he understands what a muscian is seeking in whatever genre of music that applies. In this case it is Hawaiian steel guitar as opposed to steel guitar in general. He has a deep understanding and affection for the music. He gets it. And he knows how to express it and teach it. Well worth the money.,1256688000,7,350,4.318181818181818
8054332,5,B0007Z0O2C,"If you are trying to learn Hawaiian steel guitar, this is the place to start. I've read 4 books and have two book/cd courses, but this Bob Brozman DVD is the best. Starting with a history of the steel, where I was amazed to learn some brand new things, he gives you the building blocks that I was yearning for - how to hold the steel, left hand position, how and when to pick and slide, how to tremelo, etc. Then he starts teaching you scales and harmony's in a way that finally makes it clear to me how the fretboard is put together, after 40 years of never understanding music theory but playing a mean rhythm guitar, I finally get it from him. I'm not into the songs yet, but once you get through course I'll be able to play anything and sound decent. It's an amazing experience!",1182902400,13,782,4.25503355704698
