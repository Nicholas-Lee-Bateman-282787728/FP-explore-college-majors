8300852,3,B000065UGL,"This video is good for those interested in historic moments and the coronation of British monarchs. It shows many parts of the Coronation which were not included in the video ""A Queen Is Crowned"" so it fills in the missing gaps. It was taken from the original BBC coverage of the Coronation and has insightful narration. It shows strictly the Coronation ceremony; no parade footage, golden State Coach or Buckingham Palace balcony scenes.

The downside is that, unlike ""A Queen Is Crowned"", this footage is a mix of color and black and white and has not been remastered so the quality is a bit grainy and there are one or two blank spots. But for the purists, you will see it exactly the way that TV viewers in 1953 saw it. It is probably best viewed on a medium size TV since large screen TV's only magnify the flaws.",1196121600,,818,4.489932885906041
