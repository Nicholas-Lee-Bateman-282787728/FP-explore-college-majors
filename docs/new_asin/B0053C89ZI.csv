8455089,4,B0053C89ZI,"The last, remaining bridge over the Rhinethe Germans want to blow it up to prevent the Allies from using it to easily cross into Germany, even though they will strand many German soldiers on the wrong side of the bridge. The Allies want to save the bridge for easy crossing into Germany. Most war movies include scenes that do not advance the plot, and even though this includes such scenes (the captured French girl in the farm house with gratuitous semi-nudity, idle soldier chatter, etc.), there are a minimum os such scenes in this film. Theres a lot of action, and a lot of five-star explosions. This is a well-done war film and well worth watching.",1504742400,,654,4.646551724137931
