3904123,4,B002C6VMK2,"This was a very strong ppv effort from WWE.  Most of the matches were very good including an excellent main event with a good aftermath that sent the fans home happy.  Yes, I'm talking about the return of the Undertaker.  For a show that was hyped up extremely poorly by WWE, it definately delivered far better than expected.  The wwe title match was bizarre, but I give them credit for trying something different.  This is a dvd that I definately recommend adding tom your collection, it's worth the price.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. Intercontinental Title Match
Rey Mysterio (c) vs. Dolph Ziggler

This was actually a hell of an opening match.  Crowd was very into it by the end, and they had lots of near falls.  Ziggler even had some very audible chants from the crowd in his favor.  Rey wins by reversing a gutbuster off the top rope into a huracanrana, but the match was so well worked that this loss didn't hurt Ziggler.  ***3/4

2. MVP vs. Jack Swagger

Decent match, but it was too short to really get going.  They cut a promo before the match billing this as the spoiled jock vs. the ex-con tough guy.  Somewhat of a surprising finish having MVP go over, but in the end it doesn't really matter.  This came off like filler on TV.  **

3. WWE Tag Team Championship Match
Chris Jericho & Big Show (c) vs. Cryme Tyme

Pretty good match.  It took a little bit to get going but people started to get into it by the end.  The finish came a little abruptly for my taste, and it really didn't do much to elevate Cryme Tyme, but there wasn't a whole lot to complaign about. Worth a look.  **1/2

4. Kane vs. The Great Khali

This was foul.  A poor, poor match to say the least, which is exactly what most sane individuals were expecting.  It wasn't Sharmell vs. Jenna from TNA Victory Road, but there was absolutely nothing of merit in this match.  It wasn't even good filler.  -*

5. Shawn Michaels & Triple H vs. Cody Rhodes & Ted Dibiase

Very good, long match.  Crowd was very into DX.  DX got the win in the end, but they did a good job of elevating Legacy and making them look like credible oponents.  Plus, it's always great to see HBK in the ring again.  All around I thought this was a definate thumbs up, and everyone worked hard.  ***1/2

6. ECW Championship
Christian (c) vs. William Regal

Match lasted less than 10 seconds.  The bell rang, Regal turned around to take his robe off, and Christian hit the Killswitch for the three.  After the match, Zeke Jackson and Kozlov beat down Christian.  They were probably short on time, but couldn't they have cut Kane and Khali instead of gypping the fans on what could have been a pretty good match?  Nothing to see here.  (NR)

7. WWE Championship
Randy Orton (c) vs. John Cena

This was a strange one to say the least.  Match was good until the finish, when Orton shoved the ref and intentionally got DQ'd.  Lillian Garcia, in an epic moment, said the winner and new WWE champion is Randy Orton.  Then she said Vince McMahon ordered the match to restart, under a new set of rules claiming Orton would lose the belt if DQ'd again.  Orton quickly got himself counted out and again the match was ordered to restart, this time stating that if Orton was DQ'd or counted out the belt would change hands.  Orton then pinned cena using the ropes, and another ref came down and got the match restarted again.  Cena finally got the upper hand and had Orton in the STF, and right when it seemed Randy would tap a ""fan"" ran in the ring and broke it up.  Once the confusion died down, Orton hit the RKO for the pin.  Basically, Cena looked like a fool 4 times.  Anyway, I give them credit for trying something different, because they've fueded so much in the past, but this was one of those finishes that you either liked or hated.  ***

8. World Heavyweight Championship TLC Match
Jeff Hardy (c) vs. CM Punk

Tremendous main event.  They didn't have quite as many spots as you might expect, but their timing was superb and everything they did looked good.  The last spot in particular, which I won't spoil but involved a big ladder and an announce table, was phenominal.  Punk gets the clean win and the title in a great match. After the bout, Undertaker returned to a huge pop and chokeslammed CM Punk, so at least the crowd got a happy ending.  ****1/4

This was a very enjoyable ppv.  The wrestling was of a very good quality overall, and I don't think anyone who sees this show would feel slighted of their money's worth.  It's worth having in your collection and would be nice to go back and watch from time to time, and it seems like it's been a while since I said that about a WWE ppv.",1250985600,6,4660,4.3703271028037385
3904124,4,B002C6VMK2,"""SummerSlam 2009"" is another PPV in which the WWE doesn't meet is full potential (in my opinion), but still does a solid enough job of keeping me a fan.  Plus, I think most viewers are less picky than me.

So, with that in mind, here's what I took from the WWE's 22nd ""SummerSlam"":

1) Intercontinental Championship
Rey Mysterio (champion) v. Dolph Ziggler
---What better way to start a Los Angeles event than with a California native and someone from the ""other"" Hollywood duking it out for some gold?  I haven't seen the ""Night of Champions"" encounter, but now I'm curious.  Ziggler (aside from a silly name) has proven in a short period of time that he's someone to pay attention to.  And is there a better PPV performer this year than Mysterio?  This opener starts a little basic, but like most of Mysterio's classics this year, they evolve and progress into seesaw battles that I love most about pro wrestling.  So many near-falls, so many interesting counters, and such a rabid crowd really get your juices flowing.  I've read the ""Night of Champions outing was a disappointment; trust me, this one is a keeper.
""7.5 / 10""
___________________________________________

2) Jack Swagger v. MVP
---After a killer back-and-forth promo, two of RAW's top midcarders come out to make a name for themselves.  Sadly, I didn't get into this one too much.  The crowd didn't react much, either.  It wasn't just because of the passable contest; I think the crowd was literally 50/50, and didn't know who to cheer for.  I have such admiration for both guys, that I didn't want to see either man lose.  This wouldn't have been a problem if the match was a kicking back-and-forth display that made Swagger & MVP look like a million bucks.  Instead, we got something that was best left for TV, and hasn't solved anything.  Not a bad match, but nothing special either.
""6.0 / 10""
___________________________________________

3) Unified Tag Team Championships
Chris Jericho & Big Show (champions) v. Cryme Tyme
---That does it!  I have had it up to here with Cryme Tyme!  This was a perfect chance for JTG & Shad to prove that they could ignite some spark in the tag team division, and instead it was the same kinda of performance we've seen them do for the past three years.  It's sad when Jericho & Big Show (what a stupid combo) are the highlights.  Even the masterful performer that is Y2J couldn't get much going out of this.  This was your standard tag contest in which we wait forever for the hot tag, and even when our healthy hero storms the ring, he still fails.  I admit, the finish was a nice touch (JTG fought valiantly to reach the ropes before tapping out, only to receive a knockout fist to the face).  But other than that, it's time for WWE to get this division back on track, and for Cryme Tyme to move out of the way for more talented duos.
""5.5 / 10""
___________________________________________

4) Kane v. The Great Khali
---Okay, I know I gave ""SummerSlam 2009"" a 4-star score.  Just bear with me, we're almost out of the woods.  We just have to endure a silly, clumsy display that makes the ""WrestleMania 23"" showdown look classic.  Even my Dad, the most forgiving of all TV & movie viewers, was questioning the poor choreography.  Bottom line, this was short, and it sucked.
""3.0 / 10""
___________________________________________

5) D-Generation X (Triple H & Shawn Michaels)
v. Legacy (Cody Rhodes & Ted DiBiase)
---So...are you ready?  You better be, because this isn't the comedic kind of DX you're used to.  No silly shenanigans from 2006.  Nope, DX make a grand entrance filled with military weaponry, costuming, & explosions...symbolizing that they're going to fight.  When Triple H starts off against Rhodes & DiBiase start off, I was getting worried because HHH was embarassing Legacy the way I feared.  But once HBK entered the match, Legacy and DX began to create a compelling match filled with unique strategy and exhausting excitement.  We're reminded of HBK's ring rust because he hadn't wrestled since ""WrestleMania"".  We're reminded of how Legacy use the tactics that Randy Orton would've used if he were competing.  We're frustrated that Rhodes & DiBiase are cheating so frequently, but we admire how much they get away with it against the two veterans.  There's so much to describe here, but here's the most important part: It's a fun & exciting PPV-quality knockout.  Legacy have finally gotten a marquee push, and DX has entertained the loyal millions.
""8.0 / 10""
___________________________________________

6) ECW Championship
Christian (champion) v. William Regal
---The only nice thing I can say about this 5-second ripoff was that at least few people seemed to be looking forward to this.  Sadly, I was one of those few.  Why does WWE sucker Christian or Regal's fans if all they're gonna do is disappoint them.  At least ""RAW"" & ""SmackDown"" can have more airtime for their main events.
""No Score"" (""Zero"" if you're hoping for the match I was hoping for)
___________________________________________

7) WWE Championship
John Cena vs. Randy Orton (champion)
---I got a lot to say about this one, so I'll try to keep this simple.  First off, I 'HATE' Cena/Orton singles matches, especially the ""SummerSlam 2007"" main event these two put on.  The reason I'm more accepting of this one is because although the first half is filled that slow methodical Orton pace that may tick off some people, this time Orton & Cena (and WWE) fixed a lot of things.  For one, the crowd is more into the match, because the characters are more charismatic.  Secondly, Orton was known for faster-paced performances years ago, whereas now we expect the patient Viper strikes.  But the best part of this match is that after the predictable first half, the second half of the contest is more creative, and filled with plenty of close calls.  The finish (or finish-es) is absolute madness.  On several occasions, Orton is prevented from cheating his way out of the match, and yet still prevails in another cowardly way.  I don't forgive the previous letdowns that Cena & Orton delivered in the past, but they've got me hoping for another round of action.  Bring It On!
""7.0 / 10""
___________________________________________

8) TLC Match - World Heavyweight Championship
CM Punk v. Jeff Hardy (champion)
---Let me first say that anybody willing to go through a TLC Match has more guts & toughness that I'll ever possess, so I want to commend Punk & Jeff for putting their bodies through some serious pain.  But as a longtime fan, I believe that this TLC Match is a very good main event, but not the classic we've seen in past matches.  Then again, Punk & Jeff are more interested in telling a story than trying to come up with crazy spots, so perhaps I need a wakeup call.  In any event, this another strong entry in the Jeff/Punk rivalry, which appears to now be over.  Both men get to punish each other for our sick delight, and aside from maybe not going for the belt enough, I can't complain too much.  CM Punk is an incredible bad guy and Jeff Hardy has finally sold my critical arse being championship material.  WWE has had a tough time catering to the PG-audience 'AND' the hardcore fanatics.  This time, they've done it.  Oh, and the return of the Undertaker...I can't wait to see this rivalry unfold!
""7.5 / 10""

""SummerSlam 2009"" is not perfect, and has some serious flaws.  But it delivers on the four matches that most people wanted to see.  I'm someone who wants the entire PPV to be a success, but if you're gonna succeed at only some of it, better make it the marquees, right?

3904126,2,B002C6VMK2,"WWE's next two ""Tagged Classics"" sets are this one, and the ""Bash/Vengance 2004"" combo.  Both of them have one thing in common: Each PPV has a must-see classic, while the rest is a total letdown.

*****SUMMERSLAM 2004*****
Because of the tragic Benoit family murder-suicide from July 2007, WWE has played revisionist history with some of their content.  Nancy ""Woman"" Benoit hasn't been edited out of much, but Chris Benoit has been removed from just about everything in the WWE database.

I disagree, but understand the decision.  However, there are a select few matches with Chris Benoit that should NEVER be erased.  The ""SummerSlam 2004"" main event is one of them.  Randy Orton became the youngest champion in WWE history in an extraordinary contest.  Benoit and Orton worked so well together, it's a shame we never got to see a rematch.  Their battle didn't have a lot of time to build up on TV (there's no pre-match video package).  But they couldn't have done a better job in ending the show on a strong note, with a kicking physical battle and a heart-warming aftemath.

It's too bad the rest of the card didn't live up to its potential.

Wanna see Booker T and John Cena begin a Best-of-Five Series for the United States Title?  I did too, but it was a basic match where Cena got beaten for most of the match, and won out of nowhere.

Wanna see Rey Mysterio, Paul London, and Billy Kidman bring their Crusierweight talents to face The Dudleyz?  I did too, but it was decent yet forgettable opener.

Wanna see Matt Hardy and Kane battle for Lita's hand in marriage?  You know, this was stupid in 2004, and in 2005 it became a sad bit of irony considering how Matt & Lita ended up.  Kane has always been a formidable talent, but he's been stuck with some wacky angles.

Wanna see Undertaker and JBL compete for the WWE Championship?  I did too, and I was enjoying myself somewhat.  But Toronto, the ""Bizarro Land"" was so bored they began a Mexican Wave to pass the time by.  Also, even if you liked the match, the post-match beatdown ends with a phony chokeslam.  Trust me, it's embarassing.

Wanna see Diva Dodgeball?  Umm...at least it didn't look scripted...

Wanna see Batista, Edge, and Chris Jericho fight for the IC Title?  This is the most surprising disappointment on the card.  How in the world did these guys get stuck with a 10-minute contest with almost no 3-way action?  Even if you can forgive that problem, nothing creative really came out of this throwaway.

Wanna see if Eugene can forget how much he admired Triple H, and can bring himself to defeat ""The Game""?  I kinda liked this one, but understand that most might not care.  It is my favorite match of Eugene's, if that makes any difference.

The only bit of relief is seeing Kurt Angle return to the ring against Eddie Guerrero.  This mid-card contest wasn't quite as good as their ""WrestleMania XX"" match, mainly because Angle is so dominant that Guerrero looks weaker than usual.  But don't let that worry you; these two legends still put on a crisp, engaging fight.

The difference between a ""disappointment"" and ""garbage"" is that disappoinments had the potential to be something special, while garbage is dismissed before you even glance at it.
""SummerSlam 2004"" is a major disappointment overall.  All of its matches could've been strong showcases for the WWE roster.  Sadly, only the main event and Angle/Guerrero delivered.

*****UNFORGIVEN 2004*****
Answer these two questions before we continue this review:
--- Do you own the WWE's 3-disc ""Ladder Match"" set?
--- Do you have access to YouTube?

If you answered ""Yes"" to both of those questions, then don't even take another look at one of 2004's worst PPVs.

You see, there is a fantastic Ladder Match between Chris Jericho and Christian that WWE graciously included on its excellent ""Ladder Match"" set.  Also, many YouTube users have graciously uploaded the main event between Triple H and Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship, which is quite good.

If you want to see a great Ladder Match, or want to witness the first chapter of Orton's split from Evolution, then you don't need this DVD.

Should you choose to watch this 3-hour broadcast, you will be subjected to plenty of crap-tastic WWE product.

There are a couple of decent matches.  The opener pitting Batista & Ric Flair against Chris Benoit & William Regal is solid, even though too much time is spent on Regal getting beaten down.  Also, Shawn Michaels made an in-ring return against Kane in a No-DQ Match.  HBK is among pro wrestling's absolute best, but this isn't one of his best matches.  It's watchable, but unsatisfying.

So, what did I omit?
Trish Stratus defended the Women's Title against Victoria; these two Divas were capable of great things, but on this night, they bombed.

La Resistance defended the World Tag Team Titles against --- get this --- Tajiri & Rhyno.  Trust me, it sucks.

Oh, the worst PPV match from 2004 is also on here...Tyson Tomko exposes a ""mystery woman"" troublemaker to be....STEVEN RICHARDS!
Oh dear God, does this match suck!  It goes on and on and on, Tomko just punches the living tar out of Richards, and WWE didn't have the good grace to make this a squash.

So, there you have it.  Remember, YouTube and ""Ladder Match"" DVD are all you need to enjoy ""Unforgiven 2004"".

SUMMERSLAM 2009

1.[I-C TITLE]REY MYSTERIO VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-excellent opening match right here, very well done on both parts. This match has everything an opener should have with basic and classic wrestling as well has the high risk stuff. You also get some great high impact moves as well leading to some very close near falls. Rey is always great but Dolph really impressed here with his performance. I also love the ending here with Rey reversing Ziggler and nailing the huricarana, he keeps the title. Great opener for this Summerslam and would even call it a classic.

2. MVP VS JACK SWAGGER-this match ended up being a little short but good, far from best match on the card. The action is high impact and brawl based which is fine for this short match. Over all a good match but not either ones best, M.V.P. hits the Playmaker and gets the win.

3.[TAG TITLE]CHRIS JERICHO & BIG SHOW VS CRYME TYME-do you remember when tag matches would steal the show back in the day. It has been a while since the WWE has had a great tag division. This match does not suck if that is what you are thinking but it is far from stealing the show. Cryme Tyme never really made a huge impact like they could have and Chris and Show were actually the best tag team at the time. This was a good match that got better as it went and had a classic ending. Well at least the ending felt that way to me, Show and Y2J keep the belts after a huge knockout blow.

4. KANE VS GREAT KHALI-now a lot of people hate on this match and I can see why but what did you expect. This was a battle of two monsters and one of which does not move to quickly. So of course the match is a bit slow with brawler like moves but Kane pulls out the win quick enough.

5. DX VS LEGACY-the match I was waiting for when this event happened as my boy HBK was returning. Of course you all know by now that DX entered on the tank and such for the DX army. The match its self is great and really helped put Legacy over even in their loosing effort. There is a lot of great wrestling going on in this match as well as some brawling. DX of course takes the win as the crowd was crazy for them the whole night.

6.[ECW TITLE]CHRISTIAN VS WILLIAM REGAL-this has got to be the quickest match ever. The bell rings and then Christian wins but of course he gets jumped afterwards by Regal's boys. Quick and sweet victory for the peeps, well that is at least until Christian takes that beat down.

7.[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS JOHN CENA-this match right here is one of those ones that most people either love or hate. I personally really like this match and all the multiple finishes and how they did it. To me this was a very creative way to give these two a new match. The action starts slow and builds from there especially once the finishes start. I will say that Orton keeps the belt but watch the ways he tries to keep it.

8.[WORLD TITLE TLC MATCH]JEFF HARDY VS CM PUNK-now I have never been a Jeff Hardy fan even when he first debuted. On the other side I have always been a fan of CM Punk even in his Indy days. With that said even though I don't like Jeff I will not deny his talent. Going into this I knew it would be a good match mainly because I like Punk so much. The action is great here but with few high spots involving all the weapons, which is great because they had a great showing with out all that stuff. Jeff of course goes for his Swanton off of the ladder which was a big moment. Still for me the best was the ending when Punk won the title, I loved it. Then of course the return of the Dead man made the place go crazy.

This was a good Summerslam event that had some really good matches attached to it. Of course there were some matches that were a bit lacking but over all a good event. I say pick it up especially if you are a collector. If not it still had some great matches on it you may enjoy.",1312416000,,3871,4.150666666666667

The Kane-Great Khali match was crud and the good thing about that match was the finish.

3904144,4,B002C6VMK2,"Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Dolph Ziggler - Anyone who saw their match at Night Of Champions knows that Dolph had an impressive performance & this was no different as Dolph grounded Mysterio & focused on his neck making moves like a lariat he gave more high impact.  Mysterio as usual did use his high flyin' moves like doing this standing moonsault from the top turnbuckle off of countering a backdrop in the opening moments while also getting caught by Ziggler with a dropkick in midair.  Great opener & another impressive performance from Dolph.

M.V.P. vs. Jack Swagger - The storyline, even down the prematch promo, between these two was very well done.  However, the match itself was really just average between the two that didn't follow the previous match leaving the crowd very dead for the most part.  The match wasn't bad or came off as a filler but it was just placed in the wrong spot IMO.

Unified Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Big Show vs. Cryme Tyme - This was a better match than I expected as eventhough I find Cryme Tyme's antics entertaining, I don't care for their matches.  This was the best performance from Show & Jericho as a tag up to this date while Cryme Tyme held their own here.  There wasn't anything that good out but it was a good above average performance.

Kane vs. Great Khali - I was at this event live just knew based off how bad WrestleMania 23 was that this was the time to take a break to get something to eat & boy was a right when I saw the replay as this match was bad & unless they really needed a buyrate from Khali's home country, there was no reason for this match to be on here.

D-Generation X vs. Legacy - Damn, DX sure knew how to make an entrance to introduce their latest run as a team under ""The DX Army"" & also marks the in-return of Shawn Michaels since WrestleMania. This tag match was completely different than the previous one as this was a very strong match from start to finish as Legacy not only held their own here against DX but delivered a real breakout performance as this match had nice wresting, a good brawl on the outside, and enough time to materialize into something special as the crowd was hot from start to finish.  This is one of those matches where eventhough Dibiase & Rhodes lost, they left with more credibility than they did coming into it.

ECW Champion Christian vs. William Regal - For the second year in a row, the ECW title match results in a ""don't blink or you'll miss it"" match.  This was more about what happened afterwards but a complete waste of time...they made up for this at Breaking Point.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena - How ironic is it that the first time they met for the WWE Championship was two years earlier at this same event & to this point, that was the best one on one match they had against each other.  The started of good on the mat before Cena turned it up quickly with his offense while Orton did his ""Viper"" like offense by being so cold & calculating.  The crowd was heavily for Orton & against cena even down to where it was so obivious during a dueling punch showoff between the two.  In the end, Orton's ""champions"" advantage kept backfiring on him while an incident happened that shocked everyone there (to the point where TNA did the same thing two months later) leaving the door for this feud to continue.  I guess SummerSlam has a positive effect when it comes to these two as SummerSlam has delivered the best matches between these two up to this point.

TLC Match: World Champion Jeff Hardy vs. C.M. Punk - This match was very similar to how Edge & Jeff Hardy had their ladder match months earlier in that this wasn't a non-stop spotfest more than a match where they used the weapons to make moves more high impact & trying to tell a story.  It's a TLC match so all elements were used as expected along with various moments such as Punk slamming Hardy onto an open chair to the backrest hit his spine, Hardy missing a splash & crashing through a table on the outside, Hardy reversing Punk's running knee kick/bulldog combination into a toss to the outside table, and of course Jeff Hardy being the human highlight reel with the swanton bomb that you have to see to believe...and I still didn't believe I saw it when I was there.  This was a great one on one TLC match from both men while what happened to end the show was probably just as shocking as we saw another WWE return & great way to end the show.

I was at this show live & with WWE put in heavy effort to try to put SummerSlam over as their second biggest PPV of the year behind WrestleMania with all the celebrities in attendance along with their weekend activies & weekend long Fan Axxess (which I was at & won a year subscription to WWE magazine...which I stil haven't recieved), the quality they produced here was definately the best they've done in years eventhough there was some low points (Kane/Khali & two years in a row ECW gets a ""don't blink"" match?) so this is a show worth checking out.",1262390400,,5014,4.415401301518438

IC Title
Rey Mysterio vs Dolph Ziggler
This match was so much better than I anticipated.  Crowd was super hot for this match also.  Ziggler and Mysterio traded a flurry of back of forth offense during the whole match.  It has me genuinely guessing as to who would win in the end.  8/10

MVP vs Jack Swagger
The crowd seemed a little sucked dry after that first match, they were not feeling this one too much.  MVP and Swagger seemed to have trouble meshing here at times.  They pulled it together the last couple of minutes for an okay ending though.  5/10

Tag Titles
Chris Jericho & Big Show vs Cryme Tyme
This was another okay match.  There is not much here I couldn't expect to see on a pretty decent edition of RAW.  It was kept to a good length.  5/10

Kane vs Great Khali
It is exactly like you think it would be.  Exactly.  3/10

DX vs Legacy
BOOM!  Loved this match from top to bottom!  Crowdy was hot for it, even more so as it went on.  It reminded me alot of the great 20 minute old school tag matches from the 80's.  It also still maintained a big time-blockbuster tag match feel to it.  Great tag team psychology and story telling here.  I could watch this one over and over.  My roomates - who are casual wrestling fans- were going nuts during this one.  They loved it.  It's hard to get them to stay tuned to a 20 minute match also.  9.5/10

ECW Title
Christian vs Regal
5 seconds long.  Not going to rate this one.

WWE Championship
Randy Orton vs John Cena
The extremely slow pace to begin with semi-lost me, at least in the beginning.  The strangeness of the events that kept happenning though actually got me more into it.  I ended up really enjoying this match.  I felt like it was creative and gave steam to keep the feud going.  I like the route the WWE used here - although I know alot of people didnt.  7/10

World Heavyweight Championship
Ladder Match
CM Punk vs Jeff Hardy
I'll be honest here, when they first announced this match I was pumped.  When I read reviews of this match I was pumped.  When I finally got the DVD and watched this match......I was disapointed.  Don't get me wrong here, it was a solid match, but it just wasn't the awesome match I was expecting.  There's not a whole lot of story telling/psychology here.  There's really two great spots in the match.  The post-match was great and not expected at all though.  I had trouble rating this one.  7/10

Final thought.  If for nothing else, buy it for the great DX vs Legacy match.  You'll also get a surprise gem with Dolph vs Mysterio.  Watch CM vs Hardy if you like a good spot.  Orton vs Cena is good if you enjoy the more fun aspect of wrestling with a little creativity.",1259107200,,2794,4.309477756286267

3904147,4,B002C6VMK2,"This summerslam was average and had some good matches. Thanks for reading and please rate.

M.V.P vs. Jack Swagger
These two had a okay or just average match. realy, they didn't build this rivalry up to be ppv material. I just thought that this match should have been on raw. But that was a impressive win for mvp over the dork people call jack swagger.
match rating:2/5

Kane vs. The Great Khali
As i predicted before this ppv, i said to j-man that this match would stink. I was right. this match was slow and had barely any action in this. I think this match shouldn't have been on summerslam at all.
match rating:0/5

ECW Championship-Christain(c) vs. William Regal
this match stunk as well for being only 8 seconds long. Christian playing some randy orton and sneaking up on regal and hitting the kill switch for the win.
match rating:2/5

Intercontinental Championship-Rey mysterio(c) vs. Dolph ""mr.ziggles"" Ziggler
This match wasn't as good as their night of champions match, but this match was still good. Ziggler pulled off some good moves and dominated for a while on mysterio. At the end, dolph went for a suplex, missed, and got the super hero splash from mysterio for the win.
match rating:4/5

Unified tag team championships-Chris Jericho and Big Show(c) vs. Cryme Tyme
This match was okay. I didn't like that y2j and slow won the match and retained the titles. I realy didn't think that cryme tyme would beat y2j and show because shao and jericho have been in the buisness longer, they have had more experience, and have won more titles, and are just more dominante than cryme tyme.
match rating:3.5/5

WWE Championship-Randy Orton(C) vs. John Cena
This match was just plain out weird. The match had probably been restarted like 3 times. The match was almost like their summerslam 07 match, realy good, until that crazy fan(a.k.a Ted DiBiases brother) attacked the ref. Once order had been restored in the match orton became the viper again and got the rko and got the win over cena to retain the wwe title. Nice counters by cena in this match by countering the rko and punt a couple of times.
match rating:4.5/5

DX vs. Legacy
This match was great. This match was 20 minuets of awesome. This match had everything. Counters, suplex's, brawls, and finishers. This match was all over the place. Great entrance with dx and their remake of the classic wcw invasion. Im happy that the returning dx and shawn michaels pulled off the win. This match went back and fourth with legacy dominating in the beginning. The match got good at the end when triple h and ted dibiase went over the anounce table and just moments later, ""SLAP!!!"" a sweet chin music by shawn michaels for the win. Suck it legacy.
match rating:4.5/5

Tables, Ladders, Chairs/World Heavyweight championship-Jeff Hardy vs. CM Punk
This match was great. The build up for this match was great. Jeff hardy and punk started off with some shots and then some chair shots. Then, when hardy and punk went outside of the ring, Jeff put punk on a table and missed a huge cross body. 3 times a table was used in this match. Once this match got started with the ladders. Hardy got suplexed about 2 times on a ladder. Then when hardy got back up, punk went for his kick/bulldog move. He got the kick, but not the bulldog which hardy countered and put punk through a table. Which led to the swanton off a 20 foot ladder and through the anounce table. Which led to punk throwing some hard punches which led to hardy falling and to punk winning. Then moments after, taker returned and surprised punk with a chokeslam.

3904148,3,B002C6VMK2,"WWE Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio Vs. Dolph Ziggler - This match is almost an exact replica of Mysterio's & Ziggler's clash at Night Of Champions only the difference this time is that the match went at a faster pace, Dolph Ziggler wrestled a more steady match in contrast to before, & the fans were much more into the match as well in oppose to last month at Night Of Champions. A strong showing from both competitors to point where the fans were starting up ""LET'S GO ZIGGLER"" chants. This was a fantastic opening contest & a great match to display the prestige of the I-C Championship. 4/5

M.V.P. Vs. Jack Swagger - Like everyone else, I felt this match had potential but partially fail to capitalize on it. A couple of nice spots in the match but nothing special or past average. A good match if was on RAW but only decent here at SummerSlam. 3/5

Unified Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & The Big Show Vs. Cryme Tyme - It took a little while but I think this Tag Team Title Match turned into something good & worth viewing. The crowd got into the match as it progressed & the ending was a nice finish to the match. Not a whole bunch to complain about as I think all four men put in a good effort & tried their best to put on a good tag team title match. 3.25/5

Kane Vs. The Great Khali - I don't know if it's just me in this category or what but I actually felt this was an improvement to their godawful WrestleMania 23 battle. I think the Great Khali did his best in trying to ""wrestle"" and Kane did everything he could but there just isn't much anyone could do to have a seemingly good match with Khali. In my opinion, this match is an improvement to their WM 23 encounter but is still a pretty poor match. 1.75/5

DX Vs. Legacy - This was a great comeback match for DX & this was a huge step forward for Cody Rhodes & Ted DiBiase as they delivered probably their best match thus far in their short careers. DX's entrance symbalized that DX were about to go to war & thats exactly what this match was. The two youngsters, DiBiase & Rhodes, did one amazing job holding their own against the two future Hall Of Famers in Triple H & Shawn Michaels. Do not expect the comedic performance we got from DX in 2006 against the Spirit Squad & the McMahons as DX gave a lot of credibility to DiBiase & Rhodes. This tag team match had solid in-ring work and DX along with Rhodes & DiBiase gave a strong peformance & argubably put on the best tag team match for the WWE in a very long time. Great match and possibably the match of the night. 4.5/5

ECW Champion Christian Vs. William Regal - For the second year in a row, we get a squash ECW Title match. As soon as the bell rings, Christian hits the Kill Switch on Regal and gets the win. Afterwards, Christian gets maulled by Regal's court, Vladimir Kozlov & Ezkiel Jackson. Christian & Regal definitely deserved better then this.

WWE Champion Randy Orton Vs. John Cena - I'll go on record & say if you can get passed all of the chaos & madness this match had in the end, this is argubably the best one-on-one Cena/Orton match. Randy Orton was playing his ""Viper"" character fantastically to the bone with John Cena stepping up his game & gave us his best performance since his Backlash match against Edge earlier in the year. All the way until the craziness & false finishes began, this match was turning into a great WWE Title Match as Orton & Cena both were putting on a very good back & forth contest. I think the false finishes at the end was a nice touch as it added more unpredictibility to the match. In the end however, Orton gets the true finish & the win to the fan's delight. 4/5

World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Hardy Vs. C.M. Punk (Tables, Ladders, & Chairs Match) - I applaud Hardy & C.M. Punk going out there and putting their bodies on the line but at the same time I didn't see this match reaching the bar like past TLC matches has proceeded to do (especially the Tag Team versions). But like twice before and for a third time here, Hardy & Punk delivered an outstanding World Title Match nevertheless. I give credit to Hardy & Punk also for going out there and telling a great story instead of going out there and being spot monkies for each other. This TLC match was phenomenal for what it was and it did not disappoint whatsoever as it has holds a couple of breath taking spots of it's own. In the end though where one great rivalry ended, another one began in the return of the Undertaker. Great match all the way & one of the best of the night. 4.5/5

Over the years, SummerSlam has lost some it's ""heat"" but this SummerSlam event is an quite enjoyable one. With a few bad booking decisions, I still recommend this event. The DX/Legacy & Punk/Hardy are definitely the matches of the night with the Orton/Cena & Mysterio/Ziggler matches delivering as well. Overall, I felt this was a nice SummerSlam event & is something I recommend checking out.",1253577600,2,4926,4.352557127312296
3904149,4,B002C6VMK2,"Thanks to WWE Classics On Demand, I was able to watch this year's SummerSlam card which when it came to production value, it really got you into noticing that this was going to be a special night.

Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio vs Dolph Ziggler. Just like how Dolph was impressive in their previous encounter, he delivered here again as this was a great opener with Ziggler being able to counter most of Rey's offense that lead to a series of counter wrestling before it was one specific move that cost Dolph the title once again.

Jack Swagger vs M.V.P. These two had a unique angle as this was hyped as culture clash but this was just an average match that really couldn't top the opener & wasn't bad but nothing really memorable to mention here.

Unified Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Big Show vs Cryme Tyme. Honestly, I really don't care for the Jericho/Show tag team combination while at the same time, I am no fan of Cryme Tyme's ""wrestling"". However, this was their best match to date as Cryme Tyme actually held their own here & put on a better performance than I expected. It's no tag team clinic but a better match than it sounds.

Kane vs The Great Khali. I have to be honest that I just fast-foward this match just based on how bad their WrestleMania match was so I can't comment on this one.

D-Generation X vs Legacy. DX had quite the entrance going into this match as they not only brought out their old tank but I think they had more fireworks than the opening pyro. This was my favorite match of the night as this was not the typical DX squash & was allowed to turn into something special as this was one of the best tag team matches in recent WWE history with Rhodes & Dibiase using the classic tag team heel strategy of cutting the ring in half at the times with the crowd just getting heavily into the action throughout. And even though Legacy didn't win, they were heavily put over here.

ECW Champion Christian vs William Regal. This was the real disappointment of the night as they only got 10 seconds which killed this potential show stealer between two underrated performers.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs John Cena. Ironically, this is the same match that main evented SummerSlam two years prior with the difference being that this match was better. This match started off slow with both men trading mat offense before Orton was able to use his calculating style to pick apart Cena before Cena came back with his typical offense with the action going back & forth at times with Orton trying to use the ""champions advantage"" & the match restarting many times before Orton was able to get the clean pinfall victory, much to the delight of the crowd.

TLC Match: World Champion Jeff Hardy vs CM Punk. This match was similar to the Jericho/HBK & Edge/Hardy ladder matches as they tried to make this one stand out by having both men trying to punish each other instead of trying to get the belt with Punk being a great heel throughout & Hardy being the ""human highlight reel"" with moments of both men using the ladder to make their moves more impactful, chair shots that made the crowd cringe at times & Hardy's dive off the ladder onto Punk through the announce table before Punk was able to overcome the odds & win back his title with an aftermath featuring the return of the Undertaker.

Overall, this event had some flops like the Kane/Khali match & the ECW Title match only getting 10 seconds but past that, this was an event that the WWE did a great job in restablishing SummerSlam as one of it's best events of the year.",1251763200,,3561,4.508527131782945
3904150,4,B002C6VMK2,"Intercontinental Championship Match: Rey Mysterio (Champion) vs. Dolph Ziggler
A phenomenal opener. This was a big step up from their match last month, though that match was really awesome as well. Ziggler proved his worth and hit some unique counters on Mysterio, dropkicking him in mid-air to counter a crossbody and hitting some impressive power moves. Mysterio wowed the crowd by countering an attempt by Ziggler to throw him face-first into the top turnbuckle by landing on the top ropes with both of his feet and turning it into a wildly impressive moonsault! Ziggler countered the 619, though Mysterio battled back with some high-flying offense, including a tornado DDT, as well as countering a backbreaker attempt by Ziggler into a roll-up that nearly ended the match. As the match progressed, Mysterio nailed the Seated Senton and Ziggler hit the Fameasser, though neither man could put the other out. Ziggler ate a 619 finally, though he ended up countering the Swan Dive by rolling out of the way. The match was then back in his hands, until Mysterio managed to roll him up following a hurracanrana to get the victory and retain the title again. Winner: Rey Mysterio. Match Rating: 5/5

Jack Swagger vs. MVP
This match was pretty good, though these men can both do much better. Swagger countered some of MVP's signature offense, though MVP grounded Swagger with a flying crossbody to the outside. Back in the ring, both men had a sort of mat wrestling competition for a little while. MVP managed to hit Ball'n, though Swagger would ground MVP, and hit his splash off the second ropes. Swagger countered the Playmaker, though MVP would regain the advantage and nail the move to secure the victory. Winner: MVP. Match Rating: 4/5

Unified WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Chris Jericho and The Big Show (Champions) vs. Cryme Tyme (JTG and Shad Gaspard)
Oh yeah! At first, the match was a little slow, with Big Show beating JTG around and hitting some major chops on him. When JTG and Jericho were in the ring together, it was a fast-paced competition with a ton of high-flying offense, and JTG even countered the Walls of Jericho. JTG ended up tagging Shad in after getting away from Show, and Shad took the game to Show, knocking the big man down with a flurry of offensive maneuvers. Show then started applying submission holds on Shad to wear him down. This led to JTG getting the tag, though Jericho also got the tag and the match continued. JTG was on a roll, ducking the Knockout Punch and straddling Show on the apron. Shad then took Show to the outside with a Cactus Jack-style clothesline. Jericho then locked in the Walls of Jericho, but JTG managed to grab the ropes! Show incapacitated Shad on the outside, hit JTG with the Knockout Punch, and then Jericho got the somewhat weak pin to an otherwise phenomenal match. Winners: Chris Jericho and The Big Show. Match Rating: 5/5

Kane vs. The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh)
A rematch from WrestleMania 23, with the roles switched around, really. Nothing special occured. There was just some basic mat wrestling and such and some strikes, though the match wasn't terrible to watch either. Kane kicked out of Khali's head chop, and then took Khali down with a dropkick to the knees and a DDT to put away the big man. Winner: Kane. Match Rating: 3/5

D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) vs. Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase)
DX's reunion on Raw was cut short by Legacy, so this match was hotly anticipated. And le tme tell you, it delivered. Rhodes and Michaels were great in the ring together as were Triple H and DiBiase. Rhodes was a lot of the reason why the match was so good, and he was smart enough to dodge the Sweet Chin Music multiple times. Triple H took a Dream Street from DiBiase at one point, but Michaels broke up the pin. Rhodes managed to hit the Cross Roads on Michaels at another point, but Triple H ended up breaking the pin. Michaels tried to hit the Sweet Chin Music again on Rhodes, though Rhodes caught his foot and blocked the move. The referee had his hands full with everyone in the ring, and Triple H took this time to lay out Rhodes with the Pedigree, but DiBiase ended up breaking up the pin attempt from Michaels. Triple H and DiBiase brawled on the outside, with Triple H clotheslining DiBiase over an announce table. In the ring, Michaels hit the Sweet Chin Music to pin Rhodes and win the match! Winners: D-Generation X. Match Rating: 5/5

ECW Championship Match: Christian (Champion) vs. William Regal (with Ezekial Jackson and Vladimir Kozlov)
This match was ridiculously short and it was basically a joke match, but it was still kind of entertaining to watch, so I decided to give it a few points. Basically, the bell rang, and Christian hit the KillSwitch on Regal while he was trying to take off his robe to retain the title. No joke. After the match, Ezekial hit his finisher on Christian and Vladimir hit a Chokeslam on him. Regal then applied the Regal Stretch. This rivalry obviously isn't over. Winner: Christian. Match Rating: 3/5

WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. John Cena
This match was pretty awesome, and Cena finally put on a good performance in a singles match after failing to do so at Judgment Day, Extreme Rules, and The Bash. At first, the match was your usual Cena/Orton match, with both men hitting their usual offense, though Orton managed to counter some of Cena's basic offense. Orton countered an Attitude Adjustment attempt by Cena, but Cena managed to counter the Concussion Punt. After this, Cena hit Orton with a back body drop, but when Orton got up, he pushed the referee! The ref called for the disqualification, but then Lillian Garcia announced that Vince McMahon ordered the match be restarted, and if Orton gets disqualified, he loses the title! The match went on for a little bit longer, though Orton then grabbed his title and left the ring! Orton then got counted out, but Garcia announced ANOTHER new announcement from McMahon! The match was restarted, and if Orton got counted out, he could lose the title! A frustrated Orton ran back into the ring and started to attack Cena again. Cena went for the Attitude Adjustment, but Orton countered into an RKO attempt. Cena countered the RKO, but then Cena managed to lock in the STF! Orton nearly got the ropes, but Cena dragged him back into the middle of the ring to reapply the move! A crazed fan then jumped the barricade and tackled a referee, causing Cena to let go of the hold. Orton then hit an RKO using the middle rope on Cena as he went back into the ring, and then capped Cena off with another RKO to pin Cena! Winner: Randy Orton. Match Rating: 5/5

TLC World Heavyweight Championship Match: Jeff Hardy (Champion) vs. CM Punk
Match of the night? You bet! The action started out a bit slow as Hardy and Punk hit their usual offense. Weapons got involved quickly after, with Punk and Hardy using a steel chair on one another in a vicious matter. Punk sidewalk slammed Hardy onto a steel chair after countering Poetry in Motion. The fight then spilled to the outside. Punk set up a table next to the ring, though Hardy gained the advantage on Punk after countering a steel chair attack attempt and then set Punk up on a different table! Hardy went for a splash off the top turnbuckle onto Punk, but Punk rolled off the table and Hardy crashed through! Punk tried to grab the title after this, but Hardy stopped him. Some ladder shots occured after this, with Hardy taking an absolutely nasty superplex onto the ladder! Punk then started dominating here, though his attempts to grab the title were futile. Punk went for his signature knee to the face in the corner/bulldog combination, but Hardy countered by dumping Punk to the outisde and through the table that Punk himself had set up earlier in the match! As the match continued, Punk actually regained the advantage and on the outside, he tried to damage Hardy's throat using a steel chair. Hardy managed to block the move and then beat the living crap out of Punk with the chair. Hardy then took the announce table cover off and smacked Punk in the head with that, followed by a shot to the head using a television monitor. Hardy then SMASHED a steel chair into CM Punk's face as he lay on the announce table, and then he started climbing a 20 foot ladder! Hardy HIT A SWANTON BOMB OFF THE FREAKING 20 FOOT LADDER ONTO PUNK and they both went through the announce table!!! Medical personnel then came out to take Hardy out of the match on a stretcher, but Hardy refused, and as Punk tried to climb to grab the title, Hardy ran back into the ring. They both ended up being at the top of the ladder, but Punk managed to kick Hardy down, grab the title and win. The aftermath was also very awesome and jaw-dropping, and it's definnitely worth checking out. Winner: CM Punk. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
ANOTHER phenomenal pay-per-view from WWE. Better than Night of Champions? Actually, they're just about equal in quality, and that's definitely a good thing. There were a couple of ""bleh"" matches with Kane/Khali and Christian/Regal wasn't even technically a match, but the surprise appearance from The Undertaker at the end of the TLC Match was icing on the cake.

8363311,3,B002C6VMK2,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released. And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July of last year is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events. These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

SummerSlam 2004:
After a year of being the ""Legend Killer"" defeating names from Shawn Michaels to Mick Foley along with having the longest Intercontinental Championship reign of the modern era, Randy Orton main evented the show against World Champion Chris Benoit as he had the opportunity to become the youngest World Champion in history in a match that was very hard fought by both men to the point where you saw a change in Orton by not only showing respect to his opponent but also by how he was received by the fans.  For the first time since WrestleMania XX months earlier, Kurt Angle returned to the ring on PPV against his long-term rival in Eddie Guerrero in a very technical based match that was more aggressive & personal than their previous encounter leading to an instant classic.  Other matches include WWE Champion J.B.L. vs. Undertaker, Chris Jericho & Batista challenging for the Intercontinental Championship against Edge who got a reaction that would start to plant the seeds for a very important turn in his career, Kane vs. Matt Hardy in the infamous ""Till Death Do Us Part"" match where the winner would marry a pregnant Lita, Triple H vs. Eugene, John Cena vs. Booker T in Match 1 of their Best Of 5 Series for the United States Championship, Rey Mysterio & Paul London & Billy Kidman vs. all 3 members of the Dudley Boyz (Bubba, D-Von, Spike), and a segment of ""Diva Dodgeball"" with all the current WWE divas faced the girls of the Diva Search contest.  It should also be noted that part of the DVD extras were all of the commercials for this event that were parodies of the Summer Olympic Games that were just absolutely hysterical.

RAW's Unforgiven 2004:
""What a difference a day makes"" pretty much tells the tale of the main event here as Randy Orton made his first World Championship defense against his former mentor but also the man who turned against him the night after SummerSlam for winning ""his"" championship in Triple H that saw both men trading momentum along with involvement from Evolution to even Johnathan Coachman along with weapons used like a steel chair.  Shawn Michaels returned to the ring for the first time since his Hell In A Cell match to face Kane in a No Disqualification Match in a match that saw anything around ringside used to punish to the point where Shawn was bleeding above his eye which had a long term effect in regards to Shawn's ""lazy eye"" that we still see to this day.  Edge had to forfeit the Intercontinental Championship due to injury resulting in the championship being on the line in a Ladder Match between Chris Jericho & Christian that told a story about both men attempting to use the ladder to injure a body part more than being your ""car crash highspots"" encounter.  Other matches include Chris Benoit & William Regal vs. Ric Flair & Batista, Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Victoria, Tyson Tomko vs. Steven Richards, and World Tag Team Champions La Resistance vs. Rhyno & Tajiri.

Both shows were a mixed bag as you had some good solid wrestling mixed in with matches & segments that were just bad or unmemorable so this is one set that I would only get if you were a fan during this period because you can find most of the quality matches on other DVD sets.",1381708800,,3627,4.628304821150856
