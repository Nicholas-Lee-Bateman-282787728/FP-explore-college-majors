778336,4,6304099959,"An excelent Movie, one that I could watch over and over again. Richard E Grant played the part of Jack really well and you could capture all the emotions and feelings throughout the film. Samantha Mathis also plays her lead well.",1003881600,,229,4.609756097560975
778337,4,6304099959,"First, I have watched this movie over several times in the space of one week, mainly to get the first half-hour, and to watch the expressions on the faces of the baby and Jack as they bond. And the first time I watched, I snuffled my way past three moments... something that I have not done for a long time in watching movies.

Secondly, I admit to renting this movie primarily because of Richard E. Grant and learning a bit about his filmography and his personal life. [For more on both, I recommend his own website]. However, the movie came with a delightful and remarkable bonus - superb turns by notable actors in secondary characters Margaret (Dame Judi Dench, of ""Mrs Brown"", ""Elizabeth"", and the British series ""As Time Goes By"" fame), Philli (Dame Eileen Atkins, who co-developed the classic British series ""Upstairs Downstairs""), and William (Sir Ian McKellen, of ""Gods and Monsters"" and ""Richard III"").

There is a slight frisson in seeing Richard Grant and Ian McKellen in the same movie. Grant plays the Scarlet Pimpernel in the controversial A&E/BBC version that strays from the original storyline. McKellen played Chauvelin in the 1982 version starring Anthony Andrews. Having just seen both versions lent this movie an extra fillip.

Now to the merits of the film itself. It is a maudlin comedy, in that there are comic moments but the film starts off more as a tragedy waiting to happen. And the tragedy does take place quite soon - and Jack, a lawyer who apparently has everything, finds his life falling apart. His bonding with his infant daughter (forced upon him by his relatives) gives him a reason to go on. I found this the strongest part of the film, although I was somewhat upset by omission of facts (such as the manner of Sarah's death) and some improbabilities (the apparent ease with which Jack could absent himself from his job, without being fired).

Jack's breakdown was however portrayed brilliantly, and in watching the beginning a fourth time, I was able to follow the stages of his despair as I had never done earlier. It may be that the accents are slightly strange to me, but multiple viewings allowed me to pick up first this, and then that - only going to showcase the talents of Grant and the supporting actors.

Having bestowed all this praise (and ooohed and aahed over the cute little baby, or baby actors playing the baby), I must say that I was somewhat less convinced over the love affair.  I won't go into details for fearing of spoiling the film for you.  A little personal history for Amy (the nanny) would have helped. All we learn is that she is an American in London, that she knows nothing about child care, and we also learn a little bit about a past relationship.

Keeper status: Very likely, but not definite. You really have to like this kind of film, or just adore British film actors. I love Dench and Grant, but I am not sure I want to add this film to my video collection.

Re-viewing status: Very likely. This film is definitely worth watching again.

This review was originally written June 25, 2001 and edited slightly on October 24, 2004.

Corrections (made 24 Oct 2004):  Dame Eileen Atkins did not play Rose in Upstairs, Downstairs (that role was played by Jean Marsh), and I have edited that accordingly. [My apologies to both actresses, and my thanks to Karen who wrote in]. I also placed the film and series names within inverted commas, and clarified which titles were series.",993340800,32,3448,4.699834162520729
778338,5,6304099959,What I really enjoy about this movie was the way how it shows the moral disorder of Jack's (Richard E. Grant) after loosing his wife. His life is ruined but he has to go on to take care of his little daughter. It is  really difficult to find motivation for further life when you lose  everything you cared of. Jack & Sarah is absolutely incredible in all  of the movie's aspects. Actors are briliant and the story is original and  touching. If you don't know what to do with your life - you must see this  film.,947376000,,511,4.22680412371134

778473,4,6304099959,"SPOILERS:  The first part of this movie is about heart-wrenching grief.  Richard E. Grant's depiction of pain, anger and bitterness never strikes a false note and will leave you feeling wrung out.  The movie then becomes about emotional recovery -- about being brave enough to open a bruised heart to let life and love into it.  Also, if your heart doesn't melt when you see Grant falling in love with his daughter, then you'd better tell the Grinch to move over.",1417478400,,463,4.679012345679013

778577,4,6304099959,"I saw this film the year it came out at a festival, and have never quite been able to forget it, even though I've never seen it promoted anywhere else. The story line is quite formulaic and extremely sentimental, with a few touches that definitely place it with the string of romantic comedy-dramas from the early through mid 1990's.

But there are a few things that elevate it well beyond the mere saccharin that it could have been. First, Richard E. Grant provides a depth of presence and complexity to his role that speaks more of a character actor than a classic leading man. Second, the chemistry between Samantha Mathis and his character is wonderful, and their performances make their relationship far more complicated than their lines might otherwise indicate. Third, the world class performances by veteran actors in the supporting roles breathe dimension into the quirky assortment of people who end up forming into Grant's makeshift extended family. Finally, certain key plot points that might have otherwise been milked for their sentimental or comedic value have been elided either from the script, or left on the editing room floor -- in either case much to the benefit of the film. Leaving these items out announce that this is first and foremost a character piece, not a vehicle for a series of poignant or comedic vignettes.

In the end, it's the inner transformation of Richard E. Grant's character that gives this film its strong central core, as influenced by the interesting mix of supporting characters surrounding him.",1308182400,2,1541,4.992217898832685

I loved the complexity of emotions the main character goes through (do not want to give too much plot away)and the realization of the love that encompasses him and tender adoration towards his new born daughter. The character William is my fav and his antics are a refreshing addition to the storyline. The end result is one of hope and very happy endings with a twist.

Grant and Samantha Mathis, Jack's mother is played by Judi Dench; his mother-in-law by Eileen Atkins and his wacky friend by Ian McKellan -- quite an impressive cast. The beginning is very sad as it depicts a man who is wallowing in the depths of despair over his loss. Slowly he's brought to life by his growing love for his new daughter. At first, he doesn't quite know how to be a parent, but he's helped by Amy, an American girl who becomes the live-in nanny, as well as family and friends.

778643,2,6304099959,"Why does this movie not work?  Let me count the ways.  First, the movie opens with ten minutes of slapstick, fairly decent slapstick.  Then, the slapstick is jettisoned, never to return, and the movie is serious from there on.

The wife dies--off camera, of course--but that's okay, because we can't feel much for her anyway, since we never saw the couple together in a serious or sincere way.  We only saw slapstick.

The character then goes running through the hospital.  This strange behavior is followed by some clichd behavior: throwing furniture around, etc.  This behavior, I suppose, is to let us know that this character is infantile but is going to improve as the movie wears on.  He then rejects his baby.  Okay, we've all seen ""A Christmas Carol,"" so it's credible, Scrooge's father does this.  But the screenwriter didn't bother to ask himself whether we really want to see a movie about Scrooge's father.

When the nanny enters the picture, it begins to have moments that are promising, but these are always dashed by some off-putting behavior or other on the part of the father.  He is shown coming to like his baby, but then unaccountably he spends day and evening away from her.  What are we supposed to make of this?

Richard Grant plays this character, I suppose, as the script dictates, as a kind of screwed-up guy who hasn't a clue and who keeps changing ""color"" from one scene to the next.  So, the ""happy"" ending leaves one with a shrug.

Oh, and there are two musical interludes during which the movie stops for several minutes to let us listen to the selection the writer-director has chosen for us.  Trouble is, the chosen music will not be to everyone's taste.  Extremely so, in my case.

Bottom line: See this movie only if you really, REALLY like one or another of the cast.",1159315200,6,1803,4.663492063492064

7861412,5,6304099959,"It has been many years since I last watched ""Jack and Sarah"" and since I remember it with fondness I decided to look for it. Luckily, someone had uploaded it on Youtube so I settled in to watch it this evening. It is still, thankfully, as delightful as I remember it. The premise is quite generic actually, but the execution is what sets this film apart and makes it memorable among the hordes of romantic dramas.

Jack (Richard E. Grant) is a successful attorney in London who is married to a lovely woman, Sarah (Imogen Stubbs). The couple is expecting their first baby and the early scenes are full of comedic elements as Jack rushes around, trying to get his home remodeled in time for baby's arrival, while also purchasing baby items, and attending birthing classes with his wife. Unfortunately tragedy strikes - Sarah dies in childbirth, and Jack is devastated, drowning his grief in drink while neglecting his duties as a dad to his infant daughter. So Jack's parents and Sarah's mother decide to drop off the baby by a sleeping Jack (in a drunken stupor) one day and wait until he gets up and finally acknowledges he needs to care for his baby.

The scene is thus set for ensuing chaos as Jack tries in vain to juggle his duties as dad and attorney. Finally, out of desperation, he hires an American waitress he met at a restaurant whom Jack thought had good rapport with his baby. The waitress (played by Samantha Mathis) moves into Jack's home (much to his chagrin), but does do a credible job of caring for baby Sarah, despite initial hiccups. The rest of the film sees Jack coming to terms with his loss while also growing into his role as a father.

This is not the usual romantic comedy and although there are comedic moments, the film also touches on grief, and loss, and finding love again. The scenes where Jack spends time bonding with baby Sarah are some of the sweetest moments and very credible. Overall, this is a lovely romantic drama and heartily recommended.",1448668800,,1983,4.611898016997167
