8425242,3,B004DF3S66,"I tried pairing this video with the yoga emergency video for the hips.  I found that even doing the two together, it just wasn't much of a workout.  I didn't feel any physical benefit from doing the videos.  I also found the music really annoying, and there were a couple of poses in the knee video that were really hard on my knees (and I don't have bad knees).",1445731200,,362,4.217391304347826

Kundalini yoga instructor and wellness consultant Kristen Eykel offers this short yoga routine for a Full Leg Stretch, one of five DVDs in her 12-Minute Yoga Emergency Series. The Full Leg Stretch practice is 11 minutes long. The workout begins standing, with Eykel running through a series of poses all on one side of the body before repeating that same series on the other side. Although Eykel generally does not give names for the postures, she includes variations on pyramid pose, runner's lunge, kneeling lunge, kneeling hamstring stretch, and another pyramid variation to finish. Next is a move in which the influence of Eykel's Kundalini teaching seems apparent: she begins in a half squat and then comes to standing, continuing this dynamic pose for approximately one minute. Eykel concludes the practice with toe stretches, ankle circles, and a final ""sat nam.""

Following the yoga routine, there is an approximately 11-minute meditation for legs (about 2 minutes of guided relaxation continuing with 8 minutes of nature sounds) There are also two ""Stressbusters"" on this DVD, each about a minute long: 1) Pets for Stress, and 2) White Noise, which focus on the background sounds of nature in particular. Overall, this Full Leg Stretch DVD offers the option of a short yoga practice providing thorough stretches for the lower body. This routine is a bit more intense than the others in the Yoga Emergency series, and so it may be best-suited to those who already engage in physical exercise. It would make a great routine to add-on after running, weight-lifting, or another exercise session.",1315008000,5,1765,5.017064846416382
