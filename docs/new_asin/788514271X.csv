First of all, the cast was EXCELLENT! NOT ONE unrealistic scene, or bad acting to be found in this movie.  The movements, facial expressions and behaviors of the actors all gave an incredible performance on very real-life situations that I'm sure have occurred in many wealthy households (Arnold Schwarzenneger for one!).

The cinematography was breathtaking.  I never knew Korea was so beautiful.  The script gave an excellent glimpse into Korean culture and behaviors between the wealthy and the servant class.  I actually HATED the wealthy family for their poor treatment of their servants, and the headmaster's ""rape"" of the beautiful, but naive servant girl.

The ending was a bit weird, but it contained a powerful message -- ""the wealthy bourgeoisie will go on and survive -- no matter who they destroy in the process!""

EXCELLENT CHOICE for a foreign film !",1313452800,,1084,5.03932584269663
7900387,5,788514271X,"I was actually looking just for the 2010 remake of ""Hanyo"" a.k.a The Housemaid, and came across this nifty package deal. I previously saw the the 1960 original decades ago at a film festival. The print they used was worn, and missing some sections of the film. Yet, it was one of the best films I had already seen. This DVD set includes a newly remastered and restored version of the 1960 film, along with the 2010 film. Both DVDs are packaged in a single case. There are a few special features for each movie. The 1960 movie has an interesting documentary on how they restored the print. I think the price I paid ($20) was very reasonable and I was very satisfied with the purchase.",1309824000,,683,4.428571428571429
