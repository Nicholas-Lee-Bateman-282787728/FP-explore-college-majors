7922724,4,B00004TJRA,"Wes Craven: The man who brought you ""Nightmare on Elm Street,""
""Scream"" & more! The dvd features everything you want to know
about the famous director with many interviews. I recommend
this good dvd.",1271894400,,199,4.882352941176471
7922725,3,B00004TJRA,"For those who may not know much about Craven than you will find this an informative look into one of the best storytellers around. Craven is a master at what he does except I don't like the Scream trillogy so that was a waste of space where he could of talked more about his other wonderfully crafted films. I got a interesting look into 'A Nightmare On Elm Street', 'Shocker'and,""The Last House On The Left', but not 'The People Under The Stairs which was kind of disappointing. Other than that this is one for the fans. Worth a buy.",1045958400,,534,4.404040404040404
7922726,4,B00004TJRA,"Wes Craven, the man who has written, directed, produced, or edited more than 30 television and feature films such as ""Last House on the Left"", ""Swamp Thing"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", and the recent ""Scream"" trilogy, is finally revealed here in the popular ""The Directors"" series. Wes speaks highly and thoroughly about the making of his films, but keeps quiet about his personal life which he has always done and I respect. Though, it is very informative about his feature films, this DVD neglects to mention almost none of his television work like the new ""Twilight Zone"" of the 80's and his short lived ""Nightmare Cafe"" series. Any fans of ""The People Under the Stairs"" will be sorley disappointed as they pretty much mention the title then move onto ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare."" What can you expect, they had to squeeze 15 films into one hour. Other than that the DVD is great. Wes Craven fans should check it out.",975456000,,922,4.732919254658385
