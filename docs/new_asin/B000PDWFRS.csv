8190598,5,B000PDWFRS,"I'm a very slow rower and after doing the breathing exercises and yoga techniques on the first DVD, I was able to row faster than I ever had before.  These are not technique DVDs, though so I couldn't quite explain it. I thought the yoga postures did help stretch the muscles that get tight with rowing.  I actually got a lot more from these DVDs than I got from any of my Xeno Mueller DVDs (Although those  physically fit and looking for technique pointers might want to look there.)

I never used the strength training DVD (lack of access to equipment.)",1372896000,2,555,4.465346534653466
8190599,2,B000PDWFRS,"This was a real disappointment.  There are three short indoor rowing sessions where one guy has his head cocked to the side the whole time & another looks like he is in pain.  It's not from hard work because these guys are not rowing fast or heavy. The third guy had much better form.  The second DVD is for strength but they neglect to mention you need gym equipment to do it.  If your looking for a good rowing dvd, try the 7 Indoor Rowing Workouts by Xeno Muller.  I wish I could get my money back on The Rower.",1332806400,5,514,4.1
