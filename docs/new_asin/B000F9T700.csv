2556283,1,B000F9T700,"Ren and Stimpy began as a show that pushed the envelope for Nickelodeon, and that was one reason I loved it.  Another was the extraordinary use of creativity throughout each imaginative scenereo.  Sure, gross-out humor and vulgarity gave it its edge, but Ren and Stimpy was not a dull-minded show.  It had SUBSTANCE.

This substance is completely lost in the new ""Lost Episodes"" collection.  I am confused as to why it has such a high rating on this site considering the uproar caused by fans who saw the new series on TNN/Spike TV.  Gross-out humor is replaced with sexually charged animation (which is, in turn, actually grosser).  I only see this DVD set appealing to immature teenage boys or perverted adults.  Excuse the stereotyping, but it helps in proving my point.  The cartooning is not only unfamiliar, but is of no quality (the colorful shading is now black-traced lines with color on the inside).  The art that used to be so versatile and show a different emotion through both Ren and Stimpy by using different drawings of the characters--gone.  The voices, different..even Ren.

Yes, I'm aware that these cartoons were aimed toward an adult audience, but some may be confused when they learn that the cartoons John K. has ""always wanted to do"" are the cheapest possible version of old Ren and Stimpy, and more appropriate for adults who are easily amused with ""funny"" cartoons with a lack of creative content.  Thank goodness this show aired on an appropriate, tasteless channel.

John K., saying this is what you always wanted to do turns the old Ren and Stimpy audience off!  It's almost as if you were calling the glory days of this show obselete.

If you're a fan of the creative and hilarious Ren & Stimpy, don't buy this DVD set.",1147651200,30,1749,4.760797342192691
2556284,5,B000F9T700,"Growing up Ren and Stimpy was always in my top 3 list of favorite cartoons.  But these lost episodes are not the Ren and Stimpy of our childhood.  Nope.  After all those painful years of watching the Games episodes and then the canceling of the show, John K. finally got to make HIS cartoons of Ren and Stimpy the way he wanted to.  I've only seen bits and pieces of these episodes but I loved what I saw.  I say not only those who remember watching Ren and Stimpy should buy this, but all fans of cartoons and cartoon artists.",1145836800,8,527,4.23

2556286,5,B000F9T700,"For ""Ren Seeks Help"" this DVD is worth it alone. It's an amazing 20+ minutes with animation and backgrounds that look better than what you see in most animated movies now. Not only that but it's laugh-out loud hilarious, especially in the last few minutes.

The episodes that didn't air - Naked Beach Frenzy, Altruists, and Stimpy's Pregnant, are similarly great (I have them, I'm not referring to clips). Even the two weakest of the run, Onward and Upward (which unfortunately was the first one that ran) and FireDogs 2, have their moments. Besides, you get to see all the great cartoons without that annoying Spike TV ""Gary The Rat"" 3D in-show promo covering up the animation.

Sure, things have changed over a decade, but R&S: Adult Party Cartoon is wonderfully close to the Ren and Stimpy we know and love and is a refreshing change to most of the barely-animated animation we're subjected to now. Pre-order it!",1145577600,10,915,4.784810126582278

2556288,5,B000F9T700,"Well, guys, here's the scoop on the Lost Episodes DVD set:

All 9 half-hours of the show on a 2-disc set

Video: 1:33:1

Audio: Dolby 2.0/CC

Extras:

-Intros by John K. and Wierd Al
-Interviews with the Top Artists
-Cow and Chicken Creator David Feiss Interview
-Clips of Unfinished Cartoons
-17 APC Animatics
-3 Naked Beach Frenzy Pencil Tests
-APC Model Sheet and Background Art
-Rough Cut-Ren Seeks Help

Ren and Stimpy, as Mr. Burns from the Simpsons would describe, ""has quite a long and colorful history"". It was ressurrected as an adult cartoon on SpikeTV in June of 2003 when four out of nine half-hour episodes had aired as part of a late-night block alongside GARY THE RAT and (shudder) STRIPPERELLA. John K. mentioned in the promo commercials that the premise of the new Ren and Stimpy is that you can do almost anything without having to worry about censorship values. Well, apparently that's where he went wrong.

There are a few changes you will notice here in this new adult cartoon:

First, the artwork and animation has improved over the original show. After all, after a decade's worth of TV and Flash-animated cartoons, John K. and his crew had enough experience under their belts. Second, Billy West doesn't return to play the role of Stimpy. Eric Bauza takes his place, and does play a pretty damn good voice of Stimpy.

Now on to the episodes:
The first one, ONWARD AND UPWARD, was inspired by fan letters who wanted to see an entire episode of gross-out gags. Yet, this episode recieved so many angry online comments stating that their favorite childhood characters just turned to [...]. It seemed pretty obvious Spike aired the weakest episode first.

However, the show got it's mojo with the second episode, REN SEEKS HELP, which explore's Ren's youth as Ren tries to figure out why is he so mean and insane. The third one, FIREDOGS 2, while not as funny as the second, brought the famous cartoonist Ralph Bakshi into the animated world.

These were all Nickelodeon-underdeveloped ideas, though; in other words, they were just old stories never brought up when Spumco was working for R&S on Nickelodeon. The new ideas, or rather the five remaining episodes (four of which are two-parter episodes), proved too risque to actually AIR on television. NAKED BEACH FRENZY, especially showed some material that even South Park couldn't top with 30 minutes of half-naked women on the beach; ALTRUISTS has the most funny and risque gags than any other R&S episode; and STIMPY'S PREGNANT displayed the first-ever onscreen natural childbirth and...well, you get the rest.

Nonetheless, with these entertaining (both aired and unaired) episodes, this 2-disc set is no doubt gonna sell like hot cakes--probably even more than the original show's DVD sets, and we'd all be in prayer of a Direct-to-DVD ressurrection for Ren and Stimpy.

And it's all thanks to the DVD market. As Stimpy would say, ""We owe it all to our new best friend.""",1144454400,19,2948,4.88376753507014

2556308,1,B000F9T700,"Heres the short review: This DVD set is an abomination.

Heres the longer review: Im a fan of the original Ren and Stimpy, particularly the episodes where creator John Kricfalusi was involved. I bought this DVD set thinking that these episodes would be something like the once great Ren and Stimpy in its early days. I was proven wrong. It was an absolute chore to actually sit and watch these episodes. So whats wrong with it all? Lots of things. (A few spoilers below.)

First, my one positive for the show: The animation is beautiful. It is unbelievable how good the animation is on a TV budget. Its fantastic, and those crazy facial expressions are back. Now, onto the negative.

Why do we need to get into Ren and Stimpys sexuality? They are gay here. This would appear to have been done for humor. The problem is, its not funny. Its actually disturbing. Who wants to see sexuality coming from cartoon animals? When Ren and Stimpy are gay, its uncomfortable to watch. And in Naked Beach Frenzy, when we get to see Ren getting excited by the hot girls at the beach, its just as uncomfortable to watch. Stimpy getting pregnant and developing female breasts? Stimpy French Kissing a duck? This stuff doesnt provide humor. Its rather a bunch of lame jokes designed to make this show more adult, and yet more stupid.

Why is this series so mean-spirited? Sure, Ren was always a jerk. But it was funny in the old series. Here, its taken to a whole new level. Ren is not likeable at all here. In Ren Seeks Help, those flashbacks to Rens childhood are not funny. Theyre just psychotic and painful to watch. Mean comedy can be funny, but its all about balance. Heres its all mean. How can you root for someone you don't like? How can mean comedy be funny when the comedy is gone and its all just mean?

In the episode introductions, I love how John K. likes to bring up classic cartoons such as Looney Tunes and Popeye, as though they were an inspiration to him. Those animated shorts had class. These dont. Those shorts should not even be mentioned alongside this mess. Also, when John K. talks of one episode being inspired by The Three Stooges, that inspiration didn't amount to much. Having gags where Ren simply punches Stimpy in the face and material like that doesnt work here, where Ren is already a complete jerk. Violence was funny on The Three Stooges because it was slapstick and balanced with other humor, but the violence is just forced here.

Gross-out humor was always a part of Ren and Stimpy. Here, it goes too far and is just plain disgusting at times. Do we really want to see the characters eating a mans vomit? Or Ren getting mouth-to-mouth from a hairy man and then swallowing a huge pile of the mans hair?

I watched these six episodes waiting and waiting and waiting for things to get better. They dont. I laughed maybe one time per episode. Most of the time I was cringing or checking the clock. This is not comedy. Its all material done for shock value. How gross can we be? How dark and twisted can we get? How uneasy can we make the audience? These are the questions that the creators of this show must have pondered.

You know that feeling when you watch something great and it stays with you long after? Well this is the opposite of that. Do yourself a favor and avoid watching these so you don't have to be haunted by the painful memories of what you saw like I now am.",1454457600,33,3397,4.476575121163166

And with so many other options that can pull off funny AND shocking (Family Guy, Archer, even South Park at very rare moments), I totally understand why it was short lived. It's not BAD per say, it's just not great. The original Ren & Stimpy invented the wheel. It paved the way for more adult cartoon shows, but was still acceptable for children. The originality is gone.

2556322,2,B000F9T700,"Another long-time fan of the original Ren & Stimpy chiming in. I grew up on this show and I still watch it to this day, and when I spotted this particular DVD at a game store, I was thrilled. Holy crap, Ren & Stimpy cartoons I've never seen?! GIMME! Needless to say, I was not impressed. The short version is that this just did not feel at all like the good old misadventures of Ren Hoek and Stimpson J. Cat that I'd known and loved for years.

The animation quality was kind of hit and miss. Yes, there are crazy, skewed facial expressions, but... it's just not the same. The original show just had a particular charm and feel to it which this one didn't have at all. It seemed like John K. was just trying to make the most disgusting possible cartoon with this collection, and while I certainly wasn't offended, there was no room for genuine humor because every other second was something stupid and/or gross. Don't get me wrong - when I think of tasteless toilet humor, I immediately think of the dog and cat duo from the 90s screaming, slapping, burping and farting their way through episodes. But the original show also had actual plots, clever jokes and segways, and little touches that were always in the perfect place to ensure maximum hilarity. Characters had depth, and while there was no chronology, everything managed to make sense while, at the same time, making no sense at all... and that's what made it so awesome. These lost episodes are devoid of all those things, and what you'll see are a completely different Ren and Stimpy that just aren't that funny anymore. Though I will give it credit for the episode ""Onward & Upward"" which is quite possibly the only cartoon to ever make me truly nauseous. But hey, most people would feel at least a little churn of the stomach watching Ren and Stimpy eating vomit in a spittoon.

The voice acting is garbage; Stimpy's voice sounds deeper and more serious, and while John K. provided Ren's voice again, it just sounded really forced, which I guess is expected when he's trying to get back in character after a decade of not being the little mosquito. The music doesn't quite work, it looks like some of the animating was done in Flash, and really the only thing this has going for it is getting to see adult themes (sex, drinking, smoking, etc.) and hear some cursing. But here's the thing: classic R&S was good enough that it didn't need the sexual themes or swearing to be funny.

Basically, these six adult episodes lack silliness. Yes, there was only so much you could do in cartoons that would bypass the censors (and John K. got a LOT of stuff past them), but the stupidity is what gave the show its irresistible charm. The Lost Episodes were a disappointment as far as I'm concerned, and you really won't be missing much by not buying this. The only thing this DVD has in common with the original series are the character names and designs (Mr. Horse shows up, as does the fire chief, who proceeds to morph into Ralph Bakshi), and some of the music (which is used kind of poorly at times). There are no ""in-betweens"" in this collection either. Things like Dog Water, Billy the Beef Tallow Boy, Colonel Backwash's Chicken in a Drawer... remember those little jingles between episodes or at the end of the show? None of those here, which is a shame, as those were some of my favorites.",1423872000,15,3351,4.5447019867549665

2556325,5,B000F9T700,"All the problems with audio and animation were caused by Spike too! The reason John K got fired from the original show was for not making deadlines and of course Spike rushed these episodes out the door to lower quality.

Most stories were said to be ressurected from stories not used in the early 90's before Nickelodeon kicked the creator out the door. I find them highly entertaining even though he went extreme on adult humour (Which is what Spike wanted for the man's network)

It's honestly hit or miss while I enjoyed all the Adult Party Cartoon episodes most fan's of the original may feel the difference with out the guy who does the gross Paintings, No Billy West and no Bob Camp.  It was at least good to have one last look at what our old pals Ren and Stmpy were up to, since it is unlikely Viacom will ever sell the characters back to John.

If John could get rights back it would be best for him to get on Kickstarter like he is doing with his latest Cartoon, Can's Without Labels which was funded in 2013. It is now finally near the end of development.
 If this version and the original series were given all the time they really need they would be 100 times greater. (Just like they wasted money on animaton in 30's to 50's)

I'm sure any cartoon he creates on his own time with out Network Executives breathing down his throat or telling him to put gay jokes and nude scenes will be of a hundred times better quality.

2556338,1,B000F9T700,"I was an avid viewer of Ren & Stimpy during the Nickelodeon days.  The show was crazy and tasteless but still had heart.  When I heard about these so called ""lost episodes"", I immediately purcahsed my set.  Well to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.  Gone was the Ren & Stimpy I knew and replaced by these two unpleasant things.  First, the lost episodes are very mean spirited.  Second, there is unnecessary genital scenes and allusions to sex.  But worst, Ren & Stimpy are now gay lovers!?!?!  I mean if that's what they are, fine.  But it was never eluded to in any of the previous episodes.  Why is it in the lost episodes, they are suddenly homosexuals?  And they make it a point to really emphasize it throughout the show.  In one episode, Stimpy gets impregnated by Ren.  There is nothing wrong with gay characters, but changing much loved or established characters ruins the show for me.  Its like if you suddenly made Abbott and Costello or Bert and Ernie or Laurel and Hardy gay.  Plus why is it necessary to even show the sexuality of cartoon characters?  Gay or straight, I don't want to know what's going on in the bedroom between two cartoon animals.",1407024000,6,1180,4.574162679425838

However, the stuff is sick!!!

I am going yo have to appreciate Nickelodeon's censorship and direction because in the first episode of the Adult Party cartoon, Ren and Stimpy are eating mucus and vomit, as if it were gourmet food.  Then there is another episode where Ren's mouth is filled with hair from the lifeguard as mouth to mouth is performed on a presumably drowning Ren Hoek.

The voices are so terrible and the voice acting over all is terrible.  The animation is nothing like the old ones.  The only thing this has are the original writers.  They too are at fault for writing these terrible episodes.  The only thing that is recognizable is the fact that it says ""Ren and Stimpy"" and it has the characters on the screen.

2556359,1,B000F9T700,"Update: The DVD loses its appeal fast.

Fans of the original 90's Ren & Stimpy, beware. In 2004 when Spike TV bought the rights to Ren & Stimpy writer, director, creator, and animator John K. approached Spike's CEO's. Throughout the myriad of fan-mail he'd received from as far back as the early 90's when the show premiered some ideas were presented to John K. from fans for episodes. John K. also took it upon himself to throw some episode scripts he'd held onto that Nickelodeon had found ""too extreme"" for their audiences. With the green light from Spike TV and lee-way to do absolutely whatever he wanted, John K. inevitably...went to an even higher extreme.

Viewer beware...Your mind will not make it out of a single episode intact.

All around an amazingly well done collection featuring one-on-one interviews with John K. himself introducing each episode. Each interview adds unparalleled depth to the already endeared show and the history behind its origins and creator. Pack that with the six episodes made for Spike TV in their raw and absolutely uncensored format (they show it ALL...I'm not kidding folks) and you're in for a total mind-frag.

Though lacking in other special features the interviews and episodes speak for themselves. All around a great collection. My vote: (If you're a fan) definitely a buy. If you've never seen the show and are looking to get into it you may want to watch some of the original show first, which you can find here on Amazon easily. Alternately if you're just looking for the sickest, grosses, absolutely most gut-wrenchingly disgusting (but HILARIOUS) cartoons you can ever in your wildest dreams imagine, this is the collection for you.",1274227200,4,1688,4.954063604240282
2556361,5,B000F9T700,"These episodes are worth the price of admission... defintely. The first cartoon on the disc, Nake Beach Frenzy, has made me laugh more consistently then any other cartoon I've watched in my whole life. Stimpy's pregnant, the second one, is also really, really funny, and actually quite informative/perseptive as well. The animation in them continues in the old Ren and Stimpy pattern and conintues to find new ways to make us laugh giving up new ways of looking at the characters every time we wee them. He plays around with using words on the screen more then in the originals and some of the drawings are incredible. The voice acting in Simpy's pregnant is awesome.

If you loved the first couple of seasons when John was at the helm and if your actually a John K fan then these cartoons will not dissapoint. There are still the old gross out jokes from the originals but there is also so much more. Don't dweel on the couple of poo jokes, look at the whole package.

2556364,2,B000F9T700,"First of all, I'd like to say that I LOVE Ren and Stimpy.  I've been a fan since the early 90's and when I heard that there were new episodes coming out on Spike TV in 2003 back in the summer of 2002, I was absolutely thrilled.  A year passes by and the big night appears; new episodes of Ren and Stimpy have finally come.  I guess because of the hype and my immaturity back then, I actually thought the episodes were good.  Fast forward three years later and when I heard that those episodes were released on DVD as the ""Lost Episodes"" AND they included episodes that were too ""hot"" for cable TV.  Again, I ate it up.  However, looking at those episodes now, I'm rather ashamed of myself for my opinions in the past.

Looking at these episodes now, I realize they have practically none of the charm that the older Ren and Stimpy episodes have had.  The ""classic"" Ren and Stimpy episodes were exercises in sheer visual and mental insanity coupled with proper usage of ""gross out"" humor, which gave Ren and Stimpy the charm we grew up with and love.  The new episodes are merely exercises in overdone ""gross out"" humor coupled with abuse of profanity since they were on a cable channel for more adult audiences.  Take a look at the classic episode ""Stimpy's Invention.""  It wasn't that gross, but boy was it INSANE.  It had Ren and Stimpy move like jello while bouncing their butts together singing along to a really weird song (""Happy Happy, Joy Joy"") AND has Ren smashing his Happy Helmet with a ball-peen hammer.

With the exception of ""Ren Seeks Help,"" all of that insanity is gone in the new episodes.  ""Onward and Upward,"" the first ""new"" Ren and Stimpy episode, is only an excercise in profanity and having us gag while Ren and Stimpy munch on the delightful things flung into a bar spittoon such as boogers and vomit; not to mention crass humor about Ren and Stimpy being homosexual.  Looking at this episode now, I barely giggled.  ""Ren Seeks Help"" is the only decent episode on this collection because it dwelled on Ren's insanity and utilized the ""messed up"" background art that were so prevalent in the ""classic"" episodes.  Other ""new"" episodes like ""Naked Beach Frenzy"" and ""Stimpy's Pregnant"" play up the whole ""offensive humor"" factor since the former dwells on female nudity while the latter dwells on sickening the viewer (particularly towards the end when Mr. Horse finds out that Stimpy isn't pregant; he's constipated).

At the end of the day, it's really no surprise why these are ""lost episodes"" of Ren and Stimpy.  Go get yourself the DVD volumes of the ""classic"" Ren and Stimpy episodes if you haven't already; heck, the Games Animation episodes of Ren and Stimpy are lightyears better than the ""Lost Episodes.""",1263081600,8,2734,4.658333333333333
2556365,4,B000F9T700,"I honestly laughed out loud at every one of these episodes. Yes they're gross and sick and twisted, juvenile and silly. So were the early episodes. Only these are more so. They are adult, and they are the episodes John K pitched to Nick back in the day that they passed on.

It seems to have ""offended"" people here who remember the ""old"" shows as being more ""appropriate."" Whatever. The Don't Wizz episode was somehow less offensive?

The thing to realize here (and if you watch the 'extra crap' you won't have a chance to ignore it) is that these episodes were created without interference from studios, focus groups or illiterate script wannabes. They were created by people who love animation the way it should be made: real humans painting real cells, voice talent with inspired scripts, bits and pieces, and the sophomoric mind of John K.

Don't forget: John and his team, along with Ralph Bakshi, broke the animation business out of a 10 year zombie-like lull that brought you Smurfs and Strawberry Shortcake. He's a hero, and these 'toons are heroic.

The episodes drag on and on and on - they are much longer than the earlier incarnations.  The 'sex' part refers to the first episode which has a few bouncing boobs/ balls (kinda funny), then drags on forever.  The other episodes don't have the 'sex' part, but do drag on forever after the plot dies.  John K + Weird Al comment on each episode(for a long time)and one must fast forward through it just to get to the cartoon.

These haven't ruined Ren & Stimpy for me - there are better seasons/ collections though.  Not worth the money, unless you get them for free.",1237334400,5,664,4.349593495934959

2556368,2,B000F9T700,"If this wasn't Ren & Stimpy, it would probably deserve 4/5 Stars. The thing is, that it IS Ren & Stimpy and by John K.

The beauty of the original John K's Ren & Stimpy is the fact that they were able to tell sex and gross jokes, so subtile and get away with it having the audience wonder if Ren & Stimpy were really gay in fact, of course this ""gay thing"" being the least important on the list of strengths the cartoons had (the plot being the most).

Plots on Adult movie cartoon are poor and non-sense: Stimpy's pregnant ? Who didn't see that one coming? Humor is not smart and if you're looking for any of the classic lines and scenes such as immortal ""CALL THE POLICE!"" on Rubber Nipples Salesmen, the Dog's speech at the beginning of Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen or Ren's speech on Space Madness, forget it because you won't get them here. Ren seeks help and Fire Dogs part 2 may be the best episodes; quite good in fact but still not up there with the Spunco originals. Apart from them you feel like you're watching a very good English speaking Hentai cartoon with some really gross, pointless and disgusting jokes. The real original inventive and smart humour is simply gone forever.

I expected more from John K's commentary, however it's really boring and he doesn't really say anything interesting or worth the watch. You just want to tell him to shut up.

I own Seasons 1 and 2 and I tell you I never get tired of watching them because they're so brilliant, however this DVD is worth only a few views only before it starts getting real old. It really makes me wonder on how John K. needed Bob Camp's and Chris Reccardi's more than Camp and Reccardi needed John K.",1217548800,5,1676,4.396774193548387

2556371,1,B000F9T700,"These lost episodes were unwatchable. It was really like watching a different cartoon. No aspect of this resembled the original ren & stimpy show. All of the charm and humor from the original cartoons is gone.

THE LOOK:
The background paintings are high quality, but the animation of the characters is terrible. Ren & Stimpy don't look like they did in the original show, they look like different cartoon characters. One of the best things about the original show was the endless amount of funny facial expressions. But the facial expressions and movements in these new ones are bland, lifeless and unfunny. I didn't laugh at one facial expression throughout the DVD. There also are none of the signature ""high detail painting stills"" from Scott Wills.  The animation resembled the animation from the cartoon ""Cow and Chicken"", not the original Ren & Stimpy.

THE SOUND:
Billy West does not do any voices in these cartoons, which is a big minus.  John K. does the voice of Ren, but strangely, it doesn't sound anything like Ren from the originals. The guy who does Stimpy isn't even close, and it isn't funny either. The same production music is used, but it is used poorly. The music doesn't sync with what's going on, and doesn't add to the drama or humor of the episode.

THE WRITING & HUMOR:
The only joke in these episodes is to hear Ren & Stimpy swear, smoke and show their private parts. It makes you chuckle the first time you hear it, but gets old very quickly. Its just obscene for the sake of being obscene. There's no creativity involved in the writing or gags.

CONCLUSION:
I am a huge fan of Ren & Stimpy. I even liked the later episodes from Games Animation. But these lost episodes were unwatchable. Ren & Stimpy fans will probably buy this out of curiosity, but I strongly suggest not wasting your money on this set. I suggest buying ""Seasons 1 &2"" and ""Seasons 3 and a half"". The ""Lost episodes"" and ""Season 4/5"" are not worth buying.",1207008000,30,1953,4.630057803468208
2556372,5,B000F9T700,"Oh mercy. Ren & Stimpy are back in fresh new episodes that are most definitely rated R -- very R.

You probably know already if this is for you - there's not much middle ground when it comes to this show, it's a love it or loathe it situation for most. (And if you dislike Ren Hoek & co., there's really no reason to read any further).

For those who mourned the passing of TV's most bizarre show (more bizarre than all the imitators, by the way - though R&S was obviously a huge inspiration to animators and comedy writers, there was something deeply twisted going on that's hard to quantify and harder to imitate), this one's for you. Two discs of uber-twisted adventures, complete with topless beach-babes, tumescent chihuahua parts, and one terribly tortured frog.  And what seems like hours of interviews and talking-head stuff -- interesting at first, but ultimately interminable. The producers seem to get that as well, with constant titles telling you which button to press to reach the Good Stuff.

And the Good Stuff is great; who knew Ren could knock Stimpy up, even after it was attempted by mormons, the postman, and a crew of ""strapping young boy scouts""? You'll learn about Ren's troubled childhood and see Stimpy's stinky love-child. You'll see jiggly cartoon bosoms and one seriously clogged toilet.

Standouts here are ""Stimpy's Pregnant"", ""Ren Seeks Help"" and the amazing ""Naked Beach Frenzy"". I've shown the latter to several friends, just to watch the spasms of freaked-out laughter at the words ""shampoo master"". If a single moment can summarize years of whacked-out creative output, Stimpy's call of ""shampoo master"" may be the ultimate swan song for this truly insane series.

I think the creators lost sight of all the things that made Ren and Stimpy so wonderful.

I guess when animators feel that they are funnier when they rely just on smut and low brow humor it loses its appeal if its done in a crass way. Watching these new versions of a classic show which was made for kids but appealed to adult sensibilities was revolutionary in its day and that was Ren and Stimpy. However, watching this show without the puns and a direct full frontal assault on the eyes and ears is no longer amusing but borderline offensive. This review may make me sound like a prude but I also come from the old school of die hard, carry on (dear I say) showgirls era of film and TV and this let me down.

 The animation itself is beautifully drawn and the production values again are as good if not better than the original. Just the jokes fall flat.
Watching the classics and spotting what they put into a children's show is so much funnier and had this show been originally made i doubt it would have the fan base it had and probably a different fan base all together, not inclusive of me.",1197331200,4,1084,4.334975369458128

The animation has also improved greatly since the original cartoon as well...however the highly detailed stills that used to appear in the show are now gone unfortunately. The original title of Adult Party Cartoon certainly gives you an idea of what to expect from the episodes contained on these two discs, as they contain violence, swearing, nudity, some extremely crude humour (especially in Stimpy's Pregnant) and some none too subtle sexual references. Also you get interviews with John K and some of the animation crew for each episode explaining what the idea behind the episode and other facts.

And it's good to see that I am not the only one who enjoys real animation and not this market driven 3D garbage that's passing for art these days. This said, the episodes I found were too few. Naked Beach Party of course is very adult, more ranchy than funny but funny nontheless. The other episodes seemed funnier. I certainly hope John K. makes more of these cartoons even if he has to send them to the direct to video circuit. There are simply few cartoons aimed towards adults who enjoy animation and not necessarily anime which has become a tired genre as most of it is aimed low for the kiddy market. Keep John K. We need more output from you and your fellow Spumco artist. Animation is circling the drain right now.",1184716800,7,980,4.4804469273743015

true, they are done in a more adult context which they were always intended to be, but I cant help but feel some of it is a little overboard.

If you are a die-hard ren and stimpy fan, I recommend this to you. I personally think the overt sexual connotations and abstract story lines aren't for me.

If you are a fan of the careless, stupid and somewhat childish ren and stimpy, then i don't suggest this two disc set.

2556381,3,B000F9T700,"If you love Ren & Stimpy for the reasons I do you may find my review helpful. I became a fan of Ren Hoek back in the 90s because he is evil and nasty and because he is tromped on. I am also a fan of some of the Games Animation episodes, which were made without John K, because they continued to humorously exploit Ren's evil/oppressed nature.

REN SEEKS HELP is a success. ALTRUISTS and STIMPY'S PREGNANT, while not containing what I traditionally like about Ren & Stimpy, are nonetheless entertaining. NAKED BEACH FRENZY, ONWARDS AND UPWARDS, and FIRE DOGS are flops.

ALTRUISTS - As John K says, the Three Stooges are a big influence here. Contains some clever ironies and is fun to watch. Some of the material harkens back to the earlier episodes. And I like seeing Ren care about someone on occasion.

FIRE DOGS - Is entirely about a fat, hairy lummox. Fans who disliked the Games Animation episodes complained that Ren & Stimpy were two-dimensional and too inactive in them; yet, what are they in this? Ren and Stimpy are basically passive here, looking like children being led along by the hand as they wander wide-eyed through the creature's disgusting world of filth. Perhaps this is proof that John K's contribution to the series was overrated. If a bulging beast is your cup of tea, then you'll love this one. For me, laughing and vomiting do not go hand in hand.

NAKED BEACH FRENZY - Not so much offensive as totally unfunny. Unlike FIRE DOGS and ONWARD AND UPWARD, can be watched while eating. Since when is bouncing cleavage funny? John, you can do so much better. Why go to lengths elsewhere on the DVD to show us that Ren & Stimpy are gay and then show them oogling naked women?

ONWARD AND UPWARD - This is where John K lets it be known with certainty that Ren and Stimpy are gay. I preferred the episodes of yesteryear where the homosexuality was only implied and one was left to wonder about it, unlike now where it is literally spelled out on a chalkboard. I like to think of Ren and Stimpy as hapless chums who met up on the road of life and chose stay together out of resignation. The cartoon is gross-out and not funny. I'd rather watch AN ABE DIVIDED and see Ren treated like a booger than see him eat a booger.

REN SEEKS HELP - Now this is the Ren I know and love! This episode alone makes the DVD worth buying and owning. Here we see Ren in his (very) evil mode and we learn the origins of his cruelty. We also meet his parents for the first time. The episode opens with Ren having done something so terrible to Stimpy that Ren has crossed the line this time and Stimpy will not forgive him. So off Ren goes to the psychiatrist (played by Mr. Horse) to get help and to recount in detail the horrific things he did in his youthful, preStimpy days. Seeing a mangled amphibian hobbling around on crutches, yelling at Ren to ""Finish me off, you bastard!"" really made me laugh. Add a new Ren & Stimpy character to my favorites: Mr. Frog! It would be great to see Mr. Frog in future episodes, although that is probably not possible since Ren admits to never having heard about Mr. Frog again since his childhood and since Mr. Frog appears to take matters into his own hands at the end, doing what Ren refused to do. Ren does something at the doctor's office to one of the orderlies that is so unexpectedly shocking and gruesome it makes you question if you ever realized just how psychotic he is.

STIMPY'S PREGNANT - Pays homage to I LOVE LUCY and contains cute ""audience applause."" And is the ending a nod to Mr. Hankey? Ren is a macho pig with his dutiful and dim-witted ""wife"" hurdling obstacles like an Olympic athlete in order to satisfy Ren's every whim. Maybe I liked this episode because I've known couples like this in real life. It made me smile and the next time I see Ren getting ripped to shreds in a beef jerky machine I'll enjoy it all the more.

The profanity throughout is not excessive, but I would have liked to have heard ""you bloated sack of protoplasm!"" at least once instead of the ""F"" word. ""Bloated sack"" is memorable and unique. The ""F"" word is not.

Interview-style commentaries from the creators precede each episode and the disks contain preliminary sketchings of the cartoons for those interested. The episodes are longer than the 15-minute episodes from seasons 1 through 5.

If these episodes had been aired in the 90s they might have found acceptance, or at least less criticism. While I personally cannot recommend every episode on this set, it may be safe to say that there is something here for everyone. Perhaps the creators planned it that way.",1178323200,5,4604,4.489844683393071

2556384,1,B000F9T700,"As a kid, I grew up with Ren and Stimpy, which aired on Nickelodeon. Because that is a young adult/children's channel, Ren and Stimpy had to be molded into the image of a relatively appropriate show. And I think because of this censorship, the show was actually able to become so iconic. It is easy to be blatant and crude, but when you have to work around certain obstacles to get your point across, that is when things become more interesting, and more creative. The beauty of the Ren and Stimpy episodes aired on Nickelodeon was the fact that they could still manage to be hilariously crude, but it was on a level where kids wouldn't get it, while adults would and could laugh and think ""Hey, that's really clever. Stupid, but clever."" With that in mind, if you take away the need to overcome the obstacle of portraying a message without infringing on the censorship rules, you take away the essence and creativity of Ren and Stimpy. And that is basically what is happening with ""The Lost Episodes"". I watched one and it was decidedly not worth my time. They are extremely crude, uncreative, and uninspired. Even the introduction by the creators was drab. Though, I will admit, there were a few times I laughed. I could see someone watching it with their friends just to laugh at how ridiculous and different it is. Sort of like a ""Oh my goodness, this is so bad!"" kind of laughter. I would not recommend this DVD if you are a hardcore fan of the ""old"" Ren and Stimpy. This DVD encompasses nothing of the great past episodes. It's just a collection of very adult situations, a poorly executed experimentation with how weird and estranging the creators could make Ren and Stimpy, both the characters and the show itself.

2556386,4,B000F9T700,"Ren and Stimpy have come a long way from their days on Nickelodeon. If you are not into adult humor then I would fully recommend that you stay away from this series. If you are sick, disturbed and perverted, then you have found your cartoon source. These episodes are not, and I repeat not!!, recommend for children. These episodes have the cast swearing and women's nipples are flying around everywhere! I've said it before and I will say it again, this is not for children at all!

The special features are fairly interesting, but get old over time and there isn't much variety. What I do like is the introduction to the DVD by Weird Al and John K. John K does a great job on each episode introduction that he also does. He tells the inspiration and people behind the stories. Almost every other extra wasn't that interesting, they all have more interviews from the crew but they just aren't that interesting. It is mainly just giggling and not saying anything important or nothing new that John K. hasn't already said. Pencil and art tests are also included, but nothing interesting once again, just black and white versions of the episodes that were already seen in full color.

The episodes themselves are joke after joke, leaving little for story and more about fitting as many jokes in as possible, John K. even admitted to doing this. Even with that said, there is a story to each episode and this series is still funny! Even though it is all mostly adult humor, it is still very funny.

Horrably annoying cartoon women bouncing around for half the cartoon is not my idea of funny.  Of course, is not sexy, it's just creepy.  Lastly, half of these cartoons seem to be nothing more than inside jokes and stories from the cartoonists.

2556390,2,B000F9T700,"While there are a few worthwhile moments on these discs (mostly in Ren Seeks Help), in general they're uninspired and tedious.  The writing is bland and shallow and focuses too much on being able to do the stuff they weren't allowed to do before.  It's great to be uncensored and unfettered, but when all you do is take advantage of the opportunity, it's easy to forget to deliver actual entertainment, too.  There's also a tendency to draw things out much longer than necessary, almost like the artists wanted to show off their work, dwelling on certain shots and motions for inexplicably long periods.  I would get bored in the middle of scenes, waiting for them to get to the (inevitable and obvious) punchlines.

Other than John's voicing of Ren, and Ralph Bakshi's cameo, the voice acting is uneven and monotonous.  The animation lipsync is pretty erratic as well, sometimes bang on, sometimes boggling bad, like they changed the joke afterwards and didn't feel like re-animating.

Remarkably, the reason why I give this two stars (instead of the minimum of one) is the extra material with John talking about the show and various bits of animation industry trivia.  He's actually quite entertaining and made it worth the bother to have watched these discs.  Frankly, I'd rather have spent the whole time listening to him than watching the lost episodes.

Really, other than Ren Seeks Help, these episodes are some pretty weak tea, and that's being kind.  I boggle at some of the 5-star reviews and look at them suspiciously.

In these episodes, Ren & Stimpy go to a beach filled with voluptuous young girls who like to get naked, try to help out a homeless widow (an homage to the Three Stooges), get in over their heads with an insane fire chief, and look to move out of the bum's mouth that they've been living in.  Stimpy is also pregnant with Ren's love child (the results of which are hysterical, to me anyway, others may find it to be way too much), and Ren goes to a shrink to reveal the origin of his violent ways.  There's interviews and introductions aplenty with John K. and a few others, which are more than worth the price of admission alone.

You could smoke pounds of marijuana and not be able to think this stuff up. Ren and Stimpy living inside a bum's mouth? Bizarre! Stimpy gets pregnant with Ren's love child? Unspeakable! The usual puritan taboos are shattered as the cartoon duo explore issues of nudity, gender bending, unsanitary situations, psychoanalysis, and more.

PLUS, we have interviews of the very staff members who produced these amazing works of craziness, including THE MAN HIMSELF. See the twisted genius who thought up this dysfunctional set of characters. Hear his tales of slogging through the bad old days of cookie cutter cartooning to bring us a brave new world of spirited animation. Feel his energy crackling through your viewscreen. Witness how he passes the baton of excellence to his proteges. Woo!

The interviews are little bit rambling and unfocused, so you might find yourself clicking the ""skip"" button. Also, I felt that some of the episodes were not quite polished. The beach girls episode for example was a little rough around the edges, especially the big hairy lifeguard scenes.

For my money, ""Naked Beach Frenzy"" ""Fire Dogs II"" (though sadly missing its unique live action wraparound here) and ""Stimpy's Pregnant"" take the awards as the stellar efforts in this collection, with ""Altruists"" winning a special platinum lawn cigar as the most purely experimental cartoon done in the past twenty years by anyone, anywhere. It took the DVD format, with its lack of concrete time schedule constraints, for the latter example to truly shine. If people can spend days poring over Peter Jackson's supplemental video navel lint while reading his boring, relentlessly self-serving production diaries, John K. can be indulged in making a 45 minute, purely comedic cartoon short. The added value live action interviews are really groundbreaking, providing the unwashed public a jarring peek into what the Reverend Jim Jones might have done with a video camera pointed at a sofa filled with his most avid, yet visibly ill-at-ease disciples, lit with a bare 90 watt generic bulb purchased on sale at Wal-Mart.

It has always been one of the few funny cartoons out there, coming out roughly the same time of the Simpsons during that awkward time when the Simpsons just were not funny yet. It really paved the way for a lot of great animation that came after it. R&S blazed a new trail in animation instead of re-hashing old Tex Avery or Chuck Jones type animation.

R&S had a style and taste all it's own from the style of animation to the way it told it's stories and the akward pauses and extreme close ups. The show turned me on to animation and made me want to draw and animate, at the time it came out every cartoon was a re-hashed version of another older unfunny cartoon. A Pup named Scooby Doo, the Flintstone Kids, The Tom and Jerry Kids.....they all blew. I can not think of a worse cartoon ever then Scooby Doo.

Ren and Stimpy will for ever and always have a special place in my heart as the cartoon that turned me on and jump started me into a new world of animation and humor.

A great thing about this set is the interviews, but only half of them are of any real intrest. They are not for the casual fan they were meant for the hard core nerds like me, but even I found a lot of them boring. The animation is great in a few episodes and pretty crappy in a few. The new R&S never had the same magic of the original run of the show on Nickeloden. But is worth checking out for any one instrested in R&S or just intrested in a few laughs. John K, has always given us some great stuff and I keep holding out hope one day for a new SPUMCO site to show up with some more Goddamn George Liqour and Idiot boy cartoons (they were R&S original owners) as well as Sody Pop and Weekend Pussy Hunt.

The storylines, however, are so-so. Some episodes stand out (and are hilarious), yet, without censorship, these shows do go beyond the bounds of poor taste, like Peter Jackson, before he made it big - but bad taste doesn't always make something funny; it's just poor taste and judgment. However, others, while not being retreads, just seem kind of tired. It is a fun novelty to have these characters back, and in jaw-droppingly offensive situations, which is one of the reasons I bought it...but, I would not rate it as exceptional. Sometimes censorship DOES make you more creative. For having waited so long for these new shows - I doubt it's entirely Mr. Kricfalusi's fault - he had to fight for years to get the rights to his OWN character's back - (kudos to him for that, and shame on Nickelodeon), it doesn't have that spark of what all of us fans were clamoring for - maybe it's just b/c we're older, or the expectation after all these years was too high.

For those of you who don't know the history, John K. was fired after the second season for pushing the limits and ruffling the feathers of the network executives... who owned the rights to the show and the characters.  They hired new people, toned down the shows and the quality dropped.

About 3 years ago, Spike picked up the contract and asked him to produce about a dozen or so new shows... some of which were never aired because of the censorship issues raised by the Janet Jackson Superbowl mess.

Anyhow, Spike just released a compilation of about 6 of these little gems and I just watched the first episode and all I can say is WOW!  Ren & Stimpy were groundbreaking in the early 90s, but they were held back by Nickelodeon, the network that originally aired them.

Without giving away too much plot, In one particular episode, Ren & Stimpy spend the day at the beach staring at naked women and they manage to become bathroom attendants who gladly lather up the women in the showers.  Unlike the original shows, which broke ground with simple bathroom and booger jokes.  These shows are completely adult oriented and they make no attempt to target anyone but adults... men specifically.  In fact, in the introduction to the DVD from Weird Al Yankovic, he mentions at least 3 times that his wife HATES these shows.

So be warned, these are NOT the cute little characters you knew 15 years ago.  They've grown up and the jokes have along with them.

So, if you liked the original Ren & Stimpy, you've GOT to see these ""Lost Episodes"".",1153958400,10,1725,4.564935064935065

If you liked the original but your sense of humor has become just slightly more twisted you're sure to enjoy every minute of this dvd collection.

The bonus features also make this dvd set worth the money.  From the introduction to the set from Weird Al and John K. to the interviews, episode intros, storyboards, pencil tests, and animatics this is one dvd no animation lover should go without.",1153958400,4,560,4.365384615384615

After watching all the episodes i was really glad that John K. had went more mature with the show.  We had to rewind so many times because we were laughing for so long we missed alot of jokes!  If you were a fan back in the 90's this is a MUST BUY!  If not its still a good buy.  I mean come on! who didn't watch Ren and Stimpy back in the days of SNICK!",1153872000,3,527,3.7981651376146788

2556408,5,B000F9T700,"Adult Party Cartoon is amazing, plain and simple.

So many people complain about the direction that Spumco went with the new Ren and Stimpy cartoons, and to some extent I can understand why.  But come on, art evolves and I guarantee you that just as many people would be hollering if John and the gang had just kept on doing what they were doing in 1991.  But they didn't, and that's awesome.

Spumco has always been in the business of reinventing amazing cartoons.. right from the get-go.  The original Ren & Stimpy = Brilliant.  The Yogi/Jetsons cartoons = brilliant, and Adult Party Cartoon is also brilliant.  Will it make you uncomfortable? YES!  Is some of the art disgusting and disturbing?  Yes!  And you know what?  That's the nature of art.  Art challenges and entertains and tittilates and disgusts and disturbs, and that's why it's so important to our society.  There's nothing I love more than a complicated piece of work that makes me think, reflect and laugh -- and these do all that in spades.  Some of them are absolutely kill-you-in-the-face-dead-on-FUNNY (Altruists, Naked Beach Frenzy), and some of them are sad, awful/beautiful pieces about the nature of psyche (Ren Seeks Help.)  I don't really know how to classify Firedogs 2, but Ralph Bakshi is one heck of a guy.

Ultimately, it's up to you -- but I think these are brilliant and I tell you what, a single frame from nearly any Spumco cartoon makes me laugh more than the entire running time of an entire episode of Family Guy (funny show, worst art ever.)

Great job, Spumco!

POSTSCRIPT: the packaging is brilliant, a work of art, fantastic.  I wish that much care and attention went into all cartoon dvd packaging.  Heck, all packaging.",1153699200,24,1715,4.7687074829931975
2556409,1,B000F9T700,"Once a month I like to invite friends over and watch Ren and Stimpy. It's became a ritual of sorts as we are all avid fans, and I admit that all 6 of my regular attendees (myself included) were quite excited by the latest batch of Adult themed episodes. None of us bothered to ask why we were excited, it just sounded cool I guess.

Sadly, I have to report that I've never heard these people so quiet while watching a Ren and Stimpy cartoon. Muted and sad may be the best way to describe this group of die hards, as we had just witnessed something that once was so bizarrely eschewed and joyous turn ugly and (worse of all) boring.

This misguided effort is so devoid of the charm of the initial cartoons it seems almost disingenuous to even call it Ren and Stimpy. While a devious spirit always lurked around the Ren and Stimpy universe these ""adult"" episodes strip most of the like-ability out of the characters (particularly Ren), the result being a flood of unimaginative and screamingly unfunny dialogues and scenarios.

While this reviewer is no fan of politically correct comedy these latest Ren and Stimpy episodes are nothing more than reactionary novelty acts which are just as dull witted as the ""PC comedy by comity"" that they claim to be combating.

It makes me wonder, perhaps some things get lost for a reason, and just maybe those editing executives of yesteryear were not quite as clueless as John K makes them out to be?",1153699200,22,1438,4.562015503875969

I love his early Ren & Stimpy work, love his George Liquor, Jimmy the Idiot, and Sody Pop web cartoons, Weekend PussyHunt, etc.  These new R&S cartoons have been so over-hyped and raved about that I was expecting the best damn cartoons available on DVD.  I have to say, they are a bit of a let down.  I agree with the reviewer that said 'Example: the poorly designed and executed ""Hairy Lifeguard"" in the first cartoon ""Naked Beach Frenzy"" overshadowed the otherwise delicious cartoon boob action. All six of the shorts (and not so shorts) on this release have similar good and bad points but there's plenty of room for improvement. I was expecting a better level of craftsmanship and storytelling after all this time.'

The animation is sorta cheap-looking, not nearly as good as Spumco's previous creations.  Sometimes it can be pretty distracting.  Mouths frequently don't match the dialogue, and characters change from frame to frame (Stimpy's shaved belly comes and goes in 'Stimpy's Pregnancy') ....However, there is plenty of good in all the cartoons: off the wall humor, silly dialogue, nods to the classic cartoons and inside jokes.  If you're looking for bouncing bosoms, nipples, boner jokes, and body fluids galore, this is the set for you.  If classic Ren & Stimpy you crave, stick with Seasons 1 & 2.

Hopefully this boxset will generate enough public interest that Mr. K and his brilliant team can up the quality of their future productions.  I'm looking forward to more bits of silliness.",1153699200,2,1615,4.900735294117647

The 'Altruists' episode is a surreallist masterpiece, uncompromised by not being over-analysed by network execs. Gags come from so far leftfield in this one that I'm amazed they actually came from a human brain. The lack of such timeslot limitations do produce a few gross misfires, but the benefits that creative freedom give are stunningly evident in at least 80% of this collection. Timing and performance levels have been kicked up several notches since the originals and I could stare at some of these still frames for eons.

Please don't judge the series based on the episodes that aired on Spike - the unaired cartoons undoubtably feature the highlights of John's career. I'm desperate for more and you will be too once you see this. Don't even hesitate!",1153353600,5,895,4.920529801324503

2556420,5,B000F9T700,"I got up early to buy the ""Lost Episodes"" and this is what my rambling and mostly incoherent mind has to say.

To say that these episodes aren't as good as the original run of the series is a bit of an unfair comparison. It's not really the same show, just the same characters. And besides, these episodes are BETTER than many of the original run.

Unlike some shows that have been called back from cancellation this collection has pushed the Ren and Stimpy franchise even further and let it mature and improve. The jokes are faster paced, more frequent, and much more adult. Now let me clarify when I say `adult'. I don't mean adult in the sense that they are more crass and vulgar (although some do toe the line of shivering grotesquery), I mean that they are smarter and much cleverer and even complex. They are adult in the sense that they aren't designed for children to understand.

Pretty much all cartoons designed for children today rely on dumber and uninspired jokes. Every single joke in these episodes is fresh and nearly all of them work on a level that far surpasses what is considered `funny' these days. Where cartoons nowadays have a stupid character just so they can throw in stupid jokes about how stupid the character is, the stupid jokes in these episodes come from the characters and are written from the character and not for the character (if that makes any sense). In my opinion, most writers, when they see a joke work they would rather copy that joke for a cheap and easy laugh instead of doing what John K. and the many others who worked on these episodes do and that is finding out why the joke works and or just making things because it IS funny and not because it's SUPPOSED TO BE funny.

These are by far the best Cartoons created in the last decade, easy.

I don't know what else to say.

However, the greatest delight the viewer will get from

Turning John K and co. loose and letting them be as naughty as they want to be takes all the Joy out of Ren and Stimpy. The antagonism between the creators and the studio is lost and as a result most of the humor is gone as well.

The animation is stellar though, far cleaner than anything produced in the original run which is why this gets 2 stars instead of 1.

The DVD itself is mastered poorly, fronted with 4 previews for worthless junk I'm not interested in. You can't stop them or menu out of them. You can chapter skip past them, but you must do a chapter skip for each item. Disabling remote options prevents this disc from getting a 3 star review.",1153267200,11,909,4.366863905325443

2556426,5,B000F9T700,"I'm not going to say anything bad about ""Ren and Stimpy - The Lost Episodes"", because what is clearly right about them is so far in excess of any other available modern animated cartoon product, that in this context, what might be considered wrong by some simply does not matter.

I could take argument with specific gags, I could say that timing is poor here and there, I could say the writing doesn't make a lot of literal sense, I could object to certain kinds of strong content, I could say they are not exactly like the episodes from over 10 years ago. That would all be incredibly superficial and short-sighted. ""The Lost Episodes"" far transcend such petty subjective criticisms in so many highly substantial ways, that it would be insipid to dwell on such things. Turn off your yapping-toy-poodle critical factor, if you have one, and simply enjoy the lavish absurdity, over and over again --because unlike almost all other TV cartoon fare ever created, there is a lot to see. You can actually watch these cartoons repeatedly, because there is so much expression, and expressiveness in the drawings, moment-to-moment, frame-by-frame, and wall-to-wall. You won't find any cheating here. Your eyes have never been treated with so much respect, by such a clearly passionate cartoon creator in all your TV life. Any true fan of the medium should be rejoicing at the proof you have long been waiting for, that cartoons made for television don't have to be stiff and lifeless and repetitive because of the economics involved. John K explodes this myth, using only raw talent and drive, and produced these envelope-pushing gems on a shoestring, relative to the budget of a show like The Simpsons, and after seeing his results, we are compelled to ask, ""Where does the money go on those other shows?""

The original Ren and Stimpy series changed the entire future of kiddie cartoons, with almost every show in production since taking some lesson or trying to milk some formula derived from it, and its adult following helped open the door and pave the way for more risqu content in cartoons for grownups. But somehow all of those benefiting and learning from John K's innovation seem to have taken only something superficial from him, and are never willing to explore the same range and depth of visual excitement and experience.

We can only hope that the industry takes note once again, but that the lesson learned this time is of the underlying fundamentals that make John K's work so compelling, and so unlike everything else. Let's hope the industry learns to create characters that are not just funny looking, but that are also versatile and capable performers.

With so many TV cartoons being relatively static and driven by dialogue, it's easy to forget that cartoons are a visual medium --the original eye candy --and ""The Lost Episodes"" joyously reveal that we have all been force fed a cartoon diet of stale, dry white bread for far too long. Real cartoons have finally returned.",1153094400,10,2988,4.864440078585462

Seasons 1-2 had a real charm which is now gone. They definitely pushed the boundaries of taste, but they did it using careful innuendo. The show had limits, and the gross/twisted parts of the show were balanced by an underlying sweetness and innocence. The people making the show pulled off an amazing balancing act which is what made the show great.

In this new version, this is all gone. Instead, the show merely tries to be as disgusting and offensive as can be. The animation and voices are still strong, but they are wasted on this pointless material. My problem is not that I'm morally offended, it's that there's next to nothing left about the show to like.

2556430,5,B000F9T700,"Here we have the long awaited ""Lost Episodes"" of the Ren and Stimpy  show.

In actuality, these are latest episodes produced by the reformed Spumco team. The original team behind the early 1st and 2nd season masterpieces, and in the eyes of many, the saviors of the modern day television broadcast animated cartoon.

In and around the time of 1993, Nickelodeon execs nervous about the edgy, surreal, insane, over-the-top yet subtly acted and beautifully inspired cartoons fired the original animation team, on the eve of their ambitions of The Ren and Stimpy Show becoming even more than what it set out to be. The result was a poor attempt to salvage the reputation while believing the fanbase would be ""none the wiser"". Nothing could be more false, however, as the show suffered greatly under the reigns of the Games production team, who took over the show.

Ren and Stimpy became for 3 more seasons, only a mere, pale shell of the greatness it could achieve.

And then, well after the ""Copycat Ren and Stimpy's"" well deserved demise, something incredible happened. over 10 years after having been fired, Spumco, and creator John Kristaflusi were back at the helm, and determined to make a difference.

The result were new episodes, produced with Adults in mind. No longer for the children, as Ren and Stimpy fans had grown up, and so had the cartoons.

Like a breath of fresh air after suffocation of over 10 years, these new episodes are a pure delight. Several had aired on Spike TV, however, in a case of history repeating itself, a network that briefly prided itself as being ""The First Network For Men"" seemed to have pussied out of their agreement for a more mature, more Adult Ren and Stimpy.

The result: Less than half of the new, groundbreaking season was ever aired on Television.

After one year of waiting for a proper DVD release, the masterpiece collection of Ren and Stimpy episodes will at long last, be available.

These episodes are nothing short of phenomenal. Having myself witnessed nearly half of the episodes during the Spike TV run, and countless special unfinished ""previews"" of the remaining episodes, Ren and Stimpy has never been more creative, more well animated, more technically proficient, more edgy, more skillfully crafted... in short, these works are sheer masterpieces.

Sadly, much like the original run of Ren and Stimpy, there are always those who let their tendency to be very easily offended cloud their judgement of the series and the show as a whole. Especially with these newer episodes, while being flat-out advertised as more adult that the previous series that was constrained for children, there are those that let their own squeamishness cloud their judgement, in order to grasp any flimsy excuse to overlook the finer points, and point out so called ""Negatives"" with the new episodes that are simply not there.

Ignorant and badly reasoned ""reviews"" from the overactive imaginations of those who cannot fathom a natural evolution of The Ren and Stimpy show from it's previous, confined, censored version, to this new masterpiece vision of Ren and Stimpy which allows for creative freedom and limitless possibilities, WITHOUT the limitations in both quality and expression that the original run, unfortunately suffered with.

What you will find with these ""Lost Episodes"" is the vision of what Ren and Stimpy could have ever been. 5 times as creative, and much much more of every single ingredient to it's original success magnified tenfold.

If you are easily offended... if disgusting hilarity, nude bosoms, adult themes, and crude sexual humor is not your thing, and you prefer a watered down, pale, and out of date Ren and Stimpy, this is not it. This is NOT for the weak at heart.

This is Ren and Stimpy to the next level of ""edgy"". Certainly not your little brothers Ren and Stimpy. This is Ren and Stimpy for the grown up fans of today, and it should be regarded as such.

Spumco could have very well have sat back and pumped out episodes full of vulgarities with no story structure, no growth, no experementation and no room to be any better than before. And due to the so-called ""informed"" opinions of naysayers (Most of whom witness a single ""gay"" joke, turned the show off and wrote uninformed, hateful reviews based puerly on a juvinile, knee-jerk reaction) some people have done just that.

Of course, when quailty speaks for itself as these phenominal episodes do, one sees that the show had never been more imaginitve and more techinally nearling perfection as these great episodes have. Way too much for television, and way more advanced than any previous episodes, it still maintains every bit of the ortiginal integrity and quailty that made Ren and Stimpy a success from day one:

That being, the finest artwork and production since the 1940's WB shorts, the belivable, and exciting drama and unpredictable hilarity, and above all, great stories, with unparalled imagination all backed up by some of the most creative names in the buisness of animation all working together on one quailty project.

If you are able to accept the natural direction of R&S in a world of other adult themed shows like South Park, then one will notice the creativity and quality heightened to levels never thought possible. The new episodes are every bit as inventive, shocking, hilarious, and well made using every trick in the old Spumco book and a great deal of brand new ones.

You'll see things never thought possible in Ren and Stimpy. A whole new level of creativity and a Ren and Stimpy show better and more exiting for the REAL fans of the series, not the meek or faint, unable to deal with change for the better.

For anyone that remembers Ren and Stimpy fondly, and would love to check out a new Ren and Stimpy Show which holds all of the limitless possibilities, never even before thought of from the original seasons, this is a must have DVD set. The one that die hard fans have been waiting for, and even suffered through releases of the remarkably generic, poor, and inferior ""Games"" episodes of seasons 3, 4, and 5.

2556431,4,B000F9T700,"Here's my theory on this set:  John K was the original creator of Ren & Stimpy, and when Nickelodeon made him leave, the series took a turn, and Spumco wasn't going to do the show without John.  John K's original episodes always insinuated Ren and Stimpy to be in a relationship, so these Adult Party Cartoon episodes really worked with what John wanted the show to be.

I personally think this set will be great because I enjoy Ren & Stimpy for the earlier jokes that were rude and vulgar, and sometimes contained minor sexual innuendos.  These episodes take those aspects of the show to a whole new level with nudity, sex, and profanity.  Now if you like the later episodes of Ren & Stimpy, when Nickelodeon took over, you will most likely find this show stupid and weird.  It holds some value to the stupidity of Ren and Stimpy, but really emphasizes a whole new look on the characters.  So really, it depends on what kind of fan you are.  If you liked the older episodes more than the newer ones, chances are you will take some enjoyment in these.  I managed to catch a couple episodes on Spike TV, and I really enjoyed them, so I will support John K and Spumco and buy these DVDs.  My only complaint is that Billy West doesn't do the voice of Stimpy, and that's worth losing a star to me.",1148947200,12,1293,4.372384937238493

The only Adult Party Cartoon episode I've seen is ""Ren Seeks Help"", and a few short clips of other episodes on John K's blog.  I can't wait for this set!  Although I've only seen a little of Adult Party Cartoon, there is one thing for sure, it is endlessly better than seasons 3-5 of the original.",1147910400,10,356,4.130434782608695

The Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon sucks big time!
By the way John, have you noticed that the new Hey Arnold Jungle Movie has just been released, and will be followed by the Rocky's Modern Life special Static Clinge that will come out sometime next year, not to mention a Nickelodeon reboot movie of all the other classic 90's Nicktoons, but what about Ren and Stimpy? Oh wait, Paramount never wants a R&S reboot because of this pile of trash. I have read rumors that you were going to produce a Red and Stimpy short for a supposed 3rd SpongeBob movie, but after hearing them false, I can't blame Paramount for such wasted childhood ruining cartoons you made that has made the franchise no longer child-appropriate.",1511740800,,894,4.811688311688312

8119500,1,B000F9T700,"When I first saw this, All I could think was ""Oh my God, more episodes for Ren and Stimpy!"" I thought is was so cool! That is... I then saw the corner. ""Adult Party Cartoon"". I slouched back down, disappointed. First off, I feel the need to point out that BIlly West, the voices of both Ren AND Stimpy, refused to be in this cartoon because he thought it was too gross and vile. I repeat: The VOICE ACTOR for REN AND STIMPY refused to be in this because he said IT'S TOO GROSS AND VILE. I think the only episode in the original series that wasn't even remotely gross or vile was Stimpy's Big Day, WHICH WAS THE PILOT! Everyone only mentions Ren Seeks Help, and for good reason. But it gets worse. dressing stimpy in drag, showering with naked women, babies made out of nothing but Stimpy's crap, and that's all I could stand. I could only watch Ren Seeks Help, Stimpy's Pregnant, Naked Beach Frenzy, and HALF of Fire Dogs 2. I was going in to Fire Dogs 2 excited. More of Fire Dogs? I LOVE THAT EPISODE! But got, I'm dissapointed. I couldn't watch the rest, and that's for the better. I tried to burn it form my mind, but it won't go away. I won't even go into the commentaries, John K's clips, or anything like that. I don't want to understand what they were thinking when they wrote this. And there's one special feature that I avoid like the plague: The original, uncut version of Ren Seeks Help. Because if they let the episode air like it did, I don't want to see what they wouldn't let air! Not only that, But Ren Seeks Help almost make me lose my love of the show, and I couldn't watch it for half a year! Please, don't watch this sequel. Not for you, not for John K, but for everyone.",1500249600,,1692,4.2253086419753085
