8687765,3,B00PGA44K6,This was ok.  I*t was hard to try to read the subtitles and see the scene.  I didn't finish this.,1464048000,,97,3.8
8687766,4,B00PGA44K6,"We really enjoyed this movie.  The scenery is incredible and the interviewees give a wonderful window into a culture that was totally new to me.  I am interested in whole food and traditional means of food preparation, so it was nice to see a few examples of how these people produce and prepare their food.  That was not the main thrust of the movie at all but it was fun to see.  A few times it did feel a little bit repetitive and meandering but it had a lot of fascinating information.  The issue of cultural change is relevant all over and this movie does a nice job of presenting the subject matter.  The film shows that this not a simple or new issue, as the ""traditional"" villagers are shown grinding corn and preparing it to eat, and corn of course being native to the Americas, this suggests that cultural change has always occurred.  Definitely worth watching.",1453593600,,871,4.509554140127388

8687768,4,B00PGA44K6,"This is a fascinating portrayal of a particular subculture in Turkey, with influences from Armenian, Kurdish, and other peoples. It is not narrated, but lets the people who live there speak for themselves (prompted, I'm sure). Subtitled in English (over Turkish and possibly other languages / dialects).

To me, more compelling than this culture are the larger topics the movie addresses, or at least talks around. Does any culture really stay static for countless generations, or is there always change over the decades? If change is inevitable, how much should people try to preserve the old ways? What can be preserved, in the face of economic, technological, and other pressures? Can a dance form that held a village together a century ago play that same role now? If not, what meaning is there in preserving it?

In addition to sparking, if not answering, these sorts of questions, the movie has a lot to recommend it. The interviewees are quite articulate, the scenery is stunning, and the movie preserves bits of a culture which is already faded.

I had some problems with the movie. Many of the people talk so quickly that keeping up with the subtitles is a task, especially if you want to take in the visuals. I could have had more scenic shots and less time watching talking heads.

My main complaint is there is a certain lack of story or even structure. By the end, the viewer may have some idea of the history of the area, and how new farming ideas, population shifts, and other influences changed the culture. I would have preferred the film lay this out in a more complete and straight-forward fashion. There are no maps, no statistics, no dates ... just a bunch of anecdotes. It is, after all, a documentary, but I found after watching it that I had a hard time articulating the subject matter.

I also felt the film could have been shorter, more focused. I empathize that they must have had a ton of great footage and wanted to share as much as they could. But there was repetition. Further, while everything was about the culture, not all of it was about dance - nominally, the point of the movie. Plus, at 50 minutes it would have fit into a TV slot or a classroom hour, but at 65 minutes it is harder to utilize.

I would give it three stars, but given that this is (I believe) the only film to capture this culture, and how insightful the interviewees are, I'll do four.",1437264000,,2391,4.60093896713615
8687769,4,B00PGA44K6,"Fast pace subtitles make it difficult to enjoy the gorgeous visuals. Great message, great people, great story. I enjoyed it.",1430006400,,124,5.25
8687770,4,B00PGA44K6,"Nicely done. If you are interested in this region of the world, or in myth and folklore and older ways in general, spend the hour to watch this gently paced look at the people of Turkey's plateau region. I was intrigued by the landscape, the erudition of the bagpipe artists, the information about their animals, the way the Hemshim live day-to-day, and especially by the younger generation who want to keep some traditions going.
I wonder about the images and interviews that were not included; the filmmaker's sympathies are clear. It's not a problem, though, because those of us watching, likely share his point of view. One more thing: I didn't know until the final credits that this was made possible by a Kickstarter - could that be more terrific? All who contributed, thanks.",1426723200,,782,4.843283582089552
8687771,5,B00PGA44K6,"This film manages to cover the fading practice of a cultural dance in Turkey in a way that makes me mourn the loss of my own cultural traditions. I realized that despite the many cultural differences that separate me from Muslims in Turkey, we share a passion for living a relevant and full life. Bravo, Mario. Thanks for discovering this story and making the effort to reveal it to the world.",1420156800,,393,4.549295774647887
8687772,5,B00PGA44K6,"I found this to be an inspiring documentary. A true story of life and evolving cultures. It made me think deeply about the Turkish people and our own country and the evolvement it has, and is going through. Very well presented and filmed. The photography is absolutely fabulous. This film belongs in everyones library.",1417046400,,318,4.907407407407407
