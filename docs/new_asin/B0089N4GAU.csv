5141856,5,B0089N4GAU,"As a life long Met fan, I have been teased with Tom Seaver, Doc Gooden, David Cone, Bobby Jones and RA Dickey pitching 1 hitters some of whom cam e so painfully close to that no-hitter, that we were finally able to get that monkey off our backs.  It's a shame that that game will be the last well pitched game from Johan Santana in a Met uniform.",1366675200,,346,4.088235294117647
5141857,5,B0089N4GAU,"This DVD is just as advertised, but more importantly it's an uncommon highlight in a string of seasons lacking them.",1356825600,,116,4.85
5141858,1,B0089N4GAU,"To start the sixth, Carlos Beltran, in his first game at Citi Field since leaving the Mets last year, scorched a shot down the line. A replay showed Beltran hit the white chalk on the third-base line. Umpire Adrian Johnson ruled it a foul ball and Beltran ended up grounding out.

""I saw the ball hitting outside the line, just foul,"" Johnson said to a pool reporter after the game.

Johnson said he saw the replay, but upon further review, declined to comment if he thought the ball was fair or foul.

So in reality  it was a one hitter.

The chalk clearly flew up in the air. Johnson blew the call. There's nothing bitter or hating when stating the facts except from rude New Yorkers.",1356825600,4,686,4.412698412698413
5141859,4,B0089N4GAU,"For $5 bucks on black Friday I could not go wrong with this. A great game in Mets history. Since I had seen only the last three inings, this let me see what I missed earlier in the game.",1356480000,,186,3.7948717948717947
5141860,5,B0089N4GAU,"This DVD contains a broadcast of Johan Santana's no hitter for the Mets. The DVD and content are straight forward of this historical performance. As a New York sports fan, any piece of New York sports history is a cool add on to my collection. I you are a baseball fan I would recommend this.",1355443200,,292,4.327272727272727
5141861,5,B0089N4GAU,"On a Friday night, June 1, 2012, I headed out to Citi Field for two reasons:  (1) to watch Johan Santana ""do his thing"" as I love watching him pitch; and (2) to boo Carlos Beltran upon his first appearance since being traded from the Mets.  It had threatened rain, so I didn't buy my ticket until I got to the ballpark.  No one wanted to go with me; no problem, I've been to ballgames by myself before.  Johan wasn't at his sharpest, but he was sharp enough.  A ball hit by Carlos Beltran tapped the third-base line, a hit according to the rules, but at least on this night Lady Luck was shining upon us and the umpire called the ball foul.  In the seventh inning a ball was hit to deep left field and Mike Baxter, the Mets left fielder who grew up in Queens as a Mets fan, crashed into the wall, catching the ball and preserving the no-hitter. It must be said that Johan Santana was on the disabled list for all of 2011, having had surgery for a torn shoulder capsule after the 2010 season, and no other athlete has ever come back from this surgery.  His pitch count was being monitored and as the innings went on, Mets fans were unsure if Manager Terry Collins would permit Santana to finish the game.  It took 134 pitches, but Johan Santana pitched the Mets first no-hitter, walking five batters.  Citi Field went crazy as Johan dedicated the game to the fans, knowing we waited over 8,000 games for our first no-no -- and against the former World Champs, at that!  He brought us what Tom Seaver, Dwight Gooden, and all the great Met pitchers before him, couldn't.  For that, Johan Santana will always be revered to Mets fans. And I was there, with tears of joy streaming down my face.  It doesn't get much better than that!

Watching the DVD brought it all back.  What an awesome game and experience as a Mets fan.  It's no wonder the song ""Smooth"" by Santana is played whenever Johan takes the mound at Citi Field.  On June 1, 2012, he was indeed smooth!",1354838400,,1959,4.34065934065934
5141862,5,B0089N4GAU,"As Mets fans my husband and I have a tradition of waiting to see the first hit against the Mets in every game before jokingly remarking ""well there goes the no hitter."" Its a running joke through the family and others fans who just understood that it wasn't meant to be and often times would be followed by lamenting about how it would never happen. But this night was something special. Earlier in the season watching RA Dickey throw back to back one hitters you had to wonder if this was the season that maybe, just maybe, the Mets would finally get to scratch this milestone of its long held chart. But that first night in June gave us a show we will never forget. I remember sitting there on the couch biting my nails as my two toddlers roamed the living room, my husband not moving from his spot on the floor because baseball superstition even reaches to the fans. There was a magic that night that was captured on this DVD and now owning it I can be transported back there.  Back to watching a pitcher who had given so much to this team for it to collapse under him so many times, one who had suffered a major surgery and missed so many games, one who I remember nervously watching the trade deadline for and celebrating his arrival on the team finally get his due. He struggled through a outrageously high pitch count and watching Mike Baxter sacrifice his body to save the bid but he never once faltered in his determination and with the final out you could see the relief and joy, Citi field was rocking that night and now thanks to this DVD it will be any time I want it to be! The one thing I wish was that it would have including the post game interviews and more of the celebration. Other than that this is a must have for any Mets fan.",1353110400,5,1749,4.283987915407855
5141863,5,B0089N4GAU,"If a DVD were to be released of every no-hitter, there would be too many to collect. This year alone, fans have witnessed five no-no's (including two perfect games). But there are some no-hitters that stand above the others as special, that deserve DVD treatment. Johan Santana`s effort against the St. Louis Cardinals earlier this year proved to be one of those special moments as it was the first no-hitter thrown in the history of the New York Mets franchise.

The Mets have been around for more than a half century and several high-profile pitchers have appeared in their blue and orange uniform, such as Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, Dwight Gooden. Thirty-five times in the team's first 8019 games a Mets pitcher has thrown a one-hitter, but Santana was the first to blank the opposition in the hits column for a full nine innings on June 1, 2012, at Citi Field in Flushing, NY.

One of the most exciting plays in the game came in the seventh inning when Yadier Molina launched a ball deep into the outfield. Left fielder Mike Baxter chased it down to make the catch, but was injured when he ran into the wall at full speed; he has not played in a big league game since.

After falling behind in the count 3-0 in the top of the ninth inning, Santana proceeded to strike out David Freese swinging to secure the first no-hitter in team history. The DVD included the post-game interview conducted on the field, complete with the whipped cream pie-in-the-face. As an alternative to the television broadcast, viewers can listen to the radio play-by-play in either English or Spanish while watching the game.

There is no doubt that this is a special game, not only from Mets fans, but for baseball fans in general. To own it on DVD is a no-brainer.",1345075200,6,1742,4.627831715210356
5141864,5,B0089N4GAU,"This is a must have for any Met fan young or old. The Met fan is a special breed. Met fans have yearned for a no-hitter since the teams formation in 1962. It grew and became more and more yearned as years went on. Generations of Met fans can watch this and bond as they discuss all the one hitters, how many times no-no's were taken into the ninth and all of the Met history. Just watching the replays of the ninth inning will give a Met fan goose bumps. A Must own and will forever be a part of my collection. I'll buy the blu-ray when that comes out too!!",1339977600,10,557,4.027027027027027

Yes it wasn't an actual no hitter (based on the Beltran hit called a foul), but for us long suffereing Mets fans, well take it.

A must buy for any true Mets fan.",1400544000,,238,4.0212765957446805

I just love this product because it is a memory of the first no-hitter in NY Mets history!
