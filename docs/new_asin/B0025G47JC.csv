8630549,4,B0025G47JC,"Benidorm is in fact a place on the Costa Brava (Mainland Spain) Frequented many years by the Brits. Benidorm (the place) is notorious for it's loud and obnoxious English & Irish bars, Littered with the typical tacky tourist, equivilant of Trailo Trash.
Benidorm comedy series is based around several families from Great Britain who spend every holiday in Benidorm, and never really travel anywhere else. Benidorm sterotypes typical trashy families dealing with tanorexia, drinking problems and sex.
If you love the new British comedies, and are able to understand English accents that are not typical Queens dialect then this is a must.
Crude, lewd and a little rude Benidorm is ""Laugh out loud"", and has taken the UK by storm.",1258070400,2,727,5.066666666666666
