8710979,4,B00VQRFDVW,This is my cup of tea.  A western from the best era of the genre when every week new westerns seemed to be in production. In nice color starring Keith Larsen . A good B western.,1439078400,,177,3.9166666666666665
8710980,4,B00VQRFDVW,"Although not one of the great classics, it is a very good movie I first saw years ago on television.  I was excited to see it on DVD",1435968000,,132,3.7142857142857144
8710981,5,B00VQRFDVW,"Another one of my all time favorites, I enjoyed Keith Larsen as a desperado always 2 steps ahead of the bad guys. Myron Healy is also one of my favorite character actors. The western has a mystery element in it and even though the print has a faded color aspect (I have a vhs recording where the color is too vivid) it is very watchable for me! So glad that this selection is now among the others ( POWDER RIVER. SILVER CITY, FROM HELL TO TEXAS, DAWN AT SOCORRO) Now I am waiting for GUNSMOKE with Audie Murphy.",1433462400,2,511,4.224489795918367
8710982,4,B00VQRFDVW,"I am a bit surprised that I should be the first to write a review of this Warner Archive release. I am also a bit surprised that WA should consider it worth releasing as it is only an average ""B"" Allied Artists film from 1953 in rather dodgy Cinecolour. That does not mean that die hard western fans like me won't enjoy it (4 stars from me). Director Frank McDonald does all that he can with the script and budget and is ably helped by a good cast - Myron Healey, Regis Toomey Lane Bradford, Mike Ragan, James Seay, Stan Jolley and of course, the yet to come into her prime, Peggie Castle. Plenty of chases, gunfights, fist fights and a bit of sexy (for it's time) romance with Larson (not at his best) and Dona Drake. So it is nothing special, but long unseen, in the U/K anyway, and I recomend it to (diehard) western fans. Good clear picture and sound, 4.3 ratio, colour OK.",1433116800,5,877,4.289156626506024
