8461525,2,B0058FYA0S,"Yes, the DVD is a Mexican release of a French film.  Yet I still expected there to be English subtitles or English dubbing available, considering that Jennifer Drake's (an American actress) name appears (erroneously) on this listing, making one presume that there was an English translation and how the listing as Region 1 describes it as compatible for U.S. & Canada only.  Image/video itself looks good, but now I'll have to re-buy this at a higher price to get what I want regarding audio.",1410307200,7,492,4.845238095238095
