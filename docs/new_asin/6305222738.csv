992184,4,6305222738,"Joan Fontaine, in her first Technicolor movie, was never more beautifully costumed and made up as a lady longing for romance with a dashing pirate to escape her dull marriage--but she never quite convinces she has all the spirit and fire of the heroine. She poses prettily in a number of extravagant costumes but her tongue-in-cheek performance makes the fantasy escapism of the story seems artificial and contrived.

Aside from the gorgeous Technicolor, a nice asset is the Victor Young  background score featuring Debussy's 'Clair de Lune' and a properly wicked performance from Basil Rathbone, who gets his comeuppance from the fair lady by having a suit of armor tossed at him.

Cecil Kellaway and Nigel Bruce don't fare as well in rather thankless roles which only succeeds in making them look foolish. And unfortunately, no Frenchman was available to play the pirate, so the studio chose a handsome Spaniard, Arturo de Cordova, who plays the reckless pirate with a distinct lack of charisma.

Women who like fantasies about strong-willed ladies longing for a lusty love affair away from their dull husbands, will appreciate the idea behind the story Daphne DuMaurier provides. It seems to be saying, escape with the man of your dreams if only for a day or night of pirate adventure.

Nothing deep here, but it's beautiful to look at and justly won an Oscar for Best Color Art Direction and Interior Decoration. For fans of costumed romantic fiction, this one fills the bill.

The artificial streak that ran through Joan Fontaine's acting at this point in time, is never more evident than it is when she is being coy and flirtatious. A spitfire like Maureen O'Hara would have been much more suitable as the vivacious and feisty heroine.

But the film's biggest drawback is Arturo de Cordova, the Spanish actor who never manages to be a convincing Frenchman.",1187222400,3,1862,4.948717948717949
992185,4,6305222738,"Based on the Daphne DuMaurier novel, this rapturous adventure is unapologetically female in its viewpoint. Joan Fontaine plays an English noblewoman neglected by her foolish husband, and stalked by a decadent, womanizing lord (the great Basil Rathbone, at his most silky and depraved). Fleeing to her county home in Cornwall, she finds French pirate Arturo De Cordova operating out of a secluded creek on her property-causing an uproar among her neighbors. She tries to stick up for the moral principles of her class, but finds herself so attracted to the philosophical Frenchman and the freedom of his outlaw lifestyle, that she protects him, even joining in his illicit adventures.

The idea of skullduggery as foreplay as a woman and an outlaw earn each others' love is a powerful one, however watered-down by the film's moralistic finale (very different from DuMaurier's free-spirited book). More than any other movie, this is the one that made me want to write my own pirate novel, ""The Witch From The Sea,"" from a woman's perspective.",1110153600,15,1040,5.117647058823529
992186,5,6305222738,"This film is a rare treat, a feast for the eyes. The colors and

photography are breathtaking (truly deserving of an oscar).

The story is a lovely mix of romance, grace and spicy adventure.

The beautiful English noblewoman, Dona St. Columb, and her soul-mate, the handsome French pirate, Jean Benoit Aubery, are per-

fectly portrayed by Joan Fontaine and Arturo de Cordova, and so is the very believable development of their love. I would have

liked another scene by the creek (fishing, perhaps, bird-

watching,or ""exploring""), since this creek was their sanctuary,

their haven and symbol of escape from an artificial and shallow world and thus the springwell of the bond between them.

The supporting roles were beautifully cast and played, notably

the faithful William by Cecil Kellaway and treacherous Lord

Rockingham by Basil Rathbone.",1091836800,12,847,5.207407407407407
992187,5,6305222738,"It puts Barbara Cartland to shame as a competing great romance.  I love how the criminal pirate is so noble, trustworthy, dashing, and handsome.  Why would any woman want the rich, law abiding and as such, pathetically dull husband when she could have that?  The horror and anguish of it all.

I think what I loved most about this movie was the idea of being able to escape from the mundane predictability and responsibilities of daily life, into a world of adventure with a dashing lover as Joan Fontaine does.

I've always loved the novel this movie is based on, and feel it captures the essence of the book.  Joan Fontiane and Arturo de Cordova did an excellent portrayal of the characters, the Lady Dona and the Frenchman, Basil Rathbone is always excellent as the villain and his portrayal of ""Rock"" is true to form.",1459123200,5,604,4.616822429906542

My disc was either damaged or the result of an old film transfer.  However, it did not prevent me from a film I had seen in my childhood.",1429920000,,302,4.339285714285714
992448,5,6305222738,"It was said, so they say,  in the 1940's that Ingrid Bergman got all of the good acting roles, but that Joan Fontaine had no reason to complain.
I am at a loss for words, and it is no secret that I adore Ms. Fontaine.  I will try, but I must break it down to a couple of segments or four.
I was unprepared for the color, and the visual effects.  Fontaine was so  photogenic.  Hitchcock did her plain and glamorous.  But I am not sure Hitchcock made her.  I believe she is wonderfully childish in ''the Women''.  I would like to believe that the lady made it to stardom by her talent.

For such a long time Frenchman's Creek wasn't  available.  Miss Fontaine was never so lovely.  The color is as glowing  as a da Vinci portrait does.  Fontaines  color is magnificent.  The colors of her skin appear as golden through to violet, and the star moves as if she were aware of the impression given.  The colors are subtle and strong when needed.  Who could conceive of or create a film like this one today?  Describing colors with words leaves one feeling useless.  The clothes are up for the ''show'', funny how one forgets them.  At the beginning of the film and towards the end of the film, or is it the color and the excess of flowing fabric.  Yes.

The film itself tells a  story of ,,,,, what if I could run away from it all?  I felt like a boy again and I had such bittersweet fun here.  I am far away from a boy, and, back then, I often lived in my imagination.  For a while watching this film, I was a boy again: and a strange feeling of flying.  And I could be anything.  These are certainly the thoughts of a child.  Fontaine is so believable as she breathes and enjoys some dangerous things.  I will not reveal the end of the film.

Something about Fontaine and de Havilland.  Sisters.  Olivia de Havilland is still living as far as I know.  Olivia started the show and Fontaine won the first Oscar and, they were never united again.  Olivia ended up with two Oscars, and how silly.  Well the ladies were very different on the screen.  Olivia seemed to plunk along with the big eye's.  Joan floated along in to the camera range.  Lovely photographic bones.  Joan in black or white/color always had a glorious haze around her face.  As the years rolled by, Joan made, ''Letter from an unknown woman''1948.  This film is my favorite Fontaine film.

In through the 1950's Fontaine made films and then suddenly stopped.  I am sure she changed her mind about what she was doing with her life.  ''Tender is the Night'', seemed to be the last of the big movies.  Her look had changed, she stole the film, it was said.  I always write my head off and have to edit/edit.

This is a film  one has to see and experience.  And it is an experience on a big screen tv, all that worked out, the sound is ''important'' and the color has been as stated lovingly alive.  Women then did not need gigantic breasts.  The clothes show off Fontaine in a way that reminds of the color of a sweet peach.  I have left so much for the viewer to find.",1428624000,8,3029,4.276595744680851
992449,5,6305222738,"I know not why but this movie has always been a favorite of mine. I am not particularly a Joan Fontaine fan but the sets and costumes, especially the periwigs, are exceptional. This is in the same camp with Forever Amber for me. I have no idea why but Linda Darnell can really do it for a guy and that is from the grave so she had to be incredible.

992570,5,6305222738,"This is a guilty pleasure.  It is probably the silliest movie I own.  The plot is ridiculous and the ending is a bit trite.  But its such fun, and so beautiful to look at.  Gorgeous scenery, gorgeous houses, and a gorgeous cast.  I have a weakness for well-done historical costume stories.  Its from a book by Daphne du Maurier, better known for Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel.

The cast is marvelous.  Joan Fontaine plays Dona, a wealthy woman in Restoration England.  Her husband, played by Ralph Forbes, is a dolt, utterly clueless.  He seems to hero worship his friend, Lord Rockingham, played by Basil Rathbone at his slimiest.  Rockingham has no scruples and is eager to conquer and seduce his best friends wife.  They live a frivolous life, but one night Dona has her fill of the lecherous Rockingham and her marriage.  She takes her small children and runs off to their seldom-visited, ancient estate in Cornwall.  There she finds a strange caretaker, a man shes never met, played by Cecil Kellaway.  She finds someone else has been staying in her bedroom, a French pirate, played by the Hispanic actor Arturo de Cordova, and Kellaway is his servant, not hers.  De Cordova is gorgeous, sexy, exciting, cultured, artistic, charming, attentive, considerate . . . well, you get the idea.

Forget reality and enjoy, enjoy.

By the way, if you do like this movie, my other guilty pleasure, also starring Joan Fontaine (as the worlds dumbest doormat), is Letter from an Unknown Woman.",1418601600,3,1484,4.821428571428571

992641,3,6305222738,"In mid 17th century England, fed up with her husband's (Ralph Forbes) antics and the unwanted attention of his lecherous friend (Basil Rathbone), a married noblewoman (Joan Fontaine) leaves him and with her two children goes to the Cornish coast. There she falls under the spell of a French pirate (Arturo De Cordova). Four years after her breakthrough role in the film version of Daphne Du Maurier's REBECCA, Fontaine takes on a different Du Maurier heroine. Feisty, adventurous and loving unwisely. Despite the pirates, the film is not so much a swashbuckler as what they used to call a ""bodice ripper"", a titillating Harlequin like romance. Curiously, the film seems to think nothing of Fontaine ignoring her two children as she risks her life and goes on a thrill raid with the pirates for a few days. Fontaine looks gorgeous in three strip Technicolor and her Raoul Pene Du Bois period costumes but it's a pity she didn't have a more charismatic leading man. There was a brief attempt to make the rather bland Mexican actor a star in Hollywood in the 1940s but the public wasn't biting. directed by Mitchell Leisen. The Oscar winning art direction is courtesy of Hans Dreier and Ernst Fegte and the score by Victor Young. With Nigel Bruce and Cecil Kellaway, not an Irish imp but a French manservant here.

The Universal DVD from Spain is problematic. It's an adequate transfer, nothing more. But the film's gorgeous three strip Technicolor is somewhat faded and the transfer on the soft side.",1317859200,4,1498,4.8515625

But boy, Arturo de Cordova had approximately zero charisma, and the movie never takes off. Even the battle between the heroine and Basil Rathbone feels undercooked.",1465603200,,313,4.9245283018867925
