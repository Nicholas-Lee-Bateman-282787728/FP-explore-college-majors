8542263,5,B009JPW8MK,"I am quite the fan of Duck Dynasty, so when I found out there were similar episodes out there--of course I had to have them. I actually like this better than Duck Dynasty, because it seems less focused on scripted jokes and more focused on what they actually like to do for a living. I find Willy far less annoying in these dvds as well. As the person above mentioned, go to their website! I got both seasons for six dollars less than is trying to be sold here--including shipping! Thanks for the head's up on that, person who reviewed this before me!",1408665600,,551,4.359223300970874
8542264,5,B009JPW8MK,"This series ran a while back on the Outdoor Channel, and is where the zombies at A&E got their idea for Duck Dynasty.  If you're into seeing Si dress up in feather boas, or catching the hijinks of the guys at the local coffee shop, this is probably not the set for you.  This does not have made up situations created by some tie wearin' noodnik.  Don't get me wrong, Duck Dynasty is a weekly must in my household.  A school full of kids getting a healthy dose of Phil-osophy and Si-cology, is a stop everything and watch every time episode.  As it has progressed, though, at times it does feel that some of the antics are forced and phony. This series is more focused on what they actually do out in the blinds. A greater emphasis on duck hunting, still family friendly, but a lot of dead ducks.  There are still glimpses of home, family, and business life, with a good deal of humor.  But I feel that this series seems truer to who these guys are.  Mostly involving Phil and Jase, a heap of Si and Godwin for the funny, not so much Willie doing his best Boss Hogg imitation.  Fans of DD but not so much hunting & guns, may not care for this.  Fans who like seeing a bunch of southern boys doing what they love, and having laughs that are not contrived in a board room, should jump on this set.  Go to the Commander directly, though. You can get season 1 & 2 for cheaper (with shipping costs) than whoever is selling season 1 here for $55.",1390089600,4,1439,4.2344322344322345
