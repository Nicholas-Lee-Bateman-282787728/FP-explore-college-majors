There is such splendid scenery with the meadows and lake behind a very green pasture and up close with the cows.  It has a good story with some nice surprises. I can only imagine the logistics of filming a cow giving birth.  I suppose the big straw piles were to thin out the lush pasture for those dry cows and also use in the birthing stalls.  I was happy to find a film that had the Czech subtitles as I am just beginning to study the language.  My region-free dvd player played it just fine.",1485043200,,673,4.21875
