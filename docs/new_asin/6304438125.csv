884846,5,6304438125,"Beauty and the Beasts is a must have for any nature enthusiasts collection. The Leopard is one of my most favorite big cats, I like the solitary lifestyle that the Leopard lives. I also like the unique coloration of the Leopards fur pattern. This movie is about a Leopard cub that grows up with his mother, and then becomes an adult that fends for himself. This documentary has very good footage as well.

Beauty and the Beasts is about a wart hog family, that grows up in the nearby vicinity, along sides the Leopard family that never cross paths until one night. The wart hog mother sends a rejection notice, to her grown piglets in the middle of the night, to go out into the world to fend for themselves, and they must find shelter in the African night, to avoid all kinds of hungry predators.

And that's where the Beauty encounters the Beast, the wart hog squeals like a rat caught in a rat trap, when the Leopard first attacks the wart hog to eat it. Along comes a young Hyena to compete, and fight with the Leopard for the right to eat the wart hog. The narration is excellently done by the departed James Coburn, star of the 1960's movies; Are Man Flint, and In like Flint. This documentary can be found on VHS, and DVD, but not on Blue-ray, but can be up-converted to look even better if put it into your Blue-ray player. I purchased this movie on VHS, before Blue-ray became a reality, and was some-what satisfied then. Now it can look even better with higher definition through up-conversion. Even I'm in the market to repurchase this documentary on DVD, VHS is not the way to go today.",1314835200,,1598,4.450511945392491

Truly a beautiful female Leopard story everyone will enjoy it.",1137456000,,357,4.25
884848,5,6304438125,"This is an excellent wildlife documentary, which offers great footage and great story about two different neighbors of South African bush, a leopard and a warthog. We see a leopard cub growing up in a difficult environment with many challenges to a young carnivore. Different challenges are imposed on a brood of young warthogs, which proves to be survivors in a dangerous place. The documentary is full of exceptional footage, which portrays every-day drama facing young leopard and warthogs. We see leopards being harassed by lions and hyenas, warthogs escaping predators and surviving the flood in their burrow. There are great moments and thrill of a leopard hunt, unique footage of lions climbing trees in the effort to get leopard's kill as well as a great escape footage of a warthog. Many episodes are shot at night, an active time for leopards. The drama of predator and prey envelops right in front of our eyes. The leopards are portrayed not only as predators but also as prey to lions and hyenas. The warthogs are portrayed as tough survivors in this harsh place. Great documentary!",977788800,8,1094,4.951086956521739
884849,5,6304438125,This was an excellent movie. You become very involved with the lives of the family of leopards and the family of warthogs. This is a very exciting video but not for the faint of heart!  If you love African wildlife this is a must see!  I only wish I saw action like this while I was at Mala Mala reserve.  It must have taken them round the clock vigils to capture this enthralling footage!  I give it 2 paws up!,973296000,3,411,4.1

Ever seen two male lions attack, kill, and eat a maimed, full-grown lioness?  It's here too.  Ever seen warthogs start  munching on a dead wildebeest?  Also here.  This is Africa ""in the  raw.""

7872147,5,6304438125,"I have loved this magnificent film since the first time I saw it, so many years ago I don't remember when it was.  I had the DVD box set but this is one of those films that benefit from the higher definition of Blu-Ray, and especially, with a film this long, the benefit of the data not having to be compressed to fit on a Blu-Ray disk the way it had to be for the DVD.

This great film stands as a uniquely beautiful monument in movie history.",1498435200,3,444,4.034090909090909

7872151,5,6304438125,"I finally saw The Leopard Uncut 185 minutes Hd remastered version last night. It was good as other people said. But for me, I didn't cried or didn't touched to the core. But I had to admit that it was a masterpiece.
The story was centered to the Prince of Salina and through out the film I felt how graceful and dedicated to his country he is.
There are a lot of unforgettable moments in this movie.
The scenes that I do remember right now is the ballroom scene. When Prince's nephew brought his fiance and the fiance asks the price to have the pleasure having a dance with him. The dance was a beautiful moment. Graceful, beauty it was. It is not a surprise that all the people there couldn't even clap their hands. They were just astonished by the prince.
Right after the scene the prince goes out and he walks a little, then he bands his knees as if to pray to god, or as if him talking to the stars. Thas is a beautiful conversation. He was a graceful man. A true prince, a novel deed.
The movie is 185 minutes of you are watching the uncut version. But it was never too heavy or too long.
Each scenes are beautiful and nicely shot. There are not much camera movement or technique or anything but the mis-en-scene itself was just perfect itself. No one can touch at all.
There are a lot of great movies out there but this movie is, I think, the only one that is fulfilled by one actor only. There are of course other actors involeved like the nephew and the nephew's fiance and others but it is the Prince and the Price only who was the true one that was the beauty in this film who shined like a diamond. So shined that made my eyes blind.
I have to watch this film at least 10 times to really make it mine so I won't write much this time.
But it is definately worth watching the unrated director's cut which is 185 minutes.",1456012800,7,1829,4.198863636363637

7872154,5,6304438125,"This was more the story of a love affair and a marriage, in fact a much wider story, both psychologically and politically, I love Burt Lancaster in the role of the Prince and Visconti's vision of the Sicilian life in its opulence, colours and his attention to detail. I particularly enjoyed the 45 minute long ballroom scene. Visconti managed to combined history and realism revolving around the different character types. Visconti's representation of the Risorgimento is very vivid and meaningful.",1410825600,3,498,5.2375

7872156,2,6304438125,"The good, or even great footage is blatantly spoiled by one of the most  cheesy narrations and music scores to ever disgrace an otherwise serious nature documentary.
The narrator speaks as if the target audience was a bunch of 3-year old girls in pink barbie dresses, and combined with the extremely over-the-top touchyfeel  ""Disney"" like music mean they shove down your throat how to interpret virtually every scene, to the point it gets patronizing. Say, when one of the Leopard cubs is found killed it's obviously sad to the viewer who's followed it from birth. But to the narrator and the ""gaggigoohgaa"" music that ain't obvious, so they inundate the scene with not half subtle but blatantly sentimental music (it dominates), just as if  it was an animated Disney film.

Another point about the voice narration. The voice can apparently read the animals minds, describing what they 'think' or 'want' , even when there could be other plausible interpretations, as if just to make it 'cute' (which is an insult given the reality of the footage). It's like the script read what the author wanted things to be rather than what they were, at times. It is  not like when some experienced nature film narrator, such as David Attenborrough, describe an animal's intention based on actual research. In this documentary, it's as if they try to make everything seem either  very cute or very sad whether it is or isn't, or isn't or is. In other words they shove their often  subjective interpretations down the viewer's throat, and do so blatantly, leaving virtually nothing for the imagination or the viewer's own intellect. But the actual footage is not Disneyland. The rough lives and the deaths of the animals  are real and sometimes tragic, which makes the music and narration not just annoying but inappropriate.

The footage itself is good, but how good it is is hard to tell with such distractions.

As an example.  When the Leopard mom looks for one of its cubs and then finds it killed by lions, the music gets so loud and sentimental as if to say ""AWWW THIS IS SAAAAD!!!"" even though the situation is OBVIOUSLY not comical to the viewer already.  The narrator should really stick to Hollywood and leave nature film narration for the experienced. The score writer obviously has some issues with a regressive childhood syndrome.

I must subtract 3 stars from an otherwise  4 or 5 star documentary to their disruptive effects.",1351728000,,2427,4.859223300970874
