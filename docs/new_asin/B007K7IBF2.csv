5092822,5,B007K7IBF2,This book is an excellent adjunct in reading the Inspector Morse novels.  It allows you to know Oxford and greatly enhances the reading experience.  I feel as if I could easily find my way about Oxford shoud I ever visit.,1350518400,2,221,4.5
5092823,5,B007K7IBF2,This is a must to round out a collection of the Inspector Morse DVD Collection. It gives a larger picture of how the series was made.,1349049600,6,133,4.153846153846154
5092824,3,B007K7IBF2,"I was disappointed with this CD. I was hoping for more clips with John Thaw in different Morse episodes from his past. It was kind of boring. Half of what was included was OK but other topics were over covered and not really interesting. Needed more variety of topics, people and actual video. I won't watch it twice.",1347753600,2,317,4.482758620689655
5092825,4,B007K7IBF2,"A trip back in time during the Morse era starring Shaun Evans as a young Morse aka John Thaw.  We are treated once again to the artistic abilities of Colin Dexter and his opinions of Oxford, with meticulous direction of the cast, and outstanding photography.  However, we are asked to accept Mr. Evans as a young Morse with his anti-social behavior and love of ale, crosswords, Wagner and vintage cars.  This is difficult for a devoted John Thaw fan for there is little if any physical resemblance  to the Inspector Morse we knew and loved.  Other than that flaw, and it is more than a minor flaw, this Masterpiece Theater production of ""Endeavour"" is watchable, and worth purchasing.  In fact, there is legitimate room for sequels leading up to the beginning of John Thaw's ""Inspector Morse"" series.",1346544000,5,800,4.802919708029197
5092826,5,B007K7IBF2,"I'm not sure if this DVD saved me a few thousand dollars or will make me spend a few thousand dollars going to London.  It made me feel like I was really there, good job.  I think I'll starting saving my money and go...",1344470400,23,219,3.9545454545454546
5092827,5,B007K7IBF2,"Over time, I have acquired two videos about Morse's Oxford.  This newer one [25th Anniversary] is much better than the first one.  More meaningful scenery shots and more interesting interviews.",1343001600,31,193,5.4
5092828,5,B007K7IBF2,I enjoyed the DVD.  It more than met my expectations.  I have enjoyed both the books and the series and it was so nice to just sit back and see Oxford.,1406851200,,151,3.838709677419355
5092829,5,B007K7IBF2,"Strangely enough I really liked this dvd. It's one of those odd documentaries the British put out where you think Monty Python had a hand in the ""serious"" bits. But I really found the interviews with cast and author informative and helpful. I've been debating doing a Morse-Lewis tour when I go to Oxford. I'm still debating that because I got lots of ideas from this.",1405382400,2,368,4.590909090909091

5092831,5,B007K7IBF2,Used the info to plan my visit to Oxford as part of an overall London trip.  It was very useful.,1381536000,,96,3.8
5092832,5,B007K7IBF2,"Inspector Morse is awesome.  We HIGHLY recommend his series to anyone who loves great British Mysteries.  The Oxford tape, was essential in completing the series, as Oxford is every bit as important a character as Morse and Lewis themselves.  Another brilliant series.  Kudos to British Mysteries!",1380672000,4,297,5.391304347826087
5092833,5,B007K7IBF2,"Morse was one of my favorite bbc mystery shows that was on pbs.

To see Oxford through his eyes was a pleasure, since  his cases were mostly there.

I learned more than Oxford on his show because this is a special dvd that now another younger inspector is taking over, but no
one compares to Morse.

Every Morse fan should get this for their collection. Oxford is truly amazing..",1376611200,2,379,4.449275362318841

5092835,1,B007K7IBF2,"I WROTE A PREVIOUS REVIEW. I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN INSPECTOR MORRIS SHOW--IT WAS BACKGROUND ONLY.
MY MISTAKE.

in the area.",1367798400,,138,5.619047619047619
5092837,4,B007K7IBF2,This DVD is excellent if you are a fan of Inspector Morse or Inspector Lewis and like Oxford as a background.  Found it very enjoyable and informative,1361836800,,150,4.555555555555555
5092838,4,B007K7IBF2,I love Inspector Leewis and was wondering about DSI Morse.  Decided to find out and ordered this and love it.  Now my PBS station is running it on TV.  But I like DSI Lewis better.,1356825600,,180,4.085714285714285
5092839,2,B007K7IBF2,"I haven't watched it yet.  I thought  it was a movie not a documentary about the
character.  Should have looked closer at description.",1356566400,,134,4.739130434782608

5092844,5,B007K7IBF2,"This is our all time favorite BBC mystery series.  We are sad that it came to an end.  Even sadder to lose John Thaw.  This is a delightful look at the settings for so many of the shows.  We are continuing forward with Inspector Lewis.

5092845,5,B007K7IBF2,"This is an excellent overview of all the Morse related spots in Oxford. It's also a great tool for planning your trip, if you want to take a Mores themed journey to Oxford. I really enjoyed this series, on film and in print. Highly recommended video for fans of the series.",1354060800,3,273,4.372549019607843
5092846,5,B007K7IBF2,"This is a great dvd to show so much about the character that Morse is.  It gives a good history from the author and other actors that were in the series, which I own the entire set of.  Great addition to that set for sure.",1353628800,,222,3.911111111111111
5092847,4,B007K7IBF2,"Our family loved Morse, and by extension, Lewis, and Colin Dexter.  Viewing the early days, the development, the various others who had a hand in writing, producing and directing the show, was like bringing it back, after these years.  The only sad part was witnessing the ""aging"" of Dexter.  The awareness that he seemed so frail, so aged, made me realize my own age.  A friend once taught at Oxford and when I asked about Morse, he said his son often went to a local pub that was frequented by Dexter.  He said Dexter was like one of the boys, friendly, have his pint, join the talk, and then leave.  Made him, and Morse, by extension, seem real to me.  This friend later sent me the huge obituary for John Thaw that he had found on the front pages of his newspaper. I saved it, though I'd be hard-pressed to locate it today.

I'd also recommend reading the biography of Morse (okay, John Thaw) written by his wife (or widow).  If you enjoyed the Morse series, this DVD will bring some of it back to you.",1350864000,21,1006,4.365591397849462
8518917,5,B007K7IBF2,"I bought this as a gift for someone who is a fan of the Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis television shows.  This is a great idea for someone who loves history, trivia, literature, travel, etc.",1513555200,,195,4.571428571428571
8518918,5,B007K7IBF2,Nice insight.,1492646400,,13,6.0
8518919,2,B007K7IBF2,"I thought I would see more of the actors and how they got their roles and their take on the various mysteries they were there to solve.  This is more like a travelogue than what I expected to see.  Old buildings and, of course, Oxford, which could do with a makeover and not one interview with any of the actors who contributed so much to the series.  It says on the case of the DVD that Kevin Whately was on the disc, but I don't recall seeing him.  But, of course, I am in my seventies and memory is sometimes a problem  Colin Dexter and composer Barrington Pheloung and others were on the disc, but I was more interested in the actors.  I was disappointed.  But, if you like to see the buildings and Oxford, it will be a pleasant disc to purchase.",1444262400,,750,4.2027972027972025

As I plan on spending a few days in Oxford later this year, it was interesting to see the different pubs and colleges of Oxford.",1434240000,,249,4.813953488372093
8518922,2,B007K7IBF2,I would love to buy this but it and other morse dvds don't have any closed caption (CC) or subtitled for the deaf and the hard of hearing (SDH)..I rather wait until all of MORSE DVDs have cc or sdh then I would order these for sure!,1423612800,2,232,3.9574468085106385
