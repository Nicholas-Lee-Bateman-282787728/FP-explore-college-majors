201092,5,1603993266,"I grew up watching this show as a kid and I am so glad that it is finally out. My own children will love it as well, because they have managed to discover Sonic not too long ago.

What I don't understand is why this volume seems to be hard to get. Why does Amazon have plenty of other copies of the other two volumes but this one appears to be a rare one?",1279584000,,355,3.7972972972972974
201093,5,1603993266,"I have owned all the original T.V. shows based around Sonic and I find the adventures of sonic the hedgehog to be the overall best of them all. I know it's childish and silly, but it's fun. I find the other ones overdone or a little too serious. This show is great and this volume is very good compared to vol. 1 and 2.",1278460800,7,319,4.0

7800240,4,1603993266,"This was bought as gift for my son who was thrilled to receive it. I must admit, I'm also a big fan of Sonic.
My only complaint would the the the outrageous price I paid, however, it was something he really wanted for Christmas, so I bought it. I can't put a price on happiness when it comes to my kids. Would recommend this product. Who doesn't love Sonic?",1357862400,,357,4.188405797101449
7800241,5,1603993266,My son loves anything Sonic the Hedgehog. I bought all 3 volumes in this purchase. Good old school cartoons. I like not having to worry about what he is watching when I put this on.,1353024000,2,181,4.2
7800242,5,1603993266,Its sad but its True the final volume of Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is here and that means the Adventures come to an end. I love this show and now that I have all the episodes I can watch them whenever I want and I hope to share these with my own kids some day.,1348099200,2,267,3.7857142857142856

7800244,5,1603993266,"After watching the third, the rating for this series as hit a all time awesomeness! the way that all the comedy and goofy jokes that this volume and like it predecessors, it was awesome, the series had continued with humor. The only thing i saw wrong with this, i don't know if was just mine or if it is the same with everyone else is that the Robotnik Jr. episode had repeated itself, don't know if thats like the company favorite so they threw it in there twice or it was a simple mistake. But with that aside, i give this series overall and this volume and good thumbs up for all the sonic fans.",1334016000,,598,4.208695652173913
7800245,4,1603993266,"I bought all 3 volumes, so I'll be rating them all rather than just vol 3, here.

This is the silly cartoon with Scratch & Grounder. I loved these as a kid, & recently saw an episode on tv, which pushed me into buying these.

The 3rd vol. is a bit expensive, considering you can get both 1 & 2 combined for less than vol 3.

The covers, if you look, are just swaps, which is lazy and funny. So they are in the same poses, but an image flipped here or moved over there, ect.

You get 4 CDS (per-volume) with about 5 episodes each disk. I knocked it down a star, because as DVD extras go, it blows. You don't even get subtitles. All the disks have are, Play All & Episode. The 4th CD you get a bonus, Extra option, which is just some commentary or How to Draw X, Which would be Sonic, vol 1, Tails, vol 2, and Robotnik, vol 3.

Overall, If you like the series, grab these, but don't expect anything huge when it comes to DVD extras.",1319241600,7,930,4.005405405405406
7800246,5,1603993266,THIS SHOW AND OTHERS(exept sonic x) ARE EPIC I HAVE ALL OF THEM but one thing that annoyed me is that it had an episode from volume 2 but other then that EPIC,1301097600,,158,3.8181818181818183
7800247,5,1603993266,As a person being 21 years old I had seen this show years ago. This is great cartoon to watch when you're bored or just like random silliness. I was shocked to see that this show is finally out on dvd now. I own the first 2 volumes of this show and now I finally have volume 3 I now own the entire series. Great dvd sets to buy and definitely worth the $$$.,1287532800,5,357,3.8378378378378377
