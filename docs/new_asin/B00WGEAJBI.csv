7132131,5,B00WGEAJBI,"This is an absolutely marvelous piece seen live. A true masterpiece. (Of course I'm not the first to call it that.) The video production serves it well, and that's no easy feat. There's a good blend of tight and long shots, without sacrificing too much of the enjoyment one gets from the live performance. I found myself wishing for higher definition (not that this is bad), but I suspect that the stage lighting would probably have to be compromised in order to accomplish that, which wouldn't be a desirable trade-off.",1438646400,,520,4.788888888888889
7132132,5,B00WGEAJBI,"I've been searching for this for YEARS, hoping someone would come up with a DVD, eventually (PBS, I am forever in your debt) and driven crazy by the tantalizing excerpts on YouTube and elsewhere.  'L'Allegro' (strictly speaking, not an oratorio but a 'pastoral ode') has been a favourite of mine for decades, and Mark Morris has done what, in abstract, might seem to most folks nigh-on impossible:  fashioned a dance piece that is so in tune with the score that the two components, music and dance, support and reinforce each other (not that either needs reinforcing).

The performance of the music (live - Morris won't have it any other way) is first-rate - there have been some quibbles about one or two of the soloists, and it would be been nice to have a treble voice as one of the two sopranos (as is often the case in performance in the UK), and conductor Jane Glover has a wonderful feel for the score.  As noted above, the lighting and the design are stunningly good, absolutely right for Handel's music and Morris's choreography.  The television production is a model of how to shoot dance in live performance.

Worth every penny of the thirty bucks, and then some.

7132133,5,B00WGEAJBI,"First rate. This is so welcome since this ballet, which requires an orchestra, soloists and chorus as well as a lot of dancers, is rarely performed. But now we have here a beautiful and very well done record to come back to again and again. Knowing the libretto is not essential but a good thing....it adds (of course). Trying to read it from the booklet AND watch is hopeless, so if you don't know the Handel, you may watch again and again and slowly drink in the subtle nuances between ideas and gesture that repeat throughout the piece. So rewarding.

Even if you don't particularly love Baroque oratorio or modern dance, you will still like this piece. It's fresh and easy to absorb. Sometimes Morris' choreography is utterly literal.... like in the hunting aria, or the two bird arias, or ""Let Me Wander not Unseen..."", sometime it is abstract (""Come and Trip it..."" ""As Steals the Morn..."") Sometimes both at the same time ( ""Come Come Thou Goddess..."" ""Haste Thee Nymph...."") It's never unfathomable.

The scenery is an amazing example what can be done with a white box and beautiful, inventive (and coordinated) lighting as the piece moves from earthy tones in the first half to the saturated colors of the triumphant second half ending with great joy.",1433116800,9,1260,4.775229357798165
8713310,5,B00WGEAJBI,"This is my favorite piece of choreography by Mark Morris. The minimalistic ever changing sets and costumes are done in smooth transitions. I love the Blake inspired dresses. The dancing is deceptively simple. Sections like ""The Hunt"" feature his quirky humor and storytelling ability. ""Cathedral"" a more reverent poise. There is also a wonderful folk dance inspired piece. There is a mood for every person in this contemporary dance masterpiece.",1524441600,,445,5.371428571428571

8713313,5,B00WGEAJBI,"I've often tried to approach music from the baroque period with appreciation, but, I've never been able to do so. I love ballet and modern dance, so I decided to watch this production on PBS. Mark Morris is a genius!!! I have seen live performances of the world's great ballet/dance companies. The Morris group is among the best - even if you turn the volume down. (If there were music for the deaf, this is what it would look like - eye-music!) The choreography is simply amazing. So are the set designs and costumes.
This production inspired me to buy the other two Morris DVDs - ""The Hard Nut"" and ""Dido and Aeneas,"" in which a young Morris himself plays male and female roles. You simply must see the ""Waltz of the Snow Flakes"" from Tchaikovsky's ballet ""Nutcracker"" - or the Morris version of it, I mean. Wow!!!
Not being familiar with the Handel libretto, my only complaint about this DVD is that subtitles aren't there. (O.K.  There IS a nice 24-page booklet that comes with the DVD.  And it DOES have an English/French/Spanish libretto.  But, I cannot see the relationship of the libretto with the 31 dances.)  While the English singing cannot be understood, sometimes one gets the general idea what words should be associated with each dance. The hunt scene, for example, with each dancer appearing as fox or hunter, hunting party or landscape, is clear.or one wishes it was as clear as it seemed.  BUT, one must filter what one THINKS one sees with the MORRIS WORLD VIEW.
The Morris world-view is unique.  And it takes some getting used to.  So, the photographer of the present work avoided any view or sound of immediate audience reaction to what Morris was presenting (until after the show was over).  Surely the audience reaction would have been much different in states with Republican governors than other states.
In order to better understand the sociological implications of Morris, lets review some history:
There was not a peep of Sexism! from the throngs of women and children as they left the Titanic.  And it wasn't until twenty years after Rosie the Riveter, that modern American women (i.e. feminists) started moaning about how demeaning it was for men to open car doors for them.  Such behavior on the part of men had existed as long as men did.  It was based on a shared recognition that men had power and strength and women did not.  And it was eventually decided that a total change was in order and that nothing less than complete gender equality would suffice.
For Morris, none of this history nonsense exists.  Nor does gender exist.  Men and women are both simply people.  So, when in a Morris work, you see what appears to be two men holding hands, gazing into each others eyes as they walk away,  you are NOT seeing two men at all, but two people!  They could well be a man and a womanor two women.
Certainly the bizarre mens dance Morris has conceived, when viewed as it appears - not as a presentation of macho locker-room hijinks after winning the football trophy, but as a large group of men at a Christian gay bar on the night the bouncer was on vacation, would raise eyebrows  even in the gay community.  The dance shows pairs of men prancing in a circle while holding hands.  And then, alternately slapping the faces and butts of each other, then kissing a (face) cheek of the partner.  In the Morris world, we are seeing not a dance metaphor for gay marriage, but alternative facts about intimacy/tenderness between people.  There are many ancient folk dances for men-only.  Many of those involve mock battles with sticks.  There is only one folk dance where men slap each other - the German/Austrian Slap Dance.
The DVD has bonus tracks.  The first is the Overture Concerto Grosse in G minor.  The second is a 9 minute documentary in which Morris and a few dancers explain their feelings about this work.
The set design by Adrianne Lobel couldn't be more fascinating and the scrim-work adds a lot to ones overall impression.  Added to that, the lighting by James Ingalls leaves nothing to be desired.  Jane Glover conducts the orchestra.  Sopranos Sarah-Jane Brandon and Elizabeth Watts, tenor James Gilcrest, and baritone Andrew Foster-Williams remain in the pit and thanks to the film director, Vincent Bataillon, we only see them during the opening credits and during the bows.  This is as it should be.  It is awful when the photographer tries to be cute by doing more than his job.  Nor does the photographer make this production about the audience, which one never sees nor hears until the bows.
I wish that I could see more Morris.",1496275200,,4581,4.694618272841051

8713317,5,B00WGEAJBI,"I think Mark Morris is definitely one of the great, genius choreographers of our age, and this is one of his masterpieces. His marriage of music and movement is a match made in heaven. Musical phrases and physical gestures enhance each other and make a whole greater than either one of the parts. One can only marvel at the beauty and talent of the dancers. It is a feast for the eye and the ear.",1456099200,,396,4.293333333333333
