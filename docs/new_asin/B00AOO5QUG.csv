8555436,3,B00AOO5QUG,"Made another mistake with this one, didn't know it was from Reality Films which has a tendency to copy their interviews from other discs and then sell them separately and this is the case here as I already have the Fastwalkers movie/docudrama in full so the Jim Marrs
& Steven Greer interviews are repeats. They need to put these UFO Chronicles in a complete box set for sale in full episode mode for a nominal price so we can see them all together, and stop repeating yourselves. It's frustrating & expensive sometimes.",1466726400,,520,4.663043478260869
8555437,3,B00AOO5QUG,"This video features interviews with two relatively well known American UFO-logists, Jim Marrs and Steven Greer. Both are probably pretty moderate by American UFO-logy standards, and just as surely very extreme by more mainline standards.

If I understand them correctly, neither Marrs nor Greer claims that the aliens, as a general rule, are evil (although Marrs concedes that a few alien factions might be). They could have invaded us long ago, had they wanted to. The real evil is government secrecy, with the administration being controlled by, or kept in the dark by, rich and powerful oligarchs. They know that the aliens are real and that UFOs are powered by free energy sources. The oligarchs, some of whom control the oil industry, fear that knowledge of this free energy will threaten their economic monopolies and hence their political power. This is the main reason behind UFO secrecy.

Greer's position is illogical, since in his scenario (better developed in his books) the aliens are near-angelic beings with super-powers  why can't they land on the White House lawn and stop the oligarchic conspiracy (or use more secretive methods to crush it)? Marrs' position, while extreme, sounds more rational, at least judging by this interview. He regards most aliens as neutral or indifferent to our concerns, while a few want to interfere in our evolution, but only gradually by a kind of habituation procedure. This, presumably, explains why they don't attack the Illuminati at the present time.

Both interviews are relatively boring, but if you happen to be a fan of these two guys, I suppose this could be of some passing interest, but probably not a substitute for actually reading their books.

8555441,1,B00AOO5QUG,"This DVD is not what it I thought it would be based on the description in  the advertisement. I expected to hear the eyewitness accounts of military personnel, govt. officials,airline piolets,ect. but got only a boring monologue by Dr. Geer. Same with Jim Marrs except his monologue lasted for only about 5 minutes.",1366416000,9,315,4.943396226415095
8555442,1,B00AOO5QUG,"This was one of the biggest waist's of money i've spent on Amazon yet. As a matter of fact, this is the first review I have written about anything just to let people know not to buy this movie. There are no video's or pictures of ufo's or anything like that. Being a total UFO buff, I enjoy any info regarding the subject, and this was an extreme dissapointment. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY. You would figure in this day and age with all the latest UFO sightings, something would come out of this new release on the subject. NOPE!!! JUNK!!!",1365638400,12,535,4.36

8555444,5,B00AOO5QUG,It's well known among those that study ufos that numerous astronauts have seen things in outer space that aren't public knowledge.
