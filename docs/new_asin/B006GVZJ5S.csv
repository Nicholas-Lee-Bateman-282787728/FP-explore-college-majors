8497900,4,B006GVZJ5S,"In EASY FORTUNE HAPPY LIFE, one can see the various elements that have coalesced to make Taiwanese/Korean TV dramas as widely appealing as they are. There is the Handsome Rich Guy who falls for the Beautiful but Poor girl, both of whom at first, take an instant dislike toward each other. The more they bicker the closer they become. The Rich Guy's Evil Matriarch opposes the union convinced that the Beautiful but Poor girl is a conniving gold digger until at last the former is won over by the latter's innate goodness. Along the way near-tragedies abound--auto accidents, brain tumors, amnesia, and other such melodramatic events. The couple breaks up--usually due to a far-fetched misunderstanding--until as in a Shakespearean comedy all such pseudo-catastrophes morph into joyous marriage. Often there are parallel subplots mirroring the primary one. Further, far too many of the cast engages in interminable pouting and whining replete with Vaudevillian facial double takes. Finally, at key scenes of hoped for high comedy, one of the minor characters will see or hear some especially funny event and will respond with an inserted ""boinnng"" sound right out of the Little Rascals.

In a nutshell this is the plot of EASY FORTUNE HAPPY LIFE, a twenty-seven episode series revolving around a wealthy but arrogant scion of a brutish grandfather who grows less brutish as the story advances. Enter the Beautiful but Poor girl who is a herbalist who possesses a near-magical herb with wondrous powers of healing. In the very first episode both amazingly fall into a marsh where the jerk kisses her merely to stop her from insulting him. The remainder of the plot advances as indicated above. But one does not mind being logically bamboozled by the paper-thin machinations of the script. The leads are gorgeous and they can bounce off one another in just the right way, regardless of whether he is dying of brain cancer or she is being mercilessly insulted by him. What the audience wants is to merge vicariously with the leads. There are about an equal number of scenes of ridiculous low comedy balanced by tearful scenes of encroaching disaster. One does not watch a film like EASY FORTUNE HAPPY LIFE to ponder the mysteries of guilt versus atonement (though this one is definitely centered on that binary). One watches it to be reminded that life sometimes does reach the heights of emotional inanities that amazingly enough make us who we are.",1403222400,,2446,4.995098039215686
