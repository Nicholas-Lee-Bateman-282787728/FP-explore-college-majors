8200270,5,B000RETPEQ,"""America's Test Kitchen"" is the best cooking show on TV and the very best show on Public TV. No wonder it's the number one show on Public TV. It is also a zillion times better than anything on the (now) diluted Food Network. Why is that?

For starters, ""America's Test Kitchen"" is the only TV show that I always get consistent high-quality recipes from (my favorites are their broccoli recipe and barbecued picnic chicken.) ""America's Test Kitchen"" is made up of real cooks and chefs that actually cook! It is also the perfect program for anyone that is a beginner because each show includes basic tips and methods.

And, they don't talk about anything besides food, quality ingredients and utensils! I have learned a lot by watching this program (for example, I learned the importance of scoring the skin of a piece of chicken before I put it in the oven.)

The show is a spin-off of the highly rated magazine, ""Cooks Illustrated"" and is hosted by the editor, Christopher Kimball. Julia Collin-Davison (otherwise known as Julia Collin on-air and my favorite hostess) and Bridget Lancaster are also seen most prominently during the cooking portions of the show. I also enjoy the good-natured mean-spirted comments that Chris often makes to Julie and Bridget. They all have a wonderful chemistry together.

Jack Bishop and Adam Ried are mostly seen during the tasting and testing portions of the program. Rounding out the cast are: Becky Hays (usually seen more during the dessert segments,) Rebecca Bruce (she does usually more speciality items and pastry) and Jeremy Sauer (if you catch him during one of his rare eps, it is uaully during a ""science"" segment.)
