3842057,5,B0023T9ZRK,"This is a remarkable performance of two of the great compositions of the twentieth century.
The blu-ray presentation is gorgeous to look at, and the sound is as good as your system will allow.
The conductor delivers an interpretation which is as cogent any I have heard, with a world-class orchestra delivering the goods musically.
While I do not pretend to understand all the intricacies of ballet, I would venture say that the dancers' performances, especially in 'Firebird', are extraordinary, bringing life to what seems to be quite perceptive choreography. The costumes, scenery and staging in general are ravishingly beautiful.
Highly recommended.",1303084800,6,653,5.411764705882353
3842058,5,B0023T9ZRK,"I have read other reviews stating that the direction of the video was distractive. They are wrong. I found the video very entertaining and highly recommend it, even if the music and dancing were not as great. But they are! The dance was fantastic and the music was, Stravinsky! Great video.

3842059,5,B0023T9ZRK,"There's not much I can add to the previous reviews except to agree with the strong recommendations to buy this historic Blu-Ray.  I was raised on le Sacre (would ask my mother to play the ""dinosaur sequence"" that I knew from Fantasia) and then later discovered the rich power and beauty of the Firebird suite.  The complete Firebird Ballet compared to the suite seemed to be loaded with filler music of limited interest. Now with the entire work displayed as a driver for the dance, it all comes completely alive and I will no longer be satisfied with the suite alone.  The choreography to the Rite of Spring appears tame today after so many decades of modern dance have gone under the bridge but as a historic document this achievement is monumental.  This version of Le Sacre is stellar, perhaps I have never heard it sound so ominous and menacing.  Oddly, I still believe that Disney, despite raping the score, developed a powerful set of visual images that can be appreciated for helping new generations get in touch with this remarkable music.  One small quibble about the filming; occasional clips are too close and hence confusing, Fred Astaire was a master at keeping the camera still and just far enough away to let the dancers show all their movements in a coherent perspective.",1279929600,4,1288,4.753363228699552
3842060,5,B0023T9ZRK,"This is the best ballet Blu-ray DVD available to date.  Both ballets are performed live at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg Russia.  Gergiev's interpretation of the Firebird score is superb: rendering all the inner details of this masterpiece with perfect sensitivity to the story and to Fokine's choreography.  In fact, it's worth buying this DVD just to hear the sound recording of the Firebird.  Yet, there's more:  the dancing is also first rate.  Note that this is the same Kirov production of the Firebird filmed in Paris in 2002 featuring Diana Vishneva, also available on DVD (see ""The Kirov Celebrates Nijinsky"").  However, this 2008 performance is overall superior to that older one even though a less famous ballerina, Ekaterina Kondaurova, dances the title role.

Rite of Spring is also very well done but this is the first time I've seen the Nijinsky choreography as reconstructed by Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer.  Seeing it myself for the very first time, I could much more easily understand the reaction of the Parisian audience at the premiere in 1913. Those who contend that the riot was more a result of the choreography than Stravinsky's score are probably right.  Nijinsky's approach is not merely different from classical ballet but nearly hostile to it, sort of an anti-ballet.  Turned in legs, flat feet, off balance and hunched over postures with angular arm positions are all purposely the exact opposite of the classical style.  Most telling of all is that the Chosen One is the one dancer who keeps tripping and falling down, apparently unable to keep her balance. In other words, the least balletic dancer is the one chosen to be glorified in the ritual sacrifice. The dancers also punch their fists into the air - a not so subtle gesture having but one unmistakable meaning to the Parisian audience of the time: Revolution! No wonder fist fights broke out amongst some audience members who had never seen what we now call modern dance.

The sound quality and video production quality are flawless: None of the motion artifacts I've seen on some other ballet DVDs, such as blurring or dancing that's not quite in sync with the music.  As near to perfection as one could possibly hope for.",1278720000,13,2230,4.927807486631016
3842061,4,B0023T9ZRK,"I've always wanted to see the Firebird after having listened to the music in 8th grade and only having the music instructor describe what it was about (OK, I'm an antique and this was before the days of videotape in school). Anyway, this is a beautifully staged and danced production of the Firebird. The costumes are lovely. I was surprised by how short it was at less than 45 minutes; I seemed to remember the music as being longer in school.

The second ballet is far more modern and not really my taste. Had I not read the jacket, I wouldn't have known what it was about. It is supposed to be based on a classic Russian dance, pre-Christian era. It reminded me more of Hollywood's early idea of Native American dances; even the costumes seemed to lean slightly that way. If you are expecting a classical ballet, all this jumping around pigeon-toed will disappoint. This ballet is mercifully short. Spoiler alert: the bears carry off the virgin in the end. That is the entire plot.",1265673600,4,984,4.590909090909091
3842062,5,B0023T9ZRK,"Most of us, I would guess, remember the first time we heard The Rite of Spring. For me, it was when my ninth-grade friend Steven Stucky (who would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2005) decided to introduce me to ""classical"" music by bringing over a Columbia LP by someone named Igor I'd never heard of, conducting a composition of his own, whose title was incomprehensible because I knew no French. The sounds that issued from my record player were even more incomprehensible. They were strange yet exciting, irresistible. Without realizing it, I was reliving for myself what the work's original audience had experienced in 1913 -- a game-changer. Life would no longer be the same.

As did most of us, I would also guess, I continued over the following decades to think of ""Le Sacre du printemps"" as a concert composition for symphony orchestra. Oh sure, I read about the ballet. I just never thought about seeing it. Where would I?

Lo these many years later, after watching ""Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes"" present its reconstruction of the piece as it was first delivered into the world, I will never again be able to think of ""Le Sacre"" as anything but a stage work.

A fascinating, powerful, must-be-seen stage work.

In an engrossing 30-minute interview, Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer describe the exhaustive research that went into their resurrecting Vaslav Nijinsky's original choreography and costumes for ""Le Sacre"" and the countless hours necessary to put it into performance. All of which would be merely academic were it not for that performance, preserved and presented here in vivid Blu-ray color and sound by the Mariinsky Orchestra and Ballet under Valery Gergiev's direction.

That performance is beyond rendering with words because even after more than a century since its creation, ""Le Sacre"" still taps into the primitive, timeless, pre-verbal relationship that connects humanity with the Earth it inhabits. In one form or another -- whether religious or secular, Christian or pagan -- all cultures have presented this continuing progression of the seasons that moves from dying to renewal to dying because all cultures experience it.

Time and time again in the Mariinsky's performance, for no objective reason I can explain, the conjunction of music and stage action sends shock waves through the body. It's that visceral. Never before, in all the times I've listened to ""Le Sacre,"" did I understand how the music does depict the rite of spring, that annual rebirth of body and spirit without which we vanish. Nor did I understand so fully that this cycle of resurrection requires -- first and also last -- a death, a ritual sacrifice.

This haunting vision will remain with me, and I am thankful for it.

""Le Sacre"" is preceded by a dazzling Firebird in Michel Fokine's 1910 choreography and setting. Only 15 years separated the 1895 revival of Swan Lake from the Firebird, which in many ways plays off of Tchaikovsky's classic. Instead of white swans adrift in cool blue water, we have a red-orange creature of blazing heat in brilliant light, running and leaping all over the place. In the initial pas de deux after the prince has captured the Firebird (danced wonderfully by Ekaterina Kondaurova), Fokine's choreography mimics the gestures we are accustomed to seeing from the Swan Queen. Rather than a lake to drown in, we have sparks that fly to ignite romance and victory.

Alone, this Firebird would be worth the price of admission. The staging of ""Le Sacre"" is priceless.",1408665600,4,3525,4.971137521222411
3842063,3,B0023T9ZRK,"Since I bought this DVD for the reconstruction of Nijinskys choreography of ""The Rite of Spring,"" and considered ""The Firebird"" merely a nice bonus, I will restrict my comments to the former work. I have loved the score for over 50 years, and during that time have seen numerous productions with new choreography that, in my opinion, never seemed to have much to do with the actual music, leaving me (along with millions of others) to wonder what the world premiere production might have looked like. When I saw The Joffrey Ballet performing Millicent Hodsons reconstruction in 1987, it was a revelation, everything I hoped (and had imagined) it could be. The miracle of Nijinskys choreography, at least so far as we can recreate it, is that for once, virtually every note of Stravinskys dazzlingly complex score is made manifest on the stage.

Unfortunately, youll have to take my word for it, because Denis Caozzi, the director of this video, apparently doesnt care very much about choreography. Time and again he goes in for close-ups of a single dancers face, which makes no sense at all. Keep in mind that in a live performance, dancers are NEVER meant to be seen in close-up. Stage makeup is specifically designed to be seen from a distance, unless you think it contributes to the aesthetic experience to see the dancers false eyelashes or the cord running under their chin to secure their wigs and headdresses in place. As a friend of mine once said, I don't EVER want a director to decide for us that we don't need to see the dancers feet. In the opening scene, for example, while multiple groups of dancers are each doing different steps, brilliantly matching Stravinskys astonishing cross-rhythms and syncopations, the camera closes in on the face of the Old Woman and holds the shot, as if no one else were on the stage at all. At the beginning of the second half, as the maidens are moving in a circle, the camera shows only the left half of the circle, with totally bare stage next to it. Why? And the overhead shots are ludicrous (note to Mr. Caozzi: You are not Busby Berkeley), and seeing the circular markings on the stage coveringtotally invisible to an actual audienceonly makes the less-than-precision movements by the corps even more bothersome. I had the feeling that if he could, he would have had a floor-level camera looking up so we could see the dancers underwear.

As others have noted, the production as originally filmed by The Joffrey Ballet for the PBS Dance in America series in the late 1980s is vastly superior. I was lucky to be able to videotape that performance when it was first broadcast, and I just rewatched it to compare it to this Mariinsky production. The Joffrey is the company for whom Hodson first crafted her reconstruction, and they presented the world premiere of it. So it isn't surprising that their dancing boasts more precision, more focus and greater dedication to the drama than their Russian colleagues. More important, you can SEE the choreography in the Joffrey video. Its nice to have Hodsons historic reconstruction available on a Blu-ray DVD, but unfortunately this disc is nowhere near the achievement it could have been. A wasted opportunity if there ever was one. What a crying shame that the Joffrey version was never released on DVD.",1391472000,6,3301,4.809859154929577
3842064,3,B0023T9ZRK,"Very little ""ballet dancing"". In the Firebird, the only one who dances is the bird, who is an exquisite dancer! In The Rites of Spring, the dancing is very primitive, not balletic, not interesting. Fell asleep numerous times.

3842065,5,B0023T9ZRK,"Judging from the PBS film of about 10 years ago that recreated the Rite of Spring as originally performed, this performance is a ""Must Have"" for anybody who wants to see what the fuss was all about at the initial performance in 1913.

3842069,1,B0023T9ZRK,"The camera work on Rite of Spring was dreadful.  There were too many pointless close-ups of the virgin's face.  The feet and legs of the dancers were cut off most of the time and the groupings of dancers that make this ballet so effective were cut out.  You really miss 60% of the ballet in this DVD.  The dancing is much too pretty and the female dancers are all far too elegant and restrained in their movements. Nijinsky would be horrified to see what they did to his Sacre.  If you are interested in seeing something far, far better than this, something much closer to the original, watch the Joffrey Ballet's version on YouTube.

3842071,4,B0023T9ZRK,"This disc offers two major ballets by Stravinsky plus an interesting and detailed bonus feature to support the productions. The productions are a determined attempt to recreate the two ballets as originally envisioned by Fokine and Bakst (Firebird 1910) and Nijinsky (Rite 1913). The Firebird was not too difficult to research as this choreography had not previously been lost and is familiar as the basis of most modern performances. The Rite is much more of a problem as Nijinsky did not notate it for posterity. This production has been painstakingly recreated from a considerable number of sources, not least the highly detailed criticisms received from the press and other opponents.

As mentioned above, this performance of the Firebird uses familiar choreography and settings such as in the earlier Royal Ballet version on Opus Arte or the freer Russian TV film version available on Decca. This new production, I find, presents a friendlier Firebird character - slightly less dramatic facial make-up and actions, but essentially the same. The dancing is exquisitly done by the four main characters of the Firebird (Ekaterina Kondaurova), The Prince (Ilya Kuznetsov), the princess (Marianna Pavlova) and Kashchei (Vladimir Ponomarev). The corps de ballet perform with the excellence we all expect from the Kirov Ballet. This is an outstanding account.

The Rite is more ground-breaking in concept. One major change is the way that at times all 47 members of the ballet are separately choreographed as if individual soloists. This fragmentation is intended to maximise the limited stage space and was a Nijinsky innovation which he first tried out in Debussy's 'Afternoon of a Faun' ballet - also the subject of audience unrest. Other new effects include instances of foot stamping and hitting the floor with choreographed hand slaps to create additional sound effects that were clearly meant to be heard and thus create an extra dimension.

The choreography is very stylised in its portrayal of a primitive Rite but, with its use of bright colours for costumes, is generally effective on its own terms. However, the curious idea of pigeon-toed choreography seems to me to be merely odd rather than primal. The dancers do all that is required of them here though and they do it as well as could be expected. Where the choreography mainly fails to convince for me is the final dance to the exhaustive death of the chosen victim. This is just not wild enough - she barely breaks sweat. Instead it seems that she dies largely as a result of fear - she stands transfixed for extended periods of time. Basically it seems to me that the choreography simply fails to match the violent intent of the music and it is this that I am sure could be better done by choreographers working today - I have been told that there is a version by MacMillan for instance.

However, that is hardly the point. The point is that with this recording we are able to gain a real insight into the past and what has contributed so much to our present and will lead to the future. An invaluable documents therefore.

The imaging is crisp and with excellent colour rendition. The dancers are seen from various angles including vertically downwards from above. This gives an interesting additional idea of the layout on the stage but not that as originally envisioned. The use of close-up imaging is interesting at times but more full-stage shots would have been even more rewarding in my opinion. The sound is spectacular in the DTS surround format and reveals every footfall of the dancers and one can be in no doubt about their weight and the effort required for the lifts! Stereo is also available. The orchestral contribution is fully revealed as expert in its precision under Gergiev.

The bonus is interesting as already mentioned above but it is for the two ballets, and especially for the Rite, that this will be bought. This is a seriously successful attempt at the Rite as originally conceived and a good performance of the Firebird. As a total purchase this makes a very fine disc and should give a great deal of pleasure to a great number of people. As such, in my opinion, I am sure a 5 star rating is fully deserved.",1342656000,2,4204,4.880952380952381
8349989,5,B0023T9ZRK,"I was introduced to this music as a music student in college and must admit it took some getting used to. Now I find myself thinking of the music often and even whistling the opening bassoon passage. This recording does complete justice to the music and in surround sound totally envelopes the listener in a remarkable sonic experience.

The choreography was of particular interest as efforts were made to try and reconstruct the choreography of the first Paris performance which, of course, is notorious for the audience's reaction to the ballet. I was discussing the choreography with a former professional ballet dancer and now a teacher of ballet and he described the various approaches taken today to the choreography of this work. He pointed out some performances were more ruggedly primal than this one.

This performance was rather subdued and showed considerable restraint by comparison with some contemporary dancing. I found that to be interesting and saw the subdued choreography as a way of letting the music take center stage in the primal savagery arena and keeping the dancing in more of a secondary role. As I am more of a musician than a dancer that approach appealed to me.

The recording of the music and video is outstanding and in the surround mode, very immersive. I enjoyed it very much.",1522713600,,1311,4.923076923076923
8349990,5,B0023T9ZRK,"To say I loved both of these productions would be an understatement. I find it very interesting in both cases to see the original productions, specially with Le Sacre, as I loved the score and had seen a couple modern productions which had nothing to do with the original intentions of Stravinsky and Nijinsky.

Yes, I think the camera work could have been better, specially with those awful views from above, but still manages to convey the excitement and outrage which these ballets generated when they came out.

Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky orchestra's version of the score may not be the most detailed or nuanced, but they give a very raw and direct account of the score, but the real star of the show is the sound. Kudos to the sound engineers from BelAir classics and the Mariinsky theatre from providing us with such a clear and full sound.

It is as close as anyone can get to the original in every respect. It covers choreography, sets and costumes to present as much of the original opening  performances of the Ballets Russe. My one complaint is not about the recreation but about the videography. I am an ""Astarian"". Fred Astaire had a clause in all his contracts after his first move ""Flying Down to Rio"" that he would always be filmed full length. He insisted that dance was seeing the full body/ies of the dancer/s and they should be seen in their entirety, as the whole body was the dance! The problem with modern videorgaphy is the  decision to pan and zoom onto whatever the video director decides is important. When I am sitting as an audinece member in a theatre, I decide what is important for ME! I also want to see the whole stage, to experience the use of space intended by the choreographer. Pan and zoom deprive me of seeing the entire interaction of the dancers and hence the interaction of the choreography. If the choreographer intended that I only see half of the stage or a head or foot shot, wouldn't he or she have created it that way? Aerial views are so Busby Barclay, and totally unecessary for ballet, as I do not sit up in the battens above the stage. Please, please please put me in with the live audience's position.
