BUT, at the end of this series, seeing for the very first time the hands of children, making the sign of peace-and the film coming so emotionally to its end, i was extraordinarily cast into a realm, which only the shedding of tears - UNDERSTOOD!",1524700800,,409,4.189873417721519
7976923,5,B00007JGED,"This is like a stage play. It isn't the greatest cinematic effort of all time. Still, I found it superb. Though it is a dramatization with all the trappings, if watched carefully it does express the challenges the world was experiencing at the time.

7976925,4,B00007JGED,Only because I am not certain of the complete accuracy of the info given did I not give this 5 stars. Even when conversations/speeches/phone calls or recorded we can't be sure what else might have been said. I thought all of the actors did a great job bringing their characters to life. The interspersion of war footage and live action was wonderful.  Most of all the idea of the phone conversations taking place so we could observe both speakers was terrific idea.  It's just too bad that all of the wonderful ideas and partnerships could not really prevent future conflicts.,1521072000,,576,4.75

7976927,5,B00007JGED,"Loved it! I remember watching this when it first aired & have been looking for it for a long time! As a big WWII buff this is right up my alley! When you combine the production value with the caliber of the stars (Michael Caine, Bob Hoskins & John Lithgow) you have a really well done series that makes for an enjoyable evening of binge watching!",1512000000,,346,4.257575757575758
