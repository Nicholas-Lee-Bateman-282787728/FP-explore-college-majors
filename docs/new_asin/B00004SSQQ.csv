7921981,5,B00004SSQQ,"Usually, tributes are made after someone has passed away.  But, for Celia Cruz this was not the case.  Her talent, humility, simplicity, and of course her voice captivated and inspired so many around her so deeply, that they wanted her to be honored while she was still here.  It is this spirit that we see in ""A Night of Salsa"".  Celia in her opening act reminds me of a Cuban doll.  She is beautiful, and her voice is undoubtedly the best.  Her friends, such as Tito Puente and Johnny Pacheco show us how much she was loved (and still is).  For those of us who love salsa, love music, and love Celia, this video is priceless.  Celia is no longer with us in person, but in this video she lives on .  Que en paz descanse la reina de la salsa!",1065744000,15,742,4.205673758865248
7921982,5,B00004SSQQ,"In one of her most memorable stage concerts, Celia Cruz along with the help of some famous friends celebrate the world of Salsa music in pure splendor. ""Celia Cruz & Friends: A Night of Salsa"" is a PBS-produced special that features Celia performing for a sold-out crowd in Hartford, Connecticut. Performing many of her classics, including her trademark song, ""Guantanamera,"" Celia is joined on stage by the late, great Tito Puente, who along with a full Latin orchestra rocks the house by all means necessary.
Later in the program, she is joined on stage by her longtime friend and duet partner, Johnny Pacheco, and by La India, who is known to many as the ""Princess of Salsa."" This performance, which was the final time Celia and Tito performed before his death in May 2000, is not only a fitting tribute to Celia, but to Tito, who Celia has admired and loved since he helped her reach international stardom upon her arrival to New York after she left Cuba shortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. Celia never forgets those who helped her in the past and she graciously gives accolades to all the Puerto Rican artists who always were there for her.
Celia is a true diva. Her choice of costumes and wigs has made her somewhat of a Latina Tina Turner, and her stage persona can't be matched even today. ""Celia Cruz & Friends: A Night of Salsa"" will provide you with an exciting, rhythm-filled performance that all with enjoy. There are no language barriers when it comes to music appreciation and Celia and friends will validate this statement entirely!",969580800,42,1556,4.745387453874539
