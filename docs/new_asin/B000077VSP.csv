1801364,5,B000077VSP,"This movie right here is better than the first one. I love this movie. I can't watch one movie without watching the other. This movie has more twists and turn then the first one. I didn't understand the movie when it first came on, but in the middle I started understanding the movie. I had to run out and buy the 2nd part of the movie because I knew it would be better than the first. If u hasn't seen this movie then u should go and see it. U should in fact go and see both because they are off the chain. This movie is a must go and see. That and the first one. I just cant get enough of both of the movies.",1058140800,,610,3.8492063492063493
1801365,5,B000077VSP,"This is a very steamy, well plotted, adult movie.  It has suspense, which may be a little obvious and predictable from the beginning, but nonetheless entertaining.  Casting was excellent, as MIA (Monica Calhoun)had to choose between 2 equally fine men (Kristoff St. John and Michael Jai White).  The acting was believable.",1058140800,,322,5.2745098039215685
1801366,4,B000077VSP,"This movie is a thriller. Although many would watch it for the sex scenes, and Michael Jai White is one of the finest men I have yet to see on screen, I enjoyed it for the fantasy. I mean the attention and affection Hampton gave Mia is what most women, including me desire. I, myself, would have chosen a better place to do it. The sex club scene is not what I would prefer, but it was a wonderful story.
I applaud the director and producers of this film. To bad it didn't get the publicity that it truly deserved. But that's Hollywood for you. This is surely one for my DVD library.",1056844800,,583,4.168141592920354
1801367,5,B000077VSP,"The first Trois movie was one of those independent films and you could tell it was done on a budget and it was a first time directorial debut for those cats. So surprisingly, the 2nd Trois was up to par on so many levels: direction, acting, cinematography, plot, storyline, production. They did a great job with the second movie and I commend them on their efforts. It was all good and Pandora's Box delivered a suspenseful, erotic thriller with an all-black cast, who did their thing through the entire movie. It stars Monica Calhoun  (who played Mia in the Best Man and was LisaRaye's cousin in Playa's Club), Kristoff St. John (Neil on the Young&Restless), Michael Jai White (he played in Spawn), and it also stars the lightskinneded thick chick from Playa's Club who played Ronnie (one of the girlz after Diamond).
Anyway the movie was tastefully done, it had a great plot and it gave a positive portrayal of black women who are successful in their careers, sassy and sexy. The sex scenes were very passionate and the actors did an excellent job portraying their characters.
Definitely a must-see. This definitely a movie for the ladies because the first was for the men. This time around the lead character has  a fantasy about 2 men and they are both fine as hell. Tyson Beckford has a small role in the beginning!!! The opening scenes are off the chain, it will immediately get your interest. The director's commentary was also good, which is available on the DVD version.",1056672000,16,1479,4.728682170542636
1801368,5,B000077VSP,"This movie was way better than the first one!  They did a real good job and I know they didn't get an expensive budget to work with.  But this movie was on point.  I was expecting it to be bootleg like the first one but this one REALLY surprise me.  Like someone said before, ""watch it with friends, cause will most definitely want to discuss after the show""!!  I'm also interested in the soundtrack.  The music that played when she went to the BOX was very sensual.  If anyone knows how to get the soundtrack or the title of the songs, holla at me!
But anyway, rent this movie or buy it... whatever u prefer to do, but SEE IT!...",1044144000,,630,4.2

1801492,4,B000077VSP,"This is one steamy flick, with a story good enough to justify all the carrying-on. Michael Jai White is a revelation as a beefy seductor; he's been wasted in all those punch-and-kick movies. Soft porn? You bet, but what's life without a few guilty pleasures.",1212105600,,258,4.7555555555555555
1801493,5,B000077VSP,"This installment is by far my favorite.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the fact that it features Michael Jai White (simply Yummi), or if it's because it had the best acting all toghether.

1801495,5,B000077VSP,"HOT, HOT, STEAMY!!!!

Psychologist Mia DuBois is in a boring marriage to an otherwise distracted husband. Enter new client Tammy (whose husband was brutally murdered and she is now the prime suspect). Doing something she knows is against Dr/patient ethics, she's drawn into Tammy's private life in order to gain her trust. Tammy introduces Mia to ""Pandora's Box.""

Should she open it??? Yes, she does and what transpires is a tale of steamy sex, betrayal, deceit and in the end the ""BIG PAY BACK.""",1148342400,2,497,4.904761904761905
1801496,5,B000077VSP,"This was a great movie. It looks like they actually had time to write the script and put quality in it. Unlike other african american movies. I would tell you a detailed description of what happened ,but I haven't seen it in a while. I do remember that it a suspense about a women getting suduced by a man and she is married. It has a unique story line that kept me guessing what was next until the last scene. Great job on that.",1112054400,5,429,4.119047619047619

1801498,5,B000077VSP,I enjoyed the movie very much. I am a collector of independent black films and this by far was an excellent movie. The characters and the plot was very intriguing. All of the actors did an excellent job. I particularly enjoyed Monica Calhoun. She is an exceptional actress to which whom I feel has not received her just respect as an actress. She is such a great actress!,1102982400,3,371,4.470588235294118
1801499,4,B000077VSP,A great movie. Tyson Beckford and Michael Jai White are hot in this movie. Plot kind of put me in the mind of Wild Things but erotic.,1082246400,4,133,3.962962962962963
1801500,4,B000077VSP,"From the very beginning, this film grabs the viewer's attention and never lets go.  Although the film is quite predictable, it's still enjoyable to just watch and see exactly how certain events unfolded and who would be involved and in what capacity.
From the beginning of the film, we know right away that a scheme is under way.  Most of the main characters seem to be people one would never imagine getting caught up in a scheme involving so much deceit and treachery.  The main character is a Psycologist (Mia) whose marriage is on the rocks.  Her main client is a woman who begins to council Mia more than she councils her however.  Mia is lead by her client into a web of treachery fueled by her failing marriage.  At a certain point in the film Mia considers the possibility of having intimate relations with two men at the same time.
Although I really enjoyed this film, I think that it sends a very negative and troubling message and is biased towards women.  In the first ""Trois"", the ending was very fitting and sent a good strong message but the story was much weaker.  This film however, had much better scenes and a richer plot but the message it sent at the end was disturbing to say the least.  That's not to say that the film has no redeeming value however.  I liked the part in the film where the patient says to her Psycologist that she must look deep into herself before she can start to understand someone else.",1064016000,10,1431,4.469230769230769
