8460079,5,B005700MFQ,"I have several of these Unsolved Mysteries Series sets.  The ""Ghosts"" one, that I can think of right off the top of my head, but I know I have a few more.  It's so nice watching this great show episode after episode all in order without commercials and advertisements!  Buy it, you guys, it's really worth it.  You'll even want to keep the series so you can watch them over and over once a year or so.  Really.  Take my word for it!",1363651200,,432,4.144578313253012
