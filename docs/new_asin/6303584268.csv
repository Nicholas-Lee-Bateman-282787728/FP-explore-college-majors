688125,4,6303584268,"Dwarfsploitation at it's most vile!  Evil does indeed come in all shapes in sizes.
The Sinful Dwarf is a pretty straight foward heroine-smuggling/slavery ring flick from the 70's.  It comes equipped with extended soft core sex scenes and other totally bizarre elements that will keep you off balance.

But what really makes this film unbelievably creepy is the explosive acting from the undersized Danish actor, Torben Billie.  Not only does he have an uncanny resemblance to the goofy Jack Black, he plays this particular role with unsettling precision.  Sheesh!  I'm sure he was actually a very nice guy, but damn he's a scary little dude here.

His name is Olaf, and he helps his wicked mother run their London boarding house.  Often times gorgeous women check in, but they don't check out.  He also lures the naive beauties back to the hotel with cute little toys.  Yep, oldest trick in the book.

I can't think of many things more alarming than seeing someone with a child-like appearance doing some of the most unspeakable atrocities to his beautiful female slaves.  Mercy, little man!

With a title like The Sinful Dwarf, you oughtta have some idea what to expect.
Only recommended to the most sinfully warped and depraved of viewers.  You know who you are.",1265328000,13,1264,4.873239436619718
688126,2,6303584268,"The Sinful Dwarf is such a provactive title that I wish the film actually lived up to it. I was expecting to sit through a film full of uncomfortable exploitation grotesqueness and come out feeling filthy but also like I had just had a lot of fun since it is, after all, about a SINFUL DWARF.

I'm so frustrated. It's partly my fault I suppose for letting my imagination run wild when I saw the title, but on the other hand if you're going to name your movie THE SINFUL DWARF, you've got to know people's imaginations will do just that so you'd better be ready to step up to the plate and dish out material that exceeds expectations.

The Sinful Dwarf tells the story of a dwarf and his strange mother who kidnap girls and run a sex slave brothel on the top floor of their apartment building. Torben Bille plays our sinful dwarf expertly. He's very creepy and absolutely oozes sinfulness just by his looks. Everytime he was on screen I was captivated by him. He nailed it for sure. If I met him on the streets I'd probably be a little unnerved meeting him since he pulled off this role so perfectly.

But once I realised sex slave was his game, nothing unexpected was thrown at me. Women are addicted to heroin, tied up, whipped and raped. Okay, sounds shocking, but when you compare it to the gruesomness of other shocking films coming out at the same time, it just looks rather tame.

What's worse than the lack of shock value is that the movie's just plain slow. It's dull, it wanders off showing me things I don't care about and pretty much just wastes time between the shock scenes that weren't all that shocking if you've ever watched any similar films. I had a hard time not turning it off, but I was not giving up hope for a finale that would redeem everything. It never came.

With a title like THE SINFUL DWARF, there should have been some kind of over the top element. There wasn't. On top of that there's too much clutter thrown in dragging The Sinful Dwarf into slow, dull 70s movie hell. The title made me watch it and the title kept me from falling asleep in the middle since the content just disappoints.

My two stars go directly to Torben Bille who at least kept me awake just from his acting, despite the fact that nothing terribly interesting was going on.",1256774400,3,2276,4.394299287410926
688127,4,6303584268,"The Sinful Dwarf is an exploitation/horror film from 1973. The fact is, if you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema...You're looking in the wrong place. The review on the cover says it all; ""The mother of all dwarfsploitation films! Over the top with nudity, sex, and disturbing images. It just doesn't get any sleazier, folks."" This is a perfect example of truth in advertising, because The Sinful Dwarf is a sleazy movie-going experience...But if you don't mind the experience of watching a film about a psychotic dwarf and his even crazier mother, then you could do worse than this.

Torben Bille plays the dwarf, Olaf who assists his mother Lila Lashe with running their rooming house. In the opening scene, we see Olaf lead a girl to the attic of this house before knocking her unconscious. The room in the attic holds several girls, all naked and addicted to heroin, who Lila sells as sex slaves to various people. A young writer named Peter moves into a room with his beautiful wife Mary (Anna Sparrow), who grows suspicious about what exactly is going on in the attic.

But, enough about the plot...This film is 90 minutes long and as can be expected from an exploitation film, it has prolonged, gratuitous sex scenes and lots of nudity. As I said, there are girls locked in the attic that are naked. There's no shortage of anything sexual here.

I'm no aficionado on exploitation films, but I didn't expect much from this film. I watched it more out of morbid curiosity than anything else. The fact is The Sinful Dwarf is a fascinating little exercise in the exploitation genre. It's campy, a little bit creepy, and entertaining in its own strange way. This is a film that not only has two antagonist's, one a dwarf and another a deranged woman prone to prolonged dancing sequences...But, there's an overweight heroin dealer who sports an afro and goes by the name Santa Claus. It doesn't stop there; there's a scene where a girl is whipped where we never see the whip making contact with skin and after cutting back to the girl we see poorly applied red makeup to her body. The film's score sounds like a mix between horror film and porn music. The sets and overall look of the film had the potential to be creepy, but everything else is pure camp...And that's fine.

As for Olaf, he bares a passing resemblance to Jack Black and he is creepy, just never in a scary way. And there's plenty of him here to satisfy those `dwarfsploitation' fans. If you don't like The Sinful Dwarf, I doubt you knew what you were getting into beforehand. If you're curious about this movie, I recommend it...If it looks like something you'd enjoy, you likely will. It's an amusing, campy exploitation flick that is surprisingly better than you'd expect.

In London, a perverted Swedish dwarf who plays the piano lures young women into his alcoholic mother's boarding house, a former nightclub. There they are drugged, whipped, turned into heroin addicts and forced into prostitution. On the lighter side, his mother does do a pretty fair Carmen Miranda routine.
Newlyweds rent a room in a house occupied by the landlady and her son, a three foot dwarf who leers at them through evil eyes in his distorted face.  Strange sounds prompt the young bride to investigate while her husband goes off to find work.  She discovers that young girl have been chained to a wall and tortured in a secret room.
They have been kept drugged while the dwarf forces them to submit to his own carnal desires and to other men who have paid to use them.  Discovered, the wife is captured by the evil dwarf.
The husband is baffled by his wife's disappearance but luckily happens across a clue and calls the police.  They rush to the house and uncover the sordid evil doings.  The landlady and her evil spawn ultimately pay for their sinful ways!",1048723200,5,1163,4.727722772277228

688236,4,6303584268,"This infamous 1973 Danish exploiter is renowned among sleaze-seekers and rightfully so. Its got nubile sex slave abductees chained up in a filthy attic, an amusingly demented dwarf named Olaf and an interesting sub-plot involving a toy store thats a front for heroin trafficking. In other words, The Sinful Dwarf is highly recommended but only for those whose attention spans wane in the absence of degeneracy.

By now, the movie has been talked up enough and the only reason for this review is that Severin Films, the company that made Olaf a household name (in scores of bachelor pads) with its 2009 DVD release has re-released The Sinful Dwarf on blu ray in a limited edition run of 3,000 copies. So do we get to see our favorite cutie-molesting midget elevated to the finely-detailed pinnacles of modern video technology? Of course not! The full frame blu ray image is decent but looks a bit on the yellowy side and the print seems to be coated with a layer of secondhand smoke imparting a fixed splotchiness thats quite visible during the darker scenes. That isn't surprising for a flick of this age and level of obscurity so anyone seeking to see the Sinful Dwarf in some sort of blu ray splendor should prepare to be underwhelmed by this release.

But not so fast! Our friends at Severin aren't about to charge us 20-odd bucks without spiking the cocktail. So here we get both the softcore and hardcore versions along with the real reason for my purchase  an intact version of the Danish-produced porno melodrama The Blue Balloon, which is the most striking kidnap victim-turned-prostitute saga Ive ever seen. Severin claims this to be The Blue Balloons first home video release and while thats not exactly true, this is the first time that a complete version of it has been available (Something Weird Videos version is missing about 20 minutes of the ending and After Hours Cinemas version lacks about the same amount of the beginning).

The Blue Balloons image and audio quality is suitably dingy but still better than the previous releases and the disc has some nice extras (including a midget sex scene from the circus porn feature The Hottest Show in Town and a couple of short documentaries on the main features producers and performers), ensuring a long nights worth of morally questionable entertainment.

Summing it up, this release should satisfy Sinful Dwarf fans who have reasonable expectations about print quality and delivers every greasy pennys worth of the asking price by including the only complete release of The Blue Balloon, plus extras.

Three minutes into the film, we knew this was going to be one sick ride! 'Olaf' (Torben Bille) had a penchant for young innocent girls (who were also naive enough to fall for the charms of a devilish looking dwarf with wind up toys!), as he lured them to follow him home to become unwitting sex slaves! Oh, and his pleasant mother 'Lila' (Clara Keller) actually encouraged this behaviour since it brought in additional income. When a young unsuspecting couple 'Mary' and 'Peter' (Anne Sparrow and Tony Eades) suddenly showed up looking for a room to let, Olaf obligingly agreed (when a dwarf jumps on the bed in the room you're looking to rent and says in a Danish accent..""you see...it is a nice soft bed"" and lets off a sinister cackle. Maybe it's not a good idea and politely you would say thanks, but no thanks!!) and took them upstairs. Did I mention that mother 'Lila' (not to be confused with 'Lola'), appeared to be a washed-up cabaret performer (she definitely did not play the 'Blue Angel') and had an inclination to dress-up and sing after her drinking sessions! This flick is pretty sick and sleazy, but believe it or not it's done in such a campy and looney way that you will actually find yourself laughing along with cuddly Olaf and his dear mother!!! I won't give anymore away. This is the triple xxx version (the film elements do not match, but they do not appear to be inserts), so there was more than just poor naked gals! The actress that played Mary (Anne Sparrow) was actually pretty good, and she definitely had a lovely figure! But its really 'Olaf' and 'Lila' that stole the show here, we even got a quick glimpse at 'Lila's' disfigured body (just kidding, actually the old dame was in pretty good shape. I would have wanted to see more of her with singing of course!!) she did have a scar along her left cheek (on her face, do pay attention)! This was an American-Danish co-production, and as I've written so many times before, only in the 70's could they have gotten away with a barbaric and sadistic piece of work like this one ( but of course plenty of enthusiasts like myself already knew that) it's pretty bad. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars, the pacing was slow and unfortunately the production-values here were very low ($10,000.00 more from uncle Harry, could have raised the bar!) not the best lighting or camera work. The DVD picture quality by Private Screenings X was pretty good, but could have been better! English (no subtitles) NTSC, NR 96 mins.

688298,3,6303584268,"Okay, I'm not sure which came first and won't criticize based on any ""rip off"" theories, but this movie is one part ""Thriller"" and one part ""Bloodsucking Freaks"".  Basically, Olaf the demented dwarf and his alcoholic, ex-cabaret performing mother are running a sex trade and boarding house from their creepy dwelling.  Olaf picks up young girls off the street by luring them in with toys and jacks them up on heroin so they'll do whatever the evil two command (kind of reminiscent of ""The Gruesome Twosome"" as well).  A young couple actually decides to take board in the weird place which looks more like a factory from the outside than a house.  The female half of the couple becomes curious when she hears noises and does some Nancy Drew work for herself.  Her husband is more skeptical and ends up getting a job with the dopeman a.k.a. ""Santa"" who is supplying the drugs to Olaf and his weirdo mother.  There are many voyeuristic overtones in this movie and it weighs heavily on the gratuitous nudity.  If you like 70's porn, you might enjoy this.  Olaf is mainly a pervert who enjoys seeing his captives in pain.  I found his thumping cane a bit annoying and his strange accent slightly more annoying.  However, his mother is entertaining with her bizarro caberet numbers and her equally batty friend who encourages her.  There are some awesome points to this movie.  First of all, the opening credits rock.  The weird music, wind up toys and bright lettering are somewhat better than aspects of the entire movie.  Second, the bizarro caberet performances by Olaf's mother are not only hilarious, but I'm waiting to buy the soundtrack.  Third, the girls ARE beautiful although they are not in a good situation by any means.  Fourth, Olaf slightly looks like Jack Black shrunken down a few notches.  Despite the bright spots, I still think ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" and ""Thriller"" are the better pictures.  ""Sinful Dwarf"" becomes rather dull and repetetive and the shock has been seen before in better forms.  I wouldn't write it off for good, but don't spend you last dollars on it.

He`ll make your skin crawl on more than one occasion, and his crazed 'Baby Jane'-type mother will do likewise. The idea of kidnapping girls, chaining them up in the attic, making them herion-addicted and suitable for rape to paying 'johns' to cover the bills is downright dispicable but, without it, we`d have no movie.

7851272,5,6303584268,"Two things came out from my mind while finishing watching this film.
1. The ending seems a lot, I mean a lot like Tim Burton's BATMAN ending.
2. The movie has something to do with PINK FLAMINGOS and why is that movie so famous and that movie is a cult classic and this one is not and also this one is criticised as a bad, perversive pornish sleazy movie?
The two films have the same attitude and some of the shots are even similar. Both films are meant to be cult classic.

Also as mentioned earlier I have this feeling that Tim Burton must have seen this film and have had re-used the ending shot for omage.
That is when the dwarf is throwing his body to the window and when he is dying with bleeding, the dog doll is making the sound of barking. And the dwarf is trying to reach his hand to grab that dog doll. The soft music overlanps.
The moment when the camera is moving to show the dwarf bleeding and the doll is exactly the same as the Joker is jumped off from the roof top and finally dies. And we hear the strange laughter sound coming out from the recording machine from his pocket.

Also there is this moment where the dwarf's mother is singing with the colorful dress on which is kind of disgusting since she is so old and nasty looking, she acts like she is a star singer and she sings horribly. That shot for some reason reminded me of PINK FLAMINGOS.
Her dress, her singing, the enviorment.
Also the fact the film stock was so bad and they shot in 4:3 16mm film and even though the movie was bluray the image was so bad, all together reminded me of B movie like PINK FLAMINGOS.

The story is simple Dwarf and his mother runs this INN and that inn is kind of illegal somehow since they kidnaps beautiful girls and make them addict to heroine and undress them and keep them in on wooden room. They make them prostitutes.
One day this husband and wife stop by for the cheap room to stay and since the man got a great job and has to stay for a couple of days there.
The wife hears things from the top floor. Everyday the girls are meeting with different men to sell their bodies so they make some noises.
While the husband is gone for work, finally the wife discovers the room and she was caught.
She becomes one of them and they made her a prostitute too. They undress her as other women and inject heroine as well.
Husband came back and sees the fake note saying the wife is tired of the husband and she is leaving.
Hearing the fact that the dwarf actually did put her in a room and made her sell her body, the husband finally goes to a police and they release the whole women.

The dwarf at the end throws his body into the window and kills himself. He is nothing but another poor guy who did things that his mother told him. He hears the dog doll barking and the moody melody and slowly dies.

There are really stupid extra works on this blurays like dwarf short porns and so on but I don't think that necesarily mean that this film is also a porn.
And also this movie has two ways to watch. One is a theatrical release and the other extended version added about 8 minutes include real sex.
Again that doesn't mean it is all porn.
I think the director still struggled a lot to complete this film and the result was a pretty good something film.",1467158400,3,3259,4.199680511182109

7851274,1,6303584268,"Severin is a great company that usually puts out a wonderful quality product; unfortunately, The Sinful Dwarf on Blu-ray is not one of those products. It looks like their remastering was simply a transfer of the original DVD digital material and not struck from any film elements. The blacks are mid-to-dark grey and during most scenes it looks like the film is being projected against a dirty sheet.

  I understand the film is rare and the original source material is probably non-existent, but why bother releasing a limited edition (of 3,000!!!) Blu-ray when you have nothing to add from the original DVD release? Unless, you are just trying to squeeze a few more dollars from fanboys (like me) who have already purchased both of Severins original DVD releases, greed can be the only answer.

  When I compare my Severin DVDs against the newly released Severin Blu-ray, the prints are exactly the same (the cue dots and fiber pulls are the same) but the DVDs quality is much better.  Please take my advice and keep your DVDs. There is no reason to re-purchase this one. If you do not own this film, hunt down the original DVDs and purchase those. You will save yourself some money and be much happier.",1464912000,5,1205,4.7368421052631575
