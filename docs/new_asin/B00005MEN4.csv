7945442,5,B00005MEN4,"this show airs often on the Smile of a Child channel, this show teaches appropriate vocabulary and how kids should respond in many different situations and also helps teach them what is expected appropriate behavior and what is not even from adults. This is a great companion with America's Most Wanted John Walsh's shows Stranger Safety and Internet Safety, with all these shows you'll have all dangerous situations covered with your kids, many libraries have safety shows to borrow, I highly recommend all them.",1291939200,,513,5.119047619047619
7945443,5,B00005MEN4,"I am a former school resource officer.  This video is great for showing in classrooms of elementary-aged students. Retro Bill keeps things moving at a fast pace and it is edited like a live-action cartoon with fun music, so it keeps the students' attention.  My daughter has watched this video many times at home on her own.  One of the best videos for different safety tips for kids.",1053302400,,384,4.617647058823529
