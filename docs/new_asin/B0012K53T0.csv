8246356,3,B0012K53T0,"Don't let the cover art on ALPHA VIDEO's ""Laurel & Hardy - Early Silent Classics"" fool you! Except for LUCKY DOG, Stan and Ollie DO NOT appear together in any of these silent era shorts, and even here they aren't a ""team."" With the exception of three selections on Disc #3, you also won't see the trademark derbies, nor have L&H yet developed those individual screen personas that would in the late 1920s make them worldwide stars.

In many Ollie has a minor role, often playing a bad guy. In Stan's comedies, he's clearly searching for a character. Best are his film parodies. Besides silent pictures, Volume 3 features an in-color public service short, one made for fundraising and Stan's home movies.

ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere. Their prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet this product's rareness and an honest price make it a worthwhile purchase.
