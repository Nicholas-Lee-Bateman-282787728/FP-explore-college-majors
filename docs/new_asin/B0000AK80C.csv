1908001,5,B0000AK80C,"Millennium Actress is one of the most touching Animes I have watched in a very long time.  As another reviewer had hinted, this anime can be depressing.  However, it is depressing in a very good, Saving Private Ryan sort of way.  I would not be surprised if some people actually shed a few tears while watching this, I was pretty close to just doing that.
When I first saw this DVD at the video rental store I figured it would be like Perfect Blue, the director's previous Anime.  It is interesting because on the Special Feature section of the DVD, the creators of Millennium Actress actually said that they wanted to make something like Perfect Blue.  However the story to Millennium Actress is completely different.  The story is still focused on an actress but instead of suspense, this anime is one gigantic love story which takes you through different periods of Japanese film culture.
One thing which I really enjoyed about this anime is the great creativity which is used to tell the story.  It is difficult to explain in words but the main character Chiyako is seen jumping from movies to movies from different eras in order to advance the plot.  This way of story telling is certainly the first I have seen in an Anime and is implemented very well.
Overall I strongly recommend this anime to most viewers.  Unlike Perfect Blue there are no sex scenes and very little violence in this Anime which would explain the PG rating.  However, the subject matter and the complexity of the story in this anime would be much more appreciated by adults.",1067731200,80,1551,4.669117647058823
1908002,5,B0000AK80C,"If you are able to surrender yourself to the whimsy and pathos of this superbly crafted film, you will be deeply touched and greatly rewarded. It has the complexity of ""Perfect Blue"" and the depth of ""Grave of the Fireflies"". Wonderful anime.",1067731200,5,242,4.785714285714286
1908003,4,B0000AK80C,"MILLENIUM ACTRESS is an extremely ambitious, brilliantly executed animated film by the extremely talented Satashi Kon, who previously directed the marvelous PERFECT BLUE.  There are many, many exquisite moments, where Kon is clearly pulling out all the stops to try to take animation to a completely new level, with a cascade of marvelous images and attempts to animate effects that have never or rarely been attempted before.  From a sheer technical perspective, this film is really hard to top.  Unfortunately, I personally found the story lagging behind the animation.  Nonetheless, this film is certain to delight any fan of anime.
As much as I loved the animation, and even loved many individual scenes, the film as a whole just didn't quite come together.  The story's pretext reminded me a bit of the puzzle facing Billy Pilgrim in SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE:  like Pilgrim, famous and aging actress Chiyoko Fujiwara has become unstuck in time.  Her migrations in time occur during an interview with a representative from her former studio, who turns out to have been in love with her for many years.  During their interview, Chiyoko and her two interviewers travel magically to and fro during the course of her childhood and film career, in many instances reenacting famous scenes in her career.  Throughout it all, she remains obsessed with a key that she has promised to return to a mysterious painter and political revolutionary (despite Japan's political conservativism during many parts of its history in the 20th century, the heroes in this film are all rebels or friends of rebels).
The film ends with a theme not dissimilar to one of the ""Theses Actually or Possibly Attributable to Lessing"" in Kierkegaard's CONCLUDING UNSCIENTIFIC POSTSCRIPT, where Lessing/Kierkegaard, being offered either the Truth which God hold in his right hand or the search for the Truth which he holds in his left, chooses the left hand.  Chiyoko is never able to return the key to her beloved, but at the end of her life she learns that the lifelong attempt and struggle to do so was the most important thing in life.  In this way, her mysterious stranger becomes symbolic for all that is most important.  The problem is that the narrative that would express this becomes too frequently erratic or incoherent.  Furthermore, because of the narrative problems in the film, I found my interest level sagging towards the end of the film.
Nonetheless, this remains an absolutely first rate film, and one of the most fascinating examples of adult animation I have seen, though by adult I don't mean in any way obscene.  I'm not certain that a small child would find this film very interesting, but neither would a parent find anything in it inappropriate for a child.",1063238400,19,2748,4.9846827133479215
1908004,5,B0000AK80C,"This sweeping anime epic follows an aging actress as she tells the story of her life to two documentary filmmakers.  This films storyline is not linear so any synopsis would not due it justice. Needless to say if you are a fan of Anime.. Not just the fanboy or mecha anime but gorgeous animation with mature themes and stories.  You will be blown away by this film.  Even if anime is not your cup of tea, the sophistaced story will awaken you to the fact that animation is not just for kids anymore.  Easily one of the best films I have seen this past year.",1062806400,,557,4.276190476190476
1908005,5,B0000AK80C,"Millennium Actress tells the story of a Japanese actress's career through a lifetime of various roles.  Even if you're put off by Japanese animation, you'll be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one.  It's up there with the best the medium can offer and it's a drama, through and through.

The movie also has a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack by long time Satoshi Kon collaborator, Susumu Hirasawa.

Sadly, the movie is out of print and no domestic Bluray release has been announced, driving up the price.  There is a Japanese Bluray version, however, it has no English subtitles.

However, if you can get your hand on this, watch it! It's a heart touching tale like no other and a testament to the power of traditional animation as a storytelling medium.",1440201600,,764,4.838461538461538
1908006,5,B0000AK80C,"Definitely one of those movies that you have to watch more than once to truly understand what's going on (typical of Satoshi Kon films), but one of my all time favorites.",1437091200,,170,4.516129032258065
1908007,5,B0000AK80C,"I try to show this movie to my students after our unit on Japanese history every year. Beautiful animation, powerful storytelling, gorgeous music -- I love it!",1433635200,,159,4.925925925925926
1908008,3,B0000AK80C,"In this interesting, very attractively drawn anime from Japan, a TV journalist gets to interview Chiyoko Fujiwara, a once famous actress who mysteriously became a recluse after retiring from acting some 30  years ago.  As she is interviewed about her movies, she turns into the characters she played, in different eras and in different genres, and fantasy becomes confused with reality.

The movies conceit is interesting. How it is carried out, not so much. At times, the story becomes a bit too confusing. A more straight-lined screenplay would have helped.

Note: Though she doesnt look terribly like her, Chiyoko Fujiwara is obviously inspired on Setsuko Hara (born in 1920), the beautiful actress who starred in many of the best films of Yasujiro Ozu (she was the understanding daughter in law in Tokyo Story), and also in some films of Akira Kurosawa and Mikio Naruse. Hara not only retired from cinema, but also has rejected any interviews for 50 years, living an apparently recluse life in Kamakura, the Tokyo suburb where many Ozus films are set (and where Ozu himself is buried). In the movie, Fujiwara seclusion is due to an early romantic disappointment. As far as I know, no one knows the reason of Haras disappearance from public life.

Interestingly, director Satoshi Kon was born in 1963, the same year Setsuko Hara retired from cinema (and also the same year Yasujiro Ozu died). Kon unfortunately died of cancer in 2010; Setsuko Hara incredibly, is alive as of 2015.",1428451200,,1483,4.963709677419355
1908009,5,B0000AK80C,"Maybe the greatest movie actress of Japan - some considered her the Century Actress - born at the beginning at the twenties, starting to play in her teens, spanning a prodigious career over three decades of movie history, to vanish at her peak! She gave weak reasons (or no reasons at all) for her decision to leave the public life; her anonymity has been total ever since.

Decades have passed, new generations of public came and little by little the great actress was forgotten. Of course, film critics are still mentioning her name when analyzing the movies of the forties and fifties; but they are talking at the past, as of a person who lived in a bygone era.

Has everybody forgotten her? No, of course not, there will be always people passionate for her movies and fascinated by her personality: people dreaming to find her and to tell her their fascination.

And here is the place where Sennen joy (Millennium Actress) starts: a devoted fan succeeds to find her and she accepts to be interviewed by him. As they start talking, the past comes back in force and overwhelms the present. Scenes from all her movies, and what happened behind the scenes: she was playing the lead role, he was just a young assistant by then. The present is no more, their memories join in a unique flow. The old star and her fan live again the past, this time the meaning of those moments comes enriched: she is now aware of his presence on the plateau. Actually the past is not repeated: the force of their memories makes the past a continuous moment, time looses any significance. There is no more a succession of moments; there are only moments charged with emotional value, that remain forever.

Kon Satoshi is an Anim film director,which was fortunate for this movie, as he kept this way total control over the story and was able to blur past and present, life on the plateau and life outside it; more than that, he was able this way to change completely the image style of each reenacted scene in accordance to the specific period; Jidaigeki movies from the twenties and early thirties, propaganda movies from the period of Manchurian occupation, dramas from late forties and fifties, Sci-Fi movies from the sixties on. What resulted was a fascinating history of Japanese cinema in its most significant moments!

Is the feminine personage in the movie an allusion to Setusko Hara? The director did not confirm this suggestion. Nevertheless I would say yes, for many reasons, the main reason being that for me it is only Setsuko Hara who deserves to be named the Millennium Actress.",1421366400,,2572,4.719376391982182

1908011,5,B0000AK80C,"This film had one of the most unique premises I'd seen in awhile.

Basically, a film director and his cameraman go to interview a famous actress, now in her twilight years, who suddenly and inexplicably vanished from the film world.

She allows them to come to her home and speak to her, something no one but her house keeper has been allowed to do for years.

She tells them the story of her life, and they relive it together through the plots of the films in which she starred.  Sometimes the crew are active participants in the story, other times outside observers with camera in hand.

This type of storytelling is not only unique, but also extremely well-executed.

The ending left both in all and in tears.

Copies of this can be hard to find.  If you see one, snatch it up.",1418342400,,780,4.443661971830986

1908013,5,B0000AK80C,"Satoshi Kon's second directorial effort is a vast improvement over his first, Perfect Blue.
Here the story structure is intriguing and fresh, it will keep you thinking.  Just who's perspective is this story being told by?

The basic story is two video reporters doing a story on an elderly retired actress.  But it is how Satochi tells this story and puts everyone into the story that makes this a standout.

Some have said it is a sad story, but it is more of a story of romance and pursuing.  But their is more than one romance and pursuit in this story.",1404604800,,556,4.465346534653466
1908014,5,B0000AK80C,"Satoshi Kon only lived to create a half-dozen titles, but this may be his best.  The life and career of fictional film-idol Chiyoko Fujiwara, known in her prime as Japan's Madonna but now retired at age 70, is told as a documentary film-within-a-film.  Born on the day of the big 1923 earthquake, growing up during the prewar military imperialist government, the heroine's life is played out against the lives she put on the screen, in everything from classics to B-movie genre pictures.  A western audience may not recognize the difference between, say, a courtly drama from the Heian period and a 17th century melodrama, but history is the canvas that allows her to play out her life and her search for love.  The lines between cinema and reality get constantly blurred, but we're happy to be along for the ride.",1396569600,,814,4.792857142857143

1908018,5,B0000AK80C,"Enough other people have given in depth reviews, so it would be redundant to do it again.  I will just say that this is one of the finest Anime films I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.  In my top 10 for sure.  To be honest I don't hold Satoshi Kon in the same esteem as many do.  I personally didn't care for Perfect Blue.  But this film was a true masterpiece.  And I'm glad that they didn't even attempt to dub it in English because it couldn't possibly have done justice to the Japanese voice actors... he absolutely hit a home wrong casting the voices for this gem.  Right down to the smallest of parts, like the wraith... she had such a sinister laugh, it was uber creepy.

It should also be noted that I'm a grown man all of 6'4"", and this film reduced me to tears by the end.  And that doesn't happen often.",1388361600,,818,4.159235668789809
1908019,5,B0000AK80C,I had watched one other movie by Satoshi Kon ('Paprika') a little while back and loved it so I decided to see what else he had directed. One of the movies listed was Millennium Actress and it sounded interesting so I decided to watch it. I can honestly say that I loved that movie way more than I had expected to. It didn't give me the type of predictable ending I thought it would and I both loved and hated that. Not only was the story line great but so was the animation and the characters themselves. Though there is nothing unseemly within the movie the twisting plot is more suited for someone older despite the movie's PG rating.,1375920000,,636,4.352941176470588

However, I'd really have to say this one is special for me.
The plot and pacing is so remarkable. The emotion and symbolism
conveyed is flawless. The art and music is breathtaking.
What I really love is the ending. I can't say the last time I've
watched something and had it perfectly end in every way I imagined.

1908025,5,B0000AK80C,"I actually bought this after renting it several times through the years. I love this film. It has the magic of Kon's other films, but inspires nostalgia rather than the dread of Paranoia Agent and Perfect Blue.

1908026,4,B0000AK80C,"I liked it, well made and all that, but it isn't one that I'd really watch again. The storyline is very well conceived of and executed.

1908027,4,B0000AK80C,"I think this must have been a tough film in which to tell the story clearly, but it was done very skillfully and well. The story was compelling, fascinating, interesting, and unpredictable. It was enjoyable. Tokyo Godfathers was more emotionally affective than this film. I do think the character is a bit fanciful, and perhaps deranged to chase after a man she barely knows, but the fantastical is part of the breadth of this story.",1342396800,,433,4.786666666666667
1908028,5,B0000AK80C,"And I do not use that comparison lightly.  Just as  ""Inceptions"" was a trip through reality, so is this film...but much more romantic.  But don't let the ""romance"" fool you...

FOR PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED PEOPLE:
There is nothing to fear.  The film is very engaging and immersive...but doing all that without having to stoop to using provocative material, fan service, nor coarse language.  This is not a film for children, though, because it's a very mature and complicated film.

MOVING ON:
This is the first animated art film to truly draw me in.  I will tell you, this film is a real trip.  So what exactly is this film?  It's a documentary, biography, Godzilla, mystery, drama, stage play, samurai flick, sci-fi...yes...it's that hard to explain.  One thing that can be said for sure is that this is a wonderful psychological romance that will really test your mind...think ""Inception"" but ten times more trippy.  It is also a story about love and identity...and the chase (which you can discover the meaning of if you watch).  The plot is fairly simple...but the execution is very very artistic, engaging, and complexed.  I can't describe it, it's just something to experience.  And your emotions will fly at times.  What I will say, pay attention to the dialogue, it's very purposed.  Also pay attention to repetitions, they are clues.  The 3 main characters (Chiyoko, the Interviewer, and the Cameraman) are also very charming, but more importantly they serve as anchors to each other - and in some cases a mirror.  Also, you get to see the growth and development of people over time in a very unique way...as well as this strange phenomena of choice and retrospect.  Simply put, I can't stress how beautiful this film really is.  And it will take much more than one viewing to even begin to grasp a small portion of it.  The ending is epic btw.

Just to let you know, the film is Japanese dubbed with English subtitles.  This is one of the few times that I will say with definite affirmation that this was a wise choice.  Though i'm no purist, I do think in this case a dub would have lost something...not because it would have been bad...but because there's a magical and surreal aspect that the Japanese helps to bring in this film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
Well there isn't really any special features except for  a ""making of..."" feature which is an interview/commentary by Satoshi Kon.

ALL IN ALL:
This film will twist your mind in so many fun and meaningful ways.  It's beautifully pieced together and lovingly crafted.  It is both uplifting, yet sad.  It is so simple and yet so complexed.  You'll need multiple watches...but each watch reveals a new layer of depth and meaning.  All in all, it is a treasured part of my collection.  This is not a film for children.  It is far too complexed and many of the themes will just fly over their heads on top of the complexity.  One cannot watch this passively...but, if you are willing to focus, it can be a rewarding experience.  This film may be difficult for some to follow, but then again...the chase can be quite fun.",1332547200,,3082,4.6934579439252335
1908029,5,B0000AK80C,"Whenever I think about this film, its never animated in my head.  I always see it as live action.  The character will draw you in, you will sympathize with her, and be moved.

It was no longer about understanding or following the story, it was about immersing myself in the most incredible narrative I've ever experienced. Perhaps I love this movie more than other people, but maybe, just maybe you will find yourself forever touched as I was. I'm not ashamed to admit that I started to freak [cry] out as the movie concluded. This is a story about life - from the beginning to the end. The people we love, and the people who love us are all a part of who we are. They touch our lives until the very moment it ends, and perhaps beyond...",1313366400,,731,4.118881118881119
1908031,4,B0000AK80C,"I happen to like Millennium Actress because it was different. That said, I understand that the movie would be difficult for some people to follow. It is hard to tell what is part of a movie that the actress was in and what was actually a part of her real life. However, that shows how much her real life began to blend with her acting career and shows how hard it was for her to understand what was reality and what wasn't.

Add to this, the release over here is one of the few that are not dubbed, the reason being the movie would likely lose a lot of meaning in translation as the language is complex. The movie also has a deeper meaning that many people may not be comfortable looking deeper into, or even having shown to them. Still, the movie is something that will be remembered and if you are into Anime, watching the movie once is a definite.

The art is also amazing, despite the storyline being confusing.",1312070400,,915,4.313953488372093

If you have never seen anime before and want something other than the incredibly violent and/or sexualized and/or surrealistic fare that so often permeates anime and manga, I recommend you see this film first.

Matter of fact, this movie is a perfect example of what Satoshi Kon is capable of. Perfect Blue was a psychological mind-thriller. This movie on the other hand is a drama, of going back to time to see the aged actress' career from start to finish. I will not give out any spoilers but this is definitely a movie to check out if you loved Perfect Blue.",1302739200,,467,4.5058823529411764
1908036,5,B0000AK80C,"*SPOILER ALERT!!!*:

It can get a bit confusing, honestly. From meeting a strange guy in her teen years, she made it her life to look for him the rest of her life to give him an item he'd misplaced. Because of this, she chose to become an actress for that alone.
I loved the style of the movie! Although it would confuse a few people with how it seemed as if her search started all the way in the period surrounding World War II and such, I felt it was truly a story of love and how far a dedicated woman is willing to chase the love of her life just the for sake of returning an object and seeing his face again.
The scenes where Genya and his cameraman appeared as her saviors in each flashback, had me laughing at how she appreciated his help, but continued to move on dangerous paths without the intention of ever stopping.
The movie overall was tear-jerking to me and the ending really told me that love can be seen, but getting to it for the touch is the hardest part. I give this movie 5 stars for the sake that it was just too lovely and I couldn't stop watching it for a minute.
Please, if you ever do get the chance, find this movie and watch it. To be honest, I recommend it in it's original form. No dubs, only subs! :D

1908037,5,B0000AK80C,"A little confusing and slow at first, but overall a very touching film that you will want to have in your library alongside Perfect Blue, Ghost in the Shell, Spirited Away, and Ninja Scroll.",1296777600,,190,4.617647058823529
1908038,4,B0000AK80C,"The tale revolves around a documentary being filmed by a older filmmaker, telling the story of a famous actress that he had worked with in his past, but who had retired years earlier. In the midst of interviewing this lost forgotten screen idol, she tells him her story; of her recruitment to act in patriotic films during the Japanese campaign in Manchuria, and the love of her life that both inspired her to become an actress, but also haunted her for the rest of her days.
In the telling of the tale, flashbacks are used extensively, many times in such a way that it's hard to tell what is an actual memory and what may have come from the actresses movie roles. In the course of relating the story, the filmmaker continues to appear in the story, probably caused by his prompting in order to both get her story, and show his support for a woman he obviously loves. The ultimate result is a tale of undying love that is both sad, and yet hauntingly beautiful.
As to the technical aspects of the feature, I have no complaints at all. The quality of this production is excellent, especially in character animation and music. My particular copy didn't have an English translation, but reading the subtitles was not a problem.
In the end, what I can tell you about this picture is that it's both an interesting view of history, and a striking tale of a young life and the way ones past affects the future. There is ultimately no great happy ending here, but that said, it's an interesting way to spend and hour and a half.",1295049600,,1520,4.490974729241877
1908039,4,B0000AK80C,"`Millennium Actress' is an unusual film, with a unique storyline and with stunning animation. Chiyoko is an actress recounting her life story to a film crew and as she tells it, the films she has starred in and her real life become intertwined. The film crew go back in time with her as she acts in various films and searches for a lost love. This can get quite confusing at times, but once you get your head around the premise this makes for a unique and original style of film making. The animation is wonderful and is all the better for being hand drawn rather than the CGI pieces so often produced these days. The soundtrack compliments the film perfectly and the director deliberately requested this respected composer to work on this film for him and it is a stronger film when the soundtrack is coupled with the animation on screen. There is a `making of' feature as an extra on this disc which gives a deeper insight into the film and shows how the film developed. This is definitely a film that will get better with repeated viewings and whilst that first viewing may leave you mildly baffled, when you come to it again you will appreciate it for it's depth and beauty. Definitely a required DVD for your anime collection.

1908040,4,B0000AK80C,"I found the watching of Millennium Actress to be most enjoyable. You follow a actor by the name of Chiyoko through her life, most of the story is intermixed with her real life and that of her stage life, with both having similarities to one another, from my understanding her stage life used some or many of her real life events to produce movies. (Atleast that is how it appears)

Overall the movie is an interesting watch, the animation style is done well, using more of a realistic look and feel rather than a cartoony approach and the voice actors portray their emotions well. The sound track is done well, not to over the top, but it's there when it needs to be.

Some people might find it hard to differentiated between ""Real life"" and ""Stage life"" it's a lot like Perfect Blue in that regards, but less than the previous one by far. It will probably take a second watching for viewers to truly understand which one is which atleast in the very beginning anyway, but the key to it is looking at what the characters are wearing, if it's ""Old"" style, it's the movie, if it's more of a post/pre world war Japan look it's more than likely ""Real Life"". (Though towards the end we do get into more modern Japan, but they try to help off set that by ""cutting"" when the actors are done so that one can see that they were on a stage.)

The ending may leave some confused as well, especially those not used to the way Japanese tend to tell stories, I shouldn't say confused but rather dis-enhearted? Maybe that's the right word for it. Don't expect a Disney fairy tale ending in the least.

Some may find the following of the camera man and the other man a little odd, but keep in mind they are doing a documentary of her life through it all, so in truth they are ""acting"" out her life experiences with her as she recounts them and instead of watching them play act we get to go back and re-live it as it would have happened.

A warning and a tip, this movie is JAPANESE ONLY, there are NO ENGLISH voice actors, so you have to read subs through it all, if that is not something you like than I suggest you look else where for movies. For the most part the subs don't go by to fast, and for me who can read ""Medium"" speed I can keep up with it.

All in all I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a slightly fast paced movie that has some good laughs at the expense of one of the men and the camera man. It's got action in it for the first half of the film; as we are set in the olden days Japan. But it's mainly centered around Chiyoko finding the guy she knew as a child, so it's got romance in it, and drama (lots of that). There is no Nudity or swearing really also no sex, so it's pretty clean in that regards and it's not really a bloody movie either.

I give it 4 out of 5 because I would have personally liked to see more done with the man she's chasing after.",1294531200,,2861,4.172101449275362
1908041,5,B0000AK80C,"It's really sad when one thinks that the incredible director that was Kon Satoshi only made 4 films and 1 TV anime. Of his films(Perfect Blue, Tokyo Godfathers, Paprika and Millennium Actress) Millennium Actress is easily his best. The movie is about an actress named Fujiwara Chiyoko who at one point in her life was a very prolific actress but disappeared from movies never to be heard from again.

Many years later Tachibana Genya finally tracks her down and gets a interview. Genya also happens to be Chiyoko's biggest fan and cherishes this moment. As she tells him the story of her life both Genya and his Cameraman find themselves reliving her life in person. To them it becomes more then a story.

Throughout the movie the viewer sees why Chiyoko got into movies and how no matter the movie she was doing her character seemed to be part of herself. There are times when the memories and movies begin to blur and the viewer is left wondering if what just happened was one of her movies or one of her memories or perhaps both.

Now I'm not a professional reviewer so I won't go deeper into the plot or it's complexity and the messages it has. What I can tell you is that it's one incredible film everyone should see. After the death of Kon Satoshi it seems to be a perfect way to put yourself at peace with it.(if you happen to know what his death means to alot of people like myself) In many ways Kon's career mirrored Chiyoko's.",1286755200,,1436,4.473282442748092
1908042,5,B0000AK80C,With the recent passing of Satoshi Kon which was a great loss I went back to select my favorite feature and the winner hands down was Millennial Actress. One word of warning-there is a version which has an english dub-you need to get the R2 PAL British dvd. The dub is quite good+it has both english and japanese DTS soundtracks-just make sure your dvd player can handle it.,1284595200,,374,4.514705882352941
1908043,5,B0000AK80C,"The story of the film is done in the style of a ""play within a play.""  Genya Tachibana is working on a documentary about a famous actress named Chiyoko Fujiwara.  Chiyoko is an elderly actress who has withdrawn from public life.  As Genya talks with Chiyoko, we see the story of her life from her teenage years to being a middle aged superstar.  The flashbacks that appear are interspersed with segments from Chiyoko's films.  While Chiyoko's life takes place surrounding World War II, the characters in her films span from the Sengoku period to a futuristic space age.

One of the big elements of the story has to do with a dissident artist that Chiyoko helped to escape from the military.  She became attracted to him, but he had to flee.  However, he left behind a key to his suitcase, and Chiyoko wants to find him.  She initially became an actress in order to have the opportunities to travel and to try to find him.  Over the course of the story, we learn that Genya was actually part of Chiyoko's past, although she doesn't realize it right at first.

The execution of the story is very well-done, although there are a lot of layers to the storytelling.  You really have to watch it more than once in order to pick up on details that you may have missed the first time you watch it.  While there's nothing visually that would be unacceptable to younger viewers, I think the execution of the storytelling of the film would be rather confusing to them.  I would personally recommend this film to anime viewers who are fifteen or sixteen years of age and older.

There are two special features on the DVD.  The first is a forty minute documentary about the making of Millennium Actress.  The documentary is in Japanese with English subtitles.  The narration is done by the voice actor for Genya.  Over the course of the documentary, interviews are included from Satoshi Kon, several members of the production team, and all three voice actresses for Chiyoko.  The other extra is a trailer for Millennium Actress that is slightly over a minute long.  This trailer is in English to promote Dreamworks' release of the film.

Millennium Actress is a very well-done anime film, and it has become a classic.  I would personally recommend this DVD for anyone who considers themselves as a fan of Satoshi Kon's work or as a fan of anime in general.

1908045,5,B0000AK80C,"Narratively and emotionally complex, Millennium Actress is nevertheless wonderfully accessible - a supreme example of how an artist can harness the qualities made available through film and animation and make something beautiful and meaningful out them.

The story is simple and at the same time ambitious. A documentary filmmaker interviews the legendary Japanese actress Chiyoko Fujiwara. Now a 70 year old lady, Chiyoko's career has nevertheless spanned a millennium from period drama to science-fiction drama - but it's a single incident from her childhood that serves as a common thread through all her films and is also the key (literally as well as figuratively) inspiration that makes those performances so great.

The animation then is fully put to the service of the story, Chiyoko's real-life and the documentary filmmakers all coming together into the landscape of her filmmaking career, the animation fluidly blending between them all, serving to add subtle emotional resonances - and sometimes not quite so subtle it must be admitted, but perfectly in tune nonetheless with the dramatic nature of the subject. In this way, Millennium Actress becomes a tribute not only to Japanese cinema, but to the nature of cinema as a whole, to the necessity of drama and the creation of fiction to make lives all the more vivid and meaningful.

Millennium Actress is the type of movie that you have to sit through the whole movie to appreciate.  The way the story is told takes a little getting used to, but it is a very innovative way of telling a story.  A movie studio is being torn down, and a movie producer, Tachibana, has been granted an interview with the studio's greatest star, Chiyoko, who has been in seclusion for the past 30 years.  As she tells her story, you get a history of Japan via the actress' roles in jidaigeki (historical period movies).  Her movie roles and personal life are intertwined as she searches for the love of her life. Millennium Actress does what Japanese cinema, historically, does so well: the story of the tragic romance.

Objectively, the story-telling itself is admirable.  We learn about the characters incrementally, and tag along with her on her ""journey"" just like the way Tachibana does when as he interviews her.  At the end, everything comes together.

Subjectively, how well you like the movie will just depend on how you react towards the characters. Some will be enthralled as the movie goes forward. Some, like me, will appreciate the story and characters more after watching it than while watching it. And some will really not bond with the characters and situation at all.",1267315200,2,1541,4.712686567164179
1908048,4,B0000AK80C,"Read this review if you're trying to decide whether to get this movie without having someone tell you so much about it that it ruins all the surprises.

I just watched this with my very intelligent--and rather conservative--spouse, a very smart engineer friend from India who doesn't think much of anime, and an intellectual Russian friend who's pretty knowledgeable about movies.

The engineer fell asleep--thought it was a crashing bore and a complete waste of time. My wife found it annoying, due to a tendency in Japanese films for what people of northern European descent would consider overacting/overemotionalism. The Russian Jewish film buff and I found it both fascinating and touching.

So--which response would you have? I'll try to help.

1. The film's structure is complex, and is constructed rather the way a classical symphony is constructed. It's a narrative, but one that loops back in on itself, revisiting leitmotifs throughout, and ending in a way that, say, a Mahler or Brahms fan would find very satisfying. However, someone who wants straight ahead storytelling, with a clear sense of what is actually happening at any given moment, may get lost here and there. I didn't, but I'm a serious film buff. Few filmmaking tricks surprise me any more. This did.

If you liked ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or ""Being John Malkovich"" or Carlos Saura's ""Carmen"" those might be clues to you liking. However, my wife like two of these a lot and didn't like ""Millenium Actress.""

The real clincher would be if you've seen a bunch of Japanese movies made in the 1950s, 60s and early 70s--because, paralleling the story of the central characters is a loving homage to both Japan's history and to that golden era of Japanese films, whose tropes and styles appear in this, somewhat ""Zelig"" style.

My wife thought it jumped around in Japanese history, but it's more accurate to say that it jumped around the different genres of Japanese filmmaking in the postwar era--the samurai films (divided into a bunch of subcategories), realistic modern films, and sci fi, from domestic dramas to war films.

A lot of the time what's happening onscreen seems to shimmer magically between the characters' own stories and the stories of the films they're talking/thinking about.

2. Another aspect is that the central personal theme is unrequited love, which is the romanticism of a young teenager--so if you find ""Romeo and Juliet"" and all those films young teenage girls swoon at nothing but annoying, that might be a counter-indicator for this film.

It's important to add that this film's PG rating might mislead you into thinking kids could see it. But it's only subtitled--not dubbed--and I think its complex musical structuring and the need for you to know something about Japanese history and film history would cut out many young teens who might love wonderful Japanese animes like ""Spirited Away.""

3. By ""knowing something about Japanese history"" I mean it helps a lot to recognize from people's makeup and costumes whether you're seeing, say, Heian era or Tokugawa era or Meiji era costume drama. Maybe that's not absolutely required, but I think that's part of why my Indian engineer friend thought it was a stupid jumble of stuff.

So here's the trick: emotionally, at its core this film is no more complex than ""Bolt,"" the delightful American animated 3D feature my wife and I saw and loved last year. But cinematically this film is up there with some really sophisticated films. So if you just look at the character and quests of the central characters you might dismiss this as a kids' film only.

From my point of view I figure we were all kids once, so I'm OK with seeing something from that simpler perspective as long as there are other things to keep my mind engaged. This did so fully, and I'm very glad I saw it.

But if you haven't seen ""Rashomon,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" ""Sansho the Bailiff,"" and a bunch of other Japanese Golden Era classics--the kind that get put out under the Criterion imprint--maybe you should see those first. You'll appreciate this more if you do.

I only had one real gripe about the film, but I'm probably wrong about this. In a scene on the Moon, the heroine moves around as if she's moving in Earth gravity, instead of that skippy hoppy thing real astronauts on the Moon do. OTOH in Japanese live-action sci-fi films I'm sure they moved just the way the heroine did. That's why my gripe is probably wrong, since it's not about landing on the moon--it's about movies about landing on the moon.

My Russian Jewish friend doesn't know but a tiny fraction of what I know about Japanese history and cinema, yet she enjoyed it. Therefore the caution I just expressed about needing to know Japanese history and cinema may not be necessary. Maybe what's in the film is enough to guide you. I am sure that the more you know about Japanese history and cinema the more you'll enjoy this, though.

I'm fine with Euro-restrained cinema too. See my review of ""Let the Right One In"" for an example. But though I'm no fan of unrequited love, and some of my favorite actresses are Helen Mirren and Judy Densch, neither of whom ever act like Chiyoko in this film, I still enjoyed this thoroughly.

BTW the main character reminded me slightly of Ingrid Bergman--think Casablanca. That, too, is about unrequited love in ways strongly reminiscent of this film, though visually there's very little connections. From Japanese films of the 50s this made me think of Machiko Kyo, though she could express an earthiness we never see in Chiyoko. Besides Bergman I also thought of Greer Garson and Shirley Jones and other ""good girl"" heroines of our own cinematic golden age (even when they played prostitutes!).

One other note--the streets and vehicles and clothing styles of every era shown are all accurate and detailed. The filmmaker did his homework.

Lastly, I've seen another animated film by Satoshi Kon, ""Tokyo Godfathers,"" which you might want to see first. It's set squarely in contemporary Tokyo, is emotionally rich and complex, but told in a pretty straightforward narrative form. I really liked this film as interesting cinema but also as powerfully engaging emotionally--somewhat more than ""Millenium Actress,"" though I was moved by the latter.

1908049,4,B0000AK80C,"From director Satoshi Kon is this bittersweet look at the life of a Japanese actress, as her history and past roles blend together into a compelling story. Kon is mostly known for doing psychological titles like Perfect Blue, Paranoia Agent, and Paprika. However, despite bending the laws of reality as much in his other works, this one reaches out on a sentimental level.

Starting off in modern day, Genya is a director making a documentary on the demolishing of a famous Japanese movie studio, and interviews the belle of the movie set, Chiyoko Fujiwara, who is now a reclusive elderly lady. She recalls when she was a young girl and scouted by an up-and-coming movie director to be his latest star. Before her mother consents to her taking up a movie career, Chiyoko befriends a handsome artist who is on the run from the government for being an activist. He gives her a key and promises to see her again sometime. Chiyoko then sets out to be an actress mainly in the hope to find him somewhere while travelling Japan from set to set. While she conveys the details of her search during the interview, it begins to incorporate parts she played in various movies. She goes from being a samurai princess, a ninja, a geisha, and more, all the while only running into the artist once while he's still on the run, and is finally confronted by an officer who has been ""Zenigataing"" him this whole time. She later learns from him that the artist was captured and tortured to death. Chiyoko then goes on a long running sequence(one of film's several ones)which leads to her remembering her last role as an astronaut who continues to pursue her true love even into the stars. In reality though, she passes away of old age, but reaches a final sense of conclusion when Genya returns her key to her that had been missing for decades.

Satoshi Kon delivers a finely animated production with this, while catering to the rich history of Japanese cinema. It might get a little confusing when they're going from parts of Chiyoko's life to her in one of her movies, plus having Genya and his camerman becoming integrated into them too. Aside from the somewhat dramatic overtones in it, there is also some exceptional comedy. Sony Pictures released this on DVD in the U.S. with only a Japanese track on it, probably due to the fact that the film caters alot more to otaku and those familiar with Japanese culture than your average American, however it's still an appealing film and worth checking out.",1262304000,,2486,4.68649885583524

1908051,5,B0000AK80C,"i've heard of this movie and seen it on and off for several years, but the clips i'd seen and the description turned me off so i didn't watch it, though i'd heard good things about it. after seeing it however, i don't know why i waited so long! the movie is about two guys who want to interview a famous actress for the documentary they're doing on her life, and the movies she was in are used to tell the story of her love for a man she doesn't really know. this sounded extremely boring to me, and the pacing of the movie isn't fast and exciting, but more of a slower building up to the climax, so if one were to fast forward through to see segments of various scenes... well it just looked boring. but, the movie is actually really good.

first of all, the art is amazing. a lot of attention paid to detail and it's a pleasure to watch purely from an artistic perspective.

so the story is about two guys who interview a famous actress about her life, and she tells this story through movies she's been in. basically when she was young she met a wounded rebel in the streets and hides him from the police for a night. when she goes to see him in the morning he's gone but he left a picture of her that he drew saying something like 'until next time'. so she sort of falls for this man and then obsesses over him for the rest of her life. she gets an offer to be an actress and accepts because the job she was offered took her to where the guys escaped to. so we find out that her success as an actress stems from her desire to find this guy. and this sounds superficial and weak as a motivation to do something with your life, kind of playing off the stereotype that a woman needs a man to complete herself, which is why i like this movie so much. when a typical north amercian thinks of japanese culture, or for some people asian culture in general, they think of the stereotypes of weak- willed, submissive women because of how the media portrays them and such, but this movie subtly twists that stereotype on its head. the girl spends her entire life chasing after this guy and many parts in the movie you wonder why she doesn't just give up on the guy and live her life for herself. at the end of the movie though ... i guess spoiler alert but if i'd known this sooner i'd have watched it sooner... she tells the interviewer that it didn't matter to her if she ever actually caught up with the guy, in fact if she did catch him she would probably get bored of him because it was the chasing that she lived for. and this is like anything in life, if you chase a man o a job or even an ideology of some kind, the journey is the important thing, meaning that she is living for herself. and that made the movie for me. it twisted the stereotype of japanese women western people have. so i liked it.",1259798400,,2801,4.156537753222836

1908056,5,B0000AK80C,"It was after being exposed to such films as 'Princess Mononoke' and 'Spirited Away' that I went to a local retailer for what I hoped would be more of the same.  This was several years ago, but then, as now, the selection of Anime feature films that are not lifted directly from a television series are few and far between, which is unfortunate, since this genre offers a unique method of storytelling which could be awkward and unappealing, if not impossible, in a live action effort.  Unfortunate too are the chances that any full length independent feature, at least what is offered to Western viewers, will tread on similar ground as those that have come before.

Thankfully, then, we have such films as 'Millenium Actress' and a few others which do not slip neatly into the commonly perceived boundries of this genre, and, to me, hold their own against any other type of film.  At heart a dual story of unrequited and unrealized love, I felt it rose above even that catagorization to touch on some deeper, more subtle themes, and in a manner reminiscent of classical literature coupled with complex technique and plain old fashioned movie fun.

The fabled Genei Studios (a stand in for Toho Studios) is in the process of being torn down.  A documentarian, Genya, and his cameraman, Kyoji, track down the face of Genei Studios, the legendary actress Chiyoko Fujiwara, who has lived in seclusion several years after making her last film.  Now in her 70's, the still elegant Chiyoko has granted Genya an interview in return for a memento he has brought her from her studio days.

As Chiyoko tells the story of her life for the documentary, a curious blend of fact and fantasy and memory begins.  At first, it has all the trappings of a normal flashback, except to the surprise of Genya and his cameraman, the power of the memory is so strong that it incorporates them into the story as well, and, initially at least, they are passive observers to events 60 years old.  Here they watch as Chiyoko, a pre-adolescent girl during the years before WWII, meets and then assists and then falls in love with an anti-government agitator - a painter, wounded, and on the run from the authorities.  Although she tries to help, the police close in and the painter is forced to flee.

At this point, Chiyoko's memory merges into film history - excerpts from her earliest film role, as explained by Genya to his cameraman while they watch, parallel her life's events.  Obsessed with her painter, Chiyoko begins her career as an actress simply as a way to chase after him, first to Manchuria, and then skipping across the country, always a step behind.  Interspersed with her history are scenes from films (always with Genya and Kyoji tagging along), which also feature a heroine in search of her love.  Genya takes a more and more active role in her memories and in the film excerpts, and slowly it becomes apparent that Genya has been chasing Chiyoko almost as long as she had been chasing her painter.

Some viewers may find 'Millenium Actress' confusing at first - I did.  Like most anime films, there is not a lot of explanation prior to engulfing the audience in its own quirky universe.  Real world events blend into personal history which in turns fades into popular film that is then hijacked by the kind-hearted Genya as he tries to help his actress in any way that he can.  He and his cameraman ricochet (often comically so) from Kurosawa type samurai films to Godzilla to dynastic period films as they follow Chiyoko as she in turn trails after her painter to the very limits of imagination.  What catapults this film out of the strictly romantic and into another far subtler realm of human obsession are the last words of the film, spoken as Chiyoko begins her final journey.

This effort was in part a Dreamworks production, though what degree of infuence they may have had is difficult to know.  The film has a thorough authentic feel to it, and in the extra 'making-of' segment, it's apparent that all the principal players were Japanese.  Some may not appreciate the lack of an English sound track, but I do not feel that this detracted from the movie at all.

Aside from the storyline, the animation in this effort far exceeds the director's previous film 'Perfect Blue' (In my opinion, everything about 'Millenium Actress' exceeds 'Perfect Blue').  The only drawback that I noticed was the music, which I felt was to cloying, and that it interfered more than helped.

Very enjoyable, though, and highly recommended to fans of all film.",1235520000,2,4540,4.736975857687421
1908057,4,B0000AK80C,"When a documentary filmmaker gains an interview with a reclusive actress, he is treated to a great love story.  As a young girl, Chiyoko Fujiwara fell in love with a dissident artist during the time of fascist military rule in the 30s.  She spent the rest of her life searching for him.  As she tells this story to the interviewer and his cameraman, it is interspersed with scenes from her films in which she is always seeking reunion with an absent lover.  To add yet another layer, the interviewer himself has always harbored a secret passion for the actress and appears as her protector in many of these scenes.

This fascinating movie produces an effect that is difficult to put into words.  The inclusion of so many film scenes in lieu of flashbacks elevates Chiyoko's story above the particular circumstances of a single human life, giving it the iconic power inherent in great films, so that it seems that she suffers and loves on behalf of us all.  And isn't that, in a sense, what movies and the actors who appear in them mean to those who really love them?  The extraordinary animation does full justice to this ambitious conceit.",1223683200,,1140,4.665

In this movie he shows the life on an actress through her movies, showing what moved her to become an actress and lead her from one movie to another; he shows that there is more than simple motives for what we do, and that somethimes we don't realize how deep impact our desicions have in our lives, and how life goes on so quick, becomes a great adventure, and finally comes to a conclusion, and maybe, only in the end we get to understand most of our steps along the way.

We meet Chioyoko Fujiwara(the actress) as an elderly woman and travel bakwards into her past as she gives an extreemly rare enterview to enamored journalist Genya Tachibana, who has also come to return to Chioyoko a most precious object.

The viewer is submersed in Chioyoko's memories. we witness the chance meeting in her girlhood that would drive her future. We watch as she is ""Discovered"" and begins her career Hoping that as she travels from location to location she will be reunited with the mysterious stranger who has touched her heart, and return to him the treassured key that he left in her keeping.

For Chioyoko acting is a means to an end, but the longing in her soul is relflected by the films she chooses. A career filled with haunting romantic dramas mix with her memories of unrequited love. It becomes clear that Chioyoko can no longer distinguish between the two. The ending is sad but touching and made all the more heart renching beause of the knowledge that Tachibana has carried for decades.

I""ve heard this film called depressing. it's very sad that's true but as the credits rolled I found myself uplifed by the sheer beauty of this film.",1190160000,,1356,4.684873949579832

Creative and often downright stunning in its imagery, the movie opts to take a meta-meta-meta-drama approach. Okay, I just put in an arbitrary number of ""metas"" but the point is that the plots of different movies are constantly being woven and blended into the flashback sequence that covers the main story. You'll realize that, yes, it's partly surreal, but at the same time it is not too difficult to pick up on ""what really happened.""

What it all comes down to is that it's hard to say why, but this is one of those profoundly Japanese animated films that really plays to the strengths of the medium while avoiding all the pitfalls that can turn off Westerners.",1180656000,,885,4.525

But one good thing about anime is that some of it makes you really think. This is one of those anime.

1908067,5,B0000AK80C,"One of my big resolutions for 2007 is to travel through time more. But when I rented ""Millenium Actress"", I had no idea that that was what I would be doing. I merely knew that I was renting a film by Satoshi Kon, and that although his first opus, ""Perfect Blue"", had left me rather cold, I consider his ""Tokyo Godfathers"" one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.

But travel through time I did. ""Millenium Actress"" is a biographical film about a fictitious but incredibly attractive Japanese movie star (even at 60!), who gets to be interviewed by a life-long admirer turned journalist. As the audience discovers, her life simply summarizes one century of Japanese cinema (from silents to ""Godzilla""), and her movies themselves, a thousand years of Japanese history (hence the title.)

""Millenium Actress"" is a film that wraps the viewer into its perfectly imagined little world from the very first image and never lets him go. In fact, I was so immediately entranced by it that I realized I wanted it to end rapidly, afraid as I was that it might fail to fulfil its promise, and utimately lose momentum. But this obvious labour of love (from all parties involved) does manage to sustain to the end that unique combination of sweet and sour nostalgia, hopeless but ever hopeful romanticism, deliberately clicheed melodrama and occasionally overblown humour.

My only regret is renting the film rather than buying it with my eyes closed. I will not make the same mistake when Paprika is released on DVD.",1170460800,2,1511,4.803846153846154

I found the first thirty minutes confusing and slow.  I had a hard time distinguishing life-flashbacks and older movie sequences.  The woodgrains in the background added subtle overtones into the emotional mixtures, but I noticed them because the story totally dragged.

According to the extras, Kon's intended the movie as a story stereogram.  A stereogram is an object that resembles different objects depending on your mindset and interpretation.  My opinion is the director went too far, adding non-linear elements to a point where the story itself became unclear.

If you are a sophisticated cinema lover, you'll enjoy this movie immensely.  If you wanted to watch an entertaining anime after a mentally taxing day at work, look elsewhere.  The mystery never wrenched me because it could also be a bedtime story.  The suspense never scared me because it could also be romance.  The adventure never thrilled me because it was always a flashback.  My problem with the stereogrammatic approach was the opacity took away purity.

Overall I felt unmoved at the end. Reminded me of completing a crossword in the newspaper -- slight satisfaction for comprehending a self-appointed puzzle.  I could appreciate the methaphors, animation sequences, and visuals, but not the story.",1162425600,9,1385,5.208144796380091
1908070,3,B0000AK80C,"Millennium Actress (Satoshi Kon, 2001)

I've been trying to figure out what to say about Millennium Actress for over a week now. I still haven't come up with much. It's a good movie, though a confusing one at times. Full of the depth of character one expects from the top Japanese directors of animation, well-plotted if a bit threadbare in places. In other words, good, but could've been better.

The story centers on Chiyoko Fujiwara, a retired actress tracked down by a reporter, Genya Tachibana, and Genya's cameraman Eiko soon after the studio where she rose to fame was torn down. Genya and Chiyoko talk, both reliving the most famous scenes in her movies and putting together the tale of the things that happened in between, as Chiyoko pursued her first love, an anonymous man who had given her a key when she was younger.

The first fifteen or twenty minutes, pay very very close attention-- and even then, you may miss a time shift or two. Once you get used to the way things go back and forth in time, though, the movie gets much easier to follow, and you can spend your time getting to know the characters. Things just keep going after that, with the plot really taking a backseat to the character-building; this makes the end of the movie work perfectly. It's quite an enjoyable little movie, really, and worth watching. *** ",1160956800,15,1337,4.6525423728813555
1908071,5,B0000AK80C,"The story of the great Japanese actress Chiyoko is a very moving and interesting one. She is a kind of ""everyman"" - all things to all people and a real hero, too.

The story is told in a rather interesting and unusual way - like a documentary, with the journalists actually ending up in Chiyoko's films, which trace both her own life and the story of Japanese over several hundred years.

Millennium Actress is a film so rich in layers and images it is almost too much to take in in one viewing. The beauty of the DVD is that one can watch it chapter by chapter over an extended period.

I like to watch this film in Japanese with English subtitles, but the version released in Australia has an excellent English voice option.

This is an animation, but it is really a sophisticated and adult film - I can't imagine many young children will enjoy this film.

Needless to say, some bright and enthusiastic young dude in Hollywood will probably try to make a version of this film with live actors. I hope not.",1155686400,5,1007,4.421621621621622

And although the hentai films are quite ""amusing"" they really serve a different function than what I usually look for in a movie.  Thus I was very pleased at how amazing this film was.  Millenium Actress feels like a normal movie that just happens to be animated.  I won't go into all the details of the plot, but I will just comment that the plot was excellent, very adult but not ""adult"", the characters were good, and of course the visual elements were astounding.  This movie doesn't have the Disney-esque feel that movies like Steamboy (which I didn't care for), in fact it felt more like watching an Oscar worthy picture.

The visuals are stunning, the story's presentation is freaky at times (which is exactly what the director - the same from Perfect Blue - is a master at), yet doesn't carry the same ""scary"" feel to it as does Perfect Blue. One of the greatest things about this film is that it is extremely realistic. The story is just absolutely amazing, and the ending will probably have you crying.

It isn't so often that an original film as powerful as this comes out. As some know who have read my review of Tokyo Godfathers, I disliked that film simply because it failed to be as original as it presented itself... this movie /is/ truly original.

Having just seen Perfect Blue which was a departure from form for the genre, I approached Millennium Actress somewhat warily.  Like the prior film, this beautiful anime steps away from the historical mecha, monster, sci-fi anime breeding ground and tells a story simply with stylized visuals.  The story involves a dedicated fan of a famous Japanese actress who seeks her out when she's in her 70's.  She recounts the events of her life in documentary form and we are whisked along with her through her movies and her personal experiences.  This includes her lifelong quest for her first and true love.

Sometimes funny, sometimes painful, always drawing you deeper in, this anime is truly a masterpeice.  Sublime, yet raw in emotions and amazing in how much it pulls out of the watcher.

The plot is one actress's search for her first love.  A mixture of the past and the present, fantasy and fate, art and magic.

Few anime, or films, make me cry near the end.  The anime -Grave Of The Fireflies- and the Chinese film -Not One Less- are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head that have generated such emotions.  Powerful.  Wonderful.  Tragic, yet not truly sad in the end.

* Great animation and graphics (award winning)!!!

* The storyline is twisted as Perfect Blue but not THAT twisted.

* Is hard to understand the story at the beginning but then the story turns more comprehensible.

* There is one action scene but it was SOOOOOO COOL!!!!!!!

* The scenes of samurai drama were the most AWESOME and MEMORABLE scenes I ever seen in anime since Samurai X (the first two OVA episodes, NOT the TV series).

* Belive me!! Millenniun Actress is everything that Perfect Blue should be in the first place. I dind't like Perfect Blue because it was soo boring, TWISTED storyline (it gave me the biggest hedache I ever felt) and the story was not to good.

1908084,5,B0000AK80C,"Now THIS is a hard movie to put into words.  I can easily apply words like excellent, beautiful, mind-blowing, multi-layered and stunning, but that merely conveys my personal rabid enthusiasm for ""Millennium Actress"".  The first ten minutes or so are easy enough to describe - a pair of filmakers set out to profile and interview a famous Japanese actress who's lived as a recluse for many years, having disappeared from public life at the height of her career.  From there the territory it heads into is among the most open-to-interpretation, the most moving, and (in my opinion) the most metaphysical plot ambiguities and mesmerizations ever captured on film.  Ten people could watch this and come up with ten different takes on the movie, ranging from the mundane (as in worldly and rational, NOT dull) to the whimsical to the terrifyingly dark or to the dreamlike, or any combination thereof.  I and the ones I saw this with came up with similar interpretations, but that could be due to our similar ways of thinking.  Someone with a different worldview or imagination or set of beliefs might come up with a vastly different, but no less valid, way of interpreting it.  There are no 'wrongs' in interpreting a movie and what each individual gets out of it.  I still cling to hopes of someday publishing some of the stories floating around in my head, and if I'm fortunate enough to do so, some readers may get quite different takes on it than what I had in mind, and that's not wrong, it's just different.

  One thing I can say about ""Millennium Actress"" is that it has some of the most realistic animation I've ever seen.  Not realistic in the same sense as ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" of the firs segment in ""Animatrix"" where it looks nearly live-action (brilliantly so), but realistic in terms of body language, facial expressions, personal mannerisms, and so on.  And the subtitling job is dead-on flawless; if you're a viewer who usually avoids subtitled films, this could be a great introduction.

  In 2001, Millennium Actress split Japan's prestigious Agency of Cultural Affairs Media Arts Festifal Animation Grand Prize with the already-legendary ""Spirited Away"".  The 2 movies are very different, but Millennium Actress is 1000% worthy of tying ""Spirited"" as its full equal.  I can think of no higher praise to give this film.",1097539200,4,2349,4.888888888888889
1908085,4,B0000AK80C,"Millennium Actress is the third animated film I've seen by Satoshi Kon, director of ""Perfect Blue"" and ""Tokyo Godfathers."" This falls somewhere between the other two.

Like ""Perfect Blue,"" ""Millennium Actress"" explores the faceted nature of reality, in this case the fractured memory of an aging actress recalling her film career, interwoven with her lifelong obsession - the search for a political agitator she fell in love with as a young girl. It's often difficult to tell if scenes are excerpts from the actress' films, her memory, or dreams. Transitions between scenes are abrupt and very creative, adding to the dislocated quality that Satoshi Kon has mastered. He succeeds in creating a visual analogue for memory, with its elisions and unexpected leaps through time.

As in ""Tokyo Godfathers,"" the animation is lush and detailed. Satoshi Kon uses the main character's film career as a means to cut through large swaths of Japanese history, from feudal castles to bombed-out cities in World War II. The characters, costumes, buildings, and landscape are beautifully rendered, and the film is a visual feast from beginning to end.

But ""Millennium Actress"" lacks the emotional heart of ""Tokyo Godfathers."" Though the film's subject is overwrought passion, even the director seems a little uncomfortable with the ridiculous side of this unrequited love. He frames the love story by introducing an interviewer and cameraman who follow her through her memories, providing occasional comic relief; in my opinion the device is silly, although the interviewer's real love for the actress adds some emotional depth. Ultimately, as a story, the film is about lifelong self-indulgence and unwillingness to live in the present.

The whole story, and basically her whole life, revolves around her relentless search for a political refugee she met before he ran away.  It also spotlights some movies she starred in, and it's nearly impossible to tell what's real and what's not; often, what we're supposed to assume are true events in her life segue directly into what we're supposed to a assume is a movie.  Several elements in her life seem to be equally part of both worlds.  (For anyone not really familiar with anime, this movie is a lot like Big Fish in that fantasy and reality are not vaguely defined, and the timeline doubles back on itself.)

Also you will need to watch it multiple times to understand it so you also have to be a patient person. If you follow these steps then wow what a great superb film you will experience.

1908093,4,B0000AK80C,"Just beautiful. It's about a fictional actress named Chiyoko who has gone into seclusion for 30 years and a journalist who seeks her out for an interview to make a documnetary about her life.  As the 70-year old Chiyoko relates the story of her career, she ties it to the films she's made.  When she was a young girl in Japan just before the war, she ran into a man, a human rights activist/painter, whom she helped hide for a while.  He had a mysterious key with him, which he said would open ""the most important thing that there is.""  The film relates her search for this man, who then disappears from her life, and how it impacted her movie-making career.
 Stories within stories, a mix of fantasy and reality...there's a bit of ambiguity between what is real, what is the movie, and what is her story.  It's an inventive way to tell a pretty simple story about one girl's relentless pursuit of a man she fell in love with at first sight.
 At times I felt exhilirated, like I was coasting down the highway listening to music... on my way to meet someone.",1085875200,,1057,4.417525773195877
1908094,5,B0000AK80C,"This is something I haven't seen in a long time: a basically different kind of narrative.
Chiyoko was an actress, many years ago. Now, after she's been in retirement for decades, a former co-worker (Genya) interviews her about her life, her career, and the one mysterious strand that connects all the pieces together.
The story is told in scenes from her earlier life, mostly in fragments of the movies Chiyoko has made. Occasional cuts back to the present interview keep the story anchored, but the cinematic flashbacks really carry the narrative.
The unique aspect was that Genya and his camera-man find themselves transported into each flashback. When a scene from a remembered movie shows fire, they feel the heat. When another scene shows an attack by archers, the camera-man's sleeve is pinned to the wall. At first, the two are ghostlike observers, unable to interact with the scene. Gradually, however, Genya is pulled into the action; he now takes part in the movie-memory.
Saying more would be saying too much. There are many surprises in this movie, and I want you to enjoy them the way I did.
This anime meets very high technical standards, but competent animation is easy to find. The story and the style of the story-telling really carry this movie. There are layers to unravel, making this much more complex and nuanced than most animation. This almost never happens to me: as soon as the movie ended, I wanted to see it again.

At last she grants an interview to a documentary filmmaker, Genya Tachibana, who has been devoted to her since his youth as a gofer in her studio.  He returns to her a precious token: a key, given to her in her youth by a mysterious, hunted stranger she has devoted her heart and life to ever since, even though she can't find him.
The key opens her memories, and she, Tachibana, his cameraman, and us start on a journey that weaves between historical eras, places, and the border between reality and the fantasy world of her film career.  Tachibana even finds himself becoming a character in the movie of her memory.
Kon uses muted color and even black-and-white throughout as story elements.  I found myself as devoted to her as Tachibana was. A great movie.",1081641600,3,1018,4.702247191011236

My only beef with this DVD is, well the DVD. The features listed on the back of the cover mention a commentary by director/writer  Satoshi Kon. There is no commentary on this disc like there was on the Region 2 release. There is however a nice documentary on the film in the extras along with the U.S. trailer. The main problem with the disc comes in on the language set up. Picking either a subtitle or a audio takes you right back to the top menu which is a pain because you have to go back again if you want something else. It's just not a good menu.
But anyway, if you are prejudice against Japanese Animation, slap yourself and see this film. Anyone who has the least bit of interest in film will love this.",1079308800,,926,4.3526011560693645

I didn't find the story to be depressing although it is bittersweet.  The characters are so strongly drawn that halfway through I found myself forgetting they weren't real people!

It's a very cool tale of a retired reclusive actress and her films and her life and her experiences with a mysterious artist she meets as a teenager prior to the US involvement in WWii.
As she tells her story to the interviewer (who turns out... well, don't want to give to much away) he and his camera man get involved in the action in scenes of her movies and scenes of her life, which become interspersed and blend into each other (life and movie, movie and live). It's very cool and very unique, especially with the cameraman's reaction to everything.

1908103,5,B0000AK80C,"Normally, when a movie relies heavily on the use of flashbacks, it's a recipe for a boring movie, and quite often a confusing one. Not so here. Upon my first viewing of Millennium Actress, it stuck me not simply as anime, or an anime film, but more like something that you would catch a tv channel showing high-art films late at night. All of the elements of film that takes itself seriously are there.
In this film there are dramatic camera angles, amazing use of color, a striking film score, incredible dialog and perfect acting. In a normal film you would say that magic was captured by the camera. In this movie it was CRAFTED, because it is not live-action, but animation. Many reviews have talked about the brilliant exploration of the many film genres that this movie recreates (from samurai flicks to war films to sci-fi drama), and I have to say that the way this movei switches seemlessly from reality to flashback, and the way that fantasy and reality fuse together is nothing short of breath-taking. You could say that this movie manages to capture the true nature of memories. As time passes, memories change. And sometimes they run together and seem to happen at the same time. Was it a dream or was it real? That's the mystery, the reason why this movie is so fascinating.
Some have remarked that there was some flaw or other with the animation or soundtrack. All I can say in response is that the animation in this film is a work of art. Maybe you don't like it, but to call it flawed would be a terrible insult. The same thing goes with the soundtrack. Cheesy 80's style music?! I would call it more an awesome experimental soundtrack that highlights moments of drama perfectly.
Upon reflection there is no doubt in my mind. The Cat Returns was my favorite movie of the year, but this was definitely the best.",1076544000,4,1827,4.573170731707317

It is also a very complex story which may require several viewings to understand what was going on.  The main character, the then actress Chiyoko Fujiwara related how she, as a young teenager, was given a key by a mysterious painter. For the most of her life she journeyed through Japan's history using various period films she had acted in (such as being a  schoolgirl, peasant, Geisha, and so on) to illustrate her desperate search for the painter in order to return the key back to him.  Line between reality and fantasy became blurred and there are lots of twists down the path.  It was just amazing.  I love the style, wonderful animation and how the story unfolds, but like I said, it IS rather complex...already I've watched it twice just to figure out the true meaning of the key and Chiyoko's remark at the very end of the film.  highly recommand it to any serious anime fans, as well and everyone else who might enjoy it.",1074729600,12,1026,4.543478260869565
1908107,5,B0000AK80C,"Last night a friend of mine gave me the movie Millennium Actress, which we watched. It's an anime movie from last year by Kon Satoshi, the writer/director of Perfect Blue, which is famous apparently, but which I've never seen. In contrast, Millennium Actress is not that famous in Japan, nor did it make even a whisper when it was released in a whopping six theatres across the United States. I guess unless it's a Miyazaki film released under the Disney name, anime still isn't going to get any notice in America, unsurprisingly.
Anyhow, I'm not a big anime fan, so I had never heard of this movie, and wasn't all that excited about it from the title. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised. If you don't know, the story is about a documentary being made about an actress who, as a child in War-era Japan, ran into an anti-government man in the street. He gives her a key to ""the most important thing in the world"" and she promises to meet him the next day to tell him what she thinks it's to, but by then he's disappeared. However, she insists on keeping her promise. Therefore, when the opportunity to go to Manchuria, where the man said he was going, arises in the form of an acting job, she takes it.
Anyhow, the story is okay, but not great, up to this point. It starts getting interesting when the movie shifts from talking directly about her life to shifting into scenes from her movies. The time period and costumes and everything changes suddenly and so forth. It gets progressively more common as the movie continues, the documentary crew becoming a part of it, jumping from Heian era Japan to the Ronin-filled warring states period to World War II. It's got a lot of references to famous Japanese period films in it (If you miss the reference to Kurosawa, you're just out of it!), which is one of the things that I really liked about it, since I'm a Japanese film buff of sorts. The music was neat, also, and meshed with the film quite well, the film becoming very stylish at moments when the music gets good so as to avoid drowning it out with story.
The story itself does not change that much, but instead of focusing on that, you get caught up in the various scenes jumping around throughout Japanese history, and the search for the man who gave her the key is a good excuse for it. The story, overall, is very melodramatic (typical of Japanese drama), but not trite, so I think it was good. However, like many overly stylish films, the story isn't as important as the look, sound and feel of the film, so having an excessively detailed or complex story wouldn't have worked as well anyways.
I enjoyed the movie a great deal, which is surprising because it was so overly dramatic at times and was in a medium I already take with a grain of salt (anime). However, these features that I would usually dislike were made into very positive parts of it thanks to the style of the film, and increased my enjoyment of it. I recommend it to anyone, not just anime fans.",1074556800,4,2976,4.492619926199262
1908108,3,B0000AK80C,"By reading and watching I think I got what was going on, but I suspect alot of the movie is lost on those of us who don't understand japanese.

1908109,5,B0000AK80C,"The term ""anime"" immediately invokes feelings of disgust in a good number of American filmviewers, usually due to it's immediate association with the great bulk of mindless sci-fi and fantasy drivel that makes it to the States (see: Pokemon, Sailor Moon, etc.) and the fact that most people simply think cartoons are for kids.  For the most part, they're right -- I'm certainly not going to sit here and laud the mature, artistic merits of Hand Maid May, for example -- but rightfully acclaimed director Satoshi Kon is the exception that proves the rule.  Perfect Blue, his first film to make it across the Pacific, set new standards for both animation and screenwriting with it's elaborate, psychedelic, and very adult spiral into schizophrenia.  Now, Millennium Actress continues his motif of the mind as a gateway to fantastic, non-linear timelines.  It begins when Genya Tachibana, the director of a documentary commemorating a famous movie studio, seeks out Chiyoko Fujiwara, a legendary actress who disappeared from the studio some 30 years previous.  With his reluctant, ascerbic cameraman in tow, Genya gains the now-elderly Chiyoko's confidence by presenting her with a literal key to her past.  As their interview progresses, the trio travels through Chiyoko's life story, where her movie roles and experiences weave an impossible thousand-year tale of love and commitment -- for Chiyoko and Genya alike.  Sometimes Millennium Actress swings the viewer from heart-wrenching drama to hilarious comic relief (and back) fast enough to leave psychic whiplash; at other times, Chiyoko's particular blend of memoirs and memories cloud the path to her resolution in a haze of geriatric senility -- but this beautifully animated film always keeps just enough grounded in reality to develop a compelling, coherrent, compassionate story.  Millenium Actress is a tribute to the possibilties that Japanimation holds as a cultural artform, and is a terrific sophomore offering from Satoshi Kon.

1908111,5,B0000AK80C,"""Millennium Actress"" does what every good animation should do.  It takes a good look at the medium, and puts forth a story that utilizes the unique strengths of animation, making a film that could not be live-action.  This is a master at work.
Both intellectual and emotional, the story is profound and touching, deep with sorrow and hope and unspoken, unrequited love that lasts throughout the years of a lifetime.  The two main stories are Chioyoko, desperately seeking the love of her childhood across the years, a man who gave her a key to ""the most important thing"" and Genya, the journalist interviewing Chioyoko about her life, and who also has carried a secret, powerful love for most of his lifetime.
Drifting across Chioyoko's lifetime as an actress, the story fades in and out of her movies, blending seamlessly fantasy and reality, past, present and future.  The technique is amazing, as is the journey through Japan's history as Chioyoko makes various period films, becoming schoolgirl, peasant, Geisha, prostitute, Samurai princess and astronaut.  Always she is seeking the man she knew as a child, and every role is a quest.
A brilliant film, on par with any great animation such as ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or ""Spirited Away.""",1070323200,35,1242,4.980676328502415
