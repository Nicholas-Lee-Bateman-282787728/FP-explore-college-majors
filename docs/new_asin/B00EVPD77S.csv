8609894,3,B00EVPD77S,"I would recommend Jon Bon Jovi stick to music - not politics. Had I realized Jon would turn out to be another one of those politically-divisive singers, Bon Jovi music would not be in my collection. Sad, he's chosen to go this route. I'm giving the great sounding music three stars solely because Jon (just like Bruce Springsteen) has traded his good musical talent to become a political ass. Keep creating good music but keep your whiny political viewpoints to yourself, and you'll get the deserved 5 star rating(s).",1493596800,,517,4.820224719101123

8609898,4,B00EVPD77S,"I absolutely love Bon Jovi. They are my favorite band ever. When you see them perform live in concert you have a truly amazing experience - Not only do you have great music but, they all, esp Mr Bon Jovi, a so personable & leave you feeling very positive. Mr Bon Jovi spoke to the audience & told us all that anything we wanted to do was possible. They are amazing & really put on a great show. I could watch them every night. I loved watching this dvd but, was disappointed because I thought that it was a dvd of one of their concerts. but, again, i really enjoyed hearing their story. Rock on Bon Jovi - May you perform for many more years ( until you no longer want to ).",1452038400,3,674,4.075187969924812
8609899,1,B00EVPD77S,"All you Bon Jovi fans out there I suggest you just pass on this one....Biggest piece of ""Home-made"" garbage I have ever seen.... My wife was soooo disappointed and quite frankly so was I..... quality and presence of this VHS quality video made me understand why this IS NOT a licensed video.... Save your money.....

8609900,1,B00EVPD77S,This video was one huge disappointment. It's an unauthorized video of Bon Jovi and is nothing but a bunch of really old interviews by people who worked with them. Picture was fuzzy due to age of interviews.,1451260800,,206,4.594594594594595

8609903,5,B00EVPD77S,"As I said above, I love music, but we all have our favs. The first time I heard our Jersey guys play and sing they became one of my favs and remained one ever sine. Its not becuz I play guitar for 32yrs and write songs as a hobbyor becuz my dad or cuz my dad was in a country band, or becuz they are all are from NJ also. They are extremely talented, they use their fame for important issues that are needed of help. . . . every album they put out I will get and they are all fantastic. Even though Richie is not with the band right they are still going strong! The ppl who stopped listening to Bon Jovi cuz of the Richie situation is upsetting...I keep telling thm he is still part of Bon Jovi, over 30yrs of being in the band they are  all like brothers than friends. Jon even had him come up on stage to play guitar and sing! Its not over folks, they are just wrkin on their own projects, theyve done it before.  Anyway Im rambling on too much, but please get this and listen to it, I know you all will enjoy it and I def recomend it? Have a nice day and God bless you all 0:)",1446768000,6,1079,3.9
