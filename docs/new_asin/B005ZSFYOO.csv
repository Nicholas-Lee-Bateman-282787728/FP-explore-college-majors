4911407,1,B005ZSFYOO,"I am a Christian and was hoping this would be interesting and adventurous, fun for the whole family; instead my family found this very amateurish with a stilted script and frankly it was not worth the time or money.",1350000000,,215,4.538461538461538
4911408,1,B005ZSFYOO,"I got this at redbox because it had a good cover and my 6 year old son wanted to see a film. It is creepy Christian propaganda, absolute garbage storyline and characters, constant wink wink nudge nudge biblical hints, and the special effects were basically monsters made out of trash bags... This movie tries to pose as a Harry potter style film, but don't be fooled-- it's horrific. There's nothing engaging at all about this. All of the positive reviews were made by cast members and their families and their fellow cultists. Avoid this schlock fest at all costs",1347667200,3,564,4.707070707070707
4911409,1,B005ZSFYOO,"The intention for a movie to be based on Pilgrims Progress is commendable but unfortunately this is a poor quality film, poor acting, poor script and poor special effects. I wish I could have a good review as I like the concept, but unfortunately I cannot.",1347580800,3,256,4.586956521739131
4911410,4,B005ZSFYOO,"This movie was rented on a whim and was enjoyed by our whole family (four kids ranging in age from 7 to 13).  Yes the actors are unknown and not ""professional"", Yes the effects are not ""hollywood quality"", but if you've ever read or even heard of John Bunyan's classic Pilgrim's Progress this is a great adaptation. If you can get past all the amateur-ness of the movie and really watch and listen for what it is, you'll see a great movie.",1345766400,6,439,4.353658536585366
4911411,5,B005ZSFYOO,"This is an amazing movie. Finally a high quality, Christian film that doesn't feel low-budget, cheap, or corny. A film truly for all ages. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it. That includes both the laugh-out-loud moments, the thought-provoking moments, and the tear-jerker at the end. I also have friends whose children have ADORED this movie. Children, pre-teens, and adults will all come away challenged and blessed. Highly recommended. I have seen so many Christian movies these days which lack the quality that makes you want to see it even a second time. This one is different. No, it is not on par with Avatar in terms of special effects, but particularly for those of us who have read Pilgrim's Progress, prepare to be touched. I appreciate that the movie stuck to the spirit of Pilgrim's Progress while at the same time updating it for a modern audience. Not an easy task. Well done!",1345248000,3,925,4.7875
4911412,3,B005ZSFYOO,"Yes, it is low budget, with unknown actors, and a Christian moral based movie.  I am watching it now with my two sons as I write this.  They are laughing at the ""special effects"" , making fun of the acting, but still enjoying it.  As significant plot points occur (like when Chris  drops his backpack..aka his burdens..over the cliff and is free to follow God) it becomes a teaching moment on biblical truths and the importance of faith in God.  Really quite a surprisingly enjoyable movie.  I've been far more bored and disappointed by more expensive movies with A-list actors.  Don't listen to Iggy... cough up $1.29 at Redbox for this , you might actually enjoy it!",1345161600,2,668,4.6581196581196584
4911413,1,B005ZSFYOO,"Okay, it is supposed to be a some what post apocalyptic world where they don't even know what books are.  The main character, Chris, ran away from home a long time before, yet he has braces! Need I say more?

The acting was horrible and the special effects looked like they were done by a five year old.  Don't waste your time or money.",1345161600,2,336,4.21875
4911414,3,B005ZSFYOO,"These filmmakers could have benefited from a thorough study of Frank Schaeffer's ""Addicted to Mediocrity.""  From the standpoint of excellence in film-making, the movie was bad.  However, in the scheme of life, there are worse things than being poorly entertained.  And unlike some very well done, richly cast, and riveting movies that encourage revenge, patriotism over virtue, greed, intellectual pride, and other benign looking poisons, I think that despite the puerile acting and lack of sophistry, it was worth watching. My boys, ten and eight, enjoyed it.  And according to them it had a wholesome message.",1344297600,,611,5.333333333333333
4911415,1,B005ZSFYOO,"Don't waste your money. It's like watching an amateur class project made by a sunday school class. Also sold under the name ""The Wylds."" by the way, I love how they ripped off the Harry Potter type font to trick kids (and adults like me) into renting it.

Message = ""There's a war coming! Better read your bible or you'll burn for eternity!!""",1343088000,5,342,4.428571428571429
4911416,3,B005ZSFYOO,"A low budget, very low budget, futuristic quest film with strong moral lessons backed up with lots of electric guitar riffs.

Adventures of Chris Fable, aka The Wylds, tells the tale, or dream, of a boy thief who goes on a journey to Celestial City to find his father.  Along the way, he meets unusual, representative characters, creatures, and thus the ""adventures"".

Pilgrim's Progress, written in the 17th Century, relates similarly the story of Christian in a long two part allegory.  A milestone in Christian literature, it is a story of a man  who carrys a great burden and everything plays out in a symbolic narrative on morals and spiritual life.

This movie is geared, I think towards kids.  It has the Christian theme, and the filmmakers do their best using outdoor shots, camera angles, lively music, and some limited special effects to make a go of it; although, in many places, it's a bit cheesy and corny and comes across like a school production.

I read the reviews from the UK and Canada- they panned it as a waste of time and religious dribble.  The few reviews from the US mostly liked it as clean, family friendly with a good message.

I think it's OK, and I'm a Christian, so I like the message and the effort for the money put into it, but I don't think I'd watch it again.  Perhaps check it out from the library or Redbox and watch a bit and see if it appeals to you.",1333497600,2,1390,4.476190476190476
8489940,1,B005ZSFYOO,Very cheesy knock off of other films including the lettering of the film is stolen from Harry Potter,1524614400,,100,4.611111111111111
8489941,3,B005ZSFYOO,this is an updated version of Pilgram's Promise with cheesy acting and characters.,1484006400,,82,5.384615384615385
8489942,5,B005ZSFYOO,"Terrible acting, terrible adaptations, terrible effects, terrible camera techniques, terrible production- still FIVE STARS HANDS DOWN. From an ironic perspective this will be the most hilarious movie you'll ever watch, so do yourself a favor and buy this movie. The title rip off of Harry Potter is reason enough to give it 5 stars!",1455494400,,332,5.166666666666667
8489943,5,B005ZSFYOO,I love this movie!  Great price!  Thanks so much!,1453680000,,49,4.333333333333333

8489945,5,B005ZSFYOO,"My husband and I purchased this movie under a different title, ""The Wylds.""  We thoroughly enjoyed it and have shared it with our grandsons, ages 7 and 10, and will also be sharing it with our 13 year old grandsons.  It is a timely depiction of the classic story, Pilgrim's Progress, that makes the characters relatable to kids in this generation.  I think kids from 6 to 14 would benefit from watching this movie, and also from any age-appropriate discussions in relation to the Christian theme.",1393632000,,496,4.744186046511628
8489946,2,B005ZSFYOO,"I read the reviews before I bought this movie and based on them bought the movie. The movie was a huge disappointment and even more so because the reviews were misleading. I am a Christian and I must say that this movie is not worth your time nor is it worth your money. The cinematography was poor at best and the acting was more appropriate for a high school play. I watched this with my sons and their cousins whose ages ran from 10 to 16. Not one of us liked the movie although we did get in a few laughs - simply because many of the scenes were so bad that they were laughable. I wish I had a more positive review to give, but I really would hate to see anyone duped by the reviews that tell you this is a fair or good movie. Sadly, reviews that say so, in my opinion, are not accurate.",1380067200,2,791,4.012658227848101
8489947,1,B005ZSFYOO,"This movie was poorly edited, and overall really terrible and boring. The message maybe good, but it isn't worth watching... read the bible instead, that is more fun.",1361577600,,166,4.964285714285714
8489948,1,B005ZSFYOO,I rented this movie from red box and its so corny very low budget film I was actually bored while watching this the whole movie looked like the creators were drunk making this I would not buy this movie do don't waste any time on this terrible movie.,1357430400,,250,4.229166666666667
8489949,4,B005ZSFYOO,"Wow this was really good. I enjoyed it and while low budget there was something mysterious about it. Something amazing. Curious, very well done. Excellent acting I think, unique characters, very different and uniquely portrayed. Liked it a lot. Might be worth buying for my library.
