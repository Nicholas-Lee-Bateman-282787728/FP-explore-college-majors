2119683,5,B0002TT0MS,"Ostensibly 'Maria Full of Grace' is the story of a young Columbian woman who becomes a mule. But to say this is a story about mules or the drug trade is like saying 'Saturday Night Fever' is about disco dancing. It is part of the plot but the movie's message is about hope, survival and the quest for a more promising future. Maria is a poor Columbian girl who sees the limits of her existence. She's working in a dead-end job. She just got pregnant by an unambitious local boy who doesn't love her. She rebels against this environment, a common adolescent reaction. But Maria is willing to take risks. Her first big risk is becoming a mule. Much of the movie revolves around the perilous journey on board the airplane. But Maria's greatest risk is to give up everything she knows and stays in America to give herself and her child the promise of a brighter future. I think any American should see this movie because we are all (except for Indians) a nation of immigrants. We all had to leave our former homeland to come here. Also as individuals we must separate from our parents and take chances to start our own lives. So this movie has universal appeal. I highly recommend it.",1091750400,2,1180,4.493023255813953
2119684,5,B0002TT0MS,"Most movies about the drug trade tend to either focus on the drug dealers or the users; little cinematic attention has been focused on role of the mule. For this very reason MARY FULL OF GRACE is an insightful and provocative look into how cocaine is smuggled into the United States. In a small town outside Bogota, Colombia young Maria Alvarez quits from her assembly line job and dumps her loser boyfriend she contemplates options available to her. At a dance she meets Franklin who befriends her and offers her a job including ""travel"" and good money. While the risks and harm are significant Maria decides to take Franklin up on his offer. After swallowing 62 cocaine pellets she flies to New York City in return for a handsome sum of money.

 MARIA FULL OF GRACE is a superb film filled with drama and emotional depth. One can't help but emphasize with Maria's dire situation and hope that she doesn't get caught by the U.S. Customs, or even worse, die after a cocaine pellet explodes in her stomach while in transition. This film succeeds in putting a human face to the mule and succeeds in adding clarity to their desperate situations. It is a film about real life.

 MARIA FULL OF GRACE is undoubtedly one of my favorite foreign films of 2004.",1091145600,10,1251,4.621621621621622
2119685,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a small town Colombiana with a major league 'tude: she knows what she was born into but also knows she doesn't like it and strives, and more to the point, craves for more. One day she is approached by someone who can set her up as a Mula: a courier who swallows rubber capsules of drugs and smuggles them into the USA and hopefully earn some big bucks in the process. But what Maria doesn't bargain for is that she will find more than a bucket of money at the end of the rainbow in the borough of Queens in NYC, USA.
MARIA FULL OF GRACE is a subtle, audaciously well directed (by Joshua Marston) film about what happens when you get what you wish for and ultimately regret having wished for it in the first place. This is Moreno's first film and she is heartbreakingly beautiful and touching as Maria. She is dark, sexy and quietly sensual: the kind of woman who is not aware of her powers, yet wields them nonetheless.
Director Marston has made a film of uncommon grace and intelligence. Don't come to this film looking for a glossed over, sugar coated story, you will not find it. What you will find is the ugly and the real told in a manner that can only be described as beautiful yet painstakingly blunt.",1090627200,,1251,4.396551724137931

The thing that really caught my attention was a statement in commentary that said the people in this country that USE these drugs should see how it hurts the people who put their lives on the line (in numerous ways) to smuggle these drugs into this country.

2119769,4,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace focuses on the life of a fairly common girl growing up in Columbia 17-year-old Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno).  Her work dethorning roses pays meagerly, and her boss won't even let her take a quick break.  She asks to urinate, he replies, ""If you do, urine trouble,"" and she says ""Urine ojete; I quit.""  Although, I must admit that my Spanish is rusty, I ignored the captions a few times, and the Spanish in this film is on Columbian hyperdrive like they're purposely trying to insert slang and confusion.  The lack of job puts a particular cramp on her family because she's the family pack mule; she carries/supports her mother, her sister, and her sister's bastard.  The latter is supported unwillingly.  There goes that iPhone data plan!  Unfortunately, this dire financial situation also left Maria without enough dinero to buy condoms.  Better make that crib a double!  At this point, Maria has few choices.  Make no mistake, we always have choices, but Maria's are almost all bad.  But since she's in Columbia and she's used to being a mule...why not make some big bucks doing what she knows?  Who else is going to facilitate New York's llello delivery to privileged, trust-funds named Trent and Cole, or the Ivory Tower of Wall Streeters who need a pick-me-up to screw over the rest of America for longer than an 8-hour work day?  The stage is set; let the drug smuggling commence.

Devoid of massive cocaine factory explosions which rain Columbian sugar down on an entire village, it is apparent director/screenwriter Joshua Marston took no pointers from Michael Bay.  Instead, a realistic approach is delivered without condescension or preaching.  Much appreciated.  Nearly all focus is on the protagonist; her jealous, gordita girlfriend, and the third most dangerous activity involving a mule I can think of.  By all appearances it's the second most authentic film about drug trafficking which has probably ever been made.  First is clearly Aces: Iron Eagle III.  Classic.

I enjoyed this tense, character-driven look into the world of poverty, drugs, the lubricating properties of tooth paste, and a recycling scene that toes the line of Human Centipede material.  At no time during the movie are decisions or scenarios unfathomable, which, in and of itself, makes the message powerful, enthralling, and interesting.  Moreno's performance cements this movie's profound significance and impact.

Note: I realize crank is a slang term for meth, and not cocaine.",1307923200,3,2492,5.08128078817734

It's about dirt poor young Columbian girls smuggling drugs into the United States.  I thought all the actors did an excellent job. The directing and photography was also great.  The young girl who plays Maria was totally believable - she is a fine actress. The movie is in Spanish, but I found the English sub-titles very easy to read.",1299715200,2,630,4.548672566371682

It's remains a favorite ""international"" film of mine since its release.",1298592000,,386,4.6911764705882355
2119773,3,B0002TT0MS,"Director Joshua Marston in his first feature film brings us a story rich with interesting characters, fantastic acting and a fairly good script. Unfortunately, the turning point in the story seemed unrealistic and made the movie drop some points in my book. ""Maria Full of Grace"" is a very well made film and if the middle point transition was done differently it would have been a 4/5 easily.

""Maria"", a pregnant Colombian teenager played by Catalina Sandino Moreno decides to become a drug ""mule"" to make money for her family. She lives a difficult life in Columbia working in a flower cutting plantation making little money and generally unhappy. Her income pays for her family, including a single mother sister who refuses to work. One fateful day she's had enough of her boss's unwarranted accusations and quits. On her way to find more work she is offered a job as a mule for the local drug cartel. She eventually accepts and so there we are, witnessing how a seemingly normal and law abiding girl gets pulled into the seedy world of Colombian Drug Cartels. The story goes on to show how she prepares for the task of transporting drug pellets in her stomach to America. We eventually come to realize there are more mules going along with her on the journey, though not all of them make it. Once in America the mules are corralled by the local dealers and made to ""release"" the drugs so to speak. From there Maria and Blanca's journey takes a turn for the worse.

I admire actress Catalina Sandino Moreno greatly as she and the director decided to not prepare for the swallowing of the large ""pellets"" that contained the drugs. Marston and Moreno agreed that this would make the scenes more realistic and boy were they right. I felt like I was watching the real thing. Moreno did a phenomenal job. She also did not meet with any real or former drug mules in order to be as ""new"" to the experience as possible while filming. Moreno was not the only one with solid acting. A friend of Maria's also decides to become a mule. Blanca accurately played by Yenny Paola Vega, is an immature, ""do as I wish"" kind of girl. A sharp contrast to Maria's cautiousness. The two were a great dynamic and they both acted brilliantly.

Aesthetically, the film was well done. There were no extravagant vistas or bright colors to speak of. The concentration of Cinematographer Jim Denault was to portray the grimy real setting of Columbia and New York. He succeeded and managed to keep the attention on the characters instead of the sets. It was filmed in such a ""no frills"" kind of way, I really appreciated the direction they took. It fit well with the subject matter.

Now, in regards to the story, it was original and interesting. The writers made you sympathize with Maria and her plight. Unfortunately, the plot shift, just didn't work for me. It was disappointing, but still well acted and directed.

***BEGIN SPOILERS***
After Maria and Blanca are ordered to relieve themselves of the pellets, a third mule is viciously murdered (off screen) in order to extract the pellets she had inside of her. The dealers decide to get rid of the body immediately leaving a bathtub full of blood while Maria and Blanca sleep. Of coarse, Maria wakes up to find them taking the body and she sees the blood all over the tub. Maria convinces Blanca to leave with the drugs and so begins the second act. Them hiding from the dealers until they are able figure out what to do and how to get their payments. Luckily, the dealers don't want the boss to know they let the drugs get away so they don't do anything about it. Finally, Maria and Blanca call the dealers and make the exchange. There is another underlying story going on once Maria and Blanca leave the hotel, which was very dramatic, but I just couldn't get past the incompetence of the dealers. I suppose the point of the writing was to show that the dealers were just young and dumb, but it seemed highly unrealistic.
***END SPOILERS***

I enjoyed most of this movie. The script, acting and direction were all superb. Moreno did such a great job that she was the first Colombian to be nominated for an Academy Award. Further, she was the first actress ever to be nominated for an Oscar for a role spoken entirely in Spanish. For her debut role, this is quite the accomplishment. Viewers will be divided about the plot change but the first half of the movie was so well done it makes for a good experience regardless.

Maria Full of Grace--one would think a movie with this title would involve a religious subject matter. On the contrary, this eye-opening film depicts a very disturbing situation that involves a seventeen-year-old girl and her involvement in the drug trade. Meet Maria, a poor, Colombian teenager who works in a rose factory to bring in a much needed income to help support her family. In order to escape the harsh reality in which she lives, Maria spends a great deal of time with her irresponsible boyfriend, which leads to her premarital pregnancy. However, contrary to what her family would want, Maria refuses to marry the father of her child and decides to raise the baby herself. Fed up with the life that she is living, she decides to quit her grueling factory job and is persuaded by a friend to work as a drug mule, a job that promises a great deal of money. It requires Maria's swallowing 60 pellets of heroin and traveling to New York where she must deliver the drugs. Her boss convinces her that the job will be relatively simple, but Maria quickly learns that the life of a drug mule is no easy one. Blanca, Maria's stubborn, nave young friend, decides to join Maria in the trade and travels with her to New York. On the way, another woman, Lucy, who also works as a drug mule becomes ill and dies due to a ruptured heroin pellet in her stomach. Maria and Blanca, shocked with the realization of what their fate might also be, refuse to transport the drugs. They are on their own, completely alone in a strange, new country. They end up finding a place to stay with an immigrant named Patricia Rae who eventually turns them out. In the end, Blanca has the opportunity to go back to Colombia, but Maria must remain in the United States and try to make a way for herself. The film ends on an ambiguous note.

I found that quality of acting in this movie was quite good.  All the actors seemed to put sincerity into their roles. The main character of Maria, played by Catalina Sandino Moreno, conveys the honesty and spunk which shape the personality of her character. Although Maria Full of Grace tells a fictional story, the movie was intended to portray a very realistic story, something that could easily happen in real life. And since this film deals with a very true to life subject matter, I think the filmmakers wanted the audience to really get a glimpse of a world like Maria's. The use of hand-held cameras contributed to the film's feeling of realism. It was filmed entirely in Spanish. In the end of the movie, Maria is walking out of the airport. Viewers anxiously want to know what she will do next. The movie seems to lack completeness due to its leaving the audience a bit unsatisfied. Some may consider this a downer on the movie's part. One the contrary, the main point of this film is to capture only part of an ordinary person's life. The ambiguity was the filmmakers' intention.

Maria Full of Grace sends a certain messages to its viewers. One point that the film tries to get across is that some people who get involved with crime are not necessarily doing so to hurt other people. Sometimes, people see no other option but through illegal means to make it through life. The movie also ties in the immigration issue. Instead of viewing immigrants as a burden on society, it sympathizes with them. It is saying that people need to help those who are less fortunate, like Maria. Maria however is not necessarily viewed entirely as a victim. She takes the job as a drug mule willingly. But the film does inform the viewer of the reason why Maria took the job--so she could make a living to support her daughter. Exploration of motives seems to be a key theme in this movie.  Maria wants to do the right thing for her child, but takes the wrong road in doing this. She endangers her unborn baby by swallowing dangerous drugs and gullibly believes that a job as a drug mule will be a good, well-paying one. What she does not know at the time is that although her illegal job might pay well, the price that must be paid for her actions is far greater than the reward is. It is not until later in the film that Maria realizes that crime is never the right road to take.

On that note, I think that the general strength of Maria Full of Grace is in its excellent character development. Each person changes throughout the course of the story. The movie shows a picture of life, and in life, people change. They learn lessons that shape the way they become. And in this movie, Maria learns valuable lessons. At the beginning, Maria is a free-spirited, strong-willed girl who thinks that running away from her life is the only way to really live. But the burdens of decision-making and being on her own are challenges that she must learn to face. Maria is a normal human being, with no particular amazing skills and abilities, someone we all can relate to. This makes the audience feel drawn to her character and want to help those who are like her. The movie makes you think, ""This could really happen in real life. There are people out there who are going through the same things.""

I think that Maria Full of Grace would specifically appeal to those who enjoy more serious dramas. I recommend this film particularly to adults, since much of the featured content can be quite disturbing for younger viewers (rated R for drug content and language). Though the movie in itself is very good, it also contains mature themes. Maria Full of Grace shows viewers an aspect of the world that many do not know about and is definitely a beneficial viewing experience.",1291593600,3,5607,4.56206554121152

2119778,3,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace (Joshua Marston, 2004)

I find it odd that this is the third ""foreign"" film I've reviewed in the past month with an American director, but encouraging as well; Americans are often disparaged for having, shall we say, our own unique take on world events (that usually boils down to ""America, [censored for Amazon consumption] yeah!""). And none of the three (Chris Smith's The Pool, Cary Fukunaga's Sin Nombre, and Joshua Marston's Maria Full of Grace) seem to take that provincial ""oh, my, look at the interesting natives"" approach that's been endemic in American film since Nanook of the North. Obviously, being American myself, and not well-traveled, my main experience of Goa, Mexico, and Colombia, respectively, comes from the media put out by those countries (the novels, the movies, etc.), but going on those, it does seem to me that these filmmakers are trying to look at their subjects from as much a native perspective as they can. That said, it seems that Maria Full of Grace is the least successful of these, in that regard; it focuses on one narrow piece of Colombian life before transferring its action to New York City. On the other hand, looked at just as a film, it is the most successful of the three for precisely that reason; Marston has a story and he's interested in telling it without the details getting in the way.

Maria (Che's Catalina Sandino Moreno in her screen debut) is a Colombian teenager whose meager pay stripping the thorns from roses goes towards keeping her entire family fed and clothed. After an altercation with her boss, she quits the job in a fit of pique (and rightfully so), but that leaves her family with no income. Given the choice, she opts for making a lot of money very easily: she becomes a drug mule, as does her best friend Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega in her only screen appearance to date). The first half of the film covers this, along with the two of them befriending another mule, Lucy (Guilied Lopez, another with no other credits), getting loaded up with the drugs, and then heading to New York. The second half of the film is Maria in New York, where things go wrong, as things like this are won't to do, and she finds herself adrift, with her only contacts in the city Lucy's sister, whom she's never met, and the inconstant Blanca.

The movie has been hailed many times over for its gritty realism, but no one focuses on the more intriguing idea that this is actually noir. Think about it. There are no good guys in this film (with the possible exception of Don Fernando, a helpful New Yorker, but he is more reporter than participant in the film's events), only bad guys and badder guys. The protagonist is somewhat hapless, has a more hapless sidekick, and finds herself in way over her head from the get-go. Every time Maria attempts to do what she thinks is the right thing, it goes horribly wrong, sometimes more horribly than others. Is that not the essence of noir? Even the ending, which is far more ambivalent than one would expect (noir rarely, if ever, leaves room for hope), is not the kind that normally caps off a straight drama.

On the downside, however, is my wife's first comment after she'd thought it over for a while. ""Have we seen that before? I don't remember seeing it, but I knew certain scenes before I actually saw them."" No, we hadn't seen it before, but it's an understandable reaction; there is very little new here. There is artistry in the production (I originally wrote ""production in the artistry"" and it seemed right until I reread it, which should tell you something), and a lot of very good acting from people who are not (or were not at the time) actors. But if you experience deja vu while viewing, don't be surprised. ***",1264550400,,3740,4.628012048192771

2119782,4,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace"" is an absorbing drama that telescopes a singular component of the supply-side of immigrant drug-running.  It shows how destitute young women from poor countries like Columbia are lured into becoming ""mules""--illegal importers of high-value drugs like cocaine and heroin into the United States--with (often false) promises of instant wealth and relative safety.  As such, the 17-year-old Maria (played by Catalino Moreno) is the flawless prototype.  She's a poor, ill-educated assembly-line worker who is also her family's main breadwinner.  Maria is clearly smart and intuitive but, saddled with an unplanned pregnancy, she's also a bit feisty and somewhat sullen, longing to escape the dullness and drudgery of her Colombian village.  ""Grace"" revolves around Maria's decision to join the drug-running trade--for the lack of other viable options--and her efforts to avoid detection (after having ingested 30 or more pellets of drugs) by US Customs, outlast the middlemen, and find a way to survive the strange urban jungle that is New York.  The film effectively communicates the social and economic desperation that often drives such women to risk life and liberty for a relatively small return.  It also depicts the callousness and the (sometimes deadly) indifference of the middle-men who chaperone the girls and ensure--by whatever means necessary-- that they deliver the goods. What holds this truncated film together is Moreno's fragile yet hard-edged affect.  Director Joshua Marston's economy of style is well-matched by Moreno's performance.  She's a stunning, dark-eyed beauty, whose young-old face alone tells Maria's story. Her Maria is defiant yet quietly desperate, bold yet cautious, nave but distrustful--she immediately pulls us in and makes us care about this girl-woman's fate.

2119785,5,B0002TT0MS,"I got into a heated debate with a friend the other day about the difference between subtlety and lifelessness.  He got all up in arms when I labeled Ed Harris's nomination for `The Truman Show' a joke.  Now as many of you know, I love the movie, but I felt that Harris really added nothing to the film.  He was less subtle and more hollow.  So, when he said that I wouldn't appreciate subtleness if it hit me in the face I rattled off this little film and told him to bask in the glory that is Catalina Sandino Moreno and her brilliant use of subtle forcefulness.  So, we watched the film together, and my adoration of her performance was deepened and I think I made my point.

This performance may be quiet, but it is in no way shape or form `hollow'.

`Maria, Llena Eres de Gracia' is a brilliant film, truly, from start to finish one of the most honest and raw films I have seen in recent years.  The film feels so natural, which only adds to the emotional destruction the audience goes through while watching it.  There is nothing that feels Hollywoodized or embellished in that overly dramatic heavy handed way that most films are done today.  It is simply raw and gritty and truth; pure truth.

Here we are told the story of young Maria, a seventeen-year-old Columbian who lives with her mother and grandmother, her sister and her young nephew.  She works hard every day dethroning flowers only to pay more than her share at home.  When Maria winds up pregnant she is faced with a decision.  Her boyfriend isn't the marrying type, and her job is less that satisfactory so she decides to leave town and try to find work elsewhere.  That is when she is given the opportunity to make some quick and `easy' money.  She is asked to become a mule, swallowing pellets of heroine and smuggling them into the states.  She accepts, and her harrowing journey is one of danger, fear and ultimately self awakening.

The film, much like Moreno, is very subtle.  There is nothing here that is over-the-top or any mere scene that begs for your attention the way that most films produced today do.  The story is told in a very focused yet very earnest way.  We see everything (almost everything) in a very point-blank manor.  Nothing is glamorized, nothing is sugar-coated; nothing is depicted as anything other than reality.  I think I first realized this when Maria has to wash off pellets after she went to the bathroom and then re-swallow them in the airplane bathroom.

Fearless.

I want to take a minute to applaud the Academy for nominating Moreno back in 2004 for Best Lead Actress.  I often give the Academy a hard time for nominating gimmicky and obvious performances that take no imagination and really require no stretch of talent, but in 2004 they nominated five VERY worthy performances (albeit handing possibly the least worthy the award).  Catalina Sandino Moreno delivers such a spellbindingly pure performance, never reaching too far and coming off as forced but always keeping her characters innocence and naivety a central part of her performance.  Maria is sincere and genuine, yet confused and determined.  This reads beautifully on the screen.  She is gives such a radiant performance, one that is nuanced to perfection and such a dynamic force without being abrupt and outlandish.

First time actress Moreno (yes, this is her DEBUT performance) and newcomer writer/director Joshua Marston (he had one credit under his belt before this) are a brilliant team who mesh so well with one another to create a film that reaches the heart and stirs the emotions and will remain utterly unforgettable.  Watching Maria grow as a person throughout this treacherous journey may be hard to take, but in the end the reward is beautiful beyond words.",1222905600,,3748,4.718461538461538
2119786,5,B0002TT0MS,"A drug mule is a human being who agrees to, or is coerced into swallowing a large number of latex drug pellets filled with cocaine in order to smuggle the illicit narcotics into the United States. The movie tells how a group of women out of desperation become mules. It is a degrading, deeply dehumanizing, dangerous thing to do. If a pellet ruptures and the drugs get loose in the body, they can easily cause death. This small indie movie makes this experience human, tragic, and intimate to moviegoers. It carefully details the technique as the women practice swallowing whole grapes.
 Maria, a beautiful, strong-willed woman chooses to be part of this very dangerous drug trafficking scheme. She is pregnant, terrified of being discovered, and feels trapped. She has lost her job in a fresh flower factory stripping the thorns and leaves off stems. The irony is that Colombia exports both flowers and cocaine. At one point Maria in New York passes a flower stand selling imported flowers.
 The focus in this film is on women. It has good direction and fine acting. The ordinary scenes in Colombia and in New York City seem very authentic, realistic. The plight of these women is made very urgent and tragedy strikes in one case. It's a very affecting movie that documents the seriousness of this kind of crime that turns human beings into mules.

2119788,5,B0002TT0MS,"Painful and ugly, Maria Llena de Gracia is also a powerful experience of vicarious desperation and deprivation. The story of a village girl in Colombia whose family, novio, and job all fail her at the same moment. She rushes heedlessly into big trouble, which in Colombia can only mean the cocaine trade. Coke merchants and smugglers are not nice people; we know that, and to see this film as an indictment of their viciousness is only a fraction of the movie's content. It's also, and more importantly an indictment of the global economy, the Octopus of our era with far stronger tentacles than the railroad of the early 20th Century. The indictment is clear from the first scene of the movie, when ALL the young women of the community report for work through a high wire fence to the warehouse where roses are trimmed and wrapped for export to North America. There is no other work in the village, no subsistence, no options, no future. If it were in Mexico - and there are exactly the same horrible sweat-shops in NAFTAfied Mexico - one would have at least the option of illegal emigration to El Norte, but in Colombia, it's 'muling' drugs or maid service. Frankly, I doubt that many American viewers of this film really saw what it was about from the Colombian perspective. Stopping the drug traffic isn't just a matter of spraying lethal chemicals over the countryside or supplying arms and helicopters to the latifundistas who own the government, and it isn't just a matter of reducing demand from the two poles of American society - the marginalized Black and the overprivileged White - either. It's a matter of facilitating the recovery of a diverse local economy, in which most people can make a living and a few can even find opportunity without crime and violence.

The Spanish spoken in this film, by the way, is extremely hard to catch unless you've heard the rural dialects before. The ""vos"" forms are used throughout (vosotros in Spain, the second person plural) and slang is pervasive.

She meets Franklin who sets her up as a ""mule"", a stubborn woman who has the courage and composure to swallow over sixty balloons of heroin and deliver them in her belly to New York City. The narrative never allows you to agree or quite disagree with her decision. She is young,she is desperate, and she honestly does not fully understand the immense risk she is taking. That is what makes this film so compelling and the character of Maria so rich;we simply cannot judge her.

2119807,3,B0002TT0MS,"""Maria Full of Grace"" by Joshua Marston certainly has a story to tell.  The fault with the movie is that the powerful tale could be told better and more powerfully.  The characters could have been brought to life more aptly by more apt actors.  The lead actress Catalin Sandino Moreno is no doubt a beautiful young woman who portrays subtle emotions and feelings in her angelic face but her supporting cast doesn't really show up to the dance and the script writing is lacking.

What I believe the film to be about is bringing to light a certain level of social awareness of the immigrant story.  Even if the immigrant story is born out of desperation, a desperation so powerful as to cause young sub-20 year old people to swallow enough drugs to feed a habit the size of Utah.  This film brings to light the story of mules--humans trafficking drugs within their bodies awaiting to poop them out on American soil so the drug cartels can continue to thrive.  It is no doubt a story that needs to be told and an awareness that needs to come to the good common folk of the US of A.  We are supposed to be the melting pot are we not?  We were all traced back to immigrants, yes?

The actress that plays Maria's friend, Blanca turns in one of the more 1-dimensional stone-faced performances seen in quite a while.  Of the other mules that accompany Maria and Blanca to New York...well the story writing really doesn't support getting to know them.  We know little to nothing about any of the characters outside of Maria and it is a flaw.  A flaw leaving you thinking this movie and this story could have really been something.

If you are interested in the dynamics of the drug trade, Colombia's civil war plight, policies behind the war on drugs, or humanistic tales of immigrants, I'd say go ahead and watch this flick.  If you are looking to view some of the greatest movies around year by year and are peeking at those that came out in 2003, I'd say go elsewhere.  The reviews and recommendations suffer from critics automatically giving higher ratings to foreign films.

2119811,5,B0002TT0MS,"""Maria llenas eres de gracia,"" is one of the outstanding films of the new century, and one of the best I've seen in months.  Joshua Marston, who wrote the script and directed, took a commercial idea--that of telling a story about the ""mulas"" who smuggle drugs into the US by swallowing pellets of cocaine or (in this case) heroin wrapped in latex which they later excrete.  Should one of them burst before it is passed out of the body, it is likely the mule will die.  It's a risky business in more ways than one, and only somebody desperate or foolish would do it.

So the first thing that Marston must do is establish Maria's character in such a way that we can believe she would do something like this.  She is, on the one hand, an ordinary 17-year-old Columbian girl who works stripping the thorns from the stems of roses in a factory.  She lives at home with her mother, sister and her sister's baby.  She has a boyfriend.  She has to work to help support the family.  On the other hand she is a headstrong person, a pretty girl with a head on her shoulders.

But Maria is not exactly desperate.  She is a bit of a gambler, somewhat foolish, no doubt, but she is also a strong person with great personal integrity.  Marston allows us to see in the beginning of the film that she will take chances that others won't.  She climbs up onto the roof of a building, a climb her boyfriend is afraid to make.  We see her tell her boss (more or less) to take this job and shove it when he won't let her go to the bathroom.  And we realize shortly thereafter why she needs to go to the bathroom more often than usual.  We watch her tell her boyfriend about her predicament, and she does it in such a way that we can tell that she is searching for how he really feels.  And when she finds out he doesn't really love her, at least doesn't love her the way she wants to be loved, she leaves him.

But now she is in a fix.  Her job helped pay for the family's bills.  Now the situation is set.  Her character is set.  The premise of the film can unwind: and so she meets a young man on a motorcycle who tells her how she can make some serious money smuggling drugs into the US.

Imagine how the average Hollywood director would fashion a movie from such a premise.  There would be brutality, gun fights, car chases.  Cardboard villains would exploit Maria and others like her.  There would be some heroics and perhaps a knight in shining armor would save Maria.

But that is not how Marston plays it.  He opts for realism and he doesn't wallow in the violence or the exploitation.  He keeps the focus on Maria and her personal struggle to find herself and to deal with the circumstances she has gotten into.  The characters are real, the situations are authentic, and the details are closely observed and realistic.  We see Maria practice swallowing large globe grapes.  We see the people in the drug-smuggling business and some of the other mules.  We see the security people at the airport and the young men who watch the girls until the pellets are passed.  There is no glamor among these characters.  It is clear they are patterned after real people who could actually be in this ugly business.  And in the end we see the triumph of Maria's character.

What makes this such an outstanding movie is not only the careful, clear and veracious way that Marston tells the story, but the compelling performance by Catalina Sandino Moreno who plays Maria.  She is a very talented young actress who has the kind of beauty that suggests something close to nobility of character, if I may use such an old-fashioned phrase.  It is this quality of hers that Marston captures and emphasizes.  The result is one of the most arresting performances I've seen in quite a while.  Moreno appears entirely real, completely divorced from any phony celluloid heroine.  She became to me--and this is what all great actors can do--someone I know, someone I care about, and I was filled with emotion as the movie ended.

""This is a movie about a girl becoming a woman,"" is the way Moreno expressed it.  Marston puts it this way, ""I realized...I was making a film about a girl who was doing something universal in trying to figure out the meaning of her life.""  This is really what the story is about: becoming a woman in this world of risks and trade-offs, of dangers and obligations.

A movie that is a work of art and worthy of something more than the diversion of an evening should affect the viewer emotionally, intellectually and artistically.  Maria Full of Grace is such a movie, a movie that comes along perhaps once a year, or perhaps only once in several years.  It's that good.

By all means see this for Catalina Sandino Moreno who was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy in 2005 but lost out to Hilary Swank for her performance in Million Dollar Baby (2004).  And see it for Joshua Marston who made it real.",1168041600,14,4896,4.4460674157303375

2119814,4,B0002TT0MS,"Maria is a young dissatisfied Columbian woman (actually 17) who works at a rose plantation to help support her family, including her unwed-mother sister. Life, including work, boyfriend and family, continue to grate on her and she gravitates to a recruiter of ""mules""--young women who swallow latex-covered ""pellets"" of heroin to transport by commercial airline to New York City. Her veteran trainer describes the work as ""not difficult, but not easy, either"". I couldn't find the easy part. Swallowing in excess of 50 pellets didn't look too easy; nor did facing the suspicious US Customs agents; nor did risking the overdose that loomed if any the pellets broke.

The result is a heartbreaking tale of longing for a better life and how criminal elements can exploit that longing. The ""grace"" of the title presages Maria's outcome, but much pain and sadness populates this movie as well. Catalina Sandino Moreno is riveting as the determined Maria and all the other cast members do a fine job well. The production and directorial-style and very straightforward so as to not distract from the compelling story.

This movie is in Spanish with English subtitles. With the drug-related story and one violent scene, it is not really suitable for sub-teenage children, though it would help teenagers understand better the costs of the drug culture.",1162252800,,1343,5.127853881278539

Her life begins to spin out of control when the boy childish she has been dating begins to drift from her, she quits her job de-thorning roses (a beautiful and subtle image for the woman she allegorically portrays) and realizes she is pregnant.

Hope arrives in the opportunity to smuggle drugs to America swallowing condoms containing cocaine. She accepts and we are drawn into the tale wondering what will happen to her and the three other young women working as ""mules"" for the drug runners.

You can tell by the title that Maria symbolically portrays Mary, the mother of Jesus: a beautiful young woman arrives pregnant and unmarried in the big city (in this case, New York) where she has no place to stay and no one to trust. Her innocent child brings her hope and in the end, frees her from her past.

By contrasting the difficult choices of a real-world teen with the overarching biblical narrative always faintly in the background, the filmmakers have created an exquisite and, in the end, redemptive tale of life on this broken planet. Highly recommended.",1156464000,2,1215,4.859903381642512

2119821,4,B0002TT0MS,"This first-time work by director/writer Joshua Marston is impressively unadorned in a way that surprised me because of what I perceived to be the predictable elements involved. For a low-budget indie, the 2004 film also has surprisingly first-class production values, most specifically the very crisp camerawork by Jim Denault, who captures the realism of the various locales - Bogota, New York City, Jersey City - without jittery stylization. The straight-ahead story focuses on seventeen-year old Maria, pregnant and in a dead-end job picking thorns off roses on a Columbian plantation. Tired of her presumed lot in life, she breaks up with her thoughtless boyfriend and connects with a friend who leads her to a drug lord. He offers her a job as a ""mule"", which means ingesting 62 pellets of heroin and traveling to New York to make the delivery.

The stacked-deck set-up sounds like the plot would spiral into issue-oriented melodrama and ""Scarface""-like bloody confrontations. Instead, Marston uses an almost matter-of-fact approach to the escalating complications that Maria faces in taking the job and her ensuing experiences in the U.S. There is a naturally spontaneous quality to the unexpected storyline that propels it with candor and emotional resonance. It helps that the filmmaker found the ideal Maria in big-screen rookie Catalina Sandino Moreno, whose plaintive presence and realistic acting provide the film a genuine soul at its core. The rest of the unknown cast seems incidental by comparison, though there is solid work by Moreno look-alike Guilied Lopez as Lucy, the more experienced mule facing inner turmoil about her decision; Patricia Rae especially powerful in her few scenes as Carla, Lucy's estranged sister living in New York (her no-nonsense but sympathetic character reminds me a bit of the roles Frances McDormand usually takes); and Yenny Paola Vega as Maria's clingy, foolhardy friend Blanca.

As expected, the pellet ingestion scene is painful to watch, and there is some overly convenient wrap-up toward the end that seems to oversimplify the problems Marston painstakingly presents. In fact, at certain points late in the film, I did start to get concerned that he was going to turn the movie into a don't-let-this-happen-to-you parable, but luckily my worries were not realized. Regardless, it's a wondrous debut for both Marston and Moreno, and clearly both are well poised to do great work in the future.

2119825,5,B0002TT0MS,"""Maria Full of Grace,"" a debut film for both its director and lead actress is a phenomenal movie, and the religious nuance of the title is totally apt.  The poster art is not.

Set in Columbia, and Queens, NY,  it's the story of a young woman who knows there must be a better life, but whose options are limited.  She becomes a drug mule, ingests half a kilo of heroin in thumb-sized latex wrapped pellets , and flies to NY to make the delivery.  To tell more would be to spoil the story; suffice to say the movie does not flinch in presenting Maria's life, choices, training, or the aftermath of her adventure.

Catalina Sandrino Moreno may be the most transparent and natural actress I've ever seen.  Her eyes, body, and vocal inflections reveal all, but telegraph nothing, and her presence held my eye over anything else on the screen. I think she's in every scene, and I couldn't spot a false note in anything she did.  Her character, Maria, never seems to be in over her head, but certainly up to her eyeballs, and you can see the wheels turn as she makes decisions.  I never lost hope for her.

Director Joshua Marston keeps the story tightly focused, and makes all the right choices.

I hope ""Maria Full of Grace,"" stays on the radar for a long time.  It deserves to become a classic.",1136851200,4,1291,4.446808510638298
2119826,5,B0002TT0MS,"Wow. While a bit of a downer at times, I found Maria Full of Grace fascinating and, ultimately, hopeful. Maria lives in Columbia, and she works long, humiliating hours at a flower plantation. She chafes under the supervision of her pompous supervisor, but her family needs her checks to pay for necessities such as medicine. After a particularly difficult day, Maria finally quits her job. Her sister (who, incidentally, doesn't even have a job) is thrown into an uproar. Shortly thereafter, Maria meets Franklin, a silver-tongued young man who is involved in the country's illicit drug trade, at a party. Franklin promises Maria big bucks and the chance to travel if she will serve as a drug mule, smuggling cocaine into America. (He doesn't mention up front that Maria will have to swallow approximately 60 laytex-wrapped pellets of the drug to make the transfer.) Maria, who has recently discovered that she is pregnant, makes a desperate grab at the opportunity.

This was a very powerful film. Catalina Sandino Moreno, who plays Maria, turns in a truly star performance. Although the situations Maria is faced with are definitely high-stakes, Moreno never overacts or emotes. Maria is a thinker. She considers her decisions; even though most of her options are unpleasant, she weighs them carefully. Moreno portrays this measured quality wonderfully. I highly recommend this film. It's filmed in Spanish, with subtitles, but the performances are so good that you'll hardly notice. No nudity, some language, and very gritty material in some scenes.",1135728000,3,1552,5.183266932270916
2119827,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace is what makes films great.  You read about Maria's story in the papers and you'll shrug your shoulders and say, ""she got what was coming to her, a person with no moral values"".  You see her story on the big screen and you understand her...and more importantly, you become involved in her life.

First time film director, Joshua Marston shows what it means to be a mule with such step-by-step completeness that it's difficult to imagine that a documentary could be more detailed. It is a measure of Maria's desperation, her total lack of viable alternatives, that she should risk her life - all it takes to cause death is one leaky capsule - and at the same time place herself in the hands of murderously ruthless individuals.

A strong indictment of international drug trafficking and its myriad causes, ""Maria Full of Grace"" nonetheless is no tract but a perceptive evocation of an appealing young woman undergoing self-discovery under the most dangerous circumstances.  This film may be one of the finest and boldest strokes of drama ever accomplished in the history of cinema.

Lead actress, Catalina Sandino Moreno may be in only her early 20s, but she is able to draw upon her considerable talent and training to create a portrayal that comes from deep within. She has a radiant screen presence that could give Salma Hayek a run for her money. You bleed for her survival and cringe whenever she fails.

In his feature debut Marston reveals that crucial gift of blending acute observation with spontaneity, leavened with humor and compassion. One of the best moments in the film occurs when Maria takes notice of a New York flower shop filled with roses. Marston pauses just long enough for the implications to sink in - and not a second more.

Marston's casting sense is unfailing right down the line. Yenny Paola Vega is Blanca, Maria's best friend, pretty, headstrong, a little chunky, well-meaning but not nearly as smart or nervy as Maria. One of the film's choicest roles falls to Patricia Rae as a kindly New Yorker originally from Colombia herself, who loves her homeland but is glad she fled it, given its present state, and is grateful for the opportunities New York has provided, no matter how hard she and her husband must strive to stay afloat.

The contrast between Maria's hometown and Jackson Heights, Queens, the film's key New York locale, could hardly be more jolting visually, yet they are connected by the universal and eternal day-to-day struggle for survival on the part of those on the lower rungs the socioeconomic ladder. What's more, in its vitality and finesse, ""Maria Full of Grace"" is all of a piece - and both artistically and spiritually itself full of grace.",1135123200,7,2715,4.821505376344086

2119829,5,B0002TT0MS,"Even if you don't know the name of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, you will remember her and her strong acting after watching this stunning drama about ""Maria,"" Columbian girl who becomes a ""mule"" hired by drug dealers. The film is partly suspense, partly drama, but no matter how you categorize this low budget film, you cannot deny the powerful acting of Catelina Sandrino Moreno who grabs your heart from the beginning to the end.

The film slowly builds up its quiet first half set in Columbia, showing the life of 17-year-old Maria (Catalina Sandrino Moreno) who does not seem very happy living there. We are going to see her problems - about her family, work, and boyfriend -- but at the same time we also watch the social conditions seen from the viewpoint of an ordinary girl.

And you may think no ordinary girl would accept the job of becoming a mule. The film, however, convincingly recreates the atmosphere of the place in which there are very few choices left for the ordinary girls like Maria, and an opportunity of becoming a mule comes as if it is a part-time job like babysitting. The guy who offers her a job of delivering something to someone in New Jersey does not look so bad, speaking like her own grandfather. But by the time we see Maria's decision, we realize the strong undercurrent that pushes girls like Maria. She silently and quietly, accepts the job, knowing the dangers of being arrested, or death.

One of the most amazing things about the film is that we come to share the values of Maria while we know that what she does is morally wrong. Of course she knows it is wrong, but she knows (or she thinks she knows) it is the only way left for her. But after the suspenseful travel to New York and the horrible accident she encounters there, Maria is no longer what she was. And her next step should be a more independent one.

[HARROWING DETAILS] You heard the stories of mules bring illegal substances into the countries like America by swallowing them. The film director Joshua Marston, it is reported, has interviewed the women who recounted their own experiences as mules, and the details of the business-like routine of the training to be one are one of the most realistic and harrowing experiences I have ever seen. Not that it is violent. It is painful to see because it is done as if it is nothing.

But the most impressive is the energetic performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who realized a realistic and credible portrait of an ordinary woman in Maria, which defies our easy categorizing of the good and the evil. She could be both good and bad, or strong and weak at the same time, and her powerful acting gives a human's face to the social concern in which humans are often treated as figures or ciphers. Among many merits of the film, the last is the most difficult one to achieve, and for that reason alone, the film and Catalina Sandrino Moreno should be praised..",1134518400,5,2910,4.599229287090559

Maria is an incredibly credible character, she knows that what she is going to do is morally repulsive, she is deeply afraid about the bags in her stomach, yet she has a lot of courage and she finds out her own moral code after all: to have the courage to help people around you and to do the right thing, even if it implies a risk to herself.

Her frustration with limited opportunities and heavy family responsiblities, lead her to accept an offer to serve as a mule, delivering heroine to New York.

Ultimately, Maria Full of Grace provides a vivid, gritty, realistic account of why the drug mules do what they do, where they come from, and what they are about.  The story is sympathetic, but does not make heroes out of these criminals.

The film's strength might be its ultimate weakness.  Maria was so natural.  The story flowed along a very common, well worn route.  Yes, there were some surprises, some defining moments.

2119835,5,B0002TT0MS,"There could be a melodramatic midday movie centre to a film about a young, pregnant, Colombian girl who becomes a drugs courier in order to leave her the crushing hopelessness of life at home. Instead of saccharine coated answers, this story is told with a naturalistic, almost documentary style that is maintained throughout the film.

In her debut film Catalina Sandino Moreno plays Maria with an unforced honesty. Moreno has a luminous, natural beauty you can see been worn away by the hardships in her life. Maria's family depend on her income from a soul-destroying job working in a Bogot cut-flowers factory. Her life gets so bad, Maria's choices begin to run out and she risks everything becoming a drugs `mule'

The most dramatic scene in the film is when Maria is forced to swallow more then sixty pellets of heroin. The gritty details about the swallowing and later excreting of these pellets are excruciating to watch.  It is Maria's grace in spite of this you begin to hold onto, and becomes the anchor of the film.

Making the journey to the USA with Maria is Lucy (Giulied Lopez), a woman who has made the trip before. Unlike Maria, she can swallow a drug pellet with ease. The only pain Lucy shows us is the sadness in her eyes. On the flight they take into New York's JFK are several drug mules. The idea is if the customs officials capture one, they will be pre-occupied enough for the rest to slip through unnoticed.

When disaster does strike, Maria is forced to take steps to protect her family back home in Colombia and her unborn baby by reaching a decision that, one hopes, will mean a better life. Like the rest of the film, even this potentially emotive part of the story is given a direct, and in a way beautiful, honesty.

Although director John Marston cast Colombians to plays Colombians, none of the film was shot in that country. The drug trade has made it one of the most dangerous places on Earth. To portray this upheaval, a big budget Hollywood effort may have been more effective. Maria Full of Grace is instead a personal story about the deadly combination of drugs and dire poverty, which observes, without providing any simplistic answers.",1131321600,,2178,4.68848167539267
2119836,3,B0002TT0MS,"An excellent portrayal of how, after being given several opportunities to back-out, a volunteer drug-runner gets into the U.S., accepts the pay for her crime and then chooses to stay in the country illegally. The movie was very strong until the scene in U.S. Customs. It was there that it began to break down for me.

It is a well acted and a thoughful movie, but it is, in a nutshell, the story of a criminal. The character could very well have been formulating the start-up of her own drug smuggling operation as she walks through the airport at the end. Sure, she most likely was not but I feel that the film ignores personal responsibility for her own actions, and made her out as too much the victim.",1130457600,2,705,4.465116279069767

2119838,5,B0002TT0MS,"This movie entrances you to Maria's plight, from unbearable working conditions, from poverty, from unwanted pregnancy, to a dangerous adventure with the drug underworld, and later to her 'brave new world' in America.  It mesmerizes the viewer in a manner that does not shock but rather beckons us to empathize and discuss.  Its a masterpiece of a movie that plays with our emotions using a subject that is neither glamorous nor family-oriented.

Its amazing that this movie did not become a household event since it deals with the viciousness, the callousness of drugs in an unpatronizing manner, yet its message is powerful.  It forces us to rethink our priorities, and makes us appreciate what we have here in America much more.  If only the same 'kids in America' can appreciate such opportunities instead of falling prey to the same predatory nature of drugs. This movie is a must for parents who need to explain to their budding teenagers the dangers of drugs and fast money.  A must see.  Great acting and directing!  You almost forget that you are actually watching a foreign film, reading the subtitles because you are totally engross with the movie.  Very very good.",1129161600,5,1175,4.9238578680203045
2119839,5,B0002TT0MS,"""Maria Full Of Grace"" is probably one of the hardest films to watch that I've ever laid my eyes on. Not because it is graphical like ""Irrevrsible"" or confusing like ""Mulholland Dr."" but rather because it is so crude, truthful and believable.

It is not a movie about drugs, but a movie about a girl coming of age the hard way, seeing and doing things no one on this earth should have to endure. It is interesting (and difficult, in a way) to see how everything Maria says to anyone is the wrong thing to say, every option she takes is the wrong one to take. What's cruel is that we know that she never had another option. Life dictated all the trouble and Maria has no other choice but to fight back in her own way.

An important thing about this movie is that every actor is from Colombia, so whatever the film lacks in terms of the acting of some of its characters (and it does), it gets it back in realism. The notable exception is Catalina Sandino Moreno, who displays in some shots a remarkable facial resemblance to Salma Hayek. Her acting is so perfect and adjusted that you get the clear impression that she was born to play Maria. In her performance lies much of the secret for this film to work so well. I for one am eager to see more coming from her in the future.

Life can play hideous tricks on everyone and I agree with the previous comment that says we are fortunate to be immune to much of what happens to Maria. ""Maria Full of Grace"" doesn't lose itself to the temptation of exageration and stays true to its premise all the way through. I don't think it wants to teach any higher lesson, except to always keep your chin up in the face of adversity.

Maria was forced to learn things the hard way but most people can learn from Maria. Think about it and cherish that moment.",1128729600,5,1792,4.292899408284024

As an American who lived in Colombia and who currently works in the flower industry (in the US) I know many stories of the laborers who work at farm level.  To most, the US is a goal to be reached but unfortunately some (as portrayed in this movie) have no other choice but to work as a ""mule"".  Maria's story can be the story of any number of people who have been duped into believing that transporting drugs is relatively ""fool-proof"".  I am glad that Catalina Sandino-Moreno and Joshua Marston got the recognition that they deserved in the film industry because the film itself is very well acted and it captivates the viewer.  Unfortunately it is necessary to show Colombia's ugly side in order to tell this story accurately.  Haunting and hopeful.",1127779200,10,829,4.722222222222222
2119841,4,B0002TT0MS,"Three things I'll never be: 1. Colombian. 2. A pregnant teenager. 3. A drug mule. Three things this movie allowed me to experience: see above. I have no idea about the reality of the day-to-day life of teenagers in Colombia, and no knowledge of the inner workings of drug smuggling, but this movie provided a convincing portrait of both.

I was fascinated by the early scenes of Maria just being Maria. The time spent with her boyfriend, at a dance, and with Maria's family made for an interesting film on its own. The movie lets the characters unfold, and there is never the feeling that exposition is happening. By the time we learn Maria is pregnant (I felt I knew before she did), we are deeply committed to the well-being of this character.

The second act of the film has Maria entering the domain of drug smugglers. These scenes show that the reality of the drug trade is far removed from the super-villains of Reagan era drug war propaganda. The movie presents drug smuggling as a brutal and shabby small business that also offers unimaginable opportunities to young people.

For me, the high point of the second act was the tense airplane ride from Colombia to the US. Knowing what Maria carried inside her; that it was both precious and poisonous, and that it could lead to her imprisonment or freedom, I held my breath as the reality of the situation slowly dawned on the characters.

The later scenes, set in the United States, didn't live up to the earlier part of the movie for me. Maria's journey seemed half-fulfilled and I almost wish the movie had ended earlier. However, there are still many powerful moments, such as Maria's confrontation with the sister of another ""mule.""

It showed how ladies in this day and age do not think about whom they lay with and protection.  It showed that individuals do not think about the consequences of smuggling drugs and they do not see the big picture, who will be (ab)using those drugs.

It demonstrated that drug dealers consider their ""mules"" as animals and not as real humans and have little or no consideration for their mules only for the product.

It touches if you have a heart.",1125964800,2,524,4.427083333333333
2119843,5,B0002TT0MS,"Director Joshua Marston made MARIA FULL OF GRACE on a tight budget, but the result is a compelling closely-focused film which documents a segment of the drug trade while managing to avoid the obvious stereotypes. The story centers around the unhappy teenaged rose-worker Maria, played wonderfully by newcomer Catalina Sandino Moreno, who agrees to swallow heroin for transport to New York in return for a big payoff.

The orchestration and consequences of a single drug run from Colombia to New York comprise the main dramatic content of this film. Throughout, Marston pointedly avoids the caricatures commonly found in the drug film genre. Maria, unhappy throughout, is nevertheless not on the edge of desperation when she makes her choice to become a drug mule. The Colombian drug lord is not the menacing figure one might expect, at least as he is portrayed interviewing Maria for the job and preparing her for her journey. Even the U.S. Customs agents in New York, conceivably an irresistible target for filmmakers with a ""message,"" are portrayed as professional and sympathetic.

One is continuously struck by the detailed realism and honesty of the film; Marston insisted upon using only Colombian actors in the roles of Colombians (though he filmed largely in Ecuador), and the other small details of the movie are indicative of the extensive research that went into its making. That the movie made a profound impact in Colombia, where it premiered, testifies strongly to its authenticity. The story is powerful and horrible and realistic, but one can also perceive a hopeful optimism in it by the end.

MARIA FULL OF GRACE is not always an easy film to watch, and some of the more disturbing images are bound to linger on the mind longer than one might wish. Nevertheless, I could not give a stronger recommendation than the one I give for this movie. Every performance in this film is top rate.

The DVD release of MARIA FULL OF GRACE includes the original and international trailers of the film as well as a helpful and enlightening audio commentary from director Joshua Marston.

Her hands ache and bleed, her boss is verbally abusive, and her family (as most seventeen year olds think) don't understand that she wants more out of life. Then one day she meets a young boy who introduces her to a drug runner who hires ""mules"" (women who carry drugs in their stomachs and into the United States) and Maria's life changes drastically.

But is it all for the worst?

That's tough to say. Although we all know the terrible things that happen to these young girls (rapes, the pellets leaking in their stomachs and killing them, being arrested by border agents, etc.), the viewer has kind of a dark sympathy for Maria and her fellow mules. The amount of money they can make in one trip ($5,000) is a simple treasure to them.

It took me a while to review this film simply because it IS so disturbing. The drug trade is a terrible thing that kills people all the time, but in this film we get to see how it benefits one individual ...but at what cost? Emotionally she's nearly torn apart (she has to watch another mule slowly, painfully, die after a drug pellet leaks in her stomach), but it also makes her a stronger person. She has means (via cash) to support herself and, come to find out, her unborn child.

Will Maria remain in America, or return to her family in Columbia and raise her child there while continuing to be a mule? You'll have to watch it and find out.

Both of my parents are colombian and I lived there for approximately 8 years. And no none of us have any affiliations with drug dealers.

I appreciated that Marston also took pains to show that Maria becomes the mule out of her own volition (aided by her own impetuous, rebellious personality), not necessarily because she's poor.

2119854,5,B0002TT0MS,"""Maria Full of Grace"" is a touching, yet at times frightening, film that deserves a wider audience than those of the art house circuit.  Unfortunately, it has always been the case that films wholly or partly subtitled miss out on mass market distribution.  This is a shame.  Many such films, including ""Maria"", are truly excellent and deserve broader accolades than they receive.

The story of ""Maria"" covers the life of Maria Alavarez (brilliantly played by Catalina Sandino Moreno) whose life revolves around providing for her mother, her sister and her sister's baby from the wages she earns dethorning roses in rural Colombia.  She hates her work and her boss.  Ultimately, she quits in frustration.  Coinciding with this, she realises that she is pregnant to her boyfriend who is probably best described as a loser.  Her life seems to have little upside.

Maria's solution is to work as a mule in order to carry heroin from Bogota to New York.  It's a potentially lucrative trade.  She swallows 62 capsules of the drug.  Her journey is troubled as she escapes the authorities in New York simply because she is pregnant and therefore cannot be X-rayed.  She also sees the brutal and unrelenting side of the trade when one of her fellow mules is killed to retrieve the cargo she is carrying in her system.  Life in this business is cheap.

Without revealing the end, it can be said that the film is great.  The characters are very plausible and the film seems to have no special axe to grind.

2119855,5,B0002TT0MS,"MARIA FULL OF GRACE is an ironic film about drug trafficking among young Columbian women.  Within the context of the film lies a buried depiction of the American Dream that only comes at the end of the film.  It is definitely a five star quality independent film that covers unique angles from a basic and complex plotline.  The film centers around a young woman wanting to break out of her conformist life where she works at a factory that makes flowers in order to help her mother support her sister and her sister's child, but she eventually becomes involved with the wrong side of the tracks.  Maria becomes a pregnant teen who looks toward her so-called rebellious friends, who convince her to quit her mundane job at the factor and to deal drugs.

Upon Maria's arrival to New York to delivery the drugs, via her stomach, she meets up with her neighbor from Columbia, Lucy, who  is also one of the scapegoats.  Unfortunately, Lucy does not succeed in completing her mission, and is left to die in a hotel room.  Maria happens to have Lucy's sister's address, and convinces her to bring her in despite the fact that she does not know about the trouble Lucy is in as well as Maria's dealings with drugs.  In the end, Maria finds out that Lucy has been murdered.  She completes her mission, but as she is about to leave to go back to Columbia, she changes her mind.  She walks away from the airport counter heading back to New York City to begin a new life in the United States along with her unborn child.

MARIA FULL OF GRACE appears to be an incomplete film because the narrative runs succinctly.  However, the film doesn't drag at all and will keep viewers interested in knowing what will happen in the next scene.  There's no doubt that the film is covered with much cultural and religious overtones as well main premise of the film  -- survival.  Is it a coming of age film?  Possibly, but from another perspective - a young woman attempting to live on her own terms and having much luck on her side.

The movie starts out well enough, introducing us to Maria and giving us a glimpse of her life in the outskirts of Bogota, but the film breaks down once she and her compatriots board the plane to New Jersey. It was hard enough for me to imagine Maria getting through US customs with her weak story much less surviving this harrowing ordeal.  The director all too obviously sets up each girl as a stereotype for what happens to young women caught in this predicament, and then loses all sight of what he is trying to say as Maria and her friend are left to fend for themselves in New York.

This was obviously a director who felt he had something terribly important to tell, but his inabilility to sufficiently resolve the plot is what brings this movie down.

This movie is about Maria a young woman of 17 years old who finds herself pregnant and tired of her dead end job in a flower factory in rural Columbia, decides to take a job as a ""mule"" ferrying drugs in her stomach from Columbia to the US, and the mishaps that happen there.

While she came from an impoverished rural background. The words ""country bumpkin"" never came to mind.  Oh parts of her were ignorant...but she also had street smarts that most  teenagers don't have. Her instincts for survival were extraordinary.  It was amazing to watch her navigate herself around very tight situations would have paralyzed most other people with fear. She stands up for herself on several occasions but not obnoxiously so. What a refreshing change from the bratty teenagers that usually riddle movies.  I thought she was a fine young woman and I completely admired her.

No one was played in stereotypes. I guess I (living up here in Canada) am used to seeing Hispanics played a certain way. Either as vicious criminals or poor people who are needed to be pitied. I am never treated or shown the pride that they have in themselves. From ""Lucy"" who is too ashamed to see her sister. To the drug dealer in Columbia who actually gives Maria enough money to settle her accounts, so that she won't be a liability. There were no one dimensional characters in the lot.

Of course I agree with everyone for saying  that Catalina Moreno was terrific.  She certainly deserved her Oscar nomination for best actress (should have won in my opinion).

This is a great movie and it is very uplifting and ended up on my top five favorite movies of 2004. I really hope to see more of Catalina Moreno down the road.",1113350400,2,1871,4.565868263473054

This remarkable film does so many things well, it's hard to catalog them...but I'll try anyways.

First, the depiction of life in Colombia, and how simple/necessary it is to become involved in the drug trade, is effortlessly but exquisitely told. Our heroine has no other options...it's obvious.

Second, the details on, shall we say, ""mule"" training, were enough to make my wife and I both nearly gag in empathy.

Third, the suspense that builds during the initial travel to the U.S. is nerve-rattling.

Fourth, the entry into NY and the harrowing motel scenes, again, are brilliantly but plainly told. I didn't want to blink.

That's all fine and dandy, but the single unifying element that raises this film into the category of something ""really special"" is the performance of Catalina Sandino Moreno.  Miss Moreno presents us with a fully formed, incredibly detailed and nuanced character; there's not a false note in her entire performance. She had me from the moment she appeared until the final fade-out.

Now having seen this movie, there is no question why she was nominated for Best Actress. It's that good.

In an age where sequels are made from the most embarrassing tripe, here is one of those rare films where I would do anything to see what happens after the credits roll.

I believe that this movie really does get into the real nitty-gritty behind the lives of ""mules"" as well as the lives of average everyday people who are trying to earn the means of a better life, in the most dangerous (and illegal) consequences. Sometimes this movie may make you cringe, depressed, overwhelm, and towards the end, make you think. What i loved most about this film, unlike so many films in the industry, is that you actually feel for the characters because for one, they look like average everyday people, not like pin-up dolls from Vogue magazine or something.

2119861,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace is a gripping drama about the decisions we make and the hell we put ourselves through to provide for those we love. First-time writer-director Joshua Marston has crafted a brutally realistic look inside the business of drug mules in such a way that is at times alternately heart-breaking, playful, and gut-wrenching, but always powerful.

Catalina Sandino Moreno plays Maria, a seventeen-year-old girl who works for a Colombian flower distributor, dethorning roses and getting paid very little for a lot of hard work. She works this job to provide for her family, which includes a mother, a grandmother, a sister, and the sister's baby. Maria is often called upon to pay for things for the baby, such as medicine and food, and has come to a point where she is torn between wanting to help and wanting her sister to help herself. Fed up with the mistreatment from her job, she quits, and she also finds out that she is pregnant, but doesn't love her boyfriend Juan (Wilson Guerrero) enough to marry him, and he feels about the same as her.

Maria and her best friend Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega) meet a young man named Franklin (John Alex Toro), and when Maria lets him know that she is trying to find a new job, he offers her an opportunity as a drug mule. He says it's easy work and it pays out big time, so Maria, desperate for the money, agrees to it. All she has to do, she learns, is swallow 62 pellets and fly on a plane to New York, where she will then excrete and deliver them. She is warned that if even one of the pellets bursts, she will die of an overdose. Also going along for the trip are several other girls, including Lucy (Guilied Lopez), who wishes to see her sister in New York, but can't bring herself to go to her apartment, and Blanca, who wants to be just like Maria. When an unexpected tragedy occurs, Maria must run from the drug dealers and find refuge elsewhere, but she must tell a slew of lies along the way.

This film is shot in the gritty style employed by such filmmakers as Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu: the colors are slightly washed out, and the camera is handheld, its shaking giving the proceedings a realistic, documentary-type feel. All of the performances are totally involving, especially Catalina Sandino Moreno, in her first film role, for which she was nominated for an Oscar as Best Actress. She gives Maria an sense of innocence, but not of flawlessness, as she does not always make the right decisions, but her intentions are always well meaning.

The religious parallels are quite obvious to the astute viewer, beginning with the film's title and promotional artwork, which depicts Maria receiving a drug pellet much like holy communion. We've got the name: Maria, otherwise known as Mary; she is a young pregnant girl struggling to find a home. However, this Maria is far from perfect, and definitely not a virgin. This is not to say that the religious imagery is crammed down the viewer's throat; in fact, far from it. Everything in this film seems to unfold naturally, and in my opinion, that is the best way to tell a story.",1112313600,3,3093,4.618181818181818

Within ten minutes of watching, I was in a trance because of Catalina Sandino Moreno.  I had to rewind scenes several times because of the power of her performance - it gave me chills.  She was delicate, bitter, mean, innocent, loving, fearful all at once.  I ended watching the film three times in 24 hours.  I then bought the film and have watched it several times since.

In addition to her amazing performace, Marston's directing is thrilling.  I smoked many cigarettes while sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next to Maria.  This was my favorite movie of 2004.",1111708800,7,730,4.46969696969697

The initial half of the film reminded me of the excellent El Norte (which was about wretchedly poor South American workers desparately trying to make it to the US in search of a better life). Like the protagonists in the other film, Maria, who's been trapped by birth and circumstance, undertakes a desperate risk in an attempt to escape her deplorable plight.

Director Joshua Martson should be commended for just letting the human aspect of the story unfold w/o relapsing into mawkishness. The film also seems to be well researched and depicts the logistics of the ""mule"" business in gut wrenching detail (no pun intended).

This is a harrowing and thought provoking film and very easily one the year's best films.",1111104000,4,990,4.951807228915663
2119864,4,B0002TT0MS,"Plot descriptions have been given, so I'll focus on my thoughts regarding the film.

This film was a touching and emotional story, believable and sad. Why sad? Sad because Maria was expected to support her daughter's child and her mother, sad because her boss was a jerk, and sad because the only job for her in the vicinity was the flower factory. Where else would she find work to do everything she needed to do?

Particularly harrowing - and deftly handled - were the scenes dealing with the ingestion of the drug packets. I tried to imagine doing it myself, and had a difficult time, knowing that one mistake could kill me. These girls must have been truly desperate to become mules. I can't possibly imagine their destitution.

Part of me wanted to see more of the dirty side of the drug business. It seemed too clean. The dealers in Columbia, although they did make slightly veiled threats, came off as nice and amiable. Perhaps they are - I have no clue. The receivers in the U.S. seemed to be more of the real thing, given their callous reactions to the three girls, and what they did to Lucy, of course. What was very unbelievable, however, was that they actually gave the girls their money when the girls ran away with the drugs. They had no obligation to do so, they could have kept the money for themselves, nobody would have given them a hard time, so why'd they do it? For that matter, why did the girls run off with the drugs in the first place? I understand that when a person is confronted with a horrific scene, as Maria and Blanca were when they saw what happened to Lucy that all logic can fly out the window, but surely there had to be some understanding that if they fled with the drugs (and why would they do that anyway?) they would be endangering not only themselves, but their families back in Columbia. After all, there were the veiled (but undoubtedly fully understood) threats.

Also, although was labeled as being rebellious by her boss and by her family - their perceptions, and absolutely incorrect - I saw her as a very kind and decent person. I thought that her acquiescence to becoming a mule was too quick. I wish that Maria

I love this movie but it's quite tragic and tough to sit thru sometimes because of the harrowing subject matter.

2119870,5,B0002TT0MS,"It's always interesting when a newcomer or a little well known actor/actress comes out with a film and just astonishes people, moreso when they find out that the newcomer is quite young. Such is the way with Catalina Sandino Moreno, the main character of this film and interestingly, the first Oscar nomination for someone of Columbian descent.

In Columbia, Catalina's character Maria works in a flower plantation de-thorning roses before they're shipped out. Her boss is pretty much an ass, she has a very loser boyfriend that ends up getting her pregnant and her family relies on her completely for money, including her sister who has a son.

She meets a guy that offers her a job: travel to New York with close to 60-70 thumb sized pellets in your stomach and get through US customs without getting detected. Deliver the pellets and you'll get paid a large sum of money. These pellets however contain heroin, and if one breaks or dissolves in their stomach, it will mean death. She meets up with Lucy, someone who's done it before and has to deal with Blanca, her friend who also ingested the pellets and is tagging along.

One nice thing about Catalina's performance is that she's playing the role like someone calling out to the audience and not demanding sympathy. She does things that are quite bad, she's a bit naive at times yet somehow you feel sympathetic towards her and want her to come out clean in the end despite her actually going through with being a mule. I'm hoping she doesn't turn out like Carrie Henn from Aliens who did quite a great job for a little girl but didn't make another film afterwards.

It's not a typical Hollywood film, it is in subtitles and it's not the most happiest of topics but Catalina's performance makes it stand out(too bad she lost the Oscar to that damn Swank girl, bah).",1109635200,2,1821,4.663551401869159
2119871,4,B0002TT0MS,"What type of performance would it take for a teenage girl in a Spanish-speaking film debut to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress?  This type.

Catalina Sandino Moreno flames the screen as the resourceful and practical Maria.  This character makes some difficult choices - some would say the ""badness"" that occurs to these young women are only just desserts, but Joshua Marton's film does an excellent job of portraying the type of desperate poverty in Columbia that would make a young woman consider desperate choices.  Maria is working in a warehouse stripping thorns from roses that are being shipped overseas when she meets a young braggart who introduces her to men who are smuggling heroin into the U.S. by packaging them into horse-pill pellets, wrapping them in the fingers of latex gloves, then having ""mules"" carry them into the U.S. in their digestive tract. Maria flies over along with 4 other ""mules"" with over 60 of these heroin death-pills in her belly.  If one breaks, death seems a certainty.  Tension mounts palpably - will a pellet break and kill one of the girls?  Will U.S. Customs catch one who arrives on an expensive flight from Colombia with little visible means of support?

The supporting characters are fleshed out as well as the story needs - but the film is carried on the able talents of Moreno.

2119873,5,B0002TT0MS,"I think this is one of the best films of 2004 if not THE best. It tells the story of a young Colombian girl who takes a desperate action of becoming involved in the drug trade. Maria is an independent woman who makes a desperate move to find a better life for herself. She's not perfect, a little too strong-willed, rebellious, and courageous for her own good. The story takes us from Colombia to New York and shows us a part of the world of drug smuggling. The decisions Maria makes ends up affecting others around her and how she deals with the consequences are a core part of the film. Going beyond the story of the drug trade, the film also explores the meaning of being an immigrant to the U.S. and the choices one makes once in this country.

I agree with a previous review that said this film sometimes feels like a documentary. Part of it is I feel the natural performances of the actors, many of whom are not professional, and some who have just limited experience. One of my favorite scenes is one where Maria is having an argument with her boyfriend. You almost feel like an eavesdropper watching these two wrestle with their dilemma. It's a scene that could be happening in many places everyday. Both performances are outstanding.

Another great feature of the DVD is the director's commentary. I think Joshua Marston gives us a balanced look at how and why the film was made instead of spending all of the time getting into the nitty gritty details of the shoot like what kind of lenses he used and why this brand of film is better than that, etc. like some commentaries do. Not all of us are film school students. Instead he provides some information about Columbia, about life there, about how he found his actors, and what he learned during the making of the film.

Two other films I could recommend are: ""Dirty Pretty Things"", a thriller directed by Stephen Frears that looks through the eyes of desperate immigrants in London; and ""Raising Victor Vargas"", a low budget independent film  dealing with Hispanic immigrants in NYC but instead of the heavy overtones of the drug storyline, it deals with themes of family and teen romance.",1109203200,3,2151,4.59375
2119874,5,B0002TT0MS,"Catalina Sandino Moreno recently won a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her stunning portrayal of Maria in Joshua Marston's ""Maria Full of Grace."" This was a debut performance for Ms. Sandino Moreno, a native of Bogot&aacute;, Colombia, who developed an interest in acting while in high school. She subsequently studied theater and acting and caught Marston's eye when she auditioned for this part. He took a risk by casting the inexperienced young actress as Maria and, in return, she delivered - bringing tremendous depth to the complex and demanding role.

Seventeen year-old Maria Alvarez works on a flower plantation outside Bogot&aacute;, stripping thorns off roses in preparation for shipping. It's a dead-end job and her future doesn't look to improve much. A spirited, independent young women, with a sense of adventure, she is obviously bored with the work and her abusive supervisor, disenchanted with her immature boyfriend, and fed-up with her family, which receives almost her entire paycheck. When Maria discovers she is pregnant, she accepts the offer to carry drugs to the US as a mule. There is no way, however, that she could have imagined the nightmarish and threatening world she becomes involved with.

Films about the drug trade abound, from this year's ""El Rey,"" (also up for an Academy Award), to ""Traffic,"" ""Veronica Guerin,"" ""Trainspotting,"" ""Blow,""  even 1971's extraordinary ""The French Connection,"" to name a few. However, ""Maria Full of Grace"" offers a totally different perspective on the business of drugs and drug smuggling. Even though the primary focus is on the mules here, a much broader picture is portrayed. It is painful, and extremely intense, to watch the desperate Maria force herself to swallow almost 70 thumb-sized pellets filled with finely powered heroin. She takes medication first to slow her digestion, all the while under the watchful eye of her runner. The danger of discovery and death is ever present, as is the potential risk to her family if anything goes wrong. A Colombian mule can earn between $5000. to $8000. per trip. Considering that the average annual per capita income is around $2,000, one gets a general understanding of why the girl might imperil herself to this extent. I felt a terrible sense of sadness throughout much of the movie. This particular film does conclude on a hopeful note, I think - for Maria anyway.

Marston, who directed from his own script, takes us through the entire harrowing run in a manner so realistic that I felt I was watching a documentary at times. The building tension on the commercial plane flight to New York had me literally on the edge of my seat. And Catalina Sandino Moreno is a natural - absolutely gifted! This film is outstanding - certainly
one of the best movies to be made on the subject. The supporting cast also deserves kudos, with special mention to Yenny Paola Vega, who plays the tenacious Blanca, and to Orlando Tobon - who is not a professional actor. His character, Don Fernando, is taken from fact not fiction. In Jackson Heights, Queens, Orlando Tobon is called the ""mayor of Little Colombia."" He makes his living as an accountant and travel agent, but he also serves his community as a social service counselor and all-purpose guide to many of the thousands of Colombian immigrants who come to live in his ethnically diverse Queens neighborhood. Tobon is also known as ""the undertaker of the mules"" for his work helping families repatriate the remains of Colombians who die smuggling drugs into New York.

2119875,4,B0002TT0MS,"Mara is a young Colombian girl, pregnant and poor, and at a dead end in life. She quitted a job she didn't like, but couldn`t find another one in her little town. As her family depended heavily on the money she earned, she has to go to Bogot, ""the big city"", to find employment. But on the way to Bogot a person she met in a party offers her what at first sight seems an easy solution: to transport drugs to the United States in her body.

Easy?. Well, other adjectives come to mind when you think about that idea: desperate, foolish, ill-advised, irresponsible, rash and senseless, but never easy. That is something that Mara will learn as she discovers that being a ""mule"" isn't simple. First she needs to learn how to swallow the pellets with cocaine, and is informed of the fact that she will die immediately if one of the pellets explodes in her stomach. Then, Mara has to survive to the fear of being caught by the police, and to the death of another ""mule"" that became her friend at the hands of the men who were supposed to receive the cocaine.

Will Mara die too?. What will happen to her?. You will learn that when you watch ""Mara full of grace"". Strangely enough, you will care for what happens with the impetuous Mara, because this movie will allow you to understand what kind of situation can convince someone to become a drug smuggler. Despite that, understanding the reasons for a decision doesn't mean justifying it, and I don't.

All the same, I think writer/director Joshua Marston should be congratulated on a movie well done, that gives a human face to the ""mules"" that help drug lords to smuggle drugs. We come to realize that sometimes the mules are the victims of extraordinarily bad decisions that they cannot correct in time due to threats to their families, and fear. Catalina Sandino Moreno as Mara conveys very believable what a person is likely to feel, in such a difficult situation.

On the whole, I really liked this movie, even though at times it was difficult to watch due to the emotional agony some of the characters transmited. ""Mara full of grace"" won't make you smile, but it will make you think. That is sometimes enough, isn't it ?.

 employ them as human mules to transport their heroin to the U.S.  What seems like easy money to these impressionable impoverished young women turns out to be perilous as they make the trek with these balloons full of deadly drugs lodged in their stomaches.  The film's primary focus is on Maria Alvarez(Catalina Sandino Moreno) a seventeen year-old pregnant girl who tires of her job as a flower cutter in a rustic Colombian town living with her extended family of single mothers.  What initially seems glamorous soon takes on ominous overtones.  The film takes place in a matter of a few days, however, with the potentially life-threatening experiences that Maria endures her demeanor takes on what seems like years.  Moreno more than earns her recent Oscar nomination for a performance of great subtlety.  She is more than up to the demands of the intricasies of the changes that Maria's character goes through.

After all, it can't be all that bad...right? Well, I'm not going to blab away any plot points, but Catalina Sandino Mareno embodies the drab, as well as the strong; ultimately the outraged and determined heroine of this disturbing film. To me, the ugliness of the drug situation wasn't made ugly enough. Mr. Marston chose brevity over outrage, and hit all the right marks. He relied on Ms. Moreno to convey, and his choice was dead-on. This brillant young actress (23 at the time, playing a 17 year old) has a formidable career ahead of her. Will she win the Oscar? Probably not. I think it'll be another slug-fest between Swank & Bening, and no one's seen Staunton (who should win); and don't discard Winslet, who's outrageously energetic performance can't be discarded (she's also been nominated, and lost, more than the others).Despite idiot choices by the Academy in the past, it's comforting to know that true excellence is being recognized.

2119880,4,B0002TT0MS,"The day after I watched the DVD of MARIA FULL OF GRACE, it's star, Catalina Moreno, was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. I guess my viewing put her over the top.

Catalina plays Maria, a 17-year old Colombian whose life is in the dumpster. She's pregnant by her worthless boyfriend; she quits her job de-thorning rose stalks after her male boss won't let her leave the assembly line to go to the loo and vomit; her mother and self-centered sister, the latter also an unwed mother, berate her for abandoning the major portion of the family's earning power. What's a poor girl to do? Why, of course, go to Bogota and volunteer to become a ""mule"", i.e., someone who jets into the United States with his/her belly full of miniature sausage-shaped baggies of cocaine. After practicing swallowing large, red grapes - I would have picked those little cocktail weenies - off she goes to New York with sixty-something of the packets onboard and the promise of $5,000 when she delivers. And, as the drug middleman warns her, don't lose any on the way because ""we know where your family lives"". In any case, Maria finds herself on the international flight with three other mules. Only one comes back.

With her Oscar nomination as Best Actress, is Moreno in the same league with the likes of Imelda Staunton (VERA DRAKE), Annette Benning (BEING JULIA), and Hilary Swank (MILLION DOLLAR BABY)? Most assuredly not. Perhaps her inclusion represents the relative dearth of great female screen performances in 2004; there's little from which to choose. However, having said that, Catalina's performance is a very fine one, especially for one so new to the Biz. A golden statue is within her reach in the future.

The creators of MARIA FULL OF GRACE remained disingenuously neutral throughout about the morality of the drug trade. Rather, the film focuses on the unremarkably commonplace economic pressures that pushed Maria, ostensibly a young and intelligent woman of otherwise average morality, into a venture that subsequently caused her so much anguish, mortal fear, and inconvenience. One would hope that the experience would make her a vocal DARE advocate, but perhaps that's too much to expect in today's world.

The movie especially benefits from good, understated, naturalistic performances across the board.  The DVD features a fine, crisp image and a few modest extras.",1107129600,2,702,4.982905982905983
2119882,3,B0002TT0MS,"According to the director's commentary, Joshua Marston's original inspiration for his movie ""Maria Full of Grace"" was reading an article about Columbian drug mules risking their lives to transport drugs into the United States. He then sat down at his computer, and in a fevered rush, wrote the screenplay for the movie in two days. The end result has wonderful intentions, and a mesmerizing performance by Catalina Sandino Moreno who plays Maria, with the end result being somewhat disappointing.

The most wonderful thing about this movie is the main character of Maria, a headstrong flower worker with big problems in her familia. Her life in Colombia is less than ideal, with a boyfriend who's a lout who manages to inpregnate her quickly. She quits her job, drawing the ire of both her sister and mother who depend on the cash to live. In searching for another job, she happens on a young motorcycle rider with connections to Columbia's drug world, and convinces her ultimately to become a drug mule. Thus begins her journey.

Maria, played flawlessly by the impressive and beautiful Catalina Sandino Moreno, is headstrong and purposeful. As Maria encounters problems entering the United States by some suspicious immigration officers, she is brilliant enough to lie convincingly, while having luck turn in her favor. Navigating herself through New York, unable to speak the language, she manages to keep herself and her friend Bianca away from some Columbian baddies. Maria relies on herself through this film, and it's refreshing to watch how she manages such a task.

However, the script somewhat lets down the film. For example, the plane ride over to New York has some scenes of suspense, but they were somewhat downplayed to advance the story along. The potentially edginess of being hunted by the Columbian drug runners in New York City is somewhat downplayed to advance Maria's decision she makes at the end of the film. This film had the great potential to put Maria in much more danger than it did. Perhaps the screenwriter felt protective of Maria and didn't want to endanger her any more than he did. But perhaps if he did, the film would have been stronger overall.

The film does manage to show how an innocent girl manages to make a decision to become a drug mule, and how the policies of the United States in the drug war are ineffective at best. ""Maria Full of Grace""'s scope is a bit wide, but the net cast by Catalina Sandino Moreno in her role of Maria will be a portend of great things to come from her.",1106438400,4,2528,4.817972350230415

All of them have limited futures, and Maria seems to sense that she is definitely on the road to nowhere.

Maria is sick of her demanding family, as she sees that her sister, who does nothing to contribute to her family's welfare, is treated better by their mother than she is. Maria is also tired of her job at the flower plantation, where she is treated little better than a serf. Pregnant by her boyfriend but unwilling to enter into a loveless marriage with him, she is introduced to Franklin (John Alex Toro), a seemingly more worldly young man than she is accustomed to meeting.  It is he who introduces her to the high risk job of being a drug mule to the United States. The money, five thousand dollars, is far more than Maria is accustomed to earning, and, suddenly, the inherent risks seem to fade into the background.  It seems to the pregnant Maria that the whole world could be her oyster.

The film gives a very explicit birds-eye view of the life as a drug mule. It shows the viewer just how the process works, from the swallowing of the encapsulated drugs to their eventual evacuation from the drug mule's body. It also shows what can happen when the drugs leak into the mule's system.  Of course, when dealing with illicit drugs, one is also forced into interacting with drug dealers. In her brief career as a drug mule, Maria is faced with all of these situations, as is her best friend, Blanca, who against Maria's advice, also makes the journey to the United States, stomach bloated with drugs, along with two other girls.

Once in flight, there are signs of things not going as smoothly as planned. When they land, further complications arise. These increase, once they are in the drug dealer's lair, and the evacuation process begins. Unfortunately, the worst case scenario presents itself, and Maria reacts in a way that has the potential for extreme ramifications for her and her family. Maria, however, is a survivor by nature. When the danger is averted, and the time comes for her return home, Maria makes a last minute decision that will forever change her life and that of her unborn child.

Catalina Sandino Moreno is a natural, and it does not hurt that she is also beautiful. Her portrayal of Maria is sensitive, yet, strong and compelling. She is, indeed, full of grace. She is also the linchpin around whom the entire film revolves, and she certainly is up to the job. The screenplay is tautly written with just the right amount of tension. Moreover, Joshua Marston's deft direction, as well as the stellar performances by the entire cast, adds up to a superlative film that should not be missed.",1105920000,4,3416,4.805792163543441
2119886,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria for of Grace is an amazing, powerful movie.  The thing that blew me away was the source of the power was the fact that it is like a documentary -- people in columbia really do live 10 to an apartment in a tenament, work for $0.50 an hour doing back breaking labor for an inhuman boss, and try to find a better life as a ""mule.""  This adds a poignancy to all of Maria's actions that is absent from most Hollywood blockbusters: what you see is real, and it is gripping.

If you like this movie, check out City of God.  It's on par with this one, and deals with a similar plot involving what it's like to live in true poverty.",1105920000,,629,4.0894308943089435
2119887,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace is an extraordinary story depicting a young Colombian woman's struggle for hope, dreams, and a better life, which was written and directed by Joshua Marston.  The film is disturbing and dark and it may be fiction, but it certainly provides some haunting images of the dark nature of humanity.  For some, this is maybe one of the best films this year--and it may very well be one of the best films.

Colombian people work hard in order to sustain life.  The shifts are long and grueling without unions that see that they employees are being treated humanely and are paid an amount worth their work.  Instead the companies set the rules, which are in enforced by foremen that could more or less be compared to slave drivers as the workers are paid substantially less than poverty wage.  These slave drivers constantly remind the workers that they must fill their quota in order to get paid and often provide false information in regards to the company profits.  The 17 year old Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) has such a job at a company where she cuts long-stemmed roses where she constantly cuts her fingers while being harassed by the foreman about her production.  The day comes when Maria finally has had enough of this work and she quits as she was not allowed to visit the bathroom when she felt sick.

Shortly after Maria has quit her job she enters a pharmacy with her mother and sister as her sister's son has taken ill.  The mother demands Maria's pay as they must pay for the medicine for the little boy, but Maria wonders why she has to give away her hard earned money to her sister to which her mother comments, ""Why do you have to be so difficult?""  In anger Maria hands the money to her mother as she mentions that she quit her job.  After some discussion the mother says, ""At least it's a decent job."", and Maria coldly responds ""Please, what's decent about it?""  Yes, Maria is difficult as she does not comply to the socially learned values by being a good girl and following the patriarchal rules of the Catholic Church as she comes from a one parent home.  However, Maria's rebellion seems to originate from her perceptive view of the Colombian society and the injustice within it as she noticed her unjust treatment at the flower company, unlike her mother and sister that simply accept their place in poverty.

Discovering the absence of two periods cautions Maria to suspect that she is pregnant.  Maria informs the father, Juan (Wilson Guerrero), about the probable pregnancy to which he responds that they have to get married.  Again Maria rebels as she asks if Juan loves her, but he cannot say those words.  Resentfully Maria displays her dislike for Juan's lack of affection, and decides that a marriage will never take place, which is against the Catholic values she has been brought up to cherish.

Maria dreams and hopes of something better so while being uneducated and standing pregnant on her own two feet she begins to seek alternative means of making a living.  Through a friend Maria meets Franklin who introduces her into becoming a mule.  A mule is a drug trafficking person who transports several dozen pellets full of potent illegal drugs in their stomach.  If one pellet breaks it will lead to certain death.  Thus, becoming a mule means that what is inside the stomach of the mule is more important to the criminals than the life of the person carrying the drugs.  Knowing this, Maria begins rehearsing the swallowing of pellets in order to prepare for her drug trafficking trip to New York, which could be the door to a better life.

Maria Full of Grace is strong film that clearly opens up a door that will let out several social issues as it also sends a strong political message.  The drug trafficking is visually revolting and nauseating, and will probably lead to emotional turmoil within the audience as they follow Maria and the other mules experience.  Cerebrally the story is much more horrifying in regards to how people are treated as they are willing to go to great lengths to put themselves in such danger.  The film has some similarities with Lukas Moodysson's Lilja 4-ever (2002) where a teenage girl is left in Estonia by her mother who immigrates to United States while the girl is being lured into sex slavery in Sweden.  Both films depict a teenager trying to find a better life for themselves as they fly to a new country under illegal circumstances.

The sadness that Maria Full of Grace provides is not in the film, but in it's depiction of what the reality is for many people who take these risks.  Catalina Sandino Moreno does a brilliant job in highlighting the sad truth by providing a raw and poignant performance as Maria.  This performance offers an authentic perspective on the emotional suffering a dangerous journey can cause as Maria is forced into situations that could possibly be the end of her and her family's lives.  Marston's direction elevates the genuine atmosphere as each scene simply brings a visual impression of Maria's mere existence as she makes mistakes to which she quickly adapts using her street smarts.",1105747200,2,5126,4.723595505617977
2119888,5,B0002TT0MS,"When I rented this film, I wasn't sure if the overall film was going to be a ""downer"". It just seemed like the overall topic and story of the film was going to be depressing, but that's not the case. Not entirely.

Essentially it's about a teenage girl wanting to get out of a dead end life in Columbia, where the only job worth working at is picking roses, for an unsympathetic boss. The little money she makes goes towards her sister's baby, and the frustration to leave grows. Even though it's a dead end town (funny that New Jersey factors into the film), they still manage to have fun.

Maria takes a ride with a ""slick"" (for small town) guy into Bogota where she planned to take a maid job, but instead got sidetracked into shipping drugs as a ""mule"". She befriends a girl named Lucy when she meets the drug dealer. He doesn't come off as the stereotypical druglord, but more fatherly, however he does lay down the law with her.

The incentive is that all she has to do is go over for a week, and when she comes back, she'd have enough money to buy a house.

Maria is pregnant from her boyfriend, who is just young and still into hanging with friends, and content to be as he is. I wouldn't say he was a ""loser"", but was more content with being there.

Her best friend Blanca is more of a pain and ""tag-along"" than anything else, but winds up going along with Maria to be a ""mule"" carrying pellets of coke.

The 3 girls go on the plane to New York/New Jersey, and the real adventure begins. Even though they are in another country, there are aspects of home there as well...

The film isn't as harsh as ""Amores Perros"", the tone and theme of the film could be compared to ""Real Women Have Curves"", where both main characters center around young girls coming of age and escaping their families, although in radically different ways.

The characters in the film are realistic and sympathetic, there are no stereotypical good or bad guys, the bad guys come off more as ""doing their job"" than anything else.

I feel it's worth watching more than once and if you're a fan of Latino Cinema, a good story and independent films, it's an essential.",1105574400,6,2145,4.396464646464646
2119889,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full Of Grace has earned a place among my all time favorite films. The actors were remarkably believable in their delivery, in fact, I often forgot they were supposed to be ""acting"". This is, perhaps, bolstered by the use of unknown faces - unknown to me, at least. Their investment in making their roles as authentic as possible left me feeling that, for some of them, this was more than just another film. Maybe they were hoping it would be a launchpad to fame, maybe they really believed in the story or maybe some of them weren't acting at all. Maybe the subject matter was more personal than we, as the audience, can fathom. Simply put, there wasn't a weak character in the bunch. Regardless of their motivation, the product was the end-to-end display of top notch storytelling. Films and actors like these that reinvigorate my belief in the power of moving pictures.

The subtleties presented in this film add to the depth. The story shows the four paths in such a life: Tragic death (Lucy), imprisonment (the nameless 'curly-haired' woman), entrapment (Blanca) or escape (Maria); It's worth noting that Lucy was regarded as a bit of a 'veteran' after only two missions. This hints at very short careers for Las Mulas. It's unlikely that Blanca, with her lack of rugged sense, will last as long as Lucy did; In both her jobs, dethorning roses and smuggling cocaine, Maria was toiling away for the benefit of wealthy people who'd never know her name; I'm neither Catholic nor Christian, so I'm sure much of the symbolism presented herein is lost on me, but I trust it would be of importance to others who are more informed in that regard.

Upon the introduction of a new character I'd expect the new face to amount to little more than a convenient stereotype or caricature inserted to move the story along or to provide an easy villain. Much to the credit of everyone involved, they sidestepped my cynical expectations and delivered compelling, complex characters that each had an intriguing, yet unspoken, background that is likely film-worthy in it's own regard. From Blanca to Lucy to Javier to Franklin to Carla to Don Fernando (one of the most intriguing, IMHO) to the women in Maria's family to the US immigration officers, no character was squandered, no emotion overstated and no motive romanticized. I can't praise this film enough. As a man I enjoy seeing stories told from a woman's perspective. I appreciate being forced to think about matters from a different point of view and this film did so expertly. I also appreciate the appearance of under-represented populations. It's easy to turn remote groups into faceless ethnicities or nationalities. Films like this one give us the opportunity to learn about other lifestyles and, hopefully, become more understanding and perhaps compassionate in response. I hope to see more from everyone associated with this film. This is a DVD to purchase and watch repeatedly.",1105315200,5,2936,4.893574297188755
2119890,4,B0002TT0MS,"Wonderfully shot on location in Columbia, Ecuador and New York City, ""Maria Full of Grace"" tells the story of a young woman, bored with life on a flower plantation, seeking the easier money of the drug trade. She quits her job dethorning roses and agrees to act as a ""mule"" for a cabal of drug dealers. The film is mainly interesting for its depictions of the trials that are part-and-parcel of her decision: learning to swallow marshmallow-sized ""pellets"" of latex-wrapped cocaine and heroin; trying to keep the pellets down during a long flight to the US; encounters with suspicious customs officials and vicious drug handlers. The film gives us a fascinating look  at the Columbian community in New York, showing us drug enforcers, immigrants working form better lives for their children, as well as neighborhood fixers who help their countrymen through the vicissitudes of adjusting to American life.

As a window into a world I did not know, ""Maria Full of Grace"" was extraordinary in spite of a few limitations. The acting (especially on the part of Catalina Sandino Moreno, who played the film's heroine, Maria Alvarez) was underplayed to the extent of woodenness. The film also lost a chance to show the other end of the drug trade -- those who use the product Maria was smuggling. Yet the film is successful in tracing the path of one young woman from an unfulfilling life, through a journey through hell, to what one hopes is a more auspicious future.",1105315200,2,1461,4.863453815261044

2119892,5,B0002TT0MS,"Set in Colombia, Maria Full of Grace focuses on the choice an independent-minded pregnant teenager makes in order to escape a stifling home situation, a heading-no-where boyfriend situation, boredom, and lack of other opportunities. She agrees to be a mule, a drug runner, for lots and lots of money. The process of swallowing the large capsules is described in such detail that you nearly gag along with her as she struggles to get the hang of it, knowing she will die of a heroin overdose should one break.

Turns out there are 4 female mules on her flight from Bogot to NYC. Only 3 make it thru Customs, and only 2 survive to carry on with their lives.

The lead role of Maria is played to perfection by Catalina Sandrino Moreno, an actress whose face conveys all her inner conflicted feelings with a bare minimum of movement.

2119893,3,B0002TT0MS,"I'm sure Columbians have a completely different perspective on this movie.  I understand and accept that.  I'm not saying anyone else's review is wrong.  But being an American, seeing the movie in America with English subtitles, I feel I have every right to review it with from an American perspective.  So I'll give my thoughts on what would have otherwise been a too-slowly paced movie.

First, what surprised me the most was the movie's positive view of the United States.  The last thing I ever expected out of an HBO-affiliated film was soft-core pro-America propaganda, but there it was.  Now, as a policy matter I'm not sure I'm in favor of a teenage drug mule ditching her family to come to America and have her illegitimate child at taxpayer expense, but hey, I'm honored she'd even consider it.

Second, I thought the movie did a wonderful job showing the bottom of the drug supply food chain.  We have seen some great movies of life at the top of organized crime (e.g., The Godfather) and also at the working class level (e.g., ""Good Fellas"").  This one definitely has a bird's eye view of the working poor in the drug trade.  It answers the questions Who, Why and How of drug mules with a verisimilitude that astounds (the When, Where and What we already knew).  That makes the movie worth watching.

Also, great acting. Ms. Moreno is outstanding and utterly believable.",1105056000,2,1382,4.7322175732217575
2119894,5,B0002TT0MS,"A film by Joshua Marston

Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) de-thorns roses at a flower plantation in a small Colombian town.  She recently learned that she is pregnant by her boyfriend whom she does not love nor does he love her.  After being poorly treated by her employer, Maria quits her job and needs to find work.  Maria helps to support her family, which includes her sister and nephew.  Her sister doesn't work.  The only job options are to return to the flower plantation or travel many miles away to get work in a city.  She meets a young man named Franklin (John Alex Toro) who suggests another option: Maria could work as a mule.

A mule is the person who transports drugs from Colombia to America.  In the case of the mules in ""Maria Full of Grace"", the mules swallow 60 or more pellets filled with heroin and transport the drugs inside of the mule.  There is still great risk: the mule can still be caught by customs and submit to an X-Ray which will reveal the pellets; a pellet can break open inside the mule, essentially sentencing the person to death; or the mule can lose a pellet by using the bathroom.  Losing a pellet can result in horrible consequences for the family of the mule, as the drug lord threatened Maria and her family.  American may be the Land of Opportunity, but ""Maria Full of Grace"" shows why a Colombian girl with no criminal leanings would choose to enter this life.  The opportunities are simply not there in Colombia.  A mule could buy a house for her family with just one paycheck.

This film does not shy away from graphically showing us what can happen to those who traffic drugs across the border.  We see every possible consequence to being a mule, from the good to the horribly bad.  While Joshua Marston does not hand us a moral judgment on Maria, I don't see that there is any way that he is giving any sort of approval to the life of a mule, either. I just know that those characters which chose to continue in that life are not going to have an easy or very long life.  Sooner or later time and reality will catch up.  The mule is a beast or burden and will not long live a life of luxury.

Catalina Sandino Moreno did a fantastic job as Maria.  It is difficult to believe that this was only her first role in a movie (much like Bryce Dallas Howard in ""The Village"", only this movie is actually good).  Moreno is so self assured in ""Maria Full of Grace"", but also frightened or unsure when circumstances call for it.  We get why a basically moral young woman would make the decision she did.  For Maria being a mule is not entering a life of crime, but rather an opportunity in a land of no opportunities.  Moreno truly is the star of this movie and I would love to see her nominated for this performance.

""Maria Full of Grace"" is one of the year's best films and it is moving, heartbreaking, and even uplifting.  Second time director Joshua Marston looks to have a very good future ahead of him if he can keep making movies as good as ""Maria Full of Grace"".  The story and the performances really make this foreign language movie shine.  Grade: A

2119895,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace is a superb film. The story of how a young girl from the Columbian countryside becomes a drug ""mule"" for a drug cartel is realistic and frightening.  The acting of all the characters were great but Catalina Sandino Moreno playing the role of Maria was exceptional. Maria is a strong willed independent young woman, which in some ways leads her into extreme risk with drug dealers in Bogota. However her strong will also saves her in the end as she escapes from the web strung around her and other young women like her. The film draws you into her situation and is suspenseful throughout. I knew that people smuggled drugs into the US in their stomachs but this film gives you all the gory uncomfortable details. This was one of the best films of 2004!",1104710400,5,771,4.546762589928058
2119896,5,B0002TT0MS,"This 2004 Independent film has won all kinds of awards and I can well understand why.  It deals with a subject that I've been vaguely aware of and brings it up close and personal.  And it does it so well that I felt I was right inside the film, feeling the pressures of a young Columbian woman as she makes her choice to smuggle drugs into the United States.

We first meet Maria in her native land, where she works all day picking roses and preparing them for export.  In spite of the beauty of the flowers, it is physical labor with an unfeeling boss who won't even let Maria go to the bathroom when she needs to.  Her family needs the few pesos she earns and are upset when she quits her job.  But she has another secret.  She's pregnant.  And her boyfriend is a real loser.  She refuses to marry him and leaves her small town to look for work in Bogot.  Immediately she's recruited to be a ""mule"", swallowing rubber pellets filled with a white powder and then boarding a passenger plane to America.  The audience then gets to see exactly what this means.  Maria is told not to eat anything for 24 hours.  Then she is given some sort of anesthetic to keep her intestines quiet.  And then, with grueling realism, we watch as she gags and chokes and eventually swallows 63 of these pellets which look about 2 inches long and an inch or so wide.  We also meet her traveling companions, one of which is Lucy, who has made the trip on two different occasions and teaches Maria how to practice swallowing grapes so she learn to do the task.  There's also her best friend, Blanca, from the flower factory. The plane ride is a horror.  And when she goes to the bathroom and expels a pellet, she has to re-swallow it again.

But that is not the end of the story.  Eventually Maria does make it through and is taken to a motel in New Jersey.  And her experience with the young men whose job it is to get the pellets after they are expelled is a nightmare.  He friend Lucy gets sick, very sick.

Maria and Blanca eventually make their way to Jackson Heights in the Borough of Queens.  She has an address of Lucy's sister.  Life in America is hard for the sister who is married and pregnant, but she agrees to let Maria and Blanca stay with her.  Now Maria gets a little bit of a taste of America.  It is very strange to her.

An unknown actress named Catalina Sandino Moreno plays the role of Maria.  She is fabulous.  And, I understand that in the Berlin Film Festival she tied with Charlize Theron (Monster) for best actress.  Everyone in the cast is wonderful though and so is the directing and cinematography.  There was tension in every scene and I felt I was right there with her, experiencing the drug world as this cast of characters does.  There are no guns or big money displayed in this film.  It's only about the little people who are caught in the drug world's web.  This is a fine film and the fact that I found myself retching as I watched it, only reinforces its realism.

Highly recommended, but not for anyone with a weak stomach.",1104278400,2,3040,4.339253996447602
2119897,5,B0002TT0MS,"Rarely does a film make you examine your own life situation and get you to appreciate life a little bit more. For all the first born generation in America here, as myself, seeing this film will make you understand a part of your parents motives in coming to the U.S.

The film also helps us understand why some people would risk their lives to smuggle drugs into another country.  You can empathize so much with the character, Maria, that the crime committed seems forgivable, and the only crime seems to be the completely onesided economic imbalance in the world.

The only drawback is this is a very serious film, which for some people would not be markoff. However, for some people it should only be watched when your in the mood for a serious but amazing movie.",1104192000,2,765,4.569343065693431
2119898,5,B0002TT0MS,"I chose this DVD because I'd read so many rave reviews. I thought it would be grim and slow-moving, but in fact the film combines nail-biting suspense with a powerful message.  And it's got the kind of gritty realism you see in Magadalene Sisters -- not sparing any details, but not dramatizing either. Evil can be so mundane.

Other reviewers have summarized the plot extremely well -- no need for another recap.  Marston's Director's Commentary adds a whole new dimension to the viewing experience. He's unabashedly delivering a message. The ""mules"" are often above-poverty people who want to make some serious money and there's no other way. The dealers aren't slimy gangsters but human beings. In fact, the dealer who drafts Maria is a portrayed as a soft-spoken man who asks Maria about her life and her problems -- realistic, says Marston.

I hadn't known the details of mules who carry drugs in their stomachs. But I don't think a PrimeTimeLive or Sixty Minutes spot would capture the feeling we get as we watch Maria forcing herself to swallow pills and her too-full feeling afterward.  The odds aren't good: out of four on this flight, one dies, one gets caught and two have a narrow escape.

Marston wants to portray the characters as three-dimensional. He wants to avoid the bad-guy customs agent and the saintly heroine, and I believe he succeeds.  The casting is a brilliant combination of professionals and first-time amateurs and they're all solid and believable.

Marston argues that the drug war won't be won by military and criminal systems; it's social and economic.  Other films like Traffic make the same point.  It's easy to feel helpless, realizing we're still spending billions to ""fight"" drugs and people like Maria are getting on planes every day.",1104105600,3,1773,4.9393939393939394
2119899,5,B0002TT0MS,"In this week's ""Entertainment Weekly"" Stephen King picked ""Maria Full of Grace"" as his favorite film of 2004, which is certainly an interesting thing to know before watching this independent film from writer-director Joshua Marston.  The picture on the DVD cover shows Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) posed as if she were about to receive Holy Communion.  Only instead of receiving the host Maria is about to swallow a pellet containing heroin wrapped in the finger of a latex glove.  That particular image is not present in the film with as much symbolism as it is on the cover, but it does represent the crucible of Maria's odyssey.

Maria is 17 and works in Colombia picking the thorns off of roses before they are shipped overseas.  Although she is clearly a bright girl, Maria discovers that she is pregnant.  To make things worse her boyfriend is a loser, her boss at work is a jerk, and her family needs her to provide money.  So after Maria quits her job she is introduced to a man in Bogot who will give her $5,000 for flying to New York City with 62 of those pellets in her stomach as a ""mule"" for a drug lord.  For Maria that amount is a virtual fortune and seems worth the risk that one of those pellets could break in her stomach and kill her.  So she practices swallow grapes so that she will be able to do what needs to be done to get her money.

There will be several mules on this particular flight, a practice known as ""shotgunning"" that Marston learned about and which inspired his original script.  The idea is that if you put several mules on the same plane and plan on U.S. Customs catching one of them, which would make it easier for the rest of the drugs to get through.  Also on the plane with Maria are her friend, Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega), who is jealous of the money her friend is going to make, a mule on her third run, Lucy (Giulied Lopez), who wants to visit her sister in New York City, and at least one more experience drug smuggler.

""Maria Full of Grace"" sets the stage for the big trip by paying attention to the process by which Maria first practices, and then swallows all those pellets.  This serves to underscore how dangerous this is going to be and you know that something is going to go horribly wrong.  It is just a question of how many of these girls will be dead by the time it is all over and what exactly Maria will do to earn the sobriquet of the title.  Marston does touch on all of the mules on the plane, but the focus of the story is on Moreno and her compelling performance.  Clearly Marston is out to make a point, but because this is a low-budget independent film he is forced to tell it simply.  Ironically, his leading actress is so good that we are concerned more with her survival than any stinging indictment of the use of mules by Colombian drug cartels.

Catalina Sandino Moreno won the best actress award a the 2004 Berlin Film Festival along with Charlize Theron in ""Monster,"" which is interesting simply because the performances are pretty much at opposite ends of the acting spectrum.  Since ""Maria Full of Grace"" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2004, where it won the Audience Award, Moreno's performance would be eligible for the next Academy Awards.  Usually Oscar nominations focus on movies released in December and as a rule ignore anything released before the Summer blockbuster season, but what Moreno did in this film might be too impressive to forget (Addendum: For once I was right and Moreno is nominated for Best Actress).",1103587200,169,3534,4.516483516483516

2119901,5,B0002TT0MS,"This movie is very good. The story is so interesting. Once you start watching the movie, you don't want to blink your eyes. You don't want to miss any word, any sentence. This is a story of a pretty, smart, desperate but determined Colombian young girl, Maria. The title of this movie descibes her the best - full of grace. Yes, she is so gracefull. Everything she does is gracefull, but life makes you do indecent things sometimes and Maria goes for it. She decides to get involved in ""muling"", trafficing illegal drugs from Colombia into United States carrying drugs in her stomach! You have to watch the movie to realize how horrible this profession is. You can not describe it in words.

And so, off she goes on this dangerous mission. I am not going to tell more about the plot because it won't be interesting for a reader to watch the movie if he/she knows the whole story. One thing I will tell, it is a very clever story. And what is very important, acting is superb. The role of Maria is played by very uknown actress, but she makes spectacular debut on the big screen.

At the end, I defenitely recommend to watch this movie. And I give two reasons for this: first, yo meet this amazing girl, Maria, who is portrayed in so much details; and second, you learn a lot about lifestyle in Columbia and why do people risk their lives and do such indecent things. 5 Stars!!!",1102982400,5,1377,4.438735177865612

The film centers around a 17-year-old Colombian girl who, with turns to become a drug trafficing ""mule"" for the money. The director, Joshua Marston, gives obvious foreshadowing clues throughout the entire film which make every scene seem ordinary. The story itself is remarkable, but a 20/20 special on the real story behind drug mules from Colombia would have been a time better spent. The film does make you realize your blessings, but also might cause you to credit your circumstances to your decision making, while blaming Maria's for her lack of. A better foreign film about the South American drug market would be the wonderful, ""City of God."" This film gives only brief glimpses of the tragedy that it is.",1102896000,3,809,4.955882352941177
2119903,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace is a surprisingly compelling foreign film this year or recent years. It's a very good low-budget film made by an American writer and director(Joshua Marston) which had taken him 5 years from writing the script to the finished film. The debut performance from the mesmerizing Catalina Sandino Moreno is trully captivating. She came across as a combination of Salma Hayek and LeeLee Sobieski. This film had won her the Berlin's best actress award, and I was really touched by her character as well as her performance.

Maria(Catalina) is an 18 year old living in poverty, and she works in a rose plantation in Columbia in order to bring home the bacon. She quit her job after an arguement with her boss, and her family was angry at her for losing the job. Meanwhile, she found out that she's pregnant and she has no desire to marry her ""stupid"" boyfriend. While she was looking for a new job, a friend of hers from the neighborhood introduced her to a drug dealer and told her that she can make lots of money working for him.

The job is to carry as many as 100 pellets of drugs in her stomach to New York city. It's a risky business, because if she gets caught, they might send her to jail. Also, if the pellets break in her stomach, she will die. Considered the big chunk of cash she wanted to earn, she took the job.

Along with several other girls on the flight who are also ""carriers"", Maria was very anxious whether she could make it all the way. She had to go to the toilet to ""eliminate"", and when some of the pellets came out, she had to wash them and swallow them down again. Her friend Lucy was in sweats, and had no idea that the pellet in her had been broken.

Maria was taken to the customs when she landed, because they suspected her and took an x-ray on her, and found out she was pregnant. She swore that she was not a ""carrier"", and they released her. One of the girls got caught, Maria, Lucy, and Blanca survived the customs.

They were picked up by the local dealers outside the airport and taken to a motel to ""eliminate"" the pellets. Lucy was already dying, and ultimately the dealers ended up cutting her open in order to get the pellets. Maria and Blanca were horrified and ran away with the pellets. They had no where to turn except Jucy's sister who had lived in NY for 4 years. There they had to figure out how to solve their trouble and tell the truth to Lucy's sister....

This is my favorite Spanish film since Talk To Her, and I think it's going to get a few Oscar nominations including best original screenplay and possibly best actress, considered that they had nominated the girl from Whale Rider.",1102464000,,2649,4.406952965235174

I will not write about the plot, because the other reviews have established what it is about. It is the best movie I have seen in awhile and everyone should see it. Makes me feel shameful for the stupid insecurities and insignificant worries I sometimes have. This girl had close to nothing and didn't let life stop her. See it.",1102464000,,595,4.219298245614035
2119905,5,B0002TT0MS,"MARIA FULL OF GRACE  is an unpretentious, low budget, superb little film that has managed to captivate the hearts of audiences everywhere. Writer/Director Joshua Marston has opted for extracting a slice of life in Colombia, found characters who symbolize the passions of young people who seek a  better life, and shows us how indomitable the human spirit can be.

Maria (portrayed by a gifted and beautiful young Catalina Sandino Moreno) lives among the poor in Colombia, earning a living for her mother and sister by stripping thorns off roses in a factory.  Unhappy with her work conditions and with her useless boyfriend who has impregnated her, she has the courage to quit her job and at the encouragement of a passing acquaintance  agrees to serve as a 'mule' to transport drugs form Colombia to the United States.

The film documents the means of transporting (swallowing many bags of drugs in a harrowing manner, riding an airplane with the fears associated with her  mission, arriving in America with all the terror of being in a strange place with a dangerous mission) in a way that feels so real that we as audience identify wholly with Maria.

The story is new, the acting is superb, and the many underlying messages are profound.  This is a film for every audience. An excellent film in Spanish with English subtitles.

2119906,5,B0002TT0MS,One of the best films I have seen in years. Sad and heartbreaking. Destined to become a classic like EL NORTE or similiar films. I highly reccomend.,1102377600,,148,4.518518518518518
2119907,5,B0002TT0MS,"I haven't been to a movie like this in a long time. It is simple, powerful story-telling. The film follows  a girl from a small Colombian town who becomes a drug mule, shows us what it is like to be a mule, and what happens to the girl when she gets to the United States. It has down-to-earth characters facing real life situations, and making difficult choices, sometimes bad ones. It doesn't have computer-generated graphics, car chases, glamour, and slick production.  It doesn't give the audience an easy formulaic plot and simplistic ending.  We see the complexity of the choices and how they affect the lives of the people who made them.

For me, the most powerful part of the film was how it showed the physical aspect of swallowing drugs.  It showed us how difficult it was to actually swallow the drugs, the dangers in  doing it, and what could happen if things went wrong. It made me realize how desperate the people who do this must be.",1099180800,2,947,4.57396449704142
2119908,5,B0002TT0MS,"For once, here's a small, low budget film done justice by its excellent marketing campaign.  First, my compliments to whoever designed the movie poster - to the uninitiated, it would appear that Catalina Sandrino Moreno's 'Maria' is about to receive Holy Communion - a perfect juxtaposition in devoutly Catholic Colombia.  Those who've seen the stark, no punches trailer know that Maria is receiving a baptism of a far different sort.

I often get frustrated when a powerful film like 'East Is East' is marketed here as a 'breezy charmer' (no lie - that was the campaign for a movie that was anything but).  So, I'm obligated to note when a movie and its marketing efforts respect the intelligence of its viewing audience.  Thank you, HBO Films.  And thanks, too, for taking a bet on writer/director Joshua Marston despite his brief biography.  Good to see that HBO continues to recognize that the best ideas don't always come out of the Hollywood enclave.

Ultimately, this movie works because of Catalina Sandrino Moreno's brilliant performance.  You have to believe her naivet, and for the ability of this 23-year-old to pull off a performance as a doe-eyed 17-year-old.  How/why could anyone become a mule, you ask?  'Maria' makes you see how a person could find themselves compelled to make such a choice.

'Maria' is also notable for its excellent depiction of the Colombian immigrants' support system in New York City, featuring a wonderful performances from Orlando Tobon as ""Don Fernando"" - a one-man office source of job leads, explainer of the U.S. legal system and all-around 'shoulder to lean on' for 'Colombians en el Exterior' in his neighborhood.  Given that Sr. Tobon is also Associate Producer, I suspect 'Don Fernando' is not too far from the role he plays in real life.",1096848000,8,1789,4.9630872483221475
2119909,5,B0002TT0MS,"""Maria Full of Grace"" is brutal, understated, unflinching cinema. It grabbed my attention without reaching for it; it held my attention without ostentation, without the need for building music, slow motion, computer effects or an obvious soundtrack.

It is a scary, jolting dose of a reality - or what could be reality - where a young Columbian girl, Maria, just 17 years old, quits her job cutting and arranging flowers after being treated unfairly by her boss. Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno) needs money to support her household, occupied by her mother, grandmother, sister and sister's baby, and she becomes desperate when she discovers she is pregnant.

A friend Maria meets at a party tells her about a difficult job she could do. He tells Maria she will need to transport tiny capsules of heroin - stored in her pregnant stomach - to New Jersey, a place, she is told, is just a ""small town outside of New York.""

Maria accepts the job, as do two other women she knows: one who is a friend, and one who is making a delivery to New Jersey for the third time.

First time writer/director Joshua Marston does not waste any time with meaningless, self-conscious, uneven scenes as many first-timers often do. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, I immediately liked Maria. I understood her character, her nuances, her worries, her hopes and her attitude. Moreno, as Maria, is a charming, comely and vulnerable teenager with whom I cared for and sympathized.

Since Maria's personality is well established in the first 30 minutes, and her choices stayed consistent and realistic throughout the movie, I believed each action she chose to take. I never shook my head or disagreed with any event in the plot; instead, I watched the unbearable tension unfold logically and skillfully.

I watched Maria standing in an airplane, sweating, nearly crying, trying to keep 60 heroin capsules in her stomach, thinking about her baby, worrying what could happen to her family if she threw up, worried that she could die if one tablet would break. I watched with unbreakable interest, completely invested in the characters and their gruesome situation.

""Maria Full of Grace"" is not just engaging in its laudable moments of tension, disaster and disappointment - it also allows us to glimpse an intriguing and surprising story of an abject woman in a country we know little about.

In many instances, the film creates a powerful glimpse of the dichotomy of North America and South America, of Hispanics living among Caucasians. It's a startling, depressing vision, and although the differences are shown upon the backdrop of a young, scared, confused woman delivering heroin pills, ""Maria Full of Grace"" is able to maintain a documentary-like feel, where we are being edified about the difficult, and in this case, illegal, struggles some Columbian people endure.

But the movie never begs us to feel educated and aware; that feeling comes through naturally in the subtle skills of the writing, acting and directing, all of which come together to deliver the best movie of the year: a movie that has an understated, powerful tone that takes the efforts of many current films reaching for profundity and completely destroys them.",1096588800,9,3216,4.973929236499069
2119910,5,B0002TT0MS,"To American audiences lulled by action flicks and insipid teen comedies, Joshua Marston's ""Maria Full of Grace"" is a bucket of cold water in the face. Shot in jittery, cinema-verite fashion, it tells the story of Maria Alvarez, a spirited young woman facing dead-end prospects in her small Colombian town, who takes the only apparent way out--signing on as a drug mule, swallowing packets of heroin and transporting them in her stomach from Bogota to New York. And thus, as Marston makes brutally plain, she leaps from the frying pan into the fire. Writer-drector Marston passes no judgment on Maria, though surely everyone who sees this film will feel renewed loathing for the drug trade. Maria is a headstrong but decent and moral young woman, whose only real crime is having been born into a world in which the deck is always stacked against her. As Maria, Catalina Sandino Moreno gives a beautiful, heartbreaking performance. Her final scene--in which Maria comes to a decision that leaves her well and truly alone--will haunt you for a long time. ""Maria Full of Grace"" may well be the best film ever made about illegal immigrants to the U.S.; in my opinion, it deserves comparison with ""Umberto D,"" ""The Bicycle Thief,"" and other classics of Neo-Realism.",1094342400,8,1259,4.943396226415095
2119911,5,B0002TT0MS,"This movie is pretty damn excellent... it's one of those movies that totally sucks you in. The main character, Maria, is sort of a flawed hero; that is to say, she makes some bad decisions. She isn't perfect. But then, she's living in a world full of bad options. She's pregnant and her boyfriend is kind of a loser who freely admits that he doesn't love her. She's living in a country full of crime and corruption but short on actual jobs. So, what's a girl to do? She needs money and there's one easy way to make money in Colombia....

In a way, this movie reminded me of ""Dirty, Pretty Things"" because both movies are about people who are forced to do criminal things in order to survive. Both movies are serious without being overwhelmingly bleak; while the circumstances of life may be pretty grim, the central characters manage to hold onto their integrity and - occasionally - a sense of hope. But whereas ""Dirty, Pretty Things"" wraps things up a bit too neatly in the end, ""Maria, Full of Grace"" manages to maintain a sense of reality throughout.

Bottom line, this is a great movie. Superb acting, suspenseful, occasionally tragic, occasionally hopeful.

Damn good stuff.",1093824000,,1180,4.690821256038648
2119912,5,B0002TT0MS,"'Maria Full of Grace' is one of those cinematic gems that is nearly perfect, made even more special thanks to a stunning acting debut that is exciting in its sense of refreshing hope.  The actress I am referring to is the incredible Catalina Sandino Moreno, who gives a nuanced performance as Maria Alvarez, a girl who is impregnated by her loser boyfriend, Juan (Wilson Guerrero), becomes fed up with her living situation, and decides to find opportunity in Bogota, her nation of Columbia's sprawling capital.  On the way, she meets a local man she had danced with the previous night at a club and he informs her of his connections with a group of people who pay women to travel.  ""Travel?"" she repeats.  To her, this sounds like the beginning of a glorious new horizon.  But she comes to find she is going to be a mule, a woman exploited by the drug business as a means of transporting drugs.  However, she does not seem to care.  America is hope.  Her job requires that she is sent there, so she complies with the drug lord's wishes and swallows one pellet-sized drug container after another in a sequence that is hard to watch because of its painful, emotional subtleties perfectly emphasized by all involved.

Throughout the film you feel more and more of these discreetly executed humanities pulsating from beneath the surface.  For instance, I have not been more affected by a plane ride than when Maria, her friend Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega), and two other mules (including an experienced, friendly mule Lucy, played with power by Guilied Lopez) are all scattered about a plane bound for America in pain from the sixty or so pellets stuck in their empty stomachs.  The three central woman share glances, and each actress manages to maintain raw sympathy despite what were obviously terrible and immoral career choices; we feel for their desire for a better life, of which America is a beacon of in their eyes.  Perhaps the only one of the three women we are not able to fully care for is Blanca.  Though it is obvious she became a mule in order to be with her best friend Maria, I do not feel Vega's performance was strong enough to convey every emotional aspect of her character.  She felt unrelentlessly annoying, in some moments.  My friend and I kept whispering, ""Stop ruining everything!  Shush!""  In a way Vega was simply one-note.  A pity, because she is the film's only true weakness.

The film's strongest aspect is by far Ms. Moreno.  Despite the fact that this is her very first movie, she appears flawless in her intensity and strength.  Her character, Maria, is someone who had to grow into a new, intimidating environment; she had to learn how to deal with emotions and situations that are not normal for her a seventeen-year-old.  Ms. Moreno makes you care deeply for Maria, and her transformation is an august, breathtaking one.

The writing is yet another plus in 'Maria Full of Grace.'  It maintained striking realism, and some of the more simple words were chilling in their power.  Consider when Juan and Maria decide whether or not they are going to have sex on top of a building's roof, high up from the ground.  Maria grows stubborn and starts to climb.  Juan is reluctant, and simply says, ""You're going to come down the same way you came up--alone.""  I was blown away by the depth in those words.  They were symbolic of some of the film's message, and they resonated strongly as I walked out of the theater.

As a whole, 'Maria' is one of the most poignant films all year.  It is swift in its execution, the ending is perfectly ambiguous, and the performances, apart from Vega's, are top-notch; it even manages to sneak in some important themes of honest grandeur, such as immigration.  Ultimately, it sets out to make us realize that when people buy drugs, they are supporting those who take advantage of the dreams of people who simply want to escape the imprisonment of a life they would give anything to escape from.  Lucy, the experienced mule, began trafficking drugs so she could travel to New York City and find her sister.  Each time she arrived to drop off her pellets, she would gain only the courage to arrive at her sister's door.  Not once in her two trips did she knock.  She couldn't tell the sister she loved and hadn't seen for four years why she had inexplicably appeared.  She was ashamed.  'Maria' makes it known that when people buy drugs, they don't support the exploitation alone, but also the progressive destruction of a person's humanity.  The concept becomes truly mind-blowing.",1093651200,8,4538,4.7034220532319395

Maria heads to Bogata, befriending a young man on a motorcycle.  She explains her plight to him and he takes her to someone who can help.  He is a mafia-type working upstairs in a bar.  He will pay her well to be a mulo (mule) which means that she will have to swallow a lot of cocaine packets and carry them to a contact point in New Jersey.

Maria, desperate goes along and is joined by a friend.  She soon finds that it is a much harder job than she thought because she can't swallow one of the packets, much less the 50 or so she is expected to swallow.

2119916,5,B0002TT0MS,"Maria Full of Grace is a moving and powerful motion picture about a girl who goes in over her head when she longs for a better life. We follow Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno) from her dead end job stripping roses in Colombia to a new opportunity--becoming a ""mule,"" by ingesting drugs in large capsules and smuggling them to  New Jersey. What follows is a gritty, fast-paced, and suspense-filled story

Remember the name Catalina Sandino Moreno. The heartfelt and harrowing performance she gives here has won her a heap of awards and I am sure there are many more to come. First-time director Joshua Marston, who also wrote the taut screenplay, shows Maria being taught how to swallow drugs wrapped in packets -- she sips soup to make them go down without gagging. If the drugs in her belly should seep out during Maria's turbulent jet flight to New York, she could be poisoned or arrested or both. Marston builds incredible tension. But it's the human drama etched on Moreno's young, weary face that gives Maria its potent punch.

This Winner of the Audience Award at Sundance is a terrific film; shocking, engrossing, and entertaining. But what makes Maria Full of Grace an extraordinary experience is its ability to be ordinary. We see everyday life here, plausible motives, convincing decisions, and characters who live at ground level. The movie's suspense is heightened by being generated entirely at the speed of life, and showing us what probably would happen, and not some implausible fairy-tale.",1092873600,96,1505,4.964285714285714

Director Joshua Marston has put together a well paced and riveting story concerning three young Colombian women who agree to smuggle drugs into the United States.  They do this by swallowing balloons filled with the illegal contraband.  And yes, it is dangerous and not exactly the best thing to do to one's digestive system.  Catalina Sandino Moreno is excellent as the poverty stricken and pregnant Maria who is unmarried and lacking any viable future prospects.  Carla (Patricia Rae) and Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega) are also in dire straits.  Things go tragically wrong and their lives will be changed forevermore.  New York City is a long way from their backward small towns.  The inevitable cultural shock is just the beginning of their troubles.  You will care about what happens to them.  My only complaint is that the title is somewhat misleading.  Religion plays virtually no role for any of the characters which doesn't quite ring true.
