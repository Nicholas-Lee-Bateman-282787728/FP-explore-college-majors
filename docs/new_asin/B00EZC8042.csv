5958497,5,B00EZC8042,"I have been waiting for this documentary since viewing the trailer months ago.  As the owner of China Wine Tours ([...] I am thrilled at this look at the wine business in China, which was unknown in the world even 5 years ago.  This film is beautifully shot, has excellent historical background, and explores the explosion of Chinese wine.  There are valuable insights into doing business in China also.

5958505,4,B00EZC8042,"Enjoyable documentary, but there is an audio issue approximately 2/3 into the run-time where audio output simply stops. This behavior occured on both a Roku player and a Playstation 4. To correct this issue, I had to configure the device I was using for playback - either the Roku or the Playstation - to output audio in Stereo and not any of the Dolby Digital variants.

If you do this and resume playback, audio should be fine. Just remember to set your device back to Dolby Digital audio output for playback of other content.",1459123200,2,528,4.617021276595745

Getting rather aggravated with these nouveau riche Chinese folks who think they are going to show up the world. Well, who would be proud to have ANYTHING that says MADE IN CHINA?? Complete embarrassment and they only have to purchase another countries goods to feel proud. Shameful.

Appreciating the whole USA California Napa wine growing region recognized in the 1970's as superior to French wines does not seem to impress our fellow hoarders. However, Appellation Chinoise receives the coveted designation and highest awards with Parker in tow with their vineyards, but who believes this was not bought and sold? If a stellar vintage occurs every 20 years but suddenly it happens overnight in China? OK folks let talk bridge sales.

I appreciated the delightful cinematography of the French wine regions and their respective histories. I am spoiled by having a touch of access to superb Napa wine selections and decided that craft beers are a more satisfying and affordable experience.

Hence, I recommend for French wine enthusiasts and the roller derby that China brings to the table. Russel Crowe is the definitive narrator.",1429833600,,1168,5.164021164021164

5958617,3,B00EZC8042,"Excellently made film, but the film seems to make a huge deal out of just doing business as I was taught to do in my MBA program, selling products at a high price to an inflated market.

Rich Chinese are buying the best wines purely as a status symbol, not because they are connoisseurs. They will move to purchasing alternative status symbols when wine grows common, dropping the price of French wines to previous prices.  Not a big deal as long as the French growers do not plan for the future based on the current inflated prices.

Threats to the French wine industry would seem to be 1) the sale of traditional vineyards to foreign interests 2) future competition for world markets from Chinese vineyards.

1)  Some businessmen will sell their vineyards to outside interests if the price is right.  Nothing the French can really do about it, except make this illegal to do.
2)  If similar stocks are used to produce wines in China, the land and climate are different:  wine is different from microclimate to microclimate.  Chinese wine will not be French wine.

According to the film the Chinese taste for wines is growing, so there is an emerging market for Chinese and French wines.  The average French person is going to get excellent wines at the corner market, so they are not hurt.  French wines have been there for 2000 years at least, so they probably are not going away soon.

For these reasons I could not be as enraged over the situation as the film seems to want me to be.",1415318400,,1488,4.569811320754717

5958621,5,B00EZC8042,"I found this documentary interesting because it shows the shift in the primary Bordeaux market from the US and Japan to China and the effect this shift has had on the prices and availability of said wines.

Most interesting of all is the interview where the woman actually says she doesn't care if her bottle is a fake or if it is any good - it is enough to know she wanted it and purchased it at the auction!

We see that with the decline in American interest for Bordeaux, the producers and importers have flocked to China to create a new market for this thirsty country.  Of course there is a lot of fraud, manipulation, and forgery - but this documentary doesn't delve too deeply into this facet.

It is short (75 minutes) and heavily focused on the subject - so it is of interest to what I would think is a very specific person.  Wine drinkers who have interest in the Bordeaux futures (whether buying Bordeaux or just interested in the process) or those who are in the industry would find more appeal from this documentary.  Still, it is interesting to see the new thirst for these wines - a thirst driven mainly by speculation and ownership than actual enjoyment and consumption of the wine!",1409270400,5,1198,4.497695852534562

The film presents facts and the views of people from both sites. Wine is and it will remain forever on obsession for some and a status symbol for others . I came away from this film with two things. First no need to cry about the prices. All other luxury goods are expensive, why not wine. Also remember there was a time when luxury was flowing from China to Europe in a form of porcelain, silk and spices .Those goods were only for the kings, whats deferent now is just the direction of flow. They are the kings now, they get to drink the legendary wines. For us simple people, for whom wine is an obsession, the news are great. The whole world is growing grapes and making wine. No matter were you go, you are bound to run into a good glass of wine. Obviously quality will rise sharply, it already is. We get to drink amazing wine at a reasonable price. Dare I say many times as good as the fabled stuff. So why complain. It's the wine that matters right, cause we are drinking not impressing ! Of course visually gorgeous film .

5958643,5,B00EZC8042,"Red Obsession is a succulent exposition of the cameo role Bordeaux wines have played in modern history. The grapevines of Bordeaux have been woven into global history since Romans introduced the vine to France in the first century. These wines, once enjoyed by Lafayette and Jefferson during the rise of democracy, have gained meteoric popularity in the current westernization of China. The film dives into a volatile period for Bordeaux wines as the industry is caught in a hegemonic shift to the East and the unprecedented rise of luxury consumerism in China. The film unearths a vivid story of wine but surprises with a rare characterization of Chinese influence and growth.

Also, brilliant research and archival acquisition by Christina Ross.",1383436800,16,747,5.225
5958644,4,B00EZC8042,"This is a good documentary of the Bordeaux region and the impact of China's new-found wealth has had on wine prices, but that's taking it at surface. The really interesting part is juxtaposing centuries of Bordeaux history on the current situation and realizing it's not really different than previous bubbles in Bordeaux wine. This film does a great job of exposing the current situation, but couching it in a historical light that serves to focus and contextualize the message. Honestly, some of the interview subjects were more candidate than I believe they intended, which is always the sign of a good documentary. You'll come away with perspective and, perhaps, just a little disdain. HIGHLY recommended!",1379721600,,709,5.173913043478261

5958646,4,B00EZC8042,"I just wrote a scathing review of ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" and so I needed to write a review of a film that I liked.  And this film would surely fit that bill, even though it's surely in a different genre.

I've been to Bordeaux myself.  As a matter of fact, the last time I was in France, my wife and I rented a car (with a very funky rolltop convertible) and drove to Reims, Burgundy, the Rhone region, and finally Bordeaux.  Naturally, it was for not only sightseeing, but it was for wine tasting as well.  And obviously, it was a very fun trip.  Doing a  private wine tour at Mouton Rothschild was perhaps the highlight of the trip.

While I would say that Bordeaux has some of the finest wines in the world, it also has some of the worst.  There are many wineries there, 1000s just around the St. Emilion area (a place that I highly recommend for not only its wine but its beauty) but there are some  wineries that put out Bordeaux that even unfit to cook with.  But Margaux, Mouton, etc. are fantastic, and it's amazing to do a little barrel tasting there.

So this movie was a must-see for me.  It was great seeing some of the sights there again, but I'm also a fan of Russell Crowe.  (Yes, I know some of his history, but when it comes to acting he's one of the finest.)  And this film is interesting in the sense that it attacks the wine business from a business perspective; that was a nice change.  I watched ""Somm"" awhile back, a film that I really liked, but most of that was purely subjective when it came to wine tasting and the pursuit of becoming a Sommelier.  Here, you might say truly that ""numbers never lie,"" and they most likely don't.  It is surely the case that the wine industry is being severely damaged due to the bottom line of it all; the business end of winemaking.

Pick up a good bottle of Bordeaux -- if any are left, since after all, China is starting to hoard quite a bit of the stock -- pour yourself a glass, and be prepared for a very interesting and enlightening film.  And to Mr. Crowe I say, ""Salud!""  And ""nice work.""",1378944000,2,2061,4.260309278350515
