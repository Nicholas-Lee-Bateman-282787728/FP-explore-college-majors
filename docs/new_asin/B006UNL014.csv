8504636,5,B006UNL014,"i bought this DVD straight from the monastery itself, The Hermitage of the Holy Cross. they still have copies available.

this dvd captures the monastery during the passage of a year, with beautifully shot scenery and informative discourse from the abbot. if you are interested in visiting an Orthodox monastery where the services are all in English, you can't go wrong here. highly recommended.",1357084800,5,395,5.171875
