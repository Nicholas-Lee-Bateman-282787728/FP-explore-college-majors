2533109,5,B000ERVKLM,"I saw this movie a long time ago and really enjoyed it. Then, when I saw it was finally available on DVD, I grabbed it. When Barbara Eden followed her son into the service because she couldn't cut the ties, it was hilarious watching her go through training and finally graduating. I would recommend this for anyone who is a true Barbara Eden fan.",1203811200,3,346,4.421875
2533110,5,B000ERVKLM,"""Your Mother Wears Combat Boots"" is the hilarious film about an over protective Mother (Eden) who runs her sons (Elizondo) life. After dropping her son off at college she learns he has joined the military. Following some crazy events she too ends up in the military as well, trying to get  him to drop out. This is wear it gets hilarious as she doesn't understand Military laws or rules. It is as if she is in her own little world. This makes for a very, very funny film. I highly recommend it to all. It is a must see film and a must own for your DVD collection!

I first saw this film on TV back in the early 90's when I stayed home sick from school. I have never seen it on TV since but I have never forgotten how funny it is. I now own it.",1170720000,6,743,4.013513513513513

2533112,5,B000ERVKLM,"I was there at Fort Benning, GA/ Main Post 14Feb90 when they filmed this TV-movie. I gave Barbara Eden a valentine and a box of candy. She was very polite as I sat and talked with her, her sister, and her co-star for some time. I also met Anson Williams. I think, the movie aired just 1 month later on TV. Very funny as Barbara Eden is and endearing. Her co-stars include some others seen often in many shows like Hector Alezondro. I want to buy an original copy of the movie when one becomes available.",1120867200,2,503,4.25

2533124,4,B000ERVKLM,"Decent recording and transfer to DVD (it has not been digitally remastered).  But it was a made-for-TV movie from the 1980s so you can't expect much.  Would not play on one of our DVD players, but worked fine on the newer player.",1414800000,,229,4.428571428571429

2533131,4,B000ERVKLM,"This is a cute movie. If you like good comedy that does not require fart jokes and slapstick. If you liked overrboard, Bird on the wire or stripes, you will like this movie",1288742400,,172,4.242424242424242
2533132,3,B000ERVKLM,"I enjoyed the film quite a bit.  Barbara and the cast are most enjoyable and she shows her comedic abilities to the max,  but the dvd production is somewhat lacking.  My copy has very long spaces which are the commercials from the TV production and its not very digitally remastered.  The disk won't let you advance to the next scene and has no other features of any kind other than the basic film.  I wondered whether it was a copy rather than a professional release.",1257724800,4,468,4.458823529411765

8113815,5,B000ERVKLM,"Brenda Andersen (Barbara Eden) is an overprotective single mother from Iowa, who does not want her 18-year-old son Jimmy (David Kaufman) to follow in the footsteps of her late husband (who died in a parachute accident in Vietnam) by becoming an Airborne paratrooper in the US Army. Instead she sends him off to college, and then moves to Alaska to take up a new job. But once she moves, Jimmy leaves college and enlists in the army. He initially keeps this a secret, and only tells her after he's completed basic training and is about to begin Airborne parachute training at Fort Benning, Georgia.

Brenda drives down to Georgia in an attempt to stop him, but when she arrives Jimmy has already entered Fort Benning. So she assumes the identity of an AWOL Airborne trainee named Susan Zimmel in order to enter the base and try to persuade Jimmy to leave. When Jimmy refuses to quit, she makes a deal with him  if she can make it through the Airborne training course herself, then he will not do the parachute jump at the end of the course, and will leave the army and return to college.

Brenda struggles to adjust to the strict military regimen and make it through the tough and physically demanding Airborne training course. Her fear of heights also causes her difficulties. This leads to a number of comic incidents, though her drill instructor, Sgt. Burke (Hctor Elizondo), fails to see the funny side. But with a little help from other trainees in her squad, Brenda perseveres, determined to get Jimmy to leave the army.

In the end, however, the experience leads Brenda to realize that Jimmy needs to complete the training in order to develop a closer bond with his late father, and gives him her blessing to complete the final qualifying parachute jump. She then conquers her fear of heights and also makes the jump herself.

This movie is hard to find, but is available on DVD.",1473206400,3,1885,4.6656626506024095

8113818,3,B000ERVKLM,"Who better to see in combat boots than Barbara Eden?

She plays an over controlling mother that lost her husband as Airborne in Vietnam. She finds that her child has turned down college to go Airborne.
Going to any length in this comical farce, she assumes the identity of Private Zimmerman to cajole her son not to make the same mistake.

In the process she learns a bit about military life and the difference between BVDs and BDUs  a crucial skill.
Will she succeed?

We as the viewers of this 1989 American made-for-television comedy film may learn something in the process.",1451692800,,577,4.683168316831683
