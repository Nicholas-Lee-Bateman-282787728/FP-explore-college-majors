2069041,5,B00028G6MQ,"i requested this dvd from my grandmah and she got it for me. it was great, we both enjoyed it very much . it was funny,  pablo is very talented and funny. he rocks. i saw more shows of him and im a big fan. he rules.",1119744000,,216,3.595744680851064
2069042,5,B00028G6MQ,Pablo is probably one of the funniest stand-up comedians I have ever seen!!  He makes everything 10 times funnier with all of his voices,1116720000,,136,4.666666666666667
2069043,5,B00028G6MQ,"If you would like to see Pablo Francisco live with new material, he is touring and can be seen at local universities and comedy clubs. Mostly new material, but some old stuff with other stuff added on to it. I saw him live and laughed for a straight hour. Great comedian, not so much for the kids, but the funniest comedian I have ever seen.",1114905600,3,341,4.2615384615384615
2069044,5,B00028G6MQ,Pablo Francisco is funny as hell. Pure and simple. He's got way different material than most comedians today and he uses sound effects he produces himself to make things funny. He has your typical comedian jokes about porn. But then he'll begin to talk about the music they play in porn. And his impressions are great too. Like of the guy who narrates the movie commercials is just brilliant and then doing an impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger selling tacos on TV. Stuff like that. This guy is a step behind George Carlin in my oppinion. Absolutely hilarious. A++++,1111622400,10,567,4.795918367346939
2069045,3,B00028G6MQ,"Pablo definitely knows his stuff, and the material here is fairly funny for the most part. Be warned though, he uses a TON of profanity in here. Seeing him on TV, I thought he was relatively clean. That's not the case. Most of his jokes rely on profanity for the punchline. To see a much better job done with a lot less language, get anything by Brian Regan.",1109635200,16,358,4.279411764705882
2069046,5,B00028G6MQ,"I had heard of Pablo Francisco, years back he even toured smaller comedy clubs, and I had wanted to check him out... but never got the chance. Enter this DVD. What was an impulse buy at (forgive me, I attend college in a small town that doesn't even have a Best Buy) Wal-Mart, has instantly become one of my favorites discs. This guy does stand-up in a truly unique way, at no point in his act does he ever appear to be having anything but a good time. I can appreciate anyone who loves their job that much! Plus the guy's freakin' hilarious. Buy this DVD! Don't forget to pack a change of underwear. ;)",1109376000,3,603,4.252173913043478
2069047,5,B00028G6MQ,"this dude is loco

he makes cool sound effects with his mouth

this is very original cutting edge material

and a rare style of comedy

damn i laughed alot this dude is so damn funny

this latin comic is right up there with the best like Paul Rodriguez and George Lopez

Your gonna want more when the shows over

WE NEED MORE PABLO ON DVD!

this DVD is a little short but its worth it

and it has good replay value cuz u can watch it over and over again.",1107388800,,454,3.9555555555555557
2069048,5,B00028G6MQ,"This is what got me in to stand-up comedy. This special is just as good when I watch it today as 5 years ago. Great stories, insane punch-lines and a finish that leaves you gasping for air. Remember to watch Pablo's commentary of the show, it's almost better than the main event. He does sound-effects to his own show-hilarious!",1100304000,5,328,4.576271186440678
2069049,5,B00028G6MQ,"If you haven't seen this, it is definitely worth picking up.  A lot of Pablo's stuff has made the rounds on Comedy Central, etc., but this is a much more uncensored Pablo -- in fact, he is at his best when he is riffing on the audience impromptu.  His ""canned"" stuff (Arnold impressions, etc.) is still funny, but his crude humor is SO much better.  We've had this on in the background at parties and usually everyone stops what they're doing and starts congregating around the TV within a few minutes.  And then you and your friends will be quoting the lines for years to come -- literally.  I have friends who still trade quotes with me six years after we watched this DVD.  It will become part of your inner hilarious brain mix tape.",1371859200,,736,4.4148148148148145
2069050,5,B00028G6MQ,This video is hilarious! I've bought it a few times and given it as gifts. You cannot go wrong with Pablo!,1349654400,,106,4.095238095238095
2069051,5,B00028G6MQ,This DVD is a must! My husband loves it and I ordered it last minute and it still came on time,1327017600,,94,3.5238095238095237
2069052,5,B00028G6MQ,"This is really a stand-up comedy masterpiece!
With his incredible sound effects and quick-thinking, if your laughter lasts more than a few seconds, you might loose two or three jokes in a row...",1323129600,,194,4.909090909090909
2069053,5,B00028G6MQ,"I wouldn't have the friends I have today if I never played this video to all of them. I finally got to meet him and he knows who I am since we have been tweeting each other for a while. He handed 2 DVD's to my boyfriend and I and signed both of them for us.

If you want to have a great party, this is the perfect thing for you to play when starting it off, have a drink, kick back and watch the spillage!!!",1319500800,,407,3.7325581395348837
2069054,5,B00028G6MQ,"By far, my favorite Pablo standup on video. I've never had the privilege of seeing him live, but this is as close as I will probably come. If you've seen or heard is material before, you will most likely recognize some of this. At the same time, you might recognize some of it, but he has perfected his performance and this is the best I think he will ever do.",1229731200,,360,4.1571428571428575
2069055,5,B00028G6MQ,"If your sides aren't splitting after the first eight minutes, you're probably not much into comedy at all.  Pablo is absolutely outstanding in this release.  From his ""movie guy"" trailer piece to his R2D2 impersonation to his mariachi band imitation, Pablo is truly a comedic star.  This isn't the best dvd for children of course, but for the adult viewer who enjoys a good stand up comedy and isn't offended by a few swear words, this is a must have.",1214870400,4,451,4.6125
2069056,5,B00028G6MQ,"Well there is not much I can say about the DVD. Since I ordered it for a friend in the marin core. So when he gets to port and is able to conntact me I can tell you the caulity of the DVD. But you did get me the DVD in a timely manner. Thank you

2069057,5,B00028G6MQ,"Pablo Francisco is simply refreshing.  His comedy act is unique and hilarious.  His impressions are clever, and I love his Psycho Boyfriend/Girlfriend routines.  Absolutely hilarious!!!  I play this cd on road trips and the car is non-stop laughter.",1209859200,,249,5.473684210526316
2069058,4,B00028G6MQ,"Enjoyed this a lot, very funny. Not as good as his 'Ouch' DVD in my opinion, but still definatley worth checking out.",1201132800,,117,4.363636363636363
2069059,5,B00028G6MQ,I love this DVD. I watch it over and over again! Pablo Francisco is hillarious!!!,1199664000,,81,4.466666666666667
2069060,5,B00028G6MQ,"Pablo is so funny that after watching his video several times we still laugh our heads off. This performance is packed with great material. Even though he looks like a *%#@ing monkey, we love him.",1185148800,,196,4.628571428571429
2069061,5,B00028G6MQ,"His comedy is right on, I first saw him on the Comedy channel and then on You Tube.  I found myself playing his bits over and over for family and friends.  Finally I decided I had to see his whole show, you will not be diappointed.",1178928000,,231,4.0
2069062,4,B00028G6MQ,"despite his rude sexual humor, Pablo is definetly one of the funniest guys in stand up comedy. His sound effects are legendary and his face expressions are hilarious! Great DVD, you will have fun listening to it.

Although Pablo isn't 100% funny throughout the whole show, he get's pretty much all of your attention anyways.

4 out of 5 stars, cuz I'm sure he can be even funnier! Other than that, great DVD!!!",1161216000,,410,4.602739726027397
2069063,5,B00028G6MQ,Greate standup. For the price is just excelent you get a dvd and a cd. Pablo is hilarious and his impretions are probably the best thing on the dvd. If you don't like comedians that use a lot of profanity then probably this isn't for you. Great Buy.,1142035200,4,249,4.208333333333333
2069064,5,B00028G6MQ,"All I got to say is this guy is hilarious! His ability to imitate people, music, and other sounds is what really makes him funny in my opinion. If you like laughing, then buy this dvd.",1141344000,4,184,4.138888888888889
2069065,2,B00028G6MQ,I love Pablo's act on Comedy Central.  This one doesn't even touch it.,1141084800,3,70,4.384615384615385
2069066,5,B00028G6MQ,"My friends and myself included have been quoting material on this CD for months!  I am actually ordering another copy because a friend of mine wants to keep the first copy I bought.

The humor is top notch, with some fantastic anecdotes and characters that stick in your memory.  The impressions are among the finest I have ever heard and are quite possibly exemplify the most talented array of impressions offered by a single individual on the planet.  He cleverly integrates at least half a dozen characters, each with his/her own fire.

Pablo Francisco is not only funny, but exquisitely talented in all of content, delivery, and recurring story lines interlaced within the routine.  His mannerisms help to fully paint the picture of each situation and are a fantastic complement to the spoken words.  He gives off an air of an individual who is kind and enthusiastic... an interesting duo in a comedian I know, but you will understand what I mean when you watch.  He's very likeable in that you won't feel offended or annoyed by his humor and it's predictability which seems to be a flaw common in latin/caucasian crossover humor.

In short, Pablo Francisco is unlike anything you have ever seen.  Your mouth will gape open with amazement within the times that laughter does not overcome you.  It is beginning to end, a continually rising routine that ends in a grand finale the likes of a downtown fireworks show.  You'll be glad you spent the money... hell, I'm buying the DVD for the second time!",1139443200,3,1503,4.782945736434108
2069067,4,B00028G6MQ,"I laughed through the whole thing! This is a little more racy than his TV aired standup act. A little more profanity than I expected but funny nonetheless. His voices and expressions make the act. Subtle or blatant the comic material is humorous and edgy. With his voices and expressions he draws you into each little ""scenario"". Bravo Pablo!",1129248000,,342,4.813559322033898
2069068,5,B00028G6MQ,If you don't know pablo then you are missing out on one of the rising comedians of today. I saw him live at the local improv and after that I absolutely had to buy his DVD. He puts on a good show. I laughed so hard when I first saw this I was sore the next day. Highly recommended.,1125878400,,281,3.7796610169491527
8024005,5,B00028G6MQ,"Hysterical! He's one of my favorite comedians! Received DVD in a timely manner and packaging was perfect, not a scratch. Keep in mind he's an R-rated comedian so I wouldn't recommend for children or people who don't like vulgarity or are offended easily. FYI: cursing, a few crude sexual jokes, lightly jokes about racial stereotypes. Other than that, he's got a great stage presence, funny facial/body mannerisms, makes himself laugh, great sound effects & voices....everyone I've shown this to has cracked up and loved it! Would recommend to fans of Jim Carrey,Kevin Hart, Katt Williams, and Gabriel Iglesias.",1518998400,,611,5.244897959183674

8024010,5,B00028G6MQ,Pablo is hilarious! Bits and pieces of his standup routines...brilliant imitations of people. Stand ups usually center their material around something they are good at......Pablo tells a story with all the voices and then hits you with something really absurd but funny.....you will love Pablo......,1429315200,,299,5.666666666666667
