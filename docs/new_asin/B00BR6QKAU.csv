8613780,5,B00BR6QKAU,"Used as a 'complimentary' centerpiece for a pharmaceutical / biotech course I developed about the New England Compounding Center case.  (Course name - NECC Meltdown: Dollars, Deception, and Death.)  Top attendee rated GMP program during our 2013 GMP Training Marathon.  NOTE: I trust the legislative branch of the United States enacts meaningful legislation to stop this kind of tragedy from ever happening in the future.  Great job by Scott Pelley of CBS News.
