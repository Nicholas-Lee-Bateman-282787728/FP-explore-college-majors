7854587,5,6303544770,"When I was little I was a HUGE fanatic of the series (okay I still am, but that's not the point here) These two episodes showcase some of the best dramatic (and we are talking serious acting) from Williams and Dawber.
In the first one, Mindy discovers she has a major case of represed grief  after learning her father is remarrying. Mindy's nightmare flash back  scared the living daylights out of me when I was little, and it is still  very sobering.
The second episode is more typical except at the end when  Mork, lamenting celebrity, rattles off a list of famous people who died too  young. Although Williams is a master actor, you can tell he slips out of  character for a moment when he ads John Lennon with a crack in his voice.  Imediately followed by silence (as opposed to the usual gag-signing off, it  too is very sobering. Even those too young to remember John Lennon will  know the signifigance of the change in plot.",962668800,11,931,4.494047619047619
