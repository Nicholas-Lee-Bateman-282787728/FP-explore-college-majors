7982613,5,B00008G7PH,"Very good intro to jazz-blues comping.  Don Mock is an excellent video instructor with clear, well paced lessons.  He's got a great cool-jazz guy attitude that inspires confidence and is fun to watch. There is a lot packed in a short time, so rewinding is a must.",1487894400,,263,4.574468085106383

7982615,4,B00008G7PH,"This is a pretty good DVD but its somewhat lopsided.  The first 40% or so of it discusses suggested voicings for the chords.  I think this is very important information for someone who doesn't know that.  But perhaps it could have been in a ""Vol 1"" DVD.  I took a course twice to get these chords under my fingers and appreciate how important it is to have these.  This would influence the title to something like ""Jazz Guitar Voicings and what to do with them"".  The DVD goes into working out a more complex 12 bar blues form with more chord changes and how to use what you now know.  There is a super brief section on minor forms but its mere minutes.  If you're not bringing anything to the table you'll be lost.  There is also a odd ""Special"" section with 1998 graphics to describe the knobs on a typical amp.  Yup, What is Gain?  Volume?  There is one chapter in the special that goes over more chord forms by someone other than Mock.  I thought that was nice of them to squeeze a bit more for students.  I would say this DVD needs the viewer to have at least 18 months of guitar work or more, a willingness to go for fresh chord shapes, and an understanding that mastering the contents of this DVD could take six months if you're more on the beginner side of things.  I know when I first saw it a few years ago I put it on the shelf and only revisited it a few years later and said ""Oh I get it!""",1455494400,3,1402,4.140740740740741

7982617,5,B00008G7PH,"Don Mock at his very best - loved this - wish it had been longer. Very clear instruction - the booklet is all  tab, making it very accessible. My only criticism is that the section on minor blues is rushed at the end - this deserves a DVD of it's own. Superb - really gets to grips with blues comping.

There is an updated version of the booklet available as a pdf from Don Mocks blog - [...]
The booklet includes both standard notation and tab, and has a more convenient format - no page turning required.",1356307200,8,506,4.206185567010309
7982618,5,B00008G7PH,"This is one of the most informative DVD's about jazz blues and comping in the market. Don Mock is one of the best educators alive (he is a legendary founder instructor of GIT institute).You will love this DVD: He gives lots of info about jazz blues progressions, chord voicings -extensions and alterations- rhythm, comping, walking bass, etc, with authority (he knows this stuff quite well) but in a clear and friendly way. I learned a lot from this one. A+ !!!!",1351296000,7,462,4.716049382716049
