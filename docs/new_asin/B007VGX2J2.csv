5111467,5,B007VGX2J2,I just loved this movie from beginning to end. I work with these types of young ladies and used this film to somewhat encourage them to be the best them they could be. That being locked down and locked away doesn't mean life is over but to choose a better life for yourself. I give this movie 10+,1348876800,2,296,4.120689655172414

5111470,4,B007VGX2J2,I was hoping for something that might work for a meeting with my youth group.  It was way more then I could have hoped for.  It has a great and encouraging message for the youth in a time when they are under so much pressure. A very good story shown realisticly offering hope.  Thank you,1341446400,,287,4.181818181818182

5111473,5,B007VGX2J2,"This movie opens with a couple of young people running to escape from the police after committing a robbery. When the escape doesn't go as planned the story follows the experiences of the 17-year-old girl involved as she is incarcerated. She enters the corrections facility very angry and withdrawn. She faces the choice of joining forces with one of two very contrasting women who reach out to her for very different reasons. She is torn between the gang leader who will smuggle letters for her to and from her boyfriend, but expect things in return, or the captain of ""Crew 9""--a group of prisoners who have earned the right to go out of the facility and fight fires. The captain is an intelligent young woman who made a serious mistake 3 years before and is paying dearly for it. We observe these young women as they decide what they want out of life and how they must take responsibility for their actions. They are encouraged and gently guided by a caring counselor, who truly believes in them. This isn't a sugar-coated story. There is anger, bullying, hate, shame, disappointment, death, and tension. Somehow it is all portrayed without straying from family-appropriate language. Along with all of the things portrayed from the harder side of life, we also see courage, hope, loyalty, caring, forgiveness and renewal. You see the despair lift as these young women begin to believe in themselves and become accountable for what they make out of their own lives.
Another quality offering from the Hallmark Hall of Fame people. Due to the intensity of some scenes, I would not recommend it for young children, but it would be great viewing for families with teens.",1337904000,10,1668,4.835664335664336
5111474,5,B007VGX2J2,"This movie showed the love & interest these women needed,other then family, meaning the ""youth counselor"". These women committed crimes, and were sent away for them. But they had someone to care about them ""firm"", but not judgemental. They had someone to trust & to listen to them. For some people ,when you have that you have alot.  This movie gave alot of those women hope. For the young lady at the end who returned to prison. I believed it showed the other women. That they need to have more determination to be motivated, from within not to return to prison. I believe this movie would be a good learning tool for young people to watch. And for the bad girls? They still can be reached just give them time & patience.",1337558400,,722,4.46969696969697
5111475,4,B007VGX2J2,"Early this year, Hallmark Hall of Fame productions made a drastic change. It moved from its long-time ""permanent"" home on CBS to ABC. The move took fans by surprise as we immediately wondered if this wonderful series was coming to an end after over two-hundred films. Once surprise wore off, it was more a question of why CBS ended it since it the films were always well received. Now it has moved to another network, I've watched the last few with some disappointment. This one was, likewise viewed with trepidation.

There isn't much you can do when a young person decides to throw away their life - even if it is a life riddled with broken hearts. As a counselor at a correctional facility, D.J. (Cuba Gooding Jr.) doesn't have an easy job. Every day, he sees broken young people whose lives are not only ruined by the choices they've made but are suffering broken souls from neglect, or terrible childhood or domestic abuse. The facility houses only women and D.J. sees - despite the attitudes and pasts, these women are better than what they think in their capacity as convicts. Instead of merely counseling them to betterment, D.J. comes up with a program that will show the girls they can do good works - to help them feel a sense of belonging and hope in heroic acts they train for. Then he meets Caroline (Q'orianka Kilcher).

Only seventeen, she is embittered and angry over being betrayed by a boyfriend she thought loved her - and yet still, she forgives him. Caroline seems like the one girl D.J. has to work extra hard at reaching. Her past has made her hard to the world and any relationships that may result from interacting with others but D.J. sees something in Caroline that her fellow inmates who seem only interested in taunting her do not. Determined to reach her, he encourages Caroline to join Crew 9; a team that not only fights forest fires but also saves civilian lives - offering each of these women a chance at redemption in the process. Crew leader, Terri (DeWanda Wise) has a past that every day she re-lives - a single moment she would give almost anything to change. Feeling as if Caroline could use a friend, through D.J. and Terri's help, she may be able to ""buy herself back,"" learning to live again.

In case I haven't told you all, generally speaking, I love the productions that Hallmark Hall of Fame brings to our television screens. This one was probably one of the most heavily promoted that I'd ever seen. Its TV spot aired at least three times in a programming spot of two hours and used Kelly Clarkson's ""Stronger"" as its go-to song on the trailer. In the lyrics, ""What doesn't kill [you] makes [you] stronger..."" the movie's purpose is captured. To my surprise, Firelight is a memorable piece of film work. Directed by a familiar name to Hallmark as well as scripted by a screen writer who is no stranger to Hallmark, the movie also has a small host of well-known celebrities behind-the-scenes, and was produced by Brent Shields (Beyond the Blackboard, Loving Leah, The Russell Girl, and countless others) - yet another familiar name who is no stranger to television productions.

Primarily, the movie feels like it is Caroline's story. It opens telling us why she is sent to the facility but as the film progresses, we know little of her history - why she made the decisions she did. We make an educated guess that she was abused and hear she is a ""runaway,"" leading to the assumption that she is either in foster care or has a parent still living but they don't care about her one way or another. These two hours are most kind to Terri in terms of a back-story. We learn the pain of her past and can ""feel"" it through the screen - we understand why she is a broken soul who has still managed to ""move on"" in spite of the mistake that cost her not just her once happy, carefree life but also the eventual loss of her mother whom she cannot ""help.""

Anyone who is familiar with Kilcher's name or work will know what kind of actress she is. Her face usually remains expressionless and is often... almost angry. This role is no different, first appearing on the scene in the Pocahontas story, The New World (I'd seriously council those who may not have seen that movie to never bother with it - sorry, fans, but it was just... painfully bad). This role is no different. Her anger and sorrow is evident in nearly every frame she is in, rarely does she even crack a smile but then, that is perfectly suited to her character here. Each and every one of the ladies in this film were phenomenal - Wise plays Terri with the right amount of raw emotion and heartbreak while also being a girl who is going through a very painstaking healing process. Then there is Cuba Gooding Jr. He is equally marvelous in his role - as usual, the cast make the movie what it is. There are a lot of emotions in this movie. Sorrow that a girl repeats her mistakes and cannot make good on her second chance. Disappointment that another refuses her father. Heartbreak when we realize the extent of the reasons behind some of the girls winding up where they did. Poignancy is a part of the script in many ways, and despite a typically Hallmark ending that is ambiguous (I can think of one ending I'd have really liked), the movie is a solid piece of filming. There are tears, yes, but it is a tale of redemption that ultimately will triumph over temptations. That is what leads to a smile.",1335225600,9,5406,4.523517382413088
5111476,5,B007VGX2J2,"Firelight with Cuba Gooding, Jr. was a great movie and I would highly recommend it.  It was very interesting, well done, and really inspiring.  I saw it last night on the Hallmark Channel and I plan to buy a copy for a friend.",1335139200,,226,4.232558139534884

5111511,5,B007VGX2J2,"In my opinion, this is a more realistic viewpoint of what happens to incarcerated youth.  Not all are as fortunate to have as  understanding and compassionate a counselor/mentor as the one portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr.; once again he nails the personality and traits of the character he plays in this movie to a 'T'.  It seems no matter what part this great actor takes on, he is able to crawl inside their mind and body and become the person he portrays.  By the same token, he doesn't allow his character to overpower the other characters in the movie, making for a great viewing experience.  This is a wonderful movie that should make all young teens consider their paths and choices for their lives.",1413763200,5,703,4.637096774193548

5111516,5,B007VGX2J2,"This is a fact based story about a  caring counsellor at a girls facility .  The name of the movie comes from the fact that as a means of helping the girls with self-esteem issues has a set-up with the local fire department where those, trustworthy enough to be allowed to do so,  are able to go out and help fight fires!  It's a great movie and Cuba Gooding Jr. does the magnificent acting performance he always does!",1399680000,4,418,4.32051282051282

5111531,5,B007VGX2J2,"I was totally floored watching this movie. I didn't know what to expect when I was watching it at first, then Caroline came and made me mad; but I keep watching. By the end of the movie I was almost in tears when Terry left to go home. To nothing or no one. A very inspiring and moving film. I want to get a copy to show at my church for the teenagers to watch so they don't get themselves into he same perdicament. Or own up to there choses. A movie that every mother should show their teenagers that your actions have consequences.",1373328000,2,533,4.134615384615385

8522213,5,B007VGX2J2,"After viewing this movie! I would have to say this is one of the best movies that I have watched in years. This movie has class and dignity without all the foul language and nudity. Although the setting of the movie is in a detention center it appears that someone of them act derogatory towards each other. However, I would like to see our tax money to go to more programs like this one to help trouble young people. The part of the movie that really stuck with me was despite whatever happens to you in life..its not over and until God says its over.
