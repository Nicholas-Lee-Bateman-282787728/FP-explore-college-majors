8758146,5,B01E9M2B9M,"An atmosphere of cold fear moves across the border of East Berlin as a mother and her child flee to West Germany in search of freedom: The present day film is set in 1978. ( -The film though, will open to a fleeting and touching reference to a happier scene with husband, wife and child -3 years earlier. ) In 1978, the process of Western citizenship will take 12 days of rubber stamping of authorisation as the mother and her child are interned into a community camp for refuges. From the unrestricted freedom of the Western camp, the mother attends interviews with the American immigration officers, while her child attends the community school. Two Immigration officers quiz the mother to establish why she chose to escape from East Germany  but all is not clear in her reasoning as we learn to discover that her husband died in an uncertain  death?

This is a beautiful film that draws interest of storytelling in episodes  one with an Immigration officer; another with a fellow interned refuge; and then of course - with her child, and then again with the daily life of the community camp - until her application has been completed.

A beautiful film indeed, along with lovely warm and cold tones of colour that alternatively reflect moments of liberation, and one of fear: Paranoia will underline the tone of the film. The filming itself is remarkable and fresh; subtle, but in sharpness, sometimes in angled shots of street level in the autumn season: I love this film in its attention to cinematic detail  the bright and low lighting  the tones of the colours  it is a great artistic achievement by film director, Christian Schwochow. The acting is unstilted and natural to an uneasy atmosphere of apprehension. It is as though freedom itself cannot be defined between the East and the West (- the West which seems to mirror the Soviet East?) Again, an absorbing film with highly charged outbreaks of emotion from repressive souls: Only the mother will understand how to seek liberation in the true freedom of happiness?

An outstanding film which I highly recommend and enjoyed the film later reminded me of a classic film entitled,  Fear Eats The Soul. The film ends with a very upbeat jazz score by Marion Black entitled,  Who Knows?
