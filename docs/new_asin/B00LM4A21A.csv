6490679,5,B00LM4A21A,"I have a feeling that of all the monster movie ""types"", werewolf has to be the most difficult to film, even harder than Godzilla-type towering monster epics. But Wer basically takes all the difficult-to-swallow clichs of the werewolf mythos and brings them very much into a believable world filled with great legal drama, SWAT-style attacks, some really gruesome mutilation scenes and a pretty incredible actor (Brian Scott O'Connor) as the beast. Really class act.",1407888000,2,465,5.297297297297297
6490680,4,B00LM4A21A,"Original story line full of scenes that had me holding my breath until......
Wonderfully acted by a capable group of convincing characters, some recognizable and some newcomers you'll surely remember.
Subtle twists in the story that kept me guessing, had me questioning and in the end left me thinking - I didn't see that one coming.

If you're not a fan of subtitles, don't let that discourage you from going for this one.  It's minimal subtitles from the police chief as we are in France which adds to the whole experience with it's breath-taking landscape and darkened atmosphere.  The majority of actors are american which was a pleasant surprise.  A solid 4 1/2 stars from me on this one and a recommendation to all who enjoy horror with a thrill and ample gore, WER will not disappoint - go for it!",1407888000,2,804,4.680851063829787
6490681,4,B00LM4A21A,"Was a bit skeptical at first....But have been an A.J. Cook fan for awhile and know for a fact she is a very good actress.
This movie has a nice twist to the werewolf genre...solid acting all around.  Writing is pretty good but the ending kind of leaves you
hanging...Overall, I enjoyed the movie and will probably watch it again in a few months time.",1407888000,,350,4.384615384615385
6490682,1,B00LM4A21A,"Or it could have been done with an phone-cam.

It's shot on the cheapest of cheap budgets, stars no one of any note or with the slightest talent.  Lighting is non-existent except for ambient, available light.  Ad-lib dialogue, not moving the plot along.

Annoying ""jump scares"" instead of real scares, meat carcasses as victims (totally unbelievable and fake looking).

I can't believe they want $15.00 to see this college project.",1407801600,,431,5.1
6490683,5,B00LM4A21A,Now this was a good movie to add to my collection. The visuals were great and the werewolf was very realistic and scary. Movie was fast pace and believable. I love how the werewolf went from standing upright to running on all fours like a wolf. Movie had a good plot and I wish there was a WER II. Interesting concept with the werewolf transformation.,1407715200,,351,4.415384615384616
6490684,3,B00LM4A21A,"Not a bad little creature feature!  I wish the characters had been a little more developed but as far as wolf man stories go, this was a fairly fresh take on the genre.  The last decade has offered us horror lovers with an endless re-imagning of vampires, zombies and ghost stories of all flavors, but the wolf man has been sadly overlooked.  With a slightly better script and a few more bucks thrown at it, this might have been an instant cult classic.  However, it was a bit predictable and the jump scares wore out their effectiveness over time.  Still, I give this flick an A for effort, it's well worth the rental for a lazy evening.",1407715200,5,638,4.418803418803419
6490685,5,B00LM4A21A,Best one I've seen in quite sometime.,1407715200,,37,4.428571428571429
6490686,4,B00LM4A21A,"I honestly wasn't sure about how this movie was going to turn out due to the fact that I'm not much of a ""werewolf"" fan.  I was for some reason, under the impression this was a ""found footage"" movie.  I guess I saw some of the trailers and just got that impression.  It's not.  Well, there ARE parts that are of the ""found footage"" type, but they are simply security footage and things of that nature.  I'm going to be honest here, I'd have watched this movie if it were about pretty much anything because I love A.J. Cook.  Ever since seeing her in Out Cold, I've liked her.  Aside from that, this movie is actually quite good.

Cook plays Defense attorney, Kate Moore.  She has recently taken on a case involving the murder of a vacationing family.  After spending some time and learning more about her client and his family, she quickly realizes that things aren't quite as they appear.  Unfortunately, by then it's a bit too late.  I really don't want to give anything away but the first half is speculation, the second half is entertainment!

Final Verdict:  Watch it!",1406851200,64,1073,4.520833333333333
6490687,5,B00LM4A21A,"A fresh take with a new twist to legendary tale.
A new spin on an old story.
This film concentrates more on a modern approach to the D.N.A. which causes a medical condition,
which in time ,turns out to be the werewolf gene / condition.
Uncovered by a legal team trying to get their client off of murder charges.
I liked the idea of the medical condition added with the full moon you get a beast not a man nor a wolf.
If you are into werewolf movies ,...I strongly recommend this one to be added to your collection !
I really enjoyed it,edge of your seat fun !
Cast was great and film production was top notch !",1406851200,14,610,4.1344537815126055

6490690,4,B00LM4A21A,A very good movie that kept me entertained until the end. Movie was solid up until the last 10 minutes as I thought they tried to hard to end it to quickly. MHO. A new way to look at the werewolf legends. Good acting and good special effects. The guy who plays Talan is HUGE! or maybe everybody else is just small. Could have been better with more story/time at the end. Possible WER II?,1527984000,,387,4.173333333333333

6490702,1,B00LM4A21A,It was more like a documentary then a movie. About halfway in you see the horror. There's no werewolf just a hairy man being suspected.

6490704,1,B00LM4A21A,"Boring, followed by gore, followed by boring, and then more gore. Now some might think I speak of a gorey fight or such. Wrong all they do is examine the bodies from the killing in great detail. I did not make it to the conclusion of this movie but it watches almost like a documentary. Follow around a couple geeks, see some gore, and try to prove that  a man whom  we know pretty much from the start of the movie is guilty is innocent. Oh and top off the keg most of the spoken is in French.",1520812800,,493,4.020408163265306
6490705,4,B00LM4A21A,"Different to your usual Werewolf movie, the first half or well even more than half of the movie concentrates of A.J. Cook who plays a lawyer and her legal team (which consists of two guys who want to get into her pants and don't like having competition) defending a pyhsically and mentally disabled man who has been arrested for the murder of a young boy, the boy's father and for putting the mother in the hospital with not a good outlook for survival. She believes the man is being framed for others personal gains and he (or any human) cannot be responsible for the type of wounds on the victims. The fact that Cook is known for being a main character on the TV show Criminal Minds sort of carries weight to her being a defence lawyer believability wise but to be honest entertainment wise, well if you had a less smoking hot attractive actress in the role, I don't think you'd be as into it.  When viewers get to see the killer of the family in the last part of the film, it becomes a lot more like your usual werewolf thriller.  The werewolf (and his special effects) are fairly well done.",1520294400,,1094,4.384236453201971

6490710,5,B00LM4A21A,"This movie was great, I didn't think it was going to be from the start but it turns out to be a bad ass monster flick.

6490711,3,B00LM4A21A,"Started off strong, good plot with interesting characters, but about an hour in it all fell apart.  The special affects were cheesy (the blood soaked sheets looked like Kool-Aid) and the mad 'flying' about was just silliness.  I do give a thumbs up to the cadaver in the morgue.

6490715,2,B00LM4A21A,"Wer is almost, but not quite, a monster movie.  The filmmakers chose to use a faux-documentary style when filming this project.  As a result, the movie is a cluster of bits and pieces, including found footage of a family being killed, a jumbled mess of faux news reports, and an unsteady camera that follows the principle characters everywhere they go.  The story tries to be tense and intense but it's mostly the dull account of a dense defense attorney (a very bland A.J. Cook) who slaps together a case based on faulty supposition and wishful thinking.  Her team consists of two bickering guys mooning over her.  Naturally, she gets it all wrong and a lot of people die as a result.  Even so, she continues to blunder forward, compounding her initial mistake, getting even more people killed.  It doesnt help that all the characters save one (Simon Quarterman as Gavin), are unlikable and dreary.  Cooks performance is narcoleptic, if it wasn't for the constant motion of the camera, I swear her expression never moved a muscle.  Too late, the story turned excitingat the very end.  Up until then its mind numbingly dull, unless you enjoy watching an attorney finagle.",1509494400,,1171,4.839195979899498

6490717,5,B00LM4A21A,"Interesting take on your usual 'Werewolf' movie. What sets this apart from the usual horror flix is the acting, the special effects (appears low/budget but saves the good stuff for when it's truly needed) and the somewhat different concept from your usual monster-movie.

6490725,3,B00LM4A21A,"This film is an interesting variation on the usual werewolf movie.  The variations are both better and worse than the American standard.  It's hard to be more specific without spoiling the film - and it's worth seeing.  It's very uneven - all elements: acting, writing, production - have surprising moments of finesse and woodenness.  Given the location and the story i suspect this is a project from fledgling east European producers.  This film shows promise for the future.  The crew needs to polish up their work though.

6490736,5,B00LM4A21A,"I'm very much a werewolf fan and aficionado, and this is now one of my all time favorite additions to the genre and lore. Very, very different take on the lore and story. The scientific, crime solving approach was a fresh approach. The filming was a concern for me because I typically hate the ""real"" found footage filming style, but it worked very well with this movie and wasn't overdone. While I do love werewolf movies, I am not a fan of gore and there was some pretty intense stuff in this movie. I actually did something I have very rarely done, hit fast forward for one part that was thankfully very well telegraphed so it was easy to know it was time. I've read some reviews say this was ""done before"" and while that is possible, I've never seen anything like it in a werewolf or monster genre. Maybe the other movies did it so poorly that I couldn't make the connection. Either way, the plot development was unique in my experience.

I'm used to seeing a much greater amount of transformation from human to beast than this movie's special effects had, but that helped with the plot and story. While a lot of the ""monster"" special effects were tame by comparison to werewolf classics like The Howling or modern masterpieces like Underworld, they were quite ""real"" feeling. It moved along as much by character interaction as it did by action. The scene on the cover was actually really creepy, even though it didn't go exactly as pictured. The end of the movie was also very well done. It could even have a sequel. Some people weren't impressed, but it left me with a big smile on my face saying ""wow"" and very happy I took a chance on watching it.",1492905600,2,1655,4.4801324503311255

6490800,4,B00LM4A21A,"I'm writing this review because while I enjoyed the film, I wouldn't recommend buying it. It's entertaining despite rather huge problems. The first is that the trailer gives away that Talon IS a werewolf so having 50 of the minutes of the movie leading up to that revelation when the audience who has presumably seen the trailer already knows that....bad decision. The trailer should have been cut differently OR the earlier part of the film should have gone much faster.
The fraud subplot gets pretty much run over rough shod, which is, again, another mistake considering it's importance overall. It needed to have more attention. Some of the script writing was down right painful.

Despite all of this the movie is very engaging especially once you get past the 50 minute mark. But it's not so fabulous that I need to see it again and again. This is basically an engaging, but flawed movie that's fun to watch once.",1449014400,3,917,4.767295597484277

6490826,4,B00LM4A21A,"I was sufficiently entertained by ""Wer"", it's not as grand as so many other people have made it out to be, but the action is impressive and sufficiently violent... In fact, I was /actually impressed/ by it to be honest. The story line, like so many other things these days, is just so ""seen it before"", but you forgive that even as some of the absurdity sets in. The movie carries the first half pretty well, but feels like it loses focus trying to be Underworld by the end, we watched it intently regardless so I feel I'm being harsh in retrospect. The lady says she'll be viewing it again so even though I'd rate it closer to something like a 6/10, 4 stars works if it gets you to check it out. Just make no mistake, it's not some great detective flick that happens to have a monster in it, it's a half episode of Cops with a very angry sasquatch.",1436140800,4,849,4.246913580246914

The story begins much like a legal drama, with Kate, her investigator Eric, and her medical professional Gavin trying their best to attain information and understand what exactly happened the night of the murders. Law enforcement officials believe they have an open and shut case with the hideous Talan as their suspect, and funny as it bethey are right. After about 50 minutes of good development we finally see our first true solid horror, and from then on out the werewolf action takes over. Before this the most horror we received was a look at the mutilated victims at the morgue. Only 8 minutes later we receive the moment every werewolf fan anticipates: the transformation. Talans does not consist of a full transformation to a wolf though, as he keeps a lot of his human figure. While I do not prefer this I won't balk at it. I see it as a matter of ones own opinion and nothing more. The horror written into the film takes full control and provides more deaths than I could keep count of. If I had to guess I would say there are several dozen, so you know the story won't be lacking in excitement.

Co-writer William Brent Bell directs the film, and I am glad to say that he has improved on the direction seen in Stay Alive and The Devil Inside. From the get-go I was hooked on the story and I credit his execution for that. The first half of the film is all development and Bell makes it as interesting as possible by executing it as more of a legal drama than a horror film. This changes when the horror kicks in, giving us the best of both the worlds the story offers. He achieves fair performances from his actors as well, but none of them stole the show. I definitely wanted better execution of Brian Scott OConnor, who portrayed Talan / the werewolf, but he was just OK and not as menacing as he could have been. Aside from that the horror is pretty good thanks to lots of kills and plenty of blood. If you are looking for more than that, like real tension, you won't find it here. The horror is brainless and you get to love it or hate it. I loved the number of kills and the brutality of them, but I hated seeing so much CGI gore. The werewolf transformation was also CGI. CGI has its place in modern horror, but it should be as far away from werewolf films as possible.

Overall, Wer gets a lot of things right and only suffers a few faults that make it less than stellar but still a worthy watch.",1422403200,6,2577,4.355509355509356

This isn't the worst film I've ever seen and it does at least try to go for something  a little different. However to say that this is amateurish would be understatement. It looks like it was shot with an iPhone and lit with flashlights. After a fairly promising setup, the film descends into tedium. The plot Is nonsensical and absolutely riddled with holes. Much of the acting is entirely wooden. It is entirely without any scares whatsoever. I could go on, but frankly, it's not worth it. I'm just trying to save fellow film fans some cash here - do yourself a favor and avoid this silly student project.

As a great lover of that sorely under represented genre, the werewolf movie, I was really hoping for something to get my teeth into, pun intended. This isn't it. If you're in the mood for claws and fur, get out the Howling, The Wolfman (1941), American Werewolf in London, Dog Soldiers etc.

I was generous and gave it two stars; one for at least giving it a go (I think the film-makers had good intentions but tragically,little talent) and one for a great cover. If the film was anything like as creepy as the cover, this would be 5 star all the way.",1414972800,,1332,4.384615384615385
6490931,3,B00LM4A21A,"To start, let's set a few things straight.  I see ""found footage"" mentioned in a lot of reviews.  This is absolutely not, nor even mistakable for, a found footage film.  Second, despite the setting and some of the cast, this is not a French horror filmit's just a horror set in France.

After a hirsute Frenchman of unusual dimensions is taken into custody under suspicion of the ""brutal animal attack-like"" slaughter of an American family, skeptical attorney Kate Moore (A. J. Cook; Final Destination 2, Wishmaster 3) steps to his defense in this unusual case claiming ""there's no way he could have committed these crimes.""

Written and directed by William Brent Bell (The Devil Inside, Stay Alive), our story revolves around the possibly porphyria-stricken Talan (first-time actor Brian Scott O'Connor).  Porphyria sufferers have long weak bones and, if proven to be afflicted, he could not have possibly caused the bone-crushing fatal wounds of which he is accused.  But when the soft-spoken Talan is ""triggered"" during a medical exam for his defense, the plotty tone phases out and the violence is graphic and intense.

Of course, we can't talk about a werewolf movie without addressing the transformation scene.  You ""hear"" it as the bones violently shift in Talan's back and wince.  Some may complain that this scene is far too brief (perhaps 8 seconds), however I defend it in the spirit of subtlety and appreciate that Talan does not ""grow"" by a hundred pounds before our eyes nor shift form apparently.  Rather we witness a truly ""realistic"" take on the werewolf explained by the ""dog boy disease"" porphyria, epileptic seizures, seizure-induced superhuman strength and lunar cycles (e.g., full moon's effect on tides or water).

This film's flaws lie in the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon wire-stunt jumps and throws.  Talan leaps like a superhero in a manner unmatching all things surrounding his character and throws bodies such distances that remind me more of Hulk or Thor than a seizure-strengthened mad man.  Talan also seems to evade a few hundred bullets from dozen-man SWAT team by sheer fleet of foot and runs 60-70 mph in one sceneagain, this just didn't ""fit"" in this movie.  I also really wasn't fond of the ending--but I won't ruin anything for you.

But today I say ""let's forgive this film these flaws"" and just enjoy it for a very different take on the werewolf movie.  The first hour of this film was pretty damn cool and in the best possible taste the word ""werewolf"" is hardly used.",1414972800,,2510,4.938095238095238

Talan Gwynek (Brian Scott O'Connor) a giant of a man who lives nearby is arrested for the crime in spite of the fact it all points to an animal. Katherine Moore (A.J. Cook) an American with French roots volunteers to defend Talan and has two men help her. She interviews Talan's mother who talks about the family medical condition as Katherine claims she may be able to help him. We also find out the family is from Romania, the home of vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein, the Mummy and the Hunch Back of Notre Dame, aliens, and Free Masons.

The film is a good amateur attempt. After they stopped utilizing the hand held camera, they still kept jerking it around a while, even though it was clear no one was filming. It attempts to look at the ""W"" word as real medical condition and not simply as something supernatural.

An interesting film that could have used better actors and a budget.

This is especially strange, given that there's a scene that really, really WANTS to be a transformation sequence, but then seems to lose its nerve partway through.
Wer is all the more disappointing because while the beginning was a bit cliche, the middle showed a lot of promise. You KNOW there's a werewolf in here somewhere, and the movie knows you know, but it looked like they were going to throw some intrigue and mystery into the story. Then that all gets blown away like dust in the wind and the last third of the story becomes tiresomely predictable.

Steer clear of this movie - it's not bad enough to be funny and it's not nearly original enough to be good without that.

I have felt for many years that recent werewolf films fall flat or fail completely. Wer is a new spin on the classic myth, and I loved it. Tight acting, likeable characters, and actual plot held me captive from start to finish. This may have been Brian Scott O'Conner's first film, but I hope he gives us more in the near future.

6490992,2,B00LM4A21A,"This modern conceptualization of the werewolf affliction cant hold a candle to the original Wolf Man. It suffers from all the worst traits of many modern movies:

Almost all the characters (not just the werewolf) are at each others throats, engaging in pointless antagonisms. This ubiquitous, groundless hostility of everyone towards everyone else takes the place of decent dialogue or intelligently scripted drama.

The violence is over-the-top and relentless, so it becomes routine. Victims seem to defy gravity as they are hurled through space. The assaults go beyond any lupine savagery. They simply become displays of special effects. Because the onslaughts lack any subtlety or slow increment, theres nothing scary or shocking about them.

The transformations from man to beast are likewise totally uninteresting. Youd think with modern digital means, something creeping and compelling could be depicted. But hardly. Nothing about this film matches the riveting change that overtook Lon Chaney, Jr. in the original movie.

There are all sorts of muddying, cluttering sub-plot elements here. The action takes place in France, so the presence of American lawyers and detectives has to be explained, and some awkward translations have to be made. Then a medical explanation involving porphyria is dragged in by the ears. This detracts from the moral, melancholy dimension that characterized Lon Chaneys fate.

In short  unless you like NASCAR-like smash-ups simply for the sake of seeing smash-ups  you can skip this movie. Go back to the really humanly moving torment of the original Wolf Man.",1411689600,2,1597,5.415322580645161

AJ Cook plays a defense attorney who wants to be the lawyer for a man suspected of brutally attacking a family of three and partially eating two of them. The man is charged on the basis of his freakish appearance, he is incredibly tall and hairy. However he has the rare disease Porphyria (normally associated with vampirism not werewolf legends) which is crippling is his case making him incapable of committing such savage crimes. The action ramps up once a test is being conducted to see if he does have the disease or not for certain which leads to our alleged killer going on a brutal rampage. The film takes it time allowing you to wonder if the large man is indeed a werewolf or just deranged as a result of his chronic illness. Its a nice change of pace for a werewolf movie and even has a pseudo love triangle which dosnt hamper the plot at all and makes for some nice scenes with the lead actors.",1410566400,2,972,4.375690607734807

I've seen just about every werewolf movie out there, and there were definitely some elements of the usual take on werewolves present, but they were presented in a more logical format. Also, because there is an alternative explanation for the condition of the protagonist, he doesn't actually turn into our preconceived notion of a werewolf. I didn't give it 5 stars because there are several unanswered questions at the conclusion of the movie, and there are also some inconsistencies in the plot which, with any type of analytical viewing are rather blatant.

They should be labeled very clearly, maybe make a shakey cam icon or something.

It's an interesting spin on a classic yarn, and while not without a few missteps, the movie is intriguing, fast paced, and intermittently graphic.

Our heroine (played by AJ Cook) has her heart in the right place as she tries to defend a man she believes has been unjustly accused of a vicious assault. But it isn't long before his viciousness is apparent and she becomes part of the team to apprehend him.

After that, this is all pretty much by the numbers. But that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch.

A more accurate score for this movie is probably 3.5 or 3.75. But I have to give it credit for doing something different with the genre. And I'd encourage anyone who likes ""monster"" movies to give it a shot.",1409616000,5,859,4.493589743589744

6491066,3,B00LM4A21A,"""Wer"" is an interesting semi-modern take on the old Werewolf legend. In many places, it's pretty savvy and clever. However, in other places, it's far too obvious, and the end of the film degrades to one of the silliest scenes I've seen in a long time. The film also feels padded, with a number of ""news"" reports that supposedly should add a real-world feel to the movie, but I found them more like filler; I don't think they added any particular value.

That said, I enjoyed the film for the most part. It didn't occupy my full attention, but it was entertaining enough. There are a couple of genuine freaky bits in the film (though they are partly canceled out by gratuitous ""shock shots"", where something leaps at a character from the side of the frame).

I wouldn't watch this again, and I don't recommend it enthusiastically, but it did pass the time so I guess I'd give it a weak thumbs up.",1409529600,,895,4.484662576687117

1.  I absolutely love A. J. Cook.  She's one of my favorite characters on Criminal Minds.

2.  This film depicts what I would consider a half man, half beast to act and look like.

3.  From the very beginning of the story you're hooked into this developing mystery that quickly turns into an action packed
  monstrosity that had me wanting to know who, what, how, and why?

4.  The scene when his back and face started changing was so awesome and completely old school.

5.  When he landed on all fours...spectacular.  When he started running on all fours...priceless!  And I Loved It!!!

6.  My only disappointment was not having all questions answered.

  > Why did the dad's death end peace?! (That is such a pivotal part f the story and to not have an answer for that was a bit of
  a let down).
  > What exactly happened to create a man beast? Where did the virus or contagion come from?
  > Why did the mother look as though she knew what was going to happen after the attacks?

7. Now other than that, this film is one of those low budget films that clearly can beat out high budget films any day!

This one ranks with the Blair Witch Project, Chronicle, and oh my GOD...Afflicted.  Afflicted took the number one spot in my document horror library, replacing the Chronicle which is still my number one but only after Afflicted. And this movie is right there with Afflicted for me!

The movie opens with a French family being brutally murdered, with one survivor. The police have their suspect, a large, hairy man who looks like he could have done such a thing, but the problem is that he has a bone disease that lets him barely move. A defense team is brought in to investigate, and they are well on their way to clearly the defendant, when during a strobe-light test, they trigger something very bad indeed.

The early part of the movie was well done in terms of plot, dialogue, tension and staging for a legal procedural. One thing that annoyed me during this first part was the question of, why does everyone speak English in France and/or is an ex-patriate American.  It could happen, but for some reason it annoyed me almost to the point of deciding to stop watching for that reason alone.  I'm glad I didn't because the movie dragged me in as the story unfolded.

After the movie shifted into monster-movie territory, the whole thing becomes a very intense, scary gore-fest as the monster is tracked down.  The ending leaves a nice enigmatic close to the question of, ""is it really over""?",1409356800,5,1277,4.653333333333333

6491090,5,B00LM4A21A,"Was that a werewolf movie done REALLY WELL!?!  Yes, it was.  Nice!!!

This ain't your momma's werewolf story.  There is is no ""Team Talan.""  If there were, this werewolf would have eaten some of the team and raped the others.

This movie was fun as hell, scary, and twisted.  You WILL jump in fright a few times at least.  Great writing and cinematography!

Wer is unique in that it tries hard to explain the werewolf scientifically, but in the end admits to itself through a character that there is no other explanation for this horrible ""disease"" and its transformative and maniacal qualities than the legend of the WEREWOLF!

What's cool is that not everything is explained to you about the werewolves, but they are SHOWN to you.  Meaning, you make up your own mind about how much control each werewolf actually has over his actions, how much is understood in the werewolf mind, and whether or not they are ""hiding"" behind their widely accepted medical ""condition"" while in human form.  Also, how much does the moon really affect these creatures?  Do you accept the scientific findings mentioned?  You can easily argue a few ways by the end of the film.  Judge them by what you have seen them do.

The end of this film.  Perfect.  It twists like three times and has you on the edge of your seat.  The final scene will leave you hungry for more, fascinated, horrified, terribly curious!

I enjoyed all of the actors.  In fact, they got better as the film progressed.  Brian Scott O'Connor as Talan was not just a big guy used as a set piece.  He was wonderful.  His eyes were his acting tool in this movie, and they made me believe.  When he explodes into action and becomes the werewolf, he can terrify a stone wall.  Scary stuff.  I'd love to see all these actors again.  Even the smaller parts, like the policemen and the mother were acted WELL.  Always a sign of a movie production that CARES.

So, WATCH THIS MOVIE.  BUY WER, if you love monster movies.  It is genuinely scary, with lots of action divided by lots of mystery--all garnished with lots of blood.

6491097,4,B00LM4A21A,"I enjoyed this movie in it's uniqueness. It re-imagines the overdone and all too often cheesy werewolf films in a realistic and unsettling way. From the first scene of the movie, it gives you a feeling of discomfort. The shaky camera offers realism as well without the dizzying effect that some of the single camera reality horrors convey. The acting is also very good and the special effects were decent. I will say it is very gory for the last 30 minutes or so, perhaps a few of the scenes might stay with viewers as they have done with me, leaving me still with an unsettled feeling as I write this. I would definitely not recommend this for kids under 14 or so, but if you're looking for a truly unique idea told in the context of utter realistic creepiness with some decent scares and graphically violent scenes, this is for you.",1408752000,,834,4.493421052631579

6491100,2,B00LM4A21A,"I fell for the hype and rented this film. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't as amazing and ground breaking as other reviews might lead you to believe. It's gory, yes indeed. As a horror film fan, I find that sort of gore not needed to make a scary film good, not that I am apposed to gore in films. With that said, I feel like if you have to add in 50 heads being smashed in on camera for shock value, it's because your storyline lacks something. Granted this film is about a werewolf and not a happy little fairy, but there comes a point where you just think, enough get on with the story. As for the storyline, it does indeed lack something.. sense. Why are the two male characters fighting and spiteful while trying to save some seemingly poor mans life? The childish attitude makes no sense. All over a chick that shows no interest in either of them until the very end? What?

The acting is somewhat forced and unbelievable at times, but not entirely horrible.

As for this claim of it being a unique storyline for the werewolf genre, it isn't.. at all. Maybe these folks have never seen a werewolf movie or just watched ""Underworld"" like werewolves, but the storyline is fairly basic. The old ""Is it a good werewolf, is it bad, does it retain human emotions"" and of course the ever classic love for a blonde chick. Not unique in any way shape or form.

I'm a huge fan of the original ""Wolfman"" and I didn't mind the recent remake. Even ""The Wolf"" with Michelle Phiffer and Jack Nicholson (pardon my slaughtering the spelling of their names) wasn't too bad. I would put ""Wer"" on the bottom of that list though. It's not as bad as some, but it isn't as great as people are raving about, unless you just like heads smashed in for 2 hours. At that point I'd begin to wonder about mental stability.

It's worth the rent if you're bored. Like with all horror movies lately, expect very little and you won't be disappointed.",1408665600,4,1921,4.387640449438202
6491101,4,B00LM4A21A,"First for the story something fresh and different in a time when we have mostly regurgitated junk with no story. The acting was good, enough so that it allowed me to suspend disbelief, With just another 30 minutes or so of back story I would have given it a five just wanted a little more. It's just so hard to find a new idea these days I wanted more. All in all a very good watch.",1408665600,2,382,4.0394736842105265
6491102,4,B00LM4A21A,"Don't waste time wondering if it's worth the $3.99 to rent... IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT!
Such a great, entertaining movie with a sweet twist in the middle. The acting was great- nothing cheesey. The story was tight and kept you involved and sometimes squinting! The premise actually made sense and was more logical than most movies of this type.
DON'T  read too many reviews; too many idiots writing reviews on this move reveal the ""secrete"". The movie is better if you don't know what's leading up to the secrete moment- when they figure ""it"" out!
Warning though... if you don't like blood- this movie may be a bit much for you to handle.
My only complaint was, it seemed too short! I could've sat another hour.

6491104,2,B00LM4A21A,"It was decent, but, definitely not a top pick for me. I am also not a big fan of Insidious either but I wanted to give it a go.

The acting was ok, the production value was good. The plot was flimsy at best, the twists and turns (if you'd want to call them that) were too obvious. It just felt flat. It wasn't scary in the slightest, I didn't feel any dread. For a werewolf movie that had a lot of potential - it left all that potential in the first five minutes and never bothered with it again.",1408579200,,496,3.96
6491105,4,B00LM4A21A,different yet unique take on the werewolf genre.. it was worth the 3.99 rental.. but being a prime member (for many years) it should've been included at no charge under the prime instant video.. if it had been included it definitely would've gotten 5 stars.. the movies currently included under prime instant video can be hit or miss and there are currently more misses than hits..,1408579200,,381,4.787878787878788
6491106,4,B00LM4A21A,"Excellent werewolf movie!  I won't give anything away, but it was a modern take on an old legend; the werewolf.  The acting was good although the lead actress's character was irritating at times, hence the four instead of a five star rating.",1408492800,2,241,4.714285714285714
6491107,5,B00LM4A21A,"It stared with 'In the Company of Wolves' when I was young, graduated to the rather silly 'An American Werewolf In Paris' in my early teens, then as I got older came along the 'Brotherhood of the Wolf' (Or Le Pacte des loups), but now finally a unique, engaging werewolf film for my adulthood. The Beast of Gevaudan had been reincarnated for the modern audience in this suspenseful, visceral film.",1408492800,7,397,4.685714285714286
6491108,4,B00LM4A21A,"Finally, an original redo of a long-time legend:  the werewolf.  This movie takes place in France (various locales) and opens with the slaughter of two family members--one a child.  The mother survives the attack for a short time; however, she is horribly disfigured.  A local (Talan) is arrested and charged with the murders.  As a defense, his attorney (played by A. J. Cook) wants him to submit to a test to prove he has a REAL disease and is not responsible for these murders.  Bad idea.

There are twists and turns aplenty--enough to keep even the most dubious watcher of these movies (i.e. ME) in suspense.  Yes, there are a couple of discrepencies in the script, but for the most part, this is one of the better movies of this genre in a loooong time.  You are given characters you can actually feel something for, and the extras are not just there to be slaughtered.

This movie is rated R for violence, grisly images, and language.  I HIGHLY recommend this one!",1408492800,3,970,4.614035087719298
6491109,3,B00LM4A21A,"Ok, so, im going to try to review this without giving any spoilers this is a good enough movie for you to watch it and see what you ultimately think. This movie was refreshing in its approach to the old Werewolf myths, the special effects are pretty darn good and the story certainly pulls you along. It was getting a 5 star rating from me up until near the end of the movie. When suddenly a supporting character just sidelines the main baddy, and than at the end were seeing that now this supporting character is just getting away scot free. I don't know, I honestly feel that they dropped the ball with shotty story telling near the end, which sucks, because this movie is really quite interesting and unique.
But that all said, still worth a watch if you enjoy horror movie, especially those which take a stab at old myths, to breath some life into them.",1408492800,4,857,4.430379746835443
6491110,5,B00LM4A21A,"Yes - we have a good monster movie here. The first part of the movie is building the defense of a man who is accused of horrible murders. His American defense attorney sorts through all of the facts to build his defense. The second part of the movie is when the truth comes out, secrets revealed, and bodies start piling up.
There is some gore and lots of shivers.  You care about the pivotal characters. The acting was excellent.
Even my husband, a jaded horror fan, found this movie intriguing to the end. I, as usual, had my hands over my face several times.
So - both Mike and Katie give this five stars and two thumbs up.
I hope you enjoy this as much as we did.",1408406400,5,667,4.2109375
6491111,4,B00LM4A21A,I had not been expecting much. Lately werewolf movies are really disappointing. This one was enjoyable.,1408320000,,103,5.5
6491112,4,B00LM4A21A,"If you enjoyed the fresh take on werewolves from movies like Wolfen and Wolf, then I suggest you make some time for this one. I'm not a huge fan of found footage - but it is used in a way that I didn't find annoying or nauseating and it is only used in certain parts to expand different angles of the same scene (as mentioned before - mostly used via news, interviews, and security recordings)

My love of horror movies comes from a background of ""less is more"" and the unknown/unexplained being more chilling than a gore fest. I also prefer slow-burns, and this movie certainly gives a lot of time for dialogue and build-up, but is unique in that I wouldn't call it slow-burn. There is plenty of action and I would put it into a sub-genre of horror-action if I could. The actors in this are solid and it won't feel like a waste of time. Just don't think you're going to sit down and watch an early 80s werewolf flick like An American Werewolf in London or The Howling. Although, I think horror fans are more than due for something like that.

My only gripes were that the american PI (or equivalent) should have been given more screen time for digging things up, and that some potentially chilling opportunities for story-telling were left out that could have unfolded between him and the commissar, and between either of them and the mother (either of them).

My last gripe is that the last 10 minutes got a little silly/cheesy (think Matrix fighting), with the last minute making up for some of it. Oh yea, this movie is also unapologetic about its gore, but, the gore is necessary device to support not only the legend, but the questions that are raised by characters and the intrigue surrounding some of them.",1408320000,32,1714,4.52258064516129

Anyhow, its a great movie, I recommend!",1408060800,3,370,4.3
6491115,5,B00LM4A21A,"Set in France, though dialogue is predominantly English (some subtitles though , so if you're phobic keep that in mind ), this flick has the feel of the French (in the best sense ). I don't think it is a French film even in part.(though I don't know for sure). Just saying its not what you may expect it to be given typical recent American attempts at the werewolf subgenre. It is more like what I expect from European treatments of horror themes.

 Its intelligent, psychologically engaging, good attention to aesthetics and appropriate dialogue (i.e. mature)  Cant omit the fully fleshed out story and script. Like I said, the film created tension,suspense, and dread. But in the spirit of not creating expectations,the horror is situated in the context of  a legal story. Our main protag, a female ably played by AJ Cook, takes on the defense of a strange bird accused of murder. Pro bono because she is into thwarting miscarriages of justice. So, the pace is handled competently bu it is not one of those rollercoaster rides. It builds the primary story and then the madness ensues. At the same time, a subplot is building so the attention goes between the 2 until the very climactic end. This exposition worked very well for me because when the pivotal horrorific scenes arrived, they made full impact.

The main antagonist was worthy and depicted beautifully. Loved the horror visuals there. The actor conjured his character to the max. Loved him. The other guy (won't say more to avoid spoilers) was off the hook too. I want to own this. Need I say more?",1408060800,23,1561,4.724264705882353
