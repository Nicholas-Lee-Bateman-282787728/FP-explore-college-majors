3664048,4,B001KEGR9S,"This show is done well, and I enjoy most of the Discovery Channel DVDs as well. I have one problem with all of them, though, as well as all of the other documentary DVDs being produced in America.

The times we are living in today are also the titles of SciFi movies from decades ago. Movies that are on DVDs today with subtitles and other languages. Just about every TV series on DVD has the function of Play All except American documentary DVDs. Even the BBC DVDs have Play All and subtitles, so why is it so hard for these American compaines to include these features?

I have the collections of mythbusters, dirty jobs, man vs. wild, et cetra and not one of them so far has had these very common features. Is it too expensive? Are the producers lacking some kind of magic wand that they need to create a play all button on the dvd menu?

What is going on?

Other than that I like these shows and will still continue to purchase the collections, most likely.",1238630400,,961,4.351955307262569

3664053,5,B001KEGR9S,"""Dirty Jobs With Mike Rowe"" is one of the best series ever produced for The Discovery Channel. Rowe, a smart guy who isn't afraid to get dirty, is affable, wry, sharp-witted, and humble. In this collection he tackles numerous horrors and marks the 150th Dirty Job in a celebration in a very unique (and suitably dirty) locale. There's not a single bad episode on display here and some of these are highlights of the series. I was especially enamored with ""Animal Barber"" and ""Big Animal Veterinarian"" (what can I say, I'm an animal lover...) while I found one of his jobs dealing with turkeys to be perhaps the vilest occupation I have ever seen. Some of the jobs are not so disgusting but are terrifying in their own way (see especially ""Steel Mill Worker"") while some are unspeakably filthy (""Barbeque Cleaner"" and ""Floating Fish Factory Worker."") Never once does Mike flinch or refuse to do something that other people are doing, and he is respectful throughout, all while conveying the essence of these jobs to the audience better than anyone else could hope to. This is simply a great set from a great series.",1406505600,,1114,4.747422680412371

3664059,5,B001KEGR9S,"I don't have cable TV or a satellite dish, so I don't get the Discovery Channel. My daughter does and I saw this program at her home. I suggested that she tape it for her father as a Christmas gift. She found the DVDs, Collection 1 & 2 and they were a hit with her dad. I bought Collection 3 & 4 for him for his birthday.
