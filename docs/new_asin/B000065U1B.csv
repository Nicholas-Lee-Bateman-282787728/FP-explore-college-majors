7961338,5,B000065U1B,"I have the City Hunter Series, Movies & Comics and I have seen the Movies & Series in English, Chinese and finally in Japanese. I find that when you watch just the movies as I did at the start, you will be alittle confused especially if you are looking for a lot of detail as some details are cut out like LOTR when they made it into a series.
But if you are after a good action comedy then City Hunter: Secret Service is a keeper. I find somethings you just have to accept as far out facts. Like Kaori (Ryo Partner) who can carry unbelievable amounts of weapons(big ones) and Ryo has the skill to dodge bullets and side step exploding grenades.
The movies like the series (158 episodes) have the right amount of humour and action without sacrificing a story. Remember this is basically a comic book adaptation for kids coming home from school. If you read the Comics and watch the Tv Series. You will find some details that the movies leave out.",1088467200,,946,4.380681818181818
7961339,4,B000065U1B,"Let me begin by saying I am not a diehard otaku. I'm a casual viewer who prefers watching english dubs over subtitles, and don't go into hyperbolic shock if every little syllabal isn't pronounced correctly. I am however, a big fan of animation (been watching all my life practcally); and I've just recently began watching japanese animation. I've only watched a few titles thus far, but so far this has to be one of my favorites. Maybe because I know I'll never see anything like this on U.S. television. Joe (Ryo as he is known in the original version)
Saeba is a perverted detective with a no-nonsense take charge female partner who keeps him in check (he's always trying to feel up beautiful women--even his female clients!) with an odd assortment of weapons that often seem to appear out of nowhere. This makes for some hilarious moments. However the silliness is mixed with moments of good characterization and loads of action. Overall, I would recommend any City Hunter movie (or even the television series if you can afford it--be warned it's a subtitled release only) to fans of both action and comedy. I would've given the film 5 stars, but the movie neglects to provide an explanation for new viewers as to why Falcon (Joe's rival and friend) displays such bitterness and hatred towards one of the villians named Dunkirk. Other than that, I enjoyed it immensely.",1082764800,,1372,4.793248945147679
7961340,4,B000065U1B,"The lecherous mokkori/nookie chasing sweeper is back in action. A political figure hires Mr. Saeba to protect Anna (a cute girl who can beat up City Hunter without Kaori's mallets) At first glance the biggest threat to Anna is Saeba. But when assassination attempts, double crosses, kidnappings, and haunting memories come into play, Saeba is the only person who can put an end to the problems (while still trying to score with Anna).
This City Hunter special is just excellent. Possibly my favorite. A good plot. Plenty of humor and drama (without being too corny or depressing). Some cool action. And of course, City Hunter's mokkori attempts and Kaori's mallets of doom. Dub is consistent with the previous CH specials, except it sounds like they changed Falcon's voice.
A couple problems: At one point in my vid I saw some computer pixelizing (darn ADV quality control). And some Falcon's lines won't make much sense unless you know more about him. Other than that, a very enjoyable action flick. My friend, who hates City Hunter, actually liked this one.",976665600,3,1059,4.955056179775281
