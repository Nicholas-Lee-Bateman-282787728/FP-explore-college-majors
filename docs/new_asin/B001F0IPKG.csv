8300103,3,B001F0IPKG,"During the Salem Witch trials of the 1600s, 19 people, including men, were hung for something they surely didn't cause.  This work posits that what humans see as ""possession"" may be food poisoning by something called ergon.
Really this shows how there's a scientific explanation for almost everything.  Instead of ghouls, gobblins, and spirits, maybe chemicals and environmental factors cause things that humans can't understand.
Here's the thing: after showing 2 or 3 things that point to ergot, the work beats things into the ground by giving 6 or 7 more proofs of that.  I don't know if the work was targeted to skeptics or they went ad infinitum to fill up the space of the program.  They talk about a bog body from 1600 years previous to the aforementioned witch burnings.  It's slightly related, but can be seen as totally different.  In Massachusetts, the infected blamed others as witches; in Europe, work presumes the infected was the witch.
This work is diverse in terms of its interviewees.  The reenactments are blurred and fast-paced.  They are meant to give an impression, rather than ape reality.  In short, the reeanactments are as cheesy as those on the History Channel.
This work leaves me with two big questions.  This and other works say that witch burning pretty much ended by 1700 or so.  What caused that?  Was it just Enlightenment ideas?  If ergot is the cause, how do humans now know how to avoid ergot?  Could there be another ergot outbreak?  A documentary said the Plague ended as humans had more cats that ate infected rodents and that humans started avoiding furs from animals known to have the Plague.  Is there a clearcut way that moderns have avoided ergot?  The work leaves the viewer hanging, no pun intended.",1226361600,,1745,4.841216216216216
