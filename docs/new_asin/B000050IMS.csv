7929068,3,B000050IMS,"Despite the age of the movie, the plot, acting, (and training) of the characters, allow it to still be a relatively good family movie.",1371600000,,134,4.625
7929069,3,B000050IMS,"i got the VHS when i was a kid... i had just read all of Jack London's Yukon adventures and wanted to see this world for myself.... i mean i already had a copy of Call of the Wild.. not accurate, but the dogs were cool.
Well... one day, another favourite show of mine was coming on(Due South) and i had to go out for the day so i set the VCR to record. Later that evening when i finished watching due south i was horrified to discover i had accidentally recorded over White Fang to the Rescue! i mean sure it was a cheesy cheap shadow of the original story, but i didn't want to DELETE it!

so.... its time to upgrade from vhs to dvd....
now for the review..
I wouldnt recommend it for young kids(unless you know your kids) there is a bit of animal cruelty, and child abuse that goes on. not to mention shoot outs and people getting killed.... including a bear who i think was chained up for the express purpose of pit fight.
from what i remember of the VHS the film was gritty, grainy, the sound was poor quality.. its just...... typical.... of the time in which it was made. so i recommend renting first or maybe buying a used copy...",1295136000,,1136,4.187214611872146
7929070,1,B000050IMS,Poor sound and video only makes this poorly made film even more painful to watch.  I loved White Fang 1 and 2 so this was a huge disappointment.  This isn't a Disney film.  It is a cheaply made Italian film.  Poor cliches and acting everywhere.  I love many of the spaghetti westerns but this was horrible.  I couldn't even sit through the whole film.,1183334400,,351,4.40625
7929071,3,B000050IMS,"This is not a bad Spaghetti Western with snow, not bad for the price either, however this is a pan and scan print of obviously a 2:35 to 1 aspect ratio, but most of the action is central to the screen, so not as many ""talking noses"" per say....The print was grainy in some parts but oddly adds to the European feel of the film. Maurizio Merli does a credible job as the good guy and fahter figure to the boys and dog (German Shepard or Alaskan Huskie) and the heavy is played with his usual serving of ham by Henry Silva and a small supporting role by Irish star turned Italian film catylist Donald OBrian. Also for Spaghetti Western, the film is quite mild and very little violence or adult situation. The excellent score is by Carlo Rustichelli who scored several films for the late Gioseppi Collizi such as Boot Hill and Ace High. It has a few extras, for some odd reason an Little Rascal short and a dvd dictionary.  I would like to see Lucio Fulci's White Fang and its sequel released as well on dvd...Overall this is not a bad family film",1059696000,7,1044,4.326530612244898
7929072,4,B000050IMS,"I am very fond of Jack London's novels. White Fang is my favorite. I watched this movie and I like it very much. If you like wolves, this might be a good choice!",989971200,2,161,3.909090909090909
