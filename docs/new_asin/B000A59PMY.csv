2363589,2,B000A59PMY,"I found this DVD dull. I had expected to see actual games, not just snippets of a great shot or great dribbling here and there. This DVD spends way too much time showing people remembering the GlobeTrotters and not enough time showing actual play (and beloved Globetrotter antics).

Very disappointing (unless you are a history buff).",1172966400,22,334,4.964285714285714
2363590,5,B000A59PMY,the Harlem Globetrotters  transended the game of Basketball so many times over. the thoughts of seeing Meadlowlark Lemon doing His Magic is incredible. when Wilt chamberlin calls you the greatest player that speaks volumes unto itself. this is a must watch.entertaining&very educational. the Globetrotters are timeless.enjoy the History.,1138233600,15,337,6.020833333333333
2363591,5,B000A59PMY,"This documentary brings a great piece of American history to life, and gives kids of today's generation an incredible perspective of how professional sports, especially basketball, has profoundly effected society as a whole -- in a good way!

Great effort by the producers; even greater effort by the incredibly valiant Globetrotters!",1130976000,15,334,5.549019607843137
2363651,3,B000A59PMY,Very interesting. Wish there were scenes on playing basketball. It was well presented. They did change the way whites looked at blacks that helped remove the race barrier.,1389484800,,171,5.142857142857143
2363652,1,B000A59PMY,Wasn't at all what I expected.  I got it for kids and they weren't interested in it.  Not that good.,1385424000,,100,3.95
2363653,4,B000A59PMY,In all fairness - I haven't seen the video yet.  I am giving it (and a HG T-shirt) as a Christmas present along with Globetrotter Tickets for my grandson.  He is going to be THRILLED.,1384300800,,183,4.2
2363654,2,B000A59PMY,thought it would have more of their playing skills.....it was more of a racist movie ! wasn't what i thought !,1358380800,,110,4.285714285714286

2363656,2,B000A59PMY,I bought this dvd because it stated it featured Meadowlark Lemon and Curly Neal in their day. From the description I thought it might have a lot of footage of them playing. In this I was very disappointed...practically nothing. It does give a great history of the Globetrotters which I do like but I just felt it was mis-represented.,1313452800,3,333,4.661016949152542
2363657,2,B000A59PMY,"I was disappointed this DVD shows hardly any of the tricks that they are known for. I had to go to you-tube to show my son what I was talking about. When I was a child I remember seeing them on TV performing. They were so funny and impossibly talented !!
I actually didn't know the history of them so I guess that was nice, but without showing them perform it's pretty useless. I wouldn't recommend buying it, I would just go to You-Tube and watch.",1298678400,5,448,4.22093023255814
2363658,5,B000A59PMY,My grandson really enjoy this dvd. I bought this because I wanted his to experience the tricks with the ball. He loves it.,1282435200,6,122,4.3478260869565215
2363659,1,B000A59PMY,"If I could give it no stars I would. No Curley Neal.  Trotters history?  Give me a break.  I'm still waiting for the definitive Globetrotter History.  Needless to say, I'm not going to hold my breath.",1266451200,4,200,4.472222222222222
2363660,4,B000A59PMY,"The history aspects of this DVD are okay and cover the main issues with the Trotters, especially with the 1948 Lakers game, the 1952 Berlin Game with Jesse Owens, and the Trotters place in history. However, they could have included some profiles on the classic Trotters such as Goose Tatum, Meadowlark Lemon, Geese Ausbie (who is interviewed) and WHAT? Nothing on the beloved Curly Neal? Like hot dogs without the weenies!

These items would have made good extras, along with some stuff from the HG cartoons of 1970 for a complete portrait.",1182729600,13,540,4.869565217391305
8074784,3,B000A59PMY,It's more of a documentary. Allot of interviews and talking not as much action as expected. Could have had alot more action/game clips.,1494028800,,135,4.913043478260869
8074785,5,B000A59PMY,Okay.,1480118400,,5,5.0

8074787,4,B000A59PMY,"An overview of the basketball team that has toured the world with the comedy/skill of basketball, bringing along with them the chance to break down racist ideas. They actually played basketball and one of their players signed with the NBA. They played and beat the MN Lakers two times which brought to realization that black players could actually play. Insightful. Some interviews and game footage.",1470268800,,399,5.153846153846154

8074790,5,B000A59PMY,Fantastic documentary revealing the historical role of the globetrotters in challenging and breaking down racist barriers and being ambassadors for equality and brotherhood around the world.  Interviews with everyone from Henry Kissinger to Barack Obama and many others influenced and inspired by the Globe Trotters.  Truly moving and fascinating part of history I never knew. I LOVE this documentary!,1413244800,2,401,5.779661016949152

8074792,2,B000A59PMY,"I didn't watch it myself. Comments from the boy's mother were"".  It was tiring....too much history"".  Perhaps I should have purchased on with more basketball action.",1393632000,,165,5.3076923076923075
