8384701,5,B001ENXX1U,"Samurai Troopers is the original Japanese title for Ronin Warriors, so this is a legit item, despite what the ill educated above reviewer said. Do your research before saying something is fake. This DVD is region two (which is Japan's region code), so be careful of that.",1359158400,7,271,4.787234042553192
8384702,1,B001ENXX1U,Ronin Warriors is what the real name of this should be. This is a boot-leg or remix or whatever you want to call it but this is not the real title and most likly not the true legal version. Cartoon Network ran this series years ago so feel free to verify the title and compare to the image that it posted here. Buyer Beware,1351814400,,323,4.0625
