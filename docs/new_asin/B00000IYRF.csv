1231271,4,B00000IYRF,"Louise Brooks flashed across the magic flickering Silver Screen for oh so brief a moment, only to fall back into almost forgotten lost history.  ""Louise Brooks: Looking For Lulu"" is a earnest documentary hosted by Shirley MacLaine.  It features clips from her dazzling early career, her spotty movie roles, and amazingly, an interview with the once notorious super-star herself. The bouncy teen from Kansas landed in Hollywood in the early 1920's ready to change the world. Her defiant, trenchant attitude didn't suit the studio bosses, but Paramount Pictures smelled stardom, and signed her immediately. Several bouncy roles followed, all featuring the black-haired vixen with the special coif. But Louise's temprament soon pushed her away from the meaty film roles she might have attained. She went to Berlin in 1926 to star in a dark tragedy for German director G.W. Pabst. She portrayed a flighty young dancer, romancing lovers, young and old, rich and penniless. She stands trial for an accidental murder, which occurs during one of her trysts. The proceedings go poorly, and she flees to London, with her young companion, played by Francis Lederer. Her life soon descends into poverty and despair, ending with a fateful meeting with none other than Jack the Ripper. The movie is rich in mood and mystery, featuring an ealy lesbian relationship(banned in the United States).  The film was called ""Pandora's Box"". Brooks's last film(in 1937) was as a b-film co-star in a cowboy movie starring a newcomer named John Wayne. Brooks life took a turn for the worse as well. Her final interview, years later in a Manhattan flat, is breathtaking. Re-discovered by cinema historian James Card, Brooks served out her final days with grace and dignity. This marvelous DVD presents an accurate re-telling of the Hollywood career, and it's eventual pitfalls. Louise Brooks is a cinema icon. Would that this halcyon star might shine forever.",1002844800,17,1932,5.166134185303514
1231272,5,B00000IYRF,"It is amazing that all the information provided about this one time potential star was ferreted out. She was a tremendously amazing lady. The narration by Shirley MacLaine sounds like she closely identifies with Louise's character. I just recently learned that Louise is my second cousin so I was ""blown away"" that there is so much on the Internet concerning Louise. Louise was my Mother's (Mary Brooks) first cousin and my Mother lived with Louise's parents in Wichita, KS in the early 40's. I was never told of Louise until recently as it was obviously unseemly to live the Free Spirited life that Louise obviously subscribed to. I am fascinated by this video as I have a daughter that has similar characteristics and we always wondered where the genes came from. Absolutely fascinating stuff from my vantage point and I will always wonder why I never heard anything about this marvelous woman until 3-4 years ago and I am 56 years old. What a bloody shame!!! A must read for anyone who entertains an interest in women with a zest for life. Killer Video!!!",998524800,7,1058,4.755434782608695
1231273,5,B00000IYRF,"Louise Brooks is without a doubt, the most beautiful woman ever to become involved in Hollywood films.  It is too bad that Hollywood did not have the talent to realize what an asset she could be.  Her claim to fame was the three films she made in  Europe.  (Two in Germany and one in France.)  Once you have discovered Louise, you will reject all others.",996796800,3,354,4.384615384615385
1231274,5,B00000IYRF,"This is a must see for anyone remotely interested in the cinema. Louise Brooks for me is the most beautiful creature ever captured by a camera and this biography follows her from a child to the end. Even as a child she was simply luminous. There are no actresses today who can hold a candle to her.
The biography is excellent - succinct, simple, straight forward, down to earth and to the point. It is not a star worship vehicle. We get Louise and all her problems. It is fascinating. It covers New York in the early 1920s (Louise was thrown out of a hotel for 'promiscuity'!), the introduction of the talkies, the flapper era, Berlin in the 1920s, Marlene Dietrich (who Louise does not appear to like!), and all her movies.
It is also horribly sad. All the people who disowned her - though Roddy McDowall comes over as a genuine friend.
It also proves that it isn't always the so called big stars of their day who become icons and are remembered. I wonder who we will look back on - Tom Cruise and the awful Sandra Bullock or someone we don't even appreciate right now?
It is also a dreadful warning to any young girl who wants to be a star. Louise was 17 when she made it big in New York and she was dreafully misunderstood and used. Child abuse was taboo back then and her adult behaviour was never treated or understood. Today we can see her behaviour as a direct result of the abuse she suffered.
But back to the video. It is beautifully presented. There are scenes from Louise's movies, stills, photos of her family, interviews with her relatives, and a rare interview with Louise herself. And while it does leave you desperate for more it is an excellent introduction and had me rushing out to by Kenneth Tynan's book and all her videos. It covers so much ground in a short time and while it may seem it is all over too quickly it's because the script is just so succinct. We learn as much about the advent of the talkies in 3 minutes as we do in the whole of Singing In The Rain, and about Berlin in 2 minutes than in the whole of Cabaret, and how the studios treated their actors and other actors treated their colleagues than all the other tomes I have read!
Also, Shirley Maclaine's narration is stunning. Matter of fact and very subtle. One of the best things she's ever done! I really do believe that Shirley had her heart in this project.
I have watched it over and over again. Even if you have never heard of Louise Brooks and aren't really bothered to find out about her, there are lessons for life in Louise's story and I am sure none of you will be disappointed.",984009600,,2580,4.354771784232365
1231275,5,B00000IYRF,"Accidentally catching ""Looking For Lulu"" on television sparked my interest in Louise Brooks.  This insightful documentary captures your attention beginning to end with wonderful silent film clips and interview clips from an elderly Louise.  WONDERFUL!",974073600,,251,6.142857142857143
1231276,4,B00000IYRF,"'Looking For Lulu' is a well made documentary of silent star Louise  Brooks. The film's makers have used the one hour running time to very good  effect - there is no padding or wasted time on this DVD. The documentary is  written by Barry Paris who has also penned highly acclaimed books of this  great actress. But of course 60 minutes is not long enough to fully cover  Ms Brooks' career, let alone her entire life. Ideally, I would have liked  to see a documentary twice this length, but the hour we do get is extremely  interesting. Shirley MacLaine does a fine job narrating the DVD, which is  also scattered with movie clips, photos and anecdotes from those who knew  Louise Brooks. The most fascinating feature is interview clips of Louise  herself - filmed in 1976 when Ms Brooks was in her late sixties. These are  quite revealing. On the technical side, I was slightly disappointed by the  DVD's (lack of) special features. The only extra feature is a filmography -  just a list of Louise Brooks' films with no additional information given.  What would have made this disc really special is a gallery showing the  photos used in the documentary plus any others the makers could get their  hands on. One other aspect of the DVD that leaves you wanting more is the  picture quality of some of the old silent film clips - they are truly  exceptional. There is clearly the potential for video companies to release  high quality prints of Louise Brooks' work. Let's hope some of her films  appear on DVD soon.",965692800,4,1514,4.620300751879699

7911771,5,B00000IYRF,"This 1998 film is narrated by Shirley MacLaine (of ""John Goldfarb Please Come Home"" 1965 fame). We get to know Louise Brooks from her own words and those that met her. There is some great stock footage and in the end you feel that you know her better and that she actually talked to you.

The next time you watch her movies you will see them through new eyes and a new appreciation for her acting style.",1506643200,,403,4.233766233766234
7911772,4,B00000IYRF,"I became fascinated with Louise Brooks after seeing her in perhaps her best known film, ""Pandora's Box.""  Frankly I didn't know anything about her but after seeing her in another German film with the same director, ""Diary Of A Lost Girl,"" I decided to look further into her fascinating career.  This 60 minute documentary produced by Turner Classic Movies and Hugh Hefner was directed by Hugh Munro Neely.  It is a well-paced film that looks into Brook's early life as a dancer and film actress and concludes with an interesting interview from 1976.

In Hollywood, she was primarily cast in small roles, but did have the lead in a few.  Certainly an independent woman, Brooks was known for speaking her mind and having a good time.  Both got her in trouble with mainstream Hollywood.  Her first big opportunity came when German filmmaker G. W. Pabst cast her as Lulu, a sexy but somewhat innocent girl whose life takes a tragic turn.

When Brooks returned to Hollywood, she was all but ignored.  She took several years off before returning to the screen with secondary roles and made her last film in 1938.  IMdB shows she only made 24 films after her 1925 debut.  Brooks certainly must be heralded as one of the best actresses of her time, but by her own admission, often bucked the system.  The documentary, narrated by Shirley McClain offers some insight into this provocative star.  Brooks herself provides some first-hand info in some rare clips from a 1976 interview, some 9 years before her death at age 78.

Note, that this documentary is also included in the Criterion DVD of ""Pandora's Box.""",1386547200,,1601,4.774545454545454
7911773,5,B00000IYRF,"Excellent documentary (thanks to Hugh Hefner) about a most interesting woman, Louise Brooks.

7911774,4,B00000IYRF,"""Looking for Lulu"" is an entertaining and informative documentary on the life and careers of Jazz Age actress (and later author and film critic) Mary Louise Brooks. This well-researched, if too brief (one hour), biography includes film clips and interviews with Miss Brooks and her friends and colleagues.

7911775,4,B00000IYRF,"four and a half stars, actually.

Don't buy this DVD seperate--this documentary comes as an extra in the recent Criterion issue of ""Pandora's Box""--an incredible issue of an incredible film.

I loved this documentary when I first saw it but then I read Barry Paris' biography--who also wrote this documentary.  That book is an incredible and deeply moving experience; I don't recall being so moved by a biography before.  That book shows how this film is way too brief--and just begins to get to the heart--and mind--of its subject.  Still, for what it is--an introduction--its pretty damned good!

Buy ""Pandora's Box"" which includes this documentary, plus the complete ""Lulu in Berlin"": Richard Leacock's filmed interview with Louise from the mid-seventies; with Barry Paris's biography, you'll have everything!!",1174176000,22,813,5.362204724409449
7911776,4,B00000IYRF,"Basic information on the life of a fascinating personality. But what should have been intriguing was cookie cutter sterile: birth-life-death-rediscovered.  However, the interviews with an old Louise Brooks were riveting but way too short and the anecdotes from her niece were an interesting look at her personality from the perspective of her family.",1169164800,,350,5.60377358490566
7911777,4,B00000IYRF,"Louise Brooks is often looked over because of her nonchalance about acting and her career. She was a very intelligent woman who was known for her intense sexuality. She made several films, the most important ones being made in Germany like Pandora's Box. Her career was ended when the talkies came, not because her voice did not record well but because she was so arrogant to the studios. Years after she stopped making films, she wrote a series of essays compiled into a book called Lulu in Hollywood which helped to rejuvenate her career.

This documentary is great for novice Brooks fans because it touches on basic information like her early life, transitioning into films, and the end of her career. It does not, however, provide much insight into who Brooks was as a person or truly why she behaved the way she did. It is certainly not a deep exploration into her character or her career. For this, it is slightly disappointing, but recognition is recognition after all, and silent film stars are often lucky to get that.",1147132800,3,1027,4.737430167597766
7911778,5,B00000IYRF,"""Louise Brooks: Looking for Lulu"" is an exceptionally well-crafted and emotionally moving documentary. It is one of the best film documentaries I have seen. Barry Paris (author of the definitive biography of the actress) has written a masterful, sympathetic script. And director Hugh Munro Neely has fashioned a well-researched, balanced and finely documented study of this 20th century icon.

Louise Brooks (1906 - 1985) was incredibly photogenic - some have claimed her to be one of the most beautiful actresses of all time. The many photographic images shown in this film highlight Brooks' life and career as a girl growing up in small-town Kansas, as a Denishawn dancer (she danced alongside Martha Graham!), as a showgirl with the Ziegfeld Follies in 1920's New York, as a bobbed-hair flapper in a handful of American silent films, as Lulu - an innocent femme fatale murdered by Jack the Ripper in her most famous film - the now classic German production ""Pandora's Box,"" and later in life, as an essayist and author of the bestselling book, ""Lulu in Hollywood.""

""Louise Brooks: Looking for Lulu"" features numerous film clips - some of them rare, including Brooks' first appearance in a movie, her first part in a talkie, and her last film, a low budget Western with John Wayne. There are also excerpts from an on-screen interview with the actress conducted later in her life. The film is narrated by Shirley MacLaine (herself a big Brooks fan), and features interviews with actor Francis Lederer, (Brooks' co-star in ""Pandora's Box""), actor Roddy McDowell (a longtime admirer and friend), actress Dana Delany (another fan of the actress), and others who knew Brooks throughout her life. These interviews are well chosen, and help tell the story of her ""life, death, and resurrection.""

Perhaps the only criticism one could offer is that ""Louise Brooks: Looking for Lulu"" is not long enough! (Pretty much everyone who has seen this film wishes for more.) Another twenty or thirty minutes spent exploring Brooks' time in Europe, her decades of obscurity, her rediscovery, and the cult which has grown up around her would be welcome. Otherwise, this film is highly recommended for anyone interested in Louise Brooks in particular or film history in general.",1098316800,3,2261,5.0889487870619945
7911779,4,B00000IYRF,"This is a wonderful documentary with many interviews of personal friends and co-workers as well as famous celbrities today such as Dana Delany and Roddy McDowall. It is narrated wonderfully by Shirley MacLaine. I agree that it is a bit too short, I found myself longing for more - Lousie Brooks is such a fascinating woman in so many ways.
If you're a fan, or you've just became curious about Louise Brooks, then you must get this DVD. It's based on the book by Barry Paris and really lets you see into the life of this charming and usual woman. I love Louise Brooks and I love this DVD.",1045872000,3,587,4.394495412844036
7911780,5,B00000IYRF,"this is a great documentary about this talented woman whos was tortured... by her looks? by her brains? louise brooks is a great cult figure in europe. a denishawn dancer who turned into a follies glamour girl, than later an ingenue in silent movies who cemented her well deserved place in movie history with her explicit performance of ""lulu"" in ""pandora's box"". i don't think america was quite prepared for such a woman... much too open about her sexuality... beside her madonna looks like a pensionist nun... but the ""industry"" punished her for her freedom... can you imagine a movie star ending as a sales girl in bloomingdales? or (as some biographers mentioned) as an ""escort""? her essays are among the most intelligent ones ever written about hollywood.
this documentary is superbly well researched. one is introduced to this girl and becomes fascinated by the woman she turned into... rare scenes from an elderly brooks are a treasure as well as some ""talkie"" scenes from ""the canary murder case""... a ""must"" for every movie lover... i definitely recommend it!!!
