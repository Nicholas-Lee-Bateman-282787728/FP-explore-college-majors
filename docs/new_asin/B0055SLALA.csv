8458729,1,B0055SLALA,"I received this todayand I don't understand whatever language it is he's talking.  Attempting to move the blue seek button faster than the recording is going, causes the entire video to jump back to the very beginning.  To have to sit there and not be able to choose where in the cd I can watch/hear is annoying.  Also, the fact that it's not in English is annoying. Yet,the cover of the cd is in english, why isn't the content? The outside of the cd even says ENGLISH in bold letters.  To listen to the choir sing Glory Glory Hallelujah and not understand a word of it is also annoying. Because of all of this, I am going to return it to Amazon. I also did not receive an invoice with my cd so I am unsure if the content is  correct.  What do a bunch of  gospel singers singing this song have to do with Enoch??  I was expecting something much more than what is here. To be forced to listen and watch the entire cd is not a good attribute of that particular cd. Since I didn't listen to the entire cd i am unsure if it's in english or not, as I only could stand the first part of it, in non-english format.  I don't know or care what the rest of the cd offers.  There is no indication of the content of the cd, except for the Editorial reviews which only speaks of the professors qualifications. In short, I am very unsatisfied, and just as annoyed that no invoice accompanied my purchase. I am going to ask for a refund.",1411516800,,1422,4.175824175824176
