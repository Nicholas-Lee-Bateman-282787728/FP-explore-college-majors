Andre the Butcher was funny so we thought that we would try another movie with Ron Jeremy in it but now I just try to erase, erase, erase....",1502755200,,258,3.9423076923076925

8646656,4,B00IYXNPGQ,"An outrageous gross out comedy of epic proportions. Joe Grisaffi turns in a great gender bending performance as ""Momma!"" If you like scatological humor, this is for you.",1415404800,2,169,5.071428571428571
8646657,4,B00IYXNPGQ,"I could write my thoughts on this movie, but I'll quote a friend who I suggested it to who watched it;  I never thought I'd see a movie that reminded me of Pink Flamingos but sure enough Haunted Trailer brought back all the wonderful memories that Pink Flamingos left me with.",1415404800,2,276,4.411764705882353
8646658,4,B00IYXNPGQ,"You will find this most entertaining; an ancient medicine man is awakened from a very deep dirt nap to create haunted erotic melee in the formidably quite traditional trailer park. Exorcism, BVD's, daisy dukes and bathroom humor contribute to the slap stick adult humor. Trips thru the commode vortex along with the immature behavior of the backwoods brothers will keep you entertained throughout the hour and a half adventure. Ron and Mama bring this flick home buy it now and see for yourself you will not be disappointed I am sure.",1414195200,3,534,4.8791208791208796
8646659,5,B00IYXNPGQ,"Hilarious, wild and really well written flick with lots of jokes that poke fun at all the crazy aspects of life and beliefs that many of us have but don't always share. Fun romp that gives you a break from life. Im glad to see high quality regional films being distributed again. Every bit as entertaining as a studio movie without the attitude. These filmmakers got it right-saw this at a fest and based on some info from a crewmember on Pot Zombies 2 (which also looks great)!",1408406400,2,478,4.443181818181818
8646660,4,B00IYXNPGQ,"As long as you don't take it seriously, and you know what you're getting into (as well you should, considering that Ron ""The Hedgehog"" Jeremy is the demon, this was fun. I mean, how can you take it seriously?  But it's fun and funny.",1406419200,3,233,4.295454545454546
