7893106,4,6305669392,"During the 5 year run of the ""Twilight Zone"" it featured some great stories. Not ever one was a classic and a few were not really good but overall the series produced some of the best television there was to see. Volume 14 in the DVD series of the ""Twilight Zone"" has 4 good examples of just how good the show good be.

""One for the Angels"", the second episode to ever be aired from the ""Zone"" is one good example. Starring Ed Wynn he is a salesman who is good at what he does for a living but there is one longing he has. To make that one big sale, one for the angels. One thing you need to learn quick when you are in the ""Zone"" is be careful what you wish for. That is because Wynn is about to get his wish but it could cost him. This is a great performance by Ed Wynn and ranks as one of those classic episodes in the history of TZ.

Next up on this disc is ""The Man in the Bottle"". Luther Adler plays an antique store owner who comes in possession of an old wine bottle. Except this is no ordinary bottle he soon finds out after he rubs it and a genie appears offering Adler 4 wishes. Like the first story though getting what you wish for doesn't always mean you are getting what you want. Not one of the best episodes but still a very good one with a surprise twist to the third wish most people will not see coming.

One of the more eerie stories from TZ is ""The Arrival"". A passenger plane lands at the airport. Nothing eerie there except... well except there is no one on board. No pilot or flight crew or even passengers. Airport officials can't explain what has happened so the FAA brings in their top investigator to solve the problem. But even the investigator can't totally explain what has happened while at the same time this investigation seems to parallel a previous one he had. This is a pretty good episode. One I would rate as one of the better stories.

Finally the disc ends with ""In Praise Of Pip"". It stars Jack Klugman, who made four appearances on the ""Twilight Zone"" and Billy Mumy who would appear a total of three times during the run of the series. In this story Klugman plays a man who was never very much of a father to his son Pip, played by Mumy. Then he receives news that his son, who is now grown and in the Army, was wounded while fighting in Vietnam. Regret comes over Klugman who just wants one more chance to be with his son and try to be a better father to him. This is a moving story with a fine performance by Klugman. Also interesting about this story is that Mumy's character is wounded in Vietnam. While the United States had military advisers over there at the time we were not fully involved in the war yet and most Americans back then would probably had been hard pressed to find Vietnam on the map or even had heard of the country. The episode was first broadcasted in September of 1963, a year before the Gulf of Tonkin incident would occur that would commit us fully to the war but I am guessing Rod Serling had an idea that Vietnam was going to become an important issue in world politics and made that the choice where Pip would be wounded in the story. This is a classic episode and what makes having this volume worthwhile.

Actually anyone of the four stories on this DVD makes having volume 14 worth having. Whether you are a fan of the series or just becoming familiar with the show this is a good addition to make to any video library.",1410220800,,3397,4.211981566820277
7893107,4,6305669392,"These are the episodes in this collection...

One For The Angels (Episode 2 - October 9, 1959): A salesman (Ed Wynn) cleverly eludes Death. But if he lives, a little girl must die in his place. Only the salesman's greatest pitch can save her!

The Man In The Bottle (Episode 38 - October 7, 1960): A discontented curio shop owner thinks he's finally found happiness when a genie he discovers in an old bottle grants him four wishes. But be careful what you wish for...

The Arrival (Episode 67 - September 22, 1961): A plane lands safely, but all its passengers, pilot and crew are missing! When a veteran FAA investigator is called upon to solve the mystery, his own past provides the answer.

In Praise Of Pip (Episode 121 - September 27, 1963): An alcoholic bookie (Jack Klugman) regrets that he wasn't a better father to his son, Pip (Bill Mumy), critically wounded in South Vietnam. A visit to an amusement park gives them both a second chance.",1393200000,,949,4.597633136094674
7893108,5,6305669392,"IN PRAISE OF PIP was written by Rod Serling and directed by Joseph M. Newman. I think it is the best episode of the Fifth Season and one of the best of the entire Twilight Zone series. I thought the script was very good about a down and out bookie Max Phillips, played perfectly by Jack Klugman, with a tender spot in his heart who tries to make up for a lot of lost time that he missed with his son who he learns has been gravely wounded in Vietnam. Rod Serling's dialogue was so well written and really defines Klugman's character and Klugman himself gives a reciprocally brilliant and touching performance. To give too much away for those who have not seen this does not seem fair. Yet, it is unfair to praise this episode otherwise without revealing some of it. When Klugman wanders into a boardwalk amusement park at night after hours he meets his son, but he is now a little boy. Billy Mumy is that little boy, and Mumy too is brilliant in that role to give his dad one last chance to be with his son, to relive a fraction of moment of those times. His son knows his dad loves him and father asks one final wish from God. God, I love this episode.

I always liked THE ARRIVAL from the thirds season. It proposed an interesting question. An airliner and it is completely empty. How did it land and where is everyone? It is another thought provoking episode written by Rod Serling and directed by Boris Segal. Harold J. Stone as the investigator called in is thoroughly convincing. I was not sure the conclusion is entirely satisfying, yet THE ARRIVAL remains one of the more memorable episodes.

Luther Adler gave a interesting performance in MAN IN THE BOTTLE written by Rod Serling and directed by Don Medford. Essentially it is another tale of being careful what you wish for. Here the results are devastating Adler's performance is totally convincing.

ONE FOR THE ANGELS is an absolute classic from the First Season as Ed Wynn, a sidewalk salesman, must make the greatest pitch of his life to save a little girl from Mr. Death, played brilliantly by Murray Hamilton. Rod Serling wrote this one and it was directed by Robert Parish in a very tender way.",1380153600,,2162,4.510204081632653
7893109,5,6305669392,An absolute must for fans of the Twilight Zone. These are the greatst stories ever told.  A must have!!,1143849600,,103,4.421052631578948
7893110,2,6305669392,"The theme of this quartet of mostly lackluster episodes is ""The Mind's Endless Dimensions"". The first, ""One For the Angels"" is about a salesman (Ed Wynn) who outwits Death but too late realizes that a little girl will have to die in his place. The problem is that the performance by Wynn lacks any credibility in portraying the greatest pitch of all time. It would have put me to sleep, not made me eager to buy.
""The Man in the Bottle"" is about a couple who own a curio shop who buy a piece of junk bottle from a woman desperate for money.
Unfortunately for them there's a genie inside whose wishes in the old cliched manner always end up having negative consequences. For example, when the husband wishes to have great power and rulership of a country he is turned into Adolf Hitler.
""The Arrival"" concerns a plane landing at an airport and manuevering into docking position very normally. The problem is that when the luggage crew opens up the door there's noone on the plane, no pilots, crew, or passengers. So a veteran FAA investigator is called in to solve the mystery. It was a good premise but the resolution is oh so boring.
The best and only good episode on this DVD is ""In Praise of Pip"". It opens in a Vietnam War field hospital operating room where a young man named Pip has been severely wounded and is doubtful of surviving the night. Flash to the States where his father, played commandingly by Jack Klugman, is a man who collects debts for the mob. When he learns of his dying son he wants desperately to speak to him, to redeem his own life and seek forgiveness for his bad parenting. It just might come true in the Twilight Zone.",1086998400,5,1649,4.445544554455446

7893112,2,6305669392,"This DVD features four chapters of the Twilight Zone Series. None of them is really a classic, and all of them are taken from different seasons.  Despite that, they really represent the basic concepts that made this TV  Show an international and timeless phenomena. In  ""One for the  Angels"" (Season 1) meet Death itself  about to take a young girl's  life, but facing a persuasive door to door salesman. ""The Man in the  Bottle""  (Season 2) is certainly about a genie, but an evil one.  ""The Arrival"" bends the boundaries between reality and  imagination for the astonished characters trying to figure out the  misterious appearance of a commercial airplane completely empty.  ""In  Praise of Pip"" (Season 5) stars Jack Klugman (""Quincy"") as a  desperate father anguished by the probable death of his son (portrayed  first by Billy Mummy -""Lost in Space""- and later by Bob Diamond).  All four episodes were written by series creator Rod Serling.",963532800,4,945,4.961538461538462
