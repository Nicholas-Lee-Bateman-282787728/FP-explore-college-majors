1835459,4,B00008DDVU,"so michael moore's movie is well made, entertaining ... and for a documentary, i think that says a lot...i think he set out to try and answer why the US has so many gun slayings, with a presumption that it's due to our obsession with guns. he spends the first 30 minutes making dumb gun owners look really dumb, but that's no big feat. I think the main crux of the movie happens when he goes to Canada and discovers that they've got just as big (infatuation) for guns as america does, with a fraction of the crime. Canada had something like 500 gun slayings last year, whereas the ol' US had over 11,000. So he then had to reevaluate what was behind the bloodthirst here in the states. The answer he comes to, i feel was dead on. The media and an atmosphere of terror and fear perpetuated by the media, which seemed to be a problem only within the US.
Once he carries the audience to that point, the target of the movie should have changed. Instead of continuing to make gun owners look bad, i feel he should have started poking at the media...and he starts to with an interview of the producer of the Cops TV show and an embarrassing scene with a reporter on the scene of the youngest school slaying. But the climax of the movie returns to the original focus and attacks guns. Two scenes, trying to get bullets removed from the shelves of Kmart and another embarrassing interview with an enthused gun advocate, this time the king of the mountain, the president of the NRA, Charlton Heston himself. Sure, the bullets used in Columbine were from Kmart and the NRA used atrocious judgment in showing up in Columbine within days of the shooting for a gun rally. But Michael Moore has already shown us that these things are not at the crux of our murder rate, at least, not directly responsible....So why still attack them?
In the end, i felt like this was a propaganda movie. and regardless of the cause, propaganda with its slanting facts, playing the shell game, or distracting viewers is still wrong. the ends don't justify the means. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to everyone, but i felt in the end that Michael Moore's motives got a little muddy.",1034812800,10,2174,4.506329113924051
1835460,5,B00008DDVU,"All that I can really say is wow.  Michael Moore is brilliant.  The movie was sad, painful, and was even funny and humorous.  I was one of those firm believers in our 2nd amendment but Michael Moore gave me a new perspective and now I'm not so sure that it's good for our country. If you only see one movie this year make it this one.  Sadly, my words just cannot do justice for the praise this movie deserves.",1034726400,,410,4.151898734177215
1835461,5,B00008DDVU,"Latest First-Class entry in Michael Moore's documentary style of filmmaking, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is alternately funny, touching, shocking and heart-rending. A strong anti-gun, anti-media frenzy film, it links the shootings at Columbine High School with perceived flaws in American society regarding attitudes toward guns and gun control.
Sure to be a contoversial film, it is on a par with Moore's earlier film, ""Roger and Me', and ironically has a segment in Moore's home town of Flint, Michigan, when a 6th grader is tragically shot by a classmate. Fans of Charlton Heston may not like Moore's low key, but direct interview! A must see.",1034380800,13,642,5.242718446601942
1835462,5,B00008DDVU,"I had the pleasure of viewing Mr. Moore's new film at the Chicago Film Festival on Saturday.  Even as a fan of his work, the beauty and power were overwhelming.  If you don't leave the theatre feeling angry and disillusioned, you probably weren;t paying close enough attention.  There is little more I can say, the film will speak for itself, if you are brave enough to listen.",1033948800,12,377,4.597014925373134
1835463,5,B00008DDVU,"I just got back from seeing this film at the Toronto International Film Festival and I am stunned at how good and powerful this film is.  Michael Moore attended the screening that I saw and he did a little talk before and after the film which gave it some nice perspective.  It does paint an inacurate (in a good way) picture of Canada as a crime free utopia but during his talks Mr. Moore mentioned that it was done by an  American, for Americans and it is meant to be a bitter pill for THEM to swallow, being a Canadian I could appreciate what he was doing despite the inacurate depiction of my home.  This film gives you an odd feeling, at one time you are laughing at how funny it is, then you are on the brink of tears at the sorrow and shock you receive while watching actual Columbine High School security footage, when you see the children run and the two murderers walk in it sends shivers down your spine.  This is perhaps one of Moores best works and very poiniant at a time like this.
The title itself is quite clever but a little misleading, the focus of the film is Columbine but it also covers school shootings in general as well as the state of America when it comes to gun control and even foriegn policy in regards to 09/11/01.
It opens in theatres in the states on the 11th of Oct. and Mr. Moore commented that he is pleased it opened at the TIFF first as it got a very warm reception with the mostly Canadian audience and he is concerned/interested in seeing how Americans tolerate this work.
A modern masterpiece that is highly recommended.",1031443200,84,1561,4.350515463917525

1835552,1,B00008DDVU,"To try to set up a man and insult him in his own home (Heston) is lower than low.  I wanted to kick Moore off that property myself, by his ears.

With Moore, it's always the instrument's fault, the hardware, the gun, yet he never mentions knives, antifreeze, strangling, or all the other methods that are used every year to commit murders.  All these minutes of film, and he never once mentions the psychotropic drugs that the evil criminal shooters were taking (Big Pharm?), or what moral training they had, if any (parents).  Does Moore ever do any real research or just pander for a ""shock buck""?

This disjointed collage is one long string of illogical and unrelated lies and massive distortions.  Some are so strangely out of place that you will wonder if you are still watching the same film or if somebody sneaked in and changed the channel or dvd on you.  Moore sets out to push his leftist agenda no matter how ludicrous and fantasy-based the claims.  It was painful to watch someone that over-the-top with their own too-obvious propaganda, like something from a silly fool who thinks the common people are not going to notice.  A pure piece of absurdity.  Who gave him any money to do this?",1514505600,,1200,4.617924528301887

As to the film itself it is Michael Moores typical biased rant about a popular issue. I honestly do not remember if he is for gun control or against gun control and I do not care much about which he is anyway. (Two and a half out of five stars)

When they do interviews with Canadians for contrast I thought I was watching ""Canadian Bacon"" with John Candy.

They did mention nukes but did not go to the other extreme and count how many people were knifed and hacked (Lizzy Borden) due to the absence of a proper firearm. No mention of the fact than Kung Fu is necessary so one can kill when deprived of proper defensive devices.

They seem to be fascinated with Charlton Heston. ""Home of the brave and Land of the free""; his presents is peppered throughout the film.

1835699,1,B00008DDVU,"Moore has a problem with facts - he doesn't use many, and the ones he chooses to use do not indicate what he claims they do.
I agree that the issue isn't the number of guns, or the availability of guns that's the heart of the problem. But he's wrong about many of his claims/assumptions including that it's some sort of ""fear"" that's at the root of it.  It's not fear, it's humanistic pride and selfishness combined with a rejection of absolute (biblically based) ideals of right and wrong. Instead of man and woman, it's ""whatever-you-feel-like-being-today"". Instead of right and wrong, it's ""only wrong if you get caught"". Instead of truth, it's ""true for you but not for me"". Instead of true tolerance (live and let live), it's ""you are a hater because you disagree with me"".  The delusion that we are ""god"" of ourselves and that all other ""gods"" must be subjugated to our own will or eliminated is at the heart of all crime, all hatred, all violence. And conversely the inability to obtain that desire is responsible for jealousy, libel/slander, despondency, and suicide.  The problem isn't guns - it's the dismal state of our society's mores. With no mores, there is no limit to the depths the depraved heart and mind can and will go. Guns are only one tool, and not the most destructive, either. Moore and this ""documentary"" can and should be discounted and ignored.",1498262400,,1372,4.708333333333333

Moore debunks current perceptions; when one person in a missile factory says we use these missiles only for defense Moore shows a montage of governments we have bombed, democracies we have overturned into dictatorships, and the cost of those actions. This will aggravate the flag pin wearing crowd but the truth hurts. He also attacks liberal views such as poverty and overabundance of guns causing the violence; if that is so then why is Canada with almost as many guns and twice the unemployment rate have 1/10th the murder rate? He then goes on to relate bowling to Columbine...a seemingly irrelevant comparison yet it is as relevant as any reason you've ever heard for gun violence. We know it isn't true...and that it's likely that all the other things we've heard are just as untrue. So what's the answer? You'll have to watch it to find out.",1497916800,2,882,4.809210526315789

However, I really liked ""Bowling for Columbine"" for it's twisted sense of humor, it's gentle means of portraying a serious message and the fact that Moore apologizes to one woman he interviewed who began to cry. I'd heard somewhere that Moore never apologizes. Obviously, that's not true.

There also times when Moore clearly states what his opinion is, which I also liked. I would have liked him to show where he got some of his statistics (although a quick Google check shows he was on the ball about his main point -- America does still lead the world in gun murders, or at least did in 2015, according to NPR.)

1835926,2,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore raises a supremely important question: Why is there so much gun violence in the United States; but he does not answer it because there are no easy answers.  Masking himself as a reasonable person, Moore uses a certain amount of charm to engage individuals who he sees as part of the problem and then cuts them off at the knees when they answer as well as they can or tsks at them when they refuse to be humiliated.
If Moore finds the subject tragic, that really isn't evident, unless you count sticking a photo of a deceased child in Charlton Heston's face; is it with the expectation that he will prove himself to be the worst sort of person or suddenly change his mind about guns?
The movie gets 2 stars just because this is a difficult topic to address and and thing that stars a conversation is a good thing.

1836118,2,B00008DDVU,"I can't say I know that much about Michael Moore so I didn't start out with an opinion of him prior to watching this...now I can't decide if Michael Moore is lazy, not very bright, or a combination of the two.

First, I watched this movie over 4 different sittings simply because it only held my attention for 30 minutes at a time. There is no common thread tying the various segments...video of the Columbine shooting (interesting but nothing not already mainstream), video of random assassinations (again, interesting), then half-witted, dead-end interviews...an interview with a former producer of the TV show ""Cops"" that goes nowhere...a half-witted discussion with an LAPD officer working an active scene where Moore asks him about prosecuting contributors to air pollution...talking to Canadian teens about their opinion of the US (who cares?)...and on...and on...and on...

Second, still trying to figure out the title of this movie...again, is he trying to be clever? If so, he should get his facts straight since the movie begins with his commentary that Harris and Klebold bowled the morning of the mass murder...no they didn't...so...really causes the viewer to question every point he makes, every statistic he produces, the rest of the way.

Third, Moore makes a point of dragging two victims of Columbine to K-Mart headquarters where they embarrass themselves trying to get an audience with executive leadership to talk about the bullets K-Mart sells...and, wow what a victory that it only takes a day for K-Mart to declare that they'll stop selling bullets! What did that really accomplish? Now even more people will be shopping at WalMart! Bravo Michael Moore! Congrats on that achievement! Why wouldn't you take on this fight and move to the next major retailer of bullets (you created a media stir so why not continue to the next major retailer)?

Moore does uncover slivers of brilliance (and again, trying to figure out how he completely misses the boat toward a meaningful pursuit of answers). First, a dad of a Columbine victim asking why the Tec-9 semi-auto handgun is available in the US (an extremely lethal and cheap weapon used by the Columbine murderers) and second, Moore's interview with Marilyn Manson (where the freakish Manson steals the whole movie in 3 minutes). Manson alone saves this movie from a 1-star review (and I couldn't name any of his songs so can't claim to be a biased Manson fan).

Fast forward to the end where, AGAIN, it's hard to believe Moore misses the point of HIS OWN MOVIE. He dupes Charlton Heston into an interview (in his own home no less) and, rather than ask the then-NRA President his thoughts about the Tec-9 (or semi-auto guns in general), he squanders his perfect opportunity asking if Heston will apologize to the residents of Flynt, Michigan for the timing on an NRA rally. REALLY? I would expect this question from a junior-high videographer but not a learned adult...and the interview is so embarrassingly dim-witted...Moore concludes the movie with sewn-together footage of him haranguing Heston with the picture of the girl killed by a handgun. Heston's had enough of Moore's idiotic questions and meanders back inside his house as Moore (the hero? the buffoon?) chases after in this fictionalized sequence.

Again, what is the point Moore is trying to make? At one point he seems to make gun violence a racial issue (via a caricature cartoon of whites fearing blacks and the aforementioned ""Cops"" interview where he implies that the show over represents white cops arresting black males) then zeros in on a black six year old boy shooting a white six year old girl. So is it white society vs. the faceless black male or not? Had I watched this when it came out in 2002 I would have asked the questions and arrived at the same conclusions. Moore could have narrowed this movie to an all-out campaign against the Tec-9 or semi-auto guns in general - and that would have been a noble and worthwhile effort - but he stumbles and bumbles his way through a half-witted discourse on gun violence in general with no purpose, no rhythm and, ultimately, no conclusions. It's no surprise he's not considered mainstream based on this lazy effort.",1476144000,,4207,4.951841359773371

1836135,1,B00008DDVU,"Moore tries half heartedly to pass himself off as not anti-gun by showing us his childhood shooting rifles, but too many times during this tediously long and poorly shot and edited collection of scenes.

He criticizes the media for instilling fear in the public, yet resorts to a tried and true media tactic of 'man on the street' interviews with seemingly moronic people whose comments had my eye twitching more than once.

Moore slips in off handed commentary throughout that clearly reveal his disdain for the establishment and, like every other liberal extremist out there, wants to blame everyone else for the actions of the degenerate elements in our society. He paints south central LA as a veritable Garden of Eden with an undeserved reputation for crime and violence, and asks police officers if they're going to arrest someone for the smog in LA; while they're investigating an active crime scene.

I didn't care for him before; believe it or not after watching this piece of garbage, I dislike him even more.

I watched this because my fiance insisted I do. She knew I didn't like his other stinking turd ""Fahrenheit 911"" but thought this might change my mind.

Moore takes a tragic event and makes a bunch of indictments about the armed forces, capitalism, post-World War II U.S. foreign policy and welfare reform -- everything the Left loves to hate about America. His style is as bad as the media sensationalism he's attacking, hardly that of a professional journalist.

The one interesting point in the movie is where he mentions that it's almost as easy to get a gun in Canada as it is in the U.S., yet the homicide rate in Canada is nothing compared to that in the U.S. He could have made that the main focus of his movie. (Independent verification of the Canadian gun laws and homicide rate would have been necessary though.) But I guess that would have meant no other swings at the rest of American society, and probably fewer ambush journalism moments. It would have been more like a PBS documentary, and less of a movie about Moore's own ideology.",1472083200,2,924,4.634146341463414

1836139,2,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine, 2003 film

The film starts by showing a North Country bank in Michigan where a depositor can get a free gun. [How much money is needed?] Michael Moore shows his sense of humor in these opening scenes. Can a dog commit a crime in Michigan? Moore is incorrect in claiming Gandhi ""beat the British Empire"", that statement is incomplete. One scene shows a student's interest in chemistry. Some live news scenes follow, but the film doesn't explain them. Recognize them? Then a short history of US political coups and massacres in foreign countries since WW II. Moore associates the terrorist bombing in Kosovo (no military objective) with the shootings at Columbine high school. Next we see Charlton Heston standing up for his right to travel peacefully to an NRA convention. Outside a small group protests the right of the NRA to peacefully assemble! (How un-American!) Moore shows the views of some students. What does this say about their Educational system? Next Moore interviews a singer; is any musician or actor a reliable source of wisdom? Bowling can be educational, according to these scenes. Moore's statistics are biased since it does not compare the rates of violent deaths. That frantic cartoon is not historically accurate, a mistake for any ""documentary"". Killer bees are in fact invading America, along with fire ants.

More scenes follow, they are either biased and racist, or, reflect the reality of an oppressed people. Who was blamed when blacks were scarce as in late 19th century American cities? Some people say crime rate was falling but the corporate media featured crimes in the TV news. Really true? A producer explains the rationale of the ""Cops"" TV show. Does it reinforce prejudice? The film shows a small town in Canada; it has few murders (like a similar small town in America). One good question is why the murder rate is lower in Canada. [But if it is just about the same as in America, why ask?] Small towns in America may have the same unlocked doors of small town Ontario. Creating fear is a well-known method for controlling a subject population.

Moore points out how bad economic conditions are reflected in a high homicide rate, but this is not ""news"" for the corporate media. Basically, it tells how poor people are oppressed by having a long commute. Maybe they need public housing located close to their job? The stunt at the chain store that sold bullets seems unfair, I wonder why that chain later suffered an economic setback? There is a final interview with Charlton Heston. Moore's question about the murder rates seems dishonest (look up these rates for yourself). The rate of violent deaths in Canada is similar to the USA. Given Canada's northern latitude it should be lower. Did Moore drag out the interview to cause Charlton Heston to leave for his next appointment? If so, was this honest? Moore is a skilled showman if he can make this collection of scenes into popular entertainment.

Documentaries lie on the continuum between news and fiction. Anything real, filmed as it happens, is ""news""; except for sports, it is rare on TV. Fiction must appear plausible to be believed by the audience. Documentaries are ""recreations of authenticated facts"" like the nature films on TV. They are created and edited to portray a point of view. Their success depends on the number of consumers who pay, dollars not academic truths. The use of films for propaganda (a point of view) follows the use of newspapers, pamphlets, and books. Some are better than others, and age gracefully. Did Moore create scenes by splicing together separate events? Are speeches taken out of context? Are events portrayed without their background? Its all part of Show [me the money] Business, the art of getting people's money in return for telling a story. Does exploiting the Columbine massacre show poor taste by Michael Moore?

One Big Lie is that America has more gun violence than other countries. That is as true as saying America has more automobile deaths than other countries. America's rate of violent death (suicides and murders) falls behind France, Switzerland, etc., and Japan, but just ahead of Canada. Canada's crime rate was lower before 1977 when they banned handguns; now it approaches American rates. There is no mention of Mexico, Brazil, or Argentina, who have similar colonial and revolutionary pasts. Any research will reveal these facts, which are usually suppressed in the Corporate Media. If America was such a violent hell on earth there wouldn't be 3,000 illegal immigrants each day! They flee ""gun free zones"" like Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala.",1470009600,,4627,4.9728682170542635

What I did find intriguing is his attempts to pin down why there are so many more deaths by guns in the US as opposed to other countries with lots of guns in circulation.

1836274,4,B00008DDVU,"Probably the best part of this video is at the beginning where Michael Moore learns that a certain bank is giving away guns as a promotional gimmick.  He goes in there, gets his gun, and says to the clerk something to the effect that ""Isn't a bank a bad place to give away guns?""
She just looks at him dumbfounded.

The rest of the movie spirals into an indemnifying treatise on how much America loves guns.  Of course, cementing all together this whirlwind of astonishing facts, interviews, cartoons and more is the terrifying reality of what happened at Columbine High School when two students decided to go ballistic, literally, and kill more than a dozen students at close range.

One of the startling facts is the town of Virgin, Utah, which passes an ordnance requiring everyone to carry ""a gun.""  The camera then pans to a resident, who smiles and says that ""this is a great place to raise children.""

Another startling fact is when Mr. Moore takes a couple of victims of gun crime (one is in a wheelchair and both were shot by people who purchased their ammunition at the local K-Mart) to the local K-Mart, where he finally succeeds in arranging a meeting between management and victims.  Their aim: stop making it so easy to arm oneself.  Their meeting is deemed successful, as K-Mart promises to stop making the purchasing of ammunition so easy.

But what is not successful is his interview (some would call it a cornering) of an ageing and not much longer to live Charlton Heston.  He asks his some questions, which Heston quickly learns are the questions that only a liberal could ask, and quickly excuses himself.  Mr. Moore is left to leave a picture of one of the children who was a victim of gun control, on the doorstep to Mr. Heston's house.

We've got high school foo, bowling alley foo, school cafeteria foo, quiet suburban neighborhood foo, angry white man foo, bored white kid bent on destruction foo, NRA foo, and all other types of foo.  In fact, we've got foo galore.

1836317,5,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine is a documentary written, directed, produced, and narrated by Michael Moore. The film explores what Moore suggests are the causes for the Columbine High School massacre and other acts of violence with guns. He focuses on the background and environment in which the massacre took place and some common public opinions and assumptions about related issues. Aside from that,it also looks into the nature of violence in the United States.

On April 20, 1999, shortly before they began their infamous killing spree at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold attended their favorite class, a no-credit bowling course held at a bowling alley near the school, the same bowling alley which would become the scene of a robbery and triple homicide two years later. While pondering these events, Moore humorously considers the link between random violence and the game of ten pins; along the way, he calls on the Michigan Militia; spends some time with James Nichols, brother of Oklahoma City bombing accomplice Terry Nichols; visits K-Mart's corporate offices with two teenagers injured in the Columbine massacre as they ask the retail chain to stop selling bullets for handguns; investigates the media's role in the American climate of fear and anger; compares crime statistics in the United States with those of Canada, and questions actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston regarding his appearance at a pro-gun rally held in Littleton a few days after the Columbine massacre, and a similar rally in Flint, MI, after a six-year-old boy killed a classmate with a gun he took from his uncle's house.

In this documentary,Moore skillfully lays out arguments surrounding the issue and short-circuits them all, leaving one impossible question: why do Americans kill each other more often than people in any other democratic nation? He focuses his quest around the shootings at Columbine High School and the shooting of one 6-year-old by another near his own hometown of Flint, Michigan. By approaching the headquarters of K-Mart and going to Charlton Heston's own home, he demands accountability from the forces that support unrestricted gun sales in the U.S. His arguments are conducted with the humor and empathy that have made him more than just a gadfly for he's become a genuine voice of reason in a world driven by fear and greed. Though it may not always convince everyone,it asks important questions and provokes thought about gun control.",1423699200,,2508,5.190123456790124

1836347,2,B00008DDVU,"I have been a fan of Michael Moore for years, as his was a voice that was courageous and needed to be heard.  I have also been a supporter of conflict resolution strategies most of my life, always looking for ways to resolve issues without violence.  It is truly part of who I am.  As a former professor I have even taught graduate level courses on the topic.  I also know that what I taught I always tried to make part of my life, and remember how difficult that was, and how often I failed.

Back to Bowling for Columbine, though this film made many good points, I believe Moore's conversation with Charleton Heston should not have taken place.  The discussion between the two of them, itself was violent as Moore's purpose was not to really hear Heston's point of view, but to ridicule him.  When will we learn that violence can be thrust on others through what we say -- our words, or our intentions to do harm, rather than help another.  So it is not just guns that can promote violence, it is us, especially our mouths which can be horrible weapons of violence and harm.

Part of a conflict resolution program for children teaches kids appropriate ways to make their own points without violating the rights --  of others -- or said another way, without inflicting their own anger and violent energy upon others.  As I said, this is something to think about.  To me, this conversation undid what I think Moore wanted the film to do.",1411344000,13,1437,4.484615384615385

1836421,3,B00008DDVU,"This should probably be noted as a quasi-documentary, as much of the ""facts"" are presented in such a non-linear fashion (and in a short-attention span format more akin to viewers accustomed to watching cartoons rather than adult information stations--and I don't mean CNN folks!), but it is nonetheless entertaining; however, Moore is an entertainer, and his film (to me anyway) comes off as more of a joke rather than a true portrait of a corrupt country. While Moore nicely avoids the real problem at stake in terms of the tragedy of the title (these two boys did not shoot up a high school cafeteria just because they owned guns) he nonetheless takes time to satirize enough political figures and famous faces to make the insulting trip worthwhile. America has problems, yes, but that's not what permitted the Columbine tragedy. Moore can be funny, but the climactic attack on Heston seems both unfair and unnecessary; I am a bit biased here because I like Heston, but I'm equally tired of people complaining about children getting killed by guns but having no issue living in a gun-toting country--can you spell ""contradiction""?
As for the presentation on the DVD, the picture is a bit rough, but no worse than VHS quality. The extras make it worthwhile, however. The Charlie Rose segment is worth watching, but a bit brief in my opinion. For kicks, the Marilyn Manson video has been included. Moore has, like the much touted Quentin Tarantino, become a fixture on the comedic celebrity circuit, and it is, probably, better than working for a living. However, the intellectual bankruptcy is apparent from the very beginning, so be warned. He's out to amuse and to insult, not to inform or to inspire. Nonetheless, he's the cash king on the quasi-documentary circuit.
Is ""Bowling for Columbine"" a must? Absolutely not. It promises to dissect the effects of violence upon community, and does just the opposite. It purports to be educational, but I can't imagine any serious-minded teacher using (with a straight face) in his/her class. But if you are looking for a definition of how sick and ill-informed our media has become, this might be the ticket--Moore at times sounds reasonable, and then you watch his films and you realize that he really doesn't have that much to say--or, more importantly, ask.",1383350400,,2306,4.945876288659794
1836422,5,B00008DDVU,"I think the controversy that surrounds this movie stems from the label 'documentary'. Think of it more as falling into the category of 'personal statement'. Yes, it's one-sided, and it borders on propaganda. Gun-lovers will hate it, and gun-haters will love it.

But with all that said, Bowling for Columbine is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Moore sets out to prove that we Americans are a bit neurotic (well, flat-out crazy) about guns, and he does make a pretty good case. He manages to get non-stop laughs out of a pretty grim topic, and he does a great job of profiling gun culture here in the US.

Just don't go in expecting Truth and Enlightenment. The film is a pure opinion piece. You may agree or disagree with his opinions, but in either case, you can have a good laugh about our crazy love affair with guns in this country.",1383004800,,837,4.573333333333333

He accompanies two students who were crippled by the Columbine High School shooting to K-Mart headquarters where they eventually get an agreement from company executives to stop selling ammunition that is used on human beings.  The film leaves the viewer wondering, ""Why is it that we in this country kill each other at such an alarming rate?""

We can focus our attention on safety or prolonging life by whatever means but NOTHING...absolutely NOTHING is gonna save ANYONE from the death that is coming so quickly upon them.

1836520,5,B00008DDVU,"Be advised, when watching Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" (2002), that you take your own politics into the theater with you.  Or rather, your politics walk into the theater with you and sit next to you, munching on your popcorn and sipping from your soda cup while constantly whispering in your ear, telling you how you should feel regarding this energetic, in-your-face, deliberately provocative documentary on guns in American society.  And such, I surmise, is exactly how director Moore would want it.

The title, of course, refers to the Columbine murders of April 1999, when two heavily armed students at a Colorado high school killed 13 people and injured 24 others before taking their own lives.  Moore reports that the two killers attended a bowling class in the morning before committing the murders, and uses that bizarre and random factoid as the basis for a reflection on gun culture within the United States.

Moore manipulates interviews, animation, and file footage with a dizzying degree of kinetic energy.  Many of the scenes in the film are now staples of American popular culture: the bank that offers a free rifle to anyone who opens a new account; the ""Wonderful World"" sequence when Louis Armstrong's melancholy classic is juxtaposed with a historical collage of violent U.S. interventions in other countries, climaxing with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; the ""South Park""-style ""Brief History of America"", an animated vignette setting forth Moore's thesis that the American fascination with guns reflects a culture of fear (sociologist Barry Glassner, author of the book ""The Culture of Fear,"" is interviewed at a couple of points); Moore's comparison of gun-rights-oriented America with gun-control-minded Canada; his visit to a Michigan elementary school where one child was fatally shot by another; and, perhaps most famously, a visit to K-Mart corporate headquarters, where one of the survivors of the Columbine murders seeks to return the bullets with which he was shot.

""Bowling for Columbine"" won many awards, including the 2003 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.  It is well-made and consistently interesting; and at the same time, I'm not sure I would call it a documentary.  I am a liberal Democrat who would be likely to agree with Moore on most issues; and yet, when watching this movie, I sometimes find myself growing frustrated with the more openly manipulative elements of ""Bowling for Columbine.""  His films are worlds away from the restrained delivery of, say, an Errol Morris documentary; I think they could be referred to more accurately as ""reality movies.""  Moore makes himself the main character of his films -- stalking the halls of schools and stores and corporate boardrooms in his loose-fitting black jacket and Michigan State University baseball cap, consoling the bereaved, seeking information from experts, confronting the complacent.  It is blatantly self-serving, and at the same time it is compulsively watchable.  Like it or not, ""Bowling for Columbine"" always keeps the viewer interested.

One of the most powerful moments in the movie, for me, is also one of the simplest.  A long visual collage of talking heads setting forth their theories regarding Columbine is followed by Moore's interview with Marilyn Manson, the shock-rocker whose music was cited by some as a supposed ""cause"" of the murders.  Asked what he would say to the people of Columbine, Manson replies, ""I wouldn't say a single word to them.  I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did.""  The simplicity of the wild-eyed shock rocker's answer eloquently gives the lie to the revealed ""wisdom"" of so much of what we hear on TV every time there is yet another hideous act of gun violence somewhere in the U.S.A.

The film climaxes with Moore, an NRA member, interviewing then-NRA leader Charlton Heston.  Heston assumes that the interview will be friendly, but quickly learns otherwise.  Does Heston deserve what he gets, or do you find yourself feeling sorry for the aging movie star of yesteryear?  Watch for yourself and see what you think.

Liberals and progressives tend to like Moore's films; conservatives and traditionalists tend not to.  But I think the film does what it sets out to do.  However you feel regarding gun rights, or gun control, or whatever you want to call it, chances are that when you're done with a first viewing of the film, you will want to seek someone out and talk with them regarding guns in America.  And that, once again, is how I think Moore would want it.",1352332800,3,4573,5.064
1836521,5,B00008DDVU,"I have seen this movie before I finally purchased it. I have wanted it for a very long time. Bowling For Columbine is perhaps the greatest documentry ever made. It's an Oscar winner and critically acclaimed film that will for many years be a classic of a socialogical issue that has been a hot button topic privately and politically in our society for many years, gun control.
Michael Moore is a master at getting to the core of the topics he deals with in his films. Moore will continue to raise awareness for issues that we all must recognize and take action with.
A MUST SEE MOVIE!!",1348012800,,585,4.4766355140186915
1836522,3,B00008DDVU,"This movie asks way more questions than it answers. Perhaps all documentaries are like that, but in the other Michael Moore movies I have seen to date, ""Roger & Me"" and ""Sicko,"" Moore seemed to have a far clearer idea of what might be done to fix the problem. In spite of his triumph over K-Mart, he does not seem to be suggesting that a gun ban is the answer. But then, his interview with Charlton Heston didn't really give him a chance to make any suggestions, either. Indeed, Moore is far more into ambiguity here than I would have expected. In fact, the best suggestion came from a comedian that suggested the price of ammunition should be raised to something like $5,000 per bullet. He jokes about the guy who says, ""Boy, I'd shoot you right now if I could afford it.""

Of course, it is a very tough topic. Why do other countries have so very much lower rate of gun-related homicides per year? Certainly nothing so simple as guns per capita: Canada has far more guns per capita, and an amazingly low gun-murder rate. But then, Canada's population density is tiny compared to ours. And the difference in climate is also relevant. Passions cool pretty quickly up there in that northern clime.

One of the crimes on which Moore places a good bit of focus was the little boy who took his uncle's gun to school and shot one of the girls in his class. They were both six years old at the time. But when he confronts Charlton Heston about it, why doesn't Heston point out was not that the boy's uncle owned a gun, but that he was a very irresponsible gun owner, or the boy would never have gotten hold of the gun.

My own attitude about guns can hardly be called unbiased: My Steve committed suicide using a hand gun, one of several he owned. But he was by no means a ""gun nut."" He had them for two reasons: (1) self-defense and also defense of his home, and (2) the purpose to which he ultimately put it. He needed a gun to feel secure against the possibility of being forced to stay alive under conditions he found intolerable.

But it is also true that people do need to have means of self-defense, as they police are not generally there when someone breaks into your home or attempts to rob you. They will show up later and write up the facts, and possibly even arrest the guilty party; but they cannot be everywhere at once. As one Michigan State Militia member points out, it is your responsibility as an adult to defend your home and your family.

The Second Amendment gives us the right to bear arms and specifically mentions ""a well-regulated militia"" as the reason. But there's that word ""regulated"" to consider. An outright ban is not only unconstitutional, but unenforceable and ill-advised. It is a true cliche that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. It is also true that the first thing a tyrant does is confiscate all the guns in the hands of the citizens. But certainly we want to keep guns out of the hands of six-year-olds and psychotic high school students, as well as gang bangers, robbers and people who are not in control of themselves.

In the course of the movie, any number of people mentioned that the reason the US has so many guns is that we are consumed by fear. And they rightly point out that mass media and marketing pump up that fear because fearful people are easier to manipulate. The primary thing that struck Moore (and myself) about Canadians is they are not nearly so fearful as we are. Nearly everyone owns a gun, and with all that wilderness, Canadians are very big on hunting, but they have nothing like the gun crime rate we have. Why? What to do about it? Moore does not seem to have an answer.

I don't have any easy answers, either, but Moore and a couple of Columbine survivors DID manage to persuade K-Mart to stop selling guns and ammo.",1336953600,4,3801,4.452586206896552

1836525,5,B00008DDVU,"I'm always hearing and reading about people who hate Michael Moore.  They say that he's just into making documentaries for the money, the impact of his documentaries sometimes does more harm than good, some of his facts are wrong, he edits scenes to make them fit better for the points he's trying to make, and on and on and on.  Americans on the whole should salute this guy.  At least he's doing something about what's wrong with our corrupt and heavily flawed society, while all the complainers sit back and do nothing.  Or, they themselves are guilty of a lot of the things that Michael Moore presents in his documentaries, so they hate him for exposing the truth.  This guy is a great American.  From ""Roger and Me"" to the present day, his documentaries shed light on the appalling things that go on in our society.  So many Americans are tunnel-visioned and can't see the big picture.  Or, they have their heads in the sand altogether.  In contrast, Michael Moore sees the big picture and shares it with the world.  Not everybody agrees with him, but at least he's out there looking out for us.

In a nutshell, Bowling For Columbine (2002) sheds light on the causes of violence and gun use in American society and the overall negative impact these things have.  Of course, this information presented in this documentary doesn't apply to everyone.  Not everyone is going to have a warped mind as a result of playing video games or playing with toy guns.  This documentary compares American society to other countries as well.  In my opinion, it's a fair and balanced documentary.  Not everyone will agree with that, but again, this guy at least is bringing such issues to the public's attention.  People can criticize this guy all they want, but after all the smoke clears, he's way more of a positive for America than a negative.",1328140800,2,1835,4.684375
1836526,4,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine is a film documentary which contains numerous overt and inconspicuous undertones to it regarding gun laws in the U.S. As a viewer it is important to be objective and to consider this work as a collection of researched opinions rather than precise facts. Michael Moore paints a grim picture of loose gun laws and bullied teenagers having easy access to weapons. I tried to avoid feeling manipulated by any assertion that Americans have a tendency towards gun crime. With this in mind I was able to appreciate that most gun owners follow the law to the letter, and it is illegal gun distribution, and a vast minority of gun owners who actually break the law. This film is worth watching as a caution to people to use weapons lawfully and responsibly.

I hated the ending where Moore tries to humiliate Charlton Heston who was close to 80 years old at the time and was generous enough to let him visit him in his home.  Moore starts out by saying he was an NRA member and then attempts to villainize the organization.  He poses a few lame questions to Heston and ends by asking him to apologize for some ill timed visits to areas that had recently had some gun homicides.

He uses emotion, to highlight the tragedy of Columbine, but fails to point out the more than a dozen federal, state, and local laws broken by the two teenage killers that day, or if trained staff had been armed, might have help save lives. He does not stick to any facts, just molds certain events to play to his gun control myths. The interview with Charlton Heston (done with dishonesty and made to be a hit job) was a farce.

I've seen all his movies -- including Canadian Bacon -- and there's not a single moment that wasn't funny, tragic, and true all at once.

So clearly I'm biased. So what? Like the one-star reviews aren't biased, or just planted by the NRA (a bunch of squishy dweebs who care more about face time than any Constitutional issue). But this one film in particular always stands out among the rest. Sicko and Farenheit 9/11 are focused on specific issues, but Bowling For Columbine is the only documentary (by anyone) that tries to get to the heart of contemporary America and explain why we keep shooting eachother.

And it ain't the guns. Anyone who watches this will see pretty clearly that Moore isn't blaming gun culture -- Canada's heavily armed and they don't even bother locking their doors at night. And for anyone who figures we're just violent by nature, there's the recent history of Germany to disprove that easy explanation.

So what is it really? Moore tapdances around it for most of the film but he argues (and I and Mark Ames agree) that what causes this violence is a toxic mix of bullying, paranoia, and economic misery. This stretches from the savage subcultures of high school -- and Moore actually ASKS some students what high school is like -- all the way to how our economy is structured. That last one is illustrated brilliantly by Moore showing how DoD spending is the only thing besides Wal-Mart those kids can look forward to after they graduate. Anyone who didn't want to laugh and cry at the scene with some pinhead expressing shock that kids would try to resolve their problems through violence while an ICBM is being assembled in the background either has no soul or is working for the Cato Institute.

Since the subject, which sometimes seems to be nothing less than the nature of American society itself, is large and self-contradictory, it seems only fitting that the film (and the filmmaker) should share those attributes.

1836639,4,B00008DDVU,"Moore is saying that Americans live by a triple-threat, which is a threat directed back at us and sometimes outward. We have been de-sensitized to violence, our access to weapons is too easy, and our Media concentrates on sensational, often racist, depictions of violence, sustaining the first two areas.
Moore's research reveals that our number of murders per year is unaccountably beyond all numbers from other ""first world"", yet they too have been desensitized and have a media which has heavy coverage of violent events. He seems to be saying that number two - the easy access to guns (and the unpopular ""waiting period"") - really prime the pump.
His segment on ""Welfare To Work"" is ill-conceived, however. Of course, busing an individual an hour away to work seems inefficient and socially questionable, but it must be assumed that in most cases the implmentation makes geographic sense. So is Welfare better than Work? I think Michael might want to try another Documentary for that question.
Another marginal segment is with the elderly Charlton Heston, the NRA Rally Man. It is shocking that he says he did not know of the one on one shooting near the spot of a recent event. But the viewer gets the sense that the interview is more rhetorical than really interesting.
Another old guy that Moore bothers is Dick Clark, but for a much less understandable reason: seems DC has a terrible habit of hiring people who desperately need a job: he employs the Mother of the six year old boy who shot the young girl, in a tragic turn of events. Do these ""Old white men"" bear all or som of the blame? Are they the ones who force the child's Mother to ride a bus forty miles away from home for employment? That's like...an hour on a bus!).
Eliminating these three sections and creating *one* involving the ""stand-off"" situation at Columbine - in a feature segment, Moore mentions his agony in deciding if such scenes would work in the film - would have been powerful.
In the end, however, his naive, slackjawed, hackish hippie-with-the-redneck bent journalism takes a back seat to an amazing display of backbone - he guides us through his *own learning experience* - he begins the film saying that guns are too available and have been made too desireable in his country but then discovers other ""first-world"" countries have the same situation - he admits to the viewer that while he was looking at tragic numbers he was ignoring the basis for them (in his opinion): we seem to have been programmed to grab a gun to help settle a dispute.

Those things are very far removed from day-to-day life, it would be like saying that something in Los Angeles affected the children in San Diego. Southwest part of Denver is also a really liberal place; it's not the NRA gun toting wild west as it is portrayed in this.
Also there were things in there that made it seem like he was putting words in people's mouths, especially the Marylin Manson interview where it was made to seem like he was being respectful of the families and canceling his Denver performance. THAT ISN'T EVEN CLOOOOSSEEE to how it was. Kids who listened to Marylin Manson and KMFDM were taken a back by this so much that they wouldn't broadcast that they liked them because there was the inevitable witch hunt that proceeded the events. Nobody would have purchased tickets that soon, no concert promoter would TOUCH a Marylin Manson concert at that time. I've noticed in all of his documentaries he capitalizes on poor decisions made right after troubling and confusing events, waits until everyone forgets and then swoops in. In the first few days after 9/11 people were acting very irrationally, which is 100% natural given the onset confusion and hostility that comes from that. I will let anyone who didn't feel any sorrow, any hostility, and any fear cast the first stone if you disagree. You can't film drunken guys at a bachelor party and say that's the kind of people they always are. I'm also saying you can't vilify or iconize people who are simply protecting their own interests.",1241827200,16,2437,4.604597701149426
1836641,5,B00008DDVU,"I was reluctant to watch this movie at first, because I thought it was only about gun control... which I don't necessarily believe in.  It is not even about gun control, but rather shows how Americans are so violent because the media corporation keeps us afraid.  We live in this state of fear, so we go out and kill people when they make us angry, in the name of religion, or defense of our families.  Very, very good movie.  Michael Moore is one of the most patriotic people I know of-  because he actually gets involved in the welfare of our nation.",1238976000,3,552,4.372549019607843

What appalls me the most is the way he ambushes Charleton Heston with things that aren't true. Heston is obviously not at his best and in the early stages of Alzheimers. His lack of recall is show as a way to depict him and all 2nd ammendment supporters as uncaring and callous. It would have been much fairer to everyone if he had been able to give that same interview 5 or 10 years earlier. Taking advantage of old people is just sad and I find Moore to be a sad individual indeed.

This movie uses the Columbine shooter to jumpstart a discussion and investigation of the 2nd Amendment and why the United States has more gun related homicides than any other nation. Michael Moore is a card-carrying member of the NRA so he is not completely biased. I really liked how he went to many different groups trying to get all perspectives on this hot-button topic. He even traveled to Canada to see why they have such a lower gun-related homicide rate.

This movie will definitely open your eyes to the 2nd Amendment debate and make you question why people feel the need to own so many guns, when a lot of times all it does it ruin lives. It also makes you wonder why our gun control laws are so weak and if they were stronger, maybe Columbine would have never happened.

1836695,4,B00008DDVU,"I prefer this Micheal Moore movie to most of his others.  I agree with his point that fear is perhaps the one characteristic that separates Americans from other western cultures.  Each year we are bombarded with images and video that is intended to promote fear in our lives.  Election campaigns teach us to fear one side or the other ratherthan advocating what good a candidate will do.

Once fear is in place groups like the National Rifle Association can inform us how we need all sorts of conceal and carry laws because if we don't carry a weapon, sooner or later we will be attacked.  Solve a gun problem with more guns.  It sounds like trying to solve the credit crisis with more credit.  The NRA will say that because we don't know if a person has a gun, we will be less likely to become violent.  Yet 11,000+ people are killed with guns each year.  Only a handful of situations occur where someone with a gun can prenvent a crime.  The NRA also has the audacity to say that more guns in schools will prevent shootings similar to Columbine or Virginia Tech.

Micheal Moore tries to flush out myths people tend to blame for shootings.  Violent video games, rock music, even the availability of guns.  Most other countries have all of these, yet they do not have 11,000+ gun-related killings annually.  Again, he may have something with his fear theory.  Like Moore, I too am a member of the NRA and proud of it.  Our constitution gives us the right to own guns and no government can take that right away.  I just wish we wouldn't be so darn afraid of everything.",1226102400,4,1568,4.4840989399293285

Michael Moore hurts. He exhibited this specific cultural violence in the USA which is absolutely not the case in English Canada (Toronto) where weapons are those of game hunters and not those for men hunting.

Columbine was one of many theatres of a ""folly"" (is this the case when there is repetition ? As Michael Moore, I do not think so) a deadly mass murder perpetrated by a student on pain of living.

1836699,3,B00008DDVU,"BFC's very success as a piece of art is its undoing as a piece of social commentary. Before I go on let me briefly sum up the film: MM attempts to discover what is wrong with America- specifically violence in America. The Columbine shootings in spring of 1999 are MM's starting point. MM tries to point out the dubious links posited by the media monster- brilliantly portrayed in a montage of `scares' thrown out by the media- things from Halloween candy to weight loss products. This is an avenue worth pursuing, & the `scaring' of Americans into becoming consumers of anything that will substitute as a nipple is a great point. But it's made by shock rocker Marilyn Manson (a Columbine scapegoat), not MM, & then immediately dropped. MM also is at his best when he details corporate America's need to portray black men as `the problem' despite far more crime being perpetuated by white & white-collared sorts. Instead, we get a whole bunch of amusing, but pointless red herrings- the Michigan Militia, the Nirvana of Canadian existence (aptly showing how good the Canadian health care system is, but woefully neglecting the severe curtailing of Canadian civil liberties- most notably free speech- in pursuit of this goal), workfare programs- which I agree are terrible because they perpetuate an underclass, yet do not let a bad single mother whose 6 year old son killed another 6 year old girl off the hook (as MM tries to imply), a nasty Dick Clark- who employed said bad single mother for slave wages in a mall restaurant, a doddering & senile Charlton Heston- whom MM dishonestly snookered in to an attack interview, & then- in the film's most pompous & sickening moment- left the murdered 6 year old's photo on Heston's property, as if to imply that CH was responsible for her death- not the boy, nor the mother. I admire- & LOVE- how MM uses the media's tools against them in such a screeding fashion. But he has become what he hates with this distortion. Nowhere does MM follow up on the public's & media's appetite for sensationalism- instead he uses 2 dimwitted boys who survived being shot at Columbine to shame K-Mart in to removing bullets from their store's inventory. 1 can argue the rightness or wrongness of this act- I think they were within their rights to demand such, but it's ultimately a futile act. BUT the point is this was not done for any other reason than to bring MM's film to a climax. Instead of showing a problem, discussing its causes, & effects, & then proposing a solution- which a true documentary does, MM's film simply drops the ball at the end, settling for its own 2 hours of sensationalized splendor in MM's sun. The film is much more about Michael Moore's need to preen & pat himself on the back, than in provoking any real debate. Behind us, at the theater, was a typical professorial type who Pavlovianly jeered at the right wingers, tsk-tsked at the appropriate moments of their stupidity, all the while, under his breath, mm-mming at the enlightened left wingers who, truthfully, to an objective viewer, came off being just as stupid as the Michigan Militia men- in their own predictably obtuse ways. Think long of Pogo's injunction about enemies while viewing this film.
  Still, the film would make Leni Riefenstahl proud. & it would make `true' Liberals proud, as well, were the film not so laced with  truths & such. MM has stated that he thinks only 10-20% of people who see his work will get it right away- therefore he has to distort with humor. Well, the same ratio might apply when it comes to the truth in MM's docs....In short, Bowling for Columbine needed alot more true depth, & alot less Moore.",1220832000,6,3655,4.7078125

1836701,4,B00008DDVU,"I recently tackled this movie again, and it's still good and worth watching, there were aspects of it that I disliked more this time around.

The film isn't strictly about gun control.  While Moore does mention that they are tons of guns in this country, he also mentions that Canada has tons of guns as well (more per capita than the US), yet Canada doesn't have the amount of violence that we do here.  Moore also points out rather telling of our culture of fear, where the news media constantly tells us we're about to die tomorrow from everything to blue jeans to bottled water.  Everything is going to kill us.  He also has a great interview with Marilyn Manson, the rock star who was ""responsible"" for the Columbine killings, despite the fact he wasn't at the actual shooting and two teenagers actually shot all the students.  Moore hilariously points out that the US was bombing the bejeesus out of Yugoslavia during this time (a pre-emptive war on a country that did nothing to us, sound familiar?), and Clinton himself said ""we need to teach our young people to solve their problems with words, not weapons.  Now y'all excuse me, I have to authorise more missiles and kill more civilians"".  Clinton didn't actually say the 2nd line, but he might as well have, as that's exactly what he did.  In other words, Moore makes some good points, and the film is not really about the gun issue but is about the violence issue.

Moore's tactics, on the other hand, are questionable.  He brings some survivors to the Kmart headquarters to ask for their money back for the armor that's embedded in their bodies.  It's an example of ambush journalism that Moore has to realise by now it isn't going to work. It's just done for show and nothing else.  All he ends up doing is embarrassing people at Kmart headquarters, the victims of the shooting for going along with the stunt, and himself.

The worst tactic is his interview with Charlton Heston.  Heston, as we all know, was the head of the NRA for many years until he resigned when he admitted he had Alzheimer's.  When Moore interviews Heston, it's pretty damn obvious from Heston's speech and movements that he's having difficulty staying coherent and on point, and Heston seems confused by Moore's aggressive tactics.  Moore must have realised that Heston was suffering from early Alzheimer's, and instead of engaging the man in a civilised manner and taking into account that he really wasn't all there, Moore pressed on anyway and bullied the ailing actor.  Granted, I'm a Heston fan, but I think it would have made a much better (and more humane) interview had Moore given more background information on Heston and treated him as a man who was suffering from Alzheimer's.  Heston was actually a liberal during his hollywood heyday.  He marched with MLK (a few years before it became ""alright"" in the eyes of Hollywood and the country), and he supported both JFK and Adlai Stevenson.  Moore has selectively edited before (he did actually interview Roger Smith of GM for his film Roger and Me, but decided not to use it and pushed the lie that he didn't get an interview with him), and I feel that he probably did this to Heston to.

While I feel this film is worth watching, I have more mixed feelings about it than I did before.",1219968000,4,3283,4.663194444444445

1836703,4,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine is, like all of Michael Moore's films, a well-made and entertaining film. I believe that it has value, even if, as its detractors claim (and apparently with some justification), it isn't always scrupulously honest in its presentation of the facts.

Michael Moore may feel that he is serving some higher purpose which justifies a certain amount of misrepresentation. Maybe he believes that his *message* is true, which allows for some shading on the particulars. I don't agree with that point of view, and I don't respect any intentional deception on Moore's part, but I think that this doesn't devalue Moore's work altogether, so long as the viewer is discriminating and willing to ask questions. After all, there is propaganda on both sides of every issue, so it isn't as though Moore's films require some special skill unique unto them. No, Moore's films just require that we be critical thinkers, which hopefully we are in the first place.

In Bowling for Columbine, I was fully willing to be lead down whatever path Moore chose. I expected the man to drive some solid point home, notwithstanding arguments to the contrary or further investigation. What I found, however, was that Moore was slightly unclear in his expose on the nature of gun violence in the US. ""Slightly unclear"" is weak; actually, he's pretty muddled.

Moore doesn't want to blame cinema, video games, etc. (and allows no forum for those who would blame them), but seems willing to blame the violence in the news, and American engagements overseas... Do we really think that children are more inspired to violence by, say, reports from Afghanistan, than they are by the Matrix? How many kids regularly even watch the 6 o'clock news? I've heard stories of children doing violent things based off of what they've seen in professional wrestling, or Beavis & Butthead, or Grand Theft Auto, but I've never heard of any instance where a kid said he was inspired by the bombings in Kosovo.

Now... I, myself, don't blame movies or video games either, but that's not my point. My point is that Moore wants to uphold these ideas of ""influence"" when convenient to him, and drop them when not. Later, he debunks the idea that a country's history has direct ties to its gun violence (i.e. all of the blood that Germany has on ""its hands,"" yet its people are peaceful)... but offers up missile construction in Littleton as suggestive evidence of what might have caused the Columbine massacre.

Moore thinks that the problem is the easy availability of guns and ammunition (K-Mart), but notes that this isn't really true in Canada (where they find similar product in a Wal-Mart). So... if Canada can have a lot of guns & ammo, but not the same rates of violence... then... why blame the problem on such availability in the US?

It would be one thing if Moore finally tossed up his hands and said -- ""Well, gosh, I just don't know what the root of the violence is!"" but that's not what he does. He feels free to blame the availability of guns when he wants to strike against K-Mart, and to debunk the guns argument when praising Canada; he is equally as convinced of either side of the argument, depending on which segment you're watching.

Moore, at times, feels that ""fear,"" foisted on the American public by our ratings-hungry media, is the root of our violence, and seems to suggest that there's nothing really to be afraid of (hell -- we should be like Canada, and leave our doors unlocked at night)... but then presents statistics that seem to infer that America *really is* more violent (and an epidemic of school shootings, right?)... so which is it? Is there really nothing to be afraid of but fear itself? Or do we have a violence crisis, and are justified in locking up at night? Both. Neither. Again, it depends on the segment because Moore has no cohesive, consistent point of view in this film.

Moore shows off his ""life-long"" NRA membership, but never troubles us with an explanation as to what could prompt such a thing. He (seemingly) agrees with Charlton Heston that the right to keep and bear arms is a good thing, but lampoons the 2nd Amendment as a hick defense against people of color in his cartoon history of the United States.

In short, this film never aspires to the heights of propaganda because the best propaganda has a clear message. Moore is always clear, but pulls in different directions at different times in his movie, depending on what best serves his immediate purpose. If a person keeps it *all* in mind, from beginning to end, they realize that Moore ultimately doesn't know what the cause of American youth violence is.

And... that's fine. Neither do I. And I would respect this film more if Moore were more upfront about it. Instead, he strongly blames the NRA, and overseas military engagements, and the media, and gun availability, and exhonorates all of the same, in turn, when it suits him.

It was sad, but yet amusing how he convinced Walmart headquarters to ban the sales of gun ammunition in stores. It was impressive how he tried to find every possible reason as to why America has such a high murder rate. Race, poverty, violence in music and video games, violence in our history, and even the growth and production of hand guns. None of these could lead to the reason behind his questioning. What I found most interesting about this film was when he went to Canada. He walked up to a few houses and saw how the natives there do not lock their doors. He was also informed that there was only one murder in the last three years in Canada. Coincidentally, I ran into an acquaintance that used to work in the forensic labs for the Miami Dade Police Department a couple of days after viewing the film.

Fear. Americans clearly fear everything, and most particularly change, and creativity. Since solving the above problems requires creativity - certainly conventional thinking isn't getting anywhere!) - and action, we are stuck. Unless we face the issue of fear and the constant barrage of fear-based ""information"" we live with, we will never be able to change anything. How scary is change? Given how much we have all been hurt by the current healthcare system, how many of us have been destroyed financially by rampant, unregulated industries such as credit card companies, and basic safety because of lack of safety regulations on imported goods - how can we question change? Because we  are being bombarded with how frightening it will be to have, gasp, ""Socialized Medicine"" - would it be worse than what we have now? No, but the specter of this is heralded as if it would be run by boogeymen. Why would a single American oppose regulation of the banking industry? What on earth would cause us to allow major companies to send jobs out of the country, while collecting enormous tax breaks for employment? Fear, fed to us by our fearful leaders and the media. While all of Moore's other films provide us with information and ammunition to go for positive change - this film gives us the basic change that must be made before any other action will be taken.

1836752,2,B00008DDVU,"""Bowling for Columbine"" attempts to find an answer to a complex question: why do Americans kill each other more than any other industrialized nation (with guns)? As complex as this question already is, Michael Moore seems to make the answer absolutely impossible. In his attempt to find out why, Michael Moore constantly contradicts himself and leaves out several key points of information, and sometimes tells the wrong story. HIs points also have false conjecture in them.

Michael Moore explores the many reasons given as to why Americans kill: poverty, high divorce rates, minorities, violence in the media (including movies and video games), America's violent history, and simply, lack of gun control.

#1: Poverty: Michael Moore points out a liberal argument that poverty in America makes one commit crimes, he counters that by saying that Canada has a higher unemployment rate (at twice the rate of the U.S. at the time this documentary was made). However, Michael Moore seems to have a lack of understanding as to what poverty really is. ""Poverty"" is defined as having an income below the ""threshold"" (the least amount of money that can get you by depending on where you live and how many people/children/elderly live in your household). ""Unemployment"" means you do not have a job AND are looking for a job. Unemployment, to an extent, can tell you about the state of a country's economy. However, many of the world's industrialized nations have much more generous unemployment and welfare benefits. In some cases, it might be better to remain unemployed than to settle for a low-wage job, unlike here in the U.S. where welfare and unemployment benefits have been cut to the bone. Many people in poverty here in the U.S. actually do work, but can't make enough money to make ends meet. Another point is that every other industrialized nation provides health care and many provide universal college as well. Also, the boys from Columbine were not poor, so why did they shoot all those kids and teachers?

Point of contradiction: Michael Moore describes a school shooting incident involving a toddler African-American kid who shot a toddler girl in his grade. His mother could not look after him very well because she was forced, as part of a welfare-to-work program, to take a bus miles away from her house, and work a low-wage job. Had she been able to look after her child, could this have been prevented? Most likely, but does this not contradict Moore's earlier point that poverty does not cause more crime?

#2. Divorce rates: Moore counters a point made by conservatives that the divorce rate and the ""break up of the family"" in this country is causing us to commit crimes. He looks at England, and says that they have a higher divorce rate. But then again, if Moore is so convinced that ""unemployment"" means ""poverty,"" England does have a lower unemployment (at least they did when this documentary was made).

Point of contradiction: if that toddler boy (mentioned above) had a father around, wouldn't the shooting have been prevented?

#3. Violence in the media: Michael Moore points that every other country watches our movies and many violent video games come from Japan, but they don't experience these problems. However, this is where we get to what appears to be Michael Moore's silly theory as to what causes violence in the U.S.: ""the media pumping us full of fear"". In other words, because our media reports on violent crimes (and other scary things that could happen to us), we commit violent crimes. Is the media supposed to stay silent every time a murder occurs.

Point of contradiction: Michael ridicules those who say violence in the media causes violence in reality, but he contradicts himself when he claims that ""pumping us with fear"" causes us to commit crimes. Again, it's all about violence in the media.

#4. America's violent history: Michael Moore attempts to counter those who say our violent history is a reason for us being violent. Moore points out the violent histories of Britain and France in their colonies, as well as Nazi Germany, but then says that all these countries have low violence rates. However, Michael Moore GREATLY contradicts himself soon afterwards with his ""History of America"" cartoon, which portrays the history of America as a bunch of scared white people shooting everybody. Also, during his ""What a Wonderful World"" sequence, Michael Moore lists many of the violent ""acts"" committed by the U.S., whether through funding, weapons supplying, or direct invasion, in attempt to show that the U.S. does not make weapons only for ""defensive"" purposes. I will make a few points on this:

a. During the 'What a wonderful World"" sequence, some of Michael Moore's points have incomplete information and are somewhat erroneous. For example, the ""4 million kill(ed) in Southeast Asia"" has to do with the Vietnam War. Also, Michael Moore fails to note the percentages of the casualties from all of the U.S. interventions were rebels, soldiers, or civilians.

b. The United States did not give money to or train ""terrorist groups"" or ""Osama bin Laden"" to ""kill Soviets"". The Soviets, first of all, invaded Afghanistan in 1979. We decided to help fund, supply, and train the Mujahadeen (a.k.a. the Afghan Rebels) to fend them off. After all, we were in a Cold War with the Soviets. Osama bin Laden could very well have been one of the freedom fighters, but he was not on our radar as a ""terrorist"" back then. Second, were we to just sit there and watch Afghanistan fall to the Soviets? Watch them as they massacre Muslim children?

c. MIchael Moore says that in 1991, we ""Entered Iraq, reinstated dictator of Kuwait"". This was the Gulf War, where the entire world was on our side here in a clear-cut case of aggression when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. We did bomb a little bit of Iraq in order to get Saddam to stop but this was a war started by Saddam.

d. Michael Moore vastly contradicts himself by listing these ""violent acts of the United States"", and then go on to say that a country's violent history does not make it's citizens more prone to violence. Also, Michael Moore seems to correlate that on the day of Columbine was the biggest one-day bombing campaign in Kosovo, and he lets Marylin Manson say, ""Well, the president is dropping bombs...don't you think that causes violence?""

So what does cause violence in America? Perhaps we will never know, and Michael Moore clearly didn't. Since Amazon requires one star, I at least will give it one of my own because this documentary is funny at times and makes interesting points. But as for Michael Moore's overall points, he does not make them at all. A very weak documentary from him, indeed.",1203465600,13,6708,4.889182058047494

(3) Charlton Heston comes up for heavy stick in this documentary as president of National Rifle association. He seems to turn up for rallies at locations where tragedies using firearms have just occured.

(7) Then arrives to the bush legacy and does his usual enjoyable bush bashing.

(8) Concludes that America's addiction to guns which leads to the violence is due to an atmosphere of mistrust and fear that he supposes is brought about by the politicians (read BUSH) and media. He cites examples of citizens in canada who don't lock their doors.

(9) He concludes that people in US are predisposed to guns and thus violence because of the lack of trust among one another. He concludes

(10)that Americans think as 'I' instead of 'We'. He leaves us with the message that when we change that attitude to 'We' only then our nation will reverse itself from it's current violent trend.

1836783,3,B00008DDVU,"I originally became aware of Michael Moore after viewing his well known documentary ""Roger and Me"". I enjoyed the film, but unfortunately never found the time to view his later efforts, Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine. Both films were always on my ""films to watch"" list, but I guess I needed a good kick in the rear to get around to it.

I finally got that ""kick"" after watching his Amazing documentary ""Sicko"", which I feel is one of the most important films of the past five years. After being completely awestruck with ""Sicko"", I decided it was time to view both Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for columbine. Here are my thoughts....

[SPOILER ALERT] I will be revealing certain aspects of the film within the following portion of my review.

While Columbine may be the Oscar winner among his four most known films, I personally found it to be the most amateurish and disappointing. The film slowly constructs a message that I found to be schizophrenic and quite ambiguous. The journalism here could be described as being ""Jeraldo-like"", a simple hodgepodge that fails to deliver a cohesive or fully coherent message of any kind. In fact, part the film speaks of the constant fear generated via the news media, and yet this very film itself, could in some ways, also be considered more of the same.

At one point the film suddenly displays a couple of ""death by gun"" scenes in rapid succession, for what appears to be shock value alone. I did not appreciate his careless use of such images. On the other hand, The film later uses graphic imagery to great effect, while making a very important point about U.S. Military actions around the world, throughout history, and the ultimate outcome. It's that kind of schizophrenic approach that detracts from the overall impact of the film.

The structure of the film is meandering, and at times I was left wondering, ""what's his point""? The segments with Dick Clark and Charleton Heston seemed contrived. Did you really expect Dick Clark NOT to drive away? Did you really expect Charlton Heston NOT to walk out? The intent of Mr. Moore as interviewer in these scenes seems insincere and scripted to generate the desired (and expected) ""end result"". When interviewing Marilyn Manson, why didn't Mr. Moore ask leading questions regarding the potential harmful effects that his music ""MIGHT"" have on impressionable young minds?

I also found the brief excursions into racism, violence in media (video games and entertainment), and extreme Rock Music (Marilyn Manson) to be ineffective. These are all points that definitely need to be discussed when dealing with the main topic at hand, but in the end, once again, we are left with a very ambiguous stance that detracts greatly from any possible impact. One almost gets the feeling that Moore is actually downplaying the impact of violence in media within a society. A very big mistake!

Mr. Moore speaks loudly of corporate responsibility (with good reason) and yet seems to gloss over the responsibility of artists, who also have a huge impact on our society. It may be true that citizens in other, less ""gun violent"" countries play the same violent video games and watch the same violent movies, but that surely isn't a stamp of approval (or blame-buster) for such violent creations. You simply cannot gloss over such matters by being one sided and asking an inane question like, ""if you're going to blame Marilyn Manson, why not blame bowling too"". I wonder how long it will be before the rest of the world decides to tune-out all of the ultra-violent media we so kindly spread around the world?

I could have also done without the stupid cartoon representing the ""history of America"", and I highly doubt we're going to find the answers to our country's problems by interviewing the creator of South Park.

The heart of the film is basically good. It's the message that's a little too blurry for my tastes. Bowling for Columbine tackles an extremely important topic, but fails to deliver a strike. Recommended viewing, but just don't expect anything on the level of a ""Sicko"" or ""Fahrenheit"".

1836786,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore hit the road of glory with this documentary. He speaks of the High School shooting in Littleton. He is always surprising. We expected an approach that would try to recapture the two young men who went berserk, their backgrounds, their surroundings, their friends and families. In one word try to explain why these two perfectly normal young men could have run into such a pile of guano. But no. Michael Moore attacks somewhere else. He attacks the National Rifle Association all along, and yet he comes to the idea that it does not explain anything because in Canada they probable have even more guns per head. And they do not have a number of killings with fire-arms that could come close to comparing with the US. That's just the point here. The whole film is built on a line that in the end he has to push aside. And he comes up with another completely different and hardly supported in the film: Americans have a problem with their psyche. He does not specify if it is their individual psyches or if it is their collective psyche. And I must say it is kind of disappointing. He brutally interrupts the President of the NRA, Charlton Heston who is speaking of the wide presence of violence in American history (and the ethnicity of that violence) by quoting Germany, Russia, England and Japan as violent countries. But that does not in anyway bring him towards his conclusion. In other words he concludes with an opinion that is not supported by what he has shown in the film. For a documentary it is harsh to say so.

1836787,1,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore is a disgrace to the left-wing society, much like George W. Bush is a disgrace to the right-wing society. ""Bowling For Columbine"" is a film that if it is taken seriously, the results are just laughable. The Columbine shootings weren't based on gun control, and the attackers didn't get their weapons legally either. Moore is just contradicting the second amendment and placing the blame on the firearms business. This isn't a documentary, it's a deceptive, biased, and opinionated hack job of a movie that Moore is shoving right into our faces. Weapons aren't a problem, humanity and lack of responsibility is the problem.

Somebody give Moore a laxative, because he's so full of [sh]it when it comes to his ""documentaries"".",1188172800,11,738,5.049180327868853
1836788,2,B00008DDVU,"I can't see how the anti-gun movement is anything less than yet another radical feminist assault on the alpha male.  I mean, let's face it, women don't own guns, don't use guns, don't want to have anything to do with guns.  This comes in sharp contrast to the relationship men have with guns where firearms are seen as items of recreation, tools of security, a safety insurance for them and their loved ones.  This sense of safety, security, and perhaps even empowerment amongst men is something the feminist movement absolutely WILL NOT tolerate.  Every man must be emasculated because if a feminist were being robbed in her home or on the street and a man (say perhaps a boyfriend, husband, or father) came up and blew the robber away this feminist would have a hard time justifying her crackpot ideology.  And of course the magnum opus of the Flower Power generation was that ideas never need to be justified so long as we feel ""sincerely"" about them.  This has very little to do with guns and everything to do with feminist attempts to correct male behavior.  They'd want to take swords and sheilds away if we had them.

Not suprisingly the already passified and waif Michael Moore had no qualms about reflecting these views in his film which is quite suprising given that Moore himself grew up in Kent, Michigan, a town where street gangs and other scum keep the citizenry in a constant state of fear.  This is hardly anything new for urban America where women can't walk down the street at night, where adults can't even correct wild teenagers in public for fear of being pistol whipped.

Of course Moore presents no solutions to these problems but the idea that the police, given enough time and money, would be able to get things under control is always assumed.  And that's exactly what this boils down to: Moore's and the anti-gun movement's inability to come to terms with the fact that any normal kind of police presence isn't going to be able to control crimes against civilians.

There are restrictions on state power and naturally criminals use that to their advantage.  This is because we live in a free society, well, at least we used to.  People don't want to see a team of cops on every corner, in every building, in every subway car because realistically that is what it would take to get crime under control.  That's what it took in New York but what about the other hundreds of cities that don't have a hundred billion dollar budget and who have citizens that don't want to live in a police state?  Well...

They could look to the Second Amendment but of course Moore has his own twist on that idea, ridiculously trying to cast the Right to Bear Arms as a ""right to overthrow tyranny.""  The thing Moore fails to realize was that the Bill of Rights was written before the French Revolution and before Marxism; back when the idea that a few farmers could topple a central government would've been seen by anyone, especially the elites, as utterly preposterous.  More than likely I would think that the Second Amendment was written with folks on the frontier in mind where having a tomahawk sunk into your skull was far from an uncommon event.  Also this was written at a time when a great deal of the police work (keeping in mind that most folks did not live in cities) and keeping a state of order was done by regular folks.  Defending yourself and your household would have, in most cases, been an entirely personal endeavor.

It's not so much repulsive as it is bizarre watching Michael Moore go to work on these little projects of his.  I mean, in a documentary that is supposed to be about gun control he spends about a half hour on the Oklahoma City Bombing.  What an attack that was carried out with a truck bomb has to do with guns or gun control I'll never know.  Instead it's just a pathetically calculated excuse for Moore to mention that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols happened to be gun owners.  Look, these terrible people owned guns so if you own one you'll be terrible just like them!  Even Hitler had a gun!  You don't want to be Hitler do you?  Endlessly amateurish.  Infinitely infantile.

It's really weird the way Moore is seen by so many millions as the lovable champion of the people.  Sort of like a pretentious and much fatter version of John Candy.  The truth is Michael Moore cares about the average person's problems but only in the same way that every one else in Hollywood cares about the average person which is not so much caring about them as it is wanting to make them ""better.""  Typical Marxist hatred of the Middle Class.  There's no place for this garbage in Middle or Working Class America.

Wouldn't it be better living in a world where instead of finding helpless victims criminals found themselves getting pumped full of lead?  I'll give it 2 stars because it was at least watchable.",1188000000,7,4847,4.60069848661234

1836790,1,B00008DDVU,"I would say before I got involved in firearms, that I really didn't have much of an opinion on gun ownership. I figured what people did was their own business and that it didn't affect me.

As I started reading more into Columbine, I saw Michael Moores documentary called ""Bowling For Columbine"" and I had remembered seeing his film on Flint, Michigan when I was in highschool. I figured the documentary was going to be about Columbine, not about gun culture. Either way, the documentary started off pretty good and I couldn't really tell the direction it was headed. The direction of the film sounded like it was criticizing American culture rather than guns until the film compared us to Canada and the rest of the world how ""similar"" we were. The problem is, Moore makes the assertion that somehow Canada and the rest of the world are safehaven utopias where you can reside with your doors unlocked with a low number of murder statistics. What he fails to mention is the size of our country and many of the issues that are a result of it.

Take in account Canada, a population of 32,984,700 in 2007. The US has a population of 302,213,000. Population wise, we are going to have more homocides. What Moore failed to state was that Canada while they may have gun registration is that before it was ever implented into Canada, the murder rates have been unchanged for the most part and crime has actually increased. Does this signify that guns were never the problem in Canada to begin with? The same applys for the United Kingdom, before handguns were outlawed, the murder rate and gun crime was actually lower than it is now. While the European nations may have supposed ""low"" murder rates, gun ownership rates really have nothing to do with it but rather what fuels violence.

In the US for example, much of our crime is black on black crime, gang warfare, the drug trade, and illegal aliens coming into this country. Actually 20 percent of our prison population are illegal aliens. The folks killing each other are not law abiding gun owners.

Moore also fails to mention how some of the most violent nations are those that actually have some of the most strict gun control laws in effect. Mexico, South Africa, India, Russia all have much higher murder rates than our country yet they have very strict laws pertaining to who can actually have a gun legally.

Overall the movie was nothing more than propaganda meant to look like a sceptical view of gun ownership. I was rather dissapointed with the film. I've watched it 3 different times to try and get an understanding from Michaels point of view but I think that the Bowling For Columbine dvd I purchased on ebay will make better use for skeet shooting.",1186531200,21,2711,4.651356993736952
1836791,5,B00008DDVU,"I recently re-watched this important film that so frightened the perception managers of the gun industry.  This film exposed the mind-set that has created huge revenue streams for gun sales people.  The mind-set is fear.  The same mentality that equates safety with being well-armed is the same mentality that accepts ever larger weapons budgets for the country.  The military industrial complex that we should fear (the one that Eisenhower warned us about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Why-We-Fight/dp/B000FBH3W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Why We Fight</a>) is confiscating more of our tax dollars each year.
As ""Bowling for Columbine"" points out, Columbine High School is located in the same district with a huge Lockheed Martin weapons plant.  It's not hard to imagine where the Columbine killers may have picked up the idea that violence is the way to solve problems.
It's also important to note that this Lockheed Martin plant is located in the district represented by the demagogue, Tom Tancredo.  Tancredo has made a living lashing out at Muslims (threatening to bomb Mecca), and lashing out at immigrants (threatening to round them all up and put them in detention centers).  I don't think he believes his rhetoric, but he does understand that his bigotry serves the business interests of Lockheed, which will make a ton of money off of the hi-tech wall being contructed along the southern border, in addition to making piles of money with new weapons systems that we terrorize the world with.

But let me add that Michael lies routinely -- even under oath. I will start this discussion by arguing that ""oligophrenic"" hardly seems like a strong enough word to describe Michael. Then, I will present evidence that Michael is unable to support his assertions with documentation of any sort. Once we realize that, what do we do? The appropriate thing, in my judgment, is to clarify and correct some of the inaccuracies present in Michael's canards. I say that because to believe that he is the ultimate authority on what's right and what's wrong is to deceive ourselves. Ancient Greek dramatists discerned a peculiar virtue in being tragic. Michael would do well to realize that they never discerned any virtue in being unconscionable.

Michael's rejoinders are like an enormous barbarism-spewing machine. We must begin dismantling that structure. We must put a monkey wrench in its gears. And we must improve the physical and spiritual quality of life for the population at present and for those yet to come, because Michael has a one-track mind. That's clear.

1836836,4,B00008DDVU,"There is much to like AND dislike about this movie.

people often dismiss M/M as a leftist, but I think he strikes a balance in this film as an equal-opportunity critic of both the far left AND the far right (note the discussion with Marilyn Manson about Bill Clinton where they both are quite critical of Mr. Bill).

The sections on Canada and gun control are quite deep in debunking the rationales of causes of violence in America. However, trying to compare violence in different countires and cultures (i.e., comparing America's violent past with the fact that Germany has less violence today but was responsible for the Holocaust) depends on relativity and perspective.

The section on blacks, violence, and the media was dead-on target, with Mike and a white professor walking through South Central Los Angeles without anyone trying to harm them, although it would have been interesting if they had interviewed one of the residents about their opinions of the perceptions of their community. The cartoon on violence and race relations was also thought provoking, if a tad simplified (the 'toon omits the fact that blacks DID rebel against our oppression between the slave rebellions and Rosa Parks, although this is not well known among non-historians).

The Charlton Heston interview was ok, except I did not like the exploitation of the picture of the dead six year old Michigan girl who was killed by gunfire and what Mike does with the picture in this scene. This smacks of opporunitist grandstanding of the worst kind, and I would hate to see the reaction of the child's parents to this!

But that is the only thing I really disliked about the film. That aside, it says a lot of things that really need to be said and provokes a lot of thought.",1182124800,,1755,4.8172757475083055

In one breath Moore says that Americans are afraid of one another and lock their doors every night and behave irrationally, yet in the next he lists crime statistics as being multiple times higher than other countries.  So what is the point?  Americans lock their door because the crime rate is high, it seems like we're actually being intelligent rather than irrational.  The cartoon with the Pilgrams and early America is hilarious and worth the price of admission, but even that winds up being very skewed at the end.  I wish Moore would have tackled the problem of inner cities and the rampant gun problem rather than attack the ""whites"" throughout the entire film.

I am certainly in favor of far stricter regulations and laws regarding gun use, but Moore just seems to touch on way too many points that are disjointed.  At one point he attacks the media for scaring us, yet he is a very member of this media and is basically just a reporter himself.

I had seen this movie when it came out, in San Louis Obispo, by accident.  I thought I'd revisit it and review this movie, that many of my European friends make references too.  I recall vaguely how moved I was when I first viewed it myself in 2002

Okay, while watching this movie, I kept asking myself - What is this movie about?  Columbine high school massacre, American imperialism, gun control, American history, 9/11, Y2K, fear and mass media, Africanised bees, racism, LA riots of 93, life in Canada, low income jobs,  The movie's show of sarcasm can be quite entertaining and can drive the points home very fast, but there is no one unifying theme.

Michael Moor, the director, tends to either make people love him or hate him and his works.  I think it is important not to make the logical fallacy mistake and do a character assassination just because we disagree with one's work or art.  While I appreciate the director's skill at splicing and mixing, I felt that what he offered the viewer was his own prejudices, biases, and counter-propaganda.  As a scientist, I could easily debunk the presentation of # of crimes statistic for various western countries (the presentation did no mention anything about %age or how it relates to total population).  Also the history lesson, was riddled with subjective terse summaries, and selective evidence.  Michael Moore comes across as a liberal, but a caring one, caring for the wellbeing of disadvantaged, disenfranchised, marginalized, poor people of the USA.

While the director does a good job at putting together a collage of thought provoking and entertaining shots, he also presents in a very sly way a contrast, and even hypocritical view that the US society views crimes, and weapons.  At times the movie feels like a propaganda machine.  The director is showing and editing only the clips he wants the viewer to see.  I had a hard time coming up with a theme for the whole movie.  There are quite a lot of themes.  Maybe the one that stood out the most, are the questions -

""Is the US a violent nation?""  and

""Who are the Americans afraid of?""",1170806400,3,2210,4.745406824146982
1836864,4,B00008DDVU,"Film maker Michael Moore is unapologetic about his extremely liberal politics. So what? The question is not whether he is liberal but whether his documentaries and ambush interviews about important social questions--corporate greed in Roger and Me, and truth telling in government in Fahrenheit 911--are true.",1169596800,,309,5.739130434782608

This idiot is a testimate to the kind of overly-free speech that we have to live with today. In other countries you're murdered for renouncing your allegiance to your country's leader, this fat piece of garbage just had to wait 30 or 40 years after Vietnam until he could open his mouth like this and not be put to shame for it. This movie, ok in case you're reading this to see if you SHOULD see it for you haven't seen it yet, is the first of what hopefully will be a short-lived generation of 'reality' movies. Like nearly all, its' politically charged. Violence in high-schools is a horrible reality, I won't give you my view on it but its' a sad thing to live with. The tragedy at Columbine High School obviously came to pass with guns and bombs and what not, however the fat ugly moron that directed this movie wants to point his big fat finger at AMERICAN BIG BUISNESS AND CORPORATIONS FOR FUELING GUN VIOLENCE. What KIND of a retarded loser reaches the age of (well this guy probably walks around with an IPOD and believes hes' 24) whatever age he is and still hangs onto the kind of ideologies and beliefs that you'll hear coming from a roomfull of drunk post-highschool teenagers. Why not say that there were people walking around Moscow in the 80s' with briefcases that could blow up North America if the right orders were given...Michael Moore is a stupid idiot, his allegations and theories in this garbage movie are groundless and ridiculous.

1836868,4,B00008DDVU,"Leave it to Michael Moore to take a tragedy like Columbine and use it for a documental that's informative, provocative, illuminating and, surprisingly, funny. Moore, an NRA member, doesn't offer easy answers, but asks hard questions and that alone makes Bowling for Columbine a very good film.

I always assumed that the big difference between the US and other countries --where furious kids and disgruntled employees don't go on killing rampages--is gun control, but Moore shows that Canada also has a huge amount of guns and people there simply don't go crazy and start shooting one another. I wish he'd delved deeper into this matter (Are the Canadian arms mainly hunting rifles? Is there a difference in the kind of weapons that explain this difference in the amounts of murders?) and into his own NRA membership, but these small flaws aside, I highly recommend seeing Bowling for Columbine.",1167350400,3,895,5.047297297297297
1836869,3,B00008DDVU,"I don't know how this movie won an award for ""Best Documentary"".  It must have been either because few other documentaries were made that year or the academy must be made up of persons who are primarily anti-gun.

This video is okay, but it is not likely to change anyone's mind concerning gun control.  Most of it is uninspired and two-dimensional.  The goal appears to make gun owners out to be violent and dangerous, yet too stupid to know it.  Similar videos could be made by anyone, against anyone, on almost any topic desired.  It is not difficult ostracize an enemy.  Unfortunately it is not hard to find people who will pat you on the back for doing so.  Such action creates pack mentality and relieves us of the burden of having to think for ourselves.

There are, however, some exceptional moments in this film.  I do not like films that stereotype and berate others, but the humor leveled at gun owners works.  It is funny, even if in poor taste.  It reminds me of Jeff Foxworthy's ""red-neck"" comedy.  The difference is that Jeff Foxworthy identifies with red-necks in humorous way.  This film comes across as a more enlightened person, who has risen beyond his roots, poking fun at those who are still ""hicks"".

This film does have one truly inspiring moment.  It is during the last few moments of the film.  After declaring America's moral uprightness, the film juxtaposes the Columbine shooting against America's long list of questionable foreign policy actions.  This segment drops all humor and allows facts and pictures to speak for themselves.  This comes with touching theme music.  Had the majority of the film been left on the director's cutting room floor and this one segment kept as a music video it would have been one of the most powerful segments created.  It is possible that this segment alone accounts for the academy award.",1165881600,2,1854,4.767295597484277
1836870,3,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine wasn't as overtly partisan as I expected it to be, but it definitely had points that Moore wanted to hammer home.  The question he reverted to over and over in the film was, why is there so much gun violence in the US as opposed to other countries, and Canada was used as the main comparison.  He doesn't really want to find out the answer, because he already has his own answer in mind and he constructs the film to fit around this view.  Moore does an excellent job of playing Joe Schlub, walking around and gently prodding people to say what he wants them to say, all the while acting as if he's just Mike from down the street and is curious to find out about gun violence.

He interviews men from the Michigan Militia, James Nichols, and some guys in Oscoda, MI, where one of the Columbine shooters had spent some time.  Of course these guys he interviews aren't exactly the smartest guys he can find, and Nichols comes off as a borderline wacko, but Moore paints them as the stereotypical gun owners.  He devotes a section of the movie to Columbine and we see the distorted and out of context footage of Charleton Heston speaking at an NRA rally.  When talking with Heston at the end of the movie, and at a couple other points, Moore takes care to mention that he is a card carrying member of the NRA, as if to prove to the viewer that he's not only impartial to the gun issue, but so distressed about it that he is more than willing to give the NRA a fair shake.

Halfway through the ""documentary"", there's a five minute cartoon depicting Moore's view of America's love affair with the gun, and his answer to the central question of the movie.  Basically, Moore believes that white people have used the gun primarily to murder minorities and/or steal their land, and this connection between whites, minorities, and guns continues to this day.  Although he never says this, the subcontext of the movie is that whites are the only ones in this country that are concerned about their 2nd Amendment rights, and whites in the suburbs are the vast majority of gun owners (which may be true) and that these whites own guns because they live in a constant state of fear, primarily of black people.  Contrasting this with Canada, he interviews people there who say they have guns, then talks with law enforcement who have a hard time recalling any murders.  One man he speaks to in Windsor says the last gun murder he can remember in Windsor was 15-20 years ago.  He asks a half dozen Canadians if they lock their doors at night, and they answer that they don't, why would they?  One guy admits to someone breaking into his house when he wasn't home, but he shrugs it off by saying the intruder merely took some alcohol and cigarettes.  A woman says that one time she woke up and someone was in the house, but they didn't do anything and took off.  This woman says she still doesn't lock her doors at night, then goes on to say that Americans grab a gun at the first sign of a disagreement, as if that were the natural thing for them to do.  (I have a hard time believing that most Canadians have such a laissez faire attitude about home security.)

Then we have the trip to K-mart HQ with Moore bringing two of the victims of Columbine, one in a wheelchair, where he successfully got K-mart to stop selling handgun ammunition, as if that was the reason behind the shootings.  Moore treats this as if it's going to save countless lives in the future.

Near the end of the movie, Moore explores the shooting of the 6 year old girl in Flint by the 6 year old black boy.  This ends up being blamed on Michigan's welfare-to-work program because the boy's mother is forced to take a bus 40 miles each way from Flint to the Great Lakes Crossing mall in Auburn Hills for work.  Moore states, and I'm paraphrasing, ""She couldn't spend enough time with her children (apparently she had more than one kid) because she had to commute to work eighty miles round trip each day to make pastries for rich people""  At the GLC mall, she worked at Dick Clark's restaurant, so using Michael Moore logic, he knows what he has to do is confront Dick Clark.  Somehow he finds him (I'm assuming in L.A.) sitting in a minivan with a couple of other people getting ready to go somewhere, and he starts asking him about the girl who was shot in Flint, and how the shooter's mother was ""forced"" to work at his restaurant.  How Dick Clark is culpable in this, I'm still trying to figure out.  What Moore never mentions is the fact that when the boy's mother moved her son in with his brother, the brother was a drug dealer, and the boy found one of his guns.

At the end of the movie, Moore gets his interview with Charlton Heston.  I thought Heston conducted himself with much dignity and class, despite apparently being in the early stages of Alzheimers, and considering his company.  Moore asks him if he has guns in the house, Heston responds that he has loaded guns in the house, Moore asks why, and Heston responds because if he needs them they'll be ready, and that it's a right he's choosing to exercise.  Moore asks him if he's ever had his house broken in before and Heston says no. (As if that's enough reason to debunk owning a gun)  At the end of this exchange which Heston finally ends because he can wisely see that he and Moore are at odds with their views, Heston walks out and Moore follows, pulling out a picture of the 6 year old girl that was shot in Flint.  It was quite a display of using someone else's tragedy to further their own agenda.  Pretty sick.  Moore left the picture propped up against Heston's house on his way out.

After seeing this, I could easily understand why the French gave Moore a ten minute standing ovation at one of their film awards ceremonies.  The film depicted gun owning Americans as white, racist, ignorant, mentally deficient yahoos who live in fear, own multiple guns, and will pull them out at the least provocation to ""protect their rights"" from enemies real and perceived.  Not ONCE does Moore talk about guns used by drug dealers, criminals, and other thugs in the commission of crimes.  Nor the high incidence of black-on-black gun violence.  And to think that Moore would actually give time to someone who saved their life or those of others by brandishing a firearm is laughable.  Moore is very good at attempting to give his film some credence by making it appear he's taking an objective look at gun violence, he enables those viewers who don't know much about him and his left wing bent, to easily come around to his viewpoint.  If I didn't know anything about the history of guns, or why the 2nd Amendment is so important, I imagine I could probably be persuaded after watching Bowling to think, hey, this guy's right, why are we so nuts about guns?",1162512000,9,6807,4.474919093851133

1836872,4,B00008DDVU,"I saw the last half hour of this movie on the Bravo network last week when I was actually looking for a rerun of ""Project Runway,"" so my first exposure to it was the segment with K-Mart and the interview with Charlton Heston.

Wow. I ended up being grateful ""Project Runway"" wasn't on. I made sure to catch ""Bowling for Columbine"" when Bravo ran it again, so I could see the whole thing. They showed it again last night.

I have to say here that, prior to this, I'd never seen anything of Michael Moore's (except for one episode of ""TV Nation"") and had never had an interest in seeing any of his films because of all of the negative things I'd heard, including things Moore fans had raved about that I thought were negative, such as the way Moore confronts people in his films.

What surprised me about ""Bowling for Columbine"" was what came across to me as Michael Moore's compassion. I really got the sense that he cared very deeply about people who lost their lives through gun violence as well as about people who lived in unfortunate circumstances. I have much greater respect for him than I had before I saw the film. His motivating factor doesn't seem to me to be so much political as moral. He truly is a moralist. He reminds me of the abolitionists of the nineteenth century that way. (Who an awful lot of people found annoying, if I need remind anyone.) For him, I don't think it's so much ""Corporations and other powerful entities are evil"" as ""People not caring about other people--especially people not caring for those who are less fortunate--results in separation and hostility between people, which leads to evil."" Well, shoot, they preach that in my church every Sunday. And, last time I checked, we weren't socialists.

Also: I had heard, even from Moore fans, that his interview with Charlton Heston was unfortunate and embarrasing. But I don't agree. Why shouldn't he have asked Heston why he did what he did? Why on earth would Heston have gone to Denver and Flint after what happened? I just don't understand it. Some people said Heston was obviously suffering from Alzheimer's and incapable of carrying on the interview. He seemed entirely lucid to me. He was lucid enough to get up and walk away because he didn't want to answer the questions.

Thank you, Michael Moore, for leaving Kayla Rolland's photo behind. Maybe Charlton Heston took it inside. Maybe it made some kind of difference.

1836903,1,B00008DDVU,"Indeed,there is a need for a continuation of regulated gun-control,in America. Yet,Michael Moore uses terrible examples to prove his point and humorously distorts the facts. Moore's end product does not justify the means. Eventhough Moore doesn't use a gun to kill ,he's the very essence of the ""drive-by media"".Why didn't he do a film on pukeheads who recklessly abuse their right to own a gun?-Answer-because that would give honest people the validation to bear arms. The people he points to ,in the film, who have done the shootings,are kids. After years of watching violent images,via videogames,and no parental control led them to that destructive behavior. Not the K-Mart availableness of the rifles and the bullets. The eschatological preachers of the elusive Doomsday,like David Karesch,do have a right to gun-ownership. But not for Holy War,against the American government and Pagan socialists alike. Now,Tim McVeigh's senseless bombing ,had more to do with his anti-social delusions ,rather than his true feelings about legal restrictions on unlimited gun-ownership.(If it wasn't for the song ,""Happiness is a Warm Gun"", John Lennon may not have been shot by the maniacal subliminal Beatle listener,Mark David Chapman.) Charlton Heston supports ownership of hunting rifles,for sport and protection. The surprise Moore attack on Heston,was ridiculous. Like comparing apples to oranges. Moore shows himself as an opportunist,and not a gentleman. Dick Clark owns some music restaurant chain,where a black woman was directed to work at one. How is he to know,about her family members possessing guns or not?She broke the law,and Clark can not be held responsible for her domestic negligence. The careless woman's family promoted an un-healthy atmosphere for their dear children.

Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?

The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!

Throughout the movie it is constantly the gun industry in the US that is beeing blamed for causing the shoot out in Columbine High School. In my opinion you have to look at it in a much broader perspective. Why where the boys that did this horrible act like they where. Was it bad parenting? Was it the School system? Was it movies or videogames? Was it peer presure? I can go on forever... In conclusion, if these boys where determined to get a couple of guns and kill people they could have, legal bought or illegal bought, and it is not only the gun industry's fault

1836909,3,B00008DDVU,"I have left it quite late to watch this movie I know. The documentary is interesting and does raise some interesting points, and Moore should be applauded for that! As a UK citizen (who lived in the US for 2 years) the notion of being able to legally own guns has always seemed to me to be very inexplicable and alien (in that respect I was always totally amazed in the US by the comparatively strict regulation of alcohol sales compared with the relative ease of gun purchase, as surely there is more responsibility involved in killing someone than becoming inebriated?-although of course it is perfectly possible to kill somebody by drink-driving, and if you take into account car-ownership issues in the US this disparity in regulation appears to make more sense). I suppose anyone's reaction to the strangeness or otherwise of gun ownership depends upon your individual social background and this would not appear so strange to someone raised in such a culture. In that it must also be said that within the UK the rate of illegal gun-ownership is currently rising at quite an alarming rate, and this is of course solely confined to the criminal elements within our society who are breaking the law already through their other activities, thus most shootings are related to drug-trafficking and selling etc, exactly what will happen in the UK if such shootings become very regular may be interesting, at present people do not feel overly insecure by being unarmed, however all of that may change in time.

As regards the documentary I was quite astonished that people could blame a sort of obvious target like Marilyn Manson and not gun-manufacturers and suppliers, surely even teenagers are not impressionable enough to be motivated to such horrific actions by a rock-singer (even if he is dressed in such a bizzarre fashion)-I think the essential alientation, loneliness and constant stressing of ""individualism"" (which if taken to extremes equates with blatant lack-of-respect for those around you) would be more obvious targets/explanations. People everywhere have to realise than in order to get some sort of idealistic life for themselves they have to sacrifice some of their pleasures for others sometimes for everything to work, society is a cooperative structure that works best when everyone pulls together, if you atomise society to just individuals then they tend to pull apart and in bad situations horrific events occur!

So this may all be to the good for the movie. On the bad side I found it very disjointed, it sort of goes all over the place in a kind of erratic fashion. You get the feeling watching it that the final product has been very heavily edited and that what has been taken out and left on the cutting room floor would make very interesting viewing! Moore also juxtaposes scenes not so much to make an intellectual point as to achieve maximumn emotional impact, in so doing he may move his audience to think this or that is definetely wrong but at the expense of a logical and totally cohesive arguement.

I think there is a place for such documentaries, and this seems (to me anyway) to be the only one of its kind in a sparsely populated marketplace, but you are left with the feeling that it could have been done better and that in some way you are only seeing one-side of a much more complex arguement, that has been reduced to the most simple and most-emotionally charged level to gain the widest audience. In that respect Moore is probably using the same tools of audience manipulation that he himself might claim are being used to galvanize the American population into support/action in the name of various political parties who's policies he would not himself support-perhaps in this he thinks ""if you can't beat the devil join him!"" Net I suppose it might actually be impossible to make a completely objective documentary about this subject, but this brave attempt could have been done better.",1153526400,,3936,4.880418535127055

1836912,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore makes people feel uncomfortable.  In his interviews with different people, the camera lingers, waiting for an additional comment or reaction.  Sometimes, he will follow up with another question to get the speaker to explain what he or she means in more detail.  Nevertheless, you want to laugh at the person being interviewed, but you can't help feeling a little uncomfortable yourself.

Although the focus appears to be gun control, his argument doesn't seem to be focused there.  He looks at other cultures and their gun-death rates, then follows this with looking at how these are different than ours.  His answers highlight that this is not an easy question to answer.  For some reason, we are more violent than similar cultures.

Like most Moore documentaries, the editing can seem a little disjointed.  It gives a slight comic twist to the film, but it also makes you question what got cut out.  Is he taking people out of context?

Even if you don't like Michael Moore or his documentaries, you have to admit that they create discourse.  Further, these are issues that we should be talking about more.  For instance, he mentions that the mother of the six-year-old boy who shot a school-mate was on the welfare-to-work program, which prevented her from being at home.  The link from this program to the child having a gun was tenuous at best.  It is an issue that we should be discussing, but it's place here seemed forced.

Also, Lockheed keeps popping up in the film.  Although the link is not direct or the primary focus, the repeated reference leads the viewer to think that this corporation may take a big share of the blame.  I don't think that it is true, but it is an interesting connection.  I had no idea of Lockheed's connection to the welfare system, though I will probably look into this on my own to affirm for myself.

There are two disks in this special edition.  Unless you are a Michael Moore fan, these probably wouldn't interest you (like the interviews with the director).  However, it would be great if teacher's looked at the Teacher's Guide.  I think it would be good to start discussions at an early age.  Perhaps it would prompt students to look into the issues and check the statistics and facts out for themselves.

I like this documentary because it got me thinking about an issue that we, as a country, need to address.  We have to find an answer for our violence.",1152316800,,2415,4.7040572792362765

What is causing our youth to gun down each other in schools?

Well, if you listen to The long lost member of the Fat Boys and other people like him, the #1 culprit is guns. Oh, and really mean conservatives who have hijacked our culture.

But answer me this, if conservatives are in control of American culture as so many claim, then explain to me why what liberals believe dictates what is politically correct and mainstream, while what conservatives believe is fringe and pushed off to the radio talk-show circuit?

Guns provide a means to death, not a motive; not an inspiration. There are no guns whispering in people's ears telling them to kill. Guns are a MEANS to-not a CAUSE of-killing.

Taking the guns away from law abiding good people while allowing the bad people to keep theirs by obtaining them illegally makes NO sense.

Rich dopes like Moore can afford to say nobody should be able to have guns when he has enough money to hire security and to live in a safe neighborhood with its own police force.

Guns were more easily available 40 years ago, yet there wasn't a school shooting every week. This alone should tell you that guns aren't responsible for our thirst for blood.

I argue there should be MORE guns. We all should be packing. The more of us with guns, the easier to shoot that hamburger out of Mikey Moore's hand.

Remember, Mikey will eat anything.",1149724800,10,1542,4.598540145985401
1836935,3,B00008DDVU,"Gun control is a hot issue in America, and will be for a long time. There is no question that there is a problem with gun violence, and Mr. Moore tackles this issue head on in Bowling.

Does he do it successfully? I don't think so. There are simply too many loose ends and lazy connections that need to be resolved.

For example, in his expose of the the Columbine shootings. He targets Lockheed Martin the major corporation that makes arms for the military (because having military technology is conducive to teeage violence). He interviews Marylin Manson on the social reasons of teenage rage and why they kill (because they feel unnaccepted). He then goes on to take on Kmart for selling bullets (because bullets go into guns). He then takes a grand tour of socialist Canada where no one seems die from gun wounds (because capitalism seems to breed violence).

So in conclusion, we can safely say that teens tend to kill because we have alienated teens, living in a greedy capitalist society, with corporations that make military grade weapons and shop at Kmart. It really is a neat arguement if it works. The problem is, there is no real one cause and no real way of knowing why people go on shooting sprees.

Moreover, Mr. Moore never quite addresses the question of personal responsibility and family supervision. Where are the PARENTS in this movie? Is it possible that a loving mother and father could have saved the day? Nah. Of course not, they are  not in the movie. However, it is possible that Marlyin Manson may have the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

Otherwise, this is a thoroughly engaging and entertaining movie.",1148169600,8,1648,4.724738675958188
1836936,1,B00008DDVU,"I was very, very disappointed with this documentary.  It largely consists of editing tricks (lies) to make its point.  Example:

In one of the Heston speeches, it appears Heston is telling the Columbine mayor ""too bad"" in response to the tragedy.  In reality, if you look carefully, HESTON'S TIE CHANGES COLOR SEVERAL TIMES during the speech.  Hmmm.  Why?  Because Moore is editing together multiple speeches/ random phrases, from many different cities, to give the ILLUSION of a single speech.  Moore is not showing us a real speech.  He's showing us a >fake speech< that he wrote himself & using Heston like a puppet.

Why does Moore have to create fake speeches to make his point?  Why lie?  It makes no sense.",1146528000,59,713,4.801652892561983
1836937,5,B00008DDVU,"This film made some excellent points about guns and violence in America.  I loved the scene where the Lockheed-Martin representative is talking about Columbine and how we need to reduce violence--while standing in front of a Lockheed missile.  I also liked the scene where a seemingly ordinary teenage boy wearing a loose-fitting shirt turns out to be a walking arsenal, with dozens of guns concealed in his pants.  My husband and I were practically rolling on the floor laughing at that one.

Seriously, though, Moore brings across very well how much better our quality of life in the U.S. could be if we rethought our love affair with guns.  Canada has strict laws about registration of guns and the like, and their quality of life is no worse than ours.  What would be so terrible about making sure that lunatics and criminals can't buy guns, and seeing to it that guns used in crimes can be traced?  Although Moore doesn't mention this, I think that gun owners and manufacturers should also be required to pay into a fund that hospitals would use for the enormous health care costs caused by guns.  Gun owners and makers should also pay the cost of the extra policing that guns make necessary.

Moore does tend to fall off the liberal deep end at times.  He makes a big deal of the fact that the mother of the 6-year-old who shot his classmate was in a welfare-to-work program, working two jobs, and had no time to supervise her son.  While this is sad, in my opinion Moore is barking up the wrong tree by blaming welfare-to-work.  The first thing to ask is why a woman with no skills and no husband chose to have a son.  Did her church tell her it was a sin to get an abortion?  If so, it should be her church who supports the two of them, not the taxpayers.

Another question Moore fails to understand is that it's rather odd that this woman works full time but can't afford to pay rent.  I think more welfare is not the answer here.  The sad fact is that no one has ever figured out a way to spend money to relieve poverty without creating dependency; no matter what you do, you end up with a problem worse than the one you started with.  To find the right answer, you need to ask why housing costs are so high in the U.S., and why there is so little low-cost housing near jobs.  After all, the salary this mother was making at the mall would have put her into the middle class in most countries, and the cost of building materials is simply not that different between countries.  Surprisingly, a big part of the answer as I see it is bad zoning and parking laws and overly restrictive building codes in most U.S. cities.  These laws make it difficult and expensive to build housing here, and the housing that does get built is spread out widely, so that it's hard to get around without a car.  For more on this, see Kunstler's book ""The Geography of Nowhere"" and Shoup's ""The High Cost of Free Parking.""

Overall, though, the movie is consistently entertaining.  Watch it even if you don't agree.",1145577600,6,3004,4.45970695970696
1836938,3,B00008DDVU,"Does life have a meaning and a purpose?

If you answer yes, then logic dictates that everything we do in life has meaning and effect and that effect must be either negative or positive. There is no in-between, Marilyn Manson's comments not withstanding.

Our actions, and the actions of those around us, either build us up or tear us down; increase our respect for ourselves and others or reduce that respect; give us hope and a positive outlook or create fear, resentment, and insecurity.

When you're forced to put the influences on our young people into only the columns of good or bad, and not allow yourself to hide behind the ""it doesn't matter"" excuse, the problem begins to emerge. Divorce; consumerism; abortion; violence both real and simulated in the news, TV, sports, movies, and video games. An over-emphasis on competition with other people.

It all adds up. There is no way to legally prove that Marilyn Manson ever caused anyone to act viloently. But would you agree that his influence is never positive? If so, he goes in the bad column and someday he will be forced to answer for the way he used his time and talents in the pursuit of fame and money. I'm glad I'm not him.

Has our society been ""bowling for Columbine""?  You betcha. But guns (an inanimate object) never impact a person's attitude. They are a tool, nothing more. Easy access to guns raises the likelihood of deadly viloence for a person already inclined toward such actions. But guns, in and of themselves, never influence anyone. They don't even fit the category of actions, so we can't put them in either the good or bad column.

Our children are scared, lonely, cynical, insecure, sedentary, overly-competitive, isolated, and screaming for our attention.

We're so busy earning money for a new SUV, getting divorced, terminating pregnancies, consuming alcohol and sleep aids, using the TV as a babysitter, trying to look younger, and buying our kids off with gifts that we've forgot to love our children.

1836939,5,B00008DDVU,"While there have been myriad films made about baseball and boxing, the other great 'B' sport - bowling - has all but been ignored by Hollywood.  Apart from KINGPIN, the ""CITIZEN KANE"" of bowl-a-dramas, the most legendary tales of balls and gutters have proven as elusive as a perfect-fitting pair of time-worn rental shoes on Family Bowling Night...until now.  At first glance, you probably would not take star Michael Moore for a particularly graceful bowler, but it's truly a thing of beauty to watch this man balling the pins.  For Moore, the bowling alley became his Finishing School, for it is there that he learned to master a poise and form that few men of his girth can lay claim to.

  But Moore's is just one of the stories this emotionally honest and heartfelt film has to tell; one of the most amusing and unusual episodes is the tale of Burty Bob, ""the Human Bowling Ball,"" who belied convention by hurtling down an alley like a 200lb. projectile and slamming the pins over with his noggin.  For Burty, cracking his skull open every Friday night was no sacrifice at all, because it ""personalized"" the game for him and ""upped his chances with the ladies.""  By far my favourite segment is the moving tale of Doris Little, a Missouri housewife who nearly lost her husband when he was struck by an errant bowling ball as he waited in line for a bag of Cheeto's at the snack bar.  As husband Danny lies comatose awaiting medical attention in alley #8, Doris picks up a bowling bowl for the first time in her life and, with five consecutive strikes, proceeds to win the championship for her husband's Mmm-mmm Muffins! team.  It's impossible not to become a little misty-eyed when Danny Little miraculously regains consciousness to see Doris and the boys presented with the winning trophy,  though the potent odour of the Cheeto's paramedics had been frantically waving before his nostrils may ultimately have played a greater role in rousing Mr. Little from his coma.

Brimming with honest emotion and resounding with the effervescent echoes of a championship season,  BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE may well be the most inspiring sports movie since the original ROCKY, and you don't even have to rent a pair of shoes to get in the game.",1144886400,4,2235,4.759067357512953

I will probably anger a lot of people from the left, but I must say that you should check the facts before you label Charlton Heston a racist for his comments about ""mixed ethnicity"" being responsible for gun violence in the USA.  About 50% of murders in America are committed by blacks even though they make only about 12% of the total population.  Murder rate among blacks is 7-8 times higher than among whites.  Michael Moore did not include this troublesome information in his movie and in my opinion such an omission disqualifies it as a documentary.",1144713600,14,629,4.589285714285714
1836941,4,B00008DDVU,"I finally saw this because I previewed it for a documentary class I'll be teaching next year.  I'll put it up against a copy of ""Michael and Me"" to see how such things as fact gathering, emotional presentation, etc. all stack up.  Some initial thoughts on this documentary...

Moore does a fine job of fact checking and presentation.  Some will say that this film reaches too far, or that it is all over the place - I mean, after all, the topic goes from the Columbine shootings to gun control to violence in America to 9/11 to CIA coups in other countries to bowling to Marylin Manson and back to Columbine.  It definitely fills up two hours.  That said however, I think in this day and age it is appropriate that Moore's trek through this topic goes this way.  He takes an isolated incident (Columbine) and basically uses it as a case study to make his points about violence in America and the military-industrial complex.  In that regard its very smooth.  It almost seems as if Moore is finding more stuff to expose behind every curtain.  Once we start looking behind these curtains and then connecting the dots, the picture gets big, broad, and long rather quickly.  So to those who deter this film because of its length and because of its depth and breadth of scope, I say ""nuts to you"" - this is how it should be done.

To the (mainly conservative) naysayers who disregard the content of the film... consider this.  The current generation of 30-somethings (which I am a member of) lives on the cusp of a huge revolutionary movement.  Having been born in the 1960s and raised in the 1980s, we saw the roots of neoconservatism really take hold.  Granted they had been there long before we showed up, but in the late 70s and throughout the 80s and 90s there was no denying the general swing toward the hard right, politically and culturally.  Those of us who are aware of this fleecing and of the gradual erosion of civil rights, social responsibility, and just plain common sense are the ones who are (or should be) speaking out.  I have a theory (for lack of a better word) that says my generation is primarily responsible for getting the word out.  Arguably the next two generations are also responsible for the same thing.  The generation after that (what would be my great grandchildren) will take matters into their own hands if things continue their gradual slide downward.  They're the ones that will cary the pitchforks and torches.  Mind you, that is only if things turnaround and change for the better - government actually pays attention to the constitution, the media do a better job of reporting and entertaining, and corporate welfare and corporate-militarism go the way of the steam engine.  If that doesn't happen however, I quote Ferris Bueller - ""I weep for the future"".

What does this have to do with the review of this film?  Moore is getting the word out.  He may not do it in the most mainstream, non-offensive way.  But give the man credit for speaking out and raising awareness.  THAT's the beauty of this film and THATs why it is so important for people to see it.

If its such a great film, why did I give it four stars?  Simply for the very cheesy, very obvious inserted shot at the end of the film where Moore tries to show Charlton Heston the picture of the girl who was shot.  I would bet even money that originally that shot was not in there (a low-perspective shot of Moore holding the photo inserted in a long shot of Heston running off to hide).  I am willing to bet it was inserted to ""Hollywood-ize"" the film, because to make a Hollywood film complete, there can be no unanswered questions (""What was Moore trying to show Heston?  I know he said out loud what it was, but we still didn't see it?  Damn!"").  But if that's the only reason this gets four stars, then don't sweat it.

1836942,1,B00008DDVU,"This film is basically about murder, and an anti-second amendment tone rings throughout.  If people aren't using guns to kill others, they would simply use knives, and as far as accidental shootings go, sure that happens.  It happens just like any accidental deaths, including any negligence.  The answer is not gun control, it is gun education and learning how to properly handle a firearm.  You're never going to get rid of every weapon in the world, weapons were created from people who fear bigger people trying to harm them, weapons act as a deterrent for anyone wanting to harm another.  If everyone carried a gun there would be virtually no crime, yes there would be a few more accidental shootings, but the murder rate would plummett.  The 2nd amendment guarantees us the RIGHT to keep and bear arms and it shall not be infringed.  Gun carry permits arm only to keep track of who has guns should we decide to get rid of them all.  I carry a mini copy of the constitution with me, that's my gun carry permit.  This is little more that left wing propaganda used by Moore to make a meaningless point.  He uses Charlton Heston, trying to make him feel bad because a little girl was murdered by a handgun at school.  As if it were his fault,simply because he is a representitive of the NRA.  This load of garbage is also filled with rednecks who have little education, someone Moore can easily disect and make them look like knuckle dragging morons.

That said, Columbine here is actually very good.  It's funny, sober, and quite thought-provoking (sometimes all at once).  For folks who bash this film, they're probably either 1) folks who've never seen it, or 2) folks who are so rigidly conservative they can't even see that there is a fairer, more middle ground on many issues out there, including gun control.

After hearing it critized vehemently for it's supposed anti-gun stance, I expected a simple minded ""guns are bad, they kill people"" argument from Moore.  Instead of the strident, one note polemic that I had expected, Moore examines the possible causes of gun violence in our country with some depth.  He takes the NRA argument: ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"" to it's next logical step: ""why do people kill people with guns?""

Though I don't buy into many of Moore's arguments (trying to link the Kosovo bombing campaign to Columbine is ridiculous), the movie is entertaining.  The humour is somewhat subdued when compared to Moore's other movies, but that is mostly due to the subject matter.

I expected a documentary of sorts on the Columbine High shooting itself and answers to the question that Newsweek featured on it's cover after events unfolded: Why? I feel that valid points are made in this documentary, for example living in a nation of fear, but I don't agree with everything that Moore put into this film. I personally wasn't too fond of the ""hilarious"" moments, as I felt they took away from the seriousness of the situation, and cartoon tangents a couple of times throughout the film to break up the seriousness was not necessary. Overall, I would have liked (considering the title is Bowling for Columbine) to have had more to do with Columbine and/or school shootings moreso than bashing gun owners/ NRA. However, as I said, valid points were made, and I was disgusted with some of the responses to tragedy that this country has had, the NRA spokesperson showing up in Denver shortly after the massacre, for one. As I have heard from others: Guns don't kill people. People kill people.

But this film certainly makes you rethink your stance on guns in America, as well as any other country.

The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that all Americans have the right to own firearms, and that right shall not be infringed.

America had as many guns before the increase in the crime rate, beginning in the 1960s, as it does today. The reason for the increase in our crime rate is because of the violence that is glorified in our video games. Moore's arguement against this is that Japan has more violent video games than the United States yet their crime rate is lower. But there is another part of the story that Moore does not tell us about. In recent years, many gruesome murders have taken place in Japan, all committed with samurai swords (the weapons used in most of Japan's video games). Don't sacrifice our rights to gun ownership.

1836979,5,B00008DDVU,"Love him or hate him, Michael Moore is what he is--a muckraking gadfly of very liberal political persuasion--and there is nothing that anyone can do about it.  But make no mistake about it: He loves America, and is concerned for it.  His crusading populism dates back to 1989's ROGER AND ME; and his brand of gentile guerilla filmmaking reached a peak in 2002 with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, which won that year's Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.

Here, Moore, who ironically enough is a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association, takes a look at the culture of fear in our country that makes certain people take up guns for whatever reason they deem necessary and use the Second Amendment of the Constitution as their brace.  The title of this film refers to what Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibold were doing on the morning of April 20, 1999 prior to them entering Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado and snuffing out the lives of twelve students and one teacher before turning their guns on themselves.

In this 2-hour expose, and utilizing his trademark brand of dark humor laced with barely contained anger, Moore talks with those who were at the scene of the horrific events at Columbine, as well as former Columbine student and ""South Park"" creator Matt Stone, and shock rocker Marilyn Manson (who was used as a convenient whipping boy because the Columbine shooters were big fans of his), among others, and takes us inside the Michigan militia, whose obsessions with guns attracted Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols (the guys who blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City in April 1995), and talks with an indignant James Nichols (Terry's brother), who just looks and talks like the sort of gun-crazed wacko the media make him out to be.

But Moore, typically, doesn't stop there.  He indicts the American media for putting fear and loathing into people for showing gun crimes done (seemingly) exclusively by gang-bangers who happen to be black; he cites statistics that show that America has a higher murder rate than any ""civilized"" nation in the world; and he shows the social and economic conditions around his own hometown of Flint, Michigan that led to a young little girl named Kayla being accidentally shot by a classmate with a gun he found lying around his mother's home.

And that's still not enough.  For despite being a member of the NRA, he calls to the carpet that very same organization for holding its annual meeting in Denver in 1999, a mere few miles from Columbine, and later in Flint, just weeks after Kayla's death.  And in the end, he asks some very tough questions of actor and former NRA president Charlton Heston about why it is that other countries with proportionally as many guns to people as America have much lower murder rates than we do.  Heston boils it down to our nation having ""a history of violence and blood on its hands"" (no surprise there) and ""mixed ethnicities"" (coming from a man who marched with Martin Luther King in Washington in 1963, that last comment *is* a shock; but given his political turn towards the far right in the 1970s, that too ends up as being less of a shock than it otherwise might be).

Moore doesn't offer any easy answers for why America's obsession with guns is so great, because there just aren't any.  But he does strongly point the finger at our violent past and present, coming right up to and slightly beyond the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and says that this past and our present fears of gangs and terrorists spawning a mindset of packing heat isn't going to make America a safer nation.  This is a totally reasonable conclusion that those who would condemn Moore for this film (and for that matter for FAHRENHEIT 9/11 which, given how *this* film briefly touches on 9/11, they should have seen coming) don't want to come to grips with, probably because it requires them to look in the mirror and see the face they don't really want to see.

BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE categorically does NOT condemn the Second Amendment or the right for people to bear firearms.  Nor does it slander either Heston or the NRA.  It indicts the political, social, and economic culture in America that makes incidents like Columbine and 9/11 not only possible, but inevitable.  And on that note, Moore, with his usual trademark techniques, has more than done his job as a muckraker, a filmmaker, and a true example of American patriotism.",1132531200,5,4408,4.777631578947369
1836980,5,B00008DDVU,"Contrary to popular belief, this film is not about not bowling. Indeed, on the contrary, it is about the greatest bowling competition on Earth. Bobbing For Apples is an autobiography about Morgan Spurlock (portrayed by Michael Moore) during the time in his life he went head-to-head with ex-Minnesota senator Anthony Hopkins in the Masters Bowling Leage Junior Division and came home a champion. You can find poetic reference to this event in Spurlock's two novels ""Twenty-Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Also contrary to popular belief, Morgan Spurlock did not write ""Great Expectations"" because Robert Duvall wrote that book and that was like 500 years ago. And Roger Ebert did not write ""A Christmas Carole"" because Charles Dickens wrote that, though Ebert is a prominent character in the film and portrays himself as Spurlock's coach and mentor. Once again, Anthony Hopkins, since he is directing the movie, has to show like 50 bajillion scenes of himself reading the Canterbury Tales and these parts, in my opinion, gravely endanger the flow of the movie. However, Hopkins saves the film from himself by using his trademark camera angles we first encountered with his work in Deep Blue Sea (Cameron Diaz). Plus, the guy was the first James Bond, I mean how cool is that? I'm of course talking about Roger Ebert and not the Taj Mahol, though there is a king who bowls in the tournament. An excellent film from beginning to end, but what else is to be expected of Morgan Spurlock nowadays (author of the Bearenstein Bears books)?

This movie was about gun control in America and how it related to the Columbine tradgedy and the six year old school shooting in his hometown of Flint, MI.  We all scratch our heads and think ""why?"" when we hear of these terrible things, but he introduces us to these otherwise heavy topics with humor here and there.  The bank where he buys the gun, talking with the members of the Michigan Malicia (home of the Nichols brothers and Timothy McVeigh of the Oklahoma City bombing), asking the salesman of the home security system where exactly the rapist was now, and even Marilyn Manson!  Check out the special features section with the Marilyn Manson video ""Fight Song"" before a football team.  Now that's cool!  It very much as a horror aspect in very direct ways.  There is none of this old school horror / suspense mentality as it's a documentary rather than a movie.  There is no boggie man lurking in the shadows, these boys were real people.  Look at the video footage they took from the security cameras in the cafeteria and library from Columbine - one of them is blowing people away and drinking out of a pop bottle at the same time.

The biggest question we all ask is ""Why?"".  Why did these two boys do what they did?  The answer?  Well, I guess there are no true answers.  Some atest it to the fact that it really REALLY sucks to be a teenager.  And even though I left my teens behind long ago, it really REALLY did suck.  Matt Stone of South Park creation summed it up pretty well when he talked about being tracked since the sixth grade to be in honors math class.  It is drilled into your head that if you don't get certain things in life you'll be a loser and die poor and lonely.  That's certainly not the case, as we would all find out, but it's hard to accept that while you're actually in bonehead math.

I especially liked the scenes where he is chatting with two trashy young men in a bar who blame their hometown for all their problems, only to find out that they are the problem.  They were trash - selling drugs, guns, stolen property, etc.  And the other one said he was angry that he wasn't named as the #1 suspect in the making of an Anarchist Cookbook recipe, but this town was bringing him down so bad.  As we can see, the town is clearly to blame.

That brings us to the state of the union address as his hometown of Flint.  Already depressed and downtroden over the auto industry decline, Flint also became the sight of the youngest school shooting in American history when a six year old boy brought a gun to school and shot a fellow first grader.  And Charlton Heston came to town to represent the NRA immediately following the Columbine as well as Flint tradgedies.  Now that's truly poor taste.  And he walked away from him.  He continued to walk away even when the audience was in tears when he said ""Mr. Heston, this is the girl who was shot in Flint"".  Michael Moore left her picture on his front porch and he too walked away.  Shame on Charlton Heston.  And shame on each and every one of us who is negligent.

Michael Moore's takes on gun control, though, should hit home fairly clearly, even though sometimes he can be somewhat biased as to the message he tries to get across. Nevertheless, it is interesting to notice how blame is shifted from hand to hand, pointing fingers at ""mixed ethnicity"" and Marilyn Manson, and not seeing anyone showing up and doing something about gun control.

An especially heartbreaking (or, at least, thought provoking and emotion stirring) ocasion is the story of the 6 year old girl that gets shot by a classmate and, when brought up to conversation with Mr. Heston, is dismissed as being at all an important event that should drive a more tight control of gun possession.

And pay attention to the clear mind and interesting points made by musician Marilyn Manson, accused of being one of the reasons that led two kids in Colorado to go off in a murderous rampage. Not being a fan of his music I admired what he had to say and how he answered Mr. Moore's questions in a very objective and insightful manner. 5 stars for that.

All in all, Michael Moore addresses the issue of gun control in a thought provoking film that should be seen and analyzed before judging someone for being against or in favour of gun control.",1128038400,3,1364,4.698744769874477

This movie documentary that was written, produced, and directed by Michael Moore (who is a life-time member of the National Rifle Association, NRA) takes a look at violence in general and guns in particular in the United States.  It mixes actual archival news footage, animation, and candid interviews to get its points across.  This is all balanced with Moore's own brand of humor.

The title of this documentary comes from the police investigation that revealed that the two students who were responsible for the Columbine High School killings in April 1999 went bowling before the massacre.

I think the most revealing thing about this documentary is when Moore asks: ""How many people are killed by guns each year?""  He gives the answer by indicating the yearly gun killings for seven specific countries:

(1) Germany: 381

(2) France: 255

(3) Canada: 165

(4) United Kingdom: 68

(5) Australia: 65

(6) Japan: 39

(7) UNITED STATES: 11,127

There are some hilarious scenes in this documentary.  My three favorites are:

(1) When Moore goes to an actual US bank and asks the teller:  ""I want the account where I can get the free gun.""  Once the account is opened, he asks the question that titles this review.

(2) When Moore suggests that there should not only be a TV show called ""Cops"" but there should also be one called ""Corporate Cops.""  He then acts out some exciting scenes from this made-up show.

(3) The animated cartoon called ""A Brief History of America.""

There are also some upsetting scenes.  Two (besides the scenes of what actually happened at Columbine High School) that stood out for me are:

(1) When a six-year old boy stole a gun and killed at his school an innocent six-year old girl (named Kayla).

(2) When we are shown the resultant disabling condition of two students who survived the Columbine massacre.

Who will you hear or see in this documentary??  Some names are:

Michael Moore, Charlton Heston (NRA president and actor), Marilyn Manson, Bill Clinton, Timothy McVeigh (Oklahoma City building bomber), Terry Nichols (Oklahoma City building bombing accomplice), James Nichols (brother of Terry Nichols), George W. Bush, Eric Harris (Columbine murderer), Dylan Klebold (Columbine murderer), Adolf Hitler, Chris Rock, and Dick Clark.

The main problem I had with this documentary is that a few times Moore does not stick with his theme of violence and guns.  For example, take the case of the little boy who shot the little girl.  It turns out that the little boy's mother did not know he took a gun to school because his single mother on welfare was forced to participate in a ""welfare to work"" program.  That is, she was to busy working to look properly after her little boy.  I felt that this particular story should have ended here.

However, Moore then starts interviewing officials involved in the welfare program.  He eventually finds out that the mother had to work at one of Dick Clark's restaurants.  Knowing this, he goes to interview, of all people, Dick Clark.

I felt all of this was unnecessary and somewhat distracting.  Moore does things like this infrequently.

As the many, many reviews below this one attest, you will either dislike (even hate) or like (even love) this movie.  But isn't this a sign of a good movie--to illicit strong emotion?

Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has over ten extras, all of which I found to be interesting and informative.

In conclusion, I urge you to see this movie documentary yourself and discover why it won an Oscar!!

1837004,5,B00008DDVU,"There is little more to be said concerning this controversial and riveting film.  It is a shame that, for some, the personal insults have to let fly but then maybe that is what this film is about - FEAR and the perception of it.

There are roughly twenty times as many murders with handguns on a per capita basis in the United States than in Canada. The thought that arming you makes you safer holds no water. The US has more than three times the rate of robberies with guns than in Canada, on a per capita basis.

There is no doubt that Americans appear to be afraid.  Of what? other Americans?  Why else would so many people have to have so many guns, and not just guns but weapons of mass destruction.  With over 200 million guns held by Americans that means a gun in circulation for 7 out of every 10 men, women and children in the US.

There has been a wrong comparison that US have guns yet other countries use different weapons.

In the UK (2004) using anything from guns to baseball bats there were 853 murders.  In the United States there were 16,110 murders.

Even allowing for a population around 5 times that of the UK the US murder rate is almost 400 percent higher!

As usual Michael Moore makes a thought provoking, soul searching point that something is wrong where a bank is also a licensed arms dealer and hands out free guns with new accounts!  That is insane.

As a final note which is dedicated to West Yorkshire Police Force`s, very brave Pc Sharon Beshenivsky who was shot dead in cold blood by armed robbers in Bradford city, UK on Friday 18th November 2005.  Let us not forget the law enforcers worldwide who everyday are faced with the very real danger of a maniac with a gunwho will pull the trigger without a blink of an eye and particularly the men and women of the UK police forces who step in time after time, armed with little more than courage and a passion to protect us all.

When this happens in the UK the whole nation is shocked and disgusted and we mourn yet more lives shattered by the gun!",1126569600,2,2030,4.347480106100796

His talent and his concern for the less fortunate and vunerable of us shines through, once again, in this film!  Thank God there is a Michael Moore out there doing the brain work most of us can't or won't take the time to contemplate.  My hat is off to this American icon!",1125705600,,431,4.283950617283951
1837006,5,B00008DDVU,"In BFC, Michael Moore does a brilliant job of analyzing why there is so much violence in America, of exploring what that one thing is that separates us from other nations. Is it because of all the violence in our cinema? No - that's everywhere. Rock-n-roll? Everywhere. Kids being relentlessly picked on in school? Happens everywhere. Guns? Canadians possess as many, or more, as Americans, yet gun shootings are rare up there.

What I can't believe is that so many reviewers here have missed the central theme of this documentary...the one thing that separates Americans from Canadians and Europeans is the constant state of fear we are thrown into by the media - a phenomenon missing in other countries. Everything came back to that one conclusion. It was a pretty cut and dry social statement, yet to read other reviews here one would be led to believe the movie was about hating on Charleton Heston or something.

Some people here have claimed that Moore took Heston's from my cold, dead hands line out of context, but he didn't. As it's a common catchphrase of the NRA, I think we all know what it means. You can take his gun when you pry it out of his cold, dead hands...kinda difficult to take that out of context.",1124064000,4,1221,4.648148148148148

This dvd is talking about America has a history of violence our country has the most murder rates then any other conutry around the world. It covers the NRA being told not to come to Lilitan Colorado after the Columbine shooting. Their is also a cartoon explaining America's brief history back in the 17 century. I realy can't believe the Canadian people don't never lock their doors at night or when they leave. Maybe we should go to Canada and break in their houses. Their are some funny silly moments in theis dvd like Michael Moore tring to be a cop arresting a person and eating at the same time. Also some very sad moments like at the elementary school shooting when a little boy shot a little girl.

1837008,1,B00008DDVU,"I don't know why anyone goes to see anything of Michael Moore's.  I learned one interesting thing in this film--that Canadians like their guns just like Americans.  Other than that, this is like every other Michael Moore film--shameless propaganda made to stir the pot for a group that already agrees with him anyway.  Michael Moore is just another loser making a buck by generating controversy.  It's too bad people simply don't ignore this kind of stuff instead of making a big deal about it and generating interest in it.  If you are someone who is passionately anti-gun rights and want to be angered, go waste your money.  If you are pro gun-rights and want to be angered by a one-sided opposing view, go waste your money.  If you are a moderate and want to be bored, go waste your money.

1837009,5,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine tells a story that must be told.

If this is an arguement for gun control laws, I offer these questions.

Why do any laws exist? To protect the rights of individuals?

Why do handguns exist? To protect the rights of the person holding the gun?

What rights do you think you have when someone is pointing a deadly weapon at you?

When a driver possessing a handgun is accidentally forced off the road by an inattentive driver using the cell phone, whose rights need protecting?

At ANY time, when someone thinks he or she is being mistreated, is a deadly weapon a suitable solution.",1118620800,3,603,4.588785046728972
1837010,5,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine was a lot better than I thought it would be.  I knew it would be pro-gun control and anti-NRA, but I did not think it would possess so much depth and explore so many layers of issues and of society.  The documentary was highly thought-provoking and really changed my view of American society and the American media.  Bowling for Columbine also made me cry, which I did not expect.

A full two hours, Bowling is completely mesmerizing from start to finish.  Michael Moore won a well-deserved Oscar for this production.  Moore interviews Columbine survivors, James Nichols (brother of Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols), Marilyn Manson, Charleton Heston, K-Mart representatives, a teacher at a school where a six year-old shot and killed another six year-old, Canadians, a producer of ""Cops,"" and yet manages to weave all of this into a very fascinating, revealing, and disturbing story about guns and violence in America.

One of his most fascinating theories presented here is the media's alleged fear-mongering that terrifies Americans into the false sense of comfort provided by gun ownership.

In a documentary where Marilyn Manson sounds more rational than Charleton Heston, Bowling will cause you to take a hard look at the world around you and yourself.

People, throw away your guns.",1117497600,4,1326,5.158878504672897
1837011,3,B00008DDVU,"When the word documentary comes to mind, most people think of boring. In Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore, the director and writer, proved them wrong.

Michael Moore focuses the film around one major topic: gun control. Why do Americans kill each other more than people in other countries? The film takes us through a detailed journey of interviews with popular celebrities such a Marilyn Manson and Dick Clark. It explains some of the reasons for violence in America and focuses on us as a nation. Moore also drives fear into his viewers through this film. Many people might not know how serious of an issue gun violence really is until they view this film. Yes, you hear it on the news and see it portrayed through television, but do you really know? Watch this film and broaden your views.

This documentary contained very interesting material. Not only was it a drama/documentary, but it was a comedy as well. Comedian Chris Rock inserted his profession into the film very nicely. He could have cleaned his language up a bit, but then again, this was an R rated film. This film contained no real acting roles. But as far as acting goes, the cartoon scene was a riot. Again, comedy plays its part.

Bowling for Columbine is a movie that might not settle right with a lot of viewers. A lot of Moore's conclusions are transparent. I noticed that he will ask someone he is interviewing a question, and then cut them off without letting them answer. He is more demanding than actually asking. That is something I noticed that might get irritating to some viewers. He also could have focused more on the people rather than the guns. People kill people. Guns don't just do it on their own.

Michael Moore's documentary is a movie that is worth seeing whether you are a fan of him or not. It will definitely raise questions and discussion topics. School is a good place to watch this film. He leaves the questions up to the viewers. Watch it, think about it, and then judge it for yourself and see what you come up with.",1114819200,4,2020,4.602777777777778

It's worth watching!!!",1114732800,3,85,6.7272727272727275
1837043,2,B00008DDVU,"This one is better than his recent Bush bashing extravaganza, but Moore still fails to solidify the message here.  He blanketly compares the USA to Canada and several other countries in terms of gun murders.  He never comes right out and blames gun violence on guns, or the media, or anything else for that matter.  It is typical liberal propaganda: ask questions for which you have no answer, demonize some rednecks, some white people, talk about slavery(???), and throw in a hefty dose of guilt, and answer your own question with a bunch of ""maybe it was this,"" or ""perhaps it was this...""

A few years ago my friend and I drove from Baltimore, MD to Littleton, CO and visisted the Columbine community and the high school.  It was interesting to talk to people out there about what had happened.  I think the best part of this documentary is the interview with Marilyn Manson, who by the way is rumored to be a political conservative. Manson points out the two ironic media attacks that the Columbine High School shooting brought about: going after rock music and guns.  Two things which despite Moore's deepest wishes, are simply not to blame for the crime.  Or any other crime for that matter.

I gained a new respect for Moore after watching this film.  He makes some valuable points about how way mass fear has alienated people from each other and from the government in this country.  The sad thing he doesn't realize is that the liberal ideology which he professes, along with the entitlement mentality, is perhaps most responsible for this societal madness that we have seen in recent years.",1112659200,4,1600,4.740072202166065
1837044,2,B00008DDVU,"I've never seen ""Roger and Me"", but I did enjoy Michael Moore on the much too short-lived ""TV Nation"". Unfortunately, in ""Bowling for Columbine"", Moore is at his least profound and intelligible. (Thankfully, he bounces back in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"").

Moore basically begins with a simple question, 'why do so many Americans get shot?' His answer is less simple, and in fact, gets bogged down in pointless tangents and disingenuousness.

For instance, what's the deal with the slavery sequence? Is he saying that Americans shoot other Americans because they're all racist? I don't know. In fact, the entire slavery cartoon sequence is glib and downright insulting.

But that pales compared to the scene where he shows the planes crashing into the World Trade Centre to the tune of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". The scene smacks of a college film student trying to be profound. The key word here is ""trying"": what is Moore trying to say here? What on earth is the correlation between 9/11 and shootings? I don't know, and neither does Moore. But this footage is bound to cause people to pay attention, which makes it a cheap stunt, certainly unworthy of a decent filmmaker like Moore.

And then there's the interview with Charlton Heston, which becomes less amusing when you find out that the man was in the initial stages of Alzheimer's. And then there's the footage of Heston which Moore actually altered to fit his point better.

But even most critics will be impressed when Moore compares the US with Canada. Both countries, he tells us, have lots of guns, and yet many more Americans than Canadians die from shootings. Why? Again, he is being dishonest. In Canada, almost all privately-owned guns are hunting rifles or antiques. We don't have privately-owned handguns or semi-automatics, and we certainly don't carry conceiled weapons. Canada has less poverty and less gangs and organized crime. These aren't contraversial reasons for the difference between shootings, but a more honest filmmaker would have discussed them.

The film has promise because the question is a valid one: why do some many Americans shoot each other? Unfortunately, Moore doesn't address the real reasons: organized crime, the prohibitive drug trade, economic conditions and ghettoization. In other words, you won't find the right answer here.",1110326400,3,2320,5.124338624338624
1837045,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore is a genius. No one can deny that. But the fact that someone could have the willpower to create such a film so controversial and insulting is mind-boggling. The manner in which he conducts this academy award winning documentary is unbelievable. He searches for clever ways to make others look bad and goes right ahead and lashes out at the United States. Something he's clearly not afraid of doing. To embarrass the leader of the NRA to the point of humility and to find the most passionate gun holders and speak to them is bizarre.

The only thing I would say this documentary lacks is objective presentation. Not all the facts are given accurately. At one point in the film, it is given the impression that nearly every Canadian leaves their door unlocked, while the real truth is that out of the 10 doors Moore tested, only six of them were unlocked.

He does much of the same in Fahrenheit 911. This film gives us an outlook on American society that one would not like to believe but is forced to. Possibly the most powerful moment in the film is when we are given the statistics on the number of gun deaths per country a year. It is shocking to see the total in the US. Whether you support his views or not, I think everyone American should see this film.",1108944000,3,1274,4.463519313304721
1837046,5,B00008DDVU,Bowling for Columbine is a great masterpiece.  I was hooked from the second I started it until the end.  Michael Moore has a way with words and a way with filmography that just sucks you in.  I had mostly wanted to see this because of all the buzz and I was happily surprised that it was wonderful.  It not only showed a side of school shootings it also took on guns and gun laws in general.  I was shocked and horrified that one bank actually gave a free gun with their checking account.  I am thankful that was not around where I live as I would be creeped out that some of my neighbors would have a gun!  There is a short little animation that was similar to south park in look and humor.  I did find it funny-yet too similar to some people's lives.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the interviews but especially enjoyed the one with Marilyn Manson; as he is a great person because he is one who is judged on his looks and freakish ways instead of his brain and heart.  All who watch this hating him might come out surprised that he is intelligent and actually had very valid opinions.  There are other interviews and guest spots that I found informational and thought provoking. I enjoyed every minute of this documentary and not one second was dull or boring.,1108166400,,1257,4.351931330472103
1837047,2,B00008DDVU,"I just saw this movie recently, and found it frustrating to watch because so many of Moore's conclusions are transparent.  He has a tendency to ask a completely pejorative question in an interview, and then cut to a new scene without letting his subject answer.  He focuses most of the first half of the movie on Lockheed Martin, a defense contracting company in Colorado, and I don't see the connection between Lockheed and guns in schools.  This movie requires critical analysis on the part of the viewer, because Moore's strategy seems to be to throw every argument (no matter how farfetched) at the viewer and see what sticks.",1107993600,8,630,4.814814814814815
1837048,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" is a riveting and electrifying documentary. Focusing on gun control (although topics also range from American history to violence in the media), it's powerful and often hilarious. Moore makes an engaging on-screen host, and the little vignettes he strings together are often hilarious, such as the history cartoon and the interview with the guy linked to the Oklahoma city bombing. Other scenes are truly powerhouse filmmaking, like the Columbine surveillance footage and the unforgettable showdown with Charlton Heston. The film is weighed down a bit by Moore's tweaking of the truth (like in the staged opening scene and the tricky editing of Heston's NRA speeches) and his occasionally insane arguments (like linking Dick Clarke to a school shooting), but overall, it's memorable and worth seeing.
On DVD, the film is in an aspect ratio of roughly 1.85:1. Being a documentary with much footage taken from news shows, the image quality varies, and is sometimes quite grainy. It looks and sounds as good as it should. Of the abundant extras, the most worthwhile is Moore's fifteen-minute defense of his famous Oscar acceptance speech (""Shame on you, Mr. Bush!""). There is a lot of interview footage with Moore at various film festivals and on various shows to a point at which there's almost too much Moore. A commentary with some of his interns (I listened to a bit of it; not informative, but funny and spontaneous) and a Marilyn Manson music video are also worth noting.",1106611200,3,1514,5.0843373493975905
1837049,3,B00008DDVU,"Did Charlton Heston get blind-sided by Michael Moore?  Yes, but he's definitely old enough and savvy enough to know better.  Did Moore gain entry to the Heston Hollywood mansion using false pretenses?  No, he told the one-time celluloid god of the waters that he was a lifetime, paid-up member of the National Rifle Association, and once inside even showed his membership card.  And, although the average guy in the street might be disarmed by Moore's folksy style and declasse dress code, Heston knew that Moore was a big time media guy (previous film: Roger and Me; book: Stupid White Men).

But Heston never misses a chance to spread the Second Amendment gospel.  He just thought he could handle the situation.  There's no fool like an old fool, they say.  To his credit, when he realized that he had fallen into a trap, he moseyed off, putting one gimpy leg carefully in front of the other as he carried a bent back and a 79-year-old frame off camera.

Well, was this fair?  Indeed, was the entire film fair?  No, of course not.  This is Michael Moore simultaneously making a buck, building a rep, and working a cause.  The cause is something like 11,000 dead-by-gunshot Americans every year (a pretty good cause), and the target is indeed Charlton Heston, long-time spokesman not only for God, but more significantly, the NRA, and of course gun and ammo manufacturers and sellers.  So at least we can say that Michael Moore was after big game.

He mostly bagged them too (and made Dick Clark look heartless), but somehow I didn't gain much satisfaction.  I don't care much for Charlton Heston, either as an actor or a proselytizer, but I am finding, after watching this and Fahrenheit 9/11, that I don't care much for Michael Moore either.  I think all good, right-thinking liberals should continue to play fair even though the opposition might not.  This film preached to the choir and a good time was had by all who agree with Moore's point of view.  The cover on this DVD even quotes Time Magazine as saying the film is ""hilarious.""

Somehow though I don't think those on the right thought it was all that funny.  And I wonder if those in the middle were swayed one way or the other.  It is indeed heartbreaking that kids in this country pick up guns and shoot each other, and the fact that they do it much more often per capita than any other country in the First World does indeed call for an explanation.  Ironically, I think Heston actually had the answer.  This is a violent country with a violent history relative to other industrial nations.  Moore and Heston agreed that our history isn't more violent than, say, Germany's, but they got their ideas confused.  In Germany the violence was by the state and its armies and its police.  We have plenty of that as well of course, but in the US we also have a tradition of the handy six-shooter in the holster for a quick draw and a further tradition of celebrating the rugged individual who stands up against the state and anyone wanting to take his arms away.

Personally I think there's a lot to be said and not said for both sides in this all too American debate.  The Freudian implication that would-be macho guys need guns symbolically to feel like men is very real.  It was no accident that Heston let slip the ""multi-ethnic"" rationale for explaining all those dead by firearms in the USA, a rationale that is usually interpreted to mean fear of a big black dude breaking into one's home.  Or actually that is often a sort of ""make my day"" fantasy indulged in by some randy militia types as they sip a little Jack Daniels on the front porch swing as they fondle their weapon.

Well, what's the answer?  There is no answer.  It is a gradual process from the jungle to civilization, and the US, in this gun-toting regard, is just a little behind the rest of the West.  If Michael Moore wants to focus on some people who really adore their weapons, he should take a trip to Iraq or Afghanistan, or just watch the nightly news.

Still this is worth seeing as a kind of Americana snapshot portfolio.  Marilyn Manson proves a fine foil for Charlton Heston, and the Afro-American elementary school principal can be balanced against the poor little black kid who shot the little white girl, who can be contrasted with the members of the NRA who think the black kid should be tried as an adult, who can be contrasted with the kids at Columbine who were just there when it happened.  And the mentality of Moore and his crew in imagining that they won a ""victory"" against K-Mart when it agreed to take the ammo off it shelves can be contrasted with the young dude who was disappointed that he wasn't named a number one collaborating suspect.  (Actually the ammo sales are small potatoes to K-Mart which has big management and bottom-line problems.)

But see this to study the techniques used by Moore.  Oh, where, oh, where has the concept of objective journalism gone--or did it ever exist in the first place?",1106611200,2,4966,4.597727272727273
1837050,1,B00008DDVU,"I saw this movie in order to understand what the buzz was about and was thoroughly disgusted.  This film is nothing but clever editing with a whole lot of social scapegoating.  It's laughable seeing Michael try to pin the blame possibly on the  Lockhill-Selma plant in town.  As for the reviewer who said that the spokesman was standing right in front of a nuclear warhead, you should check your facts.  It was revealed that the plant in question in town was building rockets to launch T.V. Satellites into space.  Don't take my word for it, check up on the facts.  Moore's butchering of history is itself hysterical in the short animated segment where he tries to portray the country of England that the Puritans fled from as being benevolent and even worse where he portrays the Ku Klux Klan and NRA being the same organization, simply because both come up after the civil war.  Anyone who checks up on history knows that the NRA was founded by former Union officials to improve marksmanship.  Just go read the books Negroes With Guns and Radio-Free Dixie.  If one doesn't know their facts or history, than that's forgiveable, but the fact that this film won so many awards is not forgiveable when you take into account the manipulative editing.  He asks a Michigan Militiaman about why not using non-violent resistance, only to have the guy reply, ""I've never heard about that before"".  Yet you don't actually see Michael Moore on screen at all, so for all you know he could have asked a different question and then insterted himself in the editing room asking the question about non-violent resistance.  The opening scene with him at the bank is so obviously screwy as he asks the worker if it's a little dangerous handing a gun out at a bank, yet cuts it before the worker has a chance to answer.  The splicing together of different segments of different speeches from Charlton Heston using protest footage to hide the switch is also quite useful to sway the gullible non-critical viewer.  Notice how Charlton Heston's tie-color changes at one point even.  Also the point near the end where he shows up the photo of the little girl who was killed.  Moore insisted that he used two cameras (hence the switch in perspectives) yet when the perspective changes you don't see the other cameraman who should be there.  There should be one to the left of Moore and in front of him.  Yet you don't ever see them, which is impossible unless Moore lied and basically used just one cameraman to film two different segments (one before and one after Charlton Heston left) along with two different vocal tracks (one of the reasons for shooting behind Michael Moore is so that you don't see Moore's face and mouth from behind).  Those points are just the tip of the iceberg.  When it comes to statistics, Moore never tells where he got them or mentions the difference in populations between the U.S. and other countries.  Add to that just many editing tricks that are so obvious to anyone that thinks for themself and doesn't just buy into Moore like some dittohead.",1106092800,18,3057,4.706766917293233
1837051,5,B00008DDVU,"Honestly, I saw this movie about 4-5 months ago and thought it was kind of ok/slightly boring.  But after 4-5 months of actually following U.S. politics and policies, I watched this DVD again and I was impressed.

I'm not going to get into any arguments for or against gun control because that's not the (most) important issue in my opinion. The important issue which is shown in this movie (I suggest you read a book or two by Moore and Hegenomy or Survival by Noam Chomsky to really appreciate this documentary) is what is the cause of fear in Americans? Why do we always use minorities, non-Christians, the poor, etc. as the scapegoats for our problems? Why do we beat up on people who can't fight back - while at the same time give huge tax cuts to corporations and the rich.

Of course Moore has a great way of showing emotion and I cried a couple of times while watching the movie.

I won't get into the story, other reviewers can probably do that much better than me. One part which was very important was when Moore plays the song, ""It's a Wonderful World"" and talks about how time after time again the U.S. has overthrown democratically elected leaders and installed dictators or supported dictators financially and with weapons.  He even talks about the Taliban and Saddam!! And this movie was made before we invaded Iraq.

One thing I really like about Moore is that he actually shows the story from the point of view of minorities. Instead of politicians or corporation owners who take pictures with minorities and make sure there is plenty of media to see, Moore actually cares about helping minorities instead of making dumb jokes about them like people do on TV or using them for photo ops.

The welfare to work part of the movie is really good. That's something a normal person like me would never have had the brain power to think of unless someone spells it out. The way Dick Clark does not listen really bugged me. And the part with Charton Heston saying his ""colored people"" remark made me angry.

Finally, Moore is a brave brave man. Going up against the 3 million member strong NRA, unflinchingly talking to the Michigan Militia, arguing with the psycho who showed Moore the gun in his bedroom and walking down South central L.A., Moore has guts.

Moore target in this movie is the gun industry, the NRA, and

people its with a gun.

1837098,4,B00008DDVU,"First of all I would like to correct some of the inaccurate statements some reviewers have made about this movie.  The movie is not about american deaths, what causes the most deaths, which country is the safest to live in, or necessilary pointing blame at certain people or things about gun violence.  The movie focuses on gun access and what areas can our country work on to make sure that gun access and human behavior as it relates to having a gun be better.  The Columbine incident was a sad reminder of how unsafe our country really is when kids can't even go to school without the risk of getting killed.  Moore tries to find out why America is so obsessed with guns, why guns are not that big of a problem in other countries, and are the reasons why people committ such as evil deeds.  One thing I found interesting in this movie is when they discussed a six year old boy shooting a six year girl.  The boy's mother worked two jobs for a total of 80 hours I believe they said and still couldn't pay off her debts.  Moore confronted Dick Clark about it since she worked at his restruant to try and find out why that is.  He didn't put the blame on Mr. Clark, he was just trying to figure out why this woman spent that much time away from her kid and still couldn't make ends meet.  I thought it was strange when Mr. Moore went into a bank to open up a checking account and was given a gun for joining with this bank.  Also, I don't understand why people bash Moore statistics on gun murders in America, b/c think about it, people in this country are getting killed everyday with guns so it's hard to really have the accurate numbers on these types of deaths.  Plus, this movie is 2 years old so of course the numbers will vary.  As much as I dislike Marliyn Mansion, I have to agree with Mr. Moore when he states that you can't blame musicians or video games for human behavior.  People have brains and common sense, but sometimes it is not used.  Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and even though it doesn't really provide an answer for why gun violence is as bad as it is or what can be done to stop it, it does make you think.

Moore, now famous for filming the TWO highest grossing documentaries of all time, raises the question of why America has such a higher murder rate than other countries.  There are countless scenes of hilarity in this film, one of my favorites being the opening scene of the film where Moore finds a bank willing to offer him a free gun with his opening of an account.

1837136,5,B00008DDVU,"Forget Michael Moore's biased views, forget how he conveniently keeps at bay, the `other' point of view, and forget how he wants us to believe only his side of the truth. As a filmmaker, he is a genius. He has a fantastic sense of humor, and knows better than anyone else, the nitty-gritties of how to use satire as a weapon. In fact, he has mastered the delicate art of sarcasm.

A film about violence, `gun-violence' in particular, is not such a difficult thing to make these days, is it? It is not, but Moore's way of looking at violence and his somewhat cheeky way of presenting his views on it though, are anomalous, and Bowling For Columbine is one anomalous documentary.

Bowling For Columbine completely redefines the concept of the ""Candid Camera"" form of entertainment. Catching others unguarded in their gawkiest moments, and laughing at their expense, has always been a rather seedy form of entertainment. But, Moore's way of making fools of the `wiseacres', or simply, the `ill-doers', by making a big fool of himself before them, has found a more thoughtful and productive use for the trash that is affectionately known as ""Candid Camera"".

In the movie, in addition to stating the facts from his sound research-work, Moore does plentiful of `street-work', basically interviewing all kinds of people, from a school drop-out who felt insulted when his name was number-two on the `threat-list' of his school, and not number one, right up to the Hollywood `gun-possession advocating' legend, Charlton Heston, and getting all kinds of answers from them, some funny, some shocking, but all leading to the serious undertone of the movie.

Moore's crazy animation byte on the `History Of America', and his disturbing presentation (amid the paradoxical background of Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful world"") of why he thinks the country has always been unreasonably violent, are hilarious as well as acerbically provocative.

Moore's facts may be `doctored' or questionable. But, his presentation of the supposed facts does make those who support his views, as well as those who think he is a big fat fatuous pig, ponder, talk, and have opinions. If this is so, then his job is probably fulfilled. And, along with making us think, if he makes us laugh and cry, then he is indeed a genius, a well-deserving Oscar-winner.",1100131200,4,2328,4.989690721649485
1837137,1,B00008DDVU,"In the spirit of, ""I'll suffer so you don't have to,"" I decided to rent Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine yesterday.  After the filmmaker's regal reception at the Democratic Party convention, where he was seated next to President Carter, I realized that not bothering to view his works would forever hamper my ability to defeat his positions. What I saw was more horrifying (and boring) than I ever expected.  This movie won countless awards and is loved thousands of people but it amounts to little more than the enactment of one cheap emotional stunt after another.

Moore is the star of the film and we unfortunately are subjected to his lumbering, dour, guilt-racked frame in shot after shot.  He is constantly lead-faced and saddened; appalled and unflinching.  He will go to any length to uncover the truth-provided he doesn't have to deal with clever people who may disagree with him.

Moore's outlook is the embodiment of the Manichean worldview.  There are no grays or even light browns in his work.  He divides society into victims and oppressors and, just as we see every day on the talk shows, he pulls victims out of his hat and films confrontations with their accusers.  The result is a fruitcake drenched in emotional hysteria.

This film is a triumph of emotion over reason.  There are no facts except those that Moore can twist within the confines of his theories.  It is the glorification of the sixties ethos, ""The issue is not the issue.""  What else is there then?  When somebody is shot, it can never be a result of the shooter's emotional state, it must always be the fault of outside nefarious influences.  It was a nearby Lockheed-Martin plant that was to blame or a nearby plutonium plant or the towering shadow of the Air Force Academy.

The real monster ex machina in Bowling for Columbine is not a gun but another mechanism for self-defense known as the United States of America.  Moore regards us as being wholly inferior to other nations.  If only we could be more like Canada then our problems would be solved.  There, life is a socialist paradise.  People don't lock their doors and the criminals who enter only take a couple of things and then merrily go on their way.  The director knows this is the truth not through any statistical analysis but due to his interviews with adults in a Sarnia bar and with some kids outside a Taco Bell.  Why should he have to study the matter when such experts are readily available?  Anyway, Moore regards Ottawa's free health care system as the epitome of heaven on earth;  although he never inquires as to how long they have to wait for their MRIs or how many people there flood the borders whenever they experience a serious health crisis.  Canada's health care system is a joke and only a detached elitist like Michael Moore would be uneducated enough to regard socialism as being anything other than the acrid, gelatinous mess that it is.

Yet, for this viewer, there is nothing as foul and evil about Bowling for Columbine than its incessant race baiting.  A short cartoon tells the history of the United States and we discover that our past is merely one long parade of racism against blacks.  It's all whitey's fault.  There are no individuals on this earth, only varying hues of pigmentation.  One gets the feeling from his films that whenever he runs out of things to say that he decides to foment a race war.  As in Fahrenheit 9/11, his attempts to foster paranoia within the black community will likely never end.  He postulates that white fear is the motivating factor behind gun ownership.  Then he implies that the Second Amendment was written exclusively for the benefit of white men which is a blatant lie.  More canards are offered such as the risible claim that the NRA is the direct descendent of the Ku Klux Klan and that they, like the Klan, were formed to subjugate blacks.  That the first NRA President was a former Union General is an extraneous fact apparently.  Michael Moore is a man incapable of simply responding to what is so he must fabricate events in order to have anything meaningful to say about them.

Personally, I recommend seeing this film because conservatives in this country need to know what we're up against.  On display here is the soul of a truly sick man whom many of the young hail as a conquering hero.  Michael Moore is a racialist in the tradition of the Nazis, the Imperial Japanese, the Klan and the Black Panthers.  Like with many other leftists, racism is at the root of most of what he says.  To Moore, white is synonymous with evil and black is synonymous with good.  Whites fear blacks because we are all cowards; whereas all blacks are brave. Whites flee to the suburbs and hole up with their guns awaiting a siege.  So then what do we make of white people like me who live in the city?  What about all the black Americans who own guns?  Moore must attribute it to our false consciousness I suppose.  This filmmaker has nothing but disdain for his home state of Michigan, nothing but bile for his nation, and nothing but derision for those who share his skin color.  Bowling for Columbine is not a documentary.  It is a profile of an individual's inner-hate projected upon the world around him.",1099785600,28,5227,4.667396061269146

1837182,3,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine is an interesting documentary that attempts to answer questions about the American culture of violence. It won an academy award for its director, Michael Moore. And while it does make you think, it also leaves much open for further debate.

The documentary is subtitled ""are we a bunch of gun nuts or are we just nuts""? It shows how Americans seem to be obsessed with violence and taking revenge on others in a violent manner when we feel we have been wronged. But its attempts to draw connections between different cultural links leaves more questions unanswered than answered. For example, many critics have claimed that the number of guns in America is the reason for the violence. But as the documentary points out, Canada also has a large number of guns and there are not nearly as many deaths attributable to guns in that country. Critics have also tried to blame other things for violence, like specific types of music, video games, etc. But under closer scrutiny, the documentary cannot find any correlation here, either.

Several different celebrities make appearances in this documentary, like Dick Clark, Charlton Heston, and others. One of the documentary's best moments comes when Moore is interviewing rocker Marilyn Manson, a guy who many parents tried to blame for the shooting deaths at Columbine. When asked what he would have done to help stop the kids from committing these violent acts, Manson replies that he wouldn't have done anything- he would have just listened to them, which is obviously something the parents of the kids and other people close to them failed to do.

Overall, this documentary has its moments. Moore presents his take on things, and he adds some elements of humor from time to time. But the documentary doesn't present all sides of the debate and most of the questions it attempts to answer are left wide open to further debate. I like the fact that this documentary makes you think, but I don't think it was quite worthy of an Academy Award.

This is not PBS people, I never saw the interview of a sociologist or psychologist, but Moore did found time to have a moronic conversation with Marilyn Manson (...). Then later in the film he trays to enter his stubborn communist beliefs by almost blaming Dick Clark for the murder of a poor girl by a kid who took a gun to school. In it he argues that because the mother had to leave the child in the home of a family member to go work at a Dick Clark owned restaurant (witch he ridiculously calls ""a restaurant for the rich"" when is obvious that is nothing more than another ordinary dinner in a mall) the child took the gun at this house because the mother wasn't with him, and that is Dick Clark's fault. The reality is that this is again the typical story of another young black woman with a child and no father figure, so all the weight falls on her to raise him, or not be able to. Now, what the hell does Dick Clark's restaurant or any other for that matter have to do with that? He is trying to create the rich vs. poor lets blame the abuse of the rich communist crap (when there is nothing more capitalistic and much more than capitalistic than a communist, but anyhow). This crap comes as no surprise from a fool that in his own website has written in favor of the communist system in Cuba. It seems he only sees abuse and lies when he wants to.

  Then he insinuates that the adults who live in Columbine Colorado are many violent people that pass this violence to their children because many of them work for the U.S.A army in a missile factory. With this argument the policemen are also violent and firemen I suppose like to play with fire. You tell me, yeah let's dismantle the U.S.A army tomorrow because the rest of the world is Disney World.

One more thing; Do these people who ignore Moore in his docs realize thats just what he wants.  Haha.  I can't wait till his new documentary, I believe its called Sicko to come out.  But the thing is, it doesnt look as good as his last two films.",1097366400,3,757,4.253521126760563
1837187,5,B00008DDVU,"The ultimate purpose of this documentary, like many of Michael Moore's documentaries is to make you think.  He asks questions that many people do not want to ask and has the information to back-up his claims.

It is true that sometiems Michael Moore tends to edit his films in such a way that it appears that the information could be misleading.  Yes, he also tends to be one sided, but it is not the point of this review to judge the film based on its accuracy, but rather on how well it was made.

This documentary was made very well.  Every scene was fantastic, and I especially enjoyed the cartoon about the history of America.  Also, it was good to see how people in other countries view the United States.

The film was very well made it caused me to actually want and think about violence, and how violent a country the United States actually is.  The movie was able to make me laugh, cry, be angry, and be somewhat at peace.  All these complicated emootions from just watching a movie.  Above all, this movie made me realize how unique America is.

So if you want to see a movie that will challenge you, see this movie.",1097193600,5,1127,4.396135265700483
1837188,4,B00008DDVU,Bowling for columbine is another proof of micheal moore's talent in filmaking. The film is an interesting and sobering look at gun control and the state of our society. Moore manages to provoke alot of thought throughout the film on the way the United States is as a society and how we love our guns. The film manages to be very interesting and at times funny but it does not stray away from the sobering truth of the chaotic state of gun crime in the US. The film may not be as gripping as other micheal moore films such as Farhenheit 9/11 but it certainly comes close.,1097107200,4,570,4.336448598130841

1837190,1,B00008DDVU,"I just had to watch the movie. ""Had"" is such a strong word; I didn't have too. I suppose, like I don't have to slow and look at a car crash. I was just curious. Now I want the time wasted on this movie returned to me in full. I read L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics but at least I learned some interesting words from it.

The title itself ""Bowling for Columbine"", taken from the two shooters supposedly ""bowling"" before the killing spree with ahem guns (right Michael? Guns?) and oh yeah a tank of propane, some other utensils, is simlpy and factually incorrect. They didn't really go ""Bowling for Columbine"". Ha ha, but how cute. They first did something so innocuous as ""bowl"" then blammo, this permissive society which ALLOWS and GUARANTEES from the FOUNDING FATHERS and the CONSTITUTION the right to keep and bear arms caused these sweet little otherwise innocent little children to destroy, murder and kill. If Moore, or anyone walking away from this movie, actually thinks that these nutcases couldn't have successfully harmed as many if not more people without the use of guns, is truly on crack. To charaterize this show as anything more than a docudrama would give documentaries a bad name.

Oh there are facts in the story. But the items that make you go ""wow"" and ""are you kidding me"" are more than likely wholly made up to make you have an emotional reaction (the effect) instead of for enlightenment (the goal).

But as Moore has shown throughout his career, he cares little about getting facts right in his dramas.

Some of us care little for the taste of Moore's, or anyone elses, lies presented as truth.

I must add, to compare how safe Canada is to the US and make the quantum leap to imply ""golly, I wish the US was more like Canada"" makes me want to urge every US citizen to visit Canada at least once (for an extended period if you can stand it). Then, on returning, ask yourself, do you really want things in the US to be like Canada? If so, move there ... please. Or, barring that, never, ever vote in this country again. You can leave your doors unlocked at night in Canada. Who cares?

Oh also, for my review of this movie for the more gullible among us, the review is criticized by someone from a country where freedom is not really on the march, Viet Nam? Oh my. Gun control really worked in that country didn't it? It allowed such good things to happen to the inhabitants of that country, the epitomy of peace, prosperity and freedom in the world. If you sir are indeed from Viet Nam, then you sir are the moron (or an uneducated peasant working in the fields being watched over by your gun toting military).

Since I'm giving history lessons freely, the ""well regulated militia"" clause refers to every sensible gun owner can own them but are governed by laws regulating them; don't confuse that with the ones that take them away, ok?

Every citizen of the US can become part of a ""militia"" if ever that becomes necessary. But only if you have not allowed the government or some dissengenuous film maker leading us to a point where we give up our rights to keep and bear arms.

That's the brain rot in this movie. Moore represents a control, control, control side. I'll control myself, Moore. You control yourself. Step away from the buffet.",1096934400,13,3263,4.535714285714286
1837191,5,B00008DDVU,"Many folks seem so tied up by this movie, but I think they missed the point.  Moore is an artist, and I say that without revealing whether I agree or disagree with him.  His aim is to stir up thought and promote discourse and judging by the fact that there are an amazing 794 reviews on Amazon for this movie, I suspect he's done a damn fine job.
Watch this movie.  Your brain will get a little exercise and you'll end up engaging in an Olympic-scale debate if you go out for a coffee with friends afterward.
Despite the naysayers, Moore doesn't present only one side.  He lets others speak for themselves and, if they don't come off too well, that's probably because they aren't all that bright. You might just learn a little something by watching this one.  For example, as strange as it sounds, you might find Marilyn Manson and the creators of South Park to be more thoughtful and in touch than Charlton Heston or Dick Clark.  This movie has a way of making you reconsider traditionally accepted mores and behaviour. It offers a different explanation for many of our youth's social ills and it seems to be tapped into their consciousness better than most movies or books.
Whether you agree or not, your brain will get the sort of kickstart not available from most movies and tv... and that's a very good quality in a movie.",1096848000,5,1327,4.508333333333334
1837222,5,B00008DDVU,"You can never fault Michael Moore for keeping his opinions, however imperfect, to himself. In ""Bowling for Columbine,"" he strives mightily to understand the American penchant for guns and violence. That he doesn't succeed terribly well doesn't mean the effort wasn't worth the time or that the questions aren't worth pondering.

Taking his starting point as the deadly shooting spree at Colorado's Columbine high school, Moore takes his best shot at understanding why more Americans are killed each year by gun violence (by far!!) than any other western nation. Moore raises a number of considerations that could account for the lethality of our culture. We are a frontier nation; we have easy access to firearms; we are a culture of hunters; we accept pockets of violence-inducing poverty and despair; we are involved in the manufacturer and export of weapons of hideous destructive power; we are a nation of racial differences. Yet in each case, Moore demonstrates that other western nations share these traits without increasing their gun-related death rates.

The movie is by turns chilling and side-splitting. Watching the casual violence of the Columbine killers (and the real-life fear it evoked) will tighten your stomach like nothing else can. The history of the US as told by the creators of ""South Park"" is hilarious and true in equal measure. Moore's conversations with a victim of Columbine are heart-breaking. An interview with Oklahoma bombing suspect Terry McNichols is both.

As well-crafted and heartfelt as it is, though, ""Bowling for Columbine"" doesn't successfully answer the question of why gun violence is so prevalent in America. But by eliminating some of the stock culprits (rock and roll music, violent video games, etc., etc.) Moore makes reaching for easy answers much more difficult. ""Bowling for Columbine"" is a movie that will stay with you a long time and make you wonder why things are the way they are.",1096848000,3,1937,5.162420382165605
1837223,2,B00008DDVU,"Seriously... people... the purpose of a documentary is to display the facts surrounding a certain period in history or an event or theory.  Some would say to DOCUMENT the event, as a solid and complete explanation of the happenings.  This is NOT a documentary.  Michael Moore does a very good job putting some information together pertaining to gun control/violence in America, however, to take all of the information as the hard truth is just ignorant.

Moore does a VERY good job of editing interviews, voiceovers, thoughts and images to get the effect he wants on his viewers.  Example: Moore is doing a voice over about handguns and how they kill X number of children each year.  He then cuts to a picture of Lockheed-Martin's entry sign with the caption ""Largest weapons manufacturer in America"" or something to that effect.  If I didn't know any better I would think that this specific Lockheed made firearms... not rockets to send TV satallites into orbit!

His interview style rubs me the wrong way as he obviously shows no respect for anyone's opinion but his own (very documentarian of him).  And his misguided non-attempt to figure out why we have so many gun deaths amounts to him sitting there and saying, ""It might be number of guns, but it's not.  It might be the government, but it's not...""  And for those who think his final answer is the media... his own movie states that over a period when homicide rates were falling, media coverage of murder increased by 600%, who didn't murder rates likewise increase?

I respect the movie for being thought provoking and creating intellectual conversation between people, but calling this a documentary is insulting.  I won't go so far as to call this propaganda, but do not watch this movie unless you are either willing to do research on your own, or follow Moore's truth blindly.",1096416000,9,1841,4.82484076433121

Movie:

""Stalking Roger""

Lie: Companies owe people a job

Result: Would have bankrupt General Motors resulting in tens of thousands of workers who would now be unemployed.

""Bowling For Dollars""

Lie: The U.S. is a fearful nation with guns in the hands of too many non-elites (Read: too many blacks and poor whites have access to guns.)

Truth: Read John Lott's ""More Guns, Less Crime""

""Fahrenheit 104.5""

Lies: Ubiquitous (there are no truths in it)

Baghdad Blob's fevered brain now just pumps out any lie it wants, knowing that there are idiot, self-hating, anti-American adolescents who eat this garbage up.

If you want the truth about Moore-on, go to sites like moorewatch.com or moorelies.com and use their links to read the original articles that dispel his ubiquitous myths. He's slick and opaque only if you are under twenty-years of age or have an IQ under 90. In fact, the only reason I won't call his work ""sophomoric agitprop"" is because he never got that far in school. And if you spent five minutes talking to him, you'd realize he's just not that b-r-i-t-e.

Oh yeah!  To kill people!  I suppose there are some that like to shoot at targets, (that look like people) but that cannot be considered to be an assault weapon's primary function.  Just consider the term: ASSAULT WEAPON.  These weapons are extremely hazardous.  They are designed to spew forth massive quantities of bullets in very little time.  They serve absolutley no useful purpose.  And yet it seems that Americans will sacrfice their safety in order to appease their ridiculous gun fetish.  It's futher evidence of the state of un-reality in which most Americans live.

In Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore asks the pertinent question, ""Why do Americans kill each other?""  More specifically, he wants to know why our murder rate is so much higher than that of any other country.  Several theories are considered and rejected until finally, Moore finds an explanation that is not so easily refuted.  Not only are Americans pumped full of fear by the media, they are offered no security, no safety net from their government.  Unemployment may be worse in Canada, but there is little to no homelessness.

I found this argument very convincing.  On the other hand, I think it is only part of the equation.  I think that many Americans have a love affair with violence and with guns in particular.  This idea is also expressed in the film.

Personally, I would say Michael Moore's argument isn't about gun control or even that the NRA is a bad organization.  He consistently states that Canada, Britain, Germany have guns, why don't they have as many ""gun"" murders (keep an eye on this statistic, just because a country doesn't have as many gun murders doesn't mean they don't have other types of murders).  The argument is that the fear driven society leads to bad situations.  Now this is a good argument.

Where he goes wrong is with the media.  He demphasizes the media as the cause in this argument.  He stretches it to be the government and the NRA and the militia, and ...etc.  I believe he left out the media for a good reason, he is making a documentary.  He is one of them, enough said.

For Charlton Heston and his horrible nature in the film.  I have read that Michael Moore didn't ambush the man.  If that is true, then what is it called when you show up at a man's house and ask for an interview the next day.  One, Heston wasn't provided with a list of questions to prepare good answers.  Two, Moore immediately set in on him.  It made me sick to watch him do this to the man.  The whole thing with the picture is just BS to get the people weepy eyed.  He should have been attacking the media and not this old man.  Go around to those people reporting and show them the picture and ask how they can do this with no feeling.

It raised more questions that it answered but helped him overcome his personal fears and presented a difficult topic in an interesting way.  He was able to draw his own conclusions and came away feeling less afraid and more aware of how violence is portrayed in our society.

1837254,4,B00008DDVU,"Produced, written and directed by the inimitable Michael Moore, Bowling For Columbine examines how domestic fears have increased America's obsession with guns and scrutinizes the tragedies that have befallen countless individuals in this country as the result of that obsession. Moore's bravado and showmanship always brings high entertainment value to all of his documentaries, and it is always a pleasure to see him exposing the spinelessness or hypocrisy of some political pawn or coporate underling. It is unfortunate to reflect that despite the noble intentions of the filmmaker, Bowling for Columbine rarely offers definitive answers to the social issues it discusses and often recklessly and foolishly correlates American violence with everything from our nation's foreign policy to killer bees. Nevertheless, the film is undeniably provocative, and never fails to directly confront the forces it opposes. Among the highlights of the movie: a hard hitting interview with NRA president Charlton Heston (in which the Oscar winning actor appears too befuddled and insensitive to effectively discuss the ideals of his organization), an interview with the producer of the television show COPS (who shows no compunction for fostering fear and loathing of minorities because ""violence sells,"") and an encounter with Oklahoma City bombing suspect James Nichols (who encourages people to own guns, but believes that the personal ownership of nuclear weapons should be illegal because ""there are some real sickos out there"").

1837255,5,B00008DDVU,"In Bowling for Columbine, the charming, witty, interesting and at times laugh out loud funny documentary, film maker Michael Moore tackles a tough subject in the world today: Gun Control. As a member of the NRA, Moore does not in any way disapprove of gun-ownership. What Moore does disapprove of is the assualt rifles and high powered pistols that are essentially designed for the killing of not deer, but human beings. Moore asks a question many polititians are afraid to ask: Why are there over ten thousand deaths caused by intentional misuse of guns in the United States, but in Canada, a gun-crazy country, there are less than 100 deaths a year caused by guns? Moore asks Canadians, American citizens, even the leader of the NRA why this is. And by watching this incredible documentary, you will find the answer",1093737600,6,817,4.8428571428571425
1837256,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore is well-known as the left's poster-boy and sharpest rabble-rouser.  As such, people watching the film are likely to make immediate assumptions about the quality and veracity of the film based on their position on the political spectrum.  This is too bad because the film is probably more balanced than most would expect.  In fact, the most interesting aspect of ""Bowling for Columbine"" is Moore's own journey through the material.  His initial, left-wing tendency is to blame the amount of violence (specifically gun violence) in the United States on (1) the number of guns and the ease of acquiring them, and (2) the poverty-racism combo.  In the end, he has dismissed these reasons and others to settle on a more insidious and difficult-to-fix observation: that the U.S. (as a nation, as a people) are overly and inappropriately afraid, and that fear leads them to self-protection in the form of preemptive violence (as a nation attacking other nations and as citizens attacking each other).

That this is a documentary to advance a particular point-of-view is obvious.  However, Moore is generally (and wisely) a non-judgemental interviewer on screen.  Of course, he doesn't need to supply commentary over Charlton Heston's self-righteous indignation that he has every right to hold a pro-gun rally in the same city as the Columbine massacre, a mere 2 weeks later.  Perhaps in the light of fair play, he includes interviews with a number of Michigan militia members who are very forthright and even convincing in their defense of the 2nd ammendment.

It turns out, in the final analysis, that much-maligned shock-rocker Marilyn Manson supplies the kernal of the film, with the most concise and compelling summary of Moore's thesis: that U.S. culture is one of ""fear and consumption - as long as you're afraid, you'll buy stuff.""  In fact, fear is used to sell goods: ""Cut to commercial... buy Colgate or no one will talk to you because your breath smells bad... If you have pimples the girls won't want to f*** you...""  If fear is used effectively to sell toothpaste, it's an indication of how the undercurrent of fear runs through country.  Likewise, as one member of the Michigan militia puts it, ""When someone attacks you, you need to be able to defend yourself in the best manner possible.""  Note that she uses the word ""when"", not ""if"" - for these people it's a foregone conclusion that violence will happen, it's just a matter of time.

However, if Michael Moore is convinced that guns are not the problem, he has not convinced me.  When comparing gun-murder statistics between Canada and the U.S., for example, he points out that per capita, Canadians have as many guns, but the gun murder rate is 1/10.  However, he neglects to point out that guns are used in fewer crimes, for example, because it's hard to sneak into a store or bank concealing the kinds of guns (long-barrel shotguns and rifles) that are common in Canada.  Assault guns and other semi-automatic weapons are outright illegal, and handguns are severely restricted (in some provinces, it's illegal to have them in the home, they must be stored at the gun club).  If you only look at guns that are specifically designed to kill people (as opposed to animals), per capita ownership in the U.S. is much higher than in other Western countries.

There are other sleights-of-hand that Moore uses that harm his thesis by lowering credibility.  For example, he rightfully compares the state-sanctioned destruction of American indiginous peoples with the state-sanctioned destruction of Jews in the Third Reich, but then goes on to imply that NATO's campaign in Kosovo was somehow equivalent (in spirit if not in scale).  He then goes further by speculating that the military violence performed by an army ordered by a commander-in-chief (Clinton, the Bushes) is somehow equivalent to school-age kids murdering classmates.  There is a very distinct difference between military killing and civic killing, which is enshrined in U.S. and international law, not to mention in most of the major religions.

Notwithstanding these objections, Moore is still convincing - it is fear that drives people to barricade themselves into gated communities, join militias, and keep loaded .45 Magnums under their pillows at night.  He is also convincing that the fear is generally unfounded - violent crime in the U.S. is decreasing while reporting of it is way up.  Most importantly, because this is a popular film, the arguments are presented in an entertaining and thought-provoking way, so this film is recommended.

The 2-disc DVD edition contains some interesting extras, but they are mostly more philosophising and political commentary from Moore.  It's a bit self-aggrandising because, ss he himself points out in the introduction to the audio commentary, everything he has to say is in the film and needs no more explanation (he then turns the commentary over to his interns, secretaries, etc. in a wonderfully socialistic gesture).",1093737600,8,5007,5.08058608058608
1837257,2,B00008DDVU,"Nobody questions the fact that Michael Moore is a brilliant and talented filmmaker. He's great at using clever imagery and catchy phrases to ambush his audience emotionally, making his slanted leftist point all the more realistic to the uninformed.

However anyone with even a modest understanding of history, politics and economics can only be confused by his blatant contradictions and outright falsehoods. Make no mistake, Michael Moore is a man with an agenda.

This movie is absolutely riddled with distortions, half-truths, and outright lies. Take for example the whole ""gun in the bank"" scene, where he wants you to believe he was given a gun just for opening a bank account. What Moore doesn't tell you is that it was a CD, requiring a minimun 2,000 dollar deposit to open. He also doesn't tell you that the bank never really just hands the guns to the customers over the counter. There is no possible way  any American bank can hand you a gun for opening any account. He had to go to an independant gun dealer in the area and fill out the appropriate government paperwork (and pay for it, it's not too cheap), wait for the background check, and pick up the rifle awhile later from the same gun dealer. The bank scene is staged to make it appear as if he just opened an account and was immediately handed a deadly weapon. Besides, why would anyone who was intent on getting a gun possibly for malicious purposes put down a 2,000 dollar deposit just to get a $200 single shot hunting rifle or shotgun?

Michael Moore, of course, leaves it up to his legions of easily duped burger flipping young followers to find this out on their own.

As the movie drags on we are treated to example after exhausting example of Moore's tired leftist logic and phony criticisms of ""American Gun Culture""...*dun dun dunnnnnn*! Instead of a careful and even handed view of the more than 90 million American gun owners (yes 90 million, almost 1/3 of the American population owns at least 1 firearm), we are treated to some backwoods moron militiaman as our supposed textbook example of an armed American.

Anyone with any unbiased sense of logic and a mediocre understanding of gun statistics at this point has to be asking themselves why would Mr. Moore pick someone like this to make an example of. Remember folks, 290 million total US population, 90 million (and that's just the one's we know about...) gun ownners. Are we to believe that 90 million people in the US are probably just like the militia moron portrayed, or worse??

Also ask yourself, if there are at least 90 million people in America that own at least one gun, and there are 30-40 thousand firearms related deaths per year in this country, that means your chances of being shot to death in this country are roughly 1 in 8 to 9 thousand.

Why is the self styled ""working class hero"" and college dropout trying so hard to make us all afraid of something that has killed far fewer people than cars, swimming pools, and high fat diets?

I could go on all day about the many, many slanted views and outrageous claims put forth is this piece of propoganda, but there isn't enough time or space to do so. If anyone needs any further proof that Moore is a liar and a fraud, Google is your friend. The collective resources of the internet are more than enough to debunk 95% of the dreck that spews from Moore's gratuitous piehole.

Furthermore, take heed kids. Socialism has been tried all over the world and failed everywhere it's been implemented. If Canada and Europe are so great, why can't they come anywhere near to matching the productivity rates, industriousness, and wealth building power of America and it's free market system? There's probably nothing that Moore is more wrong on than economics. That may be worth keeping in mind when reading his daily website blurbs and more recent books.

  I do not like guns.  Shouldn't we learn to use verbal communication before we pull a gun on someone without reason?  Communication can be very effective.  There are times when I do wish I had a gun to protect myself inside my home, butcalling the police quickly helps too.  I do not get myself in a situation for anger and guns to be needed.  Some people use guns under false pretenses, to steal, to injure a human or animal, someone's pet and sometimes on someone else's property.  People get gun-happy.  They want to use a gun.  They are obsessed. Perhaps a movie excited them.

Michael Moore is the Big Bird of adult Sesame Street analysis - except Sesame Street is more even-handed. I don't own a gun, and don't like them. But this one-sided and misleadingly juxtaposed portrayal hardly helps anyone - except apparently Moore who seems unable to decide which side of the camera he's meant to be on. And that, it seems to me, is the core of the problem. This is less a documentary than a vehicle for Moore's self-important ""spin-doctoring."" One can tell something is amiss when the film gives the impression that the only intelligent people are those on its side. The epiphanic moment though, and the one which has forever diminished Moore for me, was the prolonged and shameful sequence in which he takes advantage of a Charleton Heston who was so obviously already sliding into dementia. There is something glaringly inconsistent about professing one's concern for humanity and then treating another human being in this fashion.",1093046400,11,1031,5.106508875739645

Bowling for Columbine is an EXCELLENT examination of the American gun culture of fear, and how we are in greivous danger of imploding on ourselves and becoming our own worst enemy.  From Moore's trip to a bank where he gets a free gun for opening an account (I am NOT kidding), to his interview with Charleton Heston, Moore isn't afraid to expose the freakishly paranoid nature of our society and how it creates the majority of our crime.

I especially liked his forray into Canada, and the spotlight on our different cultures, which would seem very similar.  Boy, are they not!

Moore also takes on the media, which sensationalizes the fear factors that are so pervasive in our society.  It's a great film to make you re-evaluate how you get your daily dose of news in the world, and I guaruantee that you will never watch a news-broadcast the same way again after viewing this film.

In the beginning, we're shocked to see Moore open a CD in a bank and walk out with a gun. Truth is, there was a background check and a waiting peroid; he couldn't literally walk out with a gun. Later, we see a hateful smear campaign against the NRA and Charlton Heston in particular. Moore shows us the aftermath of the Columbine killings interspersed with a defiant Heston coming to Denver to rub the NRA in Colorado's face. Again, this isn't true. If you look carefully at Heston, you'll see he's wearing different clothes during the same speech. The truth is, the NRA cancelled all of their events in Colorado after Columbine except for the board meeting which they had to hold there due to legal reasons. Furthermore, Heston's speech is actually from a speech he made in Charlotte, NC long after Columbine. Moore goes on to imply that the KKK and the NRA are one in the same. Once again, this isn't true. Both organizations were founded at different times and Charlton Heston was a personal friend of Martin Luther King and played a role in the civil-rights movement. Other lies in this movie are Heston rushing in after the shooting death of a young schoolgirl to hold an NRA rally. Yep, you guessed it, the dates don't coincide. The lies mount and mount so I won't ramble on with all of them but I will point out the end where Moore interviews Heston. If you look carefully at the clock in Heston's house, you'll see that the time-lapse is 20 minutes. The interview itself last somewhere around 5 minutes. So, what did Moore edit and splice together to make Heston sound like a hateful, insensitive man? Too bad Mr. Heston has Alzheimers and can't tell his side of the story. It's also too bad that Moore won such acclaim for this ""documentary."" This isn't a documentary, it's mean-spirited, slanderous, revisionist history.",1092009600,20,1966,4.701449275362319

Predictably enough, Americans attack Moore and claim he's innacurate, that he contradicts himself, that he's bluffing. Sorry to tell you dear ones, the History of the US presented in the movie IS the real thing. Those details you claim he leaves behind are those that your goverment manipulated you into believing.

1837309,4,B00008DDVU,"You can't deny that ""Bowling for Columbine"" is a powerfully done documentary. While everyone has now turned their attention to the controversially loved Fahrenheit 9/11, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is still a worthwhile film by Michael Moore.

 In this film Michael Moore looks at gun control and violence in America and how obsessed with it we are and just how the Media does their job. This documentary is NOT saying that if we had better gun control Columbine wouldn't have happened. Don't get the wrong idea. The film merely examines gun control, the film also is not a one-sided job. In fact, Michael Moore himsel is a membe of he NRA.

 What is nice about this documentary is that unlike Fahrenheit 9/11 Michael Moore doesn't have the answer he's trying to find it. In FH9/11 Michael Moore seems to know everything, but in ""Bowling for Columbine"" he's constantly running around trying to find an answer to the problem rather than presenting us with one. Amazingly enough this works. The documentary soon isn't another factoid but rather an editorial of American culture.

 The film has several powerful points that will stand out in your mind (such as when Moore goes to the K-Mart headquarters with two children shot at Columbine to ""return the merchandise"").

 The problem with the film however is simply that many points it seems as if Moore is talking just to hear himself preach. That and once again we're taken to Flint Michigan. Well, there's nothing wrong with going to Flint, Michigan but Moore is ALWAYS taking us to his hometown. I've nothing against Flint but I'm getting tired of seeing it in every documentary Moore comes up with.

 Ultimately this is a good movie to watch. It really goes when examing gun control in our culture. But the film isn't saying ""If we had bette Gun Control, Columbine wouldn't have happened."" The film is ASKING ""IF we had better gun control, could Columbine have been prevented?""

Although he argues for this it is not the crux of his point but rather the culture of fear in U.S society that is relatively absent in countries like Canada that means that similar numbers of guns  create very disimilar numbers of gun crimes.

I also thought it amusing the number of people who resorted to criticising the man's obesity...I wasn't aware that a persons weight was legitimate reason to denigrate his political and social analytical skills...smacks somewhat of bitterness methinks!",1090972800,10,852,4.7114093959731544
1837313,4,B00008DDVU,"My first meeting with Michael Moore was through this particular movie. It was to be a beginning for a mutual journey - I really like his documentaries because they have a tendency of provoking thoughts and discussion among viewers. Facts are often yielded to Mike's personal opinions and conclusions which decreases accurateness. Hence, the documentary challenges its viewers to critical thinking. Personally I believe, any book, movie or documentary that provokes discussion and debate is worth seeing; this one is no exception.

Actually, I saw the film accidentally in the movies and it was so masterfully made that it immediately captivated my attention. The film is very thought provoking in the sense that it asks several very valid questions about American Gun Culture and then tries to come up with answers.

Dwelling little bit further on facts that the movie presents, one will discover that Mike could have done better job with checking facts. The documentary is also rather heavily edited and some clips are taken out of their respective context. In spite of this, Mike seems to be able to present his case rather validly.

Some of his opponents use these inaccuracies as a way of discrediting the entire documentary. I feel they miss the point. The point is not to be 100% accurate at all times. For example, there is a scene in which Mike receives a gun as a thank you gift from the bank. The point is not how long it took, but are we supposed to receive a gun from the bank when we open an account? Does it really matter if it takes an hour or a day to clear the paperwork? The point is that the bank is giving away guns and is a licensed gun dealership.

Even if you would disagree with Mike, you have to admit that he is a very skilled documentary maker. He knows how to edit, use captivating music and make the documentary a pleasure to watch.

In spite of its many accuracies, it is extremely thought provoking. Something that should be seen in all schools - and then be disuccessed.

The Special DVD package has an extra disc with many interesting Interviews and extra bonus material. The Extra Disc is worth watching (almost 2 hours of video footage) even if you had seen the documentary earlier. The Special Disc sheds additional light to the documentary and reflects points that were omitted from the actual documentary.

1837355,3,B00008DDVU,"Alright... I had to do it... Bowling For Columbine. The Review.

 First of all, I heard nothing but rave reviews for this film from a lot of people out in America, including the Academy Awards (?), so I thought... maybe I should check it out?

 After watching, I can say that I should have referred back to that time when I thought it would be a good idea to watch The English Patient because of the Academy Awards... I was fairly unimpressed. But then again, what can I expect? I've seen Michael Moore's work before and I should KNOW that he's not doing a true documentary, but really, he's trying to write propaganda. OK... Point noted... Propaganda can be interesting... How else could Hitler have enrolled as many youth? In fact, for sheer entertainment value, Bowling For Columbine is pretty entertaining... There are a lot of humorous parts, and as a coherent unit, this movie does ok... It's really too bad that it's so driven by Mr. Moore's views rather than by those pesky FACTS.

 For example, instead of attacking the person who was responsible for allowing a gun to get in the hands of a young child who eventually killed another child, he decided to pick a fight with Dick Clark, because Mr. Clark didn't pay enough money for the mother of said child to be able to afford her rent... Um... Dick Clark? So you're saying that because this child's mother works at a Dick Clark restaurant and doesn't make enough to live on, that's why her kid killed another kid? Sounds like she's in DESPARATE need of an education and a new job... But is that DICK CLARK's FAULT?

 Well, on some very 7 steps to Kevin Bacon logic, yeah, that kind of works... but... The kid wouldn't have a gun if his uncle didn't have possession of it. His Uncle, as I recall, was a convicted felon, which means that just having possession of the gun in the house is against the law, another felony, in fact but... Dick Clark is at fault... Hmmm... THAT MAKES SENSE!

 Another interesting tidbit is that, though Charlton Heston does an interview in this movie, and the interview DOES make him sound like a completely bigotted racist in the context it was used, Mr. Moore also replays a NRA Convention quote from Mr. Heston saying ""from my cold dead hands."" This statement is shocking in the context it's referred to (the NRA Convention soon after Columbine, in Denver), and sounds like possibly the most heartless and poorly thought-out speech ever... It's really too bad that the speech happened in a completely different town at a completely different time... Admittedly, Mr. Heston did well enough putting his foot in his mouth in his interview with Mr. Moore, but if you're going to quote him out of context in another situation, then you might as well ignore the entire interview, as it's edited and possibly out of context as well. It's like taking a video of someone and turning it into a picture... While the video may look perfect, you can always make someone look like an idiot by catching them in a still frame with their eyes closed, mouth open, and head cocked to some strange position...

 As I said before, this is entertaining propaganda. It moves along at a brisk pace, has some humorous parts, and some interesting footage of the Columbine shootings that I had never seen before, but aside from that, I have trouble accepting this as a ""documentary"" because of errors in the facts and extremely edited interviews that appear to take quotes out of context.

 If it weren't humorous at times, this would have gotten a star. I gave it three, because it's considerably more interesting than the Nazi Propaganda efforts, probably because of a much more light-hearted approach. Reefer Madness still enjoys a great number of sales these days, even though anyone who's seen it can only enjoy it for the value of how WRONG it was, so maybe this can compare when it's all said and done...

 If you're interested in a documentary with facts, check the History channel... If you'd like to hear Michael Moore's sometimes humorously portrayed opinion on guns, Republicans and wackos, then you should check this film out... It's sure to impress Me? I'll stick with the history channel.",1090886400,8,4166,4.694101508916324

They give more insight into the man, Michael Moore. In the past, I have always voted against gun control, but this film actually changed my opinion of the subject. What I find as the brilliance of this project is that it deals with a serious subject and does so in a manner that is both humorous and respectful of the matter at hand.

 What I found to be of greatest interest in this DVD pack was the Charlie Rose Interview.

Seeing Moore's work mature to this level is uplifting and encouraging, and we see it develop even further in his ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""

In other words, it entertains as it educates. The accumulation of facts in the film is startling as it is fascinating. The film navigates subplot through subplot with each complimenting the other so in the end, the audience is left stunned and awed in silence to reflect on the powerful message presented in the film.
I think one of the most important messages that this movie contains is the fact that America has fallen into a deep abyss of fear. The government, and especially the Bush administration has done such a great job of scaring the American public, that we're afraid of our next door neighbor.

1837406,2,B00008DDVU,"So many people are tied up in the politics of Michael Moore, they fail to realize that documentary is an art form.  It is an artistic means through which to examine a thesis.  I like Moore's work in general, but find the ""Columbine"" film to be sorely lacking in clarity.  In a nutshell, the film's thesis (assuming it has one) is kind of ""wishy-washy"".  I watched the film once and kept waiting for Mike to ""get to the point"" and found that his gift for sardonically presenting bitter ironies and ""slapping viewers awake"" was wasted on subject matter that is perhaps best left in the perview of Criminologists.  Then, to see if it had any redeeming educational value, I watched it again and drew the same conclusion about the movie.  I was very disappointed.
As I said, I like Moore and I will gladly rethink this review if someone can prove me wrong by telling me in a sentence or two, what *exactly* the thesis is.  Is it a statement on the state of youth of America?  Is it a statement about spoiled rich kids who kill their classmates?  Is it a statement about parents, the educational system...gun control...what...why?  Who is to blame for the terrible events in Columbine?  Alas, the film raises tons of questions, but answers none.
While many people have criticized the film for pushing a political agenda related to gun control, this is perhaps Moore's most objective documentary.  People who see an ""anti-gun agenda"" in this film are just seeing what they want to see based on thier emotions about Moore.
While watching Columbine, I actually got the feeling that Moore himself was uncomfortable with the grayness of the subject matter.  It's almost as if Moore was aware that a strong pro-gun control argument would put him at odds with the constitutional freedoms that he has spent the better moments of his career defending.  As a result, the film tends to branch out into too many areas (such as Militia groups, popular music, popular cultural notions about guns, etc.) leaving the viewer with a general impression that yes, we do live in a ""Gun Culture"" - but knowing this fact may or may not provide any adequate solution to the next Columbine.
The result of the muddled thesis, however, might have given  Moore the appearance of ""neutrality"" that I suppose it takes to win an Oscar.  Or perhaps that was Hollywood's indirect way of acknowledging that he had deserved credit for earlier (and much better) work.  No matter, fans of Mike will acknowledge that he is better as a documentarian when his work puts him at odds with big corporations and big government.  He should stay away from the ""garden-variety"" crime issue.
Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this film is it's break away from the traditional ""Moore style"" which is laced with genuine humor and clever camera-work.  There are a few chuckles when Moore opens an savings account at a Northern Michigan bank and gets a ""free shotgun"" for his patronage, but the film is otherwise humorless.  The camera-work in the film is as sophmoric as any piece on 60 minutes.  Contrast this to Mike's quick-cut camerawork and shocking transitions in Roger and Me!
With regard to Moore's the issue of content, the movie doesn't fare to well either with Mike bouncing footage around from Militia groups to interviews with celebs, and so on.  There seems to be no linearity in his presentation whatsoever.
Moore is definitely out of form on this one.  I would however, give him two stars.  One for a valiant effort to root out the etiology of the Columbine incident. And another for showing enough refrain so as not to make any sweepingly bold and overpowering statements in the foggy area of gun control, in spite of the way in which many people seem to have interpreted Bowling for Columbine.",1090108800,6,3759,4.756548536209553

1837408,1,B00008DDVU,"So far as I can tell, there is not one compelling argument for gun control in this country.  Why do people in America kill each other more than in any other democratic country?  Culture.  Not the availability of guns.  In a culture that glorifies violence, where children are subjected to Classical and Operant conditioning to kill through movies and video games, we can hardly blame the weapons themselves.  What we really need is to curb our apetites for violence and our lack of empathy for our fellow man.

  Jamaica, which has extremely strict gun laws, has roughly the same murder rate (per capita) as Los Angeles.  However, most of their murders are committed with edged weapons instead of firearms.  Why?  Could it be that a culture which devalues human life produces more people with a predisposition to sociopathic behavior?  Could it be that it is not the weapons themselves, but the way we raise our children?  Probably, but it is easier to blame the instrument than to blame ourselves.
  Prohibition did nothing to curtail the use of alcohol.  Drug laws have not taken care of our drug problem.  In fact, one could argue that these laws have actually produced MORE crime by making otherwise law abiding citizens law breakers, and by creating huge crime syndicates dedicated to trafficking in illegal goods, with all of the violence that accompanies such organizations.
  The average gun owner is an law abiding citizen who has gone through the proper channels to buy a gun, and who intends to use it for legal sporting or defensive puposes.  The average criminal has not obtained his/her gun in a legal manner, and doubtless uses it in illegal pursuits.  Turning a blind eye to this and screaming for gun control only takes the emphasis off of where the real problems lie.

  As a gun owner, I am not angry about films such as Moore's.  Nor do I hate the man himself.  I think we are all shocked and appalled by events such as the killings in Columbine.  I sypathize with everyone who wants to put a stop to such events.  I just wish that we could focus on the real problem instead of going after a scapegoat.",1089936000,23,2122,4.677506775067751
1837409,2,B00008DDVU,"I give Moore 2 stars, as opposed to 1, only because I recognize his mastery of the fictional documentary genre.  Some of what he says in this film are outright lies; for instance, the Lockheed weapons factory he visits in Colorado makes satellite missiles, not arms to be used to blow up our ""innocent"" enemies, as Moore would have us believe.  Still, his greatest gift -- if one can call it that -- is his ability to frame a story in such a way as to create a deliberately false impression without having to tell any actual lies.  A perfect example of this is the ""What a Wonderful World"" sequence in which Moore castigates America for all of the horrible, international atrocities it has committed in the last half century, while conveniently omitting the type of information that might give a more realistic account of these supposedly heinous incidents.

Moore's depictions of Canada, Charlton Heston, and the NRA are likewise misleading.  Our neighbors to the North are living in a virtual crime-less utopia, if one is to buy into the claims of this film.  However, there is evidence to suggest that violent crime is actually on the rise in many areas of Canada, but I suppose it's silly of me to expect facts like this to show up in a ""documentary.""  The portrayal of Heston, on the other hand, is damn near libelous.  Yes, Heston held an NRA meeting in Colorado soon after the Columbine tragedy.  What Moore fails to inform his viewers is that this meeting had been scheduled years in advance, long before the school shooting, and that the official part of the meeting could not be cancelled due to the NRA's own by-laws.  Most of the events that had been planned in connection with this meeting were, in fact, cancelled.  Though Heston did speak at the one event that wasn't cancelled, he did not utter his famous ""from my cold dead hands"" remark in this speech, but instead delivered that gem in a speech a year later.  Moore creates the phony impression that Heston callously said this at the Colorado meeting right after the Columbine tragedy, thus revealing Heston's cold indifference to the suffering that had occurred.  As I said before, I guess I shouldn't expect the facts to get in the way of a good story, or precious propaganda for that matter.

Moore's contention that the media spend a great deal of their time drumming up irrational fear is actually on target; not realizing the value of a consistent theme, though, Moore obsessively harps on American violence so much that a thoughtful viewer is likely to wonder if perhaps some of the fear being drummed up by the media isn't that irrational after all.  In the end, however, the main lessons are clear: Canada is heaven, America is hell, and Charlton Heston is Satan.",1089849600,18,2741,4.705020920502092
1837410,5,B00008DDVU,"BFC is probably the most important documentary about American mentality ever made. What Mike points out, in among all his questions, is that a population in this much fear SHOULD NOT HAVE SO MANY GUNS LYING AROUND nor should it be so dependent on a Military Industrial Complex that creates that fear. This is never as clear as to when you get a quick history of the USA abroad which shows this military industrial complex in action, including CIA funding for the mujahideen soldiers in Afghanistan, to fight the Soviets, only to end up a few years later with the Mujahideen turning into the Taliban and Al-Qaeda which finishes with a shot of the second jet smashing into the twin towers. Mike is an extremely powerful filmmaker, there is no doubt about that.

He cuts history together amazingly - the historical film montages, of which there are several in this documentary, are mostly just news images cut together letting you make up your own mind - can anyone here agree with these acts of mass genocide?
Having spent time working as a media editor I can say that the BFC is cut no more than other primetime television news shows (some critics have created great big EDL lists of what Mike has edited which shows they do not understand the process of media production nor that this is indeed probably more tight than most other documentaries - National Geographic is mostly STORYBORDED and the top American news channels are mostly biased). If you want to see a documentary that is truly manipulated and cut to ribbons then why not watch some old CNN/FOX NEWS 1991 Iraq war news stories (or even the current ones!) or tune into some commission hearing and you will see how the politicians and military leaders can manage to excuse themselves for all kinds of horror shows. AND THEY ARE!

BFC starts with Mike in a bank, opening up an account and then getting his free riffle with it while asking the question ""Do you not think it is a little dangerous giving out guns in a bank?"" which sets the whole tone for what is to come. Mike takes us to Militia meetings where we see civilians with big assault weapons training in the open to learn how to protect their family, but then he shows us the other side of militia groups with the likes of McVay and Nichols and the Oklahoma bombing (Mike shows us an amazing interview he has with the brother of Nichols who cocks a loaded gun to his head). Then it is off to Oscoda where young dropouts are interviewed and tell us the tale about their violent past and what they know about the Columbine School Massacre to set the scene. Then we go visit Littleton's Lockheed Martin, the worlds largest weapons manufacturer. The real prime moment of this documentary follows, with security video tapes and the police audio of what happened in Columbine (you see Eric and Dylan taking shots at people and trying to burn down the school). As soon as this is over Mike hits controversy by showing the leader of the National Riffle Association, Charlton Heston, holding a massive rally just after the Columbine shooting. The editing here is blowing so many rightwing minds because it is just so DAMN WELL DONE.
Mike then gives us statistics on gun deaths and asks the question -why is it that if other countries have the same amount of gun ownership we do, the same amount of violent movies that we do, play the same video games that we do, have just a violent pass (if not more so) that we do - that they kill 90% less people with guns that we do?
Mike shows us that the American news media is in a fear feeding frenzy. Shows about FEAR sell. Other nations simply do not have so much FEAR being dished out in the news. Mike believes, correctly, that mass conditioning of FEAR has lead to this American suicidal/homicidal nature and so he does a great interview in South-Central LA with the writer of ""The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong Things"", Barry Glassner. Eventually Mike ends up in the office of the producer of COPS to ask if they can do anything to tone down the fear - especially fear of ethnic minorities and for some reason you can see that the producer of this show knows damn well how it is distressing people. Mike suggests chasing down corporate crooks instead (he did this during his show TV NATION).
Mike finishes the documentary by visiting Canada to do an analysis of why they don't have as many gun deaths. Then we learn about Kayla Rolland who was shot by another 6 year old in her class in Mike's home of Michigan. Mike discovers that the mother of the young shooter had been recently evicted and was working away from home because of the government sponsored - Welfare to Work program that sends single black parents, 30km out of town everyday to earn $5.50 an hour. The NRA and Mr. Heston turned up in town shortly after this shooting.

So Mike is fed up with all of this ""NEEDLESS DEATH"" and heads down to Kmart with a bunch of kids that where shot up with Kmart handgun bullets during the Columbine massacre and asks Kmart to stop stocking these bullets. After this success Mike decides to visit Charlton Heston to ask him why he just turns up at NRA events after a kid has been murdered by a gun, again. He then asks him why there is so much violence in America. When you realize that Charlton has no clue and his answer is - ""It's because of mixed ethnicity"", then it all sinks in home that you have learned more today than this confused old man who represents a disturbing stupid mentality among SOME Americans than is leading to death and destruction, period.",1089849600,6,5547,4.528414755732801

The ultimate hypocracy of many of these reviews is appalling.

1837412,5,B00008DDVU,"Funny -- the people who seem to think this movie was about gun control must not have even seen it. Making the point that Canada has as many guns as we do, Michael Moore concedes that they do not have the crime level that we do. The reason we do, he points out, is the focus this country has on power, dominance, and violence -- through our media, our methods of crime control, and our interactions with the world. None of it is effective, and all of it creates more harm than it heals. It is the American focus on the power of violence that is at the roots of our dilemma -- that, and a history of power and control and manipulation of our children that Moore is either not aware of or does not go into. That's okay. His body of work involves more investigative reporting than I have seen in my lifetime. It was the mainstream media that immediately began talking about gun control in the wake of Columbine, smacking of the Hegelian dialectic. No mass media outlet started talking about controlling their own violent imagery. Let me quickly state that Michael Moore is not advocating censorship -- for an investigative journalist, that would be foolish. What he is advocating is responsible journalism -- something that seems to have gone the way of the dinosaur -- until one considers Jon Stewart. Maybe they should get together and create their own news channel. It would be one place you could get the truth and be able to make informed decisions, instead of wanting to take a shower after each barrage of mass manipulation.",1089763200,9,1527,4.556363636363637
1837433,4,B00008DDVU,"Years from now, Michael Moore will be remembered as the filmmaker who expanded the potential a non-fiction film has to impact the cultural dialogue on certain issues. With roots in more traditional forms of documentary filmmaking (the brilliant Roger and Me), Moore jacks up his propaganda-laced form of debate in this criticism of the American gun culture.
From K-Mart to Dick Clark, from South Park to Marilyn Manson, anyone even remotely associated gun violence can expect a visit from the stalking Michael Moore and his camera crew. He uses his interpretations of events and anecdotal evidence to help support his positions that target (pun intended) gun owners, manufacturers and distributors, positions that largely absolve the entertainment industry (the Marilyn Manson connection to Columbine).
This film could have easily been titled ""Heston and Me"", as much of the drama pushing the film deals with Moore's desire to interview the NRA figure-head. Unlike Roger and Me, however, this film branches off in all directions and could have benefited from a more focused editing (we really don't need all the stuff in there about health care and tax cuts). He jumps from issue to issue, causing most people to be unsure of the most important point this film offers.
Even Moore supporters have a hard time suggesting he remains faithful to the truth in this film. Rather than documenting life and allowing that footage to build to a certain conclusion, Moore works backward. He begins with a premise and then sculpts and alters reality to fit his beliefs. Investigations made by watchdog groups suggest some of his strongest scenes were scripted or edited in a way to change what really happened. That would be like finding out the birds in ""Winged Migration"" were filmed in a studio, with the locations added via blue-screen technology.
There is nothing inherently wrong with this form of argument (it is used by politicians, pundits and lawyers every day), but it does prevent this film from truly being a documentary. He has in fact created a new genre of film similar to a persuasive essay or Op-Ed piece. With that said, I hope people go into this film understanding it is not responsible journalism, nor is it meant to be. Moore uses his talents as a filmmaker to try to convince the world he is right on gun issues. Hopefully, his work will inspire others to create more films that tackle certain hot issues. At the very least, he is adding very entertaining (if not wholly credible) films into the American collective experience and forcing everyone to think about larger issues.",1089763200,3,2589,4.981524249422633
1837434,5,B00008DDVU,"Why is the rate of violent crime in America exponentially higher than in other developed countries?  Why are Americans so afraid of their neighbors?  Why, in places like Columbine, are children shooting each other?
This movie goes beyond Columbine to look at the larger question of the culture of violence in America, where it might come from, how it affects our lives, and what we might do about it.
Moore raises more questions than he provides definitive answers.  But in a manner that is alternately comical and deadly serious, he explores an issue that is critical to the way we live and the type of society our children will grow up in.
An important film to watch.",1089676800,5,669,4.700854700854701
1837435,4,B00008DDVU,"Well isn't it pretty obvious that Michael Moore knows what he is doing? I mean you have the controversy of Fahrenheight 9/11, the Oscar speech, etc...and he's even on Time magazine. The man knows how to stir controversy...and win it. This in case, meet his entrance into the main stage. With Roger and Me, he made his big shot name, then came 'Bowling for Columbine', the Oscar winning documentary about the NRA and violence in America.
Not that I would agree on every point that Moore always makes, this film seems to be the one I'd agree with most. I've always felt the rising violence in our country is a mystery and he seems to be the Sherlock Holmes to investigate this. In thew film he traverses around the nation and even embarks outside, to Canada! There he meets people and we realize our situation is not that different than theirs, just the degree of intensity.
The only problem to the entire documentary is that we are never really given the solid answer that we all look for in the film. But, in a way, that's fine. Why should we? Not one man should have the answer to all questions. In fact, I think it's fine enough that people will watch this and think...mainly that's Moore's objective.
'Bowling for Columbine' is another copy and paste here and there, to understand the wear and tear of a certain subject. I don't see it too bad as say his recent film, '9/11', but it's quite apparent here. Oddly enough, I still agree with many points made.
Throwing comedy to such a disturbing event is a hook. Just like writing music or a song, Moore composes a film that keeps you enticed...and you really enjoy it. Here I'm glad with the product. Can you name a film that's really made change, other than possibly 'JFK'? K-Mart stopped selling ammunition, can anyone disagree that this is a bad thing? I'd like to think not.
Anyway, I enjoyed this and it's not that you agree or disagree, it's that you did.

1837436,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore is very effective at mixing polemics with facts, but in the process he often contradicts himself.  While this movie is ostensibly about the Columbine shootings, it evolves into an attack against the weapons manufacturing industry, K-Mart and the National Rifle Association, as those most responsible for the widespread proliferation of firearms and ammunition in America.  But, as Moore points out, Canada has easy access to many of the same weapons, yet does not have such a violent culture, noting that less than 200 persons are killed by firearms each year, as opposed to 11,000 in America.  So, it would seem the old adage, ""guns don't kill people, people kill people,"" would aptly apply to this movie.
The violent nature of Americans is one that has befuddled sociologists and psychologists for decades.  As Moore points out, American history is no more violent than is German, French or British history, yet these countries have a much lower murder rate than the US.  Moore gets nearer his target when he illustrates that the ""fear factor"" seems to be the underlying factor, with commercial and political interests using it to get Americans to buy into the gun and security industry that has become such a pervasive part of our society.  He contrasts this with Canada, where even in Windsor, across the river from Detroit, many Canadians don't lock their doors at night.  For whatever reason, Americans seem to have had it inculcated into their heads that someone is out there to get them and that they better have a deadbolt lock and a gun on their bedside table.
Eventually, he circled back to the shootings at Columbine, even showing the eerie sequence of events on school cameras. The kids who shot up the school were classic loners, who used guns to vent their frustration on the school, weeks before graduation.  What galled Moore and most parents of the school kids at Columbine was that Charleton Heston pitched up in Denver within a week to promote the NRA.  He did the same in Flint following the tragic shooting of a 6-year girl by a 6 year-old boy. While Moore never gets behind the reasons, he does corner Heston for an interview at film's end.
But, it is his assault on K-Mart that yields the best rewards.  He showed up at the national center with two of the boys who survived the shootings and demanded that K-Mart stop its sale of 9 mm bullets, which were used in the Columbine shootings.  Much to his surprise and that of the media that had gathered to film the standoff, K-Mart agreed not only to stop selling 9 mm bullets but to phase out the sale of all ammunition in 90 days.  Moore showed once again that you can stand up to the big boys and fight for what is right and win.
Unfortunately, his polemical stance often clouds this work as he vents his frustration with Clinton and Bush for not dealing with the issue of gun control like he thinks they should.  He used Kosovo to highlight the indifference Moore perceived, by noting that a major bombing campaign occured the same day as the Columbine shootings.",1089504000,8,3052,4.725047080979285

The worst part of this movie is that people with above average intelligence are sucked into believing what they are told in the movie.  I think that the man would have better luck in politics as he is very good at spreading his ignorance.  Every bit of the way through this movie I found myself arguing with the TV and disproving, on my limited knowledge of the situations in question, almost every comment he made.  Further while he comes off as very convincing, many should notice that he never really comes to a point, he is merely preaching to hear himself talk.

1837438,1,B00008DDVU,"This 'documentary' is rambling, incoherent blather; a tiresome dose of Moore's diatribe, which he achieves by endlessly interviewing inarticulate people who echo his sentiments. The fleeting moments of intelligence are rare; the man in the blue shirt who talks about the influence of Marilyn Manson, and the sergeant who curtly answers Moore about L.A. pollution, and then ignores him, shine like lamps in the dark.
I'm astounded that tripe like this would win an Oscar, but of course, the Academy has lost much credibility in the last decade or so, and an award is all but meaningless. Moore's Oscar proves it. A lot of this 'documentary' has the feel of those UFO conspiracy films, but is a lot less entertaining.

Moore tries to minimize the gravity and reality of 9/11. He totally distorts facts, and goes back to what he knows best: To confuse, manipulate, and instill fear and hate. If you feed people fear and hate, they are more likely to believe your lies, and film is a fluid medium, that can be sliced and diced to mean many things; discernment and objectivity are needed here, so as not to be fooled by this charlatan.
If you are the type that reads supermarket tabloids and believes the contents, you may find this interesting; if you are a rational, thinking person, you'll see this just isn't very good, in fact it is shoddy filmmaking.",1089331200,20,1351,4.773504273504273
1837439,3,B00008DDVU,"I'm not a huge fan of Mr. Moore or his politics, but I check out opposing viewpoints to reexamine my presuppositions and alter or strengthen them as necessary.  I've heard a lot of general scuttlebutt about him (loud, liberal, etc.), and read the Amazon reviews concerning ""Bowling for Columbine"", so I decided to see for myself what all the controversy was about.
The movie's thesis boils down to this: Americans exist in a state of fear, so they use guns to kill anyone who's a real or perceived threat.  What generates this climate of high anxiety?  It's stoked by the media, with continual coverage of violent crime, corporate mischief, natural disasters, and so on, along with the government and its endless travel advisories and terror alerts.  How do Americans cope?  With excessive material consumption, encouraged by a constant media advertising blitz.  So, we live in perpetual fear, consume beyond our means to medicate ourselves, work at jobs we hate to fund our consumption, buy a gun or two to protect our precarious lifestyle, and cap anyone who messes with our precious consumables or threatens our means of buying them.  What a life.
This seems to be a reasonable diagnosis of a national problem.  Marilyn Manson, an obvious and convenient scapegoat for the average person's dysfunctions, explains the cycle of fear, consumption, and violence quite well when questioned by Mr. Moore.  Just across the border, Mr. Moore establishes that our Canadian neighbors have about as many guns per household as we do.  But they don't blast away at each other nearly as much.  What's their secret?  A positive, laid-back frame of mind, as demonstrated (and encouraged) by a softer-edged media and mellow politicians.  Heck, they don't even lock their doors, as Mr. Moore demonstrates by walking in on a couple of unsuspecting Canucks.  So far, he's done a great job of identifying the existence of an American malady.  At this point in the film, I was prepared for an equally sound treatment of the logical solution:  Americans need a fundamental change of heart, or at least an attitude adjustment, eh.
However, Mr. Moore does not examine an alteration of the American psyche as a possible remedy.  That would've elevated ""Bowling for Columbine"" to greatness.  Instead, he embarks on a crusade to get ammunition out of K-Mart stores and gets in the face of NRA president Charlton Heston.  Despite spending much of the film establishing internal motivations as the problem, Mr. Moore takes the easy way out by blaming guns instead of the people who use them against others.  What good does it do to focus on a symptom instead of the disease?  It will only manifest itself in a different way.  Using Mr. Moore's reasoning, we'd be better off getting rid of our television sets (not a bad idea, actually).
Despite its flaws, I recommend that everyone see ""Bowling for Columbine.""  Mr. Moore has done an excellent job of diagnosing an American problem.  However, anyone seeking thoughtful discourse or debate about a reasonable solution will have to look elsewhere.",1089331200,8,3067,4.9921259842519685

The idea that American history and society is less violent that those of Germany or Britain is just plain wrong - the acts Moore highlights were carried out by the governments, not the citizens of those countries. Both are guilty of massive international crimes in their past, but this provides no evidence whatsoever about the nature of violence in their societies.
The less said about the segment on the 'bomb factory' in Columbine the better, and Moore's editing is crafty and dubious. The work is thoroughly unscholarly, and speaking as a political theorist, would not pass any test of theoretical or argumentative rigour.
However, the liberal left in America need a voice like Moore's if any genuine notion of equality can ever surpass the egalitarian lipservice that is paid to democracy.
Speaking as a Brit, the notion of such a fervent pro-firearms lobby, simply because the constitution permits it, is bordering on the ludicrous.
Moore's point is simple and is supported by the one piece of genuinely hard (although unsourced) evidence in the film - American society is obsessed with guns and, quite simply, guns kill - less guns, less death. And it is a point that should be made over and over again until something is done about it.",1089244800,4,1506,5.00398406374502
1837472,5,B00008DDVU,"I'm getting sick and tired of gun nuts and right wingers bashing Michael Moore for allegedly being unfair to Charlton Heston during his interview for Bowling for Columbine. Hey conservatives! WATCH THE FILM!! I know it's the conservative mantra to condemn something they haven't viewed because (1) One of the conservative legends in their own minds like Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh told them what to think (as usual) or (2) Anything Michael Moore has to be, in their ""fair and balanced"" opinion, slanted, anti-American communist garbage.
Some conservatives have accused Moore of exploiting Heston's Alzheimer condition. News flash, GOPer's! The interview was conducted before Heston revealed he had Alzheimer's disease. Unless Moore is paying off Heston's doctor to give him his medical history, there was no way he could have known about Heston's condition. The damaging quote from Heston is that America's racial diversity is at the root of all the gun violence in America. Moore did not manipulate Heston into saying that. He merely asked Heston, as spokesman of the NRA, what causes all the gun violence in America. Charlton Heston was the spokesman for the National Rifle Association. If he can't handle a simple question from Michael Moore without blaming racial diversity and essentially sticking his foot in his mouth, maybe the NRA should be looking for new leadership instead of calling a completely fair question from Michael Moore dirty pool.
Right wingers love to wrap themselves in the flag and call someone that disagrees with them un-American. I believe strongly in the right to bear arms and keep guns in responsible households for self-protection, but the NRA is yet another right wing fringe nut group that hides behind the 2nd Amendment in order to forward their extremist policies. This, remember, is the organization that claimed that teflon coated ""cop killer"" bullets were a right and that porcelain guns that could be smuggled through metal detectors were protected under the 2nd Amendment (imagine how much more horrific the events of 9/11/01 might have been had our friends at the NRA had their way). Anyone who actually thinks that Michael Moore was being unfair to Charlton Heston in his interview just can't accept the fact that Heston leads a extremist group that can't possibly defend it's policy goals.

Bowling For Columbine really shows the ugly side of CONservatives and exposes their wacky obssession with Guns. Michael Moore does a Great Job in telling about why CONservative Americans are so obssessed with Guns and why they are responsible for The United States having one of the worst murder rates in the world. No One is safe from this Film especially Charlton Heston who Michael Moore really lays to waste. Heston comes off like a CONservative Bitter Old Fool! This Film ROCKS!

1837499,2,B00008DDVU,"I think Moore asks some good questions, makes some interesting suggestions (though I would've liked to see them developed more), and does most of it in an entertaining fashion. However, the tactics that he pulls during the last bit of the film are, in my opinion, a shameful misuse of the camera and of the documenter's power. I speak specifically of the K-Mart, Dick Clark, and Charleton Heston scenes.
To take one example, just think about the Charleton Heston ""interview."" From the beginning of this interview, Moore is (pathetically) trying to bait Charleton Heston in some way. As Heston walks away, Moore delivers a disingenuous appeal to moral sensitivity--as if he was simply (and innocently) thinking an apology from Heston might make the world a better place. Give us a break. In truth, Moore is using a technique from his fairly limited repertoire--namely, the attempt to vilify people he doesn't like. Here Moore was face-to-face with the NRA-head-honcho himself, and do we get a serious dialogue about gun control? No, only Moore's cheap theatrics.
In logic, there is a fallacy called the ""Ad Hominem fallacy""; it occurs when you attack the person presenting the argument instead of the argument itself. I think something similar is being done by Moore in this film. For all I know, Dick Clark and Charleton Heston MAY be old, compassionless, rich, white men (as Moore seems to insinuate), but what bearing does that have on the issues of welfare and gun control? (However, I must add: Walking away from a filmmaker who is anxious to make you look bad in no way demonstrates that you are insensitive to the issues he's addressing. It may just mean that you've got sense.)
I began this film with an open mind (remembering only that Moore was a funny guy I'd seen on TV several years ago) but was very perturbed by the end of it. I'm interested in sorting out my own views about gun control in America, but I found this film to be extremely unhelpful in that enterprise. I worry that many Americans will consider Moore's film to be some sort of argument for Moore's views. In my opinion, the film offers only the weakest support for the various theses he seems to be espousing, and Bowling for Columbine seems much closer to propaganda than respectable documentary.",1088553600,14,2276,4.823529411764706

Because you people know this man is right but aren't willing to admit the wrongs of your conservative ways. I've read a lot of 1 star reviews about this movie and it's pretty obvious these people haven't even watched the movie (yet they still write a review) because they assume that just because this film was made by Michael Moore (a brilliant director and infamous for his controversial political films/documentaries filled with tongue-in-cheek humour) that it will be bad. I agree that he goes overboard sometimes to exploit Americans and their government as much as possible, but can you really blame him? This movie goes into depth about Americans and their right to bear arms and it's connection with the shootings that took place a couple years back at Columbine high school in Colorado. It covers many topics such as  Charlton Heston and the NRA, Marilyn Manson and how his music is claimed to have an influence over troubled youth, a bank that gives out free guns to anyone who opens up a new account, local militia, a town gone insane and issues that every legal-aged citizen must own a firearm and so on and so on. I would love to go into great detail about this movie and bash everyone who claims it was all just a bunch of crap to fill people's heads with liberal propoganda but I won't be able to fit everything in this review so I'll keep it short and sweet. Charlton Heston is a senile old man that is up way past his bedtime to take a long dirt nap in the cold earth (it's kind of hypocritical for a man who appears in a classic movie such as ""The Ten Commandments"" and preaches about the sin of murder (thou shall not kill) to be shown at an NRA meeting a few days after the shootings supporting an instrument of death on national television further enraging families that have lost loved ones at the hands of two disturbed young men, isn't it? Not a very smart move, Charlie). Marilyn Manson (even though I'm not a fan of his music) has been proven to be a renowned yet misunderstood musician who is not even involved in any way in this tragedy, not even subliminally as most of you might be thinking. As for the bank that hands out free guns, that's just plain retarded. I've heard of banks giving out gifts or special offers for becoming a new member, but guns as gifts? That's just going too far, I could use that gun they give me to rob that very bank! A local militia is a really bad idea too because you have these untrained locals taking people's lives and safety within their own hands. Hello retards!...That's what the god damn police are there for and they are always reliable for safety and protection and plus you don't need freakin' AK-47's and automatic rifles for protection. It's not like you small town hicks have anything of high value to protect anyways and small towns usually have low crime rates anyway....try living in New York City and see how badly you would get mugged there. And the town gone nuts, what were you city officials smoking when you passed that law? Michael Moore also conducts a number of interviews with celebrities, government employees, and citizens alike. His intentionally stupid questions spawn a variety of replies and reactions from those he interviews. In conclusion, this movie is another blow to America's already shattered reputation as one of the most dangerous and crime-filled countries in the world run by a bunch of yahoo sons of b****es who can't tell the difference between what is right and what is wrong and another proud accomplishment for Michael Moore. Anyone who shares the same admiration and respect for Michael Moore as I do would be wise to see this movie and check out his other work such as the hilarious ""Canadian Bacon"" or his most recent documentary (this time tackling the issue of Bush and the US/Iraq war) Farenheit 9/11.

- Chartle Heston did not ""rush"" into either shooting location to host NRA meetings. The first in Columbine was scheduled a year in advance and after the shooting, all events except board of directors voting were canceled. The second ""rally"" was footage from a get out the vote meeting, not an NRA meeting.
- Moore combined three Chartle Heston speeches, months after the Columbine shooting, to make him appear uncaring.
- The Clan was formed in 1866, not 1871, the year the NRA was formed. The Clan being declared illegal in 1871 had nothing to do with the NRA.
- Lockhead Martin manufacturing plan near Columbine does not produce ""weapons of mass destruction"" but rockets to launch satellites into space.
- The opening plot of Moore getting a free gun from a bank was staged, as both New York state law, where Moore's from, and Michigan state law require a waiting period to aquire any fire arm.
I could go on and on. How you people conintue to blindly quote the gospel according the Moore and ignore his long-since exposed lies is beyond me.
As for this movie, I will not see it after having sceptically read his ""Stupid White Men"" then saw all the holes poked through that. too. Wake up America. Moore hates this country, Bush even more, and will twist the truth to pull as many suckers into his fantasy world as possible.

1837518,1,B00008DDVU,"For openers, allow me to point out a duly missed fact: Michael Moore is not a documentarian. He admits it himself. Though his movies contain facts (though they're overshadowed by preposterous lies), he intentionally spotlights his liberal views. These aren't unbiased facts. His films are the world viewed with a liberal agenda. Anyway, onto the film.
As overwhelming as some may find this film, this was no more than an exaggerated, overly hyped piece of crap that is meant to shake you up with facts when it's actually plagued with absurdity. For instance, Moore enters a bank that offers a rifle in reward for conducting business with it. In his depiction, he appears to walk in, open an account, and walk out with a firearm. But that is remarkably misleading. Moore actually had to wait for several weeks before that to apply for a weapon. As the law dictates, the bank underwent a thorough background check for at least three weeks. Although it may still very well be absurd that such a reward would be given, I found it odd how Moore had failed to put things into perspective.
The statistics are also unbeliavable. It's EXTREMELY unfathomable that Canada's annual homicides would be that low. Either the American death rate had to be inflated (though I seriously doubt it was) or, as I'm pretty damn confident they were, the Canadian rates were lowered.
The world needs to grasp that Michael Moore is a lying man. The guy publicly lied about being banned from the Jay Leno Show as well as the O'Reilly Factor, simply for the sake of promoting his image. The man is an opportunist, as well. Note that he was a card-carrying member of the NRA before he made ""Columbine,"" but chose to please the masses by putting this out.
In conclusion, the placement of a Columbine victim on Charlton Heston's doorstep is simply going too far. The man made his point as it is,

1837519,4,B00008DDVU,"BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, Michael Moore's unabashedly liberal, opinionated take on America's gun culture, is, if nothing else, a great piece of op-ed filmmaking that offers some valuable insights that, if you are open to hearing them, might change the way you think about not only our obsession with guns, but also change the way you look at our media. Certainly, one of the most convincing passages of the movie for me was a segment in the middle that showed how fearmongering our media can be, and how they can sometimes drum up too much fear in all of us simply by how they choose what stories to cover (""if it bleeds, it leads""). After watching that, I don't think anyone can ever truly be wholly uncritical of the media ever again.
So, okay, Michael Moore has the unfortunate reputation of sometimes staging what seems like ""found"" events in his films, and you cannot always trust what Moore claims to be fact in them. And some of those stunts he thinks of for his films---there's one here in which he takes two victims of Columbine and brings them to a local Walmart in an attempt to force them to faze out the selling of bullets, a stunt which actually works---can sometimes be more a debit to his argument than a credit (Moore admittedly does sometimes come off as overly smug, in here and his most recent film, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, also a great film.)
Yet, one must admit that Moore is a tremendous moviemaker, who makes his films out of passion and a need to throw certain topics into the realm of public forum via the medium of film. And if his overall message sometimes feels muddled during the course of BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE---what is he really trying to say by connecting the fact that Columbine happened on the same day as one of the biggest days of bombing in Kosovo?---well, maybe that is merely the sign of a man searching for some kind of truth in a muddled political field. If this film doesn't at least make you think, then you probably haven't been receptive enough to be able to receive his message.

I was very disappointed to say the least.  I was amazed at Moore's ability to manipulate situations to suit himself.  Most of the time he came off as a crazy loon asking very stupid questions.  I understand that it was supposed to be sarcasm, but sarcasm is not the first thing I think of when it comes to teens shooting up their school.
One of his biggest mistakes in my opinion was blaming Dick Clark for a little girl's death.  Not only did he blame Dick Clark personally, but he also tracked the man down to try to get an interview.  It was painful and embarrassing to watch Moore carry on and yell at Dick Clark on the side of the road.
Moore is also one heck of a terrible actor.  Chasing Charlton Heston around Heston's home trying to get him to look at the picture of the slain girl was ghastly.  Moore then licked his acting chops, and begged Heston to look at the picture.  I was appalled.  I know I was supposed to be appalled that Heston refused to do it, but instead I was appalled at Moore. Michael Moore is so transparent.  I didn't fall for it and I really can't believe other people did.
I think the film did have valid points and could drum up intellectual debate, but weeding through the fiction proved more work than I anticipated from a ""documentary"".",1088208000,8,1451,4.376865671641791

Explain again how K-Mart was responsible for a couple of kids going on a murder spree?  I guess that my family should go after Coors and Shell Oil if I get killed by a drunk driver.  The drunk driver should not be held responsible for his actions, because Shell put gas in his car and Coors put alcohol in his blood...damn those evil corporations.

I see Michael Moore much the same way as I see my friend Jim. He may not always be on the mark, but he is a passionate defender of the ideas of his constituents.  I give Michael Moore at A+
for bravery and willingness to take on ""the system.""
In some ways, Moore is the like the student in the back of the room shooting spit balls, just to get a reaction from the teacher, but he is also a strong defender of every man..the common man, against the arrogance of the elite, and there is certainly enough of that to go around.  That is why Michael deserves 5 stars for his effort putting together this film.
I hope Moore has a long and productive life and is not embittered by his angry detractors.

1837559,3,B00008DDVU,"Documentaries are tough fare to objectively review because if you disagree with the director's ideas (as I do in this case) it tends to color the entire review and minimize or shut out some of the more interesting aspecets of the film.
In Bowling For Columbine, Moore sets out to answer the question: Why do American's kill each other in greater numbers than any other democratic nation? Does Moore actually answer this?  Not really.  In fact, one of the most infuriating aspects of this film is that the director piles on theory after theory to answer the premise(War in Kosovo, Lockheed Martin's Littleton plant, welfare-to-work programs etc. each resulting in bits that are mildly humorous and sometimes dramatic)  but makes little headway in answering the question.  Granted, its hard to answer a question that has as many facets as crime in America while simultaneously keeping it watchable, but by the time the credits roll, we should have some kind of an answer.
A microcosm of all the problems with the film is interview ""shock-rocker"" Marylin Manson, on whom some have tried to blame the shootings.  While rightly pointing out that a connection between the two is absurd, Moore doesn't explain how blaming it on Lockheed Martin's Littleton plant for making missles (neither Klebold nor Harris' parents worked at the plant) and such is any less absurd (incidentally it has been reported that the Littleton plant doesn't make weapons, but TV satellites).  Moore ends the scene by adding, apropos of nothing, that on the day of the shootings the president dropped more bombs on Kosovo than any day during the war.  Theories like this are regularly dropped in without really explaining if there is any hard evidence to substantiate how they link to shootings throughout the film.
Moore's only real stab at a solution is that we should be more like Canada (a country that has more than its share of guns, but a tiny fraction of gun deaths).  Why Canada should be our model, Moore never really delivers to the viewer.  He drops hints that it may be socialized medicine, but like most everything in the film (including the theory I found most promising and believable: the media reporting violent crimes, which has been skyrocketing for quite some time vs. the violent crime rate, which has been falling for a while), he never adequately explains why!
While the film's hopping from theory to theory was iritating to say the least, it was entertaining throughout and each theory usually contained a funny/scary bit or a poignant moment.  Maybe satire and not documentary would be more suitable to Moore's talents?  The bottom line is that the film is fun to watch, but it probably shouldn't be taken too seriously  as an answer to our problems",1087603200,7,2744,4.90280777537797

Michael Moore is someone who can create a mood that is clear, somewhat one sided and can really get to the viewer, however, what was his point here?
He takes a rather wide swipe at America as a whole using two shootings that just happen to have an NRA meeting on the heals of them, one of course in Columbine High, and the other in his hometown of Flint Michigan.  The irony here is devastingly clear.
Michael takes on people from every side in this video, the NRA headed up by Charlton Heston, the military industrial complex, the media, Clinton for his role in the bombings in Kosovo, Bush post 9-11 and a large budget for the war machine, Kerry is viewed quickly.  So, although mostly seeming to blame the current administration, he finds fault with the American system as a major culprit.
Yet, what is he asking us to do?  The reason I rated this a ""4"" was the impact that it had on me, especially but for the view that we are a society that is living in fear.  We hear about things all day long that make us afraid, and his vignettes regarding fear are well put together to get the viewer to acknowledge we are taught to fear.
However, Michael takes on a somewhat cordial man who invites him into his home, Heston, and seems to ambush him during his interview.  He weaves together pictures making it seem that Heston is referring to a quote, ....from my cold dead hands.... that you may think was voiced immediately after Columbine in the NRA, apparently national conference, obviously scheduled months prior to the massacre.  That quote and very brief video clip is from some time later.  The remainder of the clip is from the Heston speech in Denver.  (to get a great view of the whole text of Hestons speech go to Michael's website, yet you may want to peruse the web also.)
His story about Flint though is very touching indeed and we all need to take notice that we need to solve our national problems and quickly.  He shows how the welfare to work program has further hurt those that it was supposed to free from welfare.  He does not do so objectively though and we are given the perspective that the current administration was the one who came up with that.....although not expressed, you get that feel.
Michael would have hit his mark in this film like he did in Roger and Me if he would have tackled things much more objectively.  He goes after the person whose name is on the restaurant of an employee involved in the movie.....there are implications that he is responsible for her situation.  What is he wanting that man to do?  We never know and we are left wondering what Michael's intent is in tracking him down.
If I had the chance to ask MM some things I would want to know what he is doing as an American, who has made millions by selling his very interesting material, what is he doing for Flint, for the high school in the video with facilities that are lacking?  I mean I do not expect him to flaunt what he does, but is he helping in any way to assist the needy?
I feel Michael does his part in pointing out things in our society that should create concern and motivate us to change.  Yet what is he wanting us to do now that he has informed us?",1087257600,6,3408,4.420127795527157
1837562,1,B00008DDVU,"There are many problems with not only the facts of the movie, but also the editing, and the rambling done by the film's director, Michael Moore.  In the end the film was way too long and the film contradicted itself more times than it didn't.  Moore gives no answer to certain problems that the U.S. has, but instead many - and they all contradict each other.  He seems to take every chance he has to put down the U.S. and exagerates the problems that it has.  I would say that this film is also anti-American, but constructive criticism has always been a very American thing to do.  However, this criticism is not constructive but instead somewhat nutty.  Moore seems to enjoy hearing himself talk.  I think he has more personal problems than the U.S. has as a country.

1837563,1,B00008DDVU,"~As a Canadian living in the United States, I was very interested in Mr. Moore's bizarre and extremely dishonest portrayal of the Canadian experience. There was a worse mass shooting than Columbine in my home town of Montreal about fifteen years ago: 14 people were shot dead at the University of Quebec at Montreal in 1989.  And the day after Columbine, there was a deadly copy-cat shooting at a high school in the Canadian province of Alberta.
  Almost everything that he says about Canada~~ is false.  He claims that Canadians don't have to lock their doors, but that is nonsense: Canada has higher rates of burglary than the US.  He also claims that minorities make up 11% of the population in both countries, but that is a lie: Blacks and Hispanics alone are 25% of the US, while they make up only 3% of the population in Canada.
  And it isn't just Canada he lies about.  Germany had a worse high school shooting than Columbine a few years ago, and the worst school shooting of~~ all time occured about ten years ago in Scotland, so the problem is not an American one.
  Honest criticism of the United States doesn't make one anti-American.  But when your criticism is based on repeated lies, as Mr. Moore's is, then it most certainly is.~",1087171200,34,1245,4.613636363636363

Moore heavily edits speeches (often inserting pieces from an entirely DIFFERENT speech at a different time, as with Charlton Heston), creates ""facts"" or puts them so out of context as to eliminate factual content, or stages scenes so as to make his point.

Through out it you can see the Moore was trying to go certain directions with it, but found his assumptions to be not really what he was expecting. I don't think any where in this movie does it say you shouldn't own a gun, because guns are evil, it even says that Canada has a lot of guns. If Moore didn't put in his political opinions this movie would be a whole lot more accepting of the right. So when a conservative watches this movie and you don't agree with his political view then don't make that the may point in the movie. Moore brings up good questions and as Americans this is something we should be concerned about and want to stop, why should we not be concerned about people killing each other. One person mentioned that Moore has a lot of unfinished points, because he doesn't have the answer to why people kill each other, this isn't something that can be solved so simply and by one person.
I found this movie to be very good and everyone should see it atleast once so that the question goes through our heads and maybe we can make a difference some how. To the person that talked about boycotting Farenheit 9/11, don't limit your mind.

* Manufacture, distribute and glorify the means of violence, and VIOLENCE is what you will get.
* Make firearms easily available, and people WILL avail of them.
* The media choosing to report only violent acts makes for a more violent society in a symbiotic sort of way.
* This nouveau-culture has a recent history of imperialism, racial suppression and genocide. These vibrations are everywhere hovering below the surface - in the Wild West's tales of ""heroism"", to the idol worship of serial killers, to the recent attempts at ""liberating"" Iraq.
Most people who own and use firearms invoke one of more of these reasons , as seen in the film - (#) That it is a birth-right in a hunter-gatherer sense of the word (#) That one needs firearms for self-protection when the nation's policing agencies have failed to deliver (#) For hunting - invoking an atavistic hunter-gatherer era, since clearly one does not need to hunt in the modern age.
Gun control in the US is insufficient, and the cultural climate is far too permissive. That, and Charlton Heston is not cool. Just watch the interview and squirm at his pre-Cambrian views.
Moore effectively marshals several facts and lines of thought towards this ineluctable conclusion - Violence and the Tools Of Violence is an industry, and people somewhere are profiting from it by playing on the fear ever present in society.
The way I look at the Daily News has changed forever after watching this documentary. The violence-bias is obvious, and totally unnecessary.

Michael Moore obviously has some skill at both making a film and making at point, and boy what a point does he make. In this ""fact-based"" documentary, he praises Canada, denounces the American Gun Culture, ""exposes"" the racism in the media and in the country, and generally lets us know how dumb our presidents are, all in the interest of showing us why the Columbine Shootings occured. A valid point, and definately a topic worthy of a documentary.
Unfortunately, Moore ruins it. He uses all his talent at film making and editing to splice together (he calls it shortening) speeches so that the viewer only sees what he wants them to see. Statistics presented in the movie are not grounded in fact. At one point, he ADDS WORDS to an old political commercial in order to make it look like something it was not. The ""documentary"" is filled with lies and falsehoods. There are many websites which can explain this in greater detail, although I reccommend [...] since it's more concise.

Just because you have the right to own a gun why would you? why can't we as americans calm down about every single threat some other country has brought on?

Michael Moore is astonishingly fat. The man is fat. That alone calls his credibility into judgment. How can I take a man seriously who cannot control his own carbohydrate intake, really? And can you trust him? He could be hiding anything in those greasy rolls of fat. A hacksaw, a machete, even a AK-47. He could slide it out and take any one of us down at any time. And why? Perhaps we unwittingly stood between him and the last Krispy Kreme doughnut. What a pity. No one's life deserves to end on the business end of an AK-47 while pudgy hands grasp greedily for overly sugared confections. That is why he makes a good point about gun control. We should work to keep guns out of the hands of children and fat man. One time this dude who looked frighteningly like Dom DeLuise walked into Outback Steakhouse in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin with a Glock and started screaming ""Give me all your pork ribs and no one gets hurt!"" It's because the guy's barbeque sauce blood ratio became low and the man became disoriented and confused. The cops slapped the cuffs on him while he was finishing off a side of steak fries, and the man claimed he didn't remember anything after his wife told him they were having Chicken Caesar Salad for dinner.
My point is, gun control is good if it will keep guns out of the hands of crazy fat men like Michael Moore. Just think of the late Chris Farley. Would you trust him with a gun? No way. But he deftly sidesteps the issue of whether fatties should have guns.

1837617,2,B00008DDVU,"I don't belong to the NRA nor do I support their mission.  That being said, I found Bowling for Columbine to be without merit for the following reasons.
First, Moore's many interviews add little to our understanding of the tragedy at Columbine High School.  In fact, the film reminded me more of David Letterman making fun of his guests than Charlie Rose trying to understand the meaning of a serious problem by talking with intelligent people with information to share.  Additionally, without the variety of point of view needed to give balance to the discussion, the film dragged on and on.
Next, Moore's editing of his material was similar to the tiny bits and pieces of information shown on the evening news to hold the attention of a public needing constant stimulation and entertainment. Moore needs to take a lesson from Jim Lehrer who stays focused on his subject in order to arrive at reasonable closure.  Also, Moore juxtaposes images to manipulate his audience and suggest valid comparison where none exists.
Lastly, Moore takes a shotgun approach to his documentary.  He fires his blasts here and there hoping to get a hit and occasionaly he does, but the hits are few and far between.  At the end of the film Moore interviews Charlton Heston, looking much the worse for wear and tear, and tries to get Heston to tell us why Columbine happened.  Heston hasn't a clue and neither does Moore.  I thought I might get some insight about the tragedy at Columbine, but all I got was tragedy turned into a bad Hollywood film.

1837619,3,B00008DDVU,"I like Michael Moore's films and Bowling For Columbine is no exception. In fact, I've seen it twice. (Something I rarely do.) Plus, I've begun to watch tapes of his TV shows and I will be one of the first in line to see his next effort. I think Michael Moore comes across as a man of great conscience. He uses his camera as a mighty weapon against injustice where ever it may hide and this includes topics the mainstream media will not touch. Particularly corporate crime. It takes a scandal of monumental proportions such as Enron to even register on the radar screens of the major news outlets. There is much to be proud of in Bowling for Columbine, but there are also some things for which Michael Moore should be ashamed. Michael Moore should be thrilled that he was able to play a part in ridding K-Mart of its bullets, it would not have been done but for the deadly aim of his lens. That is by far the most powerful scene in the film. Yet, he uses the same tactics in one of the most heartless scenes ever-committed film, the cinematic sucker punch of NRA president Heston. Yes, we got to see Mr. Heston humiliate himself by suggesting that America's gun violence is due to the fact that we are ""ethically mixed."" Heston said it of his own free will and he should be held accountable for it. It's what Moore does next that is despicable. He chases Heston with a picture of Kayla Roland and leaves it outside his house when he refuses to look at it. Heston DID NOT deserve that. There are other things in the film that are not shameful but rather absurd. The day of the massacre at Columbine was also the day of the most aggressive US bombing of Kosovo; I will concede this was an ironic coincidence. Moore takes it a step further; he tries to compare Lockeed Martin's production of WMDs with the carnage at Columbine. That's just silly, and according to another reviewer that plant may not even make WMDs. Oh, and let's not forget Moore's undying love for Canada. Moore could very well have a point about Canada being less violent, I don't know, I haven't looked into it. But does it strike anyone else as a little odd that Bowling For Columbine would be produced by Alliance Atlantis, a Canadian company? Its things like these that serve to weaken an otherwise strong film. Moore might also have a point about the media helping to create a more fearful America, but that was no more a cause of the murders at Columbine than shock rock, video games/movies, or even *sarcastic laugh* lack of prayer in schools. Everyone wants to know why Columbine happened and they seem to forget that the killers have already told us. They said, ""we're doing this because you made fun of us."" The siege at Columbine was the reaction of two teenagers pushed over the edge by merciless ridicule. Of course this doesn't excuse what they did, but you cannot ignore that this is an answer almost unanimously echoed by other school shooters. The most perplexing moment in the entire film comes when Moore speaks to a group of Canadian teenagers about what they would do instead of picking up a gun. Shockingly they said they would tease the aggressor into submission. This suggestion was made by the one with green hair and a face piercing, the type of person that typically gets harassed at a regular high school. I know because many of them came to the arts magnet high school I attended to escape such things.
  Last but not least I would like to address Moore's now infamous Academy Awards acceptance speech. I think he should be absolutely ashamed, and should have issued an immediate apology. What he said is irrelevant. I have a problem with when and where he said it. I am sick of celebrities thinking that just because they are famous everyone wants to hear their opinion. Richard Gere comes dangerously close to condoning the events of September 11th in a room full of firemen, Sean Penn takes it upon himself to prove there are no WMDs in Iraq, and the Dixie Chicks insult the President on foreign soil. That incident is my favorite because their comments finally fell on very unfriendly ears, which just happened to be the ears of their fans. I thought that incident would turn into a public relations firestorm from which they would never recover, and as such serve as a lesson to other entertainers that the world is not their pulpit. Alas, the backlash was ridiculously short-lived. I find Michael Moore's rant to be particularly disappointing because unlike Gere, Penn and the Dixie Chicks, Michael Moore could have said something of great importance, let's not forget that Moore was given those five minutes to reflect on his film, and on Columbine. Instead he wasted it on something that was completely unrelated. For those who say that ""Bowling for Columbine"" wasn't just about Columbine, then I would argue that using the tragedy to try and make a ""larger point about American violence,"" which is a polite way of saying ""to further another agenda"" (a spin on par with those spewed by O'Reily) is a shameful an exploitive thing to do.",1083974400,3,5037,4.614269788182832

He seemed to point out that while Canada has a lot of guns, they have around 100 murders a year. (Kinda interesting to point out that in Toronto he talks to a police officer who remembers 1 murder in the past decade, and that was commited by a man from Detroit.)

1837622,3,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore has probably earned more than a few haters after his Oscar rant against Bush, and it's easy to find backlash against this film online.
Overall, I found this a pretty good documentary.  For one, like most of Moore's work, it's very entertaining.
However, like most of Moore's work, it's also bombastic and a bit much at times, and this deluxe 2 DVD set is more Moore than I could handle at times.
Moore is a leftist who has regularly cries out against both parties (or the one big party in America) and encourages radical change over partisan games.  He can come off as somewhat of a blowhard, and very into himself.  But there are few people making films like his, and I think it's good that a movie like this managed to reach a wide audience.
Bowling for Columbine takes the infamous school shooting as a take-off point about the love of violence in America and its link to gun availability and gun culture.  Moore himself is an NRA member since his youth, familiar with firearms and shooting, so it's not guns per se that bother him.  His tone is often one of general curiousity over the seeming obsession with guns in America, and the violence that exists everywhere
from the classroom to the battlefields overseas.  His journey takes him to Littleton, Colorado, where he admits what struck him most was how normal it appeared, like any other suberb in America.  So what would make two teens go ballistic one day
and kill fellow students, after going bowling of all things in the morning.
Moore works a number of angles, including the proximity of military installations to the area, or factories where military-industrial materials are produced.  He interviews a number of people drawn into the circle of fire after Columbine including Charlton Heston and Marilyn Manson.  Thankfully, Moore is not convinced by the typical argument that violent movies, violent television, violent video games and angry music would cause two suburban teens to shoot up their school.  Nor is it Marilyn Manson, who was cited as the cause of all of this, an absurd assertion made all the more laughable by shots of Joe Lieberman denouncing the artist and his group as 'the sickest rock group ever'.  Joe, get back to Earth.
I had a problem with some of the presentation.  He condemns Charlton Heston for hosting an NRA rally near Columbine shortly after the shootings, fine.  But the rally certainly appeared popular, if distasteful.  Charlton Heston is not the problem.
Moore shows up at Heston's house at the end and interviews him.  It's clear Heston is trying to be somewhat accomodating, but is then thrown some questions he can't possibly answer, and the end result is he looks like a fool.  The sequence ends with
Moore haranguing the man in his own house, somehow drawing a link between a child killed many miles away with a gun and Charlton Heston's spokemanship for the NRA.  Why would he pick on Heston and not Manson?  Neither is responsible, and both try and give honest opinions.  Manson actually comes off as one of the most articulate of the interviewees, go figure.
Also, some of the statistics that are flashed on the screen and some of the assertions and facts are a bit skewed, if only to get a reaction, which is Moore's point.
Still, it's a good documentary.  Thought-provoking,entertaining, and somewhat sincere.  At least someone is trying to make films like this. The DVD is packed with features, which will entice those with interest.",1083801600,4,3459,4.799325463743676

Bowling for Columbine is completely an ""in your face - no holds barred"" kind of movie.  I personally think that Michael Moore is brilliant.  His books are amazing as are his films.  He asks the questions and talks about the subjects that people would rather sweep under the mat.
In BFC, Moore sets out to explore the roots of why the United States of America is notorious for its astronomical number of people killed by firearms.  In doing so, he learns that the conventional answers of easy availability of guns, violent national history, violent entertainment and even poverty are inadequate to explain this violence when other cultures share those same factors without the equivalent carnage.

I am a member of a pistol and rifle club and I know those people well.  They are not crazy criminals either.  Would you like Michael Moore to make a documentary that twisted the truth and lied about something you love?
Don't focus your evidence to state your case on fringe groups and radicals just to envoke emotion, by using that logic you would be able to state that anyone who rides a motorcycle is a drugged out member of a radical motorcycle gang and therefore all motorcycles should be banned to stop the spread of violence and crime that these gangs have been attributed with doing.  Should we ban cars because some people drink and drive and kill people?
Just because you enjoy having the right to own the gun you want does not make you a crazy criminal.  I have shot hundreds of thousands of rounds over the years and I have never ever gone on a killing rampage nor have I ever had the desire to do so.  The NRA is not some evil empire.  It is a political action group that was formed to protect our rights from people who, because they think they know best, would like to limit what I can and can not purchase and own.  Check out [...] to get the truth.
The NRA wouldn't have power unless they had members and it looks like they have a lot of members.  When you talk about taking power away from the NRA, you are saying you want to take mine and many others voices away in politics.  I bet you wouldn't like it if someone made a movie and lied about the ACLU (although they wouldn't have to lie about those nuts) just to try and destroy them.
I own lots and lots of guns and even more ammo.  I've left my guns unlocked many, many times and guess what?  They never jumped up and loaded themselves and shot someone.  Those kids in Columbine pulled the triggers.  They broke the law not the NRA.
I have a concealed handgun license as well.  I'm willing to bet that if we were all eating in a resturant and some crazy criminal came through the door with illegally obtained firearms blazing away, you would come over and shake my hand and thank me after I put a bullet between the guys eyes.  Criminals are going to get guns if they want them.  The only thing that so called ""gun-control"" does is take them out of the hands of honest citizens.  Use your mind a little bit people.
(...)  I lived in a country that denied its citizens the right to own and carry firearms for three years while in the Navy.  Guess what?  The criminals still had firearms and were more bold when they decided to rob you because they knew the honest people had no way of defending themselves.  Bad guys will always have guns.

1837637,1,B00008DDVU,"Oh wait, Christopher Guest and This Is Spinal Tap beat Mr. Moore to that 20 years ago.

In all seriousness, Bowling For Columbine is a fabrication by a deeply cynical sensationalist trying to push his agenda on the general public. He should have his Oscar revoked--not for his thesis, which is harmless at best and half-baked at worst. No, the real problem with Bowling For Columbine is its intentional deception.

Go ahead on to [...] the viewer will be STUNNED at the level of deception Mr. Moore resorts to in this propaganda piece (one does not dare call it a documentary; that would imply that Bowling For Columbine is non-fiction). Go ahead; check the sources. Watch the movie. You will spot Moore's edits of Charleton Heston's speeches (amongst other things) in his search for the ""truth."" Moore is indeed a skilled filmmaker...in the way that Joseph Goebbels was an excellent writer.

As for the movie's message itself--well, it does raise an interesting point or two, even if his final thesis reads like a contradiction of his original premise. Paraphrasing: ""Canada is a country full of gun nuts, yet they have far fewer gun related deaths than we do."" So now he's mirroring the NRA position of ""Guns don't cause violence, people do""; except that Moore casts his blame on a sensationalist media. Kind of pot-kettle-black, don't you think?

For the record, I'm not specifically right-wing, nor am I a leftist. Just a person who demands that the American media tell the truth for a change, and that goes for both sides of the political spectrum. And I am not going to devalue integrity by supporting this thought-provoking, but ultimately muddled and willingly deceptive ""documentary.""",1081555200,16,1693,4.950704225352113
1837648,3,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore angers a ton of people with this slightly self-serving documentary about violence and fear in the United States. Moore uses the most terrible examples of gun violence from the past 5-10 years to show how backwards gun laws really are.
Moore tried to answer his question ""Why is there so much gun violence and deaths in the US compared to any other country in the world?"" He tried to use the normal answers like television, our history, race, poverty, video games, music, etc. What Moore came up with was right on... the media. The media's portrayal of news, interesting stories and things to look out for condition the public to fear everything, everyone everywhere, especially minorities.
Although for some parts of the documentary I found myself seeing Michael Moore use the same sort of tactics that nightly news uses, he definitely put together a great piece of art that was Oscar worthy (despite the fact that the extras of him retelling the night exemplified megalomania).
Many people are reviewing this movie and focusing on dates, times and details that avoid the point of the film, which apparently must be restated:
1) It is ok for people to own guns within reason: a handgun/shotgun to protect a family/property; a rifle to hunt with.
2) The biggest problem is not the NRA, although their answers to question posed were very Bush-like (fuzzy, avoiding, and illogical), the problem is the way the media reacts and advertises. They try and make people fear the onset of spring and sunsets! NEXT AT 11 -- THE SUN WILL BE COMING UP RED TOMORROW MORNING -- IS THIS ANOTHER TEQUILA SUNRISE OR ARMAGEDDON? also, the bush administration rejects the kyoto protocol, allowing big corporations to pump pollution into the air making sunrises red (if we have time).",1080950400,5,1777,4.887417218543046

1837650,3,B00008DDVU,"I really wanted to like this film and it's producer. Always considering myself a gun-control advocate, I also had recoiled at the Littleton school shootings. It honestly pains me that I can not give Moore's work a higher rating.
Within hours of the event, Littleton represented an unsightly coalition of politics, school safety, and intra-community pluralism debates. Until it hit the affluent Denver suburb, people were content to pretend that school shootings were only something that happened in the inner cities (the enviroment suburbs were theoretically supposed to protect from). Littleton changed everything permanently.
I realized the founding fathers inserted the Second Amendment in a time when there was no police and little evidence of goverment balance. In the abscence of supermarkets, guns were also a critical food source, no hunting could translate into no food supply. If they had lived today, the signers would be aghast some people are insisting on the right to purchase AK-47's. They would most likely be with Moore, myself and other peole who believe the right is not absolute and there are reasonable health and safety restrictions which can exist with the Amendment in place.
For another perspective, he travels to Canada. Although they do not have a Second Amendment, their streets are so safe the citizens do not lock their doors at night. Not coincidentally, the crime rate is so low that murders are an isolated occurence in that country. They are bewildered that Americans would want the chance to hurt others.
My problem with this film is Moore wastes two hours repeating his message. This potentially backfires with his 'alternative' doccumentary style which bluntly delivers the message the first time presented. Moore takes two hours to present information easily delivered in an hour and 30 minutes format. He does not appear to understand that we were already with him during the first time, and it is not how much you say but how you say things which attracts viewers.
Films are supposed to educate the audience, not make them look at their watches in a state of desperation. The best film in the world fails to live up to it's potential if key audiences (both the people who originally want to see and those needing to see a film) are detered by the length.

 Some of the facts that this documentary explains are really quite sad but are very true as well.
 Such a fact was the incident in Flint, Michigan where a 6 year old kid actually shot another 6 year old classmate to death with a firearm that he had acquire from an uncle days before then.

 Dick Clark is just a greedy egotist who cares nothing for the poorer workers who work for his business! Pretty sick!

More importantly however, they blindly bashed him for his opinions and depictions of such without ever debating. And in fact, this is what the movie partially is about - the ignorance and stupidity of the mainstream American population.
Now I know that you conservatives from the small town USA love your guns and SUV's and like to blindly point to the ""The Right to bear Arms"" amendment in the Constitution, but this same amendment would also imply the possesions of such arms as nuclear weapons, as Michael Moore wisely pointed it out in his movie. But I guess the conservative logic doesn't extend this far...
I also saw someone point out that Michael Moore gave statistics of the number of gun deaths in America in comparison to other countries, like Canada, France and England and that it's wrong because it's not per population. Well, you know what, a simple calculation in your tiny brains would suggest that even per population or per capita, America still has by far the highest crime rate by guns of all nations. Look on your atlases, see the population of those countries and then do a simple proportion... instead of distorting the truth!
It's true that Micheal Moore is a left winger, like Bush is a right winger, but that doesn't diminish the level of objectivity nor truth employed in this documentary. The numbers were real, the people were real and statistics were accurate and even more importantly it had an important and thought provoking thesis supported by solid facts and reality.
And stop saying ""I am a proud member of NRA"", because it's just a stupid and meaningless thing to say. Anyone can join NRA, it doesn't take skills, nor talent to do that.

1837683,4,B00008DDVU,"Documentary film makers necessarily bring a certain point of view with them: it is there in the material they have selected, in what they show and do not show, in how they work their bits of film together to make a cohesive statement.  But while the vast majority of documentary film makers prefer to hide themselves behind the camera--and thus give the illusion of impartiality--Michael Moore does not.  Not only director but also narrator, interviewer, and visible front man, he has no qualm in letting you know right out of the gate that the point of view is his own from start to finish.

Most people will probably agree that it is a gutsy thing to do, but that is probably ALL they are likely to agree upon about BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE.  Ask ten people what the film is about and you are likely to get ten different answers.  Ask the same ten whether they liked it or not and you will probably get two extremes: they either loved it or they hated it.  Those who love it tend to champion it as a powerful statement in favor of gun control.  Those who hate it tend to consider it an inaccurate attack on gun owners in general and the NRA in particular.

But I think it is a mistake to see the film from either stance.  It is true that Moore has a lot to say about easy access to and irresponsible handling of firearms; it is also true that the NRA (not to mention then-president Charleton Heston) come in for a major beating at his hands.  But when all is said and done, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is no more ""about"" gun control or the NRA than it is about the infamous Columbine High School incident.  When you get right down to the marrow, Moore seems to be making a comment on how both politicians and corporations work to take advantage of the paranoia created in the citizenry by a mass media focused on what is sensational rather than upon what is actually important.

There has been a lot of complaints that Moore has fiddled the facts to suit his agenda and that BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is riddled with inaccuracies.  Indeed, there are entire websites (most of them little more than badly researched hysterical rants) devoted to the exposure of these flaws.  But whether or not you buy into all or even most of Moore's data, it does seem to me that he has a valid overall point.  To throw it out on the basis of surface errors--or still worse, the bizarre idea that documentaries should reside in some rarefied atmosphere of absolute impartiality--is an even greater error than any inaccuracy or bias that exists in the film itself.

Whether you actually agree with the film or not, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is truly one film that will hold your attention to the bitter end: often laugh-out-loud funny, wildly satirical, bitterly ironic, opinionated, thought-provoking, and extremely disquieting, it makes a powerful statement.  But I do have one complaint, and it is a significant one.  Moore doesn't seem to communicate any consistent idea re what he thinks we should do about any of it.

How do we dispense with the media-fueled paranoia that leaves us vulnerable to corporate and political hucksters?  Obviously by critical rather than reactionary thinking, but this isn't really something that Moore specifically states in the course of the film.  Very well, but how do we break the cycle that encourages reactionary rather than critical thinking?  And to that question Moore has no answer at all.  When this open ended quality combines with the film's often brilliant but frequently scattered approach ... well, it just might leave you feeling none the wiser than you were when you came in.

The DVD comes with several extras, some of them very interesting--most particularly the ""Return to Denver/Littleton Featurette,"" an interview with Joe Lockart, and an interview with Charlie Rose.  Final thought: more than worth seeing, but one way or another your reaction is likely to extreme.

Al Gore was also in the area as well for this Get Out the Vote campaign, but I don't see any Republicans trying to blame Gore for what happened to Kayla.  It was just one stop in a whirlwind trip.  Later in the film when Moore interviews Heston, he asks him about the rally in Michigan, only he doesnt ask him why Heston held a ""pro gun rally"", he asked him why Heston held a ""big rally"".  Maybe just a coincidence, or maybe Moore knew that if he asked Heston about a ""pro gun rally"" in Michigan, Heston would have told him that he never held a ""pro gun rally"", making Moore look like a fool.

1837706,4,B00008DDVU,"In 2002, the outspoken filmmaker Michael Moore directed, wrote, produced and starred in a controversial documentary entitled ""Bowling for Columbine"".  The film focuses not only upon the very tragic Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in 1999, but also upon many Americans' predilection for gun ownership and gun violence.  The film begins with an animated narrative about American history that begins to introduce the reasons that Michael Moore attributes to the very large amount of gun violence that exists within the U.S.  As Michael Moore thoughtfully points out, of all industrialized nations in the world today, the U.S. is the leader in the number of victims of gun violence with more than 11,000 deaths in 2001.  Conversely, Australia's number of gun violence victims for the same year was less than 40. (Several other nations' statistics are also shown, all much lower than the U.S., including neighboring Canada, France and England.)
As Moore focuses on the two teenaged boys that committed the Columbine massacre, he points out the interesting coincidence that Moore grew up in Minnesota near where one of the boys had also lived for several years.  It was also the home to Charleton Heston, who is and has been the president of the National Rifle Association, as well as the location where the men who were convicted of being the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombers were involved with a local militia.  Moore interviews current militia members, John Nichols (brother of one the Oklahoma City bombers, Terry Nichols) and Charleton Heston.  He also interviews several of the Columbine massacre victims and Matt Stone, a former Columbine High School graduate, who is also one of the creators of the very popular animated TV series ""South Park"", which was modeled on the city of Columbine. Columbine's primary employer is Lockheed-Martin, which Michael Moore visits during the film.  Other interesting people that Moore interviews include rock-star Marilyn Manson and Dick Clark.  Moore also uses a lot of archive footage of various people and events.
Michael Moore does present his case admirably for the causes of gun violence in the U.S. in ""Bowling for Columbine"", but sometimes his interviewing techniques are inappropriate and some of his information may be inaccurate.  Overall, however, because of the amount of information that Moore does provide that makes people think, I rate ""Bowling for Columbine"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  Not everyone who watches the documentary will agree with Michael Moore's conclusions or techniques, but the message about the amount of gun violence in the U.S. is something that cannot be ignored.  Hopefully, it will encourage adult gun owners to take all the necessary precautions for owning guns, and also encourage parents to make sure that they know what their children are doing, especially if the children have access to guns.",1078358400,5,2892,5.1956989247311824

In a lot of ways, I was already aware of the fact that guns in America are very prevalent in our society and culture but you won't believe how easy it was to actually buy the ammo for these things. Just watch the documentary and see for yourself at what I'm saying here.
 Another thing to look at is the dire gap between the rich and the poor, even between the upper and lower class workers in the same building. You got the story of an impoverished mother who worked two jobs just to make ends meet and even then she was in danger of losing her home because she could no longer afford it and would go for an 80 mile bus trip every day to work at a fancy Dick Clark restaurant and her son got a hold of the gun that was used in the shooting in Flint, Michigan a few years ago. I was absolutely heartbroken by the news of that. When I watched this, I lost all my respect for Dick Clark when seeing htis and it's absolutely a shame how so many rich guys just contribute almost nothing to less fortunate sectors of society although there are some exceptions.
 Michael Moore to me is a true hero in our society. He aims to expose the truth and go deep into the roots of such problems like our dangerous obsession with guns. Included in this documentary are footage of Moore with two COlumbine survivors one of whom lost the use of his legs and the other still has some bullets embedded within his body. It's really heartbreaking but it's true. I lost all my respect for Charlton Heston when seeing this too.
I'm not saying that I support the idea that they should get all guns away from citizens because I believe that we all have the right to bear arms but a part of me thinks that we have become a really violent society that is obsessed with guns and shoot-em-up games and gore.
 Go and see this documentary. It will piss you off, it will make you think hard but it will ultimately be a very rewarding watch as it delves deep beyond what news channels funnel into our minds.

 Michael Moore, you are great!",1078012800,13,2125,4.224137931034483
1837729,3,B00008DDVU,"These names will always be a wake-up call for the Americans - Dyland Klebold and Eric Harris.
Dyland and Eric are both students in the Columbine High School and on April the 20th, 1999, these two best friends decided to unleash the deadliest school shooting in the history of the United States. These two cronies mercilessly murdering 12 classmates indiscriminately and a teacher, before ending their lives together. What went wrong with these two seemingly normal high school kids?
In Michael Moore's Oscar winning best documentary, Bowling for Columbine,the director delved into the reasons behind the school shooting. Other facets the film explored are other prominent problems of the United States, such as America's obsession with guns, the increasing fear in US residents, and the many faults of the US government, mainly of the Bush entrepreneurs. Many might deem that Moore did a spectacular job in presenting the truth while supporting his logic with persuading evidence and facts. However, I believe in exactly the opposite.
Bowling for Columbine"" is not a documentary, it is absolute fiction. After viewing the film, I believe Moore purposely deceives and misleads his audience by supporting his view with biased and slanted deceptions to persuade and he deliberately hid the other point of views of the situations from the viewers.
Throughout the film, speeches, video clips, interviews and excerpts from TV programCOPS"" are shown. They may be strong and well-built proofs, but they can be edited and revised in order to support Moore.
For example, in order to back up his argument about African Americans are predominantly troublemakers and lawbreakers, Moore uses about 10 or more passages from COPS showing black people getting chased, hand-cuffed and arrested. As far as I know, there are also white criminals in the States too. This is an example of which Moore surreptitiously alters his information to cajole the viewers into his calculated trap.
The evidences that Moore collected was manipulated by him and therefore only supports one side of the arguments V his own.
According to an online dictionary, dictionary.com, the definition of a documentary ispresenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film.
By this definition,Bowling for Columbine,should not be viewed as a documentary, but as pure entertainment.
Moore also suggested in his film, that the media, by exaggerating crimes and murders, were climaxing the fear in the hearts of American citizens. However, with fortified information and manipulated editing, it is his so-called documentary,Bowling for Columbine,that is creating fear and doubt in the hearts of the viewers.",1077753600,10,2708,5.359154929577465

1837734,4,B00008DDVU,"Moore tries to provide answers to the question- what makes the U.S such a violent country? Before I go any further, just want to mention something to those who criticize Moore for not mentioning countries in Africa, South America, or Russia and the old Soviet bloc. We have to compare apples to apples here people. Compared to democratic, industrialized, developed -nations, the US ranks #1 in murder PER CAPITA. (though Moore doesn't mention per capita, only raw #'s). That being said, Moore points out that all the common scapegoats for violence (poverty, movies, video games, single mothers, gun ownership etc) exist in other democratic industrialized nations. So what is it? What makes the US so different? Moore points out the politics of fear. Media coverage concentrates on the negative. ""If it bleeds, it leads"" as the old saying goes. And our politicians in their demagoguery love to stoke our fears of crime. This does not happen as much in other countries. Therefore everyone has an inflated fear of crime. But that doesn't explain WHY crime rates are higher here (specifically, murder). Moore hints at it, but doesn't lay it flat out. So what is other major difference between the US and other modern countries????.............Give up? We are a world superpower (the first TRUE one as well). As a superpower, we use violence (war) or threat of violence and sanctions to secure our interests. I feel this message is subliminally planted into all of our heads, that violence is justified to get what you want, and the US has followed this model since the late 1940's. It ok to bomb other countries when we don't like the leaders that have been elected, or if they don't play ball with multi-national corporations. This mode of thought is so embedded into us, we don't even think twice. And god forbid someone points out the wrong in all of this. So we apply the same standards to our fellow US citizens and we would apply the citizens of the world. ""We don't like what you're doing, so I am going to hurt/kill you"". I may be way off base here, but it is the only difference I can think of that can cause such a difference in the levels of violence between the US and other countries. Moore also points out it all began with puritans being persecuted and afraid of the British government. But that kind of social turmoil has existed in other countries. Look at the reign of terror in France and the ensuing French revolution. The wacky French seem to have gotten over it. What about the Spanish inquisition? Wouldn't Spanish be permanently afraid as well? So Moore's argument that the colonists' fear of the British falls short. In the end, I think one must fall back on our actions on the world stage. As long as we condone the use of violence in our foreign policy, we will always have extraordinary levels of violence in our own streets.",1077062400,,2849,4.72289156626506

1837736,3,B00008DDVU,"The movie was entertaining, and I enjoyed Moore's style and humor.  Unfortunately, his argument is, I believe, flawed.

The movie begins and ends with accounts of two school shootings (one in Colorado and one in Michigan).  Moore uses these incidents to raise questions about (and provide possible answers to)the United State's staggering amount of gun violence.  However, the middle portion of the movie contains an examination of the way in which the media constucts an overarching sense of fear by focusing on and overplaying tales of homicides and other violent crime.

Taken together, these two points seem to cancel each other out: If the gun violence is bad enough to make a movie concerning its causes, then the criticism of the media isn't viable.  It would appear that the media are doing everyone a service in reporting a very real and growing problem.  However, if the criticism of media is justified, and the fear it engenders is a myth, then how are we to interpret Moore's accounts of school violence?  It would appear that he, in his presentation (the images of the shooters in the school, the 911 tape) and narration, is doing exactly what the media is criticized for doing.

The movie becomes more confusing with the presence of Barry Glassner, who wrote The Culture of Fear.  In the book, Glassner criticizes the media for focusing on anecdotal accounts of violence that play on our fears, and ignoring general trends (such as the fact that youth violence has been decreasing).  But anecdotal accounts are precisely what Moore uses to start and end his film, thus making it part of the general media trend that Moore himself criticizes.

The movie was entertaining, and I would recommend that others watch it.  In the end, I did not find his arguments very persuasive.",1076976000,4,1787,4.897009966777409

1837758,4,B00008DDVU,"""Bowling for Columbine"" is filmmaker Michael Moore's personal take on Guns In America.
The title - ""Bowling for Columbine"" - actually has double meaning here. First, don't be fooled into thinking that it's an accident having ""Columbine"" in the title. It's a catch word in our vernacular now. Choosen, rightfully so, to garner attention. And the ""Bowling"" is a reference to the fact that prior to killing their fellow students and a teacher at their Columbine High School in Colorado, the teenaged killers first attended thier morning bowling class.
Ultimately, this is a film about a lot of topics - the culture of violence in America, guns, television, the NRA, racism, and Mr. Moore's favorite subject - Corporate America. All these topics are explored in this very good film.
Michael Moore won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature with this movie. He gave a now infamous George Bush-Scathing acceptance speech and surprised absolutely no one by doing so.
However, ""Bowling For Columbine"" is not exactly a documentary. Not in the true sense of the genre. As in the past, Michael Moore's movies are a lot about Michael Moore. That is not necessarily a bad thing. I whole-heartedly recommend this feature. It's fun to watch, educational and thought provoking.
What it is not, in my opinion, is a documentary.
Basically, this film is an EDITORIAL about Guns In America.
Mr. Moore backs up his views with a lot of information, a lot of humor and a lot of insight. This film touches on a gamut of subjects, actually - Besides simply ""guns are bad"", he brings others topics to the proverbial table - Including racism, fear, and of course, Michael Moore's favorite topic, Corporate America. In this instance, he takes on K-Mart (in the past, his excellent film ""Roger & Me"" took on General Motors) and has a rather startling victory in doing so.
I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone, except perhaps the true documentary fan. For those people, I would be more apt to direct them to the very excellent ""Capturing The Friedmans"" and ""Brother's Keeper"".
Documentary filmmakers, those who truly embody the genre, seldom, if ever, make themselves part of the story. They follow a story and let it unfold, presenting itself to you. Michael Moore is the story, and he takes us along for the ride. That's the difference here.

1837761,5,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore, the American movie maker and author of many high-class books, released a documentation on school massacres and their causes in 2002. Although often criticized, this controversial movie  which is called ""Bowling for Columbine"" got rewarded as the best film in its genre at the Cannes Film Festival.
Moore does not only present real footage and interviews. He is also trying to make the American audience realize, why there is such an increase of violence in their society. By covering the aspects of gun control or political issues, Moore's intention is to mainly bring up the culture of fear, which is created nowadays. He also explains who or what keeps this culture preserved.
The movie basically is an enumeration of TV Ads for the NRA, speeches of politics, family members of the victims, and different communities in American villages, where took place. It is very clever to use pro and con strategies to leave the audience the decision what to believe. For example Moore uses crosscuts of Charleton Heston and a victim's father, both holding speeches.
While using professional editing of camera shots, he also managed it to accessorize the movie with special music, which allows the viewer's mood of irony to increase steadily. Armstrong's ""What a wonderful world"" is a leitmotif during the whole production and is usually shown during short cuts following one another very quick, showing war scenes.
Another important interview he presented, showed a conversation with the mostly feared rockstar Marilyn Manson.  He himself was one of the victims that was called guilty for influencing the boys from Columbine due to commit their brutal crime. Being a fan of him for a long time, it does not surprise me to see him stating his opinion in a decent way. I've always thought that he is a very intelligent individual.
When Moore talks about the media, he certainly is appealing to the modern culture of fear which is mostly created by TV channels, radio stations and of course the internet.
American news media shows 600% more negative material than it used to, although the crime rate is constantly decreasing. Therefore most people get scared easily, regardless what true statistics prove.
I personally liked the movie a lot and to me it was one of the best documentaries I've ever seen concerning usual documentaries only show what happened at the high schools and just a few, like Moore, try to figure out why school massacres happen or why American Society is so panic.  Without making it a real serious and depressing movie, Micheal Moore states his opinion and tries to make the audience realize how we could change things and to think about solutions for the issue. Although it was ""just"" a documentary, which usually is not my genre, I went through any emotion there is, while watching it. Sadness, fear, shock, fun, and the end impression I had was that Moore, the famous movie maker and author, allowed me to sympathize with his main opinion: We the people, and only us can change the cruelty that is taking over everywhere on this planet, 24/7. I share his point of view completely and state it once again by one of my most favorite quotes regarding society by Charles Horton Cooley :""Our individual lives cannot, generally, be works of art unless the social order is also.""",1076544000,5,3304,4.917562724014337

How can someone who proclaims such loyalty to progressive causes throw his support behind a former general who was the commander of the very war Michael Moore criticized as being a ""slaughter"".  He rightfully and harshly condemned the unilateral aggression of this country in Kosovo, but then praises and endorses the man who prosecuted it.  Not only is this hypocritical, but it clearly shows that money and fame have gone to his head.  He is now more concerned with supporting the Establishment candidates and could care less about whether that person has any true beliefs and convictions about core progressive causes.
He is all talk.  He backs up his talk by endorsing a candidate who admits he voted for republicans ranging from Nixon to Reagan to Bush Sr.  WTF??  Unless he can back up what he says with endorsements of people who are not in direct contradiction with what he claims are his core beliefs, then I have to conclude he is just milking us all for our money and patronage of his books and films at this point.
I will not buy any more of Michael Moore's works unless I am convinced he is not a fake.  If he was truly anti-war, he would not endorse a general who many consider to be a war criminal when there are so many other TRUE anti-war candidates who can win!  He is obviously trying to cash-in with US (the little people who buy his work) and climb the social ladder wtih THEM (the Establishment Elite who handpicks generals to run for president).

Why does Canada have more guns per capita than America, but far fewer murders? Why do they feel safe enough to keep there doors unlocked in a big multi-cultural city like Toronto?

1837793,1,B00008DDVU,"Well, where to start tearing into this load of garbage is the tough part. As many of my fellow reviewers pointed out, this film has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY. Mike plays with facts, mocks innocent working class people and basically produces a warped view of the history of American gun laws and the nature of random violence. Mike's not-so-subtle manipulation of images should be obvious to even the most casual film fan.
Moore never interviews criminologists, psychologists, or social workers on the topic of violence. Instead Moore turns to the air-headed Marilyn Manson for insight on the horror at Columbine. To interview experts would only get in the way of Mike's thesis which is : That anyone in America who disagrees with Michael Moore and his fans on gun control is a dumb, racist, violent hillbilly!  Moore focuses on the weirdest and most confused segment of pro-gun working class America and gleefuly exploits thier less than sophisticated language skills.  This approach comforts Moore's mostly educated and urban audience who will never even venture away from the cafe long enought to ever meet any of these ""primitive gun-lovin' hillbillys"". Gee, and I thought Moore was a workin' man's best friend.
Moore also not-so-cleverly attempts to convince his upscale fans that Canada is a wonderful fantasy land where violence is rare and people never lock thier doors. Canadians are portrayed as dull simpletons who don't have an aggressive bone in thier bodies. PLEASE! Just last month there was a major killfest in Toronto where 4 people were killed in separate shootings. These people were all killed with, yep, you guessed it, UNREGISTERED GUNS. Mr. Moore, I live in east end Toronto and I triple lock my doors.
One part that almost made me leave the theatre was the moronic cartoon about the "" history "" of violence in the U.S.. Talk about the oversimplification of complex social and political concepts! The Klan and NRA couldn't be farther apart politicaly! To blame ALL gun related violence ( even Black on Black violence) on some half-baked  racial theory is simply insane. Moore suggests that  violence, by some unexplained psychological process, is caused by white peoples envy and fear of African Americans. This cartoon segment did the most damage to Michael's already confused and juvenile argument.
What is even more shocking is that fans of this film don't for one second question the facts or Moore's motives. The cult of Moore is as fanatic and narrow minded as the militants and gun lovers that they hate so much. Moore works on and exploits the pliable minds of his  hysterical and paranoid audience and takes them on a journey through his psychotic and self-centred world view. Instead of producing a subtle and convincing documentary, Moore uses the language and entertaining style of the mass media that he claims to hate so much. This film is just a MTV, CNN, NBC or CBS style paranoia-fest that offers simple social commentary mixed with sensational footage. Moore shamelesly uses footage from the Columbine massacre in order to scare his audience into compliance with his twisted thesis.
I'm not a huge fan of assault rifles, nor do I support super right-wing corporate maniacs. This film is simply dishonest and ultimately fails to convince me of anything. (...)",1074038400,17,3310,5.021857923497268

Is America a nation of gun nuts or are they just nuts?  This is the question that the press release for Bowling for Columbine asks us and Michael Moore's new film goes some way in exploring.  Taking the Columbine High School shootings as its focal point, this documentary looks at the aftershock this massacre has had, paralleling it with the gun culture and increasing violence seen both within the States at a domestic level & the murderous events perpetrated by said country on a world level.
Review
Director, writer, celebrity, political activist, comedian; this is Michael Moore's first documentary film in 13 years since his debut Roger & Me, and it saw its premiere this Sunday as part of the Regus London Film Festival.
Since making his first film his political stunt style has developed through his television shows, The Awful Truth & TV Nation and his status as both celebrity and man of the people has been perpetuated through his written work: the most notable being his recent book Stupid White Men, which has been on the New York Times best seller list for over nine weeks!  This was despite his publishers best efforts to make sure it never saw a bookshelf let alone made money and is a testament to the strength of his work that it is now in its 19th printing.
So while Moore is obviously a draw, especially to a disillusioned youth or general public, why does Bowling work so well?  The answer is simple, it is honest film making - and his greatest tool is the truth which can be delivered in laugh out loud ""its so scary you have to laugh"" moments, which are equally surrounded by poignant seriously sad & intense segments that depict the awful state of affairs the States has found itself in.
From satirising American history through a farcical cartoon, that ironically makes sense, to looking at the FBI checklist of what is a potential teenage time bomb: Are you a depressed teenager?  Do you wear black, feel alienated, use inappropriate humour, abuse drugs or alcohol?  Any of that fit - maybe you could make some headlines next!  His humour is pure genius, and this is an entertaining film that doesn't feel dry and won't leave you looking at your watch!
This however is not a film that will purely get a ripple of laughter and fill some seats in a cinema, it forces its audience to question itself.  Indeed, it works well outside of the States as it makes you ask where our own country is going and how long will it be before we reach the level of public disturbance that is witnessed in the USA here.  In 1871, the KKK was made illegal, a few months later a new organisation was formed calling itself the National Rifle Association (NRA), its purpose was to promote gun ownership to whites only.  Until the 1950's the gun was used to keep so-called free blacks in their place, now it's the right of every citizen to carry arms.  America was once an open prairie of wild expanse, an individual needed then to protect themselves, some say that it is still wild but now a different sort of jungle.  Times change and Bowling for Columbine addresses the current `status quo' well, but it is up to the public address what is to be done today.
The Verdict
Creating a nice narrative progression that works well in a cinema - this film does seem to have an entertaining beginning middle and even a climax.  But being based in reality there is no end that can be said without being done and one man cannot do that alone.  It dares to ask questions that others have yet to put to a mainstream audience but in comparison to his written work, you feel that Moore is pulling his punches in order to make this product just that little bit more commercially appealing.  Nevertheless this is another fantastic film that should not be missed from the auteur that excels in exposing American absurdity.",1073520000,5,3818,4.594117647058823
1837795,5,B00008DDVU,"I expected this movie to be heavy in opinion but with a bit of Moore's usual fun.  I was greatly impressed that this movie did not spoon-feed answers.  It masterfully raised the serious questions about why the gun-violence in America is so great when in other nations, even those with lots of guns, it isn't.
I find people that are criticizing this movie largely seem to fall into the ""America ia great"" and if you point out our problems you must be anti-American.  I strongly disagree with this point and believe if we want to remain great, we need to ask ourselves the tough questions.  And this movie certainly does that.
I've found in other countries I've lived, it is common on nightly shows and media to look at national issues, discuss them intelligently with voices from ALL sides of the issue, and look at how other nations deal with the problem.  Sadly, that type of debate is very difficult to find in this country.  The media either keeps everything watered-down and middle-of-the-road, frequently only allows ""paid lobbyists"" to talk or you have a bunch of people screaming trying to ""score points"".
Buy this movie, share it with your friends and family, and talk about how we can fix this problem that is killing our children and our future.",1073433600,9,1255,4.707762557077626
1837796,4,B00008DDVU,"When Michael Moore asks Charlton Heston near the end of this documentary why there are so many more killings in the U. S. than practically anywhere else on earth, he responds at first by saying we have always been a nation of blood, a nation of violence. He then opines that it's because we are a nation of ""diverse ethnicity."" He had previously said in the interview that he keeps a loaded gun in his gated estate because of the Second Amendment and if it was good enough for the ""white"" men who founded this country, it's good enough for him. I believe that qualifies as undiluted racism. Moore interviews Heston and several others, some for and others against the easy access in this country to guns and ammunition. What I found amazing about this movie is that so many people spoke so openly when they knew they were being filmed. On the other hand, that's no more amazing than what ordinary Americans reveal about themselves on late night TV shows.
Moore asks  other hard questions--for example, about the welfare-to-work program that forces a single mother to travel 80 miles one way each day to work two minimum wage jobs that don't provide her with enough income to pay her rent. This is the same mom whose six-year-old son finds his uncle's gun, takes the gun to school in Flint, Michigan and shoots another six-year-old. Moore also takes on corporate greed, the news media's obsession with violent crimes as well as the zigzag approach the United States government has taken to various dictators over the years.
I do not know if seeing this movie will make people change their minds about guns and killing in this country or not. I do know that this documentary is very troubling.",1073347200,5,1690,4.671140939597316

1837809,5,B00008DDVU,"This is a fascinating and disturbing look at gun violence in the United States, using the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, as a starting point.  There are places where Moore's biases come through loud & clear, but at most points in the film, Moore creates questions rather than prescribes cures.  I was expecting a film-length pitch for gun control, but the film delivered something very different.  I'm not sure what Moore's thesis is -- but the question posed is why does the United States have such horrific statistics on shooting homicides?  The statistics are alarming -- our statistics are orders of magnitude greater than those of other developed countries.  According to the film, Canada, England, & Germany have virtually no gun homicides, while the US has over 11000 a year (and in Canada, about 70% of homes have a gun).  Moore doesn't give pat answers -- violence on TV, our propensity towward military intervention abroad, heightened coverage of violence in news media that creates a culture of fear, exposure to guns at a young age, the proximity of missile-producing Lockheed Martin to Columbine, poverty -- who knows why American society is so violent??  Apparently, the Columbine shooters were enrolled in a Bowling phys ed class & went bowling on the morning of the shootings -- Moore sarcastically questions why bowling isn't blamed as a cause of the shootings.  Moore even explores a situation in which a six-year old boy shot & killed a classmate at his elementary school in Michigan, leading him to interview bus passengers on the bus ridden by the young shooter's mother, leading in turn to a pointed criticism of Michigan's welfare to work program.
Much about this film is disturbing --  footage of the shootings at Columbine, footage of executions in US-sanctioned military and police actions throughout history made me squirm.  And I was very uncomfortable during Moore's confrontations with K-Mart (who sold the ammunication used at Columbine), Charlton Heston (for his visit to Denver with the NRA shortly after the Columbine shootings), and Dick Clark (whom moore attempted to interview because the six-year-old shooter's mother was employed at a Dick Clark's Bandstand restaurant under Michigan's welfare-to-work program -- seems to stray a little off point). Moore comes off looking slightly annoying, but the film is a real eye-opener and well worth seeing, regardless of your position on Moore, the Second Amendment, and gun ownership.",1073174400,5,2494,5.181592039800995
1837810,3,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore is indeed a controversial character these days.  Despite your individual political bent, Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine,"" is worth viewing, but when you go to feast on the anti-violence in America message, just be careful how much you swallow.
In this documentary Moore couches his message in a ""just under the surface"" manipulative way.  I watched his first flick, ""Roger and Me,"" and didn't walk away from it feeling that the message had been forcefully presented like in ""Bowling for Columbine.""  Though it has no bearing on the worthiness of this product, I would say I am in agreement with the message Moore is trying to convey here...America has proved itself a somewhat unhealthy violent society...and something needs to be done about our fascination and seemingly personal constitution claim to the holy grail of gun ownership.  However where I'm lost with Moore is the way he presents the message, heavy-handed and served up.
Here's what I mean.  Moore makes it a point to say that Columbine happened at the same time America was dropping the single-most amount of bombs on Kosovo.  He does this with footage of a KC-135...a non-bomb dropping refueler that is also utilized at times to carry humanitarian supplies.  I appreciate his saying that our willingness to wage war as a nation may translate in cases to personal violence, however the connection is tenuous at best.  War can be a regrettably necessary act.  Not many people would argue against the necessity of war in 1941 or in 1945.  Mahatmas Ghandi and India waged war (albeit non-violent) against Great Britain to end that occupation.  So, I feel Moore has mixed his messages of anti-war with anti-cultural violence and gun control.
Another heavy-handed approach is Moore's harassment of Charlton Heston, the figure-head of the NRA, who Moore quixotically enough is still a card-carrying member.  I disagree with the amount of power the NRA holds and agree with Moore that they are foolishly advocating for laws and rules that beget ease to obtain guns, but Moore's approach leaves even the more cool-headed liberals feeling somewhat sorry for Heston.  I don't think that was Moore's intent, but he has a history for confronting people in influential positions and making them look foolish.
The scenes of Columbine are indeed hard to watch.  It's funny that there is a thought through approach in directing and editing this film, that uses graphic images of violence and gun-killings to portray an anti-violent and anti-gun message.  England had a school shooting in the late 90's and enacted restrictive gun laws quickly and efficiently.  America could not even vote in a pro-gun control president in 2000 in the wake of repeated cases of school violence.
Moore's message needs to be heard.  There's a problem and something needs to be done about it.  But I question, his somewhat manipulated approach to conveying that message.  By all means, watch ""Bowling for Columbine,"" but be wary of what you swallow as truth.",1073174400,2,3001,5.050709939148073
1837811,5,B00008DDVU,"OK, again, this is still media that I am viewing.  Believing everything on TV is just sadly too common nowadays, yet irresistable.  I agree to some comments on here, that being a Canadian, it may not be as safe to live here in Canada as Moore portrays it.  But comparing to the USA, HELL YEA!  We may have tons of guns, but much less percentage of us actually use them just because we dislike someone, or the way someone drove on the highway.  There have been school shootings in Canada and Germany too..not only USA.  But to my knowledge so far, it seems like the Columbine incident was one of the major first 'role model incident' that has sparked such interests to the mentally sick and left out kids in high school, in which there were several school shootings following Columbine.  Of course, if reasons are these individuals were being bullied prior to such revengful incidents, the bullies should be taking the responsibility as well.
Anyhow...6 yr old with a gun?  Ok similar incident happened here in Canada too... but shootings and murders happen so often every day in the US, its not possible to keep track.  News only report locally.  Yes, USA has a much larger population than Canada..but even if you calculate the percentage, the US does still end up having a much higher average of annual murders or random shootings.
Oh yes, black people or other refugees who immigrated from less fortunate countries still have to work low wages, work their butts off...and still not being able to earn enough to support a small family.  Of course the states have enough money (or enough power to solve something)...but of course, it is never a priority.  Rich people are more prioritized.  Sure, government cutbacks happen everywhere...but it seems that even if the US is perfectly fine financially, they would prefer using money to build bombs and send troops (of foreign origins) to fight and die for a country they don't even have permission living in yet, only wished to.  And bribing such immigration-applicants to fight for the country in order to gain immigration status is not terrible enough?  There is so much wrong with the USA (as a whole), that it is sickening.  Of course, I HEARD from TV as well.  But it seems that I don't even need a DVD such as ""Bowling for Columbine"" to see where the US' attitude.  Bush's own words prove a lot already.  They can quickly point fingers at music stars like Marilyn Manson (which I read that the 2 Columbine murderers didn't even listen to, in the first place), yet they can NEVER blame their own media in which they depend on daily, such as CNN, movies.....and Bush.  Oh, power black-out...blame Canada first: Easy way out...save their own butts.
This is a great DVD for anyone who is curious why so many out there still hate ""America"" despite what happened in Sept. 11...and despite the ""Americanized"" lifestyles that we live happily with.  Some of you may find that not 100% of the contents are right, but then again, who & WHAT is perfect?  But it is definately good realization of what the world is dealing with.  There are terrorists out there...yet the US (Bush & the government of course, not all the citizens of course) are not responding in a correct enough way.

(but what did you expect from Michael) Boring, Boring, Boring... It wasn't even interesting or shocking. It was a long movie with horrible interviews and at one point has Michael  carrying on a crusade against K-Mart. K-MART??? Are you kidding me, who cares?

The documentary is incredibly fascinating, funny, scary, well researched, provocing and probably will leave you a little changed afterwards. As a great documentatary should and typical of Michael's style, it opens up questions rather than tells  answers. Hopefully there this creates more dialogue between Americans. We need to come up with the answers.
I live in Colorado, within 100 miles of Columbine so I am aware of many of the items that are documented.
As usual Michael put things in his documentary that are incredibly funny and entertaining as well as disturbing and thought provoking.
What he always does is document facts. A look at Michael's web site [...] documents proof of everyone of the items that the puppets from the Fox network, etc try to say are inaccurate. Yes, that bank does give away guns, yes Charlton Heston and his Rifle Association did what they did right after the deaths of those poor children as well as the trauma they suffered in Colorado. Really stuck it to those parents and students who were picketing for some respect and sensitivity to the victims. Not in the movie is the republican demonated Colorado state legislatures answer to Columbine. It was to post the ""Ten Commandents in every Colorado school"". By the way,  they are not accurate in their english interpetation, but that is besides the point.
Yes that quote about the ethnic mixing Charleton made was incredibly revealing.
Who the else has the courage to go to places and talk to people that he does.
What I found so wonderful about Michael's work is that he lets the words and the pictures stand on its own merit and his work always asks more questions than they answer. It is up to us, presented with information that we are not going to get from the U.S. media, or the research, or the people's direct words.
This one is not to be missed for ANYONE, and I hope political brainwashing will not keep people away. The movie, like all of his are meant to create dialogue, not tell you what to do.
He also is wonderful at getting people to talk in a very informal way about things and his humor, I mean his humor is seperates him from the rest.",1073001600,3,2370,4.708433734939759

Perhaps if he had accorded those of differing viewpoints some respect  and presented even one pro gun, anti gun control advocate that didn't seem like a complete nut job I would have thought this DVD was worth 5 stars.  Of course there is always the posibility that there aren't any logical pro gun people out there to interview.  A small voice in my liberal heart made me write that.

1837829,1,B00008DDVU,"I am not a gun owner, neither do I have strong personal feelings about the right to bear arms, but I know leftwing propaganda when I see it. That's the problem with so much of what liberals stand for today - they take such extreme positions in such a loud-mouthed way, they alienate most regular people. The war in Iraq is one huge example. Ordinary, patriotic Americans got so sick and tired of seeing the Martin Sheens and Susan Sarandons parading around and declaring their hatred for the Bush Administration, and the Dixie Chicks and Bruce Springsteens abusing their platform at music concerts to denounce President Bush when all that people wanted was for them to shut up and sing.
Michael Moore is another liberal idiot who has alienated much of mainstream America. Even many of his fellow liberal celebs were embarrassed at his little tirade at the Oscars, wanting him to shut up and hurry off the stage. Moore has a knack for distorting the truth, demeaning people and taking advantage of tragedy for his own despicable political agenda. Columbine is one example. There were parents of Columbine shooting victims who didn't want to speak to Moore, knowing his twisted motives. As the father of Rachel Scott said, ""Guns didn't kill my daughter, people killed my daughter."" With their motives, those two sick boys could have used any means to murder, maim and terrify.
A documentary would have been better spent analyzing the motives of children who want to kill their classmates. The easy access the Columbine killers had to firearms is scary for sure, and their parents should be held accountable. But to suggest guns are inherently evil and that ""gun control"" is the solution to America's bloodlust is missing the point. People were killing each other before guns were invented. There already are laws to control gun ownership. If the courts would do their job and honor the work the police do, we would be locking up many more illegal arms dealers, gangsters and drug dealers, thus making the average citizen feel safer and less inclined to buy a firearm for protection.

That being said, it isn't really a documentary. Webster's defines the term 'documentary' as ""presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film."" The problem with this film is that it does editorialize, since Moore himself is more the star of the movie than the people and events he is documenting. I happen to agree with much of what Moore is trying to convey, his stance on gun control, the culture of fear in America, the relatively low gun murder rates in other countries. But the way it is portrayed is so one-sided, that it is almost offensive as a viewer to watch such a subjective presentation of what is really a pretty sound argument. What becomes clear by the end of the movie is that the film is less a tribute to the victims of the Columbine tragedy, and more a launching pad for Moore's political agenda. Don't get me wrong, I found the film tremendously entertaining, but also a little insincere.
Also, Bowling for Columbine addresses almost too many different issues. From gun control, welfare reform, terrorism, American foreign policy, the NRA, the KKK, gang violence, Marilyn Manson and many other issues, Moore opens up so many cans of worms that one almost forgets what the film is about in the first place. Sure, each of these things are supposed to be linked to gun violence in America, but we never really find out how. For someone as opinionated as Moore, one would expect more answers and fewer questions.
It's shortcomings aside, the sheer substance contained in Bowling for Columbine makes it a must see. If you can get past Moore's biased presentation, you should really enjoy this film.",1072483200,2,1886,4.806153846153846
1837832,5,B00008DDVU,"I sobbed for 27 straight days after the Columbine massacre. I talked to my children, their friends, other parents, to strangers. I just wanted somebody to tell me how this could happen.  Instead of simply beating his breast with the rest of us Michael Moore hit the road with the same relentless outrage that brought the human tragedies of Flint, Michigan to living rooms across the country in ""Roger and Me."" In ""Bowling for Columbine"" Moore takes a breathtakingly painful subject, of which Columbine is representative, and places it firmly in the center of the lens. One by one Moore sets up theories about violence in America and neatly knocks them down again.
This is not a documentary for those who seek simple answers and handy villains. This is a study that charges into your psyche and rearranges notions about ""conservative"" and ""liberal;"" it rattles the foundation of what we perceive to be ""American ideals;"" and, at least in this viewers opinion, drops responsibility for the many tragedies represented by Columbine squarely in the vicinity of my own doorstep. I suspect that others will come away from this documentary, as I did, fundamentally altered in outlook. I wanted Moore to tell me who to point my finger at; I wanted him to tell me to point my finger at the people I had decided deserved it. In the end, the story he told had me looking for answers in my own heart and asking not ""What do YOU need to do?"" but ""What must I do?"" if our world is to change.
In true Moore fashion the sacred cows take most of the arrows. Michael Moore is at his best when he is letting his subjects hang themselves, and in ""Bowling for Columbine"" there is no shortage of people willing to do this.  The documentary gets awkward when Moore handles the rope.  The Japanese have a wonderful word, ""wabi."" An object's wabi is the flaw that makes it unique and valuable.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" has some ""wabi"" moments. Though deserving of the Oscar it received, it is not a perfect work. As a former journalist, I can understand how Moore fell into the trap of demonizing Charlton Heston simply because Heston was courteous enough to make himself available for demonization. That's unfortunate, because Heston isn't the issue - or even a good representative of the issue - and doesn't deserve the abundance of air time he was allotted.  Moore ambushed an elderly and ailing man in his own home (for God's sake, this is MOSES we're talking about), attempting to pin Heston to the wall for events in which Moore well knows Heston was, at best, a bit player. Including Heston's actions and statements within the NRA is instructive; the relentless focus on Heston is a lightening rod, and puts in jeopardy the larger purpose.
The ""K-Mart"" segment clearly demonstrates that somebody in that boardroom saw Roger and Me and realized there would have been no compelling hook if Roger had taken a half hour to talk to Moore.  K-Mart made the right decision for all the right reasons and slid under the ropes before Moore had the gloves on tight.  The anti-climax of the non-confrontation had Moore goofily giddy as he stumbled witlessly through a few shameless self-congratulatory minutes.  Unfortunately for Heston, K-Mart's capitulation apparently left Moore without a high card.
These awkward moments are the film's ""wabi"" - the flaws that make this work, and Moore as the master story-teller, human and personal.  These moments are counterbalanced with brilliant editing, heartbreaking and heart-uplifting stories told by simple story tellers, a sometimes startling view of how we Americans perceive ourselves and how we are perceived by others, and a well-knit, well-presented story.  Michael Moore is a master story-teller with a camera. His ""everyman"" demeanor is personal, unpolished and unerringly human.

1837833,3,B00008DDVU,"Americans have not seemed more politically polarized in my lifetime than now. It seems like all our current concerns have come to a boiling head. Over it all wafts the smoke of the World Trade Center.
This shadow hasn't blanketed controversy. We stir it in with everything that made us mad before. Some interesting works result.
Michael Moore's 2002 film *Bowling for Columbine* exemplifies the current mix of argument. Controversial in his own right, Moore examines modern American violence in a sort of cross-country adventure. And now his vision is available in a special edition DVD from MGM Home Entertainment.
Shine the Ball
MGM's release provides plenty of extra pieces to peruse. The transfer and sound brings justice to Moore's journey about the lack of justice. Special features include Moore criticizing Republicans for attacking former President Clinton instead of preventing the September 11th attacks. Viewers also get to hear people lower on the filmmaking ladder provide a commentary; Moore's interns mostly provide little stories like being locked inside Charlton Heston's estate. The case insert is your standard scene selection card.
Strike
Despite its titular reference to the 1999 Columbine High School tragedy, *Bowling for Columbine* is not about school shootings. And despite its byline, ""Are we a nation of gun nuts or are we just nuts?"", it's not about guns. Instead, Moore launches a methodical attack against corporate conceit and social inequity, which he repeatedly implies are the sources of violence in America.
True, Moore discusses guns in detail at first. For example, he interviews a relative of Timothy McVeigh about guns, and he examines not only the Columbine tragedy, but another infamous incident in Michigan, when a preschool boy shot a preschool girl. But Moore's gun interviews lead into an analysis of Canada, a nation with plenty of private firearms but a fraction of the violence. His Columbine interviews lead to discussion of the major defense industries located right in Littleton, Colorado. And his visit to Michigan concludes with a memorable confrontation with Dick Clark, one of several celebrities who use ""Welfare to Work"" for menial labor-including the mother of the aforementioned boy.
Moore's implied concern against corporations and conservative government continue with brief examinations of the September 11th terror attacks, America's own history of terrorism, and America's fear-instilling media. Moore breaks his theme only in the final five scenes, when he tacks on a dramatic but contradictory attack against guns.
Rules of the Game
*Bowling for Columbine* passes as a documentary. To me, a documentary is a visual research report. Documentaries provide information, but do not pass judgment and do not draw conclusions. The Vietnam War film *Hearts and Minds* exemplifies a great documentary.
Throughout most of *BfC*, Moore implies his opinions. He's obviously critical of conservatives, but he simply gives them rope to hang themselves.  But in the last 20 minutes of the film, Moore advances an explicit argument, a specific solution, and he passes out judgment like a cop passing out tickets on Memorial Day Weekend. These attributes convert Bowling for Columbine from an informative exposition to a persuasive-policy exposition, and the latter is not a documentary!
Gutter Shot
This doesn't spoil my enjoyment of *BfC*. Unfortunately, its ending does. After spending the film dealing in ambiguity and complexity, Moore suddenly decides that gun control is the answer after all. Besides contradicting much of his film, Moore's final Act befits tabloid journalism.
Moore parades Columbine survivors to pressure K-Mart into banning handgun ammunition from their inventory. The group even buys as much ammunition as they can, ostensibly so nobody else can get it. Once K-mart caves in, Moore tells reporters he is doing his part to reduce gun violence. This K-Mart scene suggests that targeting guns will reduce violence, contradicting his own point that nations like Canada are heavily armed but experience relatively low death rates.
It also explains why I couldn't buy ammunition when I was stationed in El Centro, CA. Kmart and Wal-Mart were the only game in town; I and every other police officer in the area had to scrounge for enough ammunition to properly train for our jobs. I don't know if banning ammunition from Kmart saved lives, but it sure interfered with civilian and federal law enforcement training.
After this segment, Moore confronts NRA president Charlton Heston in the film's climax. At first, Moore seems reasonable. Then he attacks Heston's pride with increasingly inflammatory questions. Heston walks out after Moore indirectly insults him. Moore pursues Heston and, in perhaps the most tactless scene of the movie, goads the aging president with a picture of the preschool shooting victim.
Finally, Moore concludes with an ominous implication of continued gun violence, playing right into the fear-based media he disparaged not an hour before.
I'm sure it's exciting to see the hip young liberal chase the mean old Republicans away. Such emotional provocations doubtlessly sealed Moore's Oscar award. To me, the K-Mart and Heston confrontations inflated Moore's reputation, while contradicting his own film and punishing non-criminals. The shock value of his climax might make his movie memorable, but also dishonest.
End Score
Moore's ambiguity had me in the palm of his hand for most of the film. I'm pleased he built his film on interview and news clips, showing instead of lecturing. Most of the film works, and it works best when Moore puts institutions on the spot.
But he lost his grip in the end, when he witnessed to the gun control choir. In doing so, Moore banks into the same gutter that traps most of America's post 9/11/01 media. He preaches a party-line and pushes others away.
*Bowling for Columbine* often strikes. But it will ultimately split people who should be working together. That Moore should slip like this so late in an otherwise excellent film is too frustrating to articulate.",1072224000,5,6100,5.295149638802889
1837834,3,B00008DDVU,"This film is an odd duck, even for a documentary.  It's equal parts farce, propaganda, amateur speculation, and over-the-top public spectacle.  It's also a film that goes no where in particular, other than to cynically manipulate and poke fun of its targets in ways that embellish, but don't always support, Michael Moore's meandering, undisciplined commentary.
And in the end, this film is about Michael Moore, more than anything else.  His hulking figure, and bitter persona, is the centerpiece.  If there was another thesis here, it was lost in all the rambling, in all the making sport of sad figures--like the aging, semi-incoherent Charlton Heston.
The ostensible theme is that Americans are too violent, especially teens who think nothing about bloody school rampages.  Okay.  What does Mr. Moore think?  He's all over the place. For example, from long, intermittant stretches, one would think that the availability of weapons and ammunition are the cause.  After all, Moore makes a spectacle of getting K-Mart to stop selling bullets.  But then, he marshalls compelling evidence that countries with far greater weapon ownership and availability--like Canada--have far lower violent crime rates, particularly with firearms. (Okay, so what was the point of the K-Mart exercise?)  This kind of sloppy thinking (and acting), coupled with an ending, smug tone of, ""Gosh, we don't know why Americans are so violent and stupid,"" is the film's consistent flaw.",1071964800,7,1460,5.336244541484716

Micheal Moore asks the impossible, ""Why are there more gun killings in the United States than in any other country?"" I was shocked to see the scene in the movie where they showed several countries and the amount of people killed by guns each ear comparing to to the United States' number which was in the 11 thousands, a much vast difference from the other countries. He also explored Canada, our nieghbor in the South and noticed that noone locks there doors at night even in the city. It makes him ponder, why? Why is America bieng driven by fear and paranoi; one answer is the image the news are presenting. An excellent piece of filmmaking Moore explores a subject not seen in many movies and the footage from Columbine security cameras was haunting. The ending was fantastic with the final interview with Charles Heston, Moore grips his sense back to reality and asks why the hell did he do pro-gun ralleys immeadiatly after Columbine and the 6-year-old girl who got shot. Heston walked right out of the interview shying away from answering common sense. This movie flowed perfectly and I hope to see more work from Moore as compelling as this was.",1071878400,2,1288,4.728888888888889
1837836,4,B00008DDVU,"It is unfortunate that a film like this was made. Not that I didn't like it because I did. But because there's a chord that this documentary struck that seemed to set Americans (and maybe others) against each other. Some have called this a ""fictional documentary"", or tried to blast it for being unpatriotic or anti-gun. Other's have said that it's an instant American classic that speaks volumes about the current psychology of the masses in the USA. I'm kind of in the middle. . .
The film--as the title suggests--focuses primarily on the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado; two teenagers barging into classrooms and the cafeteria, killing any who got in their way. Michael Moore (the star, narrator, director and producer) doesn't say ""These boys had guns and if they didn't have them those poor kids at Columbine would still be alive today."" What he DOES say is that there's an inherent fear factor that has oozed into the American mainstream and invaded our homes. And this fear has spilled over to our kids as they see us go off to work for companies that build missiles (""For Defense""), handguns, semi-automatic weapons, and fully automatic weapons (""For Home Defense""), and security features for our homes (""Burglar Alarms and New Locks""). Mr. Moore also shows us that Canadians don't seem to have as much of a problem as their southern neighbor. Canadians don't lock their doors, or focus on shootings on CNN, or run out to buy a gun every time something bad happens in their area.
Why is that?
This documentary opens up new dialogue for parents raising teens, I think. And it should open up their own minds, making them wonder why they have to ""defend"" themselves so fervently from the unknown.
I have a unique insight into school shootings, as I was a paramedic for many years and was in one of the first ambulances to arrive at the Cleveland School shooting in Stockton, California. 35 elementary school children were hit by bullets from an AK-47 rifle. A horrible sight that I never wish to see again, and that I sometimes still dream about (believe me, you don't want these nightmares). Even after witnessing this horror and seeing the gun laying on the ground near Mr. Purdy's body (the shooter), I still believe that Americans have the right to ""bare arms."" But not AK-47's and the like.  Let's stop this kind of nonsense and look at WHY we feel we need weapons like this in the first place.

'Whose fault is it, if the Americans are just a bunch of crazy cowboys?' Moore seems to ask in his film, edited like a documentary as well as an investigation. The fault of the whole political class, which since the end of World War II (and the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan) has been organizing illegal and bloody invasions and destitutions all over the (third) world, financing and giving weapons to dictators and terrorists, sending out bombs and missiles everywhere? Of the medias, which permanently keeps on an atmosphere of fear, suspicion and hate through violent and bloody pictures broadcasted daily, in TV news and shows, with an obvious commercial purpose? Of the huge poverty which hits mainly the Black people, who - as well as some hard rockers with weird figures and shapes, like Marilyn Manson - are put on an evil level in order to be used as guilty ones every time something wrong happens?
From the supermarket of guns to the bank which gives a rifle as a gift when an account is opened, through an exhilarating cartoon in the ""South Park"" style, resuming in a few minutes the history of America, based upon fear, ignorance of the other in front and blood, the interviews of some teenagers at school, all familiar with guns and bombs, of some adult 'gun nuts' (including James Nichols, the brother of Terry, one of the two people who destroyed a building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people - he sleeps with a 44 Magnum under his pillow!), who consider the carrying of guns as a duty and a responsibility as an American, and of a disgusting Charlton Heston, who used to play Moses in ""The Ten Commandments"" (THOU SHALT NOT KILL), and who's now the president of the NRA (National Rifle Association) which still keeps encouraging the free market of fire guns all over the country -, Michael Moore, within only two hours, manages to tell with strength and an undeniable humor about all the more serious problems in the so-called land of free and the result is an astounding shocker, a great demonstration of the American paranoia, the admittance of powerlessness of a whole manipulated country.

Now, however, I'm a little wiser and more skeptical.  People who haven't visited and read the site bowlingfortruth.com are being duped by this film-making mastermind.  Almost every topic or incident in the film contains manipulations and misleading (sometimes even flat out FALSE) information.
Off the top of my head, I can tell you that:
- the interview with Charleton Heston was heavily edited, and the details of the NRA rallies are not given full and proper explanation; Heston is not at all the bad guy Moore makes him out to be
- Kayla Rolland's 6-year-old killer was violent in school almost everyday, and the uncle's house he had been abandoned at and where he found the gun was actually a 'crack house' (among other omitted facts this segment should have featured)
- the cartoon segment, giving a brief history of the USA's colonization and the founding of the NRA, is remarkably misleading
The fact that I came away from the movie, initially, moved and entertained says a lot for Michael Moore's movie-making abilities and infectious underdog enthusiasm.

1837862,4,B00008DDVU,"Documentaries are probably the hardest types of film to review, primarily because it all comes down to whether or not you agree with the filmmaker or not. Style helps, but you can't recommend a documentary you disagree with, can you?
To come out with the truth before I get too far into this review, I will say that I totally disagree with Michael Moore on almost all subjects. To call him a liberal is an understatement -- so from a Republican's standpoint, it's very hard to give his film a good rating.
""Bowling for Columbine,"" like most of Moore's films, is seriously flawed. He presents a lot of information as truth when it is clearly not so. As entertaining as the History of the US cartoon was, it was also quite incorrect in many ways, and guess what -- killer bees DID come to America through Texas, even though he states that they never did.
He doesn't bash the Bush administration as much as I thought he would, or any real political issues. He basically bashes American culture for allowing guns to flow so freely into the grasps of criminals and children.
Moore is a lifetime member of the NRA, but he thinks guns should be handled with more caution. America has the highest rate of weapon-related deaths in all the world, and as this documentary shows, Britain, Canada, and other closely related countries have the exact same films, videogames, weapons, and so on. Why is America's gun crime so high?
The film is centered on the Columbine shooting a few years back, when two students walked into Columbine high school and shot students, killing and injuring a large number of innocents. It was a wake up call for most of America, and Moore's real point of the documentary is to explore the reason America is so obsessed with guns.
From a critical standpoint, the documentary is well made, probably deserving of its Oscar. It's touching and funny, disturbing and outrageous. Sometimes it's a bit too politically correct -- the whole exploration of African-Americans getting arrested more than Caucasians on the television show ""COPS"" is not only incorrect but sort of a laughable attempt on Moore's part to gain the respect of black viewers. I've watched ""COPS"" before, and a lot of white guys get arrested -- I can think of many arrests off the top of my head. I don't think that it's a valid point at all. America's reported fear of blacks is not why there are more shootings.
Two survivors of the Columbine massacre accompany Moore towards the end of the film when he visits the Wal-Mart headquarters and requests that they stop selling 30-cent weapon ammunition -- the same ammunition bought by the Columbine shooters. Wal-Mart agrees, which is why you will no longer see gun ammo in Wal-Marts across the country.
When ""Halloween"" came out in 1978, the six-year-old killer, Michael Myers, seemed even more evil and scary because he murdered at such a young age. Nobody thought that there could be a child like that. But, in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" we are informed that a six-year-old school kid shot another young girl of the same age in a school cafeteria one day -- by accident, or so they say. That's when the documentary starts to become a horror film as opposed to an informative film. And it's better for it, too.
It is our right as Americans to decide whether or not we should carry guns. I think the restrictions on letting guns fall into the wrong hands could be a bit more strict, but the criminals on the street will achieve weapons irregardless of whether or not Wal-Mart stops selling hunting rifles. In that sense, Moore's documentary is almost pointless. By the end, he never reveals why America is infatuated with guns. But his unresolved insight into why our nature is so influenced by violence is the highlight, and the remaining image of the little girl shot to death by a six-year-old boy will stay with you for a long, long time.
Another problem with documentaries is that they can be twisted around and edited into whatever the filmmaker wants -- such as Moore's interview with Charleston Heston at the end of the film, or Dick Clark's refusal to speak to Moore, and so on and so forth. We don't know the background story on these things and we don't know what else was said before Moore fiddled around with the footage and crafted it into what he wanted. Splice together images of Heston saying, ""From my cold dead hands!"" and anything can look bad.
""Bowling for Columbine"" is a very good film, and though I do not respect Michael Moore in any way, even I have to admit that he's made a good -- if flawed -- documentary about violence in America. He handles the content with care -- the way it should be handled -- and it can be both hilarious and saddening at the same time. I don't agree with everything in this film, but some of the real facts are pretty haunting. It's definitely one to check out.",1070928000,3,4843,4.639115250291036

1837864,5,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine angered a lot of people, and with good reason. Michael Moore wanders into a dozen different places to talk to a variety of people about guns. Why do Americans kill each other so much, he asks? The film builds steadily to a sensible conclusion: We're scared.
Whether he's talking to the father of a teenager killed at Columbine, Marilyn Manson, Charlton Heston, or a schoolteacher in Michigan, the same themes return: Fear, consumerism, racist scapegoating, and mixed messages about guns and violence. As Marilyn Manson says, ""Keep them scared and keep them buying stuff. It's a cycle."" The mixed messages come in the form of overseas bombing by the US military and weapon-building at Lockheed Martin. (The Lockheed Martin plant made nuclear missiles but, by the time the documentary was shot, the missiles were converted to peacetime use to launch satellites. Then again, those satellites are part of the US military, so the point Moore makes in the missile plant still makes sense.)
These themes are not wrapped up at the end into a final, definitive answer. Moore is smart enough to leave the issue open-ended. This film is the beginning of the story, not the end.
The extras on this DVD are not necessary --- the documentary stands on its own, as Moore says in the introduction --- but they add a lot of worthwhile commentary. One of the best parts is the interview on the Charlie Rose show, where Moore makes a strong case against the Bush administration, the invasion of Iraq, and the so-called war against terrorism. This feels like a teaser to his next film. His 15-minute talk about his Oscar speech is also very good. Instead of showing the speech, he sits at a picnic table in someone's yard, holding the Oscar statue as he explains what happened and what he said. These extra pieces add a lot to an already brilliant documentary. I highly recommend it.",1070755200,2,1885,4.803076923076923

Lying about being a member of the NRA to get an appointment in order to play ""tricks"" on Charlton Heston in an attempt to humiliate one of America's best actors is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a ""noble cause"".

1837889,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore's latest is engaging cinema, to say the least. His sarcastic, ultra-liberal approach to ""the awful truths"" of America have never been so entertaining. It's a cross between Candid Camera and 60 Minutes.
This time, he confronts the gun-culture of America. He highlights the fact that Charleton Heston and his merry band of pro-gun extremists held a rally near Columbine shortly after the tragedy there. Then, he and his ilk held ANOTHER gun-rally shortly after another child/gun tragedy in Flint, MI where a 6-year old child shot and killed a 6-year old classmate (Heston claims in the final interview of the film that he didn't know this had just happened when he appeared in Flint). Heston really shines when he claims that the reason for all of the violence in America is due to ""mixed ethnicity"". This statement is almost as jaw-dropping as Bob Eubanks' anti-semetic joke in Moore's debut, ""Roger & Me"", unless of course, you are a bigot.
Also interviewed, and similarly pathetic, is James Nichols, brother of Terry Nichols and friend of Timothy McVeigh, both convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing. James, of course, is pro-gun, but doesn't believe the right to bear arms includes nuclear weapons (""There are a lot of nuts out there,"" he claims, to the howling delight of the audience).
Marilyn Manson pops up also, commenting on how he was also blamed for Columbine because the idiots that killed at Columbine listened to his music.
Another highlight is when Michael invites two Columbine survivors to join him at the K-mart headquarters in Troy, MI, to ""return the bullets"" that are still embedded in their flesh from the Columbine attack (reportedly purchased from the local K-mart). This stunt results in K-mart's announcement that they will be pulling ammunition off of their shelves, to Moore's own astonishment.
Although there is a lot of serious business in the movie, it is packaged with enough laugh-out-loud footage to make it bearable, even entertaining, even in light of the constant barrage of violence played out on nightly newscasts.
The only major downside is Moore's lack of thoroughness in certain areas. For instance, he claims Canada has as many guns as we do in America, and therefore the death-by-gun rate should be the same (of course Canada has FAR fewer gun-related deaths than the U.S.). However, Canada bans handgun ownership. This is not pointed out.
Also, he tries to blame Michigan's ""Welfare to Work"" program for the classroom shooting of the 6-year old child, his claim being that because the mother of the shooter had to work far from home (via bussing), she had to leave her children in the care of her brother, who owned the gun that the child found and brought to school. This is a stretch, as when he also blames General Motors for this tragedy, inferring that it was because GM ruined Flint, MI that this tragedy occured. These tangents, although interesting, often seem somewhat scattershot.

""Bowling for Columbine"" is, among other things, quite enjoyable. Moore has grown considerably as a filmmaker, and here he shows a keen eye for pacing and indulging his viewers' sense of mystery. For the most part, he also manages to counterbalance the need for moving and amusing the audience with the danger of making light of a very serious matter. If you want to spend two hours thinking about dark, politically-charged subjects in an entertaining manner, this movie will do the trick.
However, Moore remains prone to all of his old, annoying habits. Self-righteous sarcasm? Got it. Manipulative, callous grandstanding? Got it. Playing fast and loose with the facts? Yes -- but it could be worse.
What ""Bowling for Columbine"" does best is bury most or all of the ""single-answer"" explanations for American gun violence. Over the course of the film Moore explores many of the typical, and not-so-typical, scapegoats. These include gun makers, race relations, Hollywood depravations, paranoid minutemen, video game violence, the news media, the NRA, our unravelling social safety nets, and Marilyn Manson -- but no one cause ever stands out as central. The movie makes a very strong, though understated, case that the true root of gun violence is the social and economic breakdown of American communities, and that only by developing a more vibrantly interreliant and nurturing society will we be able to turn the tide of that breakdown.
Unfortunately, though every piece of evidence points Moore towards that conclusion, in the end he throws his anti-gun allies a bone and goes after gunmakers and the NRA with both barrels blazing. It's ironic, because while both those villains certainly have blood on their hands, Moore's partisan tactics reveal him to be as enmeshed in our violent culture as those he would demonize. Welcome to America, old buddy. Maybe we can shoot our way out.",1070150400,3,2031,5.011834319526627

 ""Bowling is fiction. It makes its points by deceiving and by misleading the viewer. Statements are made which are false. Moore leads the reader to draw inferences which he must have known were wrong. Indeed, even speeches shown on screen are heavily edited, so that sentences are assembled in the speaker's voice, but which were not sentences he uttered. Bowling uses deception as its primary tool of persuasion and effect.""

1837893,4,B00008DDVU,"I am huge fan of Micheal Moore and his work.  His documentary's always seem to hit home.  I really like what he is trying to portray in this documentary and the fact that Americans have to start taking more responisibility for there gun problems. One of my problems with this film is how it only shows one side of every argument.  When done in film this is very effective in swaying you towards a side of an argument.  I also had a problem with how they portrayed Canada in this documentary.  I visit Toronto regulary and the ghetto's portrayed in the film looked like a nice suburb and not what is truly going on in Toronto.  This point is even more driven home with the recent gun slayings in Scarborough in the month of November 2003.
Just to restate my point this movie is an excellent documentary, and it does address some major issues with society today.  I highly recomend to watch this film but also think about the perspective that its done and make your own decisions",1069718400,,977,4.455056179775281
1837894,5,B00008DDVU,"Well, as far as all the five star ratings go, I don't think that I can add too much to what's already been said.  Moore raises more questions than he provides answers to, which was his point.  Why DON'T they have the kind of homicide rate in Canada that we do, when there are seven million guns in ten million homes up there?
If you draw you own conclusions though, you can see his point.  It totally IS the media.  I don't mean video games, Hollywood bloodbaths, and Marilyn Manson (which Moore points out are just as frequently devoured in Canada and elsewhere).  I'm talking about the NEWS.  Government propaganda and how the news media puts a spin on it.  I think that we as human beings can differentiate between a violent video game and real violence.  It's called human intelligence.  But when all we hear on the news is tragedy after tragedy after tradgedy, we come to believe our neighborhoods and towns are more dangerous than they really are.  That breeds fear, which breeds violence, which breeds more fear, and the vicious cycle keeps going on and on.  THIS is Moore's theme not just in the Canada section, but throughout the film.
Here's another interesting point.  Michael points out that the U.S. is capitalist in the extreme.  I used to be undecided on nationalized health care, but now I support it.  I originally bought in to Jesse Ventura's argument against nationalized health care, which is that when you only get one provider, you get corruption.  However, I've changed my mind on that.  Nationalized health care works in every other 1st-world, freeworld country: the UK, Canada, Spain, France, Germany... We're essentially a society that says, ""If you can bust through college and work your way into the white-collar sector and land a job with a Fortune 500 corporation, THEN you've earned the right to not have to worry about health care.""
Moore suggests, and I agree, that it's that kind of Darwinist, survival-of-the-fittest mentality about our country that causes people to snap and commit carnage.
Outstanding work.  Every American, heck every human, needs to view this one.
PS Though I disagree with Jesse Ventura on healthcare, he is another one of my social heroes, after reading his book ""Do I Stand Alone?""  Check out my review of that book.",1069632000,10,2275,4.804627249357327
1837895,5,B00008DDVU,"I never thought I would see an American documentary of this sort.
 Michael Moore's sense of sarcasm and deep narrative analyzed the United States at several layers. Why are the States such a violent country?  Why do they keep killing each other in their own schools?
 These questions are handled with a lot of dark humor at the time of criticizing the States foreign policy and domestic attitude of shoot first and blame anything else later.
 It felt good watching an American who thinks deeply and cared about his country enough to film this commentary that makes people cry (very strong moments) and laugh (Moore's dark humor when criticizing some ridiculous things in that society).
 Perhaps what I most admired about Michael Moore was his courage. He dared question his current government administration and his country's violent attitude towards the rest of the world. The problem of fear controlling peoples lives and using it to manipulate and make them buy and avoid questioning reality.
 The pathetic and tragic cases of Columbine High and that 6 year old girl are things that lets hope never happen again.
 The NRA and the Bush Administration should thing a little more before they act. The ignorance shown by Mr. Heston and some other few made me mad. Because of them, innocents pay the price of their &#8220;freedom for guns loaded all over to keep them apparently safe and radical ideas for handling situations&#8221;
 This film really makes you think.
 The DVD has nice features like a conference at the University of Denver and some speeches at international Festivals including Toronto Film Critics Association Awards and the Cannes Film Festival.

Number of gun deaths per year per country:Germany:381 France:255 Canada:165 UK:68 Austrailia:65 Japan:39 and the US:11127. a bit shocking, right? also, charlton heston had the nerve to vist littleton the month after the columbine shooting, and visted flint the week after the youngest school shooing of a 6 year old to hold pro gun rallies. he was speechless when moore asked him why he chose those places at those difficult times. moore left a picture of the slain girl, Kayla Rollands, at hestons door. this movie should not be missed. it had me debating with my friends of gun control at 8th grade lunch and protesting the use of toy guns on an elementary school playground. it will completely change the way you think",1069200000,6,1330,4.43265306122449

Moore misrepresented facts, and spliceed together interviews to make is opponants seem cold-blooded and mean. Throught the film he preaches in such a sickiningly self-righteous mannner that i as liberal and registered Democrat(someone Moore was aiming the picture towards, i imagine) was sickened by his tone. Moore fails to take his opponants seriiously instead he mocks them, and smugly tells us his ""facts"". Moore mentions that Canada, the U.K. and Germany have lower gun-related deaths than we do, he grouped all deaths together, leaving out self-defense, accidents and suicides, which are not murders. The fact that Moore blamed the Work-for welfare for the tragedy in Flint, Michigan, shows how Moore disregards other factors, that have contributed to the tragidies, and instead consentrates on things that are perhaps remotely responsible. We should have sticter gun laws, yes, but a piece of biased trash like this hurts the gun-control supporters. Watching Moore exploit the tragedies in Flint and columbine is sickening, almost as sickening as his being rewarded with an oscar for this ""film"". Watching Moore constantly state the number of gun related deths reminde me of a dialouge in All in the family, this may not be a totally accurate script of the exchange as iam going from memory.

1837909,1,B00008DDVU,"It would be giving Michael Moore too much credit to say that this is a dangerous film.  But in fact it is, but not for the reasons M.M. would like it to be.  Weaving a thread of personal bias through the documentary format is more corrupt than any elected politician could ever get away with.  I was also upset by the fact that he used a bate and switch tactic in that he used the publicity of the Columbine tradgedy as a spring board for his real agenda, gun control.  Removing the pumphandle from the well will not stop the spread cholera nor will gun control remove the spread the violent use of guns.  The problem is still in the ground.
The fact that M.M. received an academy award for this effort is even more distressing in that people are more impressed by entertainment than the honest and credible evaluation of social issues challenging American culture.
For a more credible evaluation of the Columbine tradgedy see psychologist Elliot Aronsen's book ""Nobody Left to Hate.""",1069113600,16,984,4.632183908045977

Some of the other political comment however, comes over as far less wholesome. In particular, the ""what a wonderful world"" montage cumulating with the 9/11 atrocity seemed calculated to suggest to the viewer that the US only had itself to blame for the attacks.

This shows why those stereotypes exist, this shows why people hate America, this shows the extent of media and big business's affect on the general public, this shows backroom dealing and cover ups in the US government...but more importantly it shows that the US Constitutional right to own a gun, is not just hypocritical, but causing the deaths of thousands of people a year through neglect of an ancient privaledge that is out of date in this modern society. It shows Michael Moore expanding on his book ""Stupid White Men"" (a MUST read), showing in a brief summary of American history how the White mans quest for superiority caused a disgraceful aspect of the US constitution to be formed, an the very aspect that causes approximately 11,500 deaths, every year. It shows the differences between the US and other democratic western countries and it enters into the disgraceful exploitation that is being used by big business's such as Lockheed Martin who are benefiting off the media putting fear into the publics heads. It raises the issues of 9/11, the Bush and Clinton offices. But most importantly, it shows how ineffective government policies can affect a family so much, that a young boy of 6 yrs old ends up murdering a school mate. It enters into gun crime in school, and gun culture in teens. It enters into the Columbine tragedy and the dispicable rallies of the NRA after major gun crime incidents. And shows Charlton Heston...a front runner of the NRA, being questioned ruthlessly by Moore on his actions after Flint and Columbine. This documentary is a masterpiece. It is moving, thought provoking, funny in many parts, digestable and gives a true representation, of the corruption that is 21st century America.",1069027200,3,1952,4.864864864864865
1837912,3,B00008DDVU,"As a fairly liberal person, but also a reasoning one, I have to say that I agree with some previous reviewers who state that this movie is high on style and light on facts. Moore makes a number of great points in this movie, and then fails to exploit them, opting instead for sure-fire propaganda such as the climactic and uncomfortable interview of Charlton Heston.
The most glaring example of this happens a good way into the movie, when Moore is focusing on Canada, and their higher per-capita gun ownership, in comparison to the US. There is a moment where we see a shot of a Canadian news anchor on a television in a bar, dryly reporting dry news. Moore mentions something about the very civilized Canadian news coverage, a stark contrast to US-style, ""If it bleeds it leads"" reporting.
Once he's done pointing out this contrast, Moore spends the rest of the picture ignoring the media's role in the subject he's purportedly trying to get to the bottom of. Is there NO ONE who sees the importance of the media to the public attitude? It's almost as if Moore longs to be a ""credible journalist"" himself, and doesn't want to upset anyone in a position to hand it to him. If this movie really wanted to create some answers instead of more questions, it should have been pointed squarely at the mainstream media. Could the influence of 24-hour-a-day war, crime, sex scandal and the resulting drone of pundit ""analysis"" have ANYTHING to do with the darkening of the US ""Group Mind""? Only a tiny little bit in Moore's world, it seems.
I think this movie is best viewed not as a documentary OR a propaganda piece, but instead as sort of left-slanted comedy. I don't for one moment want to give the impression that I hated this movie...as I said, I'm pretty liberal, and it produced plenty of belly laughs, while making some great points about the state of our society. But to be so, so close to seeing the keelhauling of the national media, and then to have it slip away, is frankly painful.

1837936,1,B00008DDVU,"Having sat through two screenings of this film, I can only conclude that Michael Moore so thoroughly hates himself, or perhaps where he comes from, that his only form of catharsis is to subject his viewing audience to endless tirades against gun owners, white people, Republicans, and President Bush in particular.  And while I do not dispute the man's right to hold whatever opinions he wants, I think this film is filled with many factual errors, baseless and politically-motivated assertions, and does not in fact deserve the title of 'documentary'.  Rather, it's a propoganda piece, a kind of cinematic grinding axe, wherein Moore launches into soft-spoken yet clearly enraged tirades against a range of targets, capping it all off with an ambush on Charlton Heston.  Balance?  Dispassion?  Critical analysis?  What are those?  Moore doesn't seem to know, nor does he seem to care.  I recommend this film for all capital 'L' Leftists, who will surely adore it because it basically says nothing they haven't been saying for a long time anyway.  The rest of us who live in reality have better things to do with our time than let Moore occupy it with his films.
Oh yes.  Since Moore seems so certain that the television program ""COPS"" is a giant KKK rally against African Americans, how come when I see ""COPS"" the police are always busting white trash in trailer parks?

1837940,5,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore asks some serious questions.  Why does the United States have so many murders compared to other westernized, modern and developed countries?  Those countries don't have the poverty we do, they don't watch or play or listen to the violence we enjoy or other reasons shelved out to respond to the epidemic of gun violence in this country.  Moore takes all those arguements and effectively contradicts them with well-thought out counter-arguements.  He focuses on two infamous acts of gun violence: the Columbine shootings and the shooting of a six year-old girl by a class-mate that occurred in Flint, Michigan as examples.  It is extremely easy to get the guns used in these shootings and even easier to buy the ammo, Moore points out.  At K-Mart, one can buy ammo at any age with no i.d.  But the film does not focus the bulk of its time on Moores' inheritantly liberal standings (the film features a scathing cartoon that satires the history of white people in America, and Moore unfortunatly skewers a couple facts for more liberal effect), but far more on the issue at hand.  The Columbine shooting was done by two boys who played violent video games, listen to violence ridden music and watched violent t.v. and movies.  But Moore points out that many other developed countries watch the same movies, listen to the same music and play the same video games.  Japan, the global epicenter of violent video games has less than one hundred murders a year.  Many European countries watch the same movies and listen to the same music we do, but their combine murder rate for a year is serveral thousands less than America.  The Flint shooting was done by and African-American child.  But people of African heritage live all around the world.  Canada has the same percentage of African- American population that we do, but their murder rate is no more than a hundred a year.  So why does America have so many more murders that the rest of the developed, modern world (somewhere around an alarming 11,000, 11,000 a year)?  Without giving away too much, Moore hypothesises that the reasons are socital and the media.  We have always been brought up with you have the right to own a gun and that you have the right to use it .  Also, look at the news the next time you see it...how much time is spent on covering the negative side of human nature and crime.  It may surprise you.

It's important to remember, watching it, that this is not a subjective documentary, but a film that makes a very deliberate and intentional point, just like Mike Moore's previous, smaller scale enterprises. But aside from tackling some incredibly important issues, and bringing to light some fascinating obscure information, Bowling for Columbine should be noted for being one of the finest, most powerful pieces of propaganda ever seen. That's what it is, after all - propaganda, though it supports very positive and respectable causes. Mr. Moore is a master filmmaker, who does a fantastic, wonderful work of making his point and making his viewers care about it. The music, the monologue, the animation sequences and the archive footage are all combined with the interviews (fascinating interviews with Marilyn Manson, Charlton Heston and Matt Stone, among others) to create a powerful and intense ninety minutes that would keep your eyes glued to the screen like few other documentaries could.

There are moments in this movie where I laughed out loud, and others where I cringed as Moore displayed his favorite approach to getting a response out of people, by causing a scene at their home or workplace.
All these basic emotions aside, though, this movie makes it a point not to put the blame on any one person or corporation, but on all of us, for the state of our society. While moments of the film are bound to be controversial (What Moore film wouldn't have these) the whole point of it is to force your perspective away from the single screen view of the World as provided by your local or network news agency.
Does he take advantage of poetic license at times, of course. He's not making a foundation for his viewpoints, just adding conversational points to his open discussion. Not once throughout the movie does he say, ""This is why things are messed up, it's his/her/their fault."" Instead he presents ideas and lets you link them together.
I buy movies made by Moore because somehow he puts a powerful idea in your head while he's making you laugh at his antics. And regardless of politics, his intent is to make this world better place, one topic at a time. Not bad for a poor Irish kid from Michigan.",1067904000,3,1371,4.4229249011857705

Michael Moore is a film-making genius! His guerilla style is perfectly suited for the subject matter. Who else has even attempted to ask the question ""Why so much fear and violence in america?"" without finding simplistic, kneejerk answers? Moore takes us to Columbine to not only relive the tragedy, but to talk with the surviving victims. He even takes them to K Mart's HQ to confront the company's policy of selling handgun ammo (the columbine shooters purchased their bullets at the local k mart) with successful results. This is not just some propoganda film about the evils of gun ownership. Moore himself was raised with guns and still carries his NRA membership card. This movie is about Moore's quest to find out why we love to kill each other so much here in the states. Is it poverty? Nope, other countries have worse economic problems without the bloodletting. Is it violent music or video games? Uh-uh, these are endemic throughout the civilized world. Could it be the proliferation of handguns? No, Canada has millions of guns and it's big cities have the murder rates of our small towns! Is it our violent, gun-toting history? Negative, the entire planet has a bloody, violent past. Moore has the audacity to try to get to the bottom of this mess. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is not for the squeamish or the political zealot from either right or left. It's for folks who wonder at what we've become. It's for people like me who hate the idea of barracading themselves in their homes for fear of being slaughtered. This fear is also challenged here. Many sacred cow arguments are terminated. Prepare to be angered, saddened, provoked, offended, and oddly entertained as only Michael Moore can do.

1837958,1,B00008DDVU,"I refused to subscribe to the hype surrounding this feature until I saw it and analyzed it for myself. (For the record, I'm politically independent). After viewing it, I have to say I am now one of its detractors.
What could have been an interesting look at America's gun culture and the sources of the Columbine massacre is instead an overhyped and poorly structured mess. Nearly every argument Moore expounds is flawed by his patronizing and sanctimonious attitude towards the truth. During the course of this documentary he:
1) Misquotes stats to fit his agenda. He does this so much that I'm not going to waste time documenting every example. He notes that Canada has double our unemployment rate but many fewer homicides, failing to note that Canada's population is smaller than ours; in other words, he doesn't consider crimes by percentage of population; rather, he just looks at percentages overall. He also states that Canadians have seven million guns in ten million homes, but they have fewer homicides. Well, Canada has much stricter handgun licensing and registration laws than the US; i.e.; they have better gun control; yet Moore undermines his own point by stating that our looser gun control laws aren't the reason for gun violence; it's our culture. So, why try to make a serious, defining point about Canada's rate of gun ownership if you're going to make it irrelevant with your own words? He also ignores the decline in youth violence and school shootings. He holds up two incidents--Columbine, and a shooting in Flint, Michigan--as examples of an ""epidemic.""
Moore also claims that overseas military action by the US goverment is part of the reason for our ""culture of violence,"" citing the bombing of Afghanistan as evidence of our aggression. He notes that the United Kingdom has a substantially smaller number of homicides than the US. He fails to acknowledge, however, the UK's role in the bombing of Yugoslavia and its role in the military action in Iraq. If the two are interrelated, then why the discrepancy? He also tries to accuse the US of funding the same Taliban regime responsible for harboring Bin Laden and Al Qaeda when he ominously notes that the US gave $245 million to Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001. Wrong again, Michael. That money was given to the UN and independent organizations for famine relief.
2) He alters the notorious 1988 Bush/Quayle ""Willie Horton"" ad by adding some superimposed text: ""Willie Horton released. Then he kills again."" This was NEVER in the original ad (available online, if you want proof) but Moore somehow forgets to note this alteration and just lets his audience assume that it's the truth. (For the record, after being released, Horton did not kill; he committed rape).
3) Moore is generally guilty of every sin he accuses the media of committing. He argues time and again that the media is reponsible for America's culture of fear and violence. He implies that they sensationalize violence and portray certain people--namely blacks--in stereotypical ways. That's funny, because Moore spends a fair portion of time both sensationalizing violence and portraying mean-spirited stereotypes--not of blacks, but of average-Joe, working-class gun owners. They come across as ignorant, uneducated rednecks, with Moore pausing occasionally for a bit of juvenile humor at their expense. This is especially egregious, since Moore has long championed himself as an advocate of the working class; yet he spends a great deal of time mocking them.
--He also resorts to the worst tactics of tabloid journalism, getting people to cry on camera (while he provides comfort) or attempting to interview people only vaguely attached to the Columbine massacre (such as Dick Clark). He brings two wounded Columbine students to KMart's headquarters, guilting them into dropping their sale of ammunition. (Funny, though; he doesn't speak of going after the companies that made the chemicals in Klebold and Harris' homemade bombs). The nadir, however, is his ambush interview of NRA president Charlton Heston, who seems both confused and outraged. Even if Heston had had all of his faculties, Moore would have made a mess of this interview. His line of questioning was incoherent, unconnected and irrelevant. It is obvious that he only sought to embarrass Heston (Moore's dislike of him is well-known) rather than gain any insight for his viewers. It is an unconfortable and tasteless segment.
What a mess. Moore, who showed some talent as a filmmaker with the wry (but statistically flawed) ""Roger and Me,"" has used his abilities to produce a shoddy, irresponsible documentary that is a serious affront to the truth. Moore would have better served us by addressing some of the unanswered questions about Columbine--the possibility of a 3rd gunman, was there advanced warning, etc.--than by wasting our time with this travesty.

1837959,1,B00008DDVU,"Since I turned off television, 2 years ago and my brain began to regenerate, I began to morph from a consumer into a researcher--you know the most feared by the corporatites.  As I read magazines, op ed pieces, books, and internet sites, I began to discover a whole new world, specifically the New World Order.  What is it?  Well, it is plans to put us into a world government top-down structure, not bottom-up structure as we were led to believe we were already living in.  You think the United States, you think Democracy.  Wrong, no Democracy, and soon to be no United States.  If you don't believe me, turn off your ""reality"" TV shows and start reading or at least listening if you don't read and very few of us can and do any more.
So what's this got to do with Michael Moore's highly acclaimed ""Bowling for Columbine.""  AK-47s.  Indeed with great horror the leftist gun control hawks (undercover for the New World Order guys) says ""All those instruments of mass distraction do, is kill humans and are not necessary to kill those sweet little animals we all know and love to eat.""  So what, so if you have a dictatorship with highly protected body armor, you want a 22 rifle or you want an AK 47?
It is ridiculous to take a few incidents like Columbine as proof of the need for ""gun control."" Indeed, the more out-field types of researchers believe incidents such as Columbine and 911 were planned and financed by the New World Order elites (hidden ever to carefully like the Wizard of Oz) to provoke rabble roosters to demand a gun-free (especially AK-47) United States.  Though, I must admit, Michael did show in the film that the real cause for the violence in the United States is the pitiful horror shows pawned off as television news.  To try to condition us to believe, that we are too dumb to have guns in our households where ""children"" might get hold of them is the highest form of idiocy unless our children have all turned into idiots.  Growing up in the Texas, our father was known (from the day I first understood language) to always keep a fully loaded gun behind most doors. He had a shot gun and several 22s.  We had chickens and we ate chickens and so did our friendly neighbors, the raccoons, the possums, and the ring-tail cats.  Those neighbors made nightly forays into the chicken house and my father made nightly forays on the neighbors.  Awful society, don't you agree?  Should have had gun control.  In Jim Hightower's book, ""Theves in High Places"" you will well see that our neighbors in ""federal government"" have been raiding our chicken house and rather badly, so I don't expect we will have many chickens in our pots.  So, if a ""liberal"" writer says all those guns are bad, I will automatically know that he is undercover ""raccoon, possum or ring-tail cat.""  With the new American Union already underway with the eventual elimination of our Bill of Rights and Constitution,  the protection of the ""right to bear arms, even AK-47s and tanks should be the very first thing we do each and every day from here on until the police and army of any nation switch from gun and bomb fondling to actual peacekeepers who work on managing earth to grow food and forest for everyone, even Iraqis and maybe a little for raccoons too. The other part of our day should be spent in working to vote everyone, I mean, everyone presently in office out of office peacefully, (after we  wrest the voting machines out of Diebold and their cohorts sticky fixed-election corporate voting hands) except maybe Dennis Kucinich (though misguided as to the gun issue).  We should retain those who voted against the war against Iraq or the $87 billion grant to Halliburton to ""rejoin what man (particularly Halliburton man, Dick Cheney)  had set asunder.""  We the People need a defense against a tyranical government.  Didn't our founding fathers know that and why don't we know it today and why do we have to repeat history?  George the England king or George the United States  king, ironic, right, just like 911.  Our first way to vote, of course, is to get the attention of executives of the global corporations with our spending habits.  Buy at least mininum-wage produced products, write corps, tell them you don't buy ""Made in China"" at 20 cents a day or why is the item not priced at 25 cents, tell Wal-Mart to put its bullets back in after you don't buy there, because it is stocked with Made in China, tell Dell and Hewlett Packard you will not use their off-shore tech support, etc., etc.  Do you think this review will be here tomorrow?
So if you have a little money to spend for ""education and/or entertainment,"" after Jim Hightower's book, start with Meria Heller at Meria.net where she has a book list. You might want to listen to her daily radio show.  The only reason the Franken book is number 1 is because it wants to caution us to get rid of our guns.  After Bowling for Columbine, I wanted to take a second look at Carlton Heston.  Maybe I will spend this evening looking for his speeches and reading some more of the book ""Bush's Brains.""",1067558400,12,5063,4.59

1837962,2,B00008DDVU,"Okay, Moore is indeed a clever and sometimes humorus guy.  And, he really covers a heck of alot of ground in this film. Where do I begin!  I mean, according to Moore, the NRA is just an offshoot of the KKK, the media has been busy frightening the average American with stories about invading killer bees, a corporate white collar crime reality show would be really alot more interesting than ""COPS"", America's past is tainted with more blood than Stalin's Russsia, we can't forget ENRON,white folks are armed to the teeth because they are scared of the black community, America is in grave economic decline, air pollution is killing us and we can't even arrest anybody for it, and Canada is really a much better place to live than America!  Phew!  That's quite a few topics to try to cover in just  over two hours.
Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I am a proud member of the NRA.  When I decided to view this film, I was expecting a tirade against the right to bear arms.  Sure, Moore delivers plenty of that, but I was suprised by what else I saw - and how Moore continued to contradict himself.  Throughout the film, Moore admits that as handgun ownership increased in communities, crime rates actually went down.  He also notes that in Canada, despite high rates of firearm ownership, there is a much lower homocide rate than in the US.  So it isn't the guns.  Yet, despite these admissions, Moore continues to go back and indirectly blame the ""gun nuts"" at the NRA.
Or does he?  Just when I was sure that Moore was blaming guns for EVERYTHING, he does go on to make a few points that I do agree with.  First of all, I agree with Moore in his contention that the mass media continually pumps the American public full of fear.  A quick look at the nightly news confirms this to be true.  So, for a time I'm finding some agreement with Moore.
But then he just goes off on another tangent about welfare, the greedy ""rich"", the defense industry, Bush, and of course the NRA.
If it sounds like this review isn't ordered and coherent, it's not.  And that's because the film wasn't either.  Moore just bounces around from topic to topic with no real direction - and, perhaps more importanly, without any meaningful conclusion.  I don't agree with Moore on most of his issues, and quite frankly, I think he's a rather dishonest guy.  But I do think there is SOME glimmer of insight here . . but Moore blows it.",1067385600,11,2432,4.473922902494331
1837963,5,B00008DDVU,"Over six hundred reviews strong and nothing gained, just opinions upon opinions.  Sure Michael Moore has distorted the truth in some ways to get his point across, but can you think of anyone who doesn't use rhetoric and propagandist tactics on a daily basis to gain support for their own particular cause?  I loved this movie, regardless of whether or not he distorted some of his facts.  The reason for this is Michael Moore is trying to communicate to us, everyone, liberal or conservative, that there is something inherently wrong with the society we live in.  To denounce him with comments like ""Michael Moore is a big fat idiot"" only strengthens a persons ignorance and narrow-mindedness.  This is not about Conservative or Liberal bashing.  It is a statement concerning the social dilemnas we all watch on our biased television screen, then forget about once the evening news is over.  WAKE UP!!!!!  What do think this government is doing as we speak?  You speak about a distortion of the facts?  PLEASE!!!!  It's time to get rid of this whole liberal-conservative system and start focusing on solutions, not the juvenile slander of people like David S. Rhodes, whose other review praising a conservative book states ""overall, liberals are going to hate Laura (the author) like they hate most things that are good and decent and true.""  GIVE ME A BREAK!  If that is not the most generalizing, ignorant, statement I've heard in some time!

1837985,3,B00008DDVU,"This film was a fantastic expose on the sort of domestic problems within the United States placed on a level that the average person can understand. Michael Moore, surprisingly, does not merely address gun control. For example, he touches on the endemic problem in America concerning the African American underclass and what is and is not being done to remedy the situation.
However, he spoils his work by inappropriately, (sometimes inaccurately ie/Bosnia) discussing international affairs. Moore seems to believe that bad moves by the U.S. government corrolate with the domestic issue of gun control. He wags his finger at overseas military action, that is not always unwarranted, as if it is the reason that the Columbine shootings occured. Simply because the U.S. military has guns and has the tendency to act aggressively overseas does not mean that is why an American civilian will buy a gun and start schooling (Lee Harvey Oswald being an obvious exception). The Canadian military has firearms too and has been involved in nearly every conflict the United States has been involved in for the last century excluding the Vietnam war and the recent war on Iraq. This was a poor attempt by Moore to put his views on American foreign policy in this film that should have rightly stayed on U.S. soil.
""Bowling for Columbine"" gets minus one star for the shameless plug of international views and minus one point for inaccuracies and misleading statements on that point.",1067126400,6,1469,5.049382716049383
1837986,2,B00008DDVU,"I didn't fully understand this film, perhaps you really have to be American to get it.  Michael Moore's point seems to be that Americans are more violent than other people, I have no idea whether this is ture or not.  Does he want to ban guns? I couldn't quite  make out exactly what he wanted.  He is very fond of following people around with a camera and trying to interview them, but i understand he doesn't much care for it when others do the same to him.  I heard he got someone thrown in jail for pestering him in a similar manner?  Is this true?  I would love to know.  He succeeded in irritating Charlton Heston, i rather hoped Mr. Heston might take a swing at him, but instead he just walked away, somewhat to my dissapointment.  He seems to approve of Canada, where apparently it's so safe people don't even lock their doors.  this, if true, is very dissapointing.  I had the impression that Canada was a sinister, dangerous country full of vampires, werewolves, deomns, ghosts, ghouls, and entrances to Hell.  This is because I spend too much time reading the novels of Tanya Huff, who has succeeded in making Canada a very exciting place, to me anyway.  Michael moore has really dissillusioned me.  Would gun control make America less violent?  I live in a country where it is practically impossible to own a gun, most people never even see a real gun, yet that doesn't stop nutters from getting hold of them every so often and going on the rampage.

He is intelligent, when he interviews people, like Charles Heston, people who hold different views against him, he does it respectfully, more respectfully than the way some of the people criticizing his film talk about him. He uses straight facts and kind of puts it all out on a plate for you. He says stuff like, ""Australia has 34 gun related deaths a year...the US has 11,600 some.."" He doesn't tell you everything you are supposed to believe, he sets facts, interviews, and what not clearly out on a plate and he lets you make your own opinion.
 Having lived in 7 other countries during my life time, in Africa, Asia and Europe,and now CALI. I probably have a different view of the US. My parents are US diplomats, I am not ignorant, I know a lot about the US. I love being American, but sometimes watching the news, as big hearted as the american ppl are, it's almost like what the hell..why would i want to live here? the poor people get stepped on, though the majority of the american people are generous and loving, and would love to see equality amongst all the classes, we are being overuled by a minority (white men) who are in charge.
 i saw moore speak last night on campus and it was interesting. he said that he had done lots of polls, in usa today, the new yorker..various magazines and stats pointed out that most of the public is liberal. even when he asked one guy in the audience who had said he was republican some questions, he said.
""So you're a repubican..do you think that men and women should get equal pay?""
Yes the guy said.
""Do you think that gays and lesbians should be discriminated against?""
No the guy said.
He basically went on and was like..see most ppl are republican because they don't want their money to be taken out of their pockets..but they have liberal views.

1837990,5,B00008DDVU,"This is a powerful documentary which looks into the unsusually large number of gun deaths in the United States.  It had me in tears.  To see the extent to which fear grips the minds of Americans--fear of terrorists, fear of minorities, fear of the government, fear of being unpopular--the list goes on and on.  Moore makes the point that this fear is what drives the violence in America.  We're constantly bombarded with messages of fear from the media and the government.  For a comparison, look at Canada.  There are a large number of guns in Canada, but the gun violence rate is nowhere near the gun violence rate of America.  Why is this?
Some may say that there is a lot of gun violence in America because we have a violent history.  Well, that theory doesn't hold any water.  Germany and Japan have had a very violent history (think of the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking), but the rate of gun violence in those countries is low compared with America's rate.  Also you can't say it's violent movies or games.  They watch and play those in other countries too.
It's about time someone took on the NRA.  Perhaps the saddest scene is the last one in which Charlton Heston struggles to defend his views on gun ownership.  He just sticks his foot in his mouth and had to run away.  I really applaud Moore for his ability to chase down and confront these gun nuts.

Many people might not like Moore for his beliefs or the way he goes about getting his ideas to the public, me included, but there is something very thought provoking here.  Moore asks repeatedly,""Why are more Americans killing each other?""  He interviews countless numbers of people showing both sides of the spectrum; those for guns and those against.  This documentary does deal with a very serious subject, but Moore is able to inject humor into with his dry wit using certain camera angles and impeccable timing.  One of the most effective parts of the movie is Moore's interview with Charlton Heston, who gets caught up in his own web of excuses.  It is startling to see that Heston has no response, or not a good one, for most of Moore's questions.
  The Bowling for Columbine DVD is very good.  It includes numerous extras some of which are very good.  There are several interviews with Moore on different talk shows as well as an interview about Moore's controversial acceptance speech at the Oscars.

Being 18, and raised in a very liberal environment in the Boston suburbs, I was agreeing with them for the longest time, but then I watched it a second time with new information and realized that while making its point (to me anyway, WAY too many people writing here certainly missed it...), there was something bothering me.
You have to admit that Moore is good at what he does. He always does an excellent job of setting up his scenes and shots. Whether you agree with his opinions or not, his view, as portrayed by the camera, does a great job of seizing you. He does prey on the unwittingness of others, and i'm sure that Moore would not want to be the victim of his own tactics. But sound splicing and video editing? Moore what is this? Its false advertising, that's what it is. This movie is a semi-documentary, if that...that's what bothers me about this movie.
The cartoon (with NRA and KKK, and such) I thought was a over the top. While being very funny (clearly the brain child of the creators of South Park), many of the facts are distorted. Yet other scenes such as with Nichols, who, I'm sorry to say, is still not familiar with Ghandi, and with the kids ditching school in Canada were, I thought, the most imortant. People who have been writing reviews of this have either been apparantly so enlightened by this movie that ""OMG!!! 5 stars...this is genious! Guns are terrible!"" or ranted that ""Moore sucks, GUNS UP!"" Well, this movie is NOT about guns. It's about Americans as human beings, and why we don't (as a whole) have as much regard for life as say, Canadians or the French. That's what this film is attacking. I guess you could say that its attacking our culture, but that didn't bother me. People are either so far to the left or so far to the right that they can't see this movie for what it is.
This *MOVIE* is worth seeing.

1838008,4,B00008DDVU,"****1/2 ""If more guns made people safer, then America would be one of the safest countries in the world.""
This statement, uttered midway through the film by a Canadian citizen, serves pretty much as the guiding thesis for ""Bowling For Columbine,"" the amazing, eye-opening ""dissertation"" by Michael Moore, which won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature of 2002.  Moore, the well-known left-wing tub-thumper and self-appointed thorn-in-the-side of the American conservative establishment, is clearly a man on a mission.  He wants to figure out why exactly it is that Americans seem to have a running love affair with violence and guns.  Moore takes on Charlton Heston, the NRA (of which Moore claims to be a member), the news media, and the overall culture of paranoia and fear that seems to hold Americans in its grasp.  The director views the Columbine High School shootings in 1999 as the symptom rather than the cause of the problem, the inevitable tragic outcome of a munitions-obsessed culture.
Anybody turning to this film for a ""fair"" and ""unbiased"" study of the problem certainly does not know much about Michael Moore and the kind of movies he makes.  Moore is upfront and utterly unapologetic about his own left-leaning sympathies and the film will assuredly outrage many on the opposing side of the issue.  Yet one thing that even Moore's greatest detractors will have to admit is that he is definitely a man of passion, an individual who sees a problem in the world and who pools his resources and skills as a documentarian to help awaken public consciousness and, thereby, prompt reasonable-thinking people to come up with a solution.
Perhaps, the most astonishing thing about ""Bowling For Columbine"" is just how funny so much of it turns out to be.  Though basically a jeremiad, Moore's film still manages to find humor in the mind-bending absurdity and jaw-dropping irony of so much of what we see on screen.  Moore is an amazing satirist, yet in many cases all he has to do is to let the people and situations speak for themselves in order to achieve his laughs.  For instance, he starts off his film answering an ad from a bank (of all places!) that offers its customers a gun for opening up a new account.  No fictional satirist could come up with better material than that.  Why press your issues when your subjects are doing such a fine job of it for you?  From that point on, Moore is off and running, taking swipes at not just the NRA but at the defense industry, the Clinton and Bush administrations, welfare reform, and shows like ""COPS,"" which Moore sees as exploiting and enhancing Americans' irrational fear of crime and people of color.  In some ways, these are the weakest sections of the film, perhaps because Moore seems to be casting his net a bit too widely, muddling his message and making assumptions that sometimes seem unwarranted and overly simplistic.  One appreciates his attempt to come up with some possible wider answers, but, frankly, he is at his most compelling when - for lack of a better phrase - he keeps the gun industry and those who support it clearly in his sights.
Still, Moore makes a compelling case for much of what he is implying in this film - that the culture of violence is all-encompassing in this nation and that incidents like Columbine are just small pieces in an overall much larger picture.  Sure there are those who will accuse Moore of being ""un-American,"" of always trying to cast the United States in the worst possible light, of even, perhaps, giving ""aid and comfort"" to the nation's enemies.  Yet, isn't this what a healthy free society needs - someone who is willing to point out a nation's shortcomings in the hope of making it a better place in which to live?  It seems to me we need more Moore's - on both the left and the right - to help keep the powers-that-be honest and connected to the concerns of ordinary people.
Alternately hilarious and horrifying, harrowing and heartbreaking, ""Bowling For Columbine"" will make you cry one moment and laugh the next.  Moore is a man in total control of his medium, his message, even, perhaps, his audience.  That might be a scary, dangerous thought if you happen to find yourself on the opposite side of the issue from Moore.  After all, one man's ""truth"" can be another man's ""propaganda.""  All I can suggest is that, regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall on, give the man a fair hearing.  The right should be so lucky as to have a filmmaker of Mr. Moore's caliber and skill on its team.  Perhaps some day it will.",1065916800,4,4559,4.735777496839444
1838009,1,B00008DDVU,"I couldn't care less that Mr. Moore is anti-gun.  My advice to him would be to protest by not buying or possessing a firearm. What does bother me is his distorting, telling half-truths, his manipulating audio and video to make things appear truthful, and other times just flat-out lying to make others believe what he's presenting as fact.
In the ""film"", Moore attempts to portray the NRA (yes, I'm a proud, dues paying member) as cold and heartless for coming to Denver after the Columbine shootings for, as he puts it, a ""large pro-gun rally"". This is misleading. In fact, all rallies, dinners, sporting events, etc. were canceled out of respect for victims' families. The only thing that took place was an annual members' meeting which was required to be held under corporate law.  At the same meeting, Moore takes the snipets of a Charlton Heston speech and puts them in the order that he wants. Heston is reading a letter from the mayor of Denver asking that the meeting be cancelled. Heston is shown to reply, ""Don't come here?  We're already here."" Again, this is meant to make the NRA look defiant, cold, and heartless. However, Moore leaves out the part where Heston is saying that there are already scores of NRA members living in the Denver area. ""We're already here"", refers to them.  But playing the speech the way it was originally delivered doesn't make Heston look like a cold-blooded monster, so Moore had to make changes.
The next lie centers on the young girl that was shot near Flint, MI. Again, Moore states ""Just as he did after the Columbine shooting, Charlton Heston showed up in Flint, to have a big pro-gun rally."" Never one to leave out unimportant facts, Moore fails to mention Heston was in Flint eight months after the shooting for a ""get out the vote"" rally. Vice-President Gore was also in the area at that time for the same purpose but Moore apparently found that acceptable.
The cartoon comparing NRA members to KKK members is also pure nonsense. The NRA was founded in 1871 (five years after the KKK)by Union officers who were supportive of the rights of black citizens. In fact, eight of the first ten NRA presidents were former Union veterans including President U.S. Grant.  Teddy Roosevelt was also a life member.
Finally, the interview with Heston in his home by Moore was particularly underhanded, in my opinion. Moore presents himself as an NRA life member, which helps him gain entrance into Heston's home. Perhaps Heston made a disagreeable comment or two, but Moore still takes advantage of a man in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Moore takes advantage of the fact that Heston has a foggy memory of the events by continuing to act as if Heston came to Flint soon after the six-year-old girl was shot. Just like his final act of placing the picture of the girl at Heston's door, the entire visit was a play for the cameras. Moore apparently has no shame.
No one was a bigger fan of Roger and Me when it was released and I enjoyed ""TV Nation"" when it played on NBC in the mid-90's. Moore showed that he genuinely knew about the topics in Roger and Me which concerned the loss of good manufacturing jobs and corporate greed. He should return to that theme if he has to lie to play the role of gun grabber.  Like I said before, Moore is entitled to his opinion about firearms or anything else. It doesn't bother me that he doesn't like guns. His attempts to influence others through lies and deception does.",1065830400,25,3458,4.660655737704918

To call ""Bowling For Columbine"" a documentary is laughable.  In a genuine documentary, one of two approaches is taken.  The author will either start with a hypothesis and attempt to prove/disprove it through investigative journalism, or he'll investigate a topic in an attempt to provide some insight.  Moore does neither.
Instead, Michael Moore pollutes the screen with his unpleasant form, bouncing from scene to scene making no points in particular.  Hijacking an inevitably controversial topic, gun control, Moore gives his audience a paltry excuse at objectivity by interviewing people on both sides of the issue.
Moore follows no path of reason, nor does he make a persuasive case for his  obvious anti-gun bias.  Just as the audience might start to doze off, Moore becomes inflammatory, badgering K-Mart into policy change and staging an infantile display of emotional drivel and character assassination directed at an overly polite Charlton Heston.
""Bowling For Columbine"" at long last grinds to an abrupt much-awaited conclusion, cheating this viewer out of an opportunity to demand a refund before the end of show.",1065744000,9,1388,5.488262910798122
1838022,5,B00008DDVU,"Having been a freshman in High School in Denver when the shootings at Columbine occurred, I'd like to thank Michael Moore for making me remember and cry.  There has been a lot of criticism of Moore for playing fast and loose with the facts, but as a student in Colorado at the time, I personally remember the events of Columbine in a deeply personal way.  I am not anti-gun, I've been shooting since I was nine, and my dad was a member of the NRA before Charlton Heston's insensitve and morally corrupt decision to come to Denver and have his effing rally.  Whatever criticism you may have of Moore, his facts regarding the Columbine Shooting are dead on.  I had friends at Columbine.  And while I fully believe we have the right to carry a gun, I also believe we have a moral obligation as human beings to let a community grieve without attempting to use people's sorrow to further our own ends, which is exactly what Charlton Heston did.  I don't care how you vote, but this is a damn good movie about an extremely tragic occurrence, and if Moore did a damn good job.",1065657600,5,1069,4.428571428571429

I don't know how much of it to believe or ignore because I know for sure Moore has no idea about the middle east and believes all the rulers there are dictators by stating ""dictator of Kuwait.""

Also,I thought it would have been interesting for Moore to have  gone to inner city areas that are known for gang violence with guns like Los Angeles,Chicago or Detroit and talk to gang members there about why they keep getting guns to do their violence? He could have interviewed some Crips and Bloods while he was in South Central L.A.",1065657600,5,698,4.721311475409836

I really got the impression that 'Roger' was a much more personal movie for Moore, whereas I saw a lot more ego showing through in BFC.
Let me lay down a few things first:
1.  I TOTALLY believe that a LOT of facts about the NRA's actions, post-Columbine, were intentionally distorted.
2.  I KNOW a lot of facts about Lockheed-Martin were flat-out wrong.
That said, it's skewed presentation of the facts almost completely kills the works credibility, and that's terrible because it raises a LOT of really interesting points about our society when compared to other countries and their problems (or lack there of) with violent crime.

1838026,5,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore has made a very moving, very well made documentary with ""Bowling for Columbine.""  The story takes interesting twists and turns, and only after an hour or so will you see where Moore is headed.  He makes surprisingly effective and powerful statements about why such tragedies happen in the United States.  It will be a shame if people do not watch this movie simply because they disagree with Moore's obvious and blatant leftist politics; the emphasis on violence in the US is so much more important than political persuasion. Viewers should note that Moore is no kinder to Bill Clinton than he is to GW Bush.  Another big surprise in the movie is a brilliant interview Moore has with Marilyn Manson.  Look in particular for Manson's answer to what he would want say to Columbine students.
For those that wonder about Moore, and whether his ""common man"" approach is for real or not, some of the extra features on the DVD should resolve their doubts.  His recounting of his ""Oscar experience,"" and another extra showing portions of his first return to Denver following Columbine, are excellent.

As for those who come out of the woodworks to challenge his facts, check out his website, where he cites sources for all the data presented about gun deaths and other info.

1838042,5,B00008DDVU,"This is the best treatment of the gun control issue which you could ever hope to see.  Although Michael Moore is rightly considered a far-left liberal, he is by no means anti-gun (he grew up in Flint, Michigan and is himself a lifetime member of the NRA), and his movie does not so much blame guns as view them as one small piece of a larger problem.  Other aspects of this issue that are highlighted in the film include the climate of fear created and aggravated by the US media; the failure of the US to provide adequate social services to the poor (we see a single mother who is forced to commute several hours a day in a impossible struggle to make ends meet); the ridiculously easy access to ammunition for handguns (Moore portrays the successful efforts of several Columbine survivors who petition K-Mart to ban the sale of these bullets); and, of course, the pathetic and self-serving rhetoric of the NRA (illustrated through an unbelievable and often hilarious interview with NRA president Charleton Heston).
Moore's in-your-face film-making technique is brilliant; his disarming, Lt. Columbo-like manner results in startling statements by his subjects--for example, the brother of Terry Nichols, convicted Oklahoma City conspirator, saying that access to weapons-grade Plutonium should be restricted because ""there are crazy people out there""; Charleton Heston insisting on his right to bear arms but admitting that he does not need the many loaded guns in his home for protection, etc.  Moore asks all the right questions in a variety of situations, from trying to get Dick Clark on the record to quizzing Canadians about their low homicide numbers to interviewing Marilyn Manson (who offers a surprisingly serious, thoughtful, and intelligent perspective).
Moore also does an incredible job of balancing humor--ie, an animated look at the history of America from the creators of South Park--with horror--namely, the raw video footage from the Columbine masscre. This remarkable documentary was awarded a well-deserved Oscar; it is absolutely a must-see regardless of your political views.",1065398400,3,2099,5.222551928783383
1838043,5,B00008DDVU,"After attempting to read 'Stupid White Men' in its entirety, I was skeptical about watching 'Bowling for Columbine' to say the least. The former had made me think that Moore really didn't have much of a point, but the film, having just watched it, helped me gain respect for what he had to say. Plus, now that I see how extreme the reviews about the movie are (most of them being either 1 or 5 stars), I feel my gut confirmed that there's something important that he's trying to say, and I for one, want to listen to it.
This documentary is long (some 2 hours) but it needs to be so: the issue presented has multiple dimensions and Moore is very effective in their presentation. Bringing back terrible memories from Columbine HS shooting and the killing of a 6-year old by a classmate in Flint, MI, Moore ponders once and again why (all other things being equal) would the US have such a high gunshot death rate, compared to all other first world nations. My first thought, when I saw the figures that he presented (US having 11,127 gunshot deaths in a year, compared to Japan's 39 or Canada's 165), was that he was not being fair, since he was leaving out the country's population. Well, taking the time to compute how many persons per million get shot to death in all the countries he compared the US against (consulting population figures in the CIA factbook online), it turns out that this number is 7.48 times higher in the US than its nearest 'gunshot death rate' neighbor (Canada) and a striking 127 times higher than Japan's 0.30 persons per million killed by a gun in a year's time. So his point is still clearly valid!
""All other things being equal"", as I said before, is very broad, yet he tackled on most issues I can think of, when comparing the US with other countries in terms of possible causes for how violent we are: history of violence (think Germany and WWII, Britain and massacres in India), amount of guns owned (in Canada, almost 70% of the families own guns), violent movies or violent games (global broadcasting, display and sales of these make them available equally to audiences everywhere -indeed, the point can be made that a large number of violent video games come from Japan, where the issue is nowhere as critical), etc.
(spoilers ahead, if you don't mind them)
Granted that something is wrong when a 6-year old shoot another one in school, after discarding alternate hypothesis and interviewing people ranging from pro-gun control activists to NRA's very own Charlton Heston (no comment on him...) Moore comes to the conclusion (one that I particularly agree with) that we, as a society, are being bred in a culture of fear: the media feed us with the most absurd stories day in, day out, which put the fear in us, though some law enforcement officers argue that crime numbers have actually gone down, which results in an escalade of gun and bullet purchasing. This unfortunately is not helped by the 2+ year-long stand of the US in its battle against terrorism, with frequent terror alerts and attacks on Afghanistan and Irak taking place, since more and more people end up fearing that the terrible tragedy of September 11 could strike them close to home soon.

1838046,5,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore has created a documentary that will truly make you question everything you thought you knew.  And that's the ultimate goal of a documentary, isn't it?  In ""Bowling for Columbine"", Moore examines the fascination with guns and violence in America.  In doing so, he compares the U.S. with Canada, England, German, and other countries with a large amount of guns, but not the same amount of violence.  He poses the question, why the U.S?  Why do we have the violence with guns that other countries don't?  He doesn't necessarily give us the answer, but he does give us a lot of food for thought, allowing us to make our own decisions.
I'm aware that this movie has offended a lot of people, specifically with how the U.S. is portrayed.  Let's face it, though, everything he mentioned was the truth, and we all know the truth hurts.  This movie definitely deserved the awards and positive praise it's received, and the DVD is an excellent supplement to the movie.  Several documentaries, a music video, and a commentary are all included.  The commentary, by the interns that worked on the movie, is very entertaining and does offer a lot of insight into how the film was made.

1838047,4,B00008DDVU,"Like many other people in the US, I first heard about this movie via the news (TV and Radio).  So much was said; both negative and positive, that it raised my curiosity about the movie. The furor made me pay to go see for myself what all the controversy was about.  After watching the movie, I do not understand why some people seem to think that this movie is anti-gun.  Mr. Moore raised several good points in the movie that tells me that violence in our culture has no simple answer.
I believe some math can help with all the confusion.  In the movie, Mr. Moore states some figures that I will use:
Total Population in Canada - 30,000,000
Total Population in America - 260,000,000
Total Murder in Canada - 554
Total Murder in America - 15,000
Divide Total Murder by Total Population.
Multiply your answer by 100,000 and you will get the following statistics
Canadian Murder Rate - 1.8 Murders for every 100,000 people.
American Murder Rate - 5.8 Murders for every 100,000 people.
As you can see, there are more people in America, hence the chances for violence is greater.  I do not mean to imply that violence is not a major issue in this country, because it is, but let us address the issue with clear, rational minds.  Is an increase in population an answer for all the ills in our society?  No.  But the above example illustrates how important it is to take things with a grain of salt.  The news agencies are always bombarding the public with statistics and numbers that may seem scary, until you take the time to figure out what they really mean.
Mr. Moore did a great job of bringing to our attention a difficult issue, violence in our culture.  But the answers to stopping the violence are not simple.  It isn't violent television or video games; go to Japan where all the children have access to even more violent games and television, the crime rate there is lower.  It can't just be gun ownership, because Canada has a large portion of their population who own guns, yet less violence occurs in Canada.  It can't just be our history, because there are other countries with even more violence in their histories than our own and yes, their crime rate is lower.  For myself, I believe it is a whole host of factors that contribute to the violence in our country.  The only way to figure out how to stop it is if we devote time and energy to study the problem and come-up with a solution.  I can't promise a Utopia or even to stop all the violence, but we can at least minimize it.",1065225600,2,2492,4.455947136563877

Here's another proof (if you needed one) that some people (including clever, educated and sophisticated people) will swallow anything and give it a big thumbs-up, as long as it has bad things to say about Dubya and as long as it repeats tired mantras about evil American imperialism and capitalists stealing from the working people.
Add a generous helping of shallow rambling about race (apparently, America became rich through slavery), general failure to understand cause and effect in any social phenomenon, and the usual self-centered and self-important stage presence of the author, so often seen in poorly made documentaries, and you have a general description of this unberably boring, predictable and lame documentary.",1065225600,11,1028,5.274390243902439
1838049,5,B00008DDVU,"I've seen all of Michael Moore's films, and enjoyed them all, and I believe this is the best film he's made.  In the past I've sometimes been uncomfortable when Moore puts underlings on the spot, harassing them for the actions of corporate heads, but happily that never happens here.  Instead, each scene is thoughtful and insightful, raising provocative questions that any thoughtful person -- conservative or liberal -- should ask themselves about violence in this country.  I've long been interested in this issue and have read a lot, but I still found surprising information here.  It's easy to think that we are more violent (with over eleven thousand gun deaths a year) because we watch violent movies and play violent video games -- but so do the Japanese; it's easy to think we may be more violent because we have a violent past -- but so do Germans; it's easy to think we might be more violent because we have so many guns in this country -- but so do Canadians.

Moore travels to Littleton Colorado, Flint Michigan, California and Canada, and he speaks to law enforcement officials, teachers, Marilyn Manson, Charleton Heston and Columbine students as he tries to piece together what makes America so uniquely violent.  Moore and his team come up with some answers, but even more questions, in this important film.

DVD extras are plentiful and include: a trailer; a short introduction by Moore; a 15-minute monologue about his Academy Award acceptance speech (though the Academy wouldn't let Moore use footage of the event); film commentary by secretaries, interns and production assistants; a talk Moore gave to a Littleton, Colorado, crowd in February 2003; a 16-minute featurette about the film's reception at Cannes, the Oscars and the Toronto Film Festival; and Marilyn Manson's ""Fight Song"" music video.

The issue of violence in America should supersede politics, and Moore does not mention politics in the film.  When so many of us have been touched by violence, it is in ALL our interests to try to make sense of it and improve the situation.  Do conservatives OR liberals want to live in a world where we are afraid, where we are victimized, where we are torn from friends and relatives by violence?  This is an important issue and Moore has made an important film.  Great viewing with a group -- lively discussion afterward!",1065139200,2,2346,4.9113924050632916
1838050,5,B00008DDVU,"What's interesting about Bolwing For Columbine is that Michael Moore doesn't really come to many conclusions. Instead, he opens up a discussion about the alarming fact that America has a lot more gun violence than almost any country on earth.
Using the Columbine school shooting as the basis of his inquiry, Moore looks at the wider question and talks to a lot of people, from victims of the shooting to Marilyn Manson to Chuck Heston. A lot of possibilities are thrown around but this film is more about the problem than pinning down a solution.
The extras are interesting, too, including Moore's own detailed account of the infamous Oscar speech. He explains why he gave the speech, and after seeing the movie and hearing his explanation it's understandable why he gave the speech he did.",1065052800,6,790,4.859259259259259
1838051,4,B00008DDVU,"First, I liked this documentary/humor film, and I agree with Moore on some of his key political convictions and perceptions, such as the our government's enormous bias toward rich.
Having said that, however, I would like to make a few criticisms of this film.
1) Moore makes the interesting observation that in Canada (as well as most European countries) there are far fewer gun murders (per capita I assume). Then he points out that -- oddly enough -- gun availability and ownership in Canada is still quite high -- underscoring this point by going to a Canadian Wal-Mart (as himself, an American citizen) and buying (without any problems) lots of ammunition -- the implication being apparently that Canadians must have even more availability to guns and bullets than he did. (Evidently for an American to be able to buy a gun must be more difficult, but he doesn't go into that.). So far, so good, for this shows that having guns around doesn't necessarily turn people into killers, at least in Canada. He then shows how Canada has no slums, nor indigent people wandering around, since Canada takes care of the poor and disenfranchised -- an excellent point. Thus, the conclusion seems to be that this is why Canadians  don't kill each other like we do, and even don't lock their doors! Most feel ""taken care of"" -- and thus less fearful, even if guns are still relatively numerous. Again, so far, so good. But later in the film he seems to retreat from this thesis by implying that the real problem is -- after all -- the ready availability of guns, especially handguns, and drops the social welfare part -- especially during and after the interview with Charleton Heston. I don't get it -- is violence here due to both a) this ready availability of guns coupled b) with our callousness toward the poor, or is it just one of them? He seems to state at first that is must mainly be the latter (using Canada as a sort of proof), but then drops it. If he consistently postulated that perhaps America could drastically reduce its murder rate by leaving guns alone, and instead doing something about the enormous inequality our system promotes, maybe more people would be receptive to his message -- I don't know. Unfortunately he is vague on this, but should be commended at least for bringing the economic factor into the debate.
2) He brings up many of the foreign interventions such as our (U. S. A) overthrow of the democratically elected and very popular leader, Mossedegue (spelling?) in Iran in the 1950's, and his replacement by the dictator, the Shah. Likewise, Moore mentions many other of our imperialist crimes, like Vietnam. But when Moore mentions Guatemala, and the United State's overthrow of the democratically elected President Arbenz, he fails to mention that the dictatorship that the United States replaced him with proceeded to ban guns, limiting all such ownership to the police and military, leaving the poor Mayan population completely vulnerable. The government consequently proceeded to murder and terroize the poor for decades. Moore's argument and thesis would have been much more sophisticated if he mentioned this, and delved more fully into the issue. For Guatemala isn't the only example of fascists imposing gun control. While he briefly shows a sign at an NRA convention that shows other dictatorships that had/have gun control and gun registration (Hitler's Germany, Castro's Cuba, Stalin's Russia), he doesn't delve into it, nor mention the obvious fact of how many left-wing heros and peasents throughout history have felt compelled to use arms against murderous, thieving, fascistic governments (the Zapitistas, the Sandinistas, the East Timorese, the American Indians, etc. etc. ), and how perhaps they may have been more vulnerable if gun control had limited their ability to defend themselves.
Moore asks a right-wing radical at one point why he doesn't take Gandhi's path of civil disobedience.  Moore doesn't bring up the irony of gun control: spiritual pacifism (such as Gandhi's) is supposed to be a voluntary, non-coercive, volitional choice of the individual, (or a ""state of consciousness"" rather than a pretentious intellectual idea), and not something imposed by the muzzle of a government gun. Although Moore is ""thought provoking,"" he doesn't go deeply enough into this distinction between volitional pacifism and government enforced disarmament. .
3) Lastly, I feel that Moore should point out that, while European countries are generally far more ""progressive"" in having a welfare system for the masses, he fails to mention that many of them still are guilty of horrible imperialistic policies. England, for example, aided and traded with Indonesia during its 25 year occupation of East Timor in which 300,000 were murdered, despite being ""progressive"" with its own folks. Likewise, according to Noam Chomsky, ""progressive/socialist"" countries such as Holland, Canada, and Australia also were happy to remain Indonesia's ally (and make money as a result) despite Indonesia's blantant mass-murder policies. In addition, Canada still abuses its native peoples, robbing them of their land. Canada also imposes draconian sentences on those protesting the deforestation of its public lands. Thus, just because there are less murders in a ""progressive"" country, or has a more humane welfare system, doesn't mean that everything is ""a-okay."" Some ""progressives"" can still be downright murderous to other countries and peoples, even while being nicer to their own subjects, an important but neglected point . . .
Still, I enjoyed the DVD, and praise Moore for many of his perceptions.  The part about Dick Clark taking advantage of the system was very good.",1064966400,2,5703,5.123523093447906
1838062,4,B00008DDVU,"As my title suggests, I have mixed feelings about Michael Moore's latest work.  While I will admit to being a bleeding-heart, peacenik, liberal, I must say, this film is a little troubling.  I cannot stand talking heads, like the people on CNN and Anne Coulter (sorry if I misspelled it), screaming for blood just because people don't agree with them.  I don't think there are very many anti-Americans living in the country and it is simply rediculous to argue that people of the democratic, or otherwise liberal, ilk should be hung for treason.  Unfortunatly, it is this very same kind of propaganda I see coming from Mister Moore.  While his ideas are not so far out as Ms. Coulter's, I still fear anyone who can rally up so much animosty against any one group of people.  So to the point, I believe that the point the movie puts across is very admirable and must be exposed, but just remember to take it with a grain of salt.  Michael Moore has admited to being an entertainer before anything else, so it is safe to say that ""Bowling for Columbine"" is just that, entertainment.  As far as that goes, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is excellent.  It is perfectly fine cinnema and is a great choice for rental, or for buying.  So, just remember, enjoy the movie and even learn something from it, I don't want to totally discredit the film's value.  It is important for movies to appear that make us think and the one certainly does that, but don't take everything you see at face value.  Bravo to Michael Moore!",1064880000,3,1505,4.574626865671642

His humor and ability to show both sides of an argument are great aids and he used them to his advantage in everything up to this film.  The humor, though tasteful (not to mention pretty funny) takes center stage, leaving Bowling for Columbine empty of any legitimate cross-arguments from pro-second amendment activists.  Besides, put yourself in Heston's shoes.  If you had a rabid anti-gunner, (Moore who has every right to be so, God bless him) barking at you that your president of an orginization out to make sure anyone and everyone can buy a gun, how would you react?  Besides, editing can go a long way in making someone look bad.
I do suggest that EVERYONE see this movie.  If your anti-second amendment, you'll get great laughs and enjoy hating Heston even more.  If your pro-second amendment, you need to see what the other side is saying.  Besides, if you write this movie off as being bad just because it doesn't carry your own political views, than your just as bad as the people you oppose.

You may see a few bad reviews on this film, they probably have one star, and have a few sentences. Believe me oh brothers and sisters, these people are the main subject of this film and that is why they leave such rubbish. Those are the ones who have been conditioned by our media and have no knowledge of the grander scheme in which this film portreys.
Just by tackling the issue of guns (no this movie is not really about gun control) Moore presents to us the true face of America. Corporations own America. Corporations own America's political parties. Corporations own the media. Coporations own you. Corporations want more revenue. Corporations have little consideration for your mental stability, health or well being, or the rest of the world. All they see us as, is a consumer in which they can squeeze out a few more dollars. This is the true nature of this film. But the way it is presented is very entertaining and humorous.
I do think this film is biased, and he uses a figure that we know, Charleton Heston to be targeted as an enemy. This is one downfall of the movie, using an icon and reducing him to slime. Just realize that the Heston part of the film is highly biased, and is slightly inaccurate just for blames sake.
But when you see reviews that give this film one star, those are just right-wing ignorants that don't understand the US, politics or the fact that they are locked into their television, brainwashed and have no clue of what is going on in the world and the grander corporate scheme we're all locked into.

1838068,5,B00008DDVU,"In this documentary, Michael Moore uses his unique brand of wit to explore America's obsession with guns and violence. He depicts facts about our country's bloody past and present hitting the streets to talk to real people who are all in one way or another affected by guns. He makes you think as he tries to uncover why America has the highest death rate of people killed by guns in the world. I couldn't believe how different it is just to live in Canada. They support each other and have pride in who they are, unlike America's self-centered every-person-for-themselves attitude. The Canadian evening news actually talks about good things and their citizens don't live in constant fear. They had maybe 60 some gun related deaths in the past year to America's staggering 11,000 or so. Still, it isn't so much a film on gun control as it is a film on how we live daily in conformity, and how we are conditioned to believe things based on what we see in the media. He shows the sad stupidity of religious groups picketing a Marilyn Manson concert with the claims that Manson condones violence. But yet the hypocrites state that they won't let Manson in their city  ""not without a fight."" Moore allows Manson to share his views, which is something that a lot of people need to do,  just sit down and listen and find out the truth about things before passing judgment. Moore challenges each and everyone one of us to use our freedoms as Americans to try and change the oppressiveness of our country, to stop fearing diversity and to speak up and have a voice. The first step in doing this is to just turn off the television. Stop bombarding our brains with all the negativity, blood shed, and urban legends that is conditioned into us so that we remain living in fear.
With this, Moore won a much deserved Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The DVD includes a lot of extras including his feelings on winning the Oscar and about his Oscar speech.

I went into this movie, not exactly knowing what to expect. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a comic take on a serious topic, or a serious look at what's wrong with the whole gun-control issue in the US. What i found, was a combination of the two.

For example, he implies that the NRA's convention in Denver was scheduled after Columbine happened - the fact is that it was scheduled far in advance.  Mr. Moore completely ignores another fact:  Guns do not cause crime.  What causes crime is a decaying moral foundation, which is what we have here in America.  Guns have been widely available in this country for around 200 years.  There were no restrictive gun laws in place, and school shootings were unheard of - until around 15 years ago.  That's about the time when it became illegal to discipline your child, movies became more violent, and people have become more influenced by negative media (Marylin Manson, a has-been who makes an appearance in this DVD is one such example).  Mr. Moore misrepresents the NRA, attacks Charleton Heston (a man who obviously was suffering from the early stages of Alzheimers), and misses the point entirely:  Our violent media-driven culture has made people numb to the value of human life.  If guns didn't exist, murders would still occur (look at Japan, a country where guns are illegal and knife-murders make the headlines).  In contrast, look at Switzerland, where each household is REQUIRED to own a machine gun, and the murder rate is almost zero.  Where is this statistic in Mr. Moore's film?  By not addressing the root cause of violence, Michael Moore is part of the problem, not the solution.  This movie wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that people actually take him SERIOUSLY!  Well, since Rosie O'Donnell hit rock-bottom, the far-left needs another wealthy, lying loud-mouth to stir up the masses.

Moore is funny, cynical, caring, compassionate, scornful, and unflinching.  All of these attributes come across in `Bowling for Columbine,' a film that examines two aspects of American life: our relationship with guns and our fears of...well, everything.  Moore uses the tragic events at Columbine as a jumping off point to underscore and reinforce his thoughts that America is the most violent country in the world.  How and why did it happen?  Why does America have more deaths by handguns than any other country?  The examination of these questions is riveting and fascinating.
I'll never forget the disturbing footage from the school cameras at Columbine.  That's not the only disturbing footage in the film.  But there's also some incredibly funny scenes, one of them a cartoon chronicling America's greatest fears throughout her history.  But probably the most unforgettable scene is the interview with NRA President Charlton Heston.  I'll never forget how the interview ended and what happened immediately after.  Simple, but powerful filmmaking.
The film extras are many and are generally good.  The overall distraction is Moore's unending tirade against George Bush.  Whatever you may think of Bush, he is not the primary focus of the film.  So why does Moore spend so much time blasting him in the bonus footage?

And to those right-wingers spewing their racist venom, they are frankly wrong on all counts, stats are very funny things depending on where you got them and can be twisted for anyone's bias. ( Like white amerikkans are among the most violent white people on earth.) Frankly if all of us black men (or people) are so violent  as the right -wing intellectual/corporate media protrays us then give those  african-americans you people are afraid of as moore states in the film our own commenwealth state(like the u.s. virgin islands)in this country and grant us political automony,  all you have to do is lobby your congressman/senator and get 34 states to approve it.  This movie is brillant from start to finish you will laugh, cry and most important think for yourself buy this movie for yourself and a friend.

I originally went along with it and actually believed he was presenting honest and truthful information, but only giving his side of the story.  Since this however, an overwhelming amount of information has been uncovered that has shown that Mr. Moore went out of his way to decieve his audience and flat out lie.  For one, pieces of video of several different NRA meetings were edited together to make it appear to be a single meeting and creating an effect that he desired to ""prove"" his point.  The factory that produced the ""weapons of mass destruction"" made rockets to send satellites into space.  Much information is left out about the NRA's meetings in Colorado and Michigan, as well as lies being produced about them.  The list is nearly endless.

Michael Moore uses sappy music, and saavy editing to pull at the heartstrings while totally disregarding facts.
One such misleading fact is the number of gun murders he states.  While our gun deaths are much higher than countries like Germany, France, or Canada, it is actually smaller per capita according to FBI statistics.
Also, he takes only homicides for countries like Germany and Canada, but lumps justifiable shootings (cops shooting bad guys), and accidental deaths for the United States.
He blames the United State's welfare to work program for the shooting death of 8 year old Kayla Rolland by a classmate. He says the welfare to work program made the shooter's mother work, instead of stay home with her child.
He fails to point out that the boy lived in a known crackhouse, where numerous weapons were readily available along with drugs and passed-out drug addicts.

This movie pains a lot of individuals cause of the subject matter it deals with, and many would like to turn a blind eye to it.  Well, time to open your eyes, America.  Though, for some reason, even though Moore makes stirring films, it's a shame that it basically has changed nothing.  The public at large has already been brainwashed, and most forget once they leave the theater or turn off the telly that there is a world of hurt out there, and Moore is trying to turn a mirror on OUR society and say, here's the problem.  I hate to make analogies, but this film reminds me of that commercial where the fella is talking about quitting gambling, and the camera pulls back to reveal that it's him talking to himself in the mirror.  America, for the most part, loves to watch violence, myself certainly not being excluded, yet we do nothing to stop it, for the most part.  When we hear about it, we say what a shame, yet on the outside our actions don't reflect how most of us really feel deep down inside.  It's a conflict of interest to most.  Most would prefer to lock their doors and shut out the world, and Mr. Moore hits the nail right on the head with that one.  Most don't realize the world of hurt until it comes crashing down into their own worlds.  Violence and tragedy affect everyone, everywhere.  There's not much we can do, but we can change how we deal with one another, and that's a step.  Okay, so the DVD offers some great extras including Moore relating how he felt the night he gave his ""infamous?"" Oscar speech.

Bowling for Columbine strikes the hearts of its audience. Michael Moore goes out of his way to truly research and create a wonderful documentary on the history of violence and the impact it has on America, mostly by way of guns.
Michael Moore interviews various people, Charlton Heston, two survivors from the Columbine high school shooting, a few Canadians and Canadian authorities, and one of the creators of South Park.
Moore doesnt truly take a side until the end, he is mostly trying to help the viewer take a side. Not by pushing the viewer, but by asking questions, letting the audience form their own answers. That is what a documentary is all about. Delivering the facts to the audience. With such an emotional topic, Michael Moore does a splendid job with this.
The documentary shows how some people are off camera, when you expect human compassion and instead get the human that cares for greed.
Michael Moore has been called anti-american, because of this documentary. What is more unamerican? Trying to understand why the death toll in America is over 11,000 by guns, and in other countries even below 300, or letting people kill each other without saying anything at all? There once was a boy in a story who came home to his father. He said that another student had been picked on that day, and he said nothing, he didn't laugh. His father asked him: ""did you tell the other boys to stop?"". He was puzzled. ""No,"" he said, ""but I didn't laugh either."" The father looked at his son and said, ""by not saying anything at all you were agreeing with the boys who were tormenting the student. Even if you didn't laugh.""
Michael Moore is speaking out, and getting the information to the audience. He is not laughing. Yet he is not silent either.

1838133,2,B00008DDVU,"I know I'm gonna get dinged for berating this, but please hear me out.  I saw this movie with an open mind and afterwards, I did my research and found too many inconsistancies and falicies in Moore's movie Bowling for Columbine.
First off, he doesn't cite any sources what so ever during the movie, in the credits, or anywhere else for that matter.  And in documentaries, you cite sources otherwise your ""facts"" and ""anecdotes"" are just another story.
Seccond, I was not impressed with how pushy he was.  He came off as a jerk by pressing a mic right in front of Dick Clark's face without an appointment and expected an interview where and when he wanted knowing Clark would have to decline and would be in a hurry.
He also placed [a store] in a PR nightmare and exploiting the survivors of the shooting at Columbine to further his own agenda.  I think that is cold hearted and he does it on film!  Such [manipulation] and exploitation only made me more sick to my stomache, knowing Moore can go up to anyone, point a mic in front of their face and either make them do what he wants, or face the PR consequences.
Third is his questionable ""facts.""  ...  This makes me take off a star because a documentary should have irrefutable facts, or claim them as theory, and since Moore did not state them as theory and his facts have inconsistancies so I'm very skeptical about his work.
However there were some entertaining parts, like his humor.  I laughed a few times but it wasn't enough to make me like it.  All in all this movie is too questionable to be considered a work of art.",1064102400,28,1578,4.451388888888889

Not to mention he picked the fruitiest of fruit cakes to represent the American gun owner. This so-called documentary is one-sided and pathetic. It does not ""document"" anything. Rather it conveys Moore's opinions on contemporary issues. I don't mind Moore bashing King Bush II on his own time--I'm not a right-winger--but he shouldn't accept an Oscar for creating a great documentary when this film is pure fiction.

1838140,5,B00008DDVU,"In his latest film, ""Bowling for Columbine,"" Michael Moore takes us on a journey to try to answer the big question:  ""Why is America so violent?""  Is it the violent movies?  Could it be that we listen to a lot of disturbing music?  Maybe it's because we're too in love with firearms.  Well, as the film goes on, we find out that all of the other countries love violent movies, disturbing music, and guns just as much as we do (even more so, in some cases).  Interesting questions are brought up that offer new points that rarely have been discussed before (like the impact of news programs).  We get more insight into the ""Columbine Massacre,"" and the impact guns can have on a child.  What we get is an interesting ride that is filled with humor and heart.
Again, I'm no ""Michael Moore"" cheerleader; as I do not agree with him on everything he's said in the past.  However, I think he does a great job in his documentaries.  I even found ""Bowling for Columbine"" to be better than his first film, ""Roger & Me.""  You're not supposed to take everything that is said here to heart.  That's not what Moore wants at all.  The film's purpose is to bring up some different point of views and give us some very different questions that we have never encountered before.  In the end, it is YOU who decides what is going on and if you believe some of the things that are presented in this movie.

""Bowling for Columbine"" isn't here to offer you solutions.  Nor is it here to make you think the way Michael Moore thinks and feels.  In the end, it is only a movie, and nothing more.

1838164,4,B00008DDVU,"It is hard not to be partisan in reacting to this partisan movie. This is a movie in which the movie maker clearly has a mission and is not shy about admitting it --  to shock us into the acknowledging the frightful realities of gun ownership and lack of gun control, and disabuse us of fallacies which have been propagated by the gun lobby and their partisans. It may not be accurate to categorize Michael Moore's film as a documentary since he engineers much of the footage himself,  generating much theater to make some of his points. For example, he convinces two teenage victims of a shooting who still have bullet fragments in their bodies to return them to Wal-Mart where the original ammunition was purchased. So admitting this as a blatantly partisan work, why should we think it has value? I believe it is in its unrelenting refusal to accept pat answers to the reasons underlying gun violence in the United States. Moore very ably takes to task gun advocate Charlton Heston's claims of ethnic diversity as the root of the problem of gun related violence, by pointing to the ethnic diversity of Canada where gun related violence is all but unknown. He actually takes his camera to check the front doors of several homes in a Canadian town to verify assertions by its residents that their homes are never locked. This kind of cinema verite is potent. He similarly does away with explanations based on a violent history or violent entertainment in the United States, pointing to examples of similar phenomena in Germany and Japan where the gun-related deaths are a miniscule fraction of the United States.  This is not to say there are no factual errors or simplifications in the movie. But, whichever way you look at it, Moore makes it hard for anyone to not face up to the fact that the United States has little justifiable explanation for why its children face a multiple of the risk of gun-related violence compared to their peers elsewhere in the industrial world. It is a reminder of a troubling message and viewers should expect to feel some unease with this movie.",1063756800,3,2080,4.7245179063360885

So where is this hate coming from in the USA? Michael Moore says it's fear brought on by the people in power. I agree with this pretty much. George W. Bush did a wonderful job of scaring the living daylights out of Americans after September 11th. People lined up out of stores to buy guns and gas masks. He even scared the American people into a war with Iraq by making them believe they were out to get them and they had these weapons of mass destruction that they were ready to use at any moment. Americans are very persuasive people. Tell them to jump off a cliff and they just might do it. By the way, I am an American and I'm not bashing the USA. But I agree with Michael Moore and think there is a major problem in this country that we turn to guns and weapons and killing every time we get spooked. The interview with Charlton Heston is priceless. When he found out he had no answers for Michael's questions he just gets up and leaves the room like a coward. The problem I have with this film is Michael Moore seems to spin things a bit too much. When he was in Canada he tried to show how people there leave their doors unlocked. He went door to door to make us shocked that all the people left their doors open. The thing was, it was day time. Most people don't lock their doors unless they either leave their house or go to bed. I know my door is unlocked during the day when I'm home. So this isn't shocking when he walks up to a door and it's unlocked yet he wants us to believe it is. There are other facts Michael spins to lead people over to his side but an intelligent person can figure this out.

1838169,4,B00008DDVU,"After watching this film I felt the need to really probe my beliefs, and to ask questions not only of myself but of our society as well.  ""Why do we as Americans commit so much violent crime?"" is the question the film poses.  And I feel that it is definately a valid one, if not the most valid question one could ask about the state of the American world.  I completely agree with the stance that the film takes regarding the answer to this question, and that answer is ""fear.""  We have been taught to fear, (not only that which we don't understand) but any situation that we can not control.  And many would use this fear as a tool to control us.  I'm not a Marilyn Manson fan, but the guy is extremely intelligent, and what he has to say in the film pretty much sums everything up.  It is our fear that causes us to be led around, and it is our fear that ultimately will cause our demise and keep us lashing out at others.  Frankly, we are not living in a time where danger lurks at every turn, it is in fact quite the opposite.  Think on this for a second: (I don't care if you're a leftist or a staunch conservative) how would you feel if you went to a party or gathering and when you got there everyone was a different race than you were, and they are all the same race?  Wouldn't you feel a bit uncomfortable?  And why is that?  It is that we are afraid, maybe not of getting shot, but certainly of being a catalyst for violence.  It really sucks that this is the case, but there are people out there that want to hurt you, simply because they are scared of you.  For presenting this question and really making people own up to reality I feel that this movie is excellent, and in it's exploration of the subject it is worthy of five stars.  However,...
  The film is a bit hypocritical.  Where Moore basically sums up that guns are not the reason why people readily kill each other, and that it is a cultural/societal thing (his Canadian argument), he does a complete tailspin at the very end of the movie and almost directly places the blame on Charlton Heston's shoulders and the NRA's agenda.  I really disliked this because so much of the film before that point was extremely valid, and thought provoking.  But the Heston interview was basically just Michael Moore berrating Charlton Heston for heading up the NRA, like it was his fault that these children kill each other (that was in extremely poor taste).  This is not the case, by any means, in fact Moore points out this earlier in the film.  Moore also brings up the fact several times that Germany committed the attrocities in World War 2, but he doesn't mention that the first thing that Hitler did when coming to power was seize all of the registered weaponry.  The fact is, that people do kill people.  If this movie could make everyone change the way that they view fear in our society, then we wouldn't have anything to be afraid of, but, just because you haven't been attacked by a psychopathic killer in your home yet, doesn't mean you won't be.  Anyone who's ever been in a fight for no reason that they can ascertain knows this: that human beings are a violent species and are more than ready to dispense violence.  This film is not about ""gun control,"" and I felt that the jab at the end was on a misguided note, and wasn't congruent with the rest of the film which was really great in-and-of itself.
  Like I said earlier, I would have given this movie five stars simply because it is probably the most thought provoking film that I have ever seen, however, it putters out in power a bit at the end.  On a side-note, I loved the interview with the producer behind COPS, I thought that this segment was great and the guy had some real truthfulness behind what he said.  Matt Stone also had some very good things to say, especially about high school and how it shapes children.  By the way-side, for those of you that hate Marilyn Manson and think he's evil... he was beaten up and harrassed just like those two kids at Columbine, obviously this kind of hazing is the most anti-socially encouraging thing you could do to another person, and if you hate yourself you might start hating others.  So don't raise your kids to be jerks and perpetuate the cycle. -- Review by a Southern Californian 19-year old, so what do I know, right?  Peace!",1063411200,,4315,4.394206549118388

I fully believe that anyone who gave this movie a poor review, never actualy saw it, and just reviewed it solely on Michael Moore's acceptance speech.

However, I was surprised to learn that Mr. Moore is, in fact, a lifelone member of the NRA. I don't even believe that the word ""gun control"" ever appeared in this movie. I actually finished the movie a little bit closer to the middle of the pollitical spectrum. A Michael Moore film actually caused me, a self-proclaimed Socialist And I figure I'm in good company, with the likes of George Orwell and FDR in that same camp). Even Clinton takes about as much fire (no pun intended) if not more than George W. Bush in this film. Before I end this review, you may notice that I only gave it 4 stars, in spite of the act that, so far, I have had only good things to say about it. That one star was taken away because I think that a few of the facts in he movie were distorted. But hey, at least his distorions of the truth don't cost he lives of American soldiers. And he never stole the Presidency. Okay, Ican't get over it! So I enjoy the Constitution! That's not a crime yet is it? *Is dragged away by Rumsfeld's Thought Police* Okay, so maybe it is...",1063238400,4,2434,4.225321888412017
1838182,2,B00008DDVU,"How long is Michael Moore going to be able to do this type of documentary? My guess is, that at some stage, people are going to be onto him. The segment with Charlton Heston is the most glaring case-in-point. He hounds Heston's people for an interview, finally gets some camera time with him and then totally submarines the man. I guess he's counting on Heston's having joined the Ronald Reagan Lost Recall Brigade. How else could Heston not have known going into the interview of Moore's muckraking past? Might it have had something to do with Moore's positioning himself as a longtime NRA, card carrying member, an undying gun enthusiast? Is that not at least a middling form of dissembling and misinformation (which Moore accuses his opponents of doing?).
  I'm not by any means a fan of the NRA. The fact that Heston went ahead with those rallies in Denver and Michigan is despicable. I'm just not into filmmakers' engaging in dishonest subterfuges in hopes of getting someone to look bad on camera. I'd also have to add that the guy can at least think on his feet. When his big crusade against K-Mart towards the end of the film entirely fizzles, when big, bad, corporate K-Mart shows it has a human heart, Moore parades about and lauds himself in one of the most self-aggrandizing displays I've ever seen on film . Sorry, much as I agree with many of the points he's trying to get across, this film and his Oscar acceptance speech marks him as a not-so-much-as-rent in the future.

1838183,5,B00008DDVU,"When I first purchased this DVD, all I knew was what I had seen of Michael Moore at the Oscars, which at the time made me furious for questioning the war in Iraq.  I felt and still believe that we needed to get rid of a madman who was slaughtering his own people and was a threat to the world.
What I found when I began watching Bowling for Columbine was not some demon left-wing commie, but someone who loves America, is part of the NRA, and who genuinely wants to find out why Americans seem to be so violent.  And then I watched as Moore tore down the typical reasons given: less guns in other countries, less ethincity, less bloody histories.
I have always had my own opinion of why it happens, as I'm sure everyone has, and this movie reinforced my own beliefs as I'm sure it enforces others in different ways.  I am the last one to point fingers, but I see it every day.  Americans seem to be obsessed with death.  Whether it's rubbernecking at an accident, watching the evening news reports, we seem to be fascinated with the misery of others.  I am guilty of this, and I do not blame anyone else.  That is one major problem I see and what I believe is a primary reason here.
We in this country love to blame others for our woes, both personally and collectively.  We armed Usama bin Laden against the Soviets, Iraq against Iran, and watched them turn our own weapons on us as well as their own people.  But it is not that simple.
It's easy to blame the media, but they are simply giving the public what they want to see.  Are video games and violent TN shows the culprit?  Tell that to Ed Gein or Albert Fish.  I don't remember Hitler owning a Playstation.  Marilyn Manson?  Simply theatrics, did Mozart inspire the Nazis?  We have a bloodthirst and a detachment from others that transcends all this.
I was here during the horrible riots in downtown Cincinnati.  We still suffer repurcusions of that.  I volunteered with fear in my heart to be a tutor and a mentor in the Washington Park area downtown, right in the heart of where the riots took place.  And dammit, it still makes me nervous to go there.  Have I ever been threatened?  Not even close.  The children are wonderful, people are helpful, and once I get over the jitters I see that it is not what it has been made out to be.  But violence is a commodity that sells in the United States, and as long as we keep buying the hype it will not cease.
I do disagree with Michael Moore's politics at times, as I do many others, but I can see that his heart is in the right place.  If we had more caring people trying to make a difference instead of living in fear, perhaps we could bridge these gaps.  I know that despite these deep-seeded premonitions that I may always carry due to conditioning, I'm not giving up on those kids in Washington Park.  I still love my president, and support him as a patriotic American, but healthy debate is what makes us the democracy that others in repressed societies admire.  Don't ever stop going after the truth Mr. Moore, though we may not vote for the same person, we do have a common goal to make our country better for everyone.
And to the conservatives out there, if you pass over this documentary as I almost did, you are only hurting yourselves and possibly your country that you love so much.  And to all the victims of our countries imperfections, you will not be forgotten.",1063065600,6,3384,4.364217252396166
1838184,3,B00008DDVU,"Like Rush Limbaugh and Al Franken, Michael Moore is an entertaining propagandist, but that's about it -- an ideologue flailing away at one of the most important issues of our time. He thoroughly fails at his mission of finding out why Americans kill each other with guns and instead descends into the leftist mantras of America's the world's great Satan (sometimes deserved), NRA bashing (also sometimes deserved) and ""inanimate objects made us do it"" (let's get K-Mart). He even totally loses it and tries to blame one killing on Dick Clark.
Moore uses his standard tactic of bushwhacking people with a camera and creative editing (fun but ultimately pathetic). That Chuck Heston was dumb enough to let Moore anywhere near him with a camera, blows my mind. I guess he really does have dementia.
Ironically, Heston's ill-advised musings really do touch on a HUGE factor in America's gun violence rate as compared to other countries -- one that Moore is completely unable to recognize or explore because of his own bias. I'm talking about black-on-black inner-city violence. Few people, especially an agenda-driven leftist like Moore, are willing to point out that if you remove unfortunate inner-city blacks from the murder statistics, America's gun murder rates are about the same as Europe's. It's sad, true, and thoroughly un-PC to mention it. In total denial, Moore even suggests that Canada with its much lower gun-violence rate is as ethnically diverse as we are, which is absurd (Canada is 13% non-white, 2% black).
Obviously, this does not mean that we do not have a problem, and there are a large number of social/historical factors that figure into why the urban black portion of our society is suffering as it is. However, it does make one wonder about the quality and objectivity of Moore's ""investigation.""
Moore hardly even mentions the inner-city crime issue, but surprisingly Heston does (indirectly). Moses obviously has thought and read quite a bit about our gun-related social woes (God, I would hope so). Unfortunately he did not have the forethought or finesse to explain it to Michael. I suspect that even if he had (maybe he did), the tape would have wound up on the cutting room floor -- smug, pseudo-Nazi, gun-lobby leaders are far more entertaining and in keeping with Moore's agenda. In short, this film is more about justifying Moore's poorly thought-out opinion than about exploring the issue.
It's also important to understand that the film's centerpiece, the horrible, graphic school shootings, have little effect on our murder rate. They create media frenzies (especially when they involve whites shooting whites) but they are a very small part of the picture. FAR more kids drown in pools (around 300) in the USA every year than are shot by their classmates at school. To his credit, Moore did quite nicely touch on the media distortion factor.
In summary, this movie is worth watching, and it's quite scary or funny on occasion. It makes some good points. Just make sure to take it with a grain of salt the size of Montana (you know, that state full of white gun nuts).",1063065600,6,3103,4.969230769230769
1838185,5,B00008DDVU,"First, let me say that Bowling for Columbine is one of the most engaging movies I've seen in a while. As someone who has grown up thirty minutes from Moore's hometown of Flint, I have always had an affinity with Michael Moore's work, but Bowling for Columbine strikes me as far superior to anything this director has done before.
Bowling for Columbine, though it definitely has an agenda, strikes me as being more even-handed than Moore's previous film and television work. I loved Roger & Me, but Bowling for Columbine is so much broader in its scope and reasoned in its execution.
Moore does not, as some have suggested, slam or use the ""tactics of guerrilla journalism"" on the people who come off looking really bad (James Nichols, Lockheed Martin, Charleton Heston) in this film. He hands them the rope of his questions and lets them hang themselves with their own words and actions.
Bowling for Columbine's simple documentation speaks more eloquently about the state of American politics than the hundreds of schills and pundits on the evening news. In Bowling for Columbine one can visibly see America's descent from freedom and liberty into a state of fear and despair.
As much as I love my home state (Michigan--which comes off very poorly in this film) and my country, Bowling for Columbine makes one thing crystal clear: it is time for a change. The politics of hope and reason must win the day against George Bush and the politics of fear and death.
I give Bowling for Columbine a FULL five stars.",1062979200,21,1508,4.759541984732825

1838187,1,B00008DDVU,"When many people hear the term, ""documentary,"" they assume that the film is absolutely factful and truthful, thanks in part to the excellent efforts of The History Channel.  But, in this case, I think those people have been duped.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" deals with an issue that is so large and complex that it cannot be successfully dealt with in a movie of any length.  There are so many variables involved in gun violence that any gun-control documentary must delete, generalize or distort the information beyond accuracy, truthfulness and usefulness to society.  Consider just a small sampling of the possible variables that an accurate, reproducible scientific study would have to include:
1) population density (urban vs. rural areas-many more people own guns in rural areas, yet most gun-violence occurs in the metropolitan areas)
2) racial/ethnic violent crime rates (most gun violence is due to underage gang bangers from black, latino and other minority ethnic groups)
3) the effect of literally thousands of different gun control laws affecting thousands of jurisdictions (walk from one city to the next and the gun control laws change--what effect does this have on criminals?)
4) gender/age/income differences in the crime rates (lower income young black males are the most violent, upper income elderly white females the least violent)
5) ownership/legality of weapons used (most gun crimes are committed by repeat offenders with stolen guns)
6) what about the estimated 2 million times a year guns are used to prevent crimes?
and the list goes on--any documentary that addresses gun control accurately and truthfully would literally be years long!
Michael Moore, in order to add more emotional influence to his documentary, selectively presented just a tiny fraction of the variables involved in studying gun control, just to support his particular point of view.  Think about it--Charlton Heston is only one person (a leading figure of a large organization); he in no way is an accurate statistical representation of the millions of gun-owners (law-abiding and criminal) in America.  Likewise, a few striking examples of gun violence--no matter how tragic--aren't enough to draw an accurate conclusion about this huge issue.  This is unacceptable behavior from a documentary maker and does a great injustice to the now-misinformed people of America.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" is the sort of emotionally-charged fluff that is perfect for the outspoken rabidly-anti-gun Hollywood elite to use to strengthen their unscientific point of view.",1062892800,21,2555,5.402010050251256

1838189,2,B00008DDVU,"Admittedly, in our society, there is nothing criminally wrong about being a hyper-leftist focused on advancing one's agenda.  Michael Moore, a college drop out, decided to create a film exploring the ""root"" causes of the Columbine disaster, which exploits to advance a political agenda he held before the crime occured.  The irony is that Michael Moore provides ample evidence a nation of ""gun nuts"" (his term, not mine) is not to blame for the Columbine disaster.  For instance, he admits that Canadians have lots of guns, and, considering their low murder rate, that is not to blame for the high murders in America.  Thus, it is a bit of irony that he tried to pick on Charlton Heston, president of the NRA, a man who was just trying to have a nice conversation with an apparent ""reporter.""  Michael Moore's apparent conclusion as to why murder rates occur in the United States has to do with a lack of socialism--""free health care""--in the U.S.
If Moore wanted to seriously consider the gun argument, he would have called John Lott Jr., author of ""More Guns, Less Crime.""  He is an articulate spokesman for the notion that more guns will result in less crime due to the way criminals use incentives to control their behavior.
Michael Moore also makes many irrelevant connections between items that have absolutely no connection to other items.  Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, is apparently near the Columbine High School site.  So?  Moore brings up this connection without providing one single shred of evidence that one is connected to the other.  He thinks that by saying a defense contractor is near the school that it will result in one thinking that defense contractor sites encourage children to kill.  In fact, they do not.  If that were the case, we would at least see national statistics suggesting that such correlations exist.  I'm sure Michael Moore would be happy to show them.

1838212,5,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore is a very brave man. Not since Bill Hicks did an American dare to speak out loud and directly about what he/she thinks is wrong with their society. While Hicks did it through his stand up routine, Moore is doing it through docu-films and books. After finding a comfortable niche on TV with TV Nation and The Awful Truth, Moore crowns the fruits of his more than decade labour with a docu-film, the core of which is about the tragedy of the Columbine High School massacre and the gun control debate that ensued long after,but is wider in scope to include the much more complex issue of finding or trying to explain the roots of the violence in US society.
There are several points of interest in the film.
The statistical comparison of the crime rate he made between the US and other developed country is something that baffled him and many of his interviewees, even Charleton Heston who was the cherry on Moore's cake (pardon the pun!),securing the interview that ends the film. I was really surprised by how little information and facts Heston has on the crime rate issue. I would have imagined the president of NRA would be more informed and learned about a debate that he has come across a zillion times,and not just repeating the same old diatribe and cliches!.
Of course we get no answers, either from the Columbine tragedy, because the two kids responsible shot themselves and the reason they decided to commit their horrendeous act died with them, nor we get any answers about the roots of the wider crime problem.
Gun ownership seems one, but then we get the impression that in Canada there are millions of guns out there, with a European crime rate. The emphasis on Canada in my opinion was a bit long, and the fact that Canadians do not lock their doors was over emphasized and a bit naive and unrepresentative of the core problem.
Another very interesting angle in Moore's film, is the fearmongering he talks frequently about,the 1984-ish atmoshpere of fear mainly instigated by the media. While, there are  conspiracy undertones to his theory which I am not very comfortable with,it does present some valid points to ponder on.
The political angle of the film is typical Moore. His anti Bush, anti American involvement in the foreign wars and the innocent lives that were lost as a result, is in my opinion something which he should be praised for, not because I agree with what he says or not, but simply because like Hicks he has the courage to highlight hypocrasies that many people know about but ignore. And to that end, no matter what the subject is ,it is stance and a rare courage that I applaud.
I know a lot of people attack Moore for being unAmerican and unpatriotic for (as they say)trying to hang a dirty laundry that should remain buried especially to the rest of the world because the world out there does not need more ammunition to critisize/attack/hate America,a very sensitive area especially post 9/11. But I believe that Michael Moore is a true patriot. Patriotism is NOT about pride, but rather about love,care and concern for your country. Moore is concerned about the violence, the high rate of crime, the things that he alledges are done by the politicians in the name of the ordinary people, and this is where the source of his frustration  and the need to go out there and film it or write about it come from.
The important issue about Moore is not whether you agree with him or not, it is rather about somebody who has a lot of interesting things to say in a democratic environment. Voltaire once said: I am against you till death in every word your say, but will defend till death your right of saying it.(roughly translated).So for those who think Moore makes sense, and is brave in saying what he says,it is good to know that there is actually someone speaking for many,and for those who think he is damaging his own country by what he says and believes in, then they should thank God for living in a democracy, when if a different opinion is voiced, it is not a sign of unpatriotism or dissent, but a platform for debate and exchange of ideas.
So Bowling for Columbine is as a result a very important film. It not only discusses issues that you may or may not agree with, but it makes you think. This is what Bill Hicks strived to put across, and this is what Michael Moore is now doing.",1062720000,4,4345,4.583547557840617
1838213,5,B00008DDVU,"Love him or hate him, Moore asks the kind of questions that, once you've heard them, you can't ignore.
Is the NRA an association for good guys or bad guys?
Is Charlton Heston a bigot or a man with strong personal opinions?
Was the Columbine massacre inevitable or avoidable?
Does Marilyn Manson actually make more sense that the people who hate everything about him?
Is Canada, so different from America, and if so, what's the real, deep down reason?
Are gun laws alone the root cause of all of America's social problems?
These look like very worthwhile questions to me, and it's my belief that Moore does us all a favour by getting us to think about them.",1062720000,3,656,4.567796610169491
1838214,4,B00008DDVU,"I wish I'd taken the time to go all the way to the ""artistic theater"" in my city to see Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" last winter.  Instead, in waiting for the DVD, I've had my reaction to the actual film blunted by Moore's antics at the Oscars, and, to a degree, by all the ""extras"" in the second disc of this set.
You start out believing this is a film about gun control.  Don't get me wrong, I think that is what Moore had in mind.  But as he meanders through the facets of the issues (and he does it admirably), the most compelling question arises...when did Americans start having to be afraid to live here?  When did the violence in our society begin to affect the way we feel about our lives, and what role does the media play in sensationalizing the dark side of society and underplaying what is good about America?
I've read the scathing reviews here about how Moore's film is ""not really a documentary"", just a film piece to portray an unanswerable question and the issues from his point of view.  OK, you're right about one thing.  It's not a documentary, it's a thought-provoking film.  So, it didn't really HAVE a category in the Oscars (kind of non-fiction films???)and shouldn't have won the award.
Moving right along, it is doubtless that Moore filmed more of a ""spoof"" of some things than a true nonfiction piece...the vignette about the bank that gives away guns and the ""History of America"" presentation.  Moore's scene with Dick Clark and his editorializing about Welfare to Work -- neither one of them should have survived the cutting floor.  What he needed to present was the thought that many children get involved in violent acts and come to possess guns (and drugs, etc.), because their time with thoughtful parental mentoring is limited.  That's true, but for reasons far more numerous that because of ""Welfare to Work"".
For most of the film Moore acts like a reasonable artist, and invokes thoughtful and insightful scenes, like the dialogue with Marilyn Manson, with Matt Stone, with the principal at the Buell school,in a fair presentation of the Michigan Militia, in much (not all) of the Heston interview and in the coup he pulled off by nonviolent protest at K-Mart headquarters in Troy, Michigan.  Moore never tells us why Americans are so afraid, because he admits that he doesn't know, and that no one really seems to know why, or how to negate the fear.
Moore's film is fascinating, but Moore dilutes his message, and reduces its meaning, by his own actions.  His interview (on the ""special"" second disc), with Charlie Rose is memorable, but the rest of the disc is Moore sounding off.  It seems that Moore can, for the most part, conduct himself appropriately to make sure his message is heard when he is filming, or when he is talking to someone of equal intellect.  Taken out of those parameters, he feels he has a bully pulpit for all of his views about what is wrong with America, whether they are germane to the film or not.  His sarcasm and seeming glee at the fact that he can say whatever he wants, truly reduce his effectiveness.
With that said, ""B for C"" must be seen.  Try not to watch the second DVD.  While I preferred ""Roger and Me"", the poignancy of
""B for C"" and the questions it raises (which will hopefully be followed by some solution-oriented actions by the nation) are memorable and provocative.
A fine film, a fine effort.  Next time, Roger, don't make the second disc, and don't make speeches.  Go to political rallies for those.",1062633600,2,3499,4.650974025974026

1838217,5,B00008DDVU,"A Film by Michael Moore
Winner of the Academy Award for Best Documentary.
Michael Moore does a good job of both informing and entertaining in this documentary.  Moore takes a look at the gun culture in America and tries to find out reasons why there might be so many gun related deaths in America as compared to any other country.  As with other works of Michael Moore, he takes some facts and details and makes an emotional case and an emotional argument for his position.  This is something to keep in mind when watching (or even reading) Michael Moore.
The film takes a look at the rabid gun culture in America, but as it investigates the most common arguments for why there is so much more gun violence here than in, say, Canada, Moore is able to give strong arguments against those common explanations (we have more guns, history, diversity, movies, etc).  The movie also looks at the Columbine shootings (showing actual footage and using 911 recordings) and also looks at some of the history of America.  In some places America does not come off looking very good, but America's history is not a pristine and spotless history.  The film is both educational and entertaining.
Some people have questioned details in Moore's film.  From everything that I have read, Michael Moore stands by the details in the movie.  I am not knowledgeable enough to say who is right and who is wrong, so I'm not even going to attempt to break things down point by point.  Even so, it appears to me that Michael Moore is trying to make more of an emotional impact than a purely logical one.  This is both the greatest strength and weakness of the movie.  It is definitely one of the best of 2002 and worth watching.",1062633600,4,1701,4.599337748344371

1838219,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine is a fine documentary, as far as the art of the documentary is concerned--good camera work, juxtapositions by montages, scene building, and even some traces of a plot--but its point of view is slanted to the point that the film loses, consciously one must admit, all sense of objectivity. Rather, the object seems to place practically all guilt for the shootings on gun ownership and the NRA. It is also determined to debunk Charlton Heston, laying on him the onus of insensitivity, and even stupidity. Moore, doubtless, is presenting his film as an indictment of the the far right and its obsession with guns, and he is honestly concerned about the violence and the carnage in this country, blaming it all not just on the mentality of some people and groups of people but on the right to own guns. It is not people but guns that kill people. While all this is abundantly documented (without actually violent scens one might expect), the film only gives superficial explanations as to the causes that produced the killings. The comparisons are given between countries with extremely low crime rates (Australia, Germany, Japan, and others) and America--comparisions overwhelmingly depressing if you are American--do little to offer insights into this horrendous gap. A documentary has to have a point of view,and this one does: I am against guns, and the NRA is the major culprit, Moore says. Yet, the documentary, meritorious as it is on a certain level, fails to offer a truly insightful and convincing reason why ""we"" are what we are; to say that the NRA (and Heston) share the blame for the carnage is one thing; to fully explain where the desire for gun ownership comes from is another.",1062547200,2,1728,4.901023890784983

I was more than a little concerned to find that the movie uses a number of deceitful techniques with editing to strengthen Mr. Moore's position.  Before you watch this film, I think it's good to research it a bit, then go in with open eyes.  I hope this will help some of you.",1062547200,13,385,4.026315789473684

1838242,3,B00008DDVU,"This is a great documentary on the issue of gun control in the USA.  As a proponent of some sort of gun control, I think Moore nailed this aspect of the film by showing the widespread availability of hand guns and automatic weapons, and the gun culture that is America.  He begins with a hilarious bit about a bank that gives away a free gun when you open a checking account.  (What happened to toasters?).  His use of media images of military bombings, murders, and the infamous Columbine tragedy, highlight the need for some sort of control in this arena.  The depictions of media creating fear at every turn was excellent, as if we needed any more reasons to not trust everything the media throws our way as reality.
However, the film quickly derails into often absurd and even embarrassing tangents.  Perhaps the most glaring of these illogical assertions is that somehow the ""work for welfare"" program in Michigan is at fault for a 6-year-old who kills a classmate with a loaded handgun brought from home.  The music played during this stretch was beyond an obvious attempt at some sort of victimhood celebration. His attempts to corner Dick Clark as a cause, because a restaurant that bears his name employs some welfare recipients, was a complete embarrassment to Moore and anyone who would buy into such tripe.  His attempts to play racism, and play to the victim mentality of the liberal left were sad and pathetic.  What started as a needed and apolitical message about violence is somehow now related to Moore's socialistic worldview?  He really lost me here.
There are a few other interesting aspects he explored.  He takes two of the Columbine victims to the K-Mart headquarters to protest the fact that K-Mart sells bullets.  (The Chris Rock sketch on bullet control is worth the price of admission alone, and is a better solution.)  What Moore seems to forget is that his beloved Flint, Michigan's main manufacturing product was automobiles, which through misuse kill more people than all the bullets sold at all stores combined.  Would he protest one of those places?  Even more absurd is that fact that he states to Charlton Heston, leader of the NRA, that he Moore is in fact a member of the NRA!  Moore even shows him his membership card.  Then he proceeds to try and blame Heston for the killing of the 6-year-old?  Did anyone actually miss this blatant hypocrisy?
Overall, this is typical Moore work.  His attempts to demonstrate the problem of gun use to kill others in our culture, as it compares to the rest of the free world, was excellent.  However, in the end, Moore offers no solutions, plays the victim aspect to the fullest, and leaves the viewer with nothing more than an inside look at his socialistic agenda. One gets the impression that Moore really has no idea how to solve these issues, nor what their cause is, beyond implementing a program of socialism or communism.  A wasted effort, which could have been a much-needed message on gun control.",1062460800,6,2982,4.773879142300195
1838243,3,B00008DDVU,"I wish I could split my rating - because this movie can be divided into two parts.  The first hour and a half was extraordinary.  Moore managed an honestly objective look at the subject, exploring with what at least appeared to be an open mind the reasons for the gun-death rate being so high in America.  Many good points were made and sound arguments brought out (I was particularly interested in the argument about the negetive re-enforcement of U.S. news media and how they and their advertisers use fear to sell their own newscasts and the products they advertise).  Truth be told, no one makes a pseudo-documentary like Michael Moore!
However, as he often does, Moore manages to throw away any good points he earned with the first half by drowning the final thirty minutes of the movie in an attempt to lay the blame for Columbine and other shootings at the feet of K-Mart, Dick Clark, and Charlton Heston!  Moore's style in these segments echo the more irritating portions of Roger and Me - the idea tha because someone says something stupid (or refuses to speak at all) when a camera is suddenly shoved in their face, therefore they MUST be to blame for all of society's ills!  Moore needs to learn a little respect for other people if he is going to try to be a mouthpiece for the causes he believes in.  Like I said, I think he has alot of good things to say, but these guerilla-camera tactics draw attention away from the good and instead reveal what an a**hole he can be.  I mean - what's the deal with the whole Dick Clark encounter?!  Let me lay this out for you - a 1st grader shoots another 1st grader.  We learn the gun came from his uncle's house.  The kid is living with his uncle because his mother cannot afford to house him or put him in day care.  She can't because she is on welfare and expected to (I believe the word he uses is FORCED TO) work outside of Flint in Dick Clark's such-and-such restaraunt.  So what does Moore do?  He heads right out to interview Dick Clark, and stands in appaled shock with that ""shame-on-you-Dick-Clark"" look on his face as Clark refuses to talk to him and drives off.  See what I'm saying?  The fault for the shooting is laid on Dick Clark  because a restaurant he's probably never stepped into which happens to have his name on it hired a woman whose son stole his uncle's gun and shot a girl?  That's Dick Clark's fault?  Where is the interview with the school for the gun making it into the classroom - how about interviewing the mother for being so removed from her son he would be led to do such a thing - how about intervieing the uncle for having a home in which a first-grader could even handle a gun, much less take it out of the house!
What's worse is the commentary track by his interns and assistants.  Kudos for a great idea, letting the ""little guy"" talk for once.  But the result here is just a Michael Moore fan-club.  The kiddos on the commentary clearly worship the ground he walks on and hope to be him when they grow up.
So - FIVE stars for the first portion of the film that is a credit to Moore and all who worked on the film.  But ZERO stars for the final act in which Moore sabotages his work and the work of those who helped him by being pretentious and trying to earn a few extra viewers with ""controversial filmmaking.""  That averages to about THREE stars as a total - and even THAT is generous, considering!",1062460800,6,3394,4.376395534290271
1838244,4,B00008DDVU,"Yes, this DOCUMENTARY is not perfect, but no documentary, film, or any piece of work for that matter is. And as far as him not being completely objective, of course its not. Complete objectivity is impossible. Subconscious bias exists in a medium such as film or news(as Moore points out in the film). Therefore, I have no problems with the way Moore protrays the events. I actually think that his portrayal is quite insightful. He doesn't claim to have concrete answers to the problems, which can be a problem not just in documentaries, but in non-fiction writing as well. Instead, he takes an honest look at the problem. He does a good job of tying events together throughout the film. One of the best things about the film is the way that he is able to tie violence in America to greater social problems(The Beecher School shooting and the Welfare to Work Program is the best example and one of the better parts of the film). While he is sensationalist in some cases, he does a good job of not trying to attack innocent parties(The Michigan Militia was portrayed quite neutrally and is a good example of this.) His segment on the scapegoating in the media was terrific as well and he does a great job of breaking down the myth of the ""Sinister American Culture."" Another good example of this is the fact that the only violent music movement that I can remember occured in Norway where National Socialist and Racist/Fascist bands led by Varg Vikernes burned down 50 churches and at least two murders were tied to the movement(Read Lords of Chaos by Michael Moyinhan). Yet, both Norway and Scandanavia have one of the lowest rates of gun violence in the world.
  However, one part that upset me was his portrayal of Canada as a sort of modern utopia(and this is coming from someone who loves Canada and is planning to move there.) For example, the buildings that he calls Canadian slums are not Canadian slums at all. Read the East End Plays by George F. Walker and you'll find that Montreal has slums just as bad as the US. He also tries to portray Canada as non-racist, and while multi-culturalism is more prevalent in Canada, there are in fact a lot of problems with racism(particularly against the Natives, but also with the assimilation of other cultures and racist immigration policies that are even worse than the US). Another problem with portraying Canada is that the Provincial(State) governments hold more power than the national government, creating very different environments from province to province. Alberta is as conservative as the US, while Quebec is extremely liberal(Ontario is Moderate Conservative). For more info on Canada, read Reflections of a Siamese Twin by John Ralston Saul and Fire and Ice: The United States, Canada, and the Myth of Converging Values by Michael Adams.
  Nevertheless, I can't necessarily fault Moore for this, as it would take years to do an accurate documentary on Canada. Like I previously mentioned, none of this weakens his argument, nor is that important to the film(I feel the existance of slums and racism actually strengthens his argument). He does a great job of stirring debate and portraying the complexity of violence in America and throughout the world. This should be an absolute necessity for anyone who cares about discovering our American identity(as much as we like to deny it, that includes violence). The interviews were also extremely intelligent and well-done. This work is both disturbing, yet inspiring. I thank Moore for both his courage and his determination to seek the truth behind such as complex issue. An absolute classic!",1062374400,2,3604,4.883986928104576
1838245,5,B00008DDVU,"I saw this movie knowing little of Michael Moore and his ideas... I knew the general ideas but never read or saw any of his other material...
This movie begins from Moore's own questioning of WHY did the Columbine killings happen. I sense Moore is a man who truly loves his country and is raising questions to begin a dialogue and thought about the issues he cares about.
In his journey of giving us the facts, he discovers and points out:
-Americans citizens do not have more guns than any other country, Canadians have just as many as we do.
-Japan is the worlds capital of violent video games.
-Germany bred the Nazi party... we are not a more violent society..
yet we have a substantially higher percentage of killings with guns by citizens than any other country in the world... and this is the point Moore tries to discover thru this movie... this is something not completely analysed and revealed in the movie I felt... but more of a statement of fact of the statisics and his thoughts on the media, fear and commercialism has dumbed down our country to the point where we are scared of each other...
I am a fan of Marilyn Manson but had never heard him speak on issues and was well suprised by his genuine talk with Moore.
Bowling for Columbine should be watched by everyone of us who care about the state of our country and consider ourselves to be patriots. Conservative or Liberal the views and facts Moore presents should be considered.",1062374400,4,1448,4.551724137931035
1838246,3,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine is an entertaining hour and a half. But as the credits roll, you'll begin to have doubts about its value as a piece of journalism or, for that matter, even as a political polemic.
It certainly demonstrates the power wielded by a documentary maker. That curious feeling that comes after an argument that's gone badly - ""If only I'd said [Insert witty but devastating rejoinder here]"" - must be something Moore's interviewees feel en masse. Moore himself doesn't have that problem: with the benefit of hindsight he can (and does) supply his own explanatory commentary, and he edits and de-contextualises statements made by interviewees with whom he doesn't agree.
Such sleight of hand is very hard to spot (though the dead giveaways are very brief, fractured interview excerpts) and impossible to unpick from the viewer's perspective.
What can be unpicked, however, is Moore's logic. The order of the day is innuendo, double standards and bias.
Moore (quite correctly, in my view) pooh-poohs Marilyn Manson's responsibility for influencing the Columbine gunners, pointing out the lack of causative evidence for the link and arguing that the killers were just as likely to have been influenced by the trip they made to a bowling alley on the day of the shootings (hence the title of the film). But without drawing a breath, Moore suggests that instead we should look to US foreign policy for the reason - Columbine occurred on the day of the US's most heavy bombardment of Kosovo. You can't have it both ways, and imagining these particular adolescents having any idea about US foreign policy is laughable.
Similarly, we are told Columbine is nearby the factory, in Littleton Colorado, of Lockheed Martin, the world's largest weapons manufacturer. Well, *a* factory, at any rate. What we're not told is that the factory manufactures no weapons, only weather and communications satellites. A hapless company spokesman is interviewed in front of an enormous rocket-like thing, which (though Moore doesn't mention it) is exactly that: a rocket, for launching satellites. Moore describes it as a ""Missile of Mass Destruction"". In any case, the likelihood that the location or existence of this factory, weapon producing or not, triggered the Columbine shootings is surely low.
Moore makes many statements which have no probative value and can only have been included for the prejudice they would dredge up in the viewer: we are informed, for example, that the National Rifle Association was founded in the same year the Ku Klux Klan was criminalised. Exactly what point Moore thought he was making here is not clear. Winston Churchill was born and there was a fire in Chicago in the same year, but Moore doesn't mention these. Both are about as relevant.
Moore is inconsistent in his attribution of blame for the crisis and eventually just gives up. Given the amount of time he spends pursuing Charlton Heston, you would think that the NRA is his main target. Indeed, it seems to be, though by the conclusion of the film Moore has almost conceded that the NRA mantra - it's people, not guns, who kill - is pretty much right. He makes much of gun crime statistics in which the handgun murder rate in the US is measured in tens of thousands, against mere hundreds in European countries, and Canada. It's very difficult to verify the statistics, which are widely cited, but he points out that Canada has almost as common gun ownership as the United States, but only 130 murders a year. Which would suggest that gun ownership (and therefore the NRA) really isn't the problem.
When pushed on this point, the NRA trots out what Moore clearly considers the old chestnut that America has a history of violence. Moore makes the counterpoint (repeatedly during the film) that Germany, Russia and France all have violent histories, but nothing like the US's gun fatalities. The fact of the matter is that Europe's history of violence has generally been a case of state perpetrating it on the population and not the population on each other, and at any rate it has generally been profoundly political in nature. The American history of violence (until very recently) has been neither.
Moore also spends some time on the case in Flint, Michigan where a six year old took a gun to school and shot a classmate. This he blames on right wing politics; the child's mother having been forced to work for welfare and so not on hand to see her child packing its gun for school. Moore corners Dick Clark, at whose bar and grill she was working at the time of the tragedy, to no obvious point. Wisely, Clark shuts the door of his van and bids his driver depart at once. The shooting looks for all the world like a tragic accident, and had little if anything to do with trickledown economics, and certainly wasn't Dick Clark's fault.
At the end of the day, this is a very entertaining but highly disingenuous film. I don't think you could call it a piece of journalism, nor really a documentary, as it is so frequently wide of the mark as to enter the fictional realm - sometimes lazily, but I suspect sometimes maliciously.
As long as you watch it with a healthy sense of scepticism it isn't a bad night in.",1062374400,17,5199,4.829596412556054
1838247,4,B00008DDVU,"Unlike some, I found the basic truth behind Michael Moore's documentary to be profound and could stand up the constant digs people make regarding his editing techniques and inherent liberal bias. Maybe turnabout is fair play (tell me that Hannity, O'Reilly or Coulter are 'unbiased' and I'll show you a flying pink elephant), maybe it isn't, but regardless, the film does make you think a fair bit about the nature of fear. It also forces the viewer to dig deeper than the normally glib answers given to explain violence, particularly gun violence, in America.
Plus, just to clarify something, the K-Mart stunt didn't only get HANDGUN bullets off of the shelves of one K-Mart, but rather it effectively got K-Mart to remove them from their entire chain of stores. HANDGUN bullets are meant for the purpose of KILLING other HUMAN BEINGS. They're purpose is not fulfilled in the sport of HUNTING. Shotgun and Rifle ammunition can serve this purpose. 9 mm semiautomatic pistol rounds are the tools of killing people.
Sure, anyone can go kill someone with a Ford Bronco or even a kitchen knife. It is a bit funny how killers seem to like choosing the good old fashioned gun more often than not.
Moore Recognizes that in a country mad with fear and panic, perhaps we shouldn't be so-armed. Maybe you shouldn't be able to go down to a K-Mart and buy bullets for a 9 mm handgun so easily. Maybe your kid shouldn't be able to do such a thing.",1062374400,2,1434,4.67193675889328

I only wish to point out something that I haven't seen in many of the other reviews I've read.  Moore does, in fact, give an answer to the question of ""why does the United States have so many more gun related deaths than any other country?""  The answer, if you follow the movie closely enough, is fear; The fear that the media instills in us on a daily basis because it makes for good ratings.  This media bias seems to be much more prevalent in our American society, and seems to be the only majorly dissimilar aspect of our country, as compared to others.  I suppose the more fearful you are, the more likely you are to feel threatened and have to ""defend"" yourself from someone else, even if the threat isn't real.
Also, it was quite funny to see Charlton Heston put his foot in his mouth right on camera, and then try to backpedal so he didn't look like the bigot that he is.
Basically, I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind.  Even if you're not very open-minded though, this movie should still make you think about the current state of the country, and that can't be a bad thing.",1062288000,3,1299,4.260162601626016

  The ""What a Wonderful World"" sequence should be required viewing in, say, high school...where our young'un could get some ""fair balance"" against the recruiters who will swear that war is an adventure; a way to be all you can be. Including killer and atrocitor, I suppose...
  A SUGGESTION:
  Since Michael Moore and those on the left-center side of the dial are more interested in truth than money, at least in our present configuration...I'd suggest doing the following:
  ENCOURAGE copying and distribution of the film, vid, DVD, etc.
Have no FBI warning at the beginning, but instead state that you have given permission, a blessing, to copy and distribute freely.
Even include a blank tape with every purchase of the product.
  You may want to make a statement about where donations could be made...but making money is not the bottom line. That is the other folks. And they would never do this...wanting to such up every available nickle, instead. Think ""Hundredth Monkey""...

  As far as healing America, and the sad cancer that seems to infect every adminstration...another story altogether. But Michael is certainly doing his part, as a good Michael will, archangels that they are. Let's hope the man who yanks the reigns from the current incompetence can steer our ship back to clear, clean waters. The lies are forming a thickening stew through which light may not, one day, pass.
  By showing us how the Media-Industrial-Military Complex manufactures fear and causes for fear...just to make a profit -- and by showing that we do not have to succumb to the faux fear --
Mister Moore has opened a window where light can, and does indeed, pass.
  Perhaps what we really should fear, if we need to fear at all, is what we, as a nation, an empire, has become. And how we got, and stay, that way.
  The problem with ""our system"" is that it doesn't include the notion of TMM, or ""Too Much Money"".  How much is too much money? Well, if you have to kill for it, it is too much. Time to downshift. ""A wise man distributes as he receives."" This is his, or her, protection...and worth. Guns are for chickens and hoarders. Fear not, wise bodhisattvas!
  May Time give this gift of Moore a thousand wings. And we...a thousand tongues.

1838260,5,B00008DDVU,"A friend recommended this Michael Moore documentary when it came out on DVD. Unlike most people, I'm not that familiar with MM's previous work (with the exception of the tame ""Canadian Bacon"", his attempt at a comedic satire) and I was mostly oblivious to the hype surrounding this film. No disrespect to the friends and families of those lost in Littleton but I felt that ""Columbine"" had become an overused media buzzword. I had little interest in ""Bowling for Columbine"".
After watching this film, I truly regret not seeing it when it was in the theatres. This is great stuff, people. Whether you love or hate Michael Moore, ""get"" the point of this documentary (a lot of people won't), once you start watching this, you can't stop. Highlights?
The interview with Marilyn Manson. He comes across as intelligent and articulate. He really should consider running for Congress once he's done making crappy music.
The interview in Charlton Heston's pool room. Chuck seems amiable, courteous and a bit misinformed until Mike asks him why he hosted an NRA convention in the town where that little girl was shot.
The scene at K-Mart. ""Returning the Merchandise."" Wonderful stuff. I had tears in my eyes.
The security cam footage from Columbine. If you can sit through that without wincing and you're American, you've been desensitized by a media that thrives and feeds on fear.

1838261,3,B00008DDVU,"This movie has some good points, some bad points and some real ugly problems.
GOOD
*  The best point made my Michael Moore is that the liberal media uses scare tactics to help push fear into the homes, hearts and brains of susceptible people. A terrorized public is of course the biggest tool of socialism.
*  He points out that Canadians also have a high gun ownership percentage without the resultant crime. He asks why but never answers this important question 
*  The presentation that the liberal media portrays crime as being black induced while the majority of Americans do not.
BAD
*  A completely false representation of NRA policy of children and guns; whos responsible.
*  His theory that the columbine shootings were inspired by the Kosovo bombings is a little ridiculous?
*  Michael Moores incessant comments that people should not work.
Working has no Merit
What is the point of working
Working causes children to shoot other children
People are forced to work
*  Falsely implying that a single parent with one child who made $40,000 - $50,000 a year was poor.
UGLY
*  The betrayal of the Lockheed-martin plant making Nuclear Missiles. The plant makes rockets for space exploration. This is such a blatant falsification, you cant possibly call this a documentary. It is more of a mockumentary in the lines of Spinal Tap.
*  Moore consistently asked why we are (Americans) different. But he never once examined the two perpetrators of the columbine shooting. The Home Security consultant probably asked the most pertinent questions in the whole program but it they went unanswered.
Why were these children so viscous?
Why such predatory action?
Why did they do this killing?
*  Moore states that we will never know why they did it He never once examines the diaries that detailed not only how but WHY these two boys did it.
*  Moore never once mentioned the boys targeting of Christians and their almost metaphysical hatred of any person who proclaimed an affinity to Christianity.
*  The extremely false history of the United States. Why was this cartoon placed into this movie? One really has to wonder about Moores hatred of this country and why he felt it so necessary to put America down.
In the end you have left with a very vapid felling inside after watching this show. It answers no real questions and it gives no solutions. It seemed like a piece of propaganda without the propaganda.
Moores little escapade in Canada where he shows how safe it is by how many people leave their door unlocked is one example of this shows lacking substance. But just to see if it is any different I just went around my neighborhood. I live in what has been called the murder capital of the United States. Our city has the ignoble fame of having the highest amount of murders per inhabitants for 4 out of the last 10 years. The citizens here should be scared out of their minds.
Out of 8 homes 5 had their front doors unlocked.
Of the 3 that did not 2 people where not home and at the third a 15 year old babysitter was at home watching the kids.
1 out of the 5 doors that was unlocked, nobody was home.
Sorry Michael, you could have had a great movie here, you could have tried to get some problems solved. Instead you come away as a insensitive brat, who is using the columbine tragedy to help line your bulging pockets.

Moore tries to get to the bottom of the reasons for the Columbine massacre, and he uncovers a nation that is pumped full of fear needlessly and is therefore driven to fill their houses with guns to feel secure instead of addressing the issues behind the fear.
The fascinating film concludes with Moore receiving an interview opportunity at Heston's Coldwater Canyon mansion -- and this alone makes the film worth viewing.  However, there's even more to it than the memorable interview.  It just may shake you to your very foundations, if you're open-minded enough to receive his important message.",1062201600,8,735,4.864

1838264,1,B00008DDVU,"Other then a headache and a mild sense of bewilderment, the only thing I got from Bowling for Columbine is a sense that Michael Moore is a huckster and a shameless self-promoter.
While trying to verify some of Moore's facts, I became confused as to whether Bowling is supposed to be taken as a serious documentary or a psuedo-docu-comedy (PDC).  And, having seen both documentaries and PDC's I'm not even sure Bowling is either one of those.  I'm not even sure it can be called a film, unless you go with the  ""to become coated or obscured"" definition.
Bowling's greatest weakness is a lack of focus.  In both documentaries and PDC's, there is generally one subject or a group of subjects connected by a common event/experience/belief.  If Bowling has a subject, I would guess it has to be Moore.  Unfortunately, Michael Moore is not a very interesting subject and nowhere near as witty as he must think he is.
Moore spends the running time aimlessly wandering between Flint MI, Columbine CO, and L.A. CA.  He seems to focus on gun violence and the question of why so many American's kill other Americans (presumably with guns, but it never clearly established if Moore is talking about murder in general or murders involving guns).
Random facts are thrown at the viewer presumably in support of whatever Moore's argument is. Or maybe its just to throw random facts and the audience.
It could just all be the white man's fault.  In fact, a short cartoon blaming white male Puritans for slavery, the KKK, the NRA, and the current murder rate in the U.S. (once again, presumably gun related murders) is about the only coherent part of this mess.  In fact, I think this cartoon short is the only thing that qualifies as a film in the ""movie"" sense of the word.  Anyway, white men are blamed for slavery, U.S. white men in particular, and no mention of any other country's involvement in the slave trade is made.  It is not even mentioned that slavery is still going on today.  Black on black slavery in Sudan and all kinds of sex slavery all over Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
Moore does have a point on how the U.S. news media and politicians scare the American public into a state of learned helplessness, and he claims the same is not true in Canada or Europe, but he never goes anywhere with this point.  Maybe a simple comparison of the U.S. and Canadian constitutions and the role the press is given by each might have been instructive, but Moore, in his eagerness to blame America first, never takes the opportunity.
The movie is called Bowling for Columbine but the only thing documented is Moore's, and by extension, the U.S. left's descent into bitterness and schizophrenia.  The only true highlight is an edited and all too brief clip of South Park:  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.
If this is the best argument the facist/socialist factions living in the U.S. can make for gun control, then Americans will be bearing arms for a long, long time.  If there's some other argument being made here, good luck in finding it.
I give Bowling for Columbine 1/2 star for the inclusion of the South Park clip which helped me to remember that there was a reality outside of Bowling for Columbine.",1062115200,20,3193,4.664884135472371
1838265,5,B00008DDVU,"I happen to be a diehard liberal.  I don't find that Michael Moore is in any way biased, except against politicians.  He is too busy focusing on the inherent violence of American culture to worry about taking sides.  He is a genuine American hero, not afraid to speak his mind to reach his intended goal.
Otherwise, this film is funny in spots and makes me cry in others.  It is so powerful that I would show it to a high school class and my redneck family regardless of the consequences.  Any one telling you that this is a partisan film is dead wrong.  This is a film about Moore's genuine concern for America.
Oh, and watching Heston make a fool of himself made the film worthwhile.  It's not like Heston was in a position to defend himself.  He's just not there anymore.  It does, however, say something about the NRA.
Keep in mind that I don't agree with everything Moore says, and I have my own numerous and varying theories about violence in society.  Watch it and agree or disagree.  I don't care.  Just quit the status quo bickering about common sense and realize that intuition is not always correct.  As one of my law professors once told me, ""practice humility, you may learn something""

1838267,5,B00008DDVU,"Ultimately, Michael Moore fails to answer the question that is essentially the basis for ""Bowling for Columbine"": why are Americans so violent?  There are no easy answers to that question.  Moore centers the film in Littleton, Colorado and the shootings at Columbine High where he tries to make sense of the senseless.  It's a difficult task.  Moore travels to Canada, where there are millions of guns but few gun-related deaths.  Why? The viewer is frustrated, along with Moore, that this question cannot be answered.
Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, whose fans included Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, is interviewed by Moore, and displays more intelligence and empathy than he is given credit.  What would he say, Moore asks, to Harris and Klebold?  Nothing, Manson replied.  ""I'd listen to them.""
Sure, Moore takes some dramatic license in the film.  The opening segment has Moore at a bank that offers a free rifle for opening an account.  The piece is edited to look as if Moore got the gun right away, which he didn't; he had to wait for a background check.  But that's really a non-issue, as Moore illustrates: how absurd is it for a bank to give guns to customers?  Another segment has Moore purchasing ammunition from a barber shop, as he gets a haircut.  All of it ties together to the fact that guns are everywhere, readily available to anyone who wants them, and lots of people are dying because of it.
Other segments center on the NRA and it's then-president, Charlton Heston.  Moore is granted an interview by Heston at his Hollywood Hills estate.  Heston has no answers, either, on the subject of gun deaths, other than the fact that the U.S. is of ""mixed"" ethnicity.  Heston has lots of guns.  Not that he needs them, with his well-guarded home.
In the end, Moore raises many thought-provoking points, but offers few answers.  Unfortunately, there aren't any.",1062115200,6,1890,4.871473354231975

I have heard many critical reviews but mainly from people who are just afraid to even begin to conceptualize the problem.  I bought this DVD when it came out a few weeks ago and have already watched it twice, both times with equal fervor and excitement. Michael Moore has completely hit the nail on the head with this production.  Also, the ""history of the United States"" within the movie is not to be missed. Truly a hysterical and historical look at the racism, violence, and bigotry which runs through the United States' blood today. Three cheers for this movie.",1062115200,3,665,4.666666666666667
1838279,2,B00008DDVU,"Ever seen Le Mans with Steve McQueen?  That movie was created around 24 hours of footage taken from McQueen's (real) race car while he was driving in the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans.  The movie was created to use this footage to make a great racing movie.  I think they succeeded.
Michael Moore didn't.  I just couldn't help think ""What's the point?""  I finally realized that Moore had sold himself out.  He created a film with such noble pretenses to address the violence rampant in our society and cheapened it by making strange political statements throughout the film.
He bashes media hyping violence to get ratings, and in the same film shows a downright disturbing montage of video clips of people blowing their brains out.
He ambushes and attacks Charlton Heston on Camera to make a weak point that the NRA doesn't care about violence. Isn't it a bit unfair that Moore is picking on a man that wasn't prepared and is barely able to think coherently?
I'm mad at this film because it touches on the issues of media hype, a culture of fear, a lack of respect for human rights and dignity and the senseless violence we Americans inflict on each other.  But then Moore goes and uses these same things to get butts in the seats in his theaters.  I couldn't help but think that Moore is just a man with a camera who likes to make himself look smart, and the poor subjects of his camera look really stupid.  Well he almost succeeds at that.
The real jewels of this film are in the special features.  The interview with Charlie Rose is especially interesting.  I, for one, am more moved by Michael Moore the concerned citizen speaking to an intellectual equal than Michael Moore the on-camera preadator alleging that the NRA was created because the KKK became illegal in the 1870s.
It's in these features that you realize how lost this movie is.  Do yourself a favor and watch these BEFORE the film.  Moore wanted to make a movie to address violence in our society and get to the roots of why people kill each other.

I was able to see Bowling for Columbine while visiting Columbus last year. Unfortunately it was not being played here in the backwoods of West Virginia.
I think that every American should be required to see this film. Especially the montage of facts and newsclip set to ""What a Wonderful World"". If you have any illusions that the American government is there to protect and serve us and help the world, see this film.
Even if you aren't an American, it's a great and thought provoking documentary. I won't give away details, mostly because there is simply too much to talk about in the film.
But it made me like Marilyn Manson even more, lose respect for Dick Clark, hate Charlton Heston so much I want to set him on fire, and it made me want to move to Canada. The film had some very hilarious scenes, but in the end it made me very, very sad about this country. Some people cried during the movie, I just felt ill.
Oh, there's a shot of Katie Sierra, the West Virginian high school girl who was expelled for starting an anarchy club. She now works at my husband's office, telemarketing to raise money for the police. Ironic, eh?

In addition to that, Moore's interview with Heston is also incredibly powerful, as Moore put the NRA President under a lot of fire.

He embarks on a quest with a closed mind and a definite agenda to portray any given situation in a specific light.  The resulting piece is biased, full of distortion, and contains a large number of out of context statements and events that are portrayed in a manner that best suits the message that Mr. Moore is attempting to transmit.  It is unfortunate that he does not produce a product that clearly examines the issues in an unbiased and open manner.
Mr. Moore's style of ""Reporting"" or ""Journalism"" is quite clearly a throw back to the days of William Randolf Hearst and the the muckraking yellow journalistic style that actually caused our country to wage war on another nation through the distorted presentation of events, conversations and out-right falsehoods as fact.

1838284,5,B00008DDVU,"This film by Michael Moore is a documentary on the subject of gun control. After the columbine shooting and other acts of gun violence in schools, Michael went out to find the causes and effects of these trageides. While searching for answer to why these events happened, Michael asks the greater question about Gun Control.
Statistics show that over 11,000 Americans die each year from gun shots, while just about every other industrialized naiton on the earth has a gun fatalty rating about 10% that number or less. Why is this?
The question of ""Are Americans gun crazy, or are we just crazy?"" becomes the topic of the film. Michael follows the stories and documents the actions/reactions of professional social psychologists, police chiefs, television producers, friends and family of shooters and thier victims, Chariltin Heston (the current head of the NRA), and even Marilyn Manson.
Some may not like this film, saying that it is slander against the Republican party, but politics is touched on in a very odd way that shined a bad light on both the Republicans (who gave pretty poor excuses in trying to justify the deaths and lack of gun control) and the Liberals (who really failed to make any significant changes).

1838285,2,B00008DDVU,"I gave ""Roger and Me"" 5 stars, but I think this is a much lesser effort from Michael Moore.
First, here is what makes Roger and Me great: irony and tragedy in parallel.  Moore is a genius at putting people into ridiculously ironic situations - for example, filming four rich women golfers, none of whom have ever worked a day in their lives, calling the auto workers ""lazy"" as they take tee shots.  Ronald Reagan brings the workers out for pizza and advises them to move to Texas, and then leaves without picking up the tab.  As Roger Smith, CEO of GM, makes a Christmas speech, fired auto workers are evicted from their homes.  The movie makes its point in a roundabout way that works with people across the ideological spectrum - and still leaves plenty of room for debate.
Bowling for Columbine is a different story.  There's still some of Moore's irony left, as when James Nichols (Terry's brother) says ""there's some wackos out there!"" after pointing a gun at his head and convincingly sounding wacko himself.  And the Lockheed Martin exec standing in front of a gigantic missile as he discusses how anger management would have helped with Columbine.  But here Michael Moore tries to find a solution to the problem of violent crime in the US.  It seems for a while that the solution is going to be, ""restrict guns,"" and the evidence is rather convincing.  Until Moore reveals that Canada has relatively unrestricted access to guns, but a tiny fraction of the US's murder rate.
After this, the movie seems to go off in too many directions.  If this is true about Canada, why is Moore intent on stopping the sales of handgun ammo at K-Mart?  He never explains (although I think there could be a plausible case).  He ties American violence to a ""culture of fear"" spread by the American media.  But this seems no more convincing than the idea that Marilyn Manson is spreading violence through similar media, and the theory that American media is so much more fear-driven than Canadian media seems doubtful.  The movie ends with Moore speeding through many more unconvincing and irrelevant theories: about ""Cops"" being racist, about workfare causing an accidental shooting, etc.  Bowling for Columbine simply doesn't have the irony and dark humor of Roger and Me, and spends too long on unconvincing solutions.  Moore makes a weak attempt to substitute Charlton Heston for Roger Smith, but winds up making the old man look sympathetic with his relentless badgering.  Moore comes off looking as simple-minded as those who would criticize him: his solutions are no better thought through than his opposition's.",1061856000,23,2608,4.851015801354402

His information is fraught with misunderstandings, misinformation, and misdirections leading to an overall cornicopia of ignorance. He harasses numerous people including KMart and Charleston Heston in a sad attempt to be profound.  He acts as if those people perpetrated the crime themselves and should be held responsible, when in actuality they had the most minor of roles to play if any at all.

1838298,5,B00008DDVU,"Yet another brilliant flick from Michael Moore, in the same league as his ""Roger and Me"" skewering of General Motors' premeditated and royal screwing of Flint, Michigan.
Moore tells it like it is: that we Americans live in one of the most deeply psychotic societies in the world.  Our standard of living may be one of the best, but our quality of life is close to nil in comparison with that of other First World countries (Canada, Japan, Scandanavians, the UK, etc.)---not when 90% of the populace is brainwashed by a capitalist-driven media and right-wing ideologues in both government and industry, so that we live in a state of continual fear and compulsive consumerism.
Yes, Moore does take a few liberties here and there with statistics (neglecting to compare murder rates between different industrialized countries on a per-capita basis, for instance---but either way the US is still way way ahead of everybody else).  But overall his portrayal of America is just spot-on: we are a nation of control freaks who are out of control, a bunch of dogs barking at mirrors and chasing their own tails.

1838303,4,B00008DDVU,"Outspoken documentary filmmaker Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" is both an outrageously funny and a profoundly sad look at gun violence in America. Our nation has the highest homicide by gun rate in the world, and Moore tackles this issue with his usual free-wheeling style. The movie has few answers to the questions it raises; indeed, Moore often seems perplexed by his subject matter.  That doesn't matter much because the movie stands as an invaluable documentation of a particular moment in our history. It also promotes debate on why we, citizens of the richest, most powerful nation on earth, seem hell-bent on shooting one another.
As a kid growing up in Flint, Michigan, Moore learned to hunt with a rifle. He has been a member of the NRA for decades. I mention this to assure viewers who firmly believe that that all Americans have the right to own guns that Moore doesn't necessarily disagree. The message I got was that he, especially after the massacre at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999, now questions just how much we really need all these firearms. He demonstrates how television news today is geared to keeping us scared, despite the fact that crime has declined. He takes us to Canada where there are also lots of guns but where the murder rate is much lower. [Many Canadians don't even lock their doors!] He takes us to Japan and Great Britain where kids also grow up on violent movies and video games. Homicide rates in those countries are also exceedingly low.
Some of the funniest scenes show Moore at a bank that offers a free gun for opening an account. Some of the most poignant involve two young men who were wounded at Columbine. They accompany Moore to the corporate headquarters of K-Mart, where they attempt to get refunds for the 17 cent bullets still lodged in their bodies. [The bullets used in the shootings were bought at a Denver K-Mart.]
At times, Moore seems to be all over the map. I think this is because he trying to cover as many angles on the subject as he can. The result is one of the most fascinating documentaries ever made. Highly recommended to everyone on both sides of the gun issue.",1061683200,3,2150,4.6878306878306875

I don't like George Bush, and I believe he's creating a bad reputation of America as the world's bully nation with his attack on Iraq based on what I call Magic 8-Ball premonitions of possible actions against America in the future.  That said, I am also a gun owner and wouldn't consider for a moment giving up my guns.
This movie's facts in regards to the number of gun murders in the United States versus the other countries of the world should make anyone step back and ask themselves ""Why?"" Michael Moore takes us on a tour of what fuels the fears of Americans to motivate them to purchase weapons. We visit Colombine High School in Littleton, Colorado in the film, and Moore gives us some examples of extremes people go to in the efforts to prevent another massacre. We visit Flint, Michigan, and we learn about one 6 year old boy shooting a 6 year old girl in their classroom. Granted, most Americans find it inconvenient to think about the social aspects of our culture that do not help these stomach turning consequences, we must recognize how abnormal our relationship with violence and ""preemptive strikes"" truly are.
I'm proud of Michael Moore for researching and showing us these events, though he may emphasize shock value a bit too much here and there - for example, the Great Lakes Crossing Mall is in a wealthy county in Michigan, but it is more or less an outlet mall in a very middle class/GM factory worker town. In a democracy, we can still love the USA and support our troops while questioning what we do - to call such questions unpatriotic is vitriolic and similar to an authoritarian view.  Until we're forced to wear Chairman Mao hats in this country, Michael Moore reminds us that we need to step out of the routine to recognize what has changed around us.",1061683200,11,1840,4.569696969696969

Moore simply patched together a series of dubious stats and out of context file footage. His goal was to frustrate the political right with lies and to fuel the fire of ignorance on the political left. He succeeded.
And when his integrity is questioned, Moore immediately counters with a flagrant ad hominem attack. He says that everyone who discredits his movie is a `right wing zealot' with malicious motivations. He will not even entertain questions about the truthfulness of his so called documentary. His only defense is the fallacious statement, 'All of the facts in my film are true.' No crap!

1838335,4,B00008DDVU,"While there are no words, nor is there any film that can alleviate the hurt and the sorrow that the people of Littleton, Colorado carry with them every day, talking about ""why"" is imperative to the healing process.  Having asked this question to himself, Michael Moore began looking into the culture that could birth such a violent incident.  This film travels through Moore's own thought process into what he believes is the root cause of much of the violence in society today: Fear.
Mr. Moore believes that the United States was born of fear, and that the culture of fear is a catalyst in the American propensity towards violence.  The murder rate in the United States is ten times that of our neighbors to the north, and a rate several times that of many other western nations.  Many of these countries have far fewer guns as the citizenry is not allowed to possess firearms.  Canada, on the other hand, is much like America in that a person can own a wide assortment of guns.
Moore's previous works were more concise and collected; more to the point.  Bowling for Columbine was Moore coming to his own conclusions, not having them completely formed in his own mind.  This made for a somewhat scattered film at times, but it also made for a film that was very human; very real.
Problems came in the fact that Moore often asked questions of people who really could not answer.  Some inquiries could not be answered for business reasons and some for the fact that the questions themselves were simply unanswerable.  While many of the concepts, people, and organizations that were brought into question in the film, were brought up for valid reasons, the attack on K-Mart was simply out of line and sensational.  Moore was guilty of his own criticism and used media tactics to corner the retailer into submission.
Aside from the few minor contradictory issues that came up through the film, it was spectacular.  Bowling for Columbine brought into question the systemic reasons for the violence in America.  He brought light onto the idea that the culture of fear is perpetuated by the media and by the government. Some of the most insightful moments of the film actually came from shock-rocker Marilyn Manson.  As one of the primary targets of the religious right during the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy, Manson was amazingly understanding of the people, and expressed his feelings over why violence continues.
One of the most memorable concepts that resonated throughout the film was that of the NRA's tendency to arrive in areas in the wake of terrible events.  The NRA came to Denver within a month of the Columbine tragedy, and then within a week of the shooting death of Kayla Rolland in a Flint Michigan elementary school, even after pleas for them to stay away.  Charlton Heston and the NRA showed an amazing amount of insensitivity in their presence in these places.  While they have the right to be there, it showed how far they are willing to go, and how much they really do not care who they hurt in their wake.  They refused to give a grief-stricken community time to heal.
The film did have its problems, but it was amazingly powerful.  It was very emotional. Though it was apparent that this film was a ""work in progress,"" while Moore himself sorted out why he thought there was such excessive violence in America, it came to rather concise points.  This is a film, no matter what a persons political beliefs are, that should be seen.  It will provoke thought, one way or another.

Gun related deaths per year.
Germany........381
France...........255
Canada..........165
UK.................68
Australia..........65
Japan..............39
USA........11,127
But these statistics are not misleading, unless you think that the countries concerned have the same populations as the USA. Does anyone here believe that Japan, UK, Australia, etc. have the same population as the USA?
Numbers adjusted to reflect comparable populations with the USA.
Canada.......1,320
Germany.....1,143
France........1,020
Australia........780
UK...............272
Japan..............78
USA........11,127
As you can see the closest contender is Canada with almost 12% of the deaths that USA has. Total these inflated numbers and all the other countries listed only equal 4613 deaths per year. This is 41% of the total deaths per year that the USA suffers from.
Micheal Moore doesn't attack the NRA. He doesn't ambush anyone. He asks fair questions. He balances the issues. I thought I was going to see 2 hours of extreme left wing propoganda. I was very happy that this documentary didn't meet my expectations.",1061510400,4,1420,5.734597156398104
1838361,4,B00008DDVU,"I get the feeling from reading through some of these reviews (both negative and positive) that they were left without the writer ever seeing Bowling for Columbine. Many of the 5-star reviews simply support gun control, which I didn't feel was the focus of this movie. One the other hand, many of the 1-star reviews are somewhere along the lines of ""Michael Moore is a fat pinko who is working for the Soviet Controlled United Nations. He made Charlton Heston look like a jack@ss, boo hoo."" or ""This movie is full of bias and socialist propaganda, just check out Rush Limbaugh's page on it"". The bottom line is that there is misleading info in this movie.

 The tally of gun deaths, which lists America's gun violence as dozens of times higher than other countries is not based on a per capita measure, it is based on overall numbers. After the adjustment, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, etc. end up having only about eleven times more gun death then we do (at most). Does this statistical issue make a world of difference? I don't think so, but apparently a few right-wing writers do.

All the sites I have seen go into the errors in Bowling For Columbine have made the argument that the Lockheed Martin plant depicted in the movie does not actually make missiles for the military. Lockheed Martin's website disagrees, however. If the plant did not make these missiles, would the PR guy in the film discuss the purpose of these missiles? I think not. The most ironic part of this argument is that there is a large metal rocket in the background of the PR Guy and Moore's bit which has ""United States AIR FORCE"" written on it.

I can go on and on about the issues I have with the ""Bowling for Columbine lies"" pages, but after addressing a few of my problems, I would only like to add that every one of those pages I have seen is more than 50% ""The implication of this scene is..."" followed by some interpretation I just could not fathom getting from the movie. The bottom line is that Bowling For Columbine is about the culture of fear in America, and how many mentalities may be noble, but nonetheless dangerous. It is an excellent compilation of witty and interesting insights to a problem Americans cannot ignore. I choose to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the film doesn't seem to flow (to me), it just seems like a collection of different pieces centered around one ultimate idea.",1061510400,,2391,4.579439252336448
1838362,1,B00008DDVU,"I don't know what to say, but this was a complete waste of my two hours.  There was absolutely no point to this ""documentary"".  Moore has offered his audience nothing new to the gun debate.  Moore ,whom I enjoyed on T.V. nation, has really lost his focus.  What was the whole point of him going to missile manufacturer?  How's that revelant to the debate?  Was it cool to pick on a guy who is suffering from Alzheimers?  Heston may be the figure head of an organisation that is odious to the far left wing, but he is still a human being and deserves some respect and compassion.
I belive Moore is just using his position to get rich!  All I ever see him doing now is railing against white males.  Does he actually have any solutions?  Anybody can pick apart an administration, or the ills of society.  It is something quite different to actually propose solutions.",1061424000,16,864,4.4743589743589745
1838363,4,B00008DDVU,"This documentary of Michael Moore's search for answers to the Columbine massacre takes a hard look at the gun culture in the United States.  While the arguments Moore presents are not backed up with enough solid evidence to make it a true scientific study, he does make a few undeniable points on the United States culture.  The questions raised in this film are far more important than the facts given.
Being a Canadian, I think his comparison between the United States and Canada is a little misleading.  Canada is not a utopia of friendly and safe people, but then again, I can't remember the last time I locked my door.
Overall, this film is probably as biased as the people it is meant to criticize, but you cannot deny that Moore has a point, which is important to all Americans to understand.  From an international perspective, I feel a lot of other countries will misinterpret much of this movie to maximize the faults of the US.  I feel that a country which can recognize its own faults (however unwillingly) is better off than one living in a falsely perceived utopia.
At least this film will force the US government and citizens to do something they have not done in quite sometime.  Think.
Perhaps one day other countries will follow Michael Moore's example.",1061424000,2,1271,4.702702702702703

1838366,5,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore has done an excellent job at asking questions nobody in the press seems interested in pursuing. In this documentary, he asks why Americans kill one another at a rate far greater than other countries?
What's amazing is how Moore gives some of the characters space to speak their minds and they succeed in almost hanging themselves. A spokesman for Lockheed who's standing in front of an ICBM sees the Columbine massacre as a ""microcosm"" for whats going on in the world. Charleton Heston comes across as a pitiful person who seems to lack basic common knowledge.
The material is engaging and real. I can't understand why this would get an R rating except to keep teenagers from seeing something worthwhile.",1061337600,,718,4.89344262295082
1838387,5,B00008DDVU,"""...we have a lot more mixing of ethnicity in this country..."" What?!?! So, apparently Charleton Heston is a bigot as well as a gun fanatic. I loved watching Moore completely undress Heston during the final interview, not only was it a triumphant moment in cinema but a slap in the face to all of the rednecked, gun-toting maniacs in this country. Bowling for Columbine is the shot in the arm that this country needed to start a sensible plan for gun control. The statistics Moore cites are staggering and eye-opening. Aside from bitter disdain for the NRA, Moore (a lifetime member), takes a look at the gun issue from almost every perspective. The most powerful being the victims of the Columbine shooting. Moore also interviews such celebs as Matt Stone, Dick Clark (what a cold-hearted man) and Marilyn Manson. The path to Heston becomes all the more logical as the film progresses and the ultimate payoff is more than satisfying. Also, the insensitivity of the NRA is incredible. Just a few days after the Columbine massacre the NRA had the gall to stage a pro-gun rally in Littleton. This was no mistake...these people are sick and our Government needs to stand up and take notice. The stuff about Lockhead Martin is really scary as well, but all of these pieces fit perfectly into the puzzle of greed, manipulation and intimidation that this country is making famous. After seeing this film, I was truly ashamed to be an American. Powerful stuff...Highest Recommendation.",1061337600,,1478,4.892430278884462
1838388,5,B00008DDVU,"Let me start off by saying that BFC is not a Documentary, its one man's opinion about gun violence in America. Moore uses numerous events like Ruby Ridge and Columbine to ask ""are we nuts for guns or are we gun nuts"". Moore interviews many people who all quote the second amendment (The right to bear arms), Here's a little secret, The reason that amendment was put up so we could build up a effecient militia quickly. Does it honestly apply today? I'm in no fear of my life. There has been allegations saying that Lockheed Martin only makes sattelites, WRONG!. They make guidance systems for nuclear missles. I found out by going to their website. I'll believe that the Littleton Lockheed Martin plant doesn't make missles, but that doesn't make it any sunnier for them. If you look at this movie from different political sides, of course you're gonna react if you are conservative and enjoy it if you are liberal. All these reviews are coming from either gun pro or non pro, Moore is credible in this fact because he is neither. I give it a 5 because its a neutral political statement about one of our worst problems.",1061337600,34,1119,4.5721393034825875
1838389,5,B00008DDVU,"""Bowling For Columbine"" wonderfully explores the reality of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.  Michael Moore asks, ""what causes violence if it's not the guns?""  He proves that there is no certain answer.  His outspokenness and his deep information deserves the honor as the highest grossing documentary in movie history and the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.
Three celebrities: Charlton Heston, Dick Clark, and Marilyn Manson are featured.  Charlton Heston is the president of NRL (National Rifle Association).  Moore argues the appropriateness of Heston speaking in a pro-gun rally ten days after the Columbine school shooting and again ten days after a six-year old girl was shoot in a Michigan school by a peer classmate.  Dick Clark's short scene in the documentary expressed his inconsideration toward the slain girl.  Moore approaches his van asking for an interview.  Moore revealed that her mom is forced to work 70 hours per week in a welfare job sponsered by Clark.  Clark's reaction is shocking!  Marilyn Manson is the only featured celebrity who speaks brilliantly.  Manson reveals his reaction toward being blamed for inspiring Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to shoot 12 students and a teacher in their school.  He shares what actions he's take if he could meet the two troubled kids.
Moore asks ""are we safe in our houses?""  He travels to Canada and parts of the US interviewing random citizens about their beliefs.  They answer what often happens to those who don't lock their doors.  However, the opposite is expressed while he asks, ""why are we always scared?""  An LAPD shockingly reveals why no one is arrested for creating pollution, which is more dangerous than guns.  An illustrated scene gives an informative brief history of American fear.
""Bowling For Columbine"" is an eye opening experience.  It's recommended that everybody watches this at least twice.  It will inspire Americans to act upon their beliefs as did Michael Moore.  One never knows their capabities until they work.  Parents should present this documentary to their kids as it will enlighten their future.  However, there are some violent images presenting actual gun murders.  Those who are disturbed by this should fast forward those scenes.  ""Bowling For Columbine"" will stand as an American history artifact in the near future.",1061337600,,2336,5.168
1838390,5,B00008DDVU,"Forget about guns. This movie asks a simple question.
Why do so many Americans kill other Americans?
By any measure, this nation is #1 in violent crimes involving any kind of weapon: gun, knife, baseball bat.
Politicians and the NRA just want to throw more people in jail, but even with a larger percentage of our population in jail than any other industrialized nation, the violence continues.
Michael Moore asks why. Maybe in his next movie he'll come up with an answer.",1061337600,,472,4.7682926829268295
1838391,2,B00008DDVU,"Reviewing ""Bowling for Columbine"" is difficult from an objective standpoint, as almost all of the reviews here prove.  They range from praise that some would save for, say, the Dali Lama, to the kind of active hate I usually save for child killers.  The reason is not so much the ""documentary"", but the man who made it: Michael Moore.  Moore is a polarizing figure, he has his ardent followers and he has his angry detractors, and no one in the middle.  One liberal reviewer in the Washington DC City Paper called Moore the man ""who gives Liberal Muckraking a bad name""  So if the review sounds biased, I apologize in advance.
""Bowling for Columbine"" is a stunningly effective piece of propaganda.  Superbly entertaining, very very funny, and you leave the movie asking yourself some hard questions.  Unfortunately for Moore, some of those questions lead back to the truthfulness of his film.  Getting the gun from the bank-staged.  Footage of Charleton Heston saying ""From my Cold Dead Hand"" at an NRA meeting in Colorado after Coolumbine-actually much older footage of an event that took place on the East Coast.  Footage of the NRA meeting in Flint after a little girl was killed by a classmate-the meeting took place almost a year after it had happened.  Moore edits like crazy to make his targets look insensitive.  He's a master of staging events.
The most chilling part of the film is his interview with the ""third bomber"" from Oklahoma City.  Interesting yes, and yes, there are crazy types out there, but what did it have to do with anything?  Moore throws a lot of information at the viewer, possibly in a hope that no one will catch his most glaring errors.  However, thinking about a lot of the film in bits leaves you with the impression that it is much less than the sum of it's parts.  His bizzare questioning of the Lockheed/Martin spokesman in which he asks the man if he thinks that having a missle factory in the backyard caused Columbine.  Of course, that plant manufactures rockets that send satellites into space, but that doesn't matter to Moore.  He mentions the bombing of Kosovo as another possible motive for the attacks.  While this makes no sense, it feeds into Moore's thesis: that we are frightened nation of Gun Nuts.  The highly insulting cartoon(which, by the way folks, was NOT produced by the South Park Duo)equates owning a gun with hating African-Americans and supporting the KKK.  No real connection is made, but the fact that Moore says it exists is enough for his fans, who always said as much in private and are overjoyed that a narcissitic egomaniac who shares their views said it.
There are a couple of very good segments.  The first is when he talks with South Park co-creator Matt Stone, who makes some very valid points about the kind of verbal abuse many teens deal with in High School.  In fact, better documentaries have been made about that very subject.  Moore doesn't follow through, too content to blame the Government for everything.  The second point, which I actually heartily agree with, is that the media hypes violence.  Moore walks through South Central LA with a sociologist and they talk about how even though violent crime has been dropping in this country, the number of news stories covering murders has increased exponentially.  If it bleeds, it leads.  If the film were less sensationalistic, more thoughtful commentary like this would make it in, instead of wild claims that try to link the Vietnam War to Columbine.
In the end, the reason the film will probably be seen as a failure in the future is that it is all really about Moore.  He is a self-promoter in the finest tradition of PT Barnum(I mean that as a compliment)  From his self-serving endorsement of Ralph Nader in 2000 to his infamous Oscar speech and his plans to make a documantary blaming the entire Bush family for every crime ever committed against humanity, Moore is best at promoting himself.  Countless people in the film have since come out saying they felt used by Moore, from Lockheed Martin to one of the Columbine survivors Moore took to K-Mart to get than to stop selling ammo.  Moore will use any tragedy to advance his own cause-himself.  He is, in the end, a charlatan and elitist posing as an everyman.  His film cannot be judged without the correct view of the man who made it.  You can dislike Moore and agree with his views, but I've found very few who do.  Liberal or conservative.  Thoughtful conservatives(those who did the actual research that dispels much of his ""proof"" find Moore's trashing of them insulting, and thoughful, concerned liberals, while sypathetic to some of his causes, would rather have someone willing to debate with facts and reality than the strange, upside-down stuff Moore comes up with.  His film is not ""truth"" in any sense of the word.  If you think I'm insane, check out no-spin websites that are truly nonpartisan that have the same problem.  Check out LIBERAL sites that call him and his motives into question.  But in the end, do what Moore wants you to do with the rest of the world to him: look deeper, and see the rotten Underbelly and black heart at the heart of this ""fictitious"" documentary.",1061337600,7,5186,4.749720670391062
1838392,5,B00008DDVU,"I really liked this documentary. It tackles a very important subject, gun control, but also makes you think about the repercusion different policies have on society. Its sad, but also humorous at times. Controversial, it deals with a topic that many simply don't want to talk about.
However, it is impossible to deny that Michael Moore is totally in favor of gun control... That is certainly not a bad thing, but isn't it best when the director is impartial? He doesn't balance the pros and cons of gun control: he has already made his choice before starting this documentary, and that is fairly evident. Thus, it is difficult to say that ""Bowling for Columbine"" allows you to understand the subject at hand completely. Michael Moore is enthusiastic, fierce, witty,impetuous and zealous in the defense of what he thinks is right, but never neutral.
Nevertheless, he manages to get his point across quite well, and his ideas are valid. He makes us think and reflect, and that is the first step towards understanding an issue. If only for that, his documentary has my endorsement, and I give him 5 stars...",1061337600,2,1104,4.8465608465608465

It's a documentary of Michael Moore's search to understand why America has thousands more deaths caused by guns that any other industrialized nation. Moore cleverly debunks the myths one at a time... it isn't because the family is deteriorating, or because of Marilyn Manson, or even because of violent videogames and movies. And it isn't because of poverty and unemployment, or even our high levels ofgun ownership. Moore never really finds any answers, but the questions he raises about guns and violence in America are far more intriguing than any answer ever could be.
Some people may not want to buy this movie because of what Mike said at the Oscars. Some people may not like him because he is a rabble-rouser, or maybe his ""leftist agenda"" makes you uneasy. But to them I say, rent this movie at least, and watch it with an open mind. And if you do and can answer every question Moore raises with this film, what you need to do is run for President, because we need someone to take care of the mess America is in.

Secondly, instead of obsessing over every little factoid contained within this movie and how consistent or inconsistent it may be, LOOK AT THE MAIN MESSAGE OF THE FILM AS A WHOLE.
Mike does not say ""We shouldn't own guns"" -- he says ""We live in a lot of fear for no apparent reason."" WOW. Call the liberal police, even though he's basically stating the obvious. In fact, one of the main points Mike stressed in this film was that other countries who own the same percentage of guns as the U.S. don't have the same problems with violence that we do.
Some have criticized this movie for not answering the thesis Moore proposes at the beginning of the movie. However, the way I see it, we can thank Mike for not ham-handedly selecting a scapegoat for our problems with violence in the U.S.
But back to my original point, Mike's message is not a pro-gun control or anti-gun one, but rather an anti-fear movie. Why, then, is everyone so up in arms (pun fully intended) about it?

Not only are we pumped full of meaningless memes and jingles that hook us to some new brand name; but we are also being spoon fed heaping doses of fear! All this is a stunning realization from Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine. It's not that I didn't notice the fear thing before, but it's that Michael Moore put the truth right in front of my nose and made it so blatantly obvious.

What you get is a look at the problems with american society and the ignorance americans show towards the reasons for its decline.  It also looks at the impact the US has on the rest of the world, albeit a very one sided look.  It doesnt take much to work out which bits of the movie are unbalanced though.
Anyone giving this movie 1 star has to be either
a) american
B) gun nut
c) NRA member
d) charlton heston
e) all of the above

1838483,5,B00008DDVU,"Written, Produced and Directed by Michael Moore, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE fully deserves its Best Documentary Oscar. In fact, I'll admit that before I even watched this, I just presumed Moore was some pudgy idiot and wasn't expecting much given his ""Shame on you Mr Bush!"" comments. The spirit of Jane Fonda sadly isn't gone. I could just imagine Dubya sitting in front of the TV in the White House, watching the Oscars. After thinking a couple of minutes, he turns to the First Lady with a puzzled look and says ""Uh, Laura; honey. Was that chubby guy talkin' 'bout ME or 'bout DADDY? Maybe I'd better ring Mom.""
But of course it was stupid & naive of me to approach my review in this manner. I may be a self-proclaimed ""vidiot"", but I'm a person who actually SITS DOWN AND WATCHES movies before I review or moan about them.
BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is a doco everyone should watch. It's by turns biting, acerbically funny, disturbing, provocative, challenging & sobering.
Practically right off the bat, Moore goes into a bank with a hidden camera to open an account. As a token of their appreciation he is given a free gun! They may as well hang a sign in their window saying ""PLEASE ROB US!"". Ironically we later learn the fact that Moore won an NRA marksman award as a teen. Is this irony? Or hypocrisy?
Early on I remembered Charles Bronson's line in DEATH WISH 5: ""Guns have their uses. IDIOTS with guns make me nervous."" I felt that since the right to bear arms is in the U.S Constitution, no one should have the authority to impose their will upon others and violate those rights. Admittedly it's different in NZ, where gun laws are stricter: If an intruder broke into my house I would probably be forced to clock him on the head with my 2"" thick Leonard Maltin Movie Guide a few times and hope it works out in my favor.
But check this out. Interviewed here are:
1. A Guy with an ""Anarchist Cookbook"" on how to make bombs & napalm among other things. (I'm not THAT kind of anarchist!)
2. Another guy who sleeps with a loaded gun under his pillow. Constitutional right? Or just bloody daft?
3. Moore's visit to Lockhead Martin- the World's largest weapons manufacturer. One of their officials is interviewed standing in front of a nuclear warhead and saying he's not doing anything wrong. This guy even goes so far as to say that Columbine-style killings happen all around the World every day. That's totally f***ed up. I must be reading the wrong newspapers.
Other gems among BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE's many highlights is the finale where Moore goes one on one with Charlton Heston, who held a gun rally before the dust had settled on the Columbine Massacre, which makes his battle cry of ""From my cold dead hand!"" all the more disturbing.  Heston also admits to leaving loaded guns lying around his house where his grandkids can get at them. His feeble assertion is ""They know not to touch"". How did this guy win an Oscar? Heston winds up looking like a right plonker in the end.
Also interviewed are Marilyn Manson, who channelled his demons into music; & South Park co-creater Matt Stone, who worked his frustration at growing up in a small town into comedy; as opposed to them shooting up their schools. While we're on that subject, there's a frightening clip of a schoolkid  pulling A DOZEN guns he's had concealed in his baggy pants. Jeez!
Meanwhile, all the bible thumpers are blaming cartoons, Satan, toys, heavy metal, movies (!SPCS!) and Marilyn Manson (Who is actually a very intelligent guy. Maybe HE should run for President?). These clowns are just bad[].
There's also a funny animated sequence about the pilgrims & linking the NRA to the KKK, slavery and witch hunts.
While watching this I found within my personal views conflicting ideals. And yes, I'll openly admit a little hypocrisy. At least I can admit it. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is a movie that can be dissected and analysed and interpreted in countless different ways. So that's a good thing, right? And Chuck Heston should really be tipping his toupe to Moore. There's no denying the man has guts. An absolute must see.",1059177600,20,4090,4.655601659751038

Mr Moore raises some interesting points about the whole gun ownership issue and the many problems that seem to be a result of it. In accordance with the slogan ""guns don't kill people, men do"", Mr Moore sets out to find the real answers to the problem. Of course it is not possible to give a definative answer, but he makes a good effort. At the very least it gives you something to think about and gives you room to discuss it further with friends or family. This is one of the great things about this film.

1838500,5,B00008DDVU,"America a country without a true left or even a political centre has produced one of the great populists of modern times in Michael Moore. In this documentary he investigates the reasons behind the high incidence of gun deaths by young males. He focuses on two incidents, the killings at Columbine High School and another incident in which a young boy uses his fathers gun to murder.
Moore finds that the reasons for killing are not related to guns. Canada being a country which has a large rural sector has a huge rate of gun ownership but hardly any murders at all. What is the difference? The according to Moore is that Canada is a much more harmonious and peaceful society. He goes to a Canadian city and searches for the slum area but can only find well maintained comfortable public housing. He speaks to Canadians and finds that there is less fear, less conflict and less lunacy. America by contrast is not only a country with guns, it is a country in which people are scared and always on edge. The deaths and murders stem from this conflict which stems from America being a nation in which there is little investment in public infrastructure and there are huge pockets of poverty.
Moore however presents this message subtlety allowing it to come out of a series of interviews and stunts. He talks to the friends of the gunmen who were responsible for the murders at Columbine. He interviews a relative of Timothy McVeigh. Those interviewed are people who are seriously weird and the fact that they have open access to gun ownership is mind boggling. He travels to Canada speaks to law enforcement officers there about issues and looks at Canadian cities. He looks at the background of the tragic young boy and what the American welfare system required of the mother.
Yet for a film dealing with such a serious subject one cannot stop laughing at the brilliance in which Moore portrays the lunacy of some aspects of American society. His genius is that he can make some young gun victims look like (and they probably felt) heroes in confronting the store who sold the ammuntion which destroyed their bodies and making them withdraw it from sale. He can also turn a very old and pathetic Charlton Heston into an embodiment of evil indifference.
They used to say that the Truimph of the Will was the greatest propoganda films of all time. This is ahead of that by a country mile.",1058486400,10,2385,4.654028436018957
1838501,5,B00008DDVU,"When I had heard that Michael Moore's new film, Bowling for Columbine, had been selected for Cannes in 2002, I knew that he had a winner on his hands. It would be six months later that I would find out that I was wrong. That he didn't have a winner, but THE MOST IMPORTANT FILM OF HIS CAREER. Bowling For Columbine takes the controversy of gun control (that he wisely chose to keep it an open arguement) and makes his audiance realize that his arguement is primarily about fear. Guns are scary because guns cause fear. If they didn't, then a lot of people would not be dead, including those unfortunate souls in Columbine High School. Taking his arguement against fear, he does what any good debater would do, he elaborates it to include not just guns, but racism, greed, and good ole American bull(dung). The end of this movie is probably the most satisfying, as Michael Moore pays a visit to Charleton Heston and without raising his voice or going into a ""liberal tyraid"", he brings the egotistical and unforgivably cruel actor-turned-NRA President down to his knees in the most sad performance by any actor (Heston, I mean, not Moore) Even before we get there though, Moore had already punctuated his points in the movie, leaving us feeling ahead of the game. By no means should Moore's work be considered entirely reliable, like blaming Dick Clark for the death of a little girl, but an argument meant to stir people to think about things, to think about how they live their lives and how they leave thier impressions on others that might be the next ticking time bomb. As for the controversy that came with his now infamous Acadamy Acceptance speech, I can only say one thing; ""God Bless America"".",1058313600,2,1702,4.657807308970099
1838502,4,B00008DDVU,"Let me start with saying that Michael Moore did one heck of a job when he shot this documentary....and got away with it. Not only did he get away, he got an Oscar as well. The documentary has its fair share of insights, the best in my opinion has to be the South Park interlude explaning America's identity. Truly apt.
What held me back in giving this documentary a top grade has to do with some of Moore's actions which I can only label as typical American over-dramatization. The scene that readily comes to mind is when Moore places the photograph of the 6 year old victim of a gun related accident on Heston's front lawn. I mean, I'm sure Heston rubs me (and others no doubt) the wrong way and the racial remark he uttered was ghastly but even Heston didn't want a six year old to die as a result of a gun related accident. I'm sure he's as appalled as the next person about what happened. The way Moore leaves Heston's residence after placing the picture, bowing his head in quiet desperation, made me question his implementation of what I call a ""Oscar trick card."" But chances are Moore never looked at it this way and didn't realize he needlessly inflicted more harm to Heston that Heston did to himself. Moore should have let the interview with Heston speak for itself without driving home the message over the corpse of a six year old.
A bigger problem with ""Bowling"" I have has to do with the fact that Moore never really addresses the cause of the disproportionally large counts of gun related accidents in the US. Although he shows us what it isn't, he should have persisted more in finding out what is. He knows the answer is there but ultimately only manages to hint at it. In a later interview he is much more focused on this point but still doesn't seem to recognise that he hasn't answered the question or fails to see that this question is paramount and deserves the answer he has set out to find.
One of my favorite moments is the Marilyn Manson interview. Manson is being bombed by ""respectable"" Americans throughout this section, but he turns out to be the only person saying sensible things and arguing coherently and intellectually.
A good documentary, no doubt, but rewarding it with an Oscar made me wonder about the quality of all the other nominations. In any event you should at least rent it and then decide if you want to make it part of your collection.",1058313600,3,2385,4.497695852534562
1838503,5,B00008DDVU,"First of all, Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" is not only about what happened in Littleton, Colorado, over 4 years ago. This controversial documentary only uses that event as an example of a notoriously unique aspect of the United States way of life: the huge number of firearms among common citizens, and the final results when you live in a society where media vehicles, to make money and get audience rates, insists in installing an overpowering fear through the population. Moore's intention with this award winning movie is to understand why this happens.
As a documentary written, directed and starred by a single person, of course it's subjective. Michael Moore tends to manipulate numbers and some facts to achieve his final goals. What is most interesting in "" Bowling for Columbine"" is the series of interviews with interesting people such as Marilyn Manson, Troy Parker and Charlton Heston, among others, and their opinions about the population having this huge amount of firearms close at hand.
So, watching  ""Bowling for Columbine"" is only Phase 1 of something everybody should know and care about. Phase 2 is to get more information about all the subjects and situations portrayed in the movie, and to decide how right (or how wrong) Moore is, and what should be done about the problem. Because, whatever the reasons, causes, etc., there surely is a problem. Moore only made it more explicit.

1838526,4,B00008DDVU,"There is no such thing as an unbiased documentary; indeed the less biased a documentary appears, then the more suspicious I am of it. Michael Moore can be insensitive, even cruel, as he most certainly is to Charlton Heston in this film, but I never doubt where he stands. I didn't get the impression that Heston ""caused"" Columbine, rather that Michael Moore, an NRA member, was chastising Heston for HIS insensitivity in holding NRA rallies in towns still affected by school massacres.
You make a very important point in your review: ""The question should not be how did they get the guns, but why did they use them?"" and indeed the story of ""Bowling for Columnbine"" essentially concerns Michael Moore's attempt to answer that question. He ultimately comes to the conclusion that it is NOT the easy availability of guns that drove these kids to mass murder, but the harsh, competitive, alienating nature of American life. Columbine High School is described by one of its graduates (Trey Parker) as a living nightmare of degredation, threats malaise. A little boy would not have killed a little girl, he reveals, if his mother had been there to monitor him, instead of having to work two jobs and take an hours-ling bus ride to and from work. Moore also makes great play of the fact that Columbine manufactures the missiles with which America bombs civilians in other countries without warning.
The film's principle flaw, and what has opened it to its detractors, is that Moore's centrepiece ""stunts"" (the Kmart protest, the Heston interview) appear to advocate gun control, when ""Bowling for Columbine"" isn't really about gun control at all, but an examination of the collective psychology of America.",1057881600,20,1700,4.968421052631579
1838527,1,B00008DDVU,"***Just as a sidenote before I begin:
I recently looked at Moore's new book, ""Dude, Where's My Country?"", where the reader is treated to another childish dissertation from this simpleton.
In the book, Moore goes into utterly boring and repetative soapbox-class speeches about how the people of this Country are being exploited and used by the 'Rich Robber-Barrons' and Politicians, so I was just wondering, Mike...
After exploiting this tragedy of Columbine, how much of the profits from this film did you share with the victims of this shooting spree?
This film is making fun at a very serious subject. The logic presented to the viewer in this film is about as insightful as a fortune cookie from your local Chinese take-out resturaunt.
Moore seems more concerned about the gun lobby than examining the question of why these teens decided to turn their high school into a live-action video game. The question should not be how did they get the guns, but WHY did they use them? Why did they find human life so cheap? No answers here!
The filmaker seems more concerned with own his political agenda than a legitimate search for the truth. The only thing I got from this film is Moore's opinion that Charleton Heston and Martin-Merietta were responsible for Columbine. It's all done with editing, and this man goes to town! There's no kind of sensitivity whatsoever to this film; it's more like watching a comedy.
I have lost all faith in the Academy of Motion Pictures for trying to give this unsubstantiated clap-trap any shred of legitimacy. People, just because the camera moves around a lot and goes to everyday places, doesn't make it the truth. It also doesn't make it a documentary!

The per capita violent crime rate in all of those countries is far, far lower than America's. France alone would need another 1100 murders every year just to catch up with America on the per capita murder rate. Japan would need another 37,000 rapes just to keep up with our per capita rape rate. Germans would have to commit over 124,000 additional serious assaults on each other every year. No, we're not a violent society, at all. Germany and France are fairly equitable with us on theft, overall, but Mr. Moore wasn't investigating theft. He was investigating why we like to hurt each other, especially with guns.

1838530,5,B00008DDVU,"In this work of genius, Moore perpetuates myths of gun control by staging phony scenes, distorting fact, splicing together video to alter meaning and context, and basically panders to the mindless sheep who cannot deal with real-world facts. These are not the accusations of gun nuts, but are provable realities (see site mentioned below).
Since real documentaries are based on actual facts, sites such as revoketheosscar are not only detailing his many deliberate misrepresentations here, but are also calling for Moore's award to be recalled.
Is Moore's point of view right? It's of course possible that gun owners are indeed the spawn of Satan, as the Left believes, but having to resort to portraying fiction as fact - such as his staged bank account gun acquisition and WalMart ammo purchase - seriously weakens his credibility. Not to mention the credibility of the clueless critics who applaud this film.
One of the more disturbing trends of this age is the sentiment, ""Sure, he may be lying, but his heart's in the right place."" Come on, people. Wake up. Hard to believe, but this very sentiment was expressed by William Raspberry of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" - sure, he's playing fast and loose with the facts, but his ATTITUDE is right - ""Bush is the devil.""

He puts much of the blame on the news media for brainwashing people into a right wing mentality of violence fear materialism and heartlessness. He also blames the national rifle association for its outrageous insensitivity in the wake of the columbine massacre. I do mean it partly as a joke when i say that micheal  moore should move to Canada. But while i do think that micheal moore's depiction of dysfucntional aspects of american society are on target, too often mr moore himself comes across as angry and individualistic, traits that he criticzes as being part of american tradition.

And fictional is the word to bear in mind while Moore spins a web of half-truths, quarter-truths, and outright misinformation.  Interviews are ""creatively edited"" within an inch of their lives (including Moore's attempts to paint NRA chief Charlton Heston as a racist and the NRA as an ""extension"" of the KKK), and Moore's misstatements of fact range from his description of a Lockheed-Martin plant as a source of weapons of mass destruction (when in fact the plant exclusively produces rockets used to put satellites in space), to his faked purchase of ammunitions in Canada, to his complete fabrication of international gun fatality statistics.

1838551,5,B00008DDVU,"This is not another dull, dry discussion regarding the issue of guns and gun ownership in America.  Moore has an axe to grind (or ammunition to load?) and he does it with a style all his own.  If you treasure the cliche of ""if guns are made illegal, then only criminals will have guns"" then you might as lessen your likelihood of suffering a stroke and buy a ticket to the next Charlton Heston Film Festival.  But if it you seek a different viewpoint, one presented with wry and cynical humor, invest in this movie.  You won't be disappointed.
Who ever thought that the far-right militias could provide such humor?  And how about the bank that doubles as a - fully licensed - gun distributor?  Michael Moore will never be accused of being too subtle, but he does provide a great amount of entertainment while expounding on his admittedly liberal bias.  When this film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, he unabashedly used his 30 seconds of air time to propagate those views even further.
The title of Bowling for Columbine refers to the two teenage killers who allegedly went bowling on the morning of their massacre at the Colorado high school.  Moore has been criticized by some for his use of video from a security camera at Columbine on that day, however I think that these images are presented with respect and in the proper context.
Yes he does attempt a few ambush interviews, with mixed results.  Dick Clark basically drives away, K-Mart's public relations people provide a surprise and Charlton Heston manages to salvage some dignity while surrendering no ground whatsoever.  Other highlights include an examination of the different attitudes regarding guns as held by Americans and Canadians, the aforementioned bank with it's guns-as-giveaways promotion, and the Miss Militia calendar.
Moore uses statistics that sometimes beg for more explanation and source accreditation, but then again few people or organizations with positions on gun ownership and legislation do.  Where Michael excels is in the areas of providing entertainment and raising questions.

The film/documentary basically puts forward the question - are Americans nuts about guns, or just plain nuts? Moore's film would point to the latter, and it's not without its reasons. America has by far the highest toll of gun deaths for a Western country per year, 11,000+ as the documentary explains compared to the few hundred by the next highest ranking country. The average viewer would quickly come to the conclusion that it is because America has so many guns, but this view is challenged when Moore points out that Canada has seven million guns in ten million families, but ""only"" a few hundred deaths each year.
'Bowling for Columbine' focuses on the 1999 Columbine school shootings and the death of a six year old girl to form the basis of the documentary's questions. He also takes a look at the culture of fear that has been created by the American media and its victimisation of African Americans. Two of the documentary's highlights are the acts of America's foreign policy, played ironically to Satchmo's 'What a Wonderful World', and a cartoon explaining the brief history of the USA, which while simplistic, is certainly funny. And not to be forgotten, of course, is the interview with Charlton Heston. Moore lays into him like a ton of bricks and ends up making Heston look like what he is - a gun toting, far right fanatic with no moral basis for his beliefs. Well done Moore for exposing this!
One slight drawback of the documentary I felt, was how Moore seemed to present America as a land where guns rule and killings occur throughout it, but having been to America and having many friends who are American, I know for a fact this is not true. It obviously varies from place to place, which Moore didn't seem to explain.
As many critics have claimed, the low point of the documentary is Moore's failure to come up with an answer to his question. This is true, but I think the words of a review I recently read in the newspaper sums it up well - ""While Moore may not provide any conclusive answers to the questions he poses, in a world where people are too afraid to question anything, at least he's asking them"".
As the for the question Moore posed, that being why America has so many gun deaths compared to other western countries, I have come up with a view, which may or may not be correct. Ever since the Pilgrims arrived in America in the sixteenth century, Americans have constantly moved west to find new land. Because of this, they moved so quickly that often they had no governing body to restrict their actions, so people took matters into their own hands. Could these periods of lawlessness have created such a society?",1053907200,18,2943,4.661538461538462
1838576,5,B00008DDVU,"This is the fascinating story of two men from Michigan, both of whom began as hunters, and both of whom became members of the National Rifle Association.  From that point, however, their paths sharply diverged and this fascinating Academy Award-winning documentary delineates the divergent paths, leading to a dramatic meeting at the film's culmination.
Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore began as an avid hunter from Michigan who joined the NRA, the same organization of which the Oscar-winning film actor Charlton Heston became president.  Moore at the film's beginning shows a determined Heston stating his solid conviction concerning the possession of guns with the words, ""from these cold dead hands.""  Moore jumps straight into the controversy in showing Heston presiding over an NRA convention the same weekend as the Columbine Disaster in Colorado, despite strong opposition from Denver's mayor and large numbers of citizens from the affected community, including parents of victims.
Moore later tackles another controversy in his home town of Flint, Michigan, when Heston and the NRA met despite strong local opposition following the death of a young local child at the hands of a young boy who brought a gun to class.  Once more, the NRA and Heston went through with their plans.  An analysis of the tragedy resulted in Moore presenting some tragic but fascinating facts concerning situations which should be rectified.  The young boy's African American mother was compelled to make ends meet to catch a bus at the crack of dawn and work two jobs in another town.  One of them was at a yuppie desert parlor owned by Dick Clark, for which he received tax benefits for hiring employees who were previously on the welfare rolls.  The necessity of working two jobs in an effort to make ends meet resulted in the mother getting home late and being unable to properly supervise her child.  Moore sought to discuss the situation, who was plainly not interested and asked his driver to drive off.
The fascinating film concludes with Moore receiving an interview opportunity at Heston's Coldwater Canyon mansion.  The confrontation was indeed a memorable one.
This film once more solidified Moore's reputation as a daring and humanitarian filmmaker.  He is a true patriot who looks after the interests of those without the financial clout to hire lobbyists and influence presidents, governors and legislators.",1053734400,383,2411,5.204134366925064

Despite a very transparent campaign to discredit the integrity of the movie, this film still holds up as a very honest and sincere exploration of first the problem of rising gun deaths and then the culture of fear in america. The film's engaging, certainly entertaining and informative. But hopefully people don't stop at the movie. In my case the movie gave me a lot of food for thought, was the cause of much pondering and debate and it really affected me. As far as the accusations of the movie, this just shows how groundbreaking and challenging this movie is. If not for the accusations of the director being biased, falsifying information and staging certain scenes in the movie I probably would have never researched things for myself and found out how strong this movie is. As for being biased, this movie isn't any more biased than the network news channels, white house, politicians from all parties, other documenatarians out there. If anything this director's biased towards integrity, self accountabality and speaking for the little guy/gal (the average american). Still, whether you think this movie's a brilliant expose on the nature of guns and fear in america or a sorry train wreck, you still won't be able to keep your eyes off it once you get in the theaters. Any movie that causes this much of a reaction in people can't be all bad. ....",1053388800,15,1386,4.852320675105485
1838583,5,B00008DDVU,"Having seen this at the cinema twice, and being a proud owner of my own copy on DVD (I live in the UK, it's been out here for a few weeks) I can understand why this documentary won it's award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002.
The focus is primarily about gun ownership, fear culture, and some history of gun laws, in the USA. Columbine High School is used as one of the illustrative examples of how and why the current legislation is not a good thing.
Some coverage is provided about the culture surrounding gun ownership, and the culture of fear that seems prevelant in american media over recent years. As a regular viewer of american news services (thank-you digital tv :-), I can attest to the accuracy of this coverage in comparison to that provided in europe. Michael Moore provides his own comparison - to media coverage of events in Canada. Also, some interesting insights from Marilyn Manson (who rose considerably in my estimation), which seemed especially relevant as we sat on the cusp of Gulf War 2.
Something which was clear to me from Moore's attempts to speak to someone senior in K-Mart, was that without making a fuss, and turning up without an attending media circus, no-one seemed particularly interested in listening to him and the students he was with. It seemed that only when revenue was potentially affected by bad press, was anyone prepared to take any form of action at all.
The closing interview with Charlton Heston, and indeed some of his actions as president of the NRA, leaves one wondering how people of this ilk can sleep at night. Perhaps it's the loaded weapon under the pillow that does it for them, which I find as disturbing as some of the other images presented liberally throughout the documentary.
I speculate that there are those in the USA who will not take well to this. However, I felt that the documentary was well thought through, and presented a good case for attempting to remove guns from the population at large. It may also help a few people consider how some of us in europe view the USA.
There's a lot more I could say about this, but you really are better seeing this for yourself. There's plenty in there to make you laugh, but there's even more that you'll watch from behind your hands in disbelief. You can be laughing one minute, and very misty eyed the next. You absolutely, positively must see this.
As a minor aside - interesting to see Disney preventing Miramax from releasing his new movie this month (May 04). So much for  freedom of speech.",1053388800,9,2510,4.615212527964206
1838606,3,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore raises important questions about violence in America, and offers some provocative answers.  Unfortunately, he is so clearly biased by his own political views, that his conclusions lack credibility, and ultimately the film degenerates into a political manifesto.  The clearest indication of this is that those who share Moore's political views love the film, while those who don't hate it.
At first, the film seems to be an intelligent investigation into the question of why gun violence is so widespread in the U.S.  Using the tragedy of Columbine as a focal point, Moore explores the factors that might explain why, for example, the number of gun deaths is over 11,000 per year in the U.S., while being less than 100 in most other industrial nations.  This is a striking statistic, and the viewer will be eager to learn more.
But this is no Frontline investigation.  The statistics and historical accounts are distorted, the interviews are staged to make some people look good and others look bad, and anecdotes are presented as generalized facts.  In short, it soon becomes apparent that the filmmaker is far from objective and probably had his mind made up about the topic before starting the film.
There is nothing wrong with making a film with a point of view.  But then don't try to pass it off as a documentary.  It's the blurring of the line between objective reporting and proselytizing that makes this film so insidious.
Moore has a way of interviewing those he doesn't like or agree with that is obviously staged to make them look bad, and he uses this technique shamelessly.  He peppers Charlton Heston and Dick Clark with questions that are really rude accusations, and then makes a big deal of the fact that they terminate the interview, as if somehow this is evidence of their guilt, rather than his rudeness.  He gets away with it because it is entertaining to watch.  At the same time,  Moore practically coddles Marilyn Manson and others that support his point of view and can be seen effusively agreeing with them on camera.
Bottom line: this is a film about an important topic that will make you think, and is worth seeing, as long as you keep in mind that it is not a documentary, but rather an opinion piece staged as a documentary.",1053043200,15,2268,4.787179487179487
1838607,5,B00008DDVU,"I'll be honest. I heard of 'Bowling for Columbine' before the Oscars, but never paid much notion. Until I heard Moore's Oscar speech on the radio. I was amazed that anyone would dare to speak out so sharply against the Bush administration on such an event.
Sadly, though, the movie was unavailable to me for a long time... Amazon's English counterpart DOES have it for sale. (Region 2).
The movie is built around the shootout at the Columbine high school, where two teenagers opened fire on their fellow students. Moore wonders what possessed these two, and makes it his mission to find out why the US shows such a ridiculously high number of murders when compared to other nations such as Canada, the UK, Germany, etc.
He interviews various people, ranging from NRA's chief spokes goblin Charlton Heston, relatives of the kids who got killed, victims of the Columbine shootout, and bad-boy rocker Marilyn Manson (Who is named as one source of violence in kids).
As the documentary proceeds, Moore weeds out a few of the often-named arguments of why anyone would go postal. Violent movies are also watched in other countries, Marilyn Manson is also listened to in other countries, Canadians own more guns-per-capita than the US, and not just the US has a violent history.
The underlying conclusion as the movie proceeds seems to be that Americans are kept in control by fear; time after time, the US Government uses the media to strike fear into it's subject's hearts. This (according to the movie) leads to the 'Shoot first, ask questions later' mentality that could in turn explain why the number of killings in the US is as high as it is.
A very striking moment (in my opinion) is when Moore takes two victims to K-mart's HQ, and kindly asks them to stop selling ammo for handguns. Initially, they seem to have hit a brick wall, but when they return the day after (with more press in their tracks than Michael Jackson usually gets), a statement is made that K-mart indeed will stop selling said ammo.
Moore raises some very valid points, often combined with a great touch of humour, and we can only hope that enough people will go and watch this movie. If Moore succeeds in just making ONE person reconsider taking up their gun and using it to cause death and mayhem, THAT'S when the movie REALLY proved successful.",1052956800,10,2318,4.725925925925926

1838609,1,B00008DDVU,"Muddled and spurious. Most irritating moment is the flash card run through of America's alleged misdemeanours abroad which were supposed to be accepted on some subliminal level rather than thought about.
If you pose the question as to why there is such a high level of gun crime in the States then it might be worth your while looking at the convictions and drawing some conclusion as to the motivations behind them. At one point we are shown a quick collage of video recorded shootings for the purpose of illustrating the point that Americans kill each other rather than examining why. It's curious that Moore should lambast American imperialism while showing indifference to a foreign audience who may not be familiar with the background story behind the clips. Doesn't he care that we might like to know or does he think it's irrelevant because he merely wanted to point out that guns discharge bullets? I do recognise the clips, which have been aired in the UK in various documentaries. One was the highway guy who I think was shot by a police marksman. Less familiar was the man trying to shoot a women as she lay screaming on some grass and it was distressing to have been subjected to this while being kept in the dark about why this was happening. The footage of a man in police custody being shot in the head I recall as occuring at a courthouse where the man was about to go on trial for raping the assailant's child. The motivation of this crime would appear to be revenge then, rather than the catch-all 'fear' that Moore seemed to be pushing without question. What else would examining gun crime convictions reveal, if he had bothered? How many gun murders occur during robberies, for instance? The motivation could be unwillingness to work for a living, rather than fear. Moore questionably states that the poverty issue is the preserve of the left but wouldn't it be worthwhile talking to the criminals who actually commit crimes rather than scoring political points? Of course, prisons are full of innocent men, but some are honest about discussing their failings. Knocking on Canadian doors is less illuminating and statistically meaningless, too.
I'm also minded of how television stations in Britain often cancel films that may offend those who have been the recent victims of an air disaster or child abduction, only to show them two weeks later. Likewise with the Heston interview. Is it any more morally acceptable for Heston to cancel his visits to Flint and others mentioned only to arrive at a later date when the victim's families may be less bereaved? Moore ducks this question. Why should Moore expect Heston to be held to account for the death of the little girl when Moore himself is a NRA member? Just because he wouldn't have been crass enough to show up at the meeting?
One of the reasons often put forward in favour of having a gun in every home in the States is to prevent a totalitarian government from oppressing the people after a coup. The film doesn't examine this interesting point. After all, it beggers the question as to how, if a totalitarian administration would be unable to impose it's will on an armed American people, can a democratically elected government enforce the legitimate laws of the land now? Certainly there seems to be this very problem already with some of the Militias portrayed in the film. A better documentary still awaits on this subject matter.",1052697600,32,3413,4.786440677966102
1838610,5,B00008DDVU,"This is the first documentary that I have ever seen and I was blown away. The movie had so much reality to it, it had so much humor, it had so much.....seriousness to it. It had everything a big Hollywood movie has except more real.
After director/writer/producer Micheal Moore was blasted at the Oscars for his verbal attacks on America I just knew that I had to see his film on the topic of gun control. When I finally saw it when it was on it's last breath in Manhattan I was really glad that I payed ten dollars to see it.
It starts off with Micheal Moore going into a bank. The bank says that if you open a special account you get a free gun. It then rolls off to people opionions about owning guns, using guns for protection, and the 2nd amendement which enables every man to bear arms. We are even treated to a five minute cartoon about American History.
The film had all different kinds of angles. There was Micheal Moore private filming. There were special news reels and footage. What had me interested the most was how when they were talking about the Columbine shootings they showed the actual tapes that the school had. We saw the kids being forced to go under the tables, we saw the two kids responsible for the shootings looking around and mabey even communcating with one another. I was wondering throughout the movie why anybody would want to do that. Who wound get angry enough to kill people who are of a different race, religion, and ethics just because they are different. It was a movie that I was thinking about even after I left the theatre.
We were provided with interviews with people who lived in the area, people in other countries, and celebrites like NRA president and actor Charlten Heston, singing Marilyn Manson, and South Park co-creator Matt Stone who went to Columbine School. We saw the large comparisions between the murders and deaths from guns to our country to the amount of others. In Canada there are 65 people who are killed by guns a year. In America 11,127 people are killed by guns per year. In Cananda, people go to bed with doors unlocked. Moore even opened various doors of houses in Cananda to prove this.
I am just naming a few things that this movie does. Thid movie talks about various other shooting including the death of a six year old girl who was killed by a six year old boy who found a gun in his uncles house and took it. This movie has terrible topics, but it's all true.",1052524800,38,2434,4.435267857142857
1838611,1,B00008DDVU,"I agree with some of the other reviewers.
I've heard many accusations against this film, and I don't want to hear them anymore. I don't want to hear about...
-- How the missiles referred to in the film were for `commercial' use not military.  It's the same thing.  A missile is a missile and all missiles are bad missiles, and Moore would agree with me.
-- How the Heston speech was spliced together from two different speeches, making him look like he's saying something different.  Hey, he said those words.  Context doesn't matter, and Moore would agree with me.
-- How the bank sequence is staged.  That doesn't matter.  It's not like this is a documentary, and Moore would agree with me.
-- How the statistics about China's gun record are stellar because China is communist.  Of course, that's why they call it a `police state'.  And Moore would agree with me.
-- Canada isn't really that good of a place to live.  Yeah, but hockey is still a really cool sport.... Even if Moore doesn't agree.
-- France is socialist.  Duh, just like Moore is.
I've heard it all before. I don't care. This was an entertaining movie. I don't go to the movies to learn 'facts' I go to be entertained, and that's what this movie does. Don't confuse me with 'truth' vs. 'error'. Life's too short for all that.

Michael Moore rewrites history and edits and splices audio and text freely to portray people as saying things that they never said.  He staged scenes and presented them as candid shots.  In his attempt to denigrate America he lies about everything from the year that the KKK was founded to the text on a B-52 memorial at the Air Force Academy to the sattelite launch vehicles built in Littleton.  It is very telling that he can not make his case based on facts, and is forced to resort to fiction while claiming it to be a documentary.

1838614,4,B00008DDVU,"I've just read a few reviews on the previous pages and I must say that some people really don't apply any thought or have any ability to extract a memory of a given film. However, I do agree with one thing that the naysayers are saying... BFC is not a documentary and never should have been entered into this catagory. It is wholly a single-sided perspective that pointedly asks the question ""Why is it that America has the highest gun-related deaths on earth?"" A interesting question and it is facinating to see Moore struggle to attain any sort of coherent answer to such a morbid inquiry. A lot of his ""murder by numbers"" are suspect (where did he get those death-toll numbers?). However, his ""gun owned ratio"" is quite exact with Canada having more guns per person than America and yet the number of deaths related to that ownership percentage is far exceeded in America (and you don't need to be a statistician to figure that one out - an averaging of newpaper headlines between both national boarders is revealing enough even for the most simple-minded).
The way that Moore trudges on bravely to find his answer is most of the entertainment found within this film, and his conclusion that FEAR is the driving motivation behind the excessive gun-related death is an interesting hypothesis that perhaps bears further investigation (and I suspect that that simple explaination is either letter perfect or not far off the mark).
This was an entertaining film that threw out apparently random statistics in order to pigeon-hole and stereotype militia (although they are a laughable and often simple people) and villify the aging Charlton by re-editing and splicing sound-bytes so that the common person will make unfounded and highly illogical connections between his speeches as the head of the NRA, the time that they took place, where they took place, and the content that they spoke to and of.
If nothing else, it's fun to see people mis-interpret the message that Moore is trying to say which is, at it's most simple... guns aren't bad, it's the society's perpetuation of misunderstanding, stereotyping, and ability to lay blame that creates these complex problems.

Unfortunately maybe it requires more time to delve more completely into this topic.  This isn't to say he doesn't do a marvelous job in the time he uses.  He brings up many points for debate, but he also leaves some hanging.  He spends a good amount of time delving into the perception of the ""dangerous black male"" only to sort of drop it part way through.
The Cartoon of American History was about the funniest and most accurate portrayal of American History I have ever seen.
His conversation with Charleston Heston seems the only possible way to end the movie.  You get a sense of Heston earlier in the movie and the conversation at the end only seems to confirm your suspicions about him.

1838658,5,B00008DDVU,"One of the reviewers on this site forgives Willie Horton of crimes against women in an effort to discredit Michael Moore. Of course there are going to be a handful of negative reviews when some people are so willing to bend over backwards to find a problem with Michael Moore.
There are, however, also some very, very good reviews, and I would encourage visitors of amazon.com to consider the agenda of those people who have attempted to drive down sales of this item through negative feedback. Rather than encouraging people to become informed from a variety of ideological sources, conservatives have made it their mission to stiffle liberal ideas. I would personally suggest that you watch this movie and also read something like Ann Coulter's ""Slander,"" and then make up your own mind, rather than having it made up for you by a lack of information.
Also, to say that this film is ""liberal"" in the common sense of the term is a misrepresentation. In most ways it is liberal, except that it is a film about the dangers of gun violence and it quite specifically DOES NOT SUPPORT GUN CONTROL. I think that Michael Moore likely started filming with every intention of making a movie about the wonders of gun control, but what he found in his investigation steered him away from this ideology. This is a sign of the open-mindedness with which Mr. Moore approaches a liberal agenda. I was impressed to see one of the staples of liberal-dom, gun control, thrown out upon further investigation. Mr. Moore recognized that other concerns had more impact on the issues that he was discussing.
As to the meat of the film, it would be inappropriate to ruin anything specifically. Michael Moore's presentation of the issues is so ingenious that to hint at his method of approach would do the film a disservice. What I can say is that there is an animated history lesson that should be shown in every school, an interview with Charlton Heston that should be shown to every closet racist, and a segment about Canada that should encourage Americans to travel even in the face of SARS.

1838659,5,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine is one of the greatest films of all time.
Thoughtful and provacative, it traces the tragedy that struck our entire nation.  It combines humor, wit, and boldness to ask the question of why such a tragic event as the Columbine shootings occurred.
I wish to respond to some of the reviews I read regarding this film, particularly the scathing and unartful ones, in defence of Moore's work.
First, the claim made by one reviewer stating that he/she ""couldn't put [his] finger on what Michael Moore's argument was after [he] was done watching"" brings to question whether it is a problem with Moore's argument or, more likely, if it has something to do with this reviewer's ability to follow the ideas that the film presents.  In no way does Moore claim authority over the issues at hand; rather, he presents a situation with facts that are otherwise unknown or glossed over by mainstream media.  His main intent is not to solve the ongoing problem of violence in America, but instead is to provide insight to the possible CAUSES that led up to the unnecessary violence involving these young Americans on such a large scale.
The beauty of this film is its activism through Moore's uncanny humor and trademark sarcasm.  The scene showing the 9-11 movie footage with Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" playing in the background is precisely Moore's style of ironic and thought-provoking presentation.  By combining these two drastically contrasting elements, Moore's intelligent audience is able to see the similarly contrasting aspects of the gilted ""American Dream"" versus what is real and wrong about the United States.
The fact that K-Mart sold bullets to the Columbine shooters is clearly an aspect that something is terribly wrong with society.  The same reviewer who couldn't follow Moore's ""argument"" wrote that ""the two Columbine victims confronting K-Mart headquarters felt as if it was all Moore's planning.  They just didn't seem like the type who would've gone on this thing on their own.""  Aside from the fact that this very offensive comment is an attack on the victims, it is obvious that these high school students would probably not have, in fact, confronted K-Mart.  Not only have they been drastically impaired physically (wheelchair, bullets in body), but these boys are clearly in no mental nor emotional state to dive into a conflict between a huge corporation like K-Mart alone.  This is where Moore comes in.  He is the facilitator of these young victims who would otherwise have voice in the issue.  Through his gift of film, he gives these boys a chance to challenge a monstrous corporation's business ethics, to aid in preventing another tragedy (the first of which should not have occurred in the first place), and to know that they are capable of making a difference.
Although there are many more comments reviewers have made that I feel are rash and unjustified, the one last statement that i will tackle is the one that states, ""I've read that in the last few years violent crime in the U.S. is down 20%, while media reporting of crime is up 600%.  This 'documentary' goes a long way to increase that kind of imbalance...""  Bowling for Columbine?  I question whether this particular comment is about the same film that I am defending.  Moore is clearly arguing the first half of this person's statement, which is obviously why he concludes that fear is one (perhaps the most prominent) of the underlying causes of violence in America, as the South Park clip comically illustrates.  As for the film increasing the imbalance, I think it does quite the opposite by comparing U.S. news, with its constant emphasis on street crimes and violence (not to mention the lack of awareness regarding white-collar crime) to Canadian news, with the example of its special report on new speedbumps.  Moore brings up issues of violence not to increase fear and anxiety as mass media such as the U.S. news often does, but to simply take these issues and seek ways in which we as Americans can work to solve them in creative, non-violent methods.
All in all, Bowling for Columbine is an honest film by a man who recognizes the injustices that individuals suffer from because of the many rotten holes in society where the rich (and the big bad corporations) can get away with virtually anything.  Through this and all of his other films, he criticizes capitalism and avidly fights for the rights of the individual.  He proves that one man can truly make a difference and that it can happen through means other than violence.",1051315200,23,4559,4.9037711313394015

Given that, however, there still is a lot of truth in there. The U.S. support of foreign dictators and U.S. installed governments is certainly something that nobody seems to want to address. It's also true that Moore's argument is discontinuous and never arrives at a true solution. But I give him a lot of credit for attempting to bring an enigma to the attention of Americans. Once again, the ""statistics"" of the number of gun deaths for various countries are misleading, but it does show that there are many many many more gun deaths in the States than there are in most industrialized countries. And although it doesn't provide a definite answer, it does ask the question of why things are like they way they are in America. In the end, I don't think this movie is about gun control anymore than it's actually about Columbine. It's about asking a tough question, and at least trying to find an answer.

1838663,4,B00008DDVU,"Full disclosure: I can't stand Michael Moore's politics; I am about as far removed from the Great Yawping Gadfly of the American Left as it is possible for a man to be.
That said, I enjoyed, got a few laughs, and was (in spots) actually moved by Bowling for Columbine, which aims higher than Moore's previous blockbuster documentary ""Roger and Me"", but ultimately, due to muddled ideas and sloppy execution, falls short. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though: ""Bowling"" is both more ambitious and ultimately more entertaining that ""Roger and Me.""
Let's get the basics out of the way: ""Bowling for Columbine"" is ostensibly Moore's quest to find out what motivated Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the self-described 'Trenchcoat Mafia' who murdered 13 of their fellow classmates (and a teacher) in Littleton, Colorado in April 1999. The title of the film refers to the pair's unusual pre-massacre activity: they went bowling.
I say ""Bowling"" is 'ostensibly' about the Columbine massacre because the film is only obliquely, and shallowly, concerned with the horrific events in Littleton.  The facts of the killing are dealt with briefly, and we never see pictures of Harris or Klebold; indeed, the security camera film that captured the massacre in the library (grainy, ominous, and horrible, with an instrumental version of Marilyn Manson's ""Nobodies"" in the background) is frustrating in that it is impossible to see either of the killers.  Of course, Moore is making a larger point in ""Bowling"": that the Columbine massacre was not simply a unique incident, but symptomatic of some underlying American disease. ""Bowling"", then, is Moore's attempt to address and discover the disease itself. Unfortunately, along the way, Moore's diagnosis is hijacked by two of the filmmaker's favorite bugaboos: gun control and the National Rifle Association (NRA).
Michael Moore is himself a strange and highly filmable character, a huge, rangy, lumbering man whose physical presence, particularly when paired with cowering corporate drones frantically parsing their comments, is screechingly funny. Moore has the true documentarian's gift for capturing the absurd on film, and his timing, for the most part, is impeccable. Indeed, when Moore is not preaching and simply lets the camera roll, the film is at its most hysterical. The encounter with the K-Mart PR flak is wonderful; so too is the interview with a Michigan state trooper, who waxes on a bit too much concerning an accident where a hunter is shot by the rifle he draped around his dog's neck---all to get a ""cute"" picture. A snippet of dialogue will suffice:
TROOPER: ""The picture would have been really cute.""
MOORE: ""But do you think the dog might have done it intentionally, had an idea of what it was doing?""
TROOPER: ""Oh, I can't say, sir. I don't know.""
Dialogue like this is in abundant supply, and how can you hate a man who badgers Dick Clarke (who escapes in a minivan)? Even better is Moore's interview with members of the Michigan militia: again, the brilliance in this sequence is that Moore's camera (and the idiotic comments made by the militia members) tells the story, without Moore having to say a thing. Slightly more uncomfortable is Moore's interview with James Nichols, who was indicted in the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing along with his more infamous brother and Tim McVeigh. To me, this was one of the most disturbing parts of the movie; Nichols is so manic that I actually felt concerned for Moore's safety. This sequence is actually quite compelling, leading me to conclude that perhaps with certain folks (Nichols, for instance), a little gun control might not be a bad thing.
""Bowling"" is not a bad film, but it is a muddled film. Moore wants desperately to bash the NRA, but by his own admission American gun ownership is not really the culprit behind the violence of American society. There are some issues where Moore's taste is questionable, of course: the heavily edited interview with Charleton Heston comes across as oafish, and the animated ""Brief History of the United States"" is deplorably racist.
But if anything, Moore hobbles his own movie by not addressing his own thesis: if gun ownership isn't the issue, then what is? What follows is Moore jumping from one causal link to another: violent video games, shock rock, Goth culture, drugs, sex, rock n' roll, and the focus-deprived American media, all linked by sequences where Moore bashes the NRA.
This is where the movie is most frustrating: Moore comes close, very close, to understanding Columbine, with two very keen interviews---and nonetheless misses the larger point. South Park producer/director/creator Matt Stone makes some very precise points about the nature of American high school culture, a time in wihch evolution seems in reverse, when those least fit to succeed in the larger culture terrorize those who are brightest, most ambitious, and most different.
By far the best interview in the piece is with Marilyn Manson, who suggests the best way of dealing with bullying and harrassment in high school is to grow up, to get through it, and to discover that life is dramatically different (and far more rewarding) after graduation. Matt Stone, Marilyn Manson, and Bill Gates, and even Michael Moore prove it: the geeks shall inherit the Earth.
Asked by Moore what he would tell Harris and Klebold if he could, Manson provides the film's best nuggest of wisdom: ""I would say nothing at all; I would listen. And that was exactly what wasn't done.""
A pity that Mr. Moore, for all his cinematic talents, didn't heed that advice. That said, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is well done, informative, provocative, and entertaining. And by the way, is it really that easy to get an interview with Heston?",1051228800,17,5757,5.046218487394958

The most eloquent part of the film, I think, is when K-Mart agrees to ban the sale of amunition in all their stores.  The looks on those two men's faces were uplifting and sad at the same time, because you know what price bought their victory.

1838707,5,B00008DDVU,"First off, I have actually seen this film. I enjoyed it but feel it lack the cohesive argue of his brilliant first film ""Roger and Me"" and the work he did on TV Nation.
But let's be honest. These reviews that sharply divide between excellent and poor are not about the film's content.  After the Oscars, Michael Moore has become demonized along with French wine as the symbol for ideas that threaten the union. Behind all that double speak, it's about the polarization of free speech attitudes.
After the 911 tragedy, the public unaware that its' security was an illusion all along hungered for voice in the woods.  Black and White. Good and Evil.  They wanted a clear worldview with out messy entanglements that would save them from the chaos. But there is a price all this Homeland security and it seems to require giving up freedoms like speach and rights to privacy. Not to mentioning allowing a right wing agenda to sweep through when normally it would be met with opposition.
The one thing you can't have is people questioning authority. Oh, they will say it's because we are not supporting our troops and endangering them. But if we are engaged in another war at the time of elections will debate of ideas be suspended. I think not. The real reason is for them to be secured everyone has to go along with the flow. They just can't risk an alternate view that might put them in perceived jeopardy. And yet the reasons for war remain unclear and world is still hopped up on worry.
I applaud the Mr. Moore for standing up and not allowing themselves to be bullied by those who want to use public opinion to stifle a dissenting view. In that light, I will add my 5 star review to out weigh those with an axe to grind.
It would seem their little plan has backfired though. The Dixie Chick concerts still sell out. Michael Moore's book is on the bestseller list and he has been approached about starting up TV Nation again.
As for me, I eagerly await the Bowling for Columbine DVD release that I might enjoy it in the privacy of my home drinking a nice French wine. Lord forbid, but in my drunken state and exposure to such leftist ideas, I might even question our leaders motives. Oh my!",1051056000,15,2189,4.494974874371859
1838708,2,B00008DDVU,"An otherwise excellent Academy Awards show was marred when the Academy gave an Oscar to Michael Moore for this political polemic about violence in America.  The attendees roundly booed Moore's acceptance remarks, and Steve Martin joked about putting Moore in the trunk of his limousine. After the Award ceremony we've seen David Horowitz on CNN refer to Michael as an ""ultra-left wing, anti-American Leninist.""  On Jay Leno we saw James Woods refer to Michael's acceptance remarks as ""Chicken(bleep)!""  So between those two and the Academy we have a pretty wide range of reactions to Michael and his movie!
He begins with Columbine and demonstrates that everyone looks at that tragedy and sees their favorite evils, whatever they are.  A series of commentators on TV enumerate their respective favorite enemies:  Satan; Bill Clinton; Marilyn Manson; violent video games; violence on television; violence in the news; violent gangsta rap; and on and on. It makes the point that the public reaction to the massacre was bewilderment, confusion, and BIG differences of opinion about what could cause such despicable brutality by a couple of seemingly typical teenagers. Michael makes the case that, since the last thing these boys did before they opened fire was to go bowling, why not blame bowling for the incident; hence, the name of this movie.
Moore conducts many of his patented self-promoting, sanctimonious interviews including James Nichols, unindicted co-conspirator in the Oklahoma City bombing and a member of the Michigan Militia (It's pretty funny); Marilyn Manson (It's pretty thoughtful, and a little touching); and Charlton Heston (It's so annoying, you wonder why Heston didn't pull out his long musket and order Michael off his property!  Probably would have, had he not been in the early stages of Alzheimer's, as we learned later.)
He finds some easy laughs in a bank in the Midwest that was offering a free rifle to anyone opening a new account.  He perhaps does some good by interviewing folks at Kmart about their sale of bullets.  I understand they took them off their shelves after Michael's interview.
One of the most objectionable scenes in the movie is footage of the second airplane flying into the World Trade Center to a recording of Louis Armstrong singing ""What a Wonderful World."" It's a mystery what argument is being made here, or what purpose is trying to be served.  For me it was horrifying and tasteless---perhaps more horrifying than when I saw it on live TV on 9/11!
Another low point is an ambush interview with Dick Clark, in which Michael is evidently blaming HIM for a tragic Michigan school shooting.  It struck me as utterly unfair and dishonest, and NO ONE will believe that accusation.
This film attacks so many subjects so broadly that it has all the subtlety of one of those ""anti-personnel"" missiles that explode 100 feet in the air and spew shrapnel all over an area the size of two football fields, killing everyone indiscriminately.  Military hypocrisy; media focus on violent crime; the gun industry; the NRA; the KKK; U.S. foreign policy inconsistencies; ALL the usual suspects. And nowhere is there any real insight into any of these ""problems,"" and certainly no solutions.
He mentions that on the day of the Columbine shootings the U.S. dropped more bombs on Kosovo than on any other single day.  So what are we to make of THAT coincidence?  Michael doesn't say, but seems to imply some ominous, undefined connection.
This movie shows us a lot of Michael's anger but very little insight.  Like his book ""Stupid White Men,"" it comes across as self-promotion masquerading as investigative, crusading journalism in this movie, and as political humor in the case of the book. There is more and better humor in the movie than the book, but a few chuckles do not redeem either work, for me.
The movie is at times thought provoking, at other times mindless.  Sometimes invigorating, at other times infuriating. Always confrontational, NEVER conciliatory. The hope of many media reviewers has been that the movie will stimulate more discussion of the causes for excessive violence in America.  If that was the goal I think it has failed.  Conservatives see the movie as despicable anti-American propaganda, while liberals see it as gospel (perhaps admitting to a little artistic overemphasis, at worst.)  So, I think the effect of the movie is DIVISIVE in the extreme. And that makes it a very bad movie in my book---notwithstanding the Academy Award for best documentary feature of 2001. I've read that in the last few years violent crime in the U.S. is DOWN 20%, while media reporting of crime is UP 600%.  This ""documentary"" goes a long way to INCREASE that kind of imbalance, and of course that's one of the things Michael skewers as a cause of the anxiety that underlies violence.
So--- is Michael a genius---or an ultra-liberal, anti-American Leninist?  You'll have to decide for yourself.  Some liberals have said that Michael Moore is the Rush Limbaugh of the left.  If so, maybe some enterprising, struggling conservative mediocrity will follow Al Francken's example and make his fame and fortune with a book called ""Michael Moore is a Big, Fat Idiot!""

1838711,5,B00008DDVU,"After the controversial acceptance speech at the Oscars, Michael Moore has been under a lot of heat and, well, it worked to his advantage. As I type this, his book, Stupid White Men is at #1, he is being offered TV spots for his TV Nation/Awful Truth show, and Moore himself is working on his next film, a look at the Bush/bin Laden business relationship.
Some people will say the movie is ""left-bias,"" but Moore himself was an NRA member and sharpshooter in High School. Some will say Moore never accomplishes his goal (finding out why america is so gun crazy), but the movie comes across more as food for thought. And in the process, he DID educate us about ""welfare to work"" programs and GOT K-MART TO STOP SELLING BULLETS! Did Chicago or My Big Fat Greek Wedding do that? Michael knows exactly how to keep an audience glued to their seats for two hours, and spend the time LECTURING! The ""awful truth"" is that documentaries are generally boring, but with segments like the animated ""history of america"" and ""corporate cops""  Moore manages to get some big laughs out of a very sorrowful movie. And this movie does tug at all your emotions. Laughing at banks which hand out guns, turns to shock during the actual columbine footage (overlapped with radio news covering the tragedy, and the call to 911 from the school). From there, you're given more laughs, but when you hear the story of the young boy who shot and killed a little girl, your heart just sinks. The movie ends with an absurd interview with Charlton Heston in which Moore not only comes out on top, but makes Heston look (even more) like a geriatric bigot with nothing better to do than dance on the graves of victims of gun violence. Left or Right, gun owner, or gun hater, every American should see this movie. If you don't agree with it, fine, but at least it will generate debate. For those of you giving 1 stars simply because of what you heard inside the Kodak Theater, then shame on you.

The film is filled with positive messages and looks on life. Many will complain about its inaccuracy and loose definitions of a 'time line'. This is of no importance. For instance, the statement 'life is beautiful', can be argued to death as being 'accurate' or 'inaccurate', but it does not change the fact that the message is positive for society as a whole. The same way this film's many messages on gun control are also positive for America and the world as a whole.
America's lack of gun control is appalling. Abroad, I do not have one friend that owns a gun, while in a America, I would be lucky to find one that didn't own any. This by definition creates many, unnecessary, 'accidents' waiting to happen. This film is a humorous and entertaining account of 'a step in the right direction' for increasing gun control, and I am very pleased that it is watched by so many and unappreciated by so few.

In other words, this is a thought provoking movie that is truly provocative.
You will see Charles Heston wring his hands in nervousness after he says, ""We don't want any more of that civil rights business going on again"", or ""the reason America is violent is because of all the mixed ethnicities.""  What an idiot.
And that is just what Michael Moore does, he shows people and the government in their natural element speaking freely, and shows us how insane they are and sound.  From George Bush proclaiming that our number one priority should be defense spending when people all over the country are out of work and children are living in poverty without parent supervision, to the crackpot rednecks who are buying more ""guns and ammo"" because they want to protect themselves from the ""evil doers.""  It's this candid honesty of Moore's subjects that makes us look inward to how this country gone astray.  Then Moore tries to explain this with his amazing short animation movie ""A Brief History of the United States of America.""  Although he simplifies everything, and it is truly brief, it hits home and is certainly eye opening.
Moore tries to explain the question of why America is so violent. Why we are the unique country in the world that kills people with guns on the astronomical level that the United States does.  He offers a lot of options to this answer, but ultimately, he leaves the question open for the viewer to search out within him/herself for the answer and make change.

His interview with Marilyn Manson will be a revelation to many people, although if you're like me and listen to Manson's music, you'll learn nothing new from it. The problems in the film come from how Moore frames the arguement:
(1.)It's not the fault of Kmart that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the two boys from Columbine, shot their classmates. Why not interview the Littlerock police departments sherrif and find out why the police didn't intervene when it was discovered that Harris posted death threats and an enemies list on his website BEFORE the shootings and how the police knew about this and did nothing.
(2.)It's not Dick Clark's fault that that boy in Michigan shot his classmate. Why not blame the boys uncle--the man who left his gun out? Maybe because the uncle is a poor black man and Clark is a very famous, wealthy white man? See below.
(3.)Moore's portrayal of race in America is so biased that it's ridiculous. His whole thesis on the American media conglomerating in an effort to villainise black men is a ridiculous conspiracy theory. I beleive it 100% that the show ""Cops"" unfairly targets poor people, but it's not a vehicle for publicising the arrests of blacks. His entire emphasis is on ""poor,crazy,white middle American gun fanatics"", with no concentration at all on inner city gang violence except when he argues that it's mostly a concoction by the racist media.

Truly, you have to admire Moore for his story telling.
I have absolutely no inclination of getting into left or right wing accusations because it is a documentary, a polemic one -- and what is wrong with that? -- and does a terrific job of it. Websites and counter-theories abound re. how BFC is [false] or why Moore should be discredited. Well, Moore *is* an intentionally factious director/writer, so anyone not familiar with his ways is likely to feel gyped. But he always has very true, relevant, well-argued hypotheses and pulls out some of the most endearing footage to support them.
If this was a straight-on documentary, it would be on National Geographic or the Discovery channel. It wasn't. This was a ""Hollywood movie"", with good reason. That is what Michael does, and much to the chagrin of people like you (and me) he does it rather well.
The only thing that I find somewhat quaint, if not laugh-out-loud funny, is Moore being awarded the ""Best documentary"" Oscar, which confuses people into believing that this was your everyday documentary, and should thus have kept to the rigor and honesty expected of such productions.

While there still remain plenty of places you can go for soul food, spiritual nourishment, and artistic inspiration, there are few contemporary popular media creations that will affect you the way Michael Moore's do. From his early films such as Roger and Me and Canadian Bacon, to his latest book Stupid White Men and his next film project on alleged links between Bush Se&ntilde;or and bin Laden, Moore's style of identifying socially relevant issues and painting poignant contrasts that shatter popular perceptions has become increasingly penetrating and compelling.
Bowling for Columbine is an exploration into American values, culture and character. An association of the title can be drawn with the hunting expression ""Out for Bear/blood/etc.,"" and while it fits, as if it were an answer to a Mensa word puzzle  -a mark of Moore's wry wit- it is just the beginning, a carnival barker's invitation to come in and be entertained. This film is a collage of various perspectives on the gun issue which Moore assembled in his pursuit of some sort of answer to a situation that culminated in the murders at Columbine high school in Littleton, Colorado. The reference to bowling is not flippant, there is a link to the dictators of that fateful day and perhaps into their machinations.
From an  icy quote by Charleton Heston, ""From my cold...dead...hands!"", which Heston pronounces at an NRA meeting to express his loathing to let go his guns, to the heart wrenching story of kindergarten tragedy, Moore makes numerous stops in likely and not so likely locales, looking for clues as to why more than one person is murdered every single hour of every single day, by gun, in the USA. He travels to Littleton to talk to former classmates of the killers, and he travels to Toronto, to get a glimpse of what he sees as successful public housing and to see whether people actually do (can you believe it?), leave their doors unlocked. He even hits small town (Tim Horton's parking lot), Ontario for some down home takes on why there are fewer gun problems in Canada. We hear victims' perspectives and we witness their mission to regulate ammunition sales by petitioning a major American retailer. It's a daunting challenge, fraught with similar obstacles to those into which Moore ran when he dogged Roger Smith, former CEO of GM.
Critics attack the veracity of Moore's sources and the accuracy of some of his statistics. They charge that some of the scences were set up or directed and that ""things are not as they appear"". I did check one criticism that an airline employee made regarding a statement in Stupid White Men. I went to an official air industry website and Moore's figure stood shining. I haven't heard Moore's responses either, and I don't anticipate them.  Moore is driven and he wouldn't waste the time. He's pushing as fast and as hard as he can to help the world get a new pair of glasses.
I'm looking forward to this special edition import and -I don't like to say it- would pay double the price for it. I have seen the film and
I will watch it again, but not for its cleverness or special FX or its cinematography, but because I believe that what I am seeing is minimally packaged. In an age where digital enhancement is the rage, and Television and Hollywood take viewers to ever higher limits of distraction and illusion, Michael Moore has his feet on the ground, the mic in his hand, and nothing but questions. The merits of Bowling for Columbine lie in the frankness, humility and simplicity with which the gun issue is presented. One of the strongest notions that I've been struck with in reading and listening to Moore is that he is doing this for the common good. He is trying to help people, and in particular he is trying to help people who need it, which is most of us. That's why I want to support Michael Moore. He's not a powerful man, but he has an important message, and it's gaining momentum. He doesn't pretend to be more clever than anyone, he's just passionate about the truth and he's relentless in his pursuit of it. I'm sure to some he's a nuisance, and to others he's a thorn. But to
me he's fresh air. About as fresh as you can get in these days of smog, gobal warming, and empty political rhetoric.
I'm curious to see what's included in this special import edition. Michael Moore has a lot of experience and I trust he'll make it worth the money. Its message may not be as universally accessible as Beethoven's Fifth, or as simple to understand as Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, but it does raise an issue that affects all of us, and which needs to be addressed, and which is a matter of life and death.",1049587200,11,4703,4.677536231884058

People love it because it says things that other are afraid to admit.  Other people hate it which means there is truth to it or else they would just dismiss it instead.  These traits are true in all great films, books, or any other type of media.  If you can sit down and open your mind you should watch this movie.

1838785,5,B00008DDVU,"It's easy enough to watch this movie and say it's a liberal attempt to dissuade people from owning guns. In fact, most of the information in the picture was regarding American's love affair with guns. But this movie is NOT about gun control. This is a movie about fear. This is a movie about why Americans kill.
From the very beginning, Moore begins to ask the question, ""Why is the murder rate in America so much higher than in other countries."" The answer he came up with? Because Americans live in fear. He illistarted this point in Canada by walking up to front doors and opening them, just to see if they were locked. What town in America could we find this?
After seeing this movie, I realized how much in my life is governed by fear - fear of being robbed, fear for my children, fear of what people will think of me. It startled me how much of my life is based soley on fear... all the precautions I take. Even with 11,000 murders in this country every year, the odds of me getting killed by murder today is astronimical. Same with the odds of me getting robbed, or my children getting kidnapped. It happens, yes. But how many of you know someone that was murdered personally? How many people do you know that have been kidnapped? I'm sure there are a few out there, but for the average person, you don't run across that much. This is the point Moore is making in this movie.
See this film. If you're a ""gun nut"" all the better. Moore makes the point that it's not the guns but the attitude of the people that makes the difference. See the movie, and don't be so quick to get offended. If you're a Charlton Heston fan... well, see the movie anyways, but you might not like what you see.",1049241600,33,1693,4.327044025157233
1838786,5,B00008DDVU,"What makes this film so remarkable is the truth that it ultimately tells. Simplisticly he traces the rampant gun mania in this country back to the origins of this country being on genocide and slavery. I'd seen Moore talk about his film on Oprah at length before I saw this film, as well as the three minute cartoon that traces the US history and shows the paranoia that white people have been engendered with.
A film that focuses on gun control becomes about race and racism. The racial portrayal of people of color in the media, the media eagerly showing particular races ad nauseum commiting crimes, over and over and over, forcing white people to believe their engendered fears about other races. The audience laughed at all the appropriate parts until it became about race, then only the people of color laughed because of the bitter truth of the entire situation. White people are afraid to admit this truth, this fear, this internalized terror that seems to stalk so many to the point of getting as many guns as possible.
Charlton Heston, spokesman for the NRA, is interviewed in the film and even he admits that part of the problem, the crime is because of so many ethnicities in this country.
White people are so afraid. Afraid because America is a Me culture, unlike other countries that have socialized medicine, socialized care for the elderly, and at some level while it affords immediate gratification, we all understand that isn't right.
I don't know how to make White people less scared, to get a population of 280 million to relinquish having 250 million guns or 750 million televisions which honestly is becoming a manifestation of what we all project as ""the Devil"". We're slowly imploding into consumerism, a mentality of attack, attack, attack with a focus on war and destruction and killing each other. Frankly, after leaving the movie, I was ashamed that I lived in a country where our children can turn not only physically, whether purposefully as in Columbine or in Flint, accidentally, to killing. Children are killing. What else do we need as a wake up call?
I took a class man years ago taught by an Indian chief and his lesson was that every culture has armageddon mythology but that American Indian mythology includes that the winds will be out of control, that our weather patterns will no longer make sense and the next that our children will kill. I do believe that the focus of television and video games and movies teaches children HOW to kill and destroy but it is America's lack of emapthy and compassion that teaches them WHY to kill.
When so many people Moore interviewed were asked why they were arming themselves, they came back to the 2nd Amendment, to the necessity to protect themselves, their families, to the fear of the THEM coming for them whether it be government or SOMEONE, colored ultimately and I thought to myself what people of color are taught from a young age: White people are crazy, and now there's a film to support that theory.
Statistically it bears out that Black peopel have actually committed less crime in teh past 10 years than White people, 30% lowering while there has been a 600% increase in teh showing of black men as criminals on TV. Amazingly companies like Enron and World Com that financially rape millions of people of their entire lives are shown briefly before we get back to the projected terrorists and racial dangers here in America. White citizens born into fear and constantly propogandized by television about fearing are arming themselves and ironically as we learned in Columbine, killing themselves. White children go hog wild with guns, white men are more apt to commit suicide and take the family with them, white peopel wage war without the UN support and teh rest of us sit and watch.
I've been to Canada and honestly the White people there are different, maybe it's more space, maybe it's because they are a country committed to caring about people, not just thru lip service but through social and financial commitment---free medical care for EVERYONE, care for the elderly, a higher unemployment rate but a giv't committed to employing it's citizens. A mass of 30 million people who have 7 million guys and less than 200 gun shootings a year. America, 280 million has close to 12,000 gun murders a year. Even by the simplistic math of avering 10 times more in population we should only have 2000 average gun related shootings a year and yet we have 6 times THAT amount.
America is hemorraging from lack of social care for EVERYONE, rich or poor, lack of parental classes, lack of marital classes, lack of integrity, lack of responsible election processes, lack of big business regulation and lack of respect for the world. Its funny how this film correlates the ideology into the political system, but like a disease this is rampant to the very concept of the 3 card monte deal of hunting for Osama to blaming Saddam Hussein for the world's teroristic problems. Bush knows how many weapons of mass destruction are in Iraq, why?> because his daddy sold them to Iraq when Hussein was helped to established power by the US to oppose Iran. We didn't care about the actions of teh regime then, it was only when oil prices went up that we became concerned about the second largest producer of oil on the planet.
Curiously enough I got an email about my initial review of thsi film that told me to ""go back home"" if I didn't like it here. In truth, I am Naragansett Indian, an undistrubed line from my great-grandfather, anyone not of American Indian descent is on MY land my the legal possession rights of America. I am home. But hasn't that always been the racist yell from the battle for Integration, to vote, to exist? That if anyone here in America disagrees, as supposedly allowed in a democracy, they should :go back to where THEY came from"". Again that ""THEM"". I expect that not every person of any color shares the masses attitudes, except perhaps in this country that through first genocide of millions of Indians and then slavery of several races to build up the financial base became the mess we have today.",1049241600,16,6107,4.735211267605634

If you are a human being that cares, has  feelings, wants to know what is happening in USA and appreciates art, go and see it, I promise you will love it.

Good movies give you that emotionally fresh, post-cathartic feeling.  Great movies make you take a long stare at yourself and reconsider how you look at things.  This movie does both, and how!
I felt a little sorry for trembling Chuck Heston getting blind-sided in Moore's interview, but in light of the NRA rallies being held immediately after both school-shootings, he had no teneble explanation or recourse, but to hobble quickly away.  Did anyone else find it humorous that Heston was giving his presentation to the NRA assembled FROM BEHIND BULLETPROOF GLASS SHIELDS?
Many documentaries are barely watchable, but Moore's movie is thoughtful, nuanced and enjoyable from start to finish--the best-tasting medicine America needs.

I took over a dozen of my friends to see this movie even though the movie theaters charge more to see it than I make at two hours of work. Don't get me wrong it was worth every penny when I saw the look on my friends faces after Mr. Moore's facts and interviews. It was was almost calming to now know that my friends who were somewhat in the dark before seeing the film, that they now have an understanding that our country is not the land of perpetual bliss as it is always described as. So for all you who would like to know the truth and understand our problems and infatuation with guns and violence this is a good start, but definitly not the finish. Americans open your eyes,listen to what people have to say and then make your own decision about what to do and then do something about it!!!  Thank You Michael Moore.

1838830,3,B00008DDVU,"To say this is a documentary is to say facts are not important to documentaries.
I enjoyed this film because I can see it for what it is.  Kind of like Stone's JFK, a slanted view, even fictious view, of the facts to produce a certain impact upon the viewer.
I.E.:  The Willie Horton ad in the moive was composed from two different ads, and the words ""And he kills again"" were put in there by Moore to shock the viewer, Horton [attacked] a woman not killed her.
The Heston speech at Devner was edited from 3 different speeches to produce a speech which he never gave.  The NRA ""gun rally"" was in fact a convention organized 4 years prior that was curtailed in deffernce to the shooting.
The Flint rally occured 8 months after the shooting, and during a campain season.  Yet Moore gives the impression it happened within days of the shooting.
The end scene was reshot by Moore to get the two POVs used, or else how can the viewer not see another camera.
All in all, I enjoyed this movie, though I cannot take it seriously, like JFK.  If you have a grasp on reality and can see this for what it is you'll enjoy it.  If you don't have a grasp on reality and really think LBJ escalated the Vietnam War to sell more helocoptors then you'll like this as well.",1049155200,6,1253,4.288135593220339

I do believe that the majority of Americans want peace and not war, that they want raw truth and NOT padded Bush approved dribble.

It may be ""over the top"" in a few scenarios, but those only lend themselves to discussion about arguing a point. It is problematic that those who would be the least likely to watch this film, would be the ones who might benefit the most from it. It is a film that transcends the intuitive about the violent culture that we attempt to thrive in. While you watch it, you are watching what you know already, but have never seen it elucidated.  Perhaps not quite elegantly, but it's there nonetheless. It is quite poignant in it's telling of the relationship of American media to our culture. We are Hollywood, n'est pas?

See this film with somebody and then talk to them about it. Excercise that great right afforded to you by living in this country.
I have seen this film 4 times and it is not about gun control!  I think the title and the brash, in-your-face stance of the film have caused many viewers to jump to hasty opinions. There are three issues in regard to this film that in my humble opinion are far more important and discussion worthy than gun control:
1) US history of violent foreign policy blunders. (I had American friends in El Salvador, and I was in Muslim SE Asia during the bombing of Sudan)
2) The atmosphere of fear created and perpetuated by the popular media.
* C'mon - I know some of you didn't enjoy the eve of Dec 31st, 1999.
* I was scared of the African Bees too
* Every classroom at the school where I teach has been issued duct tape and plastic even though the only building of noteworthy stature in the area is a wooden roller coaster.
* If you don't chuckle when the White House issues a ""blanket alert"" in response to a ""general threat"" then you may be lost already with this issue.  And if you think that the White House issues those timely alerts because they are concerned about your safety then you are hopelessly lost.
3) Is this film really a ""documentary""??
Regardless of your opinion on the third issue - you owe it to yourself to see ""Bowling for Columbine."" I look forward to reading your review and hearing your thoughtful opinion.

1838858,1,B00008DDVU,"Ultra liberal?  Hmmm, well definately not conservative.  Michael Moore is making another attempt to point the finger and show you who is to blame.  In Roger and Me, he pointed the finger at corporate america as the plight of the american work force.  In Bowling for Columbine it's the ancient views of the conservatives and the right to bare arms, of which I am in favor in.  Again, at the Academy awards the finger was pointed at our President, calling him a ficticious president.  It's much easier to point the finger than to take the resposibility for oneself, especially when pointing the finger proves itself as a good way to make a living.
If guns in society are truly the problem then how do you explain the increasing rate of children under 12 committing sexual molestation, rape and murder, without the use of guns?  What will you point your finger at next Mr. Moore?  At what point will we admit that it just may be the lack of moral and religious values that we instill in our children?  Society has become so cautious not to intrude on the values and beliefs of the few, but what will become of the freedom of the masses?  The value of religion in our schools is that it makes individuals resposible for themselves and their sins, even when there are no visible witnesses.
Michael Moore will probably continue to entertain and maintain an audience, just as Jerry Springer has his own group of viewers.  And in good form, I wish him the best of luck.",1048896000,15,1461,4.559386973180077
1838859,4,B00008DDVU,"In the tradition of ""Roger & Me"" and his two TV series, Michael Moore uses his amazing editing skills to produce a polemical film filled with an astounding amount of irony. I am in awe of his virtuosic editing. The sheer emotional impact of his editing can't be denied. But decision making should be based on more than just emotions. No one can mistake this for an even handed, objective documentary. This is clearly propaganda. To achieve its goal, propaganda doesn't care about facts. It cares about emotions. To sway our emotions, Moore once again relies on his old technique of twisting the truth. Ignored facts, facts out of order, and sometimes outright lies. Many important facts from the pro-gun side are left out: the Founding Fathers' writings, the huge number of people who have defended themselves using guns, and the huge rise in crime rates in countries that have disarmed their citizens. Moore ponders the reason for the high murder rate in the U. S., but never really finds the answer. The best he can offer is a cynically amusing cartoon. As a flaming liberal who is also very pro-gun, I can recommend every Moore production except this one (and ""Canadian Bacon,"" which was just plain lousy). But from a purely cinematic viewpiont, I can't recommend this highly enough. Yes, I'm torn. I certainly hope people will base their final decision on the gun issue on more than this biased, emotional movie. I hope they'll be more dispassionate and get all the facts on both sides. Moore spins an emotionally compelling story, but not the full story. As a Michigan Militia member in the movie asked, ""Who's going to protect you? The cops? the government?"" To his discredit, Moore never deals with the fact that the obvious answer to that question is ""Neither.""",1048896000,5,1769,4.822368421052632

After I left the theater I remember my girlfriend saying that ""everyone should have to watch that movie"" and I agree for the most part. Although, I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone that took part in the Dixie Chicks CD bashing last spring.
This movie takes you on a journey to find out why America is so freaking trigger happy and at no point do they come right out and say it, but you'll know by the end of the film. Moore, like a true patriot, criticizes America, it's government, it's foreign policy, and the media.
At some points it seemed as though Moore was jumping all over the place, talking about American history, the weapons industry, gun laws, the media's treatment of blacks, columbine, and militias. It is apparent though that all of these topics are important in understanding the complexity of America's obsession with violence.
This film has sad moments, hilarious moments, and tense moments, but it seems to be mostly a comedy until the end when Moore confronts Mr. Heston of the NRA. I was shocked at how hard Michael Moore was on Charlton Heston and it kinda gave me a bad feeling. It was a tense awkward scene that almost makes Michael seem like the bad guy. However, at the end, when he leave a picture of a little girl killed in school by a gun it reminds you that Mr. Heston's NRA was only concerned with gun rights when this girl was killed, so they held a rally near her home. I respect Mr. Moore for leaving this scene in tact instead of cutting it down to make himself look better.

Michael says it all - even when he manages not to talk at all. For example, he cruelly lets poor old C. Heston hoist himself on his own petard by letting the kindly old gun worshiper ramble, stumble and smile until finally in low dudgeon he escapes from himself, by walking off the set.  But then, in another scene,  Michael can't shut up - he keeps yakking at Dick Clark, who is unable to get the door of his  van closed fast enough when he discovers what he is up against here.  D.C. just fails to catch Michael's intruding and blabbing head as the door slams shut. The WalMart segments - oh the WalMart segments!  You'll just have to see them for yourselves.

Mr. Moore showed us that he actually favors the right to bear arms, if you actually watched this movie then you know that is true, but that we actually seem more hell bent on causing destruction. ...",1048723200,5,702,4.496062992125984

Although Moore has a clear agenda he compellingly portrays the gun culture that has become deeply entrenched in American society. Moore has developed as a brilliant filmmaker.  He has built on the success of ""Roger and Me"" and created a highly entertaining oscar hit.  His heart is truly in this film.  It is a film of many emotions and an eye opener for those who think America has clean hands.  Buy it now you won't regret it!...",1048636800,4,569,4.755102040816326

It is appalling that it was allowed to be shown as a true storyline.

There is so much here that it would take days, and countless discussions to simply scratch that surface of what the underlying themes are. There are no two ways about it, Moore is preaching to us, but since it is done so well, it is okay.
After reading other opinions about how Moore is using this movie to capitalize on the deaths of countless americans, and the school shootings, and so on... I am compelled to say that people that write reviews like those are obviously missing the point, and (excuse my candid nature) are too daft to watch these types of movies in the first place. They should stick to their boy bands, and their 'Star Wars' movies. Not that 'Star Wars' is a bad movie, it is just not a thinking movie.
Just to reiterate, whether you are pro-gun, anti-gun, or undecided, this film should start you thinking by giving you more knowledge to work with. And as we all know, knowledge is half the battle.",1048636800,15,1252,4.309322033898305

1838891,5,B00008DDVU,"Bowling For Columbine is by far the best film this year.  Moore once again uses straightfoward interviews, news and popular media footage, and his own creative cartoons to challenge fortress America.  The history of guns and gun violence in America is a long and sordid one, being a graduate student in American History, I know.  Moore pleased me immensely with his recognition of this violent history and his willingness to confront the long-standing myths about guns and gun control in the U.S.  While some of the film is difficult to watch and accept as an American raised on American myths, Mr. Moore supports his arguments with plenty of evidence, and any questions viewers have about the film are addressed on Mr. Moore's website.  An excellent and powerful documentary that is a must-see for gun enthusiasts and opponents alike.",1048636800,,835,5.021739130434782
1838892,5,B00008DDVU,"Moore is an American original. No one else in this country is standing up and shoving a ""wait a minute, that's not quite right"" up the rear-ends of some of the most powerful people like he does.
Although his gorilla-style tactics turn off many people (see the Oscars), even his enemies have to admit that he has the balls the size of Wisconsin hanging between those fat thighs. I have no doubt in my mind that if Gore was now in office, and he sent the troops into Iraq using the same political and propaganda-like tactics the Bush administration is using, Moore would've called him out in front of millions, too.
In some ways I agree with Moore's critics when they accuse him of being a manipulator of the facts in order to further his own agenda. But here's the thing: Michael Moore is Michael Moore. Everyone knows of his past work. It is there like a bullet lodged in the throat.  Everyone knew he was going to cause a fuss at the Oscars. Everyone knew that ""Bolwing for Columbine"" would be slanted in a way that would [upset] ... about 60 percent of America. Moore's last movie, ""The Big One,"" felt a little forced in this way(I still loved it). It was just an extension of his stint on television, and never moved the emotions quite like ""Bowling for Columbine."" It's a great expose and a fun romp, and you should see it.

And that's why the argument of manipulation doesn't matter when it comes to ""Bowling for Columbine."" No matter how you look at the facts, they hold water. A dead person is a dead person. So what if Moore leaves things out -- he only has about two hours here. Any good spin doctor -- Moore included -- can weave straw into gold, but the facts are the facts here and they will bring you to tears. There's no denying that if you take what Moore presents to heart, you will come away from the movie simply moved.
""Bowling for Columbine"" is a movie for true patriots, the ones who want to see this country move forward instead of stagnate in a ceasepool of violence. Sure, to some extent, ""guns don't kill people. People kill people."" But Moore tries to answer the question why. In some ways, he comes up empty, but this is a start.
Oh, by the way, I'm pro-gun ownership.
Some people will be turned off by Moore's sarcasm and satirical treatment of his subjects. He basically ambushes a near-senile Charles Heston, but the man deserves it for his insensitivety to victims of murders by guns. The cartoon that breaks up the live-action is hilariously -- and historically -- scary. The footage from the Columbine masacre is horrifying and poingant. The man in the missle factory is blistfully unaware, and Moore whacks him for it. Is that Moore's fault? Any good writer would do the same thing and call him out.
Moore is a cinematic Johnathan Swift.

violence and tragedy that makes for an excellent montage of
truth and speculation involving the state of the NRA and gun issues. Although, imagery in this film is used more so as ""visual puns"" on reality, and does not always portray dates and facts with an accuracy the film does use such a barrage of images as a point of reference to the ugliness that can be inheirent in the gun industry and the NRA. A couple of interviews really stand out in this film, and show a side of our popular film and music heroes that will haunt you if you have feelings to haunt. It shows the old concept of don't judge a book by it's cover, and they are in it for the money ... no doubt about it. Bottom line if you a moderate or a liberal you will like the film ... perhaps even love it.

1838896,5,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine, winner of this year's Academy Award for best documentary film, is the greatest documentary ever made.  Like his other stellar film, Roger & Me, Moore has the uncanny ability to combine tragedy and humor in what is a film for the ages.  Because of the recent situation in Iraq, this film will stimulate discussion as it connects so many relevant issues together, particularly violence and cultural values.
Visually, the film is stunning.  The editing is fabulous, and I can think of no other documentarian, save Errol Morris, who can so skillfully combine the varied interviews, film clips, cartoons and dialogues in a coherent manner.  Unlike some documentaries that lay out a linear narrative, Moore's look at violence in the United States leaves the viewer questioning the ultimate outcome of the weaving that the director undertakes through the various threads of the film.  The skillful editing allows this open-endedness of Bowling for Columbine to emerge.  If you watch this film with friends, you will enjoy how it will stimulate so much varied discussion of the topic.
I viewed Bowling for Columbine as part of a film series at our local college and I did not meet one person who saw the film who was not moved by it.  I believe that anyone who views this film will think differently about violence and the unfortunate role that it plays in all of our lives.
Like Moore's other films, BFC utilizes effective interviews that represent people from all walks of life.  Though the film's title suggests it is a documentary about the Columbine tragedy, Columbine is itself but one case study in a complex picture of violence-from violence on television (COPS), to school violence, to excessive reporting of fear on the news (killer bees), to the proliferation of guns, to the work of defense manufactures and the role of the U.S. government in overthrowing other governments and killing its citizens.  Bowling for Columbine teaches us the important message that violence is a part of our every existence and that the culture of the United States may be unique in the fact that its citizens are victims of gun violence more than any other country.  ""Why do we kill so many people with our guns?,"" this the question Moore sets out to answer in his documentary, but ultimately leaves to his viewers to answer.  This is an incredibly intelligent film!
No doubt Bowling for Columbine will interest educators.  I plan to incorporate it in a number of my classes.  This would also be a great film to show at your local community center film series-it WILL get people talking.  Particularly in times of war, this film may get people to think twice about supporting state-level violence.

Viewers may also come to better appreciate the documentary film form.  As Michael Moore alluded to in his Academy Award acceptance speech, more people should be watching documentaries.  They teach us important things about our lives that feature films cannot.

1838908,5,B00008DDVU,"It's probably Moore's best work, and an interesting film on the reasons for disproportionate gun violence in the United States.
For those who don't know, Moore is probably best known for ""ambushing"" the subjects of his interviews by asking them extremely uncomfortable questions that they probably weren't expecting him to ask. I'm not overly fond of the technique, but it has produced some interesting results.
Though a gun owner, I'm not by any stretch a gun-nut.  However, I really don't think the film is as anti-gun as it is often made out to be. Moore himself has a lifetime membership in the NRA and was a skilled shooter in his youth. On the other hand, there's no denying that he purposely picks some kooks to make the gun people look bad. On the other hand, they are undeniably part of the ""from my cold, dead hand"" crowd.
On the whole, the movie's underlying goal is not to lambast gun ownership itself. Rather, Moore does a decent job of framing the real question: why does the US, which actually doesn't have disproportionate per capita gun ownerhsip compare to many other industrialized countries (such as Canada), have such disproportionate gun violence? He doesn't come down firmly on the side of any particular answer, but he does identify and explore a number of potential reasons. Which, I guess, means that if you aren't interested in the question or don't think there is a problem, it's not a film for you.
There are moments when Moore goes a bit too far with the technique described above, but there are others when he uses it quite effectively. Also, the big ending is an interview with Charleton Heston, which I found interesting, but which I'm not sure actually fits with the seeming overall purpose of the film to ask questions and explore answers. I'm still undecided about that part of it.
Finally, the overall thesis (in my opinion at least) of Bowling For Columbine is that the United States lives in (and perpetuates its own) fear.  Having travelled to many other countries, I find it hard to argue with that thesis, since I too have observed that unfortunate phenomenon about my country.",1048377600,10,2119,4.786885245901639
1838909,4,B00008DDVU,"There are times when Moore is kind of funny, in that cringe-at-the-embarassing-moment kind of way, and there are many, many more times when his holier-than-thou, we-are-the-world pontificated just wears thin.
I was sucked in by the hype of ROGER & ME and then found it dull and less than informative, and I have to admit that I was sucked in for a second time on BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Once again I was misled. Moore does mocumentary humor a lot better than the self-agrandizing proselylizing he too often stumblers into.
On the other hand, any film that can expose Charlton Heston and the NRA for what they are deserves at least 3 stars. Heston is exposed as a fraud and a carny. The lighter moments of the film warrant another star; Moore's own showboating--the final moment of the Heston interview, where he props a photo of a shooting victim in Heston's courtyard, for instance--will make you want to throw up.",1048377600,,914,4.754716981132075
1838910,1,B00008DDVU,"While Moore may be a complete and utter idiot, he has a talent for filmmaking. Moore's own assessment of Bowling is to the point: ""It's funny, poignant and interesting, your perfect Saturday night out."" That might of course be said of good
comedic fiction.
For a documentary, though, one expects more. For example, truth.
The point is not that Bowling is unfair, or lacking in objectivity. One might hope that a documentary would be fair and objective, but nothing rules out a rousing
polemic now and then.
The point is far more fundamental: Bowling for Columbine is dishonest. It is fraudulent. It fixes upon a theme, and advances it, whenever necessary, by deception.
It even uses the audio/video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give, and to turn sympathetic phrases into arrogant ones. You can'teven trust the narrator to read you a plaque, for God's sake.
He shows footage of a B-52 on display at the Air Force Academy, while Moore solemnly pronounces that the plaque under it ""proudly
proclaims that the plane killed Vietnamese people on Christmas Eve of 1972."" Strangely, Moore does not show the plaque.
Actually, the plaque reads that ""Flying out of Utapao Royal Thai Naval Airfield in southeast Thailand, the crew of 'Diamond Lil' shot down a MIG northeast of Hanoi during 'Linebacker II' action on Christmas eve 1972."" This is pretty mild compared to the rest of Bowling, granted. But it illustrates that the viewer can't even trust Moore to honestly read the inscription on a plaque.
In a downright diabolical act, Moore equates the NRA with the Klan, suggesting NRA was founded in
1871, ""the same year that the Klan became an illegal terrorist organization."" Bowling goes on to depict an NRA character helping to light a burning cross.
  Fact: The Klan wasn't founded in 1871, but in 1866, and quickly became a terrorist organization. One might claim that it technically became an ""illegal""
  terrorist organization with passage of the federal Ku Klux Klan Act and Enforcement Act in 1871. These criminalized interference with civil rights, and
  empowered the President to suspend habeas corpus and to use troops to suppress the Klan.
  Fact: The Klan Act and Enforcement Act were signed into law by President Ulysess S. Grant. Grant used their provisions vigorously,
  suspending habeas corpus in South Carolina, sending troops into that and other states; under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made and the Klan
  was dealt a serious (if all too short-lived) blow.
  Fact: Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan earned him unpopularity among many whites, but Frederick Douglass praised him, and an associate
  of Douglass wrote that African-Americans ""will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services.""
  Fact: After Grant left the White House, the NRA elected him as its eighth president.
  Fact: After Grant's term, the NRA elected General Philip Sheridan, who had removed the governors of Texas and Lousiana for failure to oppose Klan
  terror.
  Fact: The affinity of NRA for enemies of the Klan is hardly surprising. The NRA was founded in New York by two former Union officers, its first
  president was an Army of the Potomac commander, and eight of its first ten presidents were Union veterans.
  Fact: During the 1950s and 1960s, groups of blacks organized as NRA chapters in order to obtain surplus military rifles to fight off Klansmen.
The bottom line: can a film be called a documentary when the viewer cannot trust an iota of it, not only the narration, but the video? I suppose film critics could
debate that one for a long time, and some might prefer entertainment and effect to fact and truth. But the Academy Award rules here are specific. Rule 11 lays out
""Special Rules for the Documentary Award."" And it begins with the definition: ""A documentary film is defined as a non-fiction motion picture . . . ."" It goes on to
say that a documentary doesn't always have to show the ""actual occurrence"": it can employ re-enactment, etc., ""as long as the emphasis is on factual content and not
on fiction.""
So when awards night rolls around, we will see whether the Academy follows its own core rule, or decides to ignore it so long as the film is one attacking one Charlton Heston, and the NRA.
That may win an award at Cannes. It may make some serious money. But it is a disgrace to the documentary creator's art.",1048118400,95,4395,4.863087248322148

1838913,5,B00008DDVU,"What makes this film so remarkable is the truth that it ultimately tells. Simplisticly he traces the rampant gun mania in this country back to the origins of this country being on genocide and slavery. I'd seen Moore talk about his film on Oprah at length before I saw this film, as well as the three minute cartoon that traces the US history and shows the paranoia that white people have been engendered with.
A film that focuses on gun control becomes about race and racism. The racial portrayal of people of color in the media, the media eagerly showing particular races ad nauseum commiting crimes, over and over and over, forcing white people to believe their engendered fears about other races. The audience laughed at all the appropriate parts until it became about race, then only the people of color laughed because of the bitter truth of the entire situation. White people are afraid to admit this truth, this fear, this internalized terror that seems to stalk so many to the point of getting as many guns as possible.
Charlton Heston, spokesman for the NRA, is interviewed in the film and even he admits that part of the problem, the crime is because of so many ethnicities in this country.
White people are so afraid. Afraid because America is a Me culture, unlike other countries that have socialized medicine, socialized care for the elderly, and at some level while it affords immediate gratification, we all understand that isn't right.
I don't know how to make White people less scared, to get a population of 280 million to relinquish having 250 million guns or 750 million televisions which honestly is becoming a manifestation of what we all project as ""the Devil"". We're slowly imploding into consumerism, a mentality of attack, attack, attack with a focus on war and destruction and killing each other. Frankly, after leaving the movie, I was ashamed that I lived in a country where our children can turn not only physically, whether purposefully as in Columbine or in Flint, accidentally, to killing. Children are killing. What else do we need as a wake up call?
I took a class man years ago taught by an Indian chief and his lesson was that every culture has armageddon mythology but that American Indian mythology includes that the winds will be out of control, that our weather patterns will no longer make sense and the next that our children will kill. I do believe that the focus of television and video games and movies teaches children HOW to kill and destroy but it is America's lack of emapthy and compassion that teaches them WHY to kill.
When so many people Moore interviewed were asked why they were arming themselves, they came back to the 2nd Amendment, to the necessity to protect themselves, their families, to the fear of the THEM coming for them whether it be government or SOMEONE, colored ultimately and I thought to myself what people of color are taught from a young age: White people are crazy, and now there's a film to support that theory.
Statistically it bears out that Black peopel have actually committed less crime in teh past 10 years than White people, 30% lowering while there has been a 600% increase in teh showing of black men as criminals on TV.  Amazingly companies like Enron and World Com that financially rape millions of people of their entire lives are shown briefly before we get back to the projected terrorists and racial dangers here in America.  White citizens born into fear and constantly propogandized by television about fearing are arming themselves and ironically as we learned in Columbine, killing themselves.  White children go hog wild with guns, white men are more apt to commit suicide and take the family with them, white peopel wage war without the UN support and teh rest of us sit and watch.
I've been to Canada and honestly the White people there are different, maybe it's more space, maybe it's because they are a country committed to caring about people, not just thru lip service but through social and financial commitment---free medical care for EVERYONE, care for the elderly, a higher unemployment rate but a giv't committed to employing it's citizens.  A mass of 30 million people who have 7 million guys and less than 200 gun shootings a year.  America, 280 million has close to 12,000 gun murders a year.  Even by the simplistic math of avering 10 times more in population we should only have 2000 average gun related shootings a year and yet we have 6 times THAT amount.
America is hemorraging from lack of social care for EVERYONE, rich or poor, lack of parental classes, lack of marital classes, lack of integrity, lack of responsible election processes, lack of big business regulation and lack of respect for the world.  Its funny how this film correlates the ideology into the political system, but like a disease this is rampant to the very concept of the 3 card monte deal of hunting for Osama to blaming Saddam Hussein for the world's teroristic problems.  Bush knows how many weapons of mass destruction are in Iraq, why?>  because his daddy sold them to Iraq when Hussein was helped to established power by the US to oppose Iran.  We didn't care about the actions of teh regime then, it was only when oil prices went up that we became concerned about the second largest producer of oil on the planet.
Curiously enough I got an email about my initial review of thsi film that told me to ""go back home"" if I didn't like it here.  In truth, I am Naragansett Indian, an undistrubed line from my great-grandfather, anyone not of American Indian descent is on MY land my the legal possession rights of America.  I am home.  But hasn't that always been the racist yell from the battle for Integration, to vote, to exist?  That if anyone here in America disagrees, as supposedly allowed in a democracy, they should :go back to where THEY came from"".  Again that ""THEM"".  I expect that not every person of any color shares the masses attitudes, except perhaps in this country that through first genocide of millions of Indians and then slavery of several races to build up the financial base became the mess we have today.",1047427200,6,6123,4.735211267605634
1838914,5,B00008DDVU,"I think that the ""Bowling For Columbine"" movie is a great documentary about we violence is perceived in our country and other countries.
Despite the title, this movie has very little to do with what happened at Columbine, although you do have the security video from the cafeteria, the 911 calls and the walk through into the K-Mart officees and I also think that the person who made the most sense in this movie is Marilyn Manson with his interview.

Michael Moore may not change your opinions or ideas about gun control and our sickening media, but he will force you to question yourself.",1047254400,14,464,4.179775280898877
1838916,3,B00008DDVU,"""Bowling for Columbine"" is only as enlightening as the viewer is unenlightened. I suppose that might be true for most films, but especially here; independent filmmaker Michael Moore isn't telling me anything I didn't already know about guns, fear and violence in America. The film is a handy, humorous summation of the sad truth, but it lacks the ability to outrage and uncover like Moore's ""Roger & Me"" did in the 1980s.

Moore, who is a little too ""unassuming"" for my taste, especially when he conducts cheap, calculated interviews, does do one thing very well: He captures what it is to live amongst violent elements in America. He visits a gun survivalist training camp, where he finds middle class men firing semi-automatic weapons because, maybe, they can. He interviews high school dropouts who built bombs out of boredom. He goes to Canada and discovers that people just aren't as afraid up there. And he skewers the news media, especially local television stations, which amp up everyone's fear of violence nationwide through bleeding, leading stories even though crime stats show that many crimes have been reduced in the last decade. Moore also tries to cobble some kind of real argument against the NRA without using the gun availability argument -- Moore believes it isn't the problem -- and fails, mostly because, if gun availability isn't the problem, then there is little you can pin on the NRA outside of insensitivity.
 At times, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is funny, at times it's ridiculous, and at times it's inspiring -- as when K-Mart agrees to discontinue the sale of ammunition because Moore trots a few Columbine victims in front of them.
And at the end it's cruel, as Moore arrives at close to dawn to launch a two-minute attack on NRA president Charlton Heston, already suffering from Alzheimer's, by peppering him with ridiculous questions about why Heston showed up in Denver and Flint, Mich., days after school shooting tragedies. Moore dives into Heston so fast that he ravages the actor for thinking America's violent history and mixed ethnicity might have something to do with our modern gun violence.
It is the ""mixed ethnicity"" comments that NRA watchdogs and liberals pounced on -- they wanted to paint Heston was a racist gun goon, I guess -- but to argue that racism has played no role in this nation's violent upbringing is to swear off reality. I'm sure Moore thinks he's pulled a fast one on Ol Moses, but friends I've spoken with since I've seen the movie were split 50/50 on Moore's questionable ethics in that scene.
 ""Bowling for Columbine"" was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Well of course it was, and so it will be all over the world -- the movie is a firm indictment of America's cavalier attitude toward death and violence. It is our greatest problem. ""Bowling for Columbine"" states that fact, and if there are Americans who weren't worried before, may they see this movie and become worried.
 From my own vantage point, I fear Moore's pissed and scared off so much of the pertinent establishment in America that he will live out his career interviewing high school dropouts and bullying Dick Clark as Clark zooms away in a promo van. We can jeer and laugh for a little bit, and Moore might even win the (da da da dum!) Academy Award for this film, but he's painting himself into a jester's corner and, eventually, the crowd is going to file away.",1047081600,13,3407,4.808873720136519

This film is not pro or anti guns. Instead this film looks at the reasons why America uses guns to kill each other with a frequency unmatched anywhere else in the world.
This film is not anti-NRA, Moore actually supports the NRA's mission of teaching gun safety and responsible gun ownership. This film does leave the viewer horrified at the NRA's repeated decision to roll NRA President Heston out to any community grieving after a senseless gun tradgedy to intone his famous line, ""From my cold dead hands"" as he holds a long weapon aloft.
Moore asks the viewer to consider possible root causes for the extraordinary degree of gun violence, and suggests that America has developed a culture of fear (and violence) that lends itself to the overly quick reaching for a gun.
I grew up hunting deer and pigs, owned several rifles, and support the second ammendment and the less malignant actions of the NRA.
That said, I think the second ammendment was written over 200 years ago and perhaps should itself be ammended. Further, I can not condone the reprehensibly insensitive and agressively pain inducing actions of the NRA and Heston.

While I admire the dry, honest thoroughness of researchers like John Donahue and Ian Ayers, and enjoy the fighting if dishonest spirit of John Lott-Rosh, I think Moore will have a much larger effect on publicizing arguments about public policy.

It's this fear that's installed deeply into American culture, especially that of many whites in this country towards of african americans, which Moore illustrates very clearly.

For example the idiot who blames violence on ethnic minorities, which Michael Moore addressed in regards to Canada, something our hateful friend forgot to mention, which has a significant minority population and still significantly lower crime rates.  It examines the origins and nature of our violent society, and was much more anti-violence than anti-gun.  I never even got the impression he wanted guns banned, he showed that guns in places like Canada don't cause the same level of violence, he just wants people to THINK about how our society ended up being so full of fear, hate and violence.  This is a must-see movie if you ever truly thought about issues like gun control and more importantly if you haven't.  I have never liked guns and always advocated for stricter control, but after seeing this movie, and thinking about the issues he pointed out it is easy to see that our culture, not our guns, are what really puts us in danger from each other.  I still think guns should be at least as controlled as a car, but I no longer think that it would solve half as many problems.

I was skeptical at first about this film before I saw it.  I was afraid it was going to be full of anti-gun posturing; a simple ""we hate guns"" proclamation.  But it was not.
""Bowling for Columbine"" may have initially had the agenda of making guns and gun owners look bad.  But the final cut turned out to be a far deeper, abstract statement about the culture of fear in the United States.  It examines, albeit in a round about way, comparisons of CULTURES, not necessarily politics.  Period.
Whether or not Michael Moore twisted the numbers is irrelevent.  His film is a brilliant dissection of American culture.
I have read all of his books, and seen his other films, and this one is probably my favorite.  ""The Big One"" and ""Roger & Me"" are still quite wonderful, though.  And definitely do not forget to read his books ""Downsize This"" and ""Stupid White Men.""

1838946,5,B00008DDVU,"There is a long, repetitive diatribe a couple reviews up in which the reviewer gets on Moore's case for his biased portrayal of the subjects of this movie.  I think that reviewer is missing the point.  Gun control is not the main thrust of the movie, it's that Americans seem to have a great deal more fear than citizens of other countries.  The fact that people shoot criminals is not a rebuttal of that argument, in fact it's more proof.  The reviewer states that there is less violent crime in states where people are allowed to carry concealed weapons, a solution which boils down to ""make criminals afraid as well"".  Anecdotal or not, the evidence presented fits Moore's hypothesis that fear drives much of the violence in this country.  A reading of Chomsky's ""Manufacturing Consent"" (which I'm sure Moore must have drawn from) should further convince you of the media's role in forming public opinion, and in this case fear.
In my personal experience as a Canadian living in the U.S. I find that there is a big difference between the two countries, and that is the difference between capitalism and socialism.  Capitalism can be summed up as ""every man for himself"", while socialism is based on spreading wealth to those who need it.  One engenders competition, the other cooperation.  In America you take what you can get because no one is going to hand anything to you, so naturally you're going to protect what you already have a little more vigorously.  That difference goes a long way to explaining why Americans are more afraid, and why they feel the need to own guns.  In any event, I grew up without locking my door, although I sure lock it now.
Whatever your politics you can't deny that Moore documents a great deal of absurd and dysfunctional behavior in this movie.  He makes the viewer think and more importantly, take a stand.  It is riveting, heartbreaking, disgusting and funny, all at the same time.  this could be the most powerful movie I've seen in years.
Oh, and I'm no fan but Marilyn Manson was one of the most intelligent people interviewed by Moore.  He gained my respect, if not my admiration of his music.",1045958400,8,2139,4.697050938337801

The comparison of the two countries is still effective though, mainly because they are so similar save the gun control and mass media issues. It is a shame he didn't focus more on the gun control aspect. While he says that there are many guns in canada this just simply is inaccurate. It is VERY difficult to aquire firearms here. I find his attack on the NRA justified because, in my humble opinion, they are a large part of the problem. They seem to believe that an individual's freedom to shoot someone is more important than his freedom to not be shot. As for the 'black problem', many black people live in Canada also. They do NOT cause a disproportunate amount of crime, but then again, they came here to escape American prejidice. They were not enslaved here. There is no resentment on either side. Moore's film shows that all people are the same; their behavior reflects the way they have been treated.

Yes, all guns should be properly secured, and people who leave them improperly stored and an accident happens should be punished...
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OWNERS OF 5-GALLON BUCKETS!!!
Similarly, we have a newsmedia that preys on catastrophe. The truth is that in the last 5 years, there have been more killings by guns in schools in Europe than in the US. Some countries outlaw guns all together, while others have very strict laws and procedures to go through. Yet more children are killed there than here, but this fruitcake of a grandstanding filmmaker doesn't tell the whole truth.

1838975,5,B00008DDVU,"Say what you will about this movie and Michael Moore's agenda, he has made a powerful, powerful film.  It is not an anti-gun movie (Moore is apparently a lifetime NRA member).  It is more a reflection on American society and the violence which is so pervasive.  Canadians have millions of guns and their homicide rate by use of the gun is all but nil.  So too many, many other countries -- their homicide by use of the gun dribbles down to almost nonexistent.  In America, over 10,000 people per year are killed by a gun.  The ol' maxim that 'guns don't kill people, people kill people' is perhaps the theme of the film.  The big question is why it is that this country, one espousing such freedom, has such a disproportionate homicide rate.
There are moments of high comedy (South Park's history of America is in the film and it is a hoot) and moments of feelings that go deep (footage from Columbine) and moments of great irony (the quote given by an interviewee just before a rather gruesome list (and footage) of America's history of use of bombs is displayed).  Moore has assembled a tapestry that amazingly weaves in and around Flint, Michigan (and, oddly, bowling) and he has talked with a great many people, from the creators of South Park (students of Columbine) to Charlton Heston, to the father of a child killed at Columbine to gun totin' militamen from his home state, for a diversity of points of view of the issue.
It may seem to some that he is provoking a desired response by his questioning but the reality is that the answers given by those he interviewed speak freely and it is their words, spoken with conviction and sincerity, that ultimately leave the viewer mystified.
The interview with Charlton Heston left me speechless.  The man who boldly proclaims 'from my dead hands' reveals another side of himself.
All in all, the movie is disturbing but it is not brashly so.  It merely reveals to us all the various absurdities in the freedom we so cherish.  This film should be viewed by everyone who is troubled by the violence in this country.",1044921600,40,2065,4.614754098360656
1838976,2,B00008DDVU,"Its ironic the number of reviewers who see this as an anti-gun statement. With as much respect as I can muster they have missed the point, as indeed has Mr Moore.
Mr Moore was making an intelligent and insightful essay into the roots of ALL violence in America, but I suspect he got a bit lost when events caught up with him.
The irony is, gentle reader, that Mr Moore supplies plenty of ammunition for pro-gun people. For example, he shows clearly that Canadian gun ownership is very high, yet has nowhere the level of gun crime as the United States. Pro- rata New Zealand has as high a gun ownership rate as the US, but has less than 100 gun fatalities a year- and that includes suicides and accidents. So if guns cause crime, surely Canada would have as high a rate as the USA? One fellow interviewed points out that gun ownership as increased, yet the rate of crime has gone down. Again, if the guns were the problem wouldnt you see the increase? One women points out that when your house is attacked why do you call the police? Well, she says it is because they are the ones with the guns.
The point is, the film was heading towards making the point that violence is not a single faceted problem, and many factors contribute- maybe music, maybe violent video games, who knows? However, about two thirds through the film, he started to investigate the tragic shooting of a young girl at a school by a six year old boy. Without a doubt, this was a tragic accident, but is it not- and again Mr Moore misses the point- anything more than an accident. Indeed the NRA's own gun safety programmes deal with exactly that situation and isn't it a shame that the boy concerned hadn't seen it.
Previous reviewers have focused on the guns, and not looked at the other points the film have made, such as the dig at US foreign policy. Indeed Mr Moore makes that point, showing that on the day of the columbine shooting there were heavy US airstrikes. Dealing with that suddenley seemed too hard, and he pulled the film back to a superficail argument- ban the guns and suddenley everything is hunky dorey.
Be warned that much of this film is not for the squimish. You will see numerous shootings, and some terrible footage from columbine itself. It is not to be taken lightly.
All in all an interesting view of the USA. It is such a shame that Mr Moore didn't control his emotions, and present a more balanced view.",1044748800,14,2405,4.45578231292517
1838987,5,B00008DDVU,"Moore wants to know why the US has more gun-related homicides than any other Western nation. Surprisingly, he concludes, it isn't only the number or availability of handguns. It's fear. His America is a nation of terrified citizens, haunted by unbalanced media with a relentless daily focus on global and suburban threat, driven to seek refuge in the right to bear arms. Guns and fear are a lethal combination, and the statistics speak for themselves: over 11,000 killings annually, when most other nations don't even make triple digits. Moore's thesis is a surprising one in that it contradicts America's image of brash self-confidence, but the evidence is compelling. There are some wonderful moments in this documentary: Marilyn Manson's surprisingly articulate analysis of why his music is blamed for teen violence and his take on the actual factors which inspire it; a former producer of ""COPS"" frankly admitting that violence makes for good television; and music guru Dick Clark refusing to even listen to (let alone answer) questions about a welfare worker from one of his mall developments. But the real stars are the ordinary people: the police, the teachers, a tearful security expert, the academics, the polticians, and two young survivors of Columbine who, with Moore's help, literally disarm K-Mart.  Moore spends plenty of time on the narrative soapbox and edits together some heavily polemical montages, but for the most part he just rolls tape, asks questions, and lets the idiots bury themselves - none more so than Charlton Heston who, when confronted with uncomfortable questions about NRA strategy and his own apparent racism, is left speechless. As the head of a national organization zealously promoting gun ownership, you'd think he'd have some answers. But he just walks away. What a pity the dead can't do the same.",1044662400,53,1840,5.174496644295302
1838988,1,B00008DDVU,"The 'facts' presented in this movie deserve special attention. The reason for this is that Moore deliberately misleads his audience. For instance, he emphasizes the fact that more than 11,000 Americans die from guns every year. How many of these people were shot by the police while committing a violent crime? He does not say. How many of these people were shot by private citizens while commiting a crime? He does not say. How many of these people committed suicide? He does not say.
When anybody uses a gun in self-defense and in so doing protects an innocent life that is a good thing- and makes the case for private gun ownership. Every suicide is a tragedy. But people will commit suicide with or without guns. Moore obscures the facts by citing aggregate data.
For evidence, Moore relies primarily on anecdotes that depict illegitimate uses of guns. Sure, there are people who will commit violent crimes. That is why having guns legal is a good idea. Honest people who want an effective means of self-defense need guns, and handguns in particular.
Moore interviewed the weirdest gun owners he could find. It is no surprise that, in a country of close to 300 million people, Moore could find five or ten gun owners who were very strange. So what? There are millions of gun owners who are just normal people.
Moore took on Charelton Heston in this movie. Heston is just an actor and a spokesman. Moore could have taken on John Lott instead. Lott is a scholar who did a county by county study on guns. What were his results? Private gun ownership leads to less violent crime and makes honest people safer. Of course, not everyone is safer- criminals are significantly less safe when states adopt concealed carry laws. This is what the statistics show. Lott is the leading scholar on this issue. Moore could have interviewed him, but he is not interested in the real facts.
Moore contends that fear is the reason for Americas' gun death rate. Supposedly, we are all scared, so we get guns and then as we panick from all of this fear, we shoot each other. He emphasizes the fear that white Americans supposedly have for black Americans. Does he list data from any study or survey? No. He shows us a cartoon instead. Anyone over the age of eight who takes this seriously should seek professional help. He claims that the government is scaring us. He claims that the media is scaring us. He claims that 9-11 is scaring us into shooting each other too. Where is his proof? He has none. He makes these claims without substantiating them.
He claims that Canadians, have guns but not fear. How does he prove this? He asked several Canadians. He also found several Canadians who did not lock their doors. Assuming that he did not stage these things, what does this prove? Are we supposed to infer something about entire nations simply because he talked to a couple of people and opened several doors?
There is fear at work here. Moore finds the creepiest gun owners to scare us. Moore uses a few tragedies- Columbine and Flint in particular- to scare us. Never mind about the millions of murders, rapes, beatings, thefts, and other crimes that private guns prevent. He uses the absolute worst examples of private gun use and the strangest gun owners to scare us- and then has the nerve to claim that gun violence derives from others who try to scare us.
There is more than fear mongering in this movie. Moore is also a shameless demagogue. Moore takes two victims from Columbine to KMART. He does this in order to pressure this company into ending its sales of handgun ammunition. He also shows the father of one who died at Columbine. Never mind about the victims of violent crime in places like NYC and Washington DC. These places ban guns, thus leaving decent people at the mercy of violent thugs. Never mind about the thousands who get murdered or brutalized in these illegal gun/high crime areas. Never mind about the facts. Never mind about the truth. Moore is out to play upon people emotions and fears, and will stop at nothing to do it. He could look at the general statistics on gun ownership and crime, but he prefers to exploit the suffering of two Columbine victims. His aim clearly is to evoke strong emotions while suppressing critical thought.
Moore also ignores a major source of violent crime in American. There was an increase in gun violence during the prohibition of alcohol. This gun violence ended when The war on alcohol ended. Now the war on marijuana has gangs shooting it out with each other and the police again. We can end much violent crime and greatly reduce that 11,000+ death statistic figure he cites by legalizing marijuana. Moore ignores this fact.
Bowling for Columbine is a shallow and shameless attempt to demagogue the gun issue. He uses selective, misleading, and anecdotal data to provoke fear of guns and anger against gun rights advocates. He evades the strongest advocates of gun rights so as to avoid having to deal with real arguments and data. He flails at straw men because the facts are against him. Moore sets a new standard for shameless demagoguery and misinformation with this movie. In fact, he is so brazen in the way he tries to scare and manipulate his audience that only closed-minded ideologues will take him seriously. Thinking people will see through his charade easily.",1044576000,50,5327,4.722878625134264

1838992,5,B00008DDVU,"Criticizing Entitlement to Fear, Violence, and Murder
Michael Moore's caustic, and critically important documentary, ""Bowling For Columbine"" will outrage anyone with extremist attitudes about the United States and gun ownership, but will probably resonate with anyone who wants to know why so many Americans kill each other. While Moore is often labeled a leftist, this film is more practical than it is radical. Compelled to understand how and why incidents like the Columbine shootings took place, Moore examines America's longstanding preoccupation with crime, violence, and gun ownership, and he comes to some pretty surprising conclusions.
Moore debunks many prevailing myths about the relationship between gun ownership and violence in America. Gun enthusiasts will be pleased to learn, according to Moore, that it is not easy access to firearms alone that results in so many gun deaths in America. After all, guns of all types are readily available in Canada where the murder rate per capita is far lower than the United States. In terms of America's violent history, Moore points out that nations with an arguably more violent history, including Germany, Japan, and Britain also have a far lower murder rate per capita than the United States. If you believe that the answer must be all of those violent movies and video games, then think again. Moore demonstrates that most developing nations, share America's enthusiasm for violent films and video games, but have a much smaller murder rate per capita. More even examines the assertion of several of his interviewees that it is minorities, particularly black people, who cause so much violent crime. Walking down the streets of Canadian cities, Moore demonstrates that they are as multiethnic as any major American city but hardly as violent. So why does America have a much higher rate of gun related murder and violence than the rest of the developed world?
The answer, according to Moore, is fear. With the help of a hilarious but completely accurate cartoon, Moore demonstrates that from the moment of the Pilgrims' arrival, America was practically founded on fear. Unsurprisingly Moore also demonstrates how successfully the media--particularly televised news--and politicians profit from whipping up fear. As if this were not enough, Moore exposes some of the more outlandish things that popular culture and advertising instruct us to be afraid of such as escalators, prescription drugs, and African ""killer"" bees (the European ones are supposed to be OK). One can't help but remember Franklin Delano Roosevelt's famous declaration that Americans had nothing to fear but fear itself.
Although ""Bowling for Columbine"" is riddled with humor, Moore never resorts to insulting his subjects, even if they seem bizarre. When interviewing members of the Michigan Militia, for example, he treats them with seriousness and respect. Similarly, when interviewing a security consultant in Littleton Colorado, Moore accords him dignity and respect when the detached and objective individual suddenly becomes emotional about the Columbine shootings. Even the supposedly scandalous parts of this film such as Moore's interviews with Kmart management, Dick Clark, and Charlton Heston involve no more than his simply showing them the end results of their beliefs and actions.
It is fascinating to see this documentary in a theatre and to observe the audience's reaction. A friend saw this film in a mall theater with a mostly teenaged audience whom he was sure did not connect with it at all, yet when the film ended the Audience burst into applause. When I saw this film in an upper middle class theater, the older, more affluent audience simply sat stunned long after the last credit had passed. It seemed that having been exposed to a simple but well concealed truth they were now eager for some type of resolution, which, of course, the film could not deliver.",1043712000,38,3912,5.2608
1838993,5,B00008DDVU,"The genius of Michael Moore is not that he makes you laugh (even Adam Sandler can do that!), but that he makes you think after you laugh. Certainly this is not a guffaw-fest, anyone familiar with Moore's work can tell you that his work is fueled by outrage as much as it is by humor.
But despite its unfortunate marketing as a ""hilarious"" film, this is an important movie to see. In fact I would say that everyone in high school and college (and all of you who are beyond that too) should go see this movie. Forget learning about the seperation of powers, this movie should be required viewing for every single class on civics, political science, anthropology and sociology.
There's a certain naivete to the views of those who argue that Moore shouldn't have ""ambushed"" K-Mart, Charleton Heston or Dick Clark and that he overplayed the role of racism in US society. First of all, Moore tried unsucessfully for two whole years to get a sit-down interview with Heston. The tactic of turning up at his house (using a Hollywood Map of the Homes of the Stars) was a desperate last-minute tactic. Anyone who has tried to get a straight answer from a powerful corporation or individual with publicists, assistants and ""communications directors"" will know that you will only get a straight answer when it suits THEM and never when it only suits you. Sound paranoid? Just try calling your local HMO.
With regard to the racism. Maybe Moore was being a bit glib (ditto his laundry list of US foreign policy disasters -all of which are extensively documented by the way by non-partisan groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and by reputable right and left-wing academics -and I don't just mean Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky although I have no quarrel with them-, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde, and even the Frankfurter Allgemeine). But the essence of his argument is sound.
Racial hierarchy in this country was and is structured by fear. Before the Civil Rights movement, this fear and intimidation was aimed by groups of white people at black people (e.g. the Klan). After the 1950s, this fear was increasingly fostered (often unconsciously or semi-consiously) among white people. The South Park style cartoons were a bit heavy handed but they were probably a better creative choice than some boring academic sitting in an office, and you would NEVER have gotten people to say stuff on camera because they know its not cool to go there. But they say it, you all know (if you're Euro-american) because you've heard them say it around you, if not directly to you.
Likewise fear keeps people (both black and white) from interacting with one another as equals. It may not be ""fear for my life"" type fear but there is a sense of social distance which is the legacy of this fear that ultimately paralyzes the undoubted goodwill that most people have towards one another as individuals, and more often than not renders meaningful human contact between the races contingent, superficial and fragile.
I remember walking around St. Louis and noticing all the well-to-do blocks of houses with security fences, guard posts, 24-hour armed response signs, burglar alarms, one-way street signs and concrete barriers placed at the intersections of their streets with those of the adjacent lower-income (working and poor folks) neighborhoods (oh yeah, the poorer folks were mostly black too) to stop people even driving into their streets from the ""wrong"" side of town. Talk about Fortress America. And these people are free and happy and open-minded? I really don't know.
Moore points out that fear (along with the demands of the ""New Economy"" on poor people) is one of the biggest contributors to social problems (including gun violence) in the United States. A lot of people are taking this idea seriously now (it's not just Moore's own personal bandwagon). Maybe you don't feel like you fear others, but how about this: Do you trust them? If you don't, I would argue that some of that is based in fear -of something whether its the power of a boss to fire you or the idea that you might not be able to feed your kids if ""something"" happens to you. I'm not saying that people shouldn't be careful but the difference between caution and suspicion is much subtler than you think.
One of the best things in the movie was a comment by a Canadian who said something like, ""When we see Americans locking their doors and putting bars on their windows, we don't see them as protecting themselves, we see them as having imprisoned themselves in their own homes."" Think about it for a second, are you really free? Go see the movie and tell me what you think.",1043366400,30,4676,4.781211372064277

The people who use this as a reason are simply uneducated, or perhaps ignorant of film language. Documentary begins, is fulfilled, and ends with bias. Otherwise, there is no story. Does the Decline of Western Civilization have no bias?The fact that Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine is the most prescient, well executed, and downright dangerous to Bush and his oil-huffing cronies cannot be denied.

1839016,3,B00008DDVU,"This documentary, compiled by a nerd-ish yet (controversially) brilliant gentleman named Michael Moore II, has its share of pros and cons, both of which shall be addressed in the this review.
The cons: few, but powerful. First, the five minute ""American History"" animated blur, though highly entertaining and well written, is nothing more than a barrage of wildly misinformed and over-exaggerated stabs at western culture. Offending me is a feat that precious few people are capable of, but the fact that many people who have seen this film actually take this trite as fact is, to me, repugnant. I won't go into any further details, what with the 1,000 word limit and all.
Second, I'll jump on the con bandwagon and say that Moore's interview with Charlton Heston was cruel and pointless. How old is the poor guy? Seventy-something? He has alzheimers too, which I'm sure Moore was aware of. Despicable.
The third a con is more of a set of mildly annoying items thereof, such as the exchange between Moore and Heston towards the end of the film, in which ol' C.H. is beckoned to look at a picture of a young girl he supposedly helped to dispose of by supporting the NRA (the exchange keeps switching between two angles which would be impossible to execute without the cameramen seeing each other). Obviously fake. Other little things as well, such as Moore discussing how there's plenty of racial diversity in Canada (in an attempt to disprove that gun violence in America is caused by blacks) as he walks through different Canadian cities and stops for a brief interview with a black man FROM DETROIT. Way to prove your point, Mikey.
The pros: this film is hilarious. Plain and simple. The ""funny"" boasted in this film is neither of the ""ha-ha"" nor the ""ho-ho"" ilk, but rather of a rare, awkward, almost uncomfortable kind not found in many films. Moore's interviews are mastefully conducted, filmed, etc. Marilyn Manson's interview in particular is (suprisingly) very insightful. He's got a lot of brilliant ideas and he's not afraid to shove them in the face of his opponents.
Overall, because the funny parts slightly outweigh the stupid, annoying, and otherwise outright WRONG parts (and because there's no two-and-a-half star rating) I will recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a comprehensive, well organized, and oftentimes very entertaining look at the American culture's insatiable connection with guns.",1042329600,5,2424,4.987654320987654
1839017,5,B00008DDVU,"Some of the reviews I've been reading of ""Bowling for Columbine"" remind me of a statement that a Canadian makes about Americans in the film - that we don't think before we react.  Obviously, certain people were angered by this film (hopefully everyone was at least once) and for some reason don't like Michael Moore and have written their reviews before letting it all soak in.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" has just that - a lot to soak in.  I will not give away parts of this film because it truly has to be witnessed to be believed.  I can't believe this even came out to the theatres.  I would like to respond to a few things others are saying who obviously don't fully get what is presented in this film.  First off, ""Bowling for Columbine"" IS NOT a comedy.  Yes, it has laughs and funny ironies, but it is not a movie you go to for a good happy laughing experience.  This is a documentary film with a focus on gun control and gun violence, which also includes segments on racism, the media, and other politics.  This is not a movie you just shrug off and giggle at - this movie should not be called ""hilarious"" because it never comes near it.  It is also not for the faint of heart because there is footage of actual shootings, Security camera video from the Columbine High School, and also footage of the second tower of the World Trade Center being attacked.  How anyone could call or expect a film with this footage to be a comedy is beyond me.  I don't consider myself to be a liberal or conservative, but the facts are the facts and yes some things in this film are a little biased and maybe even over exaggerated, but the people who Moore interviews speak for themselves.  Moore isn't ""making them look bad"", they make theirselves look bad.  All I see Moore doing is asking questions...he's not accusing them of anything.  The way they respond is up to them.  I don't have a problem believing these enormously rich famous people like Heston and Clark are represented realistically in this film.  Why should they care?  These guys are so far removed from reality its not even funny. I love Heston fumbling with words trying to justify why he, a rich movie star who lives in a gated fortress probably with his own security team, has to have loaded guns in his house.  Even better is the part with Dick Clark (I won't ruin it). Another scene involves a TV reporter who ""acts"" emotional when covering a story about a murdered child on the air and as soon as the camera is off he starts laughing and worrying about his hair...as soon as its time to go back on - he puts his ""sad"" face on - priceless.  In scenes like these and many others Moore doesn't have to say a word because these people bury themselves.  I wish this kind of footage would be shown more often - footage showing what people are really like when the camera goes off.  Marilyn Manson has one of the best and most intelligent comments in the film about what he would say to the victims of Columbine - Everyone who dislikes Manson should hear what he has to say in this segment.  I'm not really even a fan of his, but he made more sense in 5 sentences than most any other famous people interviewed in the film.  Also of notable mention is Matt Stone of South Park fame who actually attended Columbine High.  His statements are also important - especially the one about High School seeming so important when you're going through it, but when it's over...its really over.  The real stars of ""Bowling for Columbine"" are the non-famous people who either have had first hand experience or just voice their opinions.  These people actually live in the real world...not in some mansion surrounded by guards & yes-men.  I think people are going to be mad at this film because its too much to handle and accept.  I'm not saying that everything in this film is all true, but most of it obviously is and I think the people who hate Moore and call him ""Anti-American"" or ""Communist"" actually just hate the idea of admitting there is truth here about our Country.  It's alright to be an American, a ""good"" American, and still be aware and critical, even angry at the injustices and stupidity that goes on around you.  People who think Moore is ""Anti-American"" should watch his film ""Roger & Me"".  That film is for Americans and about Americans.  The film centers around the closing of a General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan and the devastating effect it had on that town and the thousands of people who lost their jobs.  ""Bowling for Columbine"", like ""Roger & Me"", presents some hard undeniable truths and if people are not ready to deal with them, maybe they should go see something else...better yet, maybe the perfect time to see this is when you're not ready.  This is a very important film, if for anything because it makes you think and form opinions.  Moore doesn't tell you what to think at anytime in his films.  You see what you see and interpret it.  If you're angry when you leave the theatre or emotionally overwhelmed...you should be.",1042070400,51,5007,4.503875968992248
1839018,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore's latest film ""Bowling for Columbine"" is an in your face expose on the insanity of gun violence plaguing the US. It uses Moore's cutting edge humor to get the point across well:  our gun laws or lack thereof are insane.  The film's title comes from the fact that the Columbine shooters went bowling right before their rampage.  And this film includes actual surveillance video of the rampage inside the school.  Another bowling connection is that militias use bowling pins for target practice.
Michael interviews some Michigan Militia in action and find they are just normal people...with some abnormal hobbies.  Then he interviews the brother of Terry Nichols (the Oklahoma City conspirator) and we see a true lunatic in action; among other things he takes his loaded .45 from under his pillow and puts it to his own head...even Michael gets nervous.  Brother Nichols shows his worldliness when Michael asks about Ghandi.  ""I'm not familiar with that.""
He then interviews a Littleton defense worker about Columbine and tries to draw the connection between the world's biggest arms manufacturer and the school shootings.  The worker says ""well we don't bomb someone just cause we don't like them"", and the film cuts to the whole long list of US backed coups most progressives are familiar with.  This makes the point in a flawed way, as we didn't ""bomb"" some of the countries we overthrew, so it comes off as a bit preachy and propagandistic.
We then see that most countries in Europe have annual gun death rates of under 100, while US average is over 11,000.  Then we're in Canada, a very low crime gun culture where people leave their doors open...literally!
Michael interviews Charlton Heston and challenges him on his NRA exploits.  This causes Heston to walk away, but HEY, he did at least do an interview...what Dick Clark does in this film is Despicable.
We end with Michael bringing 2 Columbine victims to Kmart to get them to stop selling bullets.  A small victory in an ocean of gun insanity.
Every American should see this film and then write your Congressman if you've had enough of gun violence in the country.",1042070400,10,2137,4.87292817679558
1839019,5,B00008DDVU,"Ah, isn't it ironic that our society of the spectacle gets to be slapped by a...spectacle like this film?
  ""Bowling for Columbine"" is beyond being ""just"" a very good film, it is a very IMPORTANT film. I don't think i have ever seen a more caustic, more sarcastic, and more piercing political film that this. Do keep in mind that this is actually a documentary, and yet, it keeps putting up incredible numbers at the box office.
  In Europe, 5 weeks after its release you still had to call to reserve tickets for it, as it was sold out everywhere! For a documentary?? Now why would that be?
  Michael Moore takes the issue of guns in America and puts it in its true -gigantic- proportions. Most would (????) see that guns in america perpetuate the violence. But would they be able to connect the dots, or, would they know even where the dots are? Michael Moore not only does, but he does so with  astonishing humor in an age where political correctness ""rules"".
  Moore sets out in America interviewing scores of people about the gun issue and he manages to bring out everything else that lies behind it: the arms industry and how it massively influences american politics (especially foreign politics), the politicians and their ties to the forementioned industry, the impact on the social web, and the downright insanity of american politics in general.
  If a country has over 11.000 people (yes, the figure you read is correct) dead per year due to gun shot wounds while NOT being in some kind of (official) civil war or isn't attacked by someone then this country is dealing with a severe problem.
  The director poses the questions and because he often poses them to people who ARE part of the problem he doesnt always get the answers from them but he does achieve something way more effective: he lets you, the viewer, see the answer(s) for yourself.
  For the millions of Americans who have been victimised by the culture of daily fear promoted by the media (incredibly depicted here) this will be somewhat of a shock as the only person besides Moore who makes sense in the film is Marilyn Manson when he gets interviewed about Columbine!!! Ah, Manson, and of course one of the two creators of South Park (also interviewed).
  Speaking of which, you get a 5 minute cartoon on American History which contains more truth than possibly all the school books you've read together on the subject multiplied by a 1000.
  The true art here is that Moore lets people speak for themselves on an issue they think they understand and yet they make fools of themselves because they obviously don't - or, have no intention to-... The parts where the NRA is concerned are sheer gems.
  Some people said that this astonishing documentary didn't provide ""answers"". I do believe these people were either not watching or saw some other film. ""Bowling for..."" comes short of actually fingerpointing the culprits  to you, but hey, those responsible for the disastrous effects of the gun policy in the U.S are being mentioned in the film, interviewed, or refered to openly. What  more could the director do? Publish their telephone numbers?
  Another thing that certain people obviously failed to understand was that the issue this documentary  deals with is tragifunny on its own and all Moore needs to do is add simply his personal touch to make it even more of a laugher which in turn makes it even more tragic! Which, subsequently, indicates the tremendous political irrationality involved.
  The facts and numbers and fugures you will be confronted in ""Bowling for.."" are overwhelming and do not involve only gun deaths but other issues as well which for most belong to the area of the unknown (and there is a reason for that of course).
  I don't think i have ever seen a film or documentary before where for days i was discussing its highlights with other people that saw it. In fact it's been 2 months now and it still pops up in conversations often.
  All the praising epithets i could find for it would be inadequate. Absolutely essential to see. Easily one of the most important films of the last decade , and that, might be an understatement.",1041465600,18,4140,4.714881780250348
1839020,5,B00008DDVU,"Bowling For Columbine may be a documentary but it certainly makes its way into my top 5 films of last year.  In it, Michael Moore tackles the potentially enormous and, ultimately unanswerable, question of why is there so much violence in America?  Focusing on the tragedy at Columbine as well as the shooting of a six year-old girl by one of her classmates in Flint, Michegan, near Moore's hometown, with an eye to global terrorism this is a powerful film.
Surprisingly there's a lot of humour to be made from the humour, although admitedly much of this is lamentable, laughter being focused firmly on the ridiculous and absurd rather than anything Moore says himself.  He chooses his subjects carefully and lets them do the talking, and from a teenager who's upset that he didn't make No. 1 on a potential bomb-threat list at his high school to a hilarious cartoon take on the origins of violence in America, this will make you laugh out loud more than once.  Of course, much of the laughter may be slightly uneasy given not only the subject matter but also because much of it is of the kind where you will be gasping because you can't quite believe it.  Take for instance, the opening sequence where Moore opens up a bank account and receives a free gun with a background check that only appears to involve him ticking a few boxes.
What came as a surprise to me though, although perhaps looking back at it this was naive, was how political this documentary is.  Several interesting points are made, backed up by admitedly blinkered statistics, but they are still shocking nonetheless.  Of particular note is Marilyn Manson's take on the matter, pointing his finger at world affairs rather than heavy metal music.  Understandably much of the film's appeal may well lay in to what extent you agree with Moore's political views.
However, the main point is that these were genuinely tragic events that Moore finds himself unable to find a satisfactory explanation for, although he explores several avenues.  Such scenes as the security footage of Columbine at the time of the school shooting is some of the most horrendously affecting footage I've seen on film in a while.  The lasting impression seems to be one of despair rather than hope, and this more than anything else, perhaps explains the desperation and violence inherent in society we live in.",1041292800,11,2351,4.797029702970297
1839021,5,B00008DDVU,"I got a chance to see this in a local film festival before its release.  As a native Briton, I was even more interested in the film b/c of the comparison's to Canada this film makes which - in terms of gun control - is very similar to Britain.
When I walked out my mind was racing.  So many issues to discuss, where does one start?  Let me just focus on who should see this.  If you're the type that's anti-guns, you've just got to watch this film, after-all, it's made for you.  If you own an army-surplus store, you may want to avoid it.
Moore has a knack for making people with a lot of power he wishes to target look completely stupid on camera, it's funny to watch frankly, but the point to take is that these folks he goes after truly do not know the magnitude of influence they have over many in this country.  The best conversations happen with one of the creators of South Park and Marilyn Manson - click over to the website for this film to view the interviews - where they disect how  they are individuals who are the target of much criticism when really they are as much against violence as anyone else.
This film focuses a lot of fear that's instilled in us in from the media.  Why is it we only hear bad news every time we turn on the tv?  Why can't we have the opposite?  He doesn't necessarily give answers to questions he puts forth but he does bring some interseting facts to the table to make you wonder why.  Columbine also touches on race issues and how the media reports more ""black"" crime than ""white"".  Interesting interviews with the producer of ""Cops"" touch on why that shows always seem to find a black guy with no shirt on getting in trouble.
And how about the Kmart incident?  This is a truly powerful piece of documentary making considering Moore achieves much more than he ever could from talking to a company.  I won't spoil this, just watch it!
Overall, a great film.  It's obviously one-sided but hey, that's Michael Moore.  Sit back, take it all in, and think about it for many weeks to come.",1041120000,3,2027,4.322751322751323
1839022,5,B00008DDVU,"Words almost fail to describe the impact this movie.  Bowling for Columbine is depressing and satirical, with its numerous interviews with gun/weapons fanatics.  It also has two extremely powerful sections, one debating the number of gun deaths per year in other ""civilized"" countries (and each country's history of violence), the other showing the US's violent tendencies and support of terrorism, ending with a more frightening clip of the plane crashing into the second World Trade Tower.  If you ever wanted an excuse to hate Dick Clark or reeeeeally hate Charlton Heston, or just want to think, go see this movie.",1040342400,5,618,5.16
1839023,5,B00008DDVU,"I think that >Bowling for Columbine< was the best documentary film I have every seen.
It was a school excursion and it was better than expected: Michael Moore himself is an american and he talks about his country as if he doesn`t like it(it may seem so), but he shows the whole nation that he-as an american-know how they behave and that they are not the heros people believe.
He mentiones in his film several historical dates and facts about the US which makes it more easily to unterstand.
If you don`t know what to do the whole christmas holidays you should watch this ""movie"". It`s worth it!

1839024,5,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore documentaries aren't linear. ""Bowling for Columbine"" explores a mystery: Why does the US have so many per capita gun deaths, compared to other similar countries? He takes you here and there, first scanning the horizon, then zooming in to look at various details, then jumping to another focus.....looking for clues to the mystery. Of course, he has a point-of-view and he is selecting the clues. Nevertheless, he provides information that you will rarely find elsewhere.
This documentary is not an attack on gun ownership. His message is a lot subtler, and the two solutions to the mystery that he identifies are worth thinking about. He may have hit the nail on the head. Listen:
Near the end of the documentary is an interview with Charleton Heston that, in itself, is worth the price of admission. Charlton Heston, the head of the NRA, comes to one of the same conclusions as Michael Moore does. One conservative, one liberal.... same answer. Amazing!",1040083200,3,968,4.981481481481482

1839046,5,B00008DDVU,"As I left the theater after watching Micheal Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" I was drowning in thought about what I had just seen. As a young American entering the work force in less than a year, I found some of the film disturbing (footage from the security cameras inside Columbine High School during the shooting), some of it inspiring (he and 2 survivors of Columbine visit Kmart corporate headquarters), and some of it downright hilarious (Chris Rock's take on how to control gun violence). Ultimately, that's what I love in a movie. Some may critcize the film for not answering the many questions it poses, such as 'Why are there so many more gun deaths in this country than others with roughly the same ratio of guns?' Not every issue has an answer, and unfortunately, gun control in this country is one of them. The film does offer possibilities, and explores both sides of each one, which is refreshing coming from one person. With shows like Crossfire and even Pardon the Interruption, everyone seems to have to have a rigid opinion on everything. Micheal Moore doesn't pretend to know the answers in this film and shows that he, like the rest of us, is human. He just presents the problem to you and leaves you to walk out of the theater and choose to either think about what you've just seen, or just walk away bewildered and confused. ""Bowling for Columbine"" managed to get into my head and make me want to be a difference maker in this counrty. That's what I look for in a movie.",1039392000,41,1493,4.595505617977528
1839047,4,B00008DDVU,"Bowling for Columbine is a documentary about violence in our culture and about our obsession with guns in particular. It is, at times, funny, sad, and shocking, but always thought-provoking.
Michael Moore offers some fascinating statistics about gun homicides in America and other modern countries - The US has hundreds of times more than any other country. He asks average people why they think Americans kills so much more than others, and they are often unintentionally funny and sometimes very sad. He suggests the usual causes for our violent tendencies(the media, violent movies and music, racism). No answers are given and he leaves us to ponder the question. I recommend this for both pro- and anti-gun people.",1039046400,15,718,5.145299145299146
1839048,3,B00008DDVU,"For a long time I've had a love/hate relationship with Michael Moore.  Meaning that I love his politics, but hate his methods.  This film left me in the same place all of his work does, wishing he could make any point without being self indulgent or bending the truth (Canadian authorities suspect him of falsifying the part of the movie where he buys ammunition from a Canadian Wal-Mart).
One of the things about Michael Moore that bothers me is his interview style.  When he talks to people he doesn't agree with he asks stupid passive aggressive questions that even a small child would be able to see through.  Then when they get defensive he acts all surprised and tries to condemn them even more in the viewers eyes.  Yet when he finds people he agrees with he's as soft as Oprah.  Whatever obvious personality flaws Charleton Heston may have, he isn't inarticulate. None the less he seemed to be next to the respectfully treated Marilyn Manson and Matt Stone.
The part of the film I was most annoyed by though was the bullet cartoon.  While the point that Americans are afraid of eachother and this may be one of largest contributers is well taken, the history of America it presents ranges from over simplified to blatently untrue.  Only the final thought of the connection between the NRA and KKK was of any real value.
Ultimately though the biggest flaw of the movie was it's lack of conculsions.  It put out lots of theories about the prevelence of gun violence in America, poverty, welfare reform, culture of fear, racism, the NRA, etc.  It compared gun violence in America to that of other western countries, Germany, France, England, and especially Canada.  It pointed out the silliness of the idea that America's violent history was to blame with these comparisons.  Yet it never tried to point out any other differences that set America apart.  No doubt that question was to big to give a definitive answer, but Moore didn't even try.",1038873600,28,1949,4.730769230769231
1839049,5,B00008DDVU,"I saw this documentary and I have to tell you that I'm becoming a bigger Michael Moore fan with each project he releases.  I loved his latest book, ""Stupid White Men"" and his series, ""The Awful Truth"", was a riot.  This documentary tackles the serious issue of gun control.  While there are very somber moments throughout the film due to the subject matter, Moore also uses humor to get his point across.  And there are scenes in the documentary that are worth the price of admission alone.  When he visits Charleton Heston, for example, it is pure pleasure to see Heston squirming in his seat by the end of the interview when Moore starts asking him questions that he can't answer.  Another interesting interview is with Terry Nichols, one of the men charged in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.  I won't go into details about it but its funny as well.  He gives lots of information about death by guns---the U. S. has an astronomically high rate of around 11,000 a year as compared to, for example, Japan which has 39 deaths.  While there is no easy answer to this huge problem, at least this documentary addresses the issue and gets people to talking about it.  Upon leaving the cinema I heard several groups of people discussing their views on the film and it's subject matter and that is what a director wants to achieve out of his/her film.  Well, done, Mr. Moore.  I look forward to your next take on our society.",1038355200,14,1437,4.5703125

public. i don't know how michael moore puts all this into two hours, which go from incredibly depressing, to disturbingly hilarious, to just plain hilarious. given, this movie could do more to get into the heads of pro-gun militants, and people on the other side ,but these people are usually so close minded and blinded by republican, right wing america, that its virtually useless to try to appeal to them. i loved this movie, michael moore is a genius, and deserves all the praise he can get.",1038096000,5,980,4.703488372093023
1839051,3,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore certainly knows how to put together an entertaining and persuasive documentary. When you leave the theater after this one, however, if you really think about what you've seen rather then simply respond on cue to the implied message, you are left with more questions than answers. Moore seems intent on blaming the NRA and the generally paranoid and gun-crazy tendency of America for events such as Columbine, but he doesn't make much of a case for this. He is mostly content to bombard us with interviews and confrontations in which his intended audience (mainly liberal, upscale and urban) can be relied upon to draw the appropriate conclusions. Where I saw the film, for instance, the audience snickered on cue when camouflage-clad militia men defended their right to bear arms. Dismissive laughter also ensued whenever President Bush or NRA president Charlton Heston appeared on screen. I am not a supporter of either Bush or the NRA, but I resent being manipulated by such tactics, especially when the issue is so complex. Moore himself presents evidence that calls into question some of his (mostly unstated) conclusions. He reveals, for example, that Canadians are just as fond of guns (as well as violent movies) as Americans. So why is their murder rate so much lower? The question remains unanswered. Fair enough --there may not be a simple answer, but the overall tone of this film would have you assume that guns are the essence of the problem. Moore may be more on target (pun intended) when he points out the hypocrisy of President Clinton talking about the tragedy of Columbine at the same time he is authorizing the killing of civilians in Kosovo. No doubt some people will be offended by the portrayal of the U.S. as essentially an aggressive, violent nation, but it's hard to argue with the history of the last fifty years. Moore has created an engaging, informative documentary. I only wish he had presented the material more evenly. At one point, the brother of one of Timothy McVeigh's associates (who was arrrested in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing but had the charges against him dropped), a tofu farmer, is interviewed. Once again, the audience laughed at his supposedly paranoid rantings about the people's right to oppose their government. Later in the film, Moore interviews Marilyn Manson, who sounds articulate and lucid compared to many of the rural right-wing types who preceded him. Of course, this is Moore's film and he has a great deal to say about how his subjects come across. He never confronts Manson about the role his music or lyrics may have played in the lives of the Columbine shooters (who, it is said, listened to Manson). This possible influence is dismissed as beneath consideration. By contrast, when Moore briefly interviews Charlton Heston, he seems callous about Columbine as well as the site of another shooting where Heston appeared at an NRA rally. Heston walks away as Moore tries to show him the photo of a murdered girl. This is effective propaganda, but it proves nothing; we can hardly expect Heston to take responsibility for every shooting that takes place. Interestingly, Moore reveals that he himself is an NRA member, but never elaborates on the reason for this. Bowling For Columbine (the title comes from the fact that the Columbine students went bowling before their shooting spree) is an interesting, though far from conclusive study on gun violence in America. Moore presents enough material to allow you to draw your own conclusions, as long as you don't passively absorb his biases.",1038096000,14,3578,4.98494983277592
1839052,3,B00008DDVU,"How anyone can declare this movie as ""hilarious"" or ""a howl"", ""a hoot"" etc ... is beyond me. Yes, it has some laughs, and some good ones, but, considering the disturbing facts it points out about the American existence ie. 11,000+ murders to Canada's (and most other industrialized countries') fewer than 200, it's hard to leave the film feeling ""refreshed"" as with a good comedy.
Moreover, while Moore does a good job of ferreting out the facts, he also leaves us with an ambiguous feeling that the violence is a product of racism, and does nothing really to address that issue. He sandbags Charlton Heston and Dick Clark shamelessly, and while the viewer is initially brought along on Moore's side, reflection gives one pause. Why couldn't he have been honest about his intentions and allowed for real debate? As it stands, though, Clark and Heston look like unfeeling monsters, while Moore comes off as though he were some kind of crusading saint. Which wouldn't be a bad thing to do, considering the level of the tragedy of gun violence in America and that something really should be done to solve it, instead of sweeping it under the rug, or continuing to allow the media and gun manufacturers to profit from it. However, this film is designed, intentionally or not, to appeal mainly to left-of-center audiences, and alienate those who do not share gun control sympathies. In this regard, if this were to be intended to be used as a tool for change, this film fails because it is basically ""preaching to the choir"". Moore should have spent some time getting into the heads of those who would most oppose a change in our current gun culture and structure his film to effect those folks, and spent a little less time trying to structure his film to make himself look like a hero. For this reason, I do not wholeheartedly agree with this film, but I do recommend it to all Americans who care even the slightest about the violence in our streets and what can be done to make our country safe. This film doesn't provide the answers, but does, very forcefully beg the question and provide grist for debate.",1037577600,8,2105,4.691891891891892
1839053,4,B00008DDVU,"I'm not a huge Michael Moore fan, but I think ""Bowling for Columbine"" may be the best thing he's done. There are some just amazingly funny parts, like the interview with Terry Nichols' brother the organic tofu farmer and gun enthusiast.  And the part about the day of the Columbine shootings is genuinely moving, which I wouldn't have expected given the (often trite) overexposure it's gotten other places.
The best part of the entire movie, perhaps the best 10 or so minutes of documentary film-making I've seen in years, was the section on the school shooting in Flint, Michigan, in which a 6-year-old boy shot and killed a 6-year-old girl with a gun he found where he and his mother were staying because they'd been evicted from their home.  The mother was on Michigan's welfare-to-work program and couldn't pay her rent despite working 70 hours a week.  That part of the movie is a horrifyingly powerful indictment of how this country treats its poor, and it's to the credit of the Flint public officials that Moore interviews that they understand the connection between that family's poverty and the little girl's death.
""Bowling for Columbine"" is about 20-30 minutes too long, and by the time you get to his interview with Charlton Heston it's like ""enough already--we already know that Charlton Heston is a big jerk, why do we need 10 more minutes about what a jerk he is?""  But then, the thing I don't like about Moore is precisely his seeming belief that if he shows what creeps his opponents are, he will have made his political point.  You can get some cheap laughs from the fact that Heston is not just a jerk but also apparently a doddering fool, but it doesn't really contribute to the movie's argument.  It's a gimmick and nothing more.  Individual people can be jerks, can do horribly offensive things, but a problem like the one this movie addresses -- that Americans are so prone to shooting each other -- is not attributable to one or two or ten people.  It's a broader societal and cultural problem and Moore is at his best when he treats it as such.",1037232000,4,2070,4.667582417582418

Compound these social ills with the ease with which firearms are obtained and it becomes apparent why the ""greatest"" nation on earth surpasses all other developed countries in deaths attributed to firearms.  The film is smart, funny at times, serious always and ultimately saddening.  It is my hope that this documentary makes its way into America's education system.  Until then pass the word.

1839055,4,B00008DDVU,"""Bowling for Columbine,"" a documentary by Michael Moore, alludes to the tragic mass murder at Columbine High School in its title. Much of the film is about gun violence and gun ""culture"" in the United States, but the film also explores other related issues: racism, the role of the media, weapons of mass destruction, etc.
Along the way, Moore incorporates an interesting medley of material: old TV commercials, a clip from a comedy concert, promotional film, etc. Much of the film consists of interviews with various people: an official from a school touched by gun violence, controversial singer Marilyn Manson, one of the makers of the TV show COPS, survivors of the Columbine massacre, etc.
Despite the deadly seriousness of his material, Moore uses a lot of humor throughout the film. Some of his interviewees seem to be unintentionally funny--and disturbingly so. Much of the film is also very moving, and even heartbreaking; a couple of interviewees nearly break down and cry on camera.
Moore is a bi-partisan political gadfly in this film, criticizing both Democratic and Republican political administrations with venom. The film is not without flaws. Some of Moore's segments feel too much like ""Candid Camera""-esque ""gotcha!"" stunts. And some of his political ranting seems to be insufficiently backed by comprehensive data.
Still, ""Bowling"" is an undeniably gripping and thought-provoking documentary film. I see Moore as a real champion of the First Amendment, and I admire him for asking some really disturbing questions--and for not flinching when he gets disturbing answers. The whole film seems to build up to Moore's climactic interview with Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association; this part of the film is truly disturbing and at times painful to watch. Whatever your position on gun control and related issues, I recommend this intriguing film as food for thought.",1037059200,14,1905,5.249180327868852
1839066,5,B00008DDVU,"There is a unique kind of gun violence in America.  We all know that.  So does Michael Moore, the confrontational documentary filmmaker who's not afraid to take on some sacred cows.  He goes after his prey with unrelenting forcefulness.  His [tool], however, is a microphone and a film crew.  And his prey are often unwitting accomplices to the concepts he wants to introduce.  He'll use film clips and newsreel footage and music as well as interviews.  And he sure knows how to play with his audience's emotions to make his point. In this case it's an exploration of gun violence in America.
We see Moore opening a bank account in Michigan and receiving a gun as a premium.  We see newsreel footage of the Columbine tragedy and  meet two young survivors who still have bullets in their bodies. We see an interview with an unsuspecting Charlton Heston. The film keeps probing and travels from incident to incident in a seemingly random way.  And yet it keeps escalating in intensity.
In spite of its somber subject, the film is ultimately entertaining.  I laughed out loud at the comic, Chris Rock, who suggested that if bullets cost [a fortune] apiece, there would be no innocent bystanders.  I wept real tears at the film clip of the World Trade Center collapsing.  And I'm doing some deep thinking about the statistics.  Yes, it's true that America has a violent past.  But it's certainly not more violent than the pasts of Germany or France or England, where it's difficult to obtain guns and where there are just a handful gun crimes each year.  But then there is Canada, which also has only a small amount of gun crimes.  And, in Canada, gun possession is as common as in the United States.  So what kinds of conclusion can we draw?  I can't think of any easy answers.  And neither can Moore.  And this is the strength of this film.  It asks questions.  It doesn't give answers.
I give this film a high recommendation.  Don't miss it.  It will give you something to think about.  And you'll want to talk about it too.",1036886400,76,2023,4.612359550561798
1839067,5,B00008DDVU,"You won't find an answer when the house lights come up, but maybe if enough people see this film, we'll finally start talking about guns enough to keep senseless things from happening. Uncompromising in it's focus, you will be uncomfortable while viewing this film. You'll also laugh too. Moore takes several formats ranging from stock footage, historical data, and parody to weave this web, and once you're stuck in it there is no avoiding what he brings to your attention.
At the same time, this film really picks at (white) America's psyche in general and leaves you wondering how on earth our country has managed to make it this far. People may scoff at him, but Marilyn Manson makes one of the best points in the movie. You might really enjoy the works of Charlton Heston, but you'll never look at him the same way again after hearing what comes out of his unprepared mouth.
You may not agree with everything this movie touches on; of course, it's hard to be subjective when you're looking into a mirror. If enough people see this film, maybe we can finally start making choices for the better.",1036886400,12,1099,4.670103092783505
1839068,4,B00008DDVU,"Charlton Heston went to court in a futile attempt to keep director Michael Moore from including footage of an ""ambush"" interview in ""Bowling For Columbine.""  Moore is the scruffy self-styled populist writer with bad hair under a permanent Detroit Tigers baseball cap. During the interview, Heston becomes so unhinged that he walks away, leaving Moore and his bewildered camera crew sitting in the pool house the Heston estate. Moses has left the building ...and it turns out the that the avuncular chairman of the NRA is an inarticulate old coot without his teleprompter. It is moments like this that make ""Bowling For Columbine"" compelling viewing.
Moore takes his agit-prop artistry straight from Saul Alinsky's ""Rules for Radicals"". Alinsky, the notorious grass roots organizer from the Back of the Yards neighborhood of Chicago, advises radicals to personalize their political targets and embarass them into submission. Moore may look like he just fell off a barstool in a Flint Michigan honky tonk, but he is a articulate street fighter in this exploration of the root cause of violence in America. Moore wisely chooses not to argue with the gun toting members of the Michigan militia. Instead, Moore uses the guise of a ""puff interview"" to allow militia members to reveal their lunacy in ungaurded moments. Moore stumbles a bit in his analysis, attributing violence in American culture to nervous white people who buy guns to fend off scary minorities... but even as he shoots from the hip, Moore seldom misses his target.",1036540800,7,1528,5.112
1839069,4,B00008DDVU,"Michael Moore's latest is engaging cinema, to say the least. His sarcastic, ultra-liberal approach to ""the awful truths"" of America have never been so entertaining. It's a cross between Candid Camera and 60 Minutes.
This time, he confronts the gun-culture of America. He highlights the fact that Charleton Heston and his merry band of pro-gun extremists held a rally near Columbine shortly after the tragedy there. Then, he and his ilk held ANOTHER gun-rally shortly after another child/gun tragedy in Flint, MI where a 6-year old child shot and killed a 6-year old classmate (Heston claims in the final interview of the film that he didn't know this had just happened when he appeared in Flint). Heston really shines when he claims that the reason for all of the violence in America is due to ""mixed ethnicity"". This statement is almost as jaw-dropping as Bob Eubanks' anti-semetic joke in Moore's debut, ""Roger & Me"", unless of course, you are a bigot.
Also interviewed, and similarly pathetic, is James Nichols, brother of Terry Nichols and friend of Timothy McVeigh, both convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing. James, of course, is pro-gun, but doesn't believe the right to bear arms includes nuclear weapons (""There are a lot of nuts out there,"" he claims, to the howling delight of the audience).
Marilyn Manson pops up also, commenting on how he was also blamed for Columbine because the idiots that killed at Columbine listened to his music.
Another highlight is when Michael invites two Columbine survivors to join him at the K-mart headquarters in Troy, MI, to ""return the bullets"" that are still embedded in their flesh from the Columbine attack (reportedly purchased from the local K-mart). This stunt results in K-mart's announcement that they will be pulling ammunition off of their shelves, to Moore's own astonishment.
Although there is a lot of serious business in the movie, it is packaged with enough laugh-out-loud footage to make it bearable, even entertaining, even in light of the constant barrage of violence played out on nightly newscasts.
The only major downside is Moore's lack of thoroughness in certain areas. For instance, he claims Canada has as many guns as we do in America, and therefore the death-by-gun rate should be the same (of course Canada has FAR fewer gun-related deaths than the U.S.). However, Canada bans handgun ownership. This is not pointed out.
Also, he tries to blame Michigan's ""Welfare to Work"" program for the classroom shooting of the 6-year old child, his claim being that because the mother of the shooter had to work far from home (via bussing), she had to leave her children in the care of her brother, who owned the gun that the child found and brought to school. This is a stretch, as when he also blames General Motors for this tragedy, inferring that it was because GM ruined Flint, MI that this tragedy occured. These tangents, although interesting, often seem somewhat scattershot.
There are other flaws as well, and many will depend on your viewpoint, but no matter what you think about Michael Moore or gun control, this movie is funny, thought-provoking and will stick with you awhile.",1036454400,5,3155,4.965973534971645
1839070,5,B00008DDVU,"I was truly surprised by this movie.  I've seen Moore's other films, and this one is, I think, easily his best.  It's not often these days when a movie makes you really think long after you exit the theatre.  I don't care if you're a bed-wetting lefty or a gun-packing, bible thumping conservative: get yourself to the theatre and see this movie.  You won't regret it.  It doesn't pander to a particular political agenda quite the way his last two films did, and does an admirable job of trying to address the issue of gun violence in the USA from all sides.  This is an absolutely hilarious, absorbing and fascinating film.  Others have already expressed all of this quite eloquently, so I thought I'd scrutinize Moore's use of Canada in the film as a sort of comparison with which to measure America's gun-related societal ills:
I was proud to see that during the scenes in Canada, my neighborhood was the one that Moore was sent to when he asked someone to direct him to the Canadian equivalent of a ghetto/slum (Ha ha ha!)  And while some Canadians may say (and have expressed on this very page) that Moore exaggerated our easy-going, don't-lock-the-doors mentality and relative safety, I can honestly say as a lifelong resident of downtown Toronto that it isn't quite as misleading and Pollyanna a portrayal as some might think.
Keep in mind that Canadians are modest about flaunting their good qualities and that we too suffer, though on a much smaller scale than Americans, from the constant barrage of fear-inspired American media which creates unwarranted and irrational fear about our surroundings (we get COPS, America's Most Wanted et all) What Moore didn't have time mention was that this ""slum"" that he was sent to is, even more so than many other Toronto neighborhoods, extremely diverse, culturally, racially, economically (it was a planned mixed-income urban community created in the 1970s by wacky leftist politicians) and even though most of us live in public housing and about 50% are classified as low (or no) income, we have one of the lowest crime rates in a city of low crime rates.  And yes, I know people here who don't lock their doors (my mom never did when I was growing up).
When an American friend of the family visited us here a few years ago, in one of our conversations over dinner he let it slip that A) he could not believe how kids in our neighborhood were allowed to play freely on the streets (and no one can remember anyone ever getting kidnapped or murdered or anything of the sort) and B) he was surprised at the huge number of multiracial families here (meaning black/white in this case, of course).  That he should choose to remark on these two points is fairly revealing about American society, I think, and ties into the issues Moore was trying to tackle in his film.  So Michael Moore's portrayal of Canada is not as far from the truth as one might imagine.  I could have taken Mr. Moore to a rougher, poorer neighborhood nearby to ours, but even there one cannot ignore the sense of community and the considerable lack of racial segregation.  Unfortunately, many Torontonians have not spent time in such neighborhoods and are increasingly buying into the American stereotypes of ghettos and applying them to neighborhoods here that, outwardly at least, seem to fit the mold.  These are obviously not the Canadians that Moore interviewed for the film.  Having spent a lot of time in the USA, I can say that many (though by no means all or most) Canadians, not entirely unlike Americans, are unaware of how good they have it.  There is a funny true tale about Toronto that illustrates our general attitudes around guns and gun-violence: in the early 90s, an American ""expert"" on violence in schools was asked - presumably by an overworked, overwrought white school principal who makes his home in the burbs (and I say that based in my experience with so many of them) - to come do a speech at what was considered one of Toronto's toughest inner-city high schools.  During a particularly dramatic moment in the speech, the speaker asked the students to simply raise their hands if they knew or knew of any teenager who had a gun in his or her possession.  The students looked at each other but no one raised their hands.  In a matter of seconds, the whole auditorium had erupted in laughter. (Canadians for you, eh?)  Like those kids, I never knew anyone who owned a firearm in my inner-city high school (in rural Canadian areas gun ownership is much more common).
Getting back on topic -- while it's true that Moore offers no easy solution for America's gun violence woes, there is, I think, a prevailing, simple but too often ignored moral to the film: we should all try harder to ""love thy neighbor"" and gosh, maybe even TRUST thy neighbor in time.",1036368000,8,4796,4.707287933094385
1839071,5,B00008DDVU,"Now I don't agree with a lot of Michael Moore's politics and his methods are about as subtle as a brick through a window, but this movie raises some serious questions not just about gun control, but about America as a whole. As the promo material says: ""Are we a nation of gun nuts, or are we just nuts?""<...
It was a great movie, go see it. And thanks to Moore for making us Canadians look sane.",1036281600,4,396,4.1558441558441555
1839072,5,B00008DDVU,"This film wasn't playing in the town where I live so I drove three hours to a city where I could see it.  It was certainly worth the trip.  Michael Moore's gift for telling it like it is, abundantly evident in this film, was my incentive for traveling that distance and he did not let me down. This two hour documentary film focuses primarily on the peculiar culture of fear that our government and our media have fostered that makes Americans feel the need to keep everything under constant vigilance, secured by locks, keys, and cameras, armed and at the ready for defense.  It focuses on our culture of mistrust and violence.  It shows how painfully shut off from each other we are, as well as how little responsibility we take for the well-being of each other.  It shows a shocking level of ignorance, the ugly stepsister of fear. It is done in Moore's characteristic satirical style and so it is very funny, even entertaining in spots, but it also has heaping measures of his bold, straight-forward questioning of the status quo.  He takes on the NRA as well as several corporate and government programs.  He talks with gun thieves, the Michigan Militia, Terry Nichols' brother James, Charleton Heston, and for the voice of reason, Marilyn Manson. He includes some very shattering footage of the legacy of guns we have turned upon our international neighbors, sometimes ousting freely elected leaders to set up dictators and murderers, as well as siting statistics in terms of body count that these tactics have created.  We squirm in our seats as chilling footage of the legacy of fear trickles hideously down to our children.  We grimace with shame and disgust at the small-minded, ignorant, and painfully narrow viewpoints of our own elected officials, law enforcement, media, and corporate people.  Numerous comparisons are made of other countries around the world with similar backgrounds to ours who do not have thousands and thousands of killings from guns every single year. We stand alone as gun-toting killers.  There are some bright spots that show how ordinary citizens can change this climate of fear and senseless, irrational defensiveness that were encouraging.
  This film is asking us to stop and take a look with common sense and recognize that Chicken Little might have it wrong...maybe the sky is not falling...maybe we don't need to be armed to the teeth.  As with all of Moore's books and films, regardless of your own political viewpoint, you are bound to come away from this film with plenty of food for thought.  You will be asked to pull your head up out of the sand for a couple of hours and take a good look at yourself, our leaders, your future and the future of our country.  Michael Moore is a patriot and this film challenges us to do our own patriotic duty and weigh the facts. See it and think.",1036195200,19,2833,4.774590163934426
1839073,5,B00008DDVU,"I can be just as annoyed with Michael Moore as the next fellow--and not just because his name is similar to mine and he looks a little like me. He is far from immune to the common charges flung at him: manipulator, grandstander, camera hog, knee-jerk radical. Yet all of these accusations become irrelevant when he has a subject equal to his outrage and his caustic wit. ""Bowling for Columbine,"" an impassioned plea for gun control, may well be his finest, most outraged movie yet. Juxtaposing stock footage with modern-day interviews and running commentary, he roils the audience with shocked laughter, then plain old shock, and finally shocked mourning. Moore's great theme is the bottomless capacity of human beings to be both stupid and cruel, and in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" he uncovers abundant stupidity and cruelty. Worthies such as James Nichols (brother of Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols) hang themselves with their own rhapsodic paeans to their love of guns and fear of their fellow man. Moore has an incredible ability to get militia men, drug dealers, bomb throwers and their ilk to confess to their crimes on camera, as if they were talking about their day at the zoo. For Michael Moore, it's always a day at the zoo, and at the end of the movie he stalks particularly big game in the person of Charlton Heston, erstwhile superstar and current NRA president. As Moore grills Heston about the NRA's decision to hold a rally in Flint, Mich., just days after the shooting in Flint of six-year-old Kayla Rolland by her first-grade classmate, he deftly strips away Heston's brave facade to show the hollow man underneath. The Heston interview brings ""Bowling for Columbine"" to a particularly mournful close, as the audience--like Moore--is left wondering when the madness finally will stop. Not any time soon, unfortunately.",1036195200,7,1837,5.006535947712418
1839074,3,B00008DDVU,"This movie is too scattered to offend or persuade anyone. It bludgeons the emotions like ""Titanic"" or ""ET,"" and it has about as much to say. That's why viewers gave it rave reviews and reviewers were lukewarm. I saw it with several other people, and it didn't raise any questions or discussion except for its the strange shortcomings. So bring a date and an extra hanky, it's a great date movie that's guaranteed to not spark an arguement. Everybody likes candy, just don't pretend it's health food.
Moore is at his best describing mid-western life or skewering the media. But Moore is supsiciously like Rush Limbaugh.  Moore and Rush are both chubby little media conglomerates, who are effective at skewering the rest of the media's bias and shortcomings (not exactly heavy lifting) even though each of them bombards his loyal audience (Rush's dittoheads, Moore's ???) with diatribes that are heavy on style, short on facts, and always pushing their own fear-driven agenda about US foriegn policy. In a very real sense, Michael Moore has become the kind of media spawn that he and his viewers supposedly hate and distrust.
Moore's worst is when he says repeatedly that Clinton bombed Kosovo the day of Columbine, and that the Columbine shooters may have been inspired by the bombing. Also, his pointed questions in ""earnest"" puzzled tones worked well when he was needling GM, but when Moore uses exactly the same ""earnest"" tone with shooting victims he's just creepy. Letterman can go convincingly from wiseguy to sincere on a live show, but Moore can't pull that off even with post-production edits, showing his limitation as an interviewer. Another segment described the woman whose 6 year old shot a classmate while she was in a work-to-welfare program. Moore goes on and on about her ""40 mile commute."" Later we see the charter bus the state provided, and the mall where she worked. Sad story, but not the Middle Passage. Moore trying to link Dick Clark to the shooting was like playing ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,""  and his interview of Charlton Heston confirms that Moore isn't afraid of intellectual sparring with 80 year old celebrity spokesmen. And his depiction of Canada is very unrealistic (I've lived there).
""Columbine"" touches on teen alienation and despair in the American consumer culture. Strangely, Moore leaves out issues like Ritalin side-effects, toxic teen sexual relationships, child abuse, and the strings of copy-cat shootings that follow intense media coverage.
Moore also grills a Lockheed-Martin employee (Columbine's biggest employer) about the missiles they make, and asks if it isn't natural for kids to go on a shooting spree because of their anguish over US foriegn policy. People who weren't embarassed for Moore should listen to performance artist Jello Biafra talk about Columbine in ""Hellburbia"" on ""Become the Media."" As Biafra (who grew up near Littleton CO) points out, this was an affluent community of aerospace workers who were mainly evangelicals (people who can pass Defense Dept security polygraphs)whose kids thought the few ""wierdos"" (kids that listened to rock & roll) were ""ruining"" their envangelical public school. Biafra also tackles issues like child abuse and the attraction of becoming an international celebrity by bringing a gun to school. Biafra shares the same political views as Moore, but in 27 minutes he leaves Moore in the dust.
Moore describes gun owners as brain-damaged cowardly racists in constant fear of media-hyped street crime and minorities (those sinister ""other"" people) although he doesn't explain why gun culture is strongest in the areas with fewest minorities. It would be interesting to hold a mirror up to this movie, and see if gun-haters live in constant fear of media-hyped shooting sprees and if for them the sinister ""others"" are rural gun owners. Nope, that would be too complex and potentially ambiguous for Moore, just like sending him and Rush on a blind date.",1036108800,11,3954,5.109737248840804
1839075,4,B00008DDVU,"Moore is more in this outrageously funny documentary.  A little over 2 hours, ""Bowling for Coumbine"" lampoons America's love of the gun.  Moore's comic book style fits the gallows humor and is easy on the audience.
The movie is not subtle; but the issues are.  Through interviews, action videos, cartoons, and stills, Moore underlines Charlton Heston's assessment (given late in the movie in a particularly pathetic interview) that ""the US is a violent nation.""
Towards the middle of the movie, Moore ventures into Canada to discover surprisingly that Canada is also awash in guns.  However, the number of gun-related homicides and suicides is negligible, measured on any scale.  There must be something else afoot here.
The something else, it is suggested, is fear.  Canadians don't lock their doors, and anecdotally at least, do not feel afraid. Americans do.
Moore explores the historical view.  We are largely the sons and daughters of northcentral European outcasts, who descended from the  murderous tribes that eventually became England, Germany, Holland, France, Serbia, and so on.  Looking for religious freedom in the new land, they brought with them their swords, guns, and Bibles.  Then, with Biblical ferocity, they murdered millions of Indians, enslaved millions of Africans and western islanders, and slaughtered several hundred thousand of their own in less than 200 years.  The rest as they say is history.
Violence begets violence and violence begets fear.  Every violent man knows that the next man is also violent and so lives in fear.  Thus, blacks fear whites, whites fear blacks, the rich fear the poor, who fear the rich, and so on.  Under these conditions, it would be downright insane not take up arms to protect ourselves from each other.  This we have done.  And, as President Bush has told us recently, it is important to fire first.
The solvent in which this brew ferments is, in fact, the country itself.  Lockheed Martin, who builds missiles in Littleton, Colorado, the home of the Columbine massacre, is at the center of the film.  Moore interviews its company spokesman on the floor of a Lockheed Martin weapons plant and asks: Is there any similarity between the Columbine murders and our use and sale of weapons of mass destruction overseas?
The viewer is asked to sort this out.  I say shrug it off. Rather, see the movie again, like you would consult a cartoon that tickles your funny bone.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" is a howl.",1035763200,5,2464,5.022167487684729

I was lucky enough to catch Mike's new film yesterday in Seattle, and spent the entire two hours alternately laughing, crying, and gnashing my teeth. Mike takes a comically painful look at America's proclivity for violence and dares to ask the question 'why?'
Some say that we have more guns laying around, or that we watch too many bloody movies, play too graphic video games... Others point out that the Country was built on Native genocide and Slave labor.
In Mike's analysis, that just doesn't add up. The rest of the Western World - and especially Canada - intake just as much violent entertainment, have just as many guns laying around, and have just as much national history of indiscriminate killing and subjugation of other races. What makes us so special when it comes to American gun deaths and our export of violence to the rest of the World?
This film is not anti-gun, it is pro-reality. Everyone in America deserves to be exposed to the ideas and questions posed by this film. It will make you wonder why you lock your doors at night, and steer clear of the 'wrong side of town' - for a whole new set of reasons.
A truly remarkable film. I would watch it 10 more times if it was still playing....",1035504000,11,1216,4.557077625570776
1839087,5,B00008DDVU,"Wow, I saw this movie last night and thought it was extremely well done.  The message that Michael Moore is trying to send to America is very powerful and very justified.  Things are getting way out of hand.
I am Canadian was thus was very interested in the parts of the movie that dealt with Canada, and a comparison of it with the United States.  I will say that Mr. Moore did exagerate in some areas - alot of us actually do lock our doors, and certainly there are worse neighbourhoods than what he showed us.  But still, in general his comparisons were fairly justified and clear.  The statistic that Canada had 165 gun related deaths last year, compared with almost 12000 gun deaths in the States in mindblowing!  Canada has only about 10-15% the population of the states, yet the US has almost 100 times the number of gun related deaths.  It's insane.
Charlton Heston makes himself and the NRA in general look really bad as they callously discard the deaths of students in schools, and don't even want to listen to any kind of statements that might imply there is something wrong with guns.  My favourite Heston quote from the film, which is repeated several times, is ""from my dead hands"" (referring to what it will take to get him to discard his guns).  Like how hardcore can you be about guns, I don't understand.
Also Marilyn Manson was very well spoken and really came off well.  It's interesting that Marilyn Manson came off better than almost every other American they showed in the movie.
I can only hope that many people go out and see this movie and take what it says to heart.  Bravo Mr. Moore.",1035504000,12,1611,4.520689655172414
1839088,5,B00008DDVU,"Just want to add my vote that this documentary is Moore's best film technically, with the cleanest editing and most beautiful, fluid visual and sound choreography of his past 3 films. And, it shows how much he loves America and believes in its people and their potential. In fact, he may have created the most important film of our time.
I feel it is important to write this review because some of the reviewers think Michael Moore (and this film) is anti-gun. They also think he wants us to walk away angry. I disagree. Michael Moore shows us his NRA life-time member card as well as his trophies won in shooting contests. The main theme of the film is, why does America have over 10,000 homicides a year when other countries with just as many guns and ethnicities have under 1,000? Why do Americas keep guns in the house that are not used for sport, fully loaded, when in other countries people (who own guns for sport) don't? Why do Americans, who statistically are in no more danger of being the victim of a crime than anyone in any other part of the world, distrust their neighbor to this extent?
He also delves into the subject of whether we should blame rock music for the violent behavior of high school students, and if so, why not also blame bowling (which is what the kids who blew up Columbine did before they went on their rampage)?  But seriously, he seems to say -- why not blame ourselves? After all, on the same day, America was bombing a third-world country.
Moore also confronts the very important but little-mentioned fact that the media exploits crime, exacerbating peoples' fears, and in doing so, exploits the idea that most criminals are black and hispanic (he fully exploits the irony, that the media blows up petty crimes of minorities while caucasion white-collar executives at companies such as Enron and WorldCom are taking the economy of our entire country into a downward spiral).
Bowling for Columbine gives all of us much to think about, and hopefully will be seen by as many people as possible. Films like this can help us all to remember our responsibility as citizens, not to allow ourselves to act out of fear, but instead, out of love for our neighbor and hope for the world that our children will inherit.",1035504000,8,2244,4.63819095477387
1839089,5,B00008DDVU,"...but...wow!
I mean, all I could say for about ten minutes after watching this film last night was...""wow"".
This is one of the most incredible and important movies ever made.  I think it is also Michael's best.  This movie doesn't point fingers.  It doesn't lay blame (...directly).  It presents the facts and leave it to open to the audience to make the conclusion.  There are no answers given the film.
""Bowling for Columbine"" is an exploration of violence in American society.  Michael honestly can not understand why we are so violent.  He goes through the points that we have as much of a history of violence as other countries, as much violence in our media as other countries, and as many guns in our homes as Canadians.  So why do we have such a staggering amount of gun deaths in this country compared to others?
I'm not here to give you the answer (and neither is Michael), though they seem obvious after watching the movie.  I think what Michael does right with his film this time is hold back.  He is not nearly as incendiary as in his TV show or books.  He let's the people involved speak for themselves.
Agree or disagree with it's points, this is a movie EVERYONE should see.  I am taking everyone I care about to this movie.  It has a few disturbing laughs, and some scenes that really choked me up.
You may have an emotional response to this movie, but PLEASE don't let that scare you off.  I found this film completely inspirational, because it shows that there is still someone out there who believes he can make a difference...and he actually does.",1035417600,8,1569,4.557142857142857
1839090,5,B00008DDVU,"I just went to see Bowling for Columbine for the second time this morning. Of the numberous films I have seen here at the BIFF film festival in Bergen, Norway, this is the best one. As a Norwegian, I felt that the film made an extremely well presented, original point of view about consumer fear, not only viable in the States, but also here in Norway. Even though Marilyn Manson makes only a brief appearance in the film, it is an amazing moment when Moore asks Manson what he would like to say to the Columbine-kids, had he been given the chance to speak directly to them. He replied: 'I wouldn't say anything. I would listen to what they have to say.' How ironic that the person who was being indirectly blamed for influencing the Columbine-killers into executing the murders, is also the only one in the film touching on what may solve the problem with violence and fear: communication, not guns. I am deeply touched and exited about this film, and I recommend everyone to go see it. If not, you will miss out on one of the most original and powerful point of views constructed about a world (at least according to the media) gone mad.",1035331200,11,1139,4.480769230769231
1839091,5,B00008DDVU,"In his previous documentaries, ""Roger and me"" and ""The big One"", Michael Moore targeted some big company leaders (Roger Smith from General Motors, and Phil Knight from Nike) who's fired most of their workers and closed their factories on the U.S. territory while they made hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits - Moore himself used to be a worker in General Motors factory in his native city of Flint, Michigan -, the filmmaker extends his action field and, from the massacre in the Columbine high school, in Littleton, Colorado (where two kids armed from head to toe, killed twelve pupils and one teacher after a bowling game), deals with his whole country addicted to all kinds of fire guns, with an average - and amazing - result of over 11,600 people shot dead every year.
'Whose fault is it, if the Americans are just a bunch of crazy cowboys?' Moore seems to ask in his film, edited like a documentary as well as an investigation. The fault of the whole political class, which organizes illegal destitutions all over the (third) world, finances and gives weapons to dictators and terrorists, sends bombs and missiles everywhere? Of the medias, which permanently keeps on an atmosphere of fear, suspicion and hate through violent and bloody pictures broadcasted daily, in the TV news, with an obvious commercial purpose? Of the poverty which hits mainly the Black people, who - as well as some hard rockers with weird figures and shapes, like Marilyn Manson - are put on an evil level in order to be used as guilty ones every time something wrong happens?
From the supermarket of guns to the bank which gives a rifle as a gift when an account is opened, through an exhilarating cartoon in the ""South Park"" style, resuming in a few minutes the history of America, based upon fear, ignorance of the other in front and blood, the interviews of some teenagers at school, of some gun lovers (including Jerry Nichols, the brother of Terry, one of the two people who destroyed a building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people), who consider the carrying of guns as a duty and a responsibility, and of a disgusting Charlton Heston - he's the president of the NRA (National Rifle Association) which still keeps encouraging the free market of fire guns all over the country -, Michael Moore, within only two hours, manages to tell with strength and an undeniable humor about all the more serious problems in the so-called land of free and the result is an astounding shocker, a great demonstration of the American paranoia, the admittance of powerlessness of a whole manipulated country.

1839093,5,B00008DDVU,"There hasn't been a documentary or a book Moore has done that I haven't liked. Bowling for Columbine is a bittersweet, humorous and, at the same time, upsetting commentary on guns and killing in America. Without stridency, Moore accomplishes this via stock footage, via interviews (notably with one of the Columbine alumnae who happens to be half of the South Park creative team) and through an effort to place an historical frame around the ""killingness"" of the American psyche.
Particularly alarming are an attempted interview with Dick Clark--owner of a Michigan eatery where the mother of a six-year-old (who shot and killed a six-year-old classmate with his uncle's handgun) works. This eatery has applied for tax credits for hiring welfare-to-work employees (only a little obscene, this request for subsidy for underpaid employees). Clark blows Moore off with no pretense of manners or grace. Scary stuff. Even scarier is Moore's sit-down interview with Charlton (call me Chuck) Heston, larger-than-life long-term walking, talking symbol of the NRA. Spouting propaganda and refusing even to discuss anything other than ""every American's right to bear arms,"" Heston is old, shambling and rigidly inarticulate. He is emblematic of so many of the gun-toting people Moore speaks with in the course of the film.
The title, derived from the fact that the two Columbine shooters were on the school's bowling team (a credited part of the sports curriculum) and possibly bowled a couple of games the morning they attacked their fellow students, is at once amusing and, on a deeper level, alarming. When schools start giving credit for bowling, we're in trouble. When heavily armed kids enter a school and shoot other kids at random before taking their own lives, we're in serious trouble.
Using relatively non-violent Canada as an example (among many) of countries with gun-related death rates that don't even register on the American scale is slightly misleading. While it's true that my native Canada has a relatively low murder rate, the societal reasons why are never satisfactorily answered. Still, this film is, to all intents and purposes, a mirror held up to reflect pervasive American attitudes that are rooted in fear; about a media that thrives on bloodshed, and a society that has been taught to fear those who are ""different"": people of color, ethnicity, or  sexual preference.
This is an important, thoughtful, good-humored, and heartstring-tugging film. Don't miss it.

1839094,5,B00008DDVU,"Today, Bowling For Columbine opened in Philly. We went to an afternoon show and it sold out. Matinees do not usually sell out. But a documentary? Amazing.
This is on the surface a story about the Columbine shooting and gun control. But underneath it's a statement about the use of fear as a business tool that insanely inflates the number of killings by guns in this country. Moore keeps asking why do most major countries have under 200 or under 100 deaths a year caused by guns, while the US has... better I don't give the actual number. Find out when you watch the movie. But it is a LOT, LOT more.
I went to see the movie because I read Michael Moore's best selling book Stupid White Men and loved it. Part of my motivation was political. We've been watching the spines of half the democratic members of congress melt away, and Michael's voice has been among the strongest, making the most sense in looking at the thieves and morons in the White House.
I'm 51 and a veteran of the good old days of anti Viet Nam War demonstrations, so I wasn't sure how my 22 year old daughter would like it. But she and her fiancee' both really enjoyed it as a smart, entertaining movie. There are times you break out laughing and times you feel sadness-- over senseless violence and stupidity.
Another reason I went to see this was because I want it to be a commercial success so corporations, that don't care about politics but do care about profits, will invest in more STORIES that depict the world from a more progressive, liberal perspective. We need people who put stories out there that contradict the big lies that the Bush team spews.
One of the reasons I organized my storycon meeting on the art, science and application of story was to explore the power of stories to make the world a better place. Michael Moore is out there at the edges of the story universe, courageously exploring new ways to create, present and use stories to make a difference. The mini story about K-mart, that was a part of this film is a wonderful example of the power of story to make a real difference.
Watch it. You'll be glad you did.

Michael himself is a gun enthusiast and a lifetime member of the NRA, which is a fact brought out in an interview he managed to get with Charleton Heston, who was president of the NRA at the time.

But Michael's film isn't for the squeamish.

It has a 0.3 second, 4 frame depiction of an unintended suicide by an elderly man who stuck a colt .45 revolver in his mouth and tickled the trigger.  The gun had a hair trigger.  Either the man didn't know it did, someone else rigged it that way, or perhaps he simply forgot that the gun had been modified. Most of the spatter hit the ceiling, the gun barrel exits his mouth, and the man jerks left and whatever is left of his face hits the wall before collapsing.  No commentary on the incident is given or necessary.

The film also details how the two boys who massacred teachers and students at their school had spent most of their morning engaged in games at the local bowling alley, although no one there was able to relate whether they actually bowled or used the arcade, and Michael didn't bother to ask.

Because the radical music of musicians like Marilyn Manson had been blamed by residents, Michael also interviewed him about the idea and Marilyn made several good arguments against this idea (and this idea was also floated in the SPLC's discussion of why so many young people self-radicalize themselves with hate).  Music can be as enjoyable as it is influential on a culture or a young person.  With suggestive enough lyrics, a hypnotic melody, and a drug-induced stupor, who knows what else it might do?  But music is a convenient scapegoat for a more serious problem.

Michael took two of the injured victims of Columbine to a K-mart in a mall where the shooters had stocked up on ammo.  One of the boys was in a wheelchair for life; the other boy still had a part of a bullet still lodged between his spine and his aorta, which was inoperable.  Together they appealed to K-mart about the sale of those items to the shooters, and as a result, K-mart stopped selling guns, weapons and ammo after Columbine.

At the time of the Columbine shooting, there were over 11,000 gun deaths in the United States per year.  No other country in which guns are legal can boast a body count that high.  Canada, for example, has plenty of guns, to shoot moose or whatever, but have gun fatalities in the single digits.  They also are so much less afraid of their neighbors or whatever, most Canadians do not even bother to lock their front doors to keep out strangers.  Michael demonstrated this with several randomly selected Canadian homes, and did not get shot for doing so.  This might be an interesting method to decide where to live in the United States, but I wouldn't recommend trying this in a red state.

Michael tried and failed to find a reason for why Americans fear their neighbors so much, but it might have something to do with how this country started.  A lot of native americans were shot to death by the new European settlers.

After the Civil War, white people in red states no doubt had even more to fear from former slaves and their families they had abused for generations.  Michael didn't come right out and say that, but I just did.  Maybe that's also why plantation owners were so fearful about losing slavery.  I don't believe I ever read about that in an American history book, but it makes perfect sense.

An AR-15 is pretty much the perfect weapon for someone who is a lousy shot.  Getting hit by high velocity ammo almost anywhere, vital orgain or not, is sufficient to kill.  These are not toys.  They don't belong in the hands of fearful children.  Those trained in the proper use of firearms in the proper situation already know, if you can't hit the broad side of a barn, an AR-15 should not be your weapon of choice.  It's NOT your ""patriotic duty"" to cause more collateral damage because you are a lousy shot.  There's nothing in the 2nd ammendment about the right of citizens who are blind or who have Parkinson's to possess firearms either, but Michael shows at least one blind citizen who thinks he is entitled to shoot guns - what? - at anything that makes a noise?  Come on.

Guns of higher calibre and velocity like the AR-15 should probably not be sold to anyone unless they take and receive a passing grade in a course on marksmanship, anger (and also fear) management.",1519689600,,4686,4.562200956937799
