8323903,1,B0002XN76O,"Believe it or not our kids love these old Red Skelton shows.  (They are currently 8 and 10 years of age.)  So we've bought various videos in both CD and DVD formats.  This one by Brentwood Home Video is by far the worst video of any sort we've ever run across.  The pictures are fuzzy and there has been no 'cleanup' of either the audio or the video.  In addition, the DVD just stopped at one point in the second show.  No scratch, just nothing. Our experience was so bad we didn't even bother to investigate to see what the problem could have been.

Available for a penny for a good reason.
