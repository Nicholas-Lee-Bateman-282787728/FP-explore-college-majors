8428827,2,B004GKMD8C,"Grandpa (Robert Loggia) has terminal pancreatic cancer; Grandma (Barbara Berrie) has lost her mind; and director Marc Meyers couldn't help but use what seems to be a handheld, shaky camera for the first two-thirds of this film, a big determent in movie-making (or television).  It's like someone was stalking the movie itself (it could've almost passed as another ""Friday the 13th"" sequel if you added the appropriate sound effects and someone with a hockey mask).  There's even a garden scene between mother and son where a branch is in front of the camera, just off to one side!  Bad lighting more often than not, especially with indoor scenes, doesn't help.  Otherwise, there is, at best, minor drama, and there are smatterings of the F-bomb between quarreling siblings to, I guess, make it more realistic?  At least, it's more tolerable in about the final third of the film, when the camera finally, thankfully, stabilizes.  Actually, the background music isn't half bad throughout, but it's particularly sad to see what's surely one of Robert Loggia and Barbara Barrie's last movies be so substandard and forgettable (and Arye Gross is too good for this film), though at least everyone seems to be trying.  If I knew all this before I'd watched it, however, I wouldn't have bothered.  Filmed in Connecticut, if you've read this far ;)",1473811200,,1339,4.973094170403588
8428828,2,B004GKMD8C,"This story about a young man, Josh (Carpenter), compelled to spend his summer before college with his dying grandfather (Loggia), is so badly directed that even the performances suffer. Although the film is from Josh's POV, the director is unable to maintain that; so, the narrative veers off, and Josh disappears for 10 minutes, and you're seeing the plot unfold from another character's POV. Then it's back to Josh. The same is true for simple things like an establishing shot to provide a sense of place; there is one of the house but not of the garden where Josh's mom is working, the neighborhood or the town. So, you are not anchored to a character or to a  place, and then there are awful scenes with terrible songs and no dialogue and inept montages. All of this distances you from the character's emotions. Some characters are never introduced at all, such as grandpa's doctor and a cousin of Josh's, and it's 15 minutes into the movie before you realize that the two adults living in the house with grandpa are not a married couple! You'll also need dramamine to mitigate the effects of the camera movement; it's moving all the time, and in one key scene between Josh and his mom, it hides behind a garden plant so during the entire scene you're peering through the plant.",1470528000,,1282,4.647577092511013

8428830,4,B004GKMD8C,"I enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was well acted and very moving.  While the subject matter is sad, I thought the end was very uplifting.  A good celebration of life.",1360886400,2,168,4.354838709677419
8428831,1,B004GKMD8C,"What was the NY Times thinking?  Disjointed, poorly edited, uneven acting, a total mess.  Never gets off the ground, and a sleepy slow pace.",1356912000,2,140,4.791666666666667
