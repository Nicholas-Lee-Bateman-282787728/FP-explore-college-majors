2449151,2,B000BYW6Y8,"Lisa breaks down the steps, but not clearly.  She demonstrates each sequence exactly two times, FAST, then moves on.  Perhaps there is a rule that exercise DVDs cannot run over 50 minutes??  Since you'll probably need to review each sequence many times before you get it - NOT the same thing as remembering them on cue, or knowing that a particular sequence will be called something like SIDESTEPJAM! during the actual routine - it would have helped if the DVD chapters consisted of one break-down practice sequence each so you could easily click back . . . 300 times.

Also, Lisa does not account for the mirror effect you get while watching TV - that is, if you plan to mirror her (rotsa ruck!), her right is your left, etc.  She may have done better facing a visible mirror with her back facing you, the way you would learn in a dance class.  And while it's nice that the finished product is a real routine, inching awkardly toward a video-ready performance over a course of weeks is not the best use of your workout time.  Cardio-wise, you get about the equivalent of alternately marching and jumping rope at a low speed, with no toning.  If you like good music and a dance-feel to your workout, I would recommend the Turbo Jam DVD series - works right out of the box.",1178582400,5,1272,4.5
2449152,3,B000BYW6Y8,"Clearly for people who catches on to moves pretty quickly. If I was that one, probably would be a great workout.",1178150400,2,112,4.380952380952381
2449153,1,B000BYW6Y8,"This is not made simple.  She goes over the breakdown as if I've been a pro-dancer my whole life.  If you don't know hip hop and just want a good cardio workout, go elsewhere.  I wish I didn't waste my money.",1176940800,5,208,4.024390243902439
2449154,5,B000BYW6Y8,"I liked it.  Really.  If you are a pretty good dancer (in pretty good shape) I think it is a great DVD for you.  Yeah, she runs through it, but if she didn't... once you get to where you know what the moves are... you'll be bored out of your mind during a long repeat each time.

So take the time to watch the ""breakdown"" and challenge yourself.  And if you mess up, just shake a tailfeather until you can hop back in to the routine.

The music could be WAY better.  Yikes.  Talk to a DJ... get some better beats on there.

I wish it was longer too.  As soon as I start breaking it down, it's over.  But, I'll tell you what, I am huffing and puffing and I run 4 miles twice a week.

In closing, I say... buy it.  Life is short.  Dance.",1170547200,6,735,3.9115646258503403
2449155,5,B000BYW6Y8,"There is a breakdown for the steps following the routine. I am a beginner to hip-hop, and though I thought the moves looked crazy, they're awesome! I began practicing them and now I'm getting pretty okay at them - you just have to stick with it! If you have two left feet, you may want to start with another video that is a little more basic...I don't know of any. However, if you have patience and perseverance with your dancing, I would highly recommend this DVD.",1166313600,10,465,4.4186046511627906
2449156,4,B000BYW6Y8,"I love this video that I dance to it 3 times a week.  I had a baby a year ago and it was so difficult to get back in shape but this video coupled with another pilates video did the trick. I love the fact that this video gives you the kind of cardio workout that is lengthening and not bulking.  I tried other cardio videos such as taibo and kickboxing and I developed massive thighs.  This video spends enough time on stretching that elongates your muscles. Also, if you concentrate on your core while doing the dance, you are guaranteed to lose a lot flab in the belly area without the painful and boring crunches. Sure, it was a bit difficult at first to follow the steps but after three sessions, the moves got a lot easier and more fun.  One thing I must say this video is not- it is not boring.  The steps are challenging enough that make you keep coming back to do the workout. The only thing I wish is different is the music half way through the session- didn't care for the beat.  Other than this, I highly recommend it to folks who like to dance but have not ventured into hip hop. Once you get the steps, you'll take pride in knowing you can dance hip hop.",1161907200,8,1166,4.183035714285714
2449157,5,B000BYW6Y8,"I love this dvd.  I agree with the other reviewers; she does bust out with complicated moves right away, even in the warmup.  It is nice for the advanced dancer because it doesn't get boring or move too slow.  I could pick up the warmup moves without trouble, but the workout was another story.  I didn't have a problem finding the explanation of the workout moves (from Scene Select), but she goes over pretty complicated moves twice and moves on to the next one, so I gave up and decided to do the warmup for a while and learn the workout moves slowly.  Also some moves need more explanation, you can hurt your back with some of the torso moves if done incorrectly.  What I like about this dvd is that the warmup and cooldown are the same and the moves are really fun, not hard to learn, keep you moving, get your heart rate up, and seem to be authentic hip-hop.  The camera stays on Lisa and doesn't jump around.  The other dancers look like real people who have been practicing - they are good but you can relate to them.  Lisa throws out helpful reminders (""strong abs"", ""long neck"") but doesn't talk too much.  The stretching moves are good and not boring.  And the workout itself is great, lots of interesting moves, but only 8 counts of 8; it just takes a while to get them all down and can be frustrating at first.",1156982400,6,1323,4.337398373983739
2449158,1,B000BYW6Y8,"Like the other reviewer said, this video is only for advanced dancers, even then I think advanced dancers need some instruction. The video starts and she just busts out with a ton of complicated moves. I pretty much stood there with my mouth open. Watching this video is just like turning on MTV and trying to copy what the dancers are doing in a video. She just starts going crazy and there is no breakdown to the moves AT ALL! Awful!!! I highly recommend D's Hip Hop Aerobics. She breaks down each and every move and it is fun and you learn some fun dance moves. During the workout I didn't really think I was working that hard, but the next morning I woke up sore. I really enjoy that DVD.",1151884800,5,692,4.290076335877862
2449159,1,B000BYW6Y8,I was very disappointed with this DVD.  Although the choreography is interesting she does not break down the moves at all.  I wouldn't reccommend this DVD to anyone who isn't interested in an ADVANCED Hip Hop Cardio routine.,1151712000,2,224,4.868421052631579
8094498,5,B000BYW6Y8,"I just got this recently and I know that it's dated, but the choreography is still appropriate for today. Lisa is a great dancer and choreographer. This is so damn fun to do and you will break a major sweat.",1509408000,,207,4.2
8094499,1,B000BYW6Y8,"This workout is very hard to learn.  Lisa shows the steps quickly a couple times and then moves on to the next ones.  She doesn't break it down at all.  If you are someone who has not had a lot of dance experience aside from dance workouts, I would say to skip this one.  I tried this and could not get it at all.  Her Salsa Made Simple workout was much easier to learn for me.  I will bring this one to my local thrift store.",1444867200,,426,3.895348837209302

8094501,1,B000BYW6Y8,"This DVD with Lisa has excellent dance steps.  Unfortunately, the DVD I received has terrible audio.  The music fades in and out the whole DVD!  I reported this to the seller, who states that it is brand new. I am not sure what happened.",1394755200,,237,4.340909090909091
8094502,1,B000BYW6Y8,This is one of the most complicated dance DVD's I have tried to do. Not enough time taken to demo the moves in the tutorial and absolutely no help during the actual workout.  Nice to look at but not nice to do.,1360454400,,210,4.0

8094504,2,B000BYW6Y8,"I purchased this video based on reviews that I had read. I was very disappointed with this workout. I did not find the steps ""simple"" and trying to keep up with the jerky moves wasn't easy. I did purchase this video used and I am glad that I did. I really don't care for the style or speed of this video and will probably just give it to someone else to try.",1287532800,,358,3.986111111111111
8094505,4,B000BYW6Y8,"Dance with Lisa: Hip Hop Cardio Made Simple is a very fast-moving hip dance workout DVD that is a lot of fun to do once you master the steps.  It is led by Lisa Nunziella who is a very energetic instructor that is a lot of fun to workout with.  Although she moves very quickly from teaching one step to the next, she cues extremely well, making it easy to follow the moves once you get them.

The DVD starts out with a Warm Up which is a short combo made up of some hip hop dance moves.  I found that this was basically a mini workout in itself as Lisa jumps right into these moves right away at full speed with no explanation whatsoever.  It lasts about 8-9 minutes, and it feature a few moves that you will see later on in the main routine.

After this, you move into a Stretch sequence that is very easy to follow with some basic moves such as shoulder rolls mixed in with some basic stretches.  It lasts about 5-6 minutes.

The main Routine comes up which is a Hip Hop Routine that is 8-8 counts in length.  Lisa will teach 4 counts at a time, but she doesn't break them down AT ALL.  She will go full tempo showing you the move 4 times before teaching you the next 4 counts.  After you have a full 8 count, she will go from the top putting everything you've learned together.  The moves range from hops, to kicks, to punches, but no matter what move you are doing, your heart rate will be raised up!  The routine never slows down, but it also isn't that long, being only about 18 minutes.

Next will be an Add Your Own Style section which is basically you doing the entire routine 3 times through.

After you finish doing the routine, you move into the Cool Down which is the same dance combo that you learned in the warm up.  You just repeat it 3 times.

After the Cool Down, you move onto the Final Stretch.  Once again, this is almost exactly like the first stretch, only it doesn't have a few things included in the first one (such as the hip rolls), and it adds a couple more stretches.

And, finally, after all of this, you have the option to have the Breakdown of the Moves taught to you.  This is Lisa breaking down the 8 counts to half time for you to be able to learn slowly.  She will break down each move 2 times without music before breaking down the next move.  Beginners will definitely still have trouble following this, as it isn't really taught to you.  It's more just shown to you at a slower speed than normal.

Overall, beginner exercisers will probably have trouble with this DVD, while intermediate/advanced dancers/exercisers will be able to pick up the moves with practice.  It may be a short workout, but it is extremely cardio, and the moves are a lot of fun to do!  I did take one star off for the length, though.  I think it could have been just a bit longer.

Just as an FYI, this is a re-release of Lisa's older video called Cardio Core Made Simple.  They are the exact same thing, just with different names.",1279152000,,2944,4.244604316546763
8094506,3,B000BYW6Y8,"This dvd is definitely not for beginners, which was a pleasant surprise for me since I have some dance experience and all of the other dance/hip hop dvds I have are too easy so you get bored quickly. I like that she doesn't spend too much time explaining the moves so that your heartrate doesn't go down. If you need more instruction, you can go to the section at the end where she explains each move slowly without music.

The production value is pretty mediocre. The sound on my copy actually comes in and out. Sometimes there is music, but no voice and sometimes it is the reverse - strange. Also, the music really, really sucks -- which is a big reason why I don't do the video often. I mean, all of the dance exercise dvds have boring beat track music (I assume because they can't get the rights to real hip hop music?), but this is particularly bad. The set is also not appealing with a multi-colored curtain that looks like it came from a hot air balloon behind the dancers. Then there are the dancers -- I think she chose them to make herself look good. Not that they don't know the moves, but they have no style and are definitely not dancers you would want to emulate. They also have these cheesy smiles on their faces the whole time.

Overall I gave it 3 stars because it is a good workout and the moves are challenging.",1184630400,2,1331,4.32
8094507,3,B000BYW6Y8,"This is the same review of her Dance with Lisa - Cardio Dance Core Made Simple (this is the same, just renamed/re-released) from June 29, 2006:

This DVD only has options for play & chapter selections. Lisa is a great dancer in great shape, cues well right before you do the move, but needs to explain a bit more. The music is parts of hip hop songs, mostly beats, but some singing, it's not bad.
Warmup: she starts right in with easy or somewhat easy dance moves for 7 min that will get your heart rate going just with that. There's a lot of repetitions, but they were pretty great moves, only a few kicks, step/skips.
Stretch: 5 min, stretches all major muscles including spine, great stretching with some hip bumps
Dance Routine: 20 min. She choose complicated dance steps that require a lot of large steps, hopping, turns, etc. She shows you 4 counts of a dance move at a time in normal speed 3x & then repeats from the beginning of the entire routine as you build.
Cool down: same as the stretch, other DVDs have done this: same warm up as cool down.
At the end, at the 36 min mark is a quick 4 minute long teaching of the steps, only 2x each in 3/4 speed (not much slower) & normal speed w/no music in what looks like a living room w/hardwood floors. She only gives you quick cues as she does them, no other explanation.

This is best for those who learn steps easy who don't need a lot of instruction.
