3788135,5,B001T6KW4S,"Where do I begin? Acting - top class. Cinematography - terrific. Story - what can be better than real life stories?
""This is me, this is what I do."" Brian (Mark Ruffalo) to his wife - played by Amanda Peet.
He is a Boston criminal. He doesn't know any better and neither does his friend Paulie (Ethan Hawke). Both have been doing jobs for their boss since they were kids.
Things go quite well at first. Brian makes a living. Nothing special but he and his family are doing all right. Then drugs get in the way and he loses control. A job goes wrong and both Brian and Paulie end up in jail.
There Brian finally realizes what he was throwing away all this time. A loving wife who still holds on to him, two great kids, love.
To me the best moment in the film is a scene after Brian is back home from prison and he talks to his eldest son on the porch. He knows he can't let them down again. If he does he will lose everything he ever had.
So he makes a choice, takes the last chance he's got. To be there for those who love him and not to deceive them again. He is strong and together they will make it.
As I said before, great acting by the entire cast, Mark, Ethan, Amanda, but also the kids, the crime boss (Brian Goodman - also first time director).
I loved Mark in Zodiac, Amanda in Syriana and Ethan in Training Day but here they are even better.
Most of the story takes place during the winter and although it's often sunny they toned down the colors adding a little to the weight of the drama.
The Blu-ray is marvelous. Crisp when needed (not overdone thank God) with the winter sun, yet at the same time tolerating a certain softness which adds to the intimacy and warmth.
Get it.",1242259200,11,1688,4.180981595092025
3788136,3,B001T6KW4S,"This film is yet another rehash of that glut of films about kids who begin lives of crime early on, go to jail, and come out either enlightened or unchanged.  Set in South Boston, WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU happens to star some fine actors in Mark Ruffalo, Ethan Hawke, and Amanda Peet, and their presence makes the film watchable.  It is just tiresome to watch repeats an this 'bad kid' (Ruffalo) turned junkie turned convict turned negligent husband and father turned AA whose ability to make decent decisions finds him clueless until the end of the film.

The flavor of South Boston and prison and petty crimes becoming major crimes is well paced by writer/director/actor Brian Goodman.  But this rambling story is ultimately boring - except for the pleasure of watching Mark Ruffalo inhabit this loser of a character. An OK movie, not a great one. Grady Harp, May 09",1241654400,3,865,4.746666666666667
3788137,4,B001T6KW4S,"""What Doesn't Kill You"" is a drama of substance, and the compelling performances of Mark Ruffalo and Ethan Hawke elevate this above just another formulaic story about two criminals in a working-class neighborhood in South Boston. Ethan Hawke and Mark Ruffalo play best friends  Paulie and Brian, who work for a local crime lord [played by Brian Goodman] , their criminal activities covering extortion of protection money, petty crimes etc.  Paulie is single and lives life to the fullest, whereas Brian is married [to Amanda Peet's character] and has two young sons. The two, in an attempt to make more money come up with a plan to rob drug dealers, and in the process, Brian develops a crack cocaine habit, much to his wife's chagrin.

In the course of a crime, the pair get arrested and land in jail, serving time for 5 years - a time frame that Brian spends regretting his past behavior and determines to change his life for the better. When Brian gets out of prison ahead of Paulie, he attempts to build back his life with his family, but keeps coming up against a hard wall. When Paulie gets out, he  tries to get Brian involved in their old criminal activities again, and Brian faces the conundrum - does he go back to the familiar life of crime which `pays' or does he keep struggling in altering his life, crime-free?
The story may not be highly original, but the movie is well-directed, and the two leads are compelling in their performances. Mark Ruffalo especially, truly flexes his acting chops here, portraying a tortured soul who tries to redeem his past behavior with a new approach to life, but faces one obstacle after another. His acting is wholly credible and I'd say his role carried most of this movie. Ethan Hawke's character does not seem to be focused on as much here, but his Paulie is no less compelling, portraying a different character to that of Brian - Paulie lives only for himself, and is neither repentant nor apologetic about his criminal past.

Brian Goodman makes an impressive directorial debut here and ""What Doesn't Kill You"" rings true from beginning till the end.  Not your typical shoot `em up movie, but more of a slow-paced yet compelling drama that will strike a chord in discerning viewers.",1241308800,3,2236,4.720512820512821
3788138,5,B001T6KW4S,"the review by J. K. Hinton nails it pretty good. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Hawke & Ruffalo are fantastic in their respective roles. These are the kinds of movies I enjoy these days as opposed to the bang bang shoot 'em up movies that are more about special effects than a good storyline. Some of you reading this may even know people like this. I have no problem recommending this movie, and I do. Well done!

3788139,4,B001T6KW4S,"Take equal parts The Wire, The Departed, and other gang/drug related stories, mix, and you end up getting What Doesn't Kill You.  Despite its semi-derivative style though, What Doesn't Kill You is frequently compelling, and features a brilliant performance from Mark Ruffalo.  Ruffalo and Ethan Hawke star as Brian and Paulie respectively; two low- rent hoods for Boston gangster Pat Kelly (writer/director Brian Goodman) who start thinking their efforts are worth more than what they've been getting.  Between Brian's growing drug addiction, his long-suffering wife (Amanda Peet) and kids, and Paulie's idea of hitting an armored car; What Doesn't Kill You presents three desperate characters whose lives have taken sour turns.  While Hawke and Peet are excellent, the film belongs Ruffalo, who gives the best performance of his career.  So good is he that you won't really notice how predictable and fairly by-the-book the film's screenplay is, and you won't really care all too much either.  All in all, What Doesn't Kill You is a worthwhile endeavor for the actors alone, and in that regard alone, it is definitely worth seeing.",1241222400,,1132,5.226519337016574
3788140,4,B001T6KW4S,"Mark Ruffalo (Brian) and Ethan Hawke (Paulie) are childhood friends, growing up on the mean-streets of South Boston.  Early on, they are overtaken by the path of least resistance toward easy money, through the negative environmental influences surrounding them.  They eventually become runners, and, the heavy-hand, for organized crime boss Pat Kelly (Brian Goodman).  Sadly, given their surroundings, it became their destiny---'the apple does not fall far from the tree.'

As the viewer you are able to observe these boys evolve from small time crime, to full-blown, risk-taking, men, with little remorse for social misconduct and an aversion toward authority figures.  Interestingly, Antisocial Personality Disorders only need to have 3, or more, of 7 traits, and these characters portrayed them all---to perfection. You begin to see neither of them as having any socially redeeming value.  Could redemption be possible with such a prognosis?

This film is brilliantly acted, and a textbook portrayal of budding sociopathy and the destruction it creates. If you have interest in dysfunctional personality dynamics, you will really enjoy it.  However, some may not, because this is not a high-action film, or one of those bloody, chop-off-fingers types, with nausea inducing, gratuitous violence. Yes, there are some violent scenes, but this film is more of a character study of Brian and Paulie. One examining consequences of choices, and whether or not redemption can be found---if it's even sought, when there is a rusty moral compass.

Mark Ruffalo is outstanding in this role. The hospital scene, alone, when he is demanding more 'pain medication,' and his subsequent behaviors afterward are textbook, drug-seeking, antisocial. I can vouch for this, first hand, as I have been on the receiving end of such tirades, as a health care professional.

Although left with a message of hope for one of the primary characters, the problem I had with this film, was the inability to have much empathy for any of them. Even for Ruffalo's wife, who functioned  as an enabler; a wounded personality, herself. But, I don't think we were meant to have empathy---perhaps just a better understanding of how some criminals and addicts amongst us are created, with a little window into their mind.

Brian and Paulie's story did touch a nerve for me, that we need more intervention, better schools and community outreach in neighborhoods such as these---that we as a society keep dropping the ball. When every child isn't given more opportunities to roll out from under that apple tree, we ALL suffer the negative consequences.",1241222400,5,2614,5.242206235011991
3788141,4,B001T6KW4S,"From the very first time I saw Mark Ruffalo act until the time I saw this film, I had always thought of him to be a below-par actor with limited acting talent who tries to be cute in every film he does. But in this particular film, he surprised me. He plays the very complicated character of Brian almost flawlessly. His best film by some distance. One good thing about the film is the background music, it helps give the film a solid undertone. Fans of the great ""Road to perdition"" will like this film. What Doesn't Kill You - will leave the eager and the bored fan alike slightly mesmerized. Ethan Hawke shifts gears and did a great job as the supporting actor playing the energetic Paulie. A confusing title of sorts, this film is well worth a watch.",1240531200,6,754,4.392857142857143
3788142,4,B001T6KW4S,"I was pleasantly surprised in seeing this excellent minimalist crime drama by first-time writer/director (and former jail occupant) Brian Goodman. For as little as the Blu format gets tested with this film though, I still appreciated the landscapes being preserved in 1080 to give this a decent rating.

The story centers on two childhood friends in South Boston and their 20+ year span of semi-organized crime, drugs and family life. Ethan Hawke and Mark Ruffalo both give outstanding performances with all of their usual nuances, and even a few new ones; Hawke's voice and demeanor has changed significantly of late. The trailer shows most of the action in the film, but just expect a well crafted dialogue and bleak visuals story about crime, addiction and loss.

The outer channels get used very little except for two or three gun scenes, and the picture clarity was all about seeing Boston in winter. There were actually no colors in the entire film except for one scene in the jail (bright yellow fencing). This would be more of a display test for your whites, blacks and silver hues. The supplements contain some standard deleted scenes, a typical ""everyone is awesome"" behind the scenes and a commentary with also first-time writer Donnie Wahlberg (has a small supporting role).

Not a technically outstanding Blu, but a worthy owner for fans of the actors, even for the Amanda Peet followers, she showed the best I have seen in her since she started.",1240531200,3,1459,4.9227642276422765

3788162,4,B001T6KW4S,"The synopsis of this film really turned me off as it read like a seen it all and heard it all before type tale. Based in South Boston, we meet Brain and Paulie played by Mark Ruffalo and Ethan Hawke. They are from the wrong side of the tracks and after a life of crime and being busted Paulie thinks that one more heist might be his way out of the ghetto. So sounds a bit like dj vu? Well I was completely wrong.

These guys and their extended friends and families come across as completely believable and what is more important is that these are not the Mr Big gangsters. They are really the foot soldiers for the higher ups and only get the crumbs from the table. They see the greed of those who they work for whilst they struggle to meet bills etc. Ok so perhaps they should just get a job or have studied harder at school. Well we don't all get the same chance in life and so walk a mile in their shoes etc before being the first to cast a stone (sorry mixed metaphors there).

This is all done in such a way that you end up caring for all the players and I was hooked until the end. This is based on true stories of the men involved and makes it more poignant for it. There are scenes of violence, drug taking and the usual language that you would expect from hoodlums.  Great performances all round and once you get past the worry of lack of originality you will find a rather good film waiting to get out.",1382140800,,1412,4.108695652173913

3788164,3,B001T6KW4S,"Ethan Hawke already made a movie somewhat like this before; it was called ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.""  And that film has Marissa Tomei (and of course Philip Seymour Hoffman), which automatically means that the other film was probably going to be better.  And it surely was.

The biggest issue with this film:  there seems to be not a single sympathetic character here, at least until the end.  Amanda Peet?  Meh.  She comes across as somewhat of a whiner, even though she has all the reason in the world to whine.  Mr. Hawke?  He never redeems himself.  I surely wouldn't want to be his friend.  And Mark Ruffalo?  Well, you'll have to find out by watching if he ever has any redeeming qualities.  But a movie needs someone that you can root for if you want to stay interested, and while I wanted to find that someone, that person arrived way too late.

I thought about the film ""Good Will Hunting"" while watching this, not because they were totally similar -- there are some similar themes, however, such as people with issues trying to find their way in the world -- but rather because it was filmed in Boston.  And I believe they call the people in this particular area ""Southies,"" or those that live in South Boston, some of the toughest people around.  They're mean just to be mean, at least from the films that I've seen.  After watching a couple of movies shot in this neighborhood, I surely never want to even visit.  Heck, I wouldn't even want to drive through.

But there's potentially even another bigger issue here.  I found that there were just too many things going on for me.  I think that the plot could have been tightened up a bit to reduce the number of plot elements going on, and that would have maybe been better.  I don't want to give away any of those plot elements since that could potentially be a spoiler, however.

I really wanted to like this film, in particular since Mr. Ruffalo is in it.  He was terrific in ""Zodiac,"" he was excellent as ""The Hulk.""  But even he couldn't quite save this film.  Even still, I will give it a very minor recommendation.  But if you haven't seen ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,"" queue that one up instead.",1363824000,,2182,4.5
3788165,5,B001T6KW4S,"I love this movie because it's a great success story written by Brian Goodman - a former strong arm guy that alledgedly worked for the Irish Mafia in South Boston.  The crime scenes are probably fictional but similar examples of his real life crime story. Mark Ruffalo did an excellent job playing Brian Goodman in this story while Brian plays the part of the crime boss that he worked for (Whitey Bulger?).  Brian is one of the few tough guys that could scare most people he met in the streets - including some cops.  That's probably why Donnie Wahlberg played the part of the fearless detective that kept an eye on him like a good tough angel trying to help Brian keep straight and ready to lock him up if he messed up.

Brian Goodman is a great power of example to guys like me that grew up on the streets that were often homeless as teens. Many ended up doing time in jail, a house of correction or prison.  Brian walked away from that life and became a very good actor - becoming one of many Southie success stories that started out in extreme hardship.

Brian - if you ever read this I want you to know I've become a big fan of your work.  I got a kick out of the sucker punch Ruffalo gave the off-duty detective (Donnie Wahlberg) in this movie - it reminded me of something you said to me on the phone back in the 90's when you called the District 6 and yelled at me for knocking on the door in the high-rise many years ago while looking to talk to you about a legal process. You might remember that I laughed at that and never held it against you - because I grew up like you and didn't fear anyone either.  Many of the words we spoke in real life were repeated between Ruffalo and Wahlberg in the movie - leading me to wonder if I had the honor of another great Dorchester guy (Donnie Wahlberg) to play my part in your movie.  In the movie Ruffalo and Walberg had a talk - and that was probably the first time your character realized that cop was looking out for you and your family just like he did for many others in Southie.  Brian, I admire you for your great turn around - you made yourself into an outstanding man worthy of my respect.  Congrats!

Sgt A.

PS: Please tell Donnie Wahlberg he's a great tv cop and that if he was portraying me that he did a great job.  Please tell him that I suggest he take up Ju Jitsu - and use that in his movies instead of punching everyone.  You can easily deliver more pain and compliance without any blood.

PS2: I Got a kick out of my name being used for the corrupt male judge that wore bra and panties in your 3rd episode of Rizzoli and Isles last year.  If you ever run out of ideas for that show - contact me...",1362355200,,2669,4.16147859922179
3788166,3,B001T6KW4S,"This was a pretty intense movie, but it felt as though as I watching it in fast forward. What Doesn't Kill You is the story of two brothers, who grow up in poverty and whom turned to organized crime to survive. For fifteen years, they did what they were told, but with the boss on his way to prison, they decide to go off on their own. Admittedly, it's a tremendous story that follows the paths of these brothers over  the course of the next few years, the problem was that in this movie, years translate into about 10 minute intervals. Instead of giving us a complete and accurate portrayal, the director decided to cut the story into small fragments, usually no longer than a minute or two. Something is said, something happens, and then were on to another something, when? where? who knows!? The movie moved so fast and was so choppy, that it left my head spinning. Despite the confusion, it was pretty entertaining and Mark Ruffalo gives an unbelievable performance. Here's another example of a guy I've seen around, never thought much of, who randomly shows up in a B-movie and just makes the whole film worth watching. If you're able to keep up, and this movie doesn't confuse you into an absolute stupor, it's not bad. The story is solid, the cast is good, and it has it's moments, but again only if you can get passed the ridiculous pace the director has decided to set for us.",1361491200,,1385,4.496031746031746

3788169,2,B001T6KW4S,"I really disliked WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU.  It's a thoroughly generic ""gritty crime drama"" that has not one original moment and not one single character to root for or even find any originality in.  The only thing preventing this from being a one-star film are the authentic Boston locations and the fact that Mark Ruffalo and Amanda Peet are in it.  Their talents are wasted...but I just like both these actors.

Ruffalo and his good friend Ethan Hawke have been petty crime thugs in the lower middle class neighborhood since they were kids.  Doing little ""errands"" as kids led them to a life of doing slightly bigger, more dangerous errands...but it's all quite petty.  Robbing delivery trucks seems to be their big thing...usually by first paying off the driver so that there's no risk of gunplay.  They make little money, and Ruffalo, who is married to Peet and has two small children, becomes more and more anxious.  Hawke is single and more volatile, but Ruffalo is more tortured, and thus turns to drugs for comfort.

You can predict almost every development of this movie.  They try to strike out on their own.  They get arrested.  Ruffalo's marriage is full of fights.  The urge to go straights butts up against the realities of trying to make a decent living.  The film is populated with one clichd character after another.  Ruffalo is the troubled guy who has a decent core.  Hawke the dangerous loose cannon (yes, think Affleck & Renner in THE TOWN).  Peet is the wife who stays for no good reason.  The one troubled kid who pushes dad away.  The older petty-crime boss who works out of a bar.  The veteran cop keeping an eye on things.  The older ex-con who serves as an AA sponsor.  It just goes on and on.

As does the movie...it drags to a silly conclusion.  The movie begins with an armored car heist going wrong, but before we see the whole fallout, we jump back to the beginning.  Yet when we get back to the big heist, it's a big letdown.  There is virtually no other action in the movie.  It's all moping around in bad weather.

Poor Amanda Peet has the worst of it.  We get NO sense of her character...she's either yelling at Ruffalo or bedding him, or giving him meaningful looks.  We have no idea why she's with him or why she stays.  Hawke gives a very generic performance...it's the grimy Hawke of so many other movies like BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD.  Ruffalo, who is such a charismatic and easy performer, flounders here with an under-written role that gives his character no real room for development.  The character changes, true, but it's all arbitrary.

I blame it on the script by actors Brian Goodman and Donnie Wahlberg, who also appear in the film.  All they are doing is rehashing far better crime movies.  And I wouldn't even mind a predictable rehash so much if there was any pace, any character to grip me or any thread of plot that lasts more than two or three scenes.  The movie is episodic and lazy.

I guess watching the movie didn't kill me, but it sure didn't make me stronger.  Avoid!",1332633600,,3037,4.564007421150278

3788172,5,B001T6KW4S,"This film is a compelling story of human life and values.  Everything about it is authentic, from the South Boston neighborhoods to the fine actors Mark Ruffalo, Ethan Hawke, and Amanda Peet.  It is based on a true-life story of director Brian Goodman.  The first half of the movie shows how two childhood best friends get caught up in a life of crime, at first petty and then more serious.  The second half of the movie, where it really shines, offers the chance of redemption.  What often is a formulaic downward spiral into crime becomes something else -- a character study that is as real as any in any movie.

This struggle is powerfully portrayed by Mark Ruffalo in a role that is impressively authentic, real, and natural.  Seeing it a second time you begion to notice the dozens of small facial and eye movements through which Ruffalo shows the conflicts and struggles in his character.  He should have been nominated for an Oscar if it were not for the flop of the distribution company which resulted in very few seeing the movie when it was finally released in a few theatres at the end of 2008.

""What Doesn't Kill You"" is shot beautifully by Brian Goodman who makes an impressive directorial debut.  He also gives an excellent performance as Pat the crime boss.  There are many short and memorable scenes which are cut to the bare bones with nothing to bore the viewer.  There is a wonderful musical score featuring violins, especially at the end of the movie.  At its core this movie is compelling drama that will leave a deep impression in discerning viewers.",1316995200,,1573,4.655797101449275
3788173,3,B001T6KW4S,"""Southie"" Boston must be some kind of a place. It seems all the movies set there are crime dramas. ""What Doesn't Kill You"" is that for sure, but with a slight twist.

Here's the scoop. We meet Brian and Paulie (Ruffalo and Hawke respectively) as young boys when they start doing odd jobs for the local hood. You jump ahead 15 years and they're pretty much still doing the same thing. But now, Ruffalo is in a failing marriage and Hawke just chases women. They're petty thieves who feel as though they're spinning their wheels. They try to branch out on their own but that's a no-no with their superiors. They end up in prison for five years on a failed robbery, and this is where the story shifts gears. Now the movie switches to the Ruffalo character and his struggles to break the chain.

Other than the hard right turn in the story, this isn't really different than other movies set in ""Southie."" The petty thieves, petty crime, 'watch who you cross' mentality has been done a number of times before. Sometimes better, sometimes worse but it's old. So here, the switch-up in the story comes as a surprise and a bit of a relief. Ruffalo is the product of his environment and there's little to like in him. So when you see him actually try to get out of the vicious cycle he's in, you start to like him and gain some respect for him. And as this is reportedly a true story, it brings the viewer's involvement up a few notches. For some, this might break the movie. If you're looking for a full-out crime movie, you might lose interest. If you accept the story shift you might enjoy it. Unfortunately, Ruffalo's trials on the road to recovery take a comparatively short amount of time given the length of the movie. The producers/ director could have detailed this a bit better, but it's still a nice respite from the well worn crime drama trail.

The acting and all the production values are very good, and I really liked the musical score. It stuck out, but in a good way.

This movie isn't great by any means but I didn't feel as though I was wasting my time watching it. If you're prone to this sort of thing then have at it and enjoy.",1298246400,,2139,4.393939393939394

The part of the movie about his partner getting hooked on crack and loosing everything is a good point, that seem's to happen to too many soul's out there in life. Hopefully the movie can make a difference in someone's life. All and all I liked the flick I would recommend buying and watching it, but that's just me!",1288310400,,493,4.406593406593407
3788175,4,B001T6KW4S,"An armored car is robbed by three men. A passing police officer and one of the robbers exchange fire. The robber is Paulie. In a flashback we follow him and his closest friend, Brian, as they grow up together in South Boston. They're tough guys, thugs, doing jobs for the local boss and chaffing to do more. Paulie's the leader. Brian drinks too much and free bases, ignoring his wife and two young boys. Life-changing events lead him to try to go straight, look for work, take what comes his way, and go to A.A. meetings. He struggles. Paulie shows him the plans for the armored car job. I was expecting this movie to be another predictable action movie, well it's not. The acting, writing, editing, and the music score, all made a very good contribution to this movie.  Mark and Ethan's stunning performance elevates the movie from a standard gritty fare into an emotional, brutal, bitter realism. Definitely worth a look.",1268697600,,924,4.703703703703703
3788176,2,B001T6KW4S,"The unfulfilled implication of the title--""... makes you stronger""-- is that this is a drama about the growth of the main character Brian (Ruffalo) through dealing with adversity.  Brian and the other lead character Paulie (Hawke) are uninteresting losers, on the bottom rung of a gang with no indication of ever becoming anything more or different.  Even their aspirations are trivial and uninteresting.  Because I couldn't get involved in their stories, I couldn't get interested in, much less care about, what happened to them.

What's left is a disjointed collection of scenes primarily of their thuggery.  I could imagine many of the scenes individually being a component of a good movie--and typically they have been part of much better movies--but here they add up to nothing.

A measure of how uninvolving this movie was is that I found myself easily distracted by the cinematography, ignoring the characters and story.  I kept watching only because the images of Boston in winter were so evocative (I went to college there).

Amanda Peet is disconcertingly miscast in this movie. She shines through every scene she is in, grabbing your attention and making you care about her character and her character's circumstances.  Normally this would be good, but here it emphasizes how bland and uninvolving the male characters are.  The script provides no hint of why such a woman would have married Brian, much less stayed married to him.",1263686400,2,1441,5.093617021276596

as people? They are out beating up and robbing people from the time they are kids.
That they could have a family life on the other side of robbing and doing cocaine
makes them human?
I thought that the movie about modern mobsters in the big city
was just pretty nasty instead of the exciting it was supposed to be.
Aside from having a really bad plot, the acting , costumes and setting was well done.

3788182,4,B001T6KW4S,"""What Doesn't Kill You""  reminded me of such episodic gangster pictures as ""Goodfellas"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America.""  It's an autobiographical take on the life and experiences of director Brian Goodman, who was a petty criminal and drug addict as well as a family man.  From an early age, Brian (Mark Ruffalo) and Paulie (Ethan Hawke) do jobs for crime boss Pat Kelly.  With no way to support a growing family, Brian sinks deeper and deeper into the world of crime until he is given the opportunity to participate in the biggest robbery of his life.
 The film's Boston setting is reminiscent of ""The Departed,"" but Goodman's film is far more modest and less complex.  The best thing about ""What Doesn't Kill You"" is Mark Ruffalo, who has done consistently good work in excellent, mediocre, and weak films through the years.  Here, he has a meaty role and makes Brian a multifaceted character, not a one-note clich&eacute;.  His Brian is torn between the dishonest world of fast bucks and his responsibility to a wife and child.  The film is raw and captures the desperation of the streets.  Considering it doesn't boast A-list stars, a top director, or large budget, the film is an admirable achievement.
Bonus extras include deleted scenes, commentary, and a making-of featurette.",1243036800,2,1287,4.889400921658986
