7830620,5,630275447X,"I liked the original, but I thought the 1991 version was by far better, better acting, better budget, better visual quality ( i.e. the t.v. screen didn't get fuzzy or blurry like on the original series ), so that's my 2 cents, thanks 4 reading my review.",970963200,,254,4.425531914893617
7830621,5,630275447X,"The 1991 series of Dark Shadows that aired on NBC was a saving grace for me!  As a 7 year old girl I stayed up late every Friday night and got lost in the world of Barnabas and Angelique and Josette.  My mother grew up on  the original show and I've seen many episodes of that as well, but in my  opinion it doesn't hold a candle to the revival series.  The actors in the  1991 series show such passion and soul in everything they do!  Definitely  see this series!  Believe me, it's worth it!  I own every episode on video!",955670400,,523,4.089108910891089
7830622,5,630275447X,"I thought this was an excellent movie.  CBS, i think brought dark shadows back to life by making it into a tv mini-series.  I loved it so much, that now i'm going to buy the whole series.  Ben Cross did an excellent job of  playing Barnabus, as did Joann Going on her part.  If you were a fan of  the old dark shadows, as my mom is, my advice for you is to buy this.  Don't count on it being in any stores either - already tried that, and most  places don't carry this series anymore.",952732800,2,484,3.96875
