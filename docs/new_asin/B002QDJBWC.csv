8377695,3,B002QDJBWC,"If you are an avid filmgoer, and are looking for something unconventional, you may try Dieta mediterrnea, a Spanish romantic comedy about two males and one female. I am not saying that you will enjoy watching the film and its characters  Im afraid that some would find them shallow  while it is true that Barcelona-born director Joaqun Oristrell is attempting to do something different.

The story revolves around Sofa (Olivia Molina), daughter of parents who run a seaside restraint in Spain, who grows up to become a renowned chef. But the romantic comedy is not about her cooking and career, as it focuses her complicated relationships with two childhood friends, serious-minded Toni (Paco Len) and womanizing Frank (Alfonso Bassave).

Dieta mediterrnea is not about the heroine choosing either of them. The story boils down to whether or not she should love Toni and Frank at the same time. These males in a way represent a classic choice of stability (or home) vs adventure (or career), and Sofa intends to have both. Will she succeed? But do you really care?

The story that spans more than three decades is certainly unpredictable, but whether you are really interested in it depends on how you view these main characters, especially two males which are at best one-dimensional. Perhaps we should not take the light-hearted (or superficial) romantic comedy too seriously, even though there is one interesting idea somewhere in it.",1391644800,,1437,5.046413502109704

8377697,5,B002QDJBWC,"This movie is absolutely divine!  The plot is brilliant, the characters draw you, and your passions are flared up!

The movie follows a somewhat similar plot than Vicky Kristina Barcelona.  The first obvious difference is that we have two men vying for the attention of a beautiful woman.  There are no crazies, though there is some sort of mental instability.

The character build up is complete and you're drawn to see in a kinder light things that most of us would not experience, though we may want to.  The characters take you from euphoria to concern to ire and then back to euphoria.

Each actor has his/her own beauty.  Olivia Molina develops a character that has an air of innocence and vivaciousness.  She exudes an unintentional sexual energy that draws you to her.

Paco Leon does pretty much the same as Ms. Molina.  He is a handsome man, to say the least, that draws you with his passionate adherence to the woman he loves, and his willingness to maintain her at all costs.

Alfonso Bassave plays a role that in other movies would make him the villain.  Here he flows his way through the plot with genuine desire and heart-wrenching love.

Besides this emotional rollercoaster there's also a wonderful story about food and the desire to excel in this volatile industry.  The magic of the kitchen is a perfect centerpiece for love and lust.

I can't wait until the Region 1 DVD is available!",1350777600,,1404,4.692622950819672
