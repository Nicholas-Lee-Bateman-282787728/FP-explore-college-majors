8595815,5,B00DPF5HX2,"This DVD/Blu-Ray is Caro Emerald performing in London at the legendary Art Deco BBC Radio Theater. The setting was intimate and the band was pitch perfect. Caro enjoyed singing each song, introducing the band members, and interacting with the audience. The bonus features the rehearsal of a couple of songs and a BBC interview--where she tells how she became a singer.

If you have not seen her in concert, this album is worth the cost. You will feel that you are in the audience. Beware, you might enjoy it so much, you might start looking for her albums for your collection.",1412553600,,576,4.702970297029703
