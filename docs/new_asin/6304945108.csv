I thought this video would be more about the man himself, but I still enjoyed the recommended tours & cities to visit. Wish I'd bought this before my vacation to Va. in October!  Great buy for the REL fan!",1453075200,,330,4.32258064516129

7879930,5,6304945108,"Bill Boggs hosts the Historic Traveler Great Destinations series, which takes the viewer to the world's great historic destinations and tries to give a personal sense of the people and events that made history.  In ""Robert E. Lee Country"" Boggs follows the footsteps of the beloved Confederate general, from Richmond to Harpers Ferry, to the Civil War battlefields of Antietam and Gettysburg, to Appomattox Court House and Washington & Lee University.  Boggs not only provides a video tour of these locations, he also gives you very helpful tips about routes and lodgings, as well as telling some stories about what they places are important.  Clearly, this 50-minute videotape is not a substitute for such a trip, but rather an extremely helpful preparation guide for a trip of your own.  Most of these locations are in northern Virginia and the surrounding environs and would make a wonderful three-day excursion for any Civil War buff.  If you are not planning such a trip soon, you will certainly be thinking of one after Bill Boggs whets your appetite for such a trip into history.",1010880000,3,1086,4.9779005524861875
