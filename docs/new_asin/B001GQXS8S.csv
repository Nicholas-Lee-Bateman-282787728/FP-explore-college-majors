8306765,4,B001GQXS8S,"What I mean to say by this title, is that even though the original band is not all there the music is still good, not great but good. Great would be for Mark Stein to be on vocals and Hammond Organ. To me as an original fan, when I think of Vanilla Fudge, I first think of those strong powerful lead vocals by Mark Stein,then the abstract harmony of Tim Bogart. When it comes to the music Stein's Hammond glisses and Bogart's staccato bass lines bottomed out by Carmine Appice's thunderous drums that was the VF sound it left room for guitarist Vinnie Martell's tasteful minimalist style. And it worked! ! !
  On this DVD my attitude is that something is better than nothing, and I don't mean to take anything away from Carmine and Tim, they stand tall and play as strong as ever.
  Guitar player Teddy Rondinelli, is strong and probably a little bit better than Vinnie was 40 years ago, but I don't feel that Teddy captured the ""feel"" necessary to make these songs sound as they did. sometimes better isn't always best. On keyboards, Bill Pascali does a decent job and with his vocals, he covers for Mark Stein. The problem ,to me, is that just covering does not really do the band or the fans justice. I repeat this is better than not having anything at all. but it is like going to a ""Broadway Show"" and having the ""star"" sick and having to watch an understudy, the songs are there, the words are there, but the ""feel"" is not. This is like seeing a really great ""tribute band"". It definately is worth the money and should not disappoint.",1250380800,3,1540,4.411971830985915
8306766,3,B001GQXS8S,"I have been a long time Vanilla Fudge fan. On this DVD, this reincarnation of ""The Fudge"" is incredibly tight even after all these years. All the classics are here. The disappointing aspect of the show are the orchestral arrangements. They are way to busy and hokey for my liking and definitely detract from the overall performance. A good example of orchestral arrangements that work is the Styx and the Contemporary Youth Orchestra of Cleveland concert. Here everything meshed fantastically. Still if you like The Vanilla Fudge this DVD is an interesting experience. The tunes do bring back some good memories of some good times.",1240012800,4,631,5.019047619047619
