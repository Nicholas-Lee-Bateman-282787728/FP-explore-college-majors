8739680,5,B017LJGAQA,I am very pleased with Suzanne Andrew's CD's.  She is easy to follow and I find her methods very energizing and helpful.,1489363200,,120,4.454545454545454
8739681,5,B017LJGAQA,I bought this 3 weeks ago and am amazed at how it's working! i've been doing it regularly - because I just can't stand having to go all the time and leaking. i I finally slept all night without having to get up to go. I sneezed yesterday and I was dry.  saves me money on pads now. I really like Suzanne Andrews DVDs and am glad to add this to my collection.,1486771200,,358,3.904109589041096
8739682,4,B017LJGAQA,"The program is deceptively simple. I've been using it on and off since I got it, not the thirty days recommended, so I guess I can't get the full impact. I will review again after I've done it as recommended.",1485734400,,208,4.225
8739683,5,B017LJGAQA,"Interesting method.  Love that the CD comes with the resistance band, too.",1482969600,,74,5.166666666666667
8739684,5,B017LJGAQA,I bought this DVD in the nick of time.! This DVD has the best pelvic floor exercises ones that I can do at home instead of the gym. It has really helped me get back my muscle tone. Suzanne Andrews makes DVD's that boomers like myself can do and get great results. I have have learned so much from her DVD's because she is in the medical field not some celebrity that jumps up and down shouts at you to get fit. So glad I have found this DVD!,1478044800,4,441,3.966292134831461
8739685,1,B017LJGAQA,The DVD won't place properly. It freezes and skips. I can't use it.,1476835200,,67,4.230769230769231
8739686,5,B017LJGAQA,Wow!  This is exactly and I mean exactly what I needed. Had borrowed a friends copy so I was familiar with the exercises and have found them sooooo doable!  So I realised I just had to get my own copy. At 61 and post menopause I felt everything going south.  I would recommend anyone get this before that happens.  The exercises are easy and well explained and I love the gentle mood music and the timer displayed.  I also appreciated the bedtime exercises which I am doing before I go to sleep.  I know this is helping because I can actually feel it working.  Will keep you updated with my results after a couple of months.  Thankyou so much Suzanne Andrews for creating this!,1473724800,9,677,4.403225806451613
8739687,5,B017LJGAQA,"I have not ordered this dvd yet. The company I called them to see if they could make a video concerning pelvic floor prolapse. WOW, what an experience. This company truly cares about the customers. In fact, after I called, a really nice man from the company called and offered to help me. There are not many companies around like this today, and when You find a company that goes out of their way to serve You--like they did, well, I just had to write this review, and give the company-- A 5 star review!!!!! I have all of Suzanne Andrews Dvd's, they are Dvd's that You can do in Your own home, usually with equipment or materials one already has.

  My only wish is that Suzanne Andrews & Co. would make more dvd's in regards to walking, like a one mile, two mile, three mile, and so on, all with scenery in the background, in places like quaint New England towns like Salem and Marblehead, Concord, and Cambridge, Massachusetts--or towns like Atlantic City, --the boardwalk, or Washington State--would be beautiful--In the walking dvds, Suzanne would be walking, maybe with walking poles or weights. What an adventure! And Suzanne, could have a couple women who are trying to shed some weight or a lot of weight, they would exercise with her in all subsequent videos, beginning with the one mile--all the way to the 5 mile, to the end--possibly a jogging dvd, and as each video progresses from 1-mile to 5mile, to the jogging dvd, she would show the progress of their weight loss-- incentive to a lot of women-- as to what can happen, when they stay motivated--And Suzanne Andrews does  just this !!!!!!!

  What a great Company, Kudos to Suzanne Andrews for presenting ""Us"" and for giving ""Us the opportunity to really get physically fit, no matter what size Your size is. And to add, to All the other pluses--What A Fun Way, To Get Fit And  Be Healthy, And Happy!",1451520000,6,1867,4.585585585585585
