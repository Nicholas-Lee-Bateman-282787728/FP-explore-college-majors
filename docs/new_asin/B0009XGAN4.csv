8069514,4,B0009XGAN4,"Shoji Tabuchi is an incredibly successful performer who owns his own theater in Branson, Missouri, where Shoji and country and western stars stage their shows to sell-out crowds, in a town that has become known as ""the live country music capital of the world."" A classically trained violinist since childhood, Shoji plays everything from the ""Milk Cow Blues"" to Mozart. The selections are played in medleys: There is a Bob Wills medley, a Latin music medley, a waltz, polka, and pop medley, and a Mozart medley.  The show is a Las Vegas-Nashville-Tokyo hybrid that entertains as it amazes with its almost bizarre singularity. One thing is for certain, there is no other person in the music business quite like Shoji.

Shoji was born in Japan, and moved to the US about 25 years ago. He sings and speaks in a charming, halting, and heavily accented English, and jokes that country star Mel Tillis is his English teacher. Tall and slender, with a bowl haircut and a sparkling sequined jacket, his show is the kind that music snobs would call ""corny,"" and the rest of us would call fun. Produced by his pretty wife Dorothy (we catch a glimpse of her at the end of the show), Shoji is a versatile showman and deserves his title as ""The King of Branson, Missouri."" Total running time is 50 minutes.",1122768000,3,1293,4.691629955947136
