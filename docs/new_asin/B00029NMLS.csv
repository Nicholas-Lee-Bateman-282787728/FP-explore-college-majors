8024603,5,B00029NMLS,"Dunbine is a great cross genre Mecha show, mixing Gundam with Lodoss War. Also reminiscent of  magitek mecha from Final Fantasy VI. As far as length Dunbine is a longer show (But nowhere near the longest) and with a longer show of course there is some build up, Vol. 7 is the begining of the second half so it's full trottle from here on out. I jusyt wish it were more available. the available ending Volumns get up there in price to the point of which no one is going to buy them. It's really a shame that ADV Films went under. They had som many awesome titles under their belt and a lot of them haven't been rereleased since so they are few and far between. A few titles here and there have been picked up by other companies but not enough. But if you can find it at a reasonable price and you like Robotech, Gundam, Final Fantasy or ...you know what it kinda reminds me of Game of Thrones with Mecha...sweet anyway check out Aura Battler Dunbine out.",1398816000,,953,4.265193370165746
