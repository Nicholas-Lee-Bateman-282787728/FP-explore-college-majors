8056498,5,B00091RU62,I love Grace Jones. Insane videos and over the top.,1415232000,,51,4.2
8056499,5,B00091RU62,This video is the same as her One Man Show video. It is just a re-release that is repackaged with new cover art on the box and her Slave to the Rhythm video added to the compilation. Those two reasons were enough for me to buy this video. I grew up watching her Slave to the Rhythm video and seeing it again brought back memories. The stunning images created by Jean-Paul Goude are amazing. His imagery of Grace is also all over the box that the video is in. What a work of art!,1139011200,11,478,4.095744680851064
8056500,5,B00091RU62,"I saw this about two decades ago at the age of 11 or so.  It's only now that I realize how revolutionary it was.  Europeans have always recognized Grace, but we Americans need to jump on this important bandwagon quick.  The videos here are abstract and provocative.  Clearly, Grace has been an influence on Jody Watley, Annie Lennox (once referred to by the press as ""the white Grace Jones""), and many other chanteuses.  That low, androgynous voice is sexy and soothing and these videos only underscore what a fascinating and meritorious DIVA! Grace is.  Work, Miss Girl!  SNAP!!!!",1125705600,14,581,4.86734693877551
