6460928,4,B00L1WJEIK,Decent movie,1424390400,,12,5.5
6460929,5,B00L1WJEIK,"Not bad at all I think it was well done excellent special effects actors are eh okay. Kate is the mother of a boy possessed by a powerful demon who during his possession went on a serial killing spree and was executed by lethal injection just before his execution the demon leaves his body. Kate is obsessed with proving both her son was innocent and the demon inside him used his body to commit the murders and the existence of the devil

She hires a film crew to document the moronic thing she is about to do summon a demon to become possessed despite the warnings from the same priest who performed an exorcism on her son she proceeds with her plan. She sets up the things needed to bring the demon to her symbols written in blood candles etc and he comes. However things do not go entirely her way and the unforeseen events that unfold take a tragic turn for the worse, at the end I said WTF? That is a damned shocking chart topper I never saw that coming nor was I expecting it excellent plot twist ending",1424304000,9,1010,4.287958115183246
6460930,4,B00L1WJEIK,"Got this movie because the cover looked cool. The movie is basically a ""found footage"" about Kate Winters whose son killed a bunch of people. In order to prove that he was actually innocent because he was possessed at the time of the killings, she summons a demon to possess her. I'm probably not spoiling anything here...but she does succeed. The rest of the movie is about her possession.

IMO the idea of someone wanting to become possessed is unique from other similar movies out there. It was pretty suspenseful with good scares here and there. Overall not the best movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth a watch.",1423872000,7,627,4.7
6460931,1,B00L1WJEIK,"Terrible, stereotypical c-horror microbudget, found footage video. Lame and cheesy acting, ridiculous makeup, uninspired dialogue, and a plot cut-and-pasted from the long list of ""exorcism/possession"" films we've all seen a hundred times before. I watched this one all the way through, just to ensure a fair review, but unfortunately, it's just another clunker.

I really wanted to like this, as I'm a huge fan of the found footage and of demonic/supernatural genres. Still, it's just another one to throw on the ever-growing pile of weekend-shoot, microbudget found footage videos.

Wait for it to come out on Netflix or Amazon Prime, and save your money for some of the really original, well-acted, creepy horror films that have been released in the last year

If you're looking for a good recent found footage, demonic posession film to replace this, for example, check out ""The Atticus Institute"" instead.",1423872000,14,909,5.255172413793104
6460932,5,B00L1WJEIK,Great story! Great characters! Fun low budget horror!,1423785600,,53,5.75

6460934,1,B00L1WJEIK,"Low budget, clunky, very bad acting. Very very bad. Really not sure where the IMBD rating came from, but most likely the cast. I got through about half of it..",1423785600,3,159,4.333333333333333
6460935,1,B00L1WJEIK,Didn't enjoy it.,1427587200,,16,4.666666666666667
6460936,1,B00L1WJEIK,There is absolutely no way to explain how bad this movie is. I can't even bring myself to type more it was so bad.,1427328000,2,114,3.7916666666666665
6460937,1,B00L1WJEIK,"Should have been warned that it was a C-movie, weekend shoot.  However, it did make us laugh once we got past the annoyance of spending five bucks on it.",1427328000,2,153,4.275862068965517
6460938,2,B00L1WJEIK,Kind of cheesy.,1426809600,,15,4.333333333333333
6460939,1,B00L1WJEIK,Sucked bad movie bad acting,1426377600,,27,4.6
6460940,1,B00L1WJEIK,"An appallingly bad production with amateurish acting. I could watch only ten minutes of it.

I am suspecting that the star rating for this movie has been rigged somehow.",1426118400,,169,4.827586206896552
6460941,1,B00L1WJEIK,The movie was really bad!!!!,1425945600,,28,4.8
6460942,1,B00L1WJEIK,"The trailer fooled me.  Looked decent, but in fact was one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.  Period.  Awful script, ridiculous plot, garbage acting, end a miserably disappointing ending.  Just terrible.  I think one of the people who gave it five stars is actually one of the actors in it.  Not kidding.  Do NOT waste your time, unless you like watching terrible horror movies to make fun of them.  If so, there's some solid opportunities for laughs in this one.  Otherwise do not waste your time.",1425686400,2,509,4.629213483146067
6460943,1,B00L1WJEIK,"Quite possibly the worst acting I've ever seen.
""I really appreciate you- I really appreciate you doing this.""
""I'm really glad you have that camera. No one would believe us if you didn't!""
This school project movie makes you feel embarrassed. It makes you feel utterly insulted as a horror fan. Do not give this film any kind of chance. Unless of course you're having trouble sleeping.",1425513600,3,386,4.776119402985074
6460944,1,B00L1WJEIK,This is some of the worst acting and dialog I've ever seen! Anything over 1  star has to be written by the film makers themselves.,1425427200,3,130,4.2
6460975,5,B00L1WJEIK,Fun film. Good script. Good acting.,1425168000,,35,5.0
6460976,2,B00L1WJEIK,"Great ""found footage"", good story, however ... acting and makeup make the movie disengaging and boring at times. Should be redone with higher budge",1425168000,,147,5.166666666666667
6460977,1,B00L1WJEIK,Just plain silly......,1425081600,,22,6.666666666666667
6460978,5,B00L1WJEIK,I'm a die hard horror fan I liked this movie but  it wasn't all I expected.,1425081600,,75,3.6875
6460979,1,B00L1WJEIK,"Amazon should flag these extremely poor productions somehow.

This is a C-series movie. I mean, really completely, beyond description piece of c**p.

The problem is not the low budget, but the low intellect and the low skill level. Bad, ""wooden language"" script, bad acting, barely sketched, stereotypical characters and poorly executed ""documentary-style"" photography that makes you dizzy with motion for no particular reason at all.

There's a very clear threshold separating a video from a motion picture, and this thing doesn't cut it.",1424995200,6,539,5.469879518072289
6460980,1,B00L1WJEIK,So. Stupid.,1424995200,,11,5.0
6460981,5,B00L1WJEIK,"A good, suspenseful movie to watch with the lights out.",1424822400,,55,4.6
6460982,5,B00L1WJEIK,"I thought the film was great...for what it was.  That it's a B grade movie is not in question, but what they did with what they had?  That was impressive.",1424736000,,154,4.1
6460983,2,B00L1WJEIK,"Pretty mundane.  The acting was stiff and felt forced.  I could almost feel the actors trying but it just didn't come together.  There were some nice effects but ""jump"" scares were a little flat in my opinion.  I gave 2 stars because the concept was a fresh spin on an overdone subject but the rest of the story fell in to the trap of being routine.  I was mildly entertained but felt it needed more.",1424476800,,400,4.28

8663141,5,B00L1WJEIK,Nothing to say but immensely enjoyable.  If like the devil inside or chasing the devil then will like this one too.,1442102400,,115,4.476190476190476
8663142,1,B00L1WJEIK,Underwhelming.,1436918400,,14,14.0

8663144,4,B00L1WJEIK,"Kinda dumb, but interesting take on these tired genres.  Watchable, for sure.",1431561600,2,77,5.416666666666667

8663147,1,B00L1WJEIK,"The script was bad, the acting was worse, and the ""surprise ending"" was a terrible attempt at some meta clean up.
I should have listened to the actual reviews, not the ones done by people involved with the movie. Then I wouldn't have wasted money renting this.",1428019200,,260,4.553191489361702
8663148,3,B00L1WJEIK,"Proof of the Devil was a little lower action than I was expecting, but it is a pretty decent horror movie.  Even though it was a relatively short movie, the build-up is a little bit long at times. By that I mean that I wouldnt have minded if a couple of characters met their doom sooner.

The gist of the story is that a mother hires a documentary film crew to document her own possession in order to clear her familys reputation after her sons murderous rampage. A psychiatrist and his nurse are on board to help add legitimacy and safety.

This wasn't The Exorcist, but I wasn't expecting it to be. Its worth the rent if you're into the genre.",1427760000,2,645,4.31404958677686
