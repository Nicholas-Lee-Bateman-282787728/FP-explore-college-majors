8458420,3,B0055ISAIQ,"I enjoyed both the opera and the production, and all of the signers were more than capable, vocally and dramatically. I'd likely give this a 5-star rating. But the sound is so terrible. It's like when you're watching a live performance and there wasn't a [proper] mic check. Very distracting.",1485475200,,292,4.86
8458421,5,B0055ISAIQ,"A marvelous production, better than what I just saw at the Met.  We New Yorkers think we always get the best there is, but that isn't necessarily so.",1482364800,,149,4.321428571428571
8458422,5,B0055ISAIQ,"A great performance of one of the very greatest of 20th century operas. The singing is very moving from all the  main singers, especially Polaski.  I was impressed with her in Bayreuth 16 years ago when she sang the immolation scene like Bel Canto opera.  Here she is many years later, still at the top of her form.  The conducting is especially good.  Don't miss it. I think it even beats the version with Nina Stemme and Marton and certainly beats the early one from Glyndebourne which has poor sound.  Dec. 22, 2014 I must revise my previous review. After hearing it again I must deduct two stars for terrible balance between the very loud orchestra and the singers.  The orchestra is also very bass heavy.  I must attribute this to poor engineering.",1386979200,,753,4.609022556390977

8458425,5,B0055ISAIQ,"Jenufa is based on a play by Gabriela Preissov, mise en scne in Prague, in November 9, 1890.
 Janacek asked her to put her play to music and began the work of adapting the text and composing the music score in 1894, but the opera was completed only nine years later
The original play was heavily atacked by Prague's conservative stablishment, including on moral grounds. Preissov defended her work, claiming that she had lived in moravian countryside and thus she had a personal acquaintance with this rural, peasant world, adding that she had even taken inspiration of real events happening in the area she had lived, having read about them in the newspapers. During the composition of Jenufa, his daughter, Olga, died. Janacek said tha Jenufa'score ""must be envelopped with the black ribbon of the long maladie and suffering of my daughter Olga and my little son Vladimir"".  First and foremost then,  Jenufa, from the point of view of its libretto, belongs to the same league as Pellas et Mlisande and Salom, that is,  a libretto based on a play, Janacek cut, adapted, but kept much of Preissov's own dialogues.
Musically, this opera is at the very opposite of the neo-romantic movement, illustrated by Mahler and Strauss. Janacek refuses the gigantic orchestra,  the rethoric,  and turns to a concise musical discourse. In a sense, he turns his back to the wagnerian heritage, announcing a musical and dramatic world far removed from myth. His is a world of real human beings, not allegories and symbols and full of, musically, his Moravian background.
As for this DVD, it has much to be appreciated, specially the magnificent singing of Deborah Polaski and a very nice cast, of a very high level, musically and dramatically speaking.",1342828800,,1737,4.931506849315069
8458426,5,B0055ISAIQ,"It's a thrill just to note that there are three DVDs of Leos Janacek's ""Jenufa"", and that all of them have merit. Dare I say that Janacek's ""time has come"" and that his operas now hold the stage alongside Verdi's and Wagner's both in Europe and America? Now there are excellent performances on DVD of:

Janacek owed a lot to Richard Wagner, especially in this early opera Jenufa, first staged in 1904. In fact, a comparison of Jenufa with works by Wagner is almost inevitable, both of the musical structures and of the libretti.  I had considered titling this review something like ""The Best Opera Wagner Couldn't Have Written"" ... but I chickened out. A major point of comparison is that both composers wrote their own librettos, and it's the superiority of Janacek's libretto-writing that most elevates him beyond.

Almost every modern opera -- post-Wagner opera, shall I say? -- is both a theatrical play and an extended vocal/choral symphonic work. There are just a few in which the play and the music are each worthy of the other ... and Leos Janacek wrote five of them. I haven't noticed any reviews or analyses of Jenufa that point out how obviously Janacek must have been influenced by the plays of Henrik Ibsen. The Slavic Connection, to Chekhov, can't be denied, but Jenufa is Ibsenesque in affect and dramaturgy. Filling out some of the dialogue, it would be plausible to perform Jenufa as a play without music; I wonder, in fact, whether anyone has already done so. The acting, therefore, in a staging of the opera ought to be all skillful and convincing as the singing. A fine singer-actor like Anja Silja can drive a performance of Jenufa emotionally, but a miscast actress-singer can dampen the drama painfully; I'm thinking of Silja nd Roberta Alexander in the oldest of the Jenufa DVDs, from Glyndebourne. The actors of this production from Madrid, directed by Stephane Braunschweig, are Ibsen-worthy in every way, with the trivial quibble that Amanda Roocroft could and should have been made-up to look younger in the title role. Nikolai Schukoff plays Steva as a weasly weakling, just as he should. Miroslave Dvorsky gives us a harsh, angry Laca, a ""good"" man who really might win Jenufa's love by his fierce loyalty to her. Roocroft's Jenufa is a foolish girl from whom too much is hoped, still a foolish mother of a scandalous baby, and then a woman plausibly matured by tragedy enough to make a go of her life after all. But the chief character of this drama isn't Jenufa; it's her mother, Kostelnicka, whose actions and decisions impel the course of events. Most Kostelnickas in productions of Jenufa are too simply wicked tyrannical hags. Even Silja's Kostelnicka was too unalleviatedly nasty. In terms of dramaturgy, Deborah Polaski redefines the role of Kostelnicka as a human being with strengths of character that betray her into folly. This Kostelnicka is a woman whom her community would respect, would even venerate for her severe uprightness. That such a woman could be driven by pride, but also by earnest love for her daughter, to commit a horrible crime becomes, as I said, a tragedy worthy of Ibsen.

Polaski matches her performance as an actress by singing Kostelnicka as a powerful but vulnerable woman rather than as a shrieking harridan. Both her physical presence -- her height -- and the richness of her vocal timbres dominate the stage and the music. Without even seeing the cringing Steva, from voices alone and without subtitles, one can hear how she terrifies him. Her maternal dominance of Jenufa, in voice and in manner, is vivid enough to make it convincing that Jenufa would believe her lie that the baby had died. That's a key moment in the play, and this is the only production I've seen in which it's effective.

In the other recent staging of Jenufa, from Barcelona, the role of Laca is sung by Jorma Silvasti. To my ears, Silvasti excels Miroslav Dvorsky vocally -- a more appealing voice and stunningly artful phrasing -- but Dvorsky's characterization of Laca is more effective dramatically and still quite good musically. The edge goes to Ivor Bolton over Peter Schneider as conductor also, for his very effective use of grand pauses, for his sustenance of instrumental intensity without bombast, and for the transparency of the orchestral ensemble in response to his baton. Schneider's interpretation is good, mind you, but Bolton's is a notch better. I could wish, however, that the camera had paid less attention to Bolton's bizarre gyrations during the overtures. He's not a pretty sight to begin with, but here he's ostentatiously ""hamming"" for the camera. No one could possibly follow his flailing baton, so I'm convinced that all the work of interpretation had been finished in rehearsal. Otherwise, the camerawork and the editing are movie-theater proficient, with an artful balance of close-up and full-stage imaging. Since the set is bare-bones simple, this editing needs to be effective, and it is. Jenufa is a tragedy, a dark tormented tale of sexual abandonment, jealousy, and infanticide. But it's not an overblown melodrama like so many tragic operas, and it ends with a survival of human worth.",1326672000,4,6206,5.640256959314775
8458427,5,B0055ISAIQ,"Jenufa is an important opera in respects other than its music and libretto.  Janacek was almost 62 when it received its Prague premiere in 1916.  It was one of five operas written before this great success happened -- the other four are considered part of his maturation and not performed.  But it was this success that inspired him in what has been termed his Indian Summer to write four more operas, a symphonietta, a mass, and a couple of string quartets; and it is on these, as well as Jenufa that his reputation was built, although it took considerable time to reach full flower.

I thought that the Barcelona production with Nina Stemme was wonderful.  I had some reservations about the mise en sc&egrave;ne -- the focus on boulders of different sizes in the three acts (""A stone will crush me.""  ""My sins weigh on me like a stone."") was carrying things a bit too far and to some extent was distracting.  But the singing/acting was done very well indeed -- even, to my surprise, by Eva Marton.  Much as I admire his works, I thought that this would put the cap on my many DVD's of Janacek operas.

However, I very much admired Amanda Roocroft as Fiordiligi in John Eliot Gardner's Cosi Fan Tuti.  When I saw that the production of Jenufa from Madrid had Roocroft playing Jenufa, my curiosity as to how she had matured as a singer/actor, was piqued and I had to have the DVD.  I came out of curiosity about one singer; and finished amazed at how excellent the total production was.

Stefan Westerhoff in his review above was not all that happy with the mise en sc&egrave;ne: ""On the plus side, the minimalist production isn't very distracting either"".  I thought that it excellently supported the production, (but I do agree that the mill wheel was an unnecessary distraction).  Although the props were few, (a rosemary plant in Act I, a crib in Act II, and some church-like benches in Act III), they highlighted the content of each act.  The lighting really should be considered a prop because it added so much by the changes in focus, intensity and colour; and therefore was an enhancement to the action on stage. And there were times when the stage area opened up, such as when Kostelnicka goes out to kill the baby.

St&eacute;phane Braunschweig provided solid and imaginative direction.  The conflicts and emotional crises were made so clear because the principals all seemed to live in their characters.  I would like to mention Nikolai Schukoff first because the character of Steva is usually ignored.  He, in different ways in different situations, well demonstrated the weakness and fecklessness, as well as the attractiveness, of Steva.  Miroslav Dvorsky was a very strong understandable Laca and more than held his own with the two female characters.  Deborah Polaski, tall and imposing, was a wonderful Kostelnicka.  Her voice and demeanor changed with the very different demands on her character in the three acts.  She is always a powerful presence on stage, and so she is here.  But Amanda Roocroft was not outshone by her.  Her Jenufa is always emotionally vulnerable, but strong and accepting when she needed to be -- a very commanding performance.

It goes without saying that the singing is uniformly excellent.  Ivor Bolton does a great job with the orchestra and in addition is responsive to the demands of the action.  I particularly liked the occasions when the music stopped at a time of crisis, and in the silence it was left to the on-stage character to give the cue to start.

As usual, Opus Arte has produced another technologically excellent DVD in terms of the visuals, sound, and balance between the singers and the orchestra.

So, this is another excellent Jenufa, played in Madrid, just down the road from Barcelona where the other excellent Jenufa was played.  For my taste, this is the better of the two.",1318118400,14,3844,4.778787878787878
8458428,5,B0055ISAIQ,"I got this blu-ray a few weeks ago from the UK, since I couldn't wait to watch it.  Ever since I first saw it as a child, I love this opera, and while my favorite Janacek opera is typically the one I have seen most recently, Jenufa has always been special to me...  This new recording from the Teatro Real Madrid is an excellent addition to the Janacek catalog.  While the production isn't as intriguing as Robert Carsen's Katia Kabanova from the same theater, it more than gets the job done, and it gives three excellent singers a chance to shine: Amanda Roocroft as Jenufa, Deborah Polaski as Kostelnicka, and Miroslav Dvorsky as Laca.  Of course, probably to no ones surprise, Polaski pretty much steals the show.  She is not your usual burnt-out soprano using Kostelnicka to prolong a career that has seen better days.  She is still at the top of her game, and her Kostelnicka is not a monster, but rather a complex woman who on the surface is stern and draconic, but also battered by life, making the wrong decisions under pressure.  For once, it seems believable that Jenufa would (sort of) forgive her at the end.  Roocroft is a fine Jenufa.  Some people will probably complain that she is too old to play what is supposed to be a young girl, but I don't see this as a problem, and before the age of opera on dvd, nobody would have noticed anyway.  Her scenes with Polaski in the second act are heart-breaking.  With two singers like this in the main roles, one would almost expect that the male leads don't have much of a chance, but Dvorsky does well in the somewhat unthankful role of Laca.  All three of them get enthusiastic cheers at the curtain calls, but Polaski receives the lion's share.  Polaski and Roocroft hug each other for what seems like almost half a minute during curtain calls - I thought this was a nice gesture, after the tension of Act 3.

The production by Stephane Braunschweig is mostly dark, with a few large walls as the set.  There is not much on stage - a small bed with Jenufa's child in Act 2, a few benches in Act 3.  A lot is done with light - the walls of Kostelnicka's house in Act 2 suddenly open up to let in some icy light just before she takes the child and leaves the house.  At a few places, one wishes the director had tried a little bit harder.  The scenes with the choir could use more care, and the end of Act 1 looses some of its impact because singers don't seem to know where to go or where to look... On the plus side, the minimalist production isn't very distracting either, and has no annoying ""gags.""  Costumes are traditional and simple.  It appears to play in the past, but it could actually play in a traditional rural setting marked by poverty at any time, anywhere - as it should. Twice, at the beginning of Act 1 and the end of Act 2, a huge mill wheel comes out of the floor, and while it is an altogether nice effect, I wish somebody had put some grease on the parts so it would move more smoothly...

Another recent video recording of Jenufa I can compare to is the production from Barcelona with Stemme and Marton.  I like that production and also think that Stemme and Marton are excellent, but in my opinion, this recording from Madrid is superior.  The Barcelona production suffers from sub-par conducting and the very questionable choice of a ""beefed-up"" orchestration of the final scene.  The Madrid production is superbly conducted by Ivor Bolton, and that makes all the difference.  He uses the Mackerras (Brno) edition of the score, which restores the original Janacek orchestration.  Janacek's orchestration is more difficult to pull off (which was of course the reason for the re-orchestration in the first place), but if it is played as well as here, with Bolton leading the Orchestra of the Teatro Real, the performance (especially of the final scene) lacks nothing in brilliance and tension.  Bolton is a bit of a mystery to me.  The camera shows him a few times, and he comes across as somewhat histrionic.  It looks like his movements might be hard to follow.  But the results are outstanding, just as in his recent recording of Haendel's Theodora from Salzburg.",1315008000,26,4147,4.5275167785234895
