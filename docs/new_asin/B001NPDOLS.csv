8327675,5,B001NPDOLS,"It's frustrating!!! Maybe, notice I said ""maybe"" if enough people sign up we'll get some ""action""! Hopefully WB will consider releasing it if they see the countless number of people interested!!! It would be a shame if we're all dead before that happens.",1346025600,11,254,4.930232558139535
8327676,5,B001NPDOLS,"If y'all won't release Bronco on DVD then at least sell the rights or partner with a third party and let them release it! I'm sure Timeless Media would be proud to release Bronco on DVD. I personally think the Warner executives are too Politically Correct and are quite frankly, ashamed of their early western shows. What other reason could they have? We have money and want to buy the DVDs and they reject paying customers! Well, my family rejects the CRAP that the LIBERAL studios are producing today! Thank God we at least have some decent TV shows on DVD and we have Encore Western Channel.",1338076800,13,594,4.5607476635514015

8327678,5,B001NPDOLS,"I'm from the UK and remember these American TV series with great affection, particularly the westerns. Even at this young age I could appreciate the difference in top quality and lack lustre  series. The good ones stood out. As kids we would discuss in depth the next day the programme we saw the night before. Bronco Layne was one of the good ones along with Sugarfoot (Tenderfoot), Laramie, Maverick. A general point, why are we subjected to paltry offerings in the form of best of Season  dvds in colour. I want to see the early episodes in black and white, as I remember and loved them. When some series eventually went to colour this was usually after the series had run for a few years, consequently the ideas/scripts were no longer fresh and were well past their best. So give us complete seasons from day one even if they were in black and white. What executive makes these decisions, are they actually from our era, because they certainly don't appreciate the nostalgia and high regard these series were held in not only now but when they were first shown. Do they not read comments from potential customers. we are also fed up of series being released and then the seasons split up into volume 1 and 2. We all know this is a rip off so most of us will not buy them when presented like this. The execs then wonder why they don't get bought. Get it together and provide the customer with what they want and value for money. And by the way when will one of the best detective series, 77 Sunset Strip be released. Certain series were hugely popular at the time and for good reason, stop releasing rubbish and give the customer what we want.",1269129600,27,1646,4.483333333333333
8327679,5,B001NPDOLS,"yes that is true ...they are sure crazy....why for heaven sake they don't release bronco,cheyenne is beyond my imagination....western far less superior have been released in box sets and bronco doesnt get even one season .Cheyenne which was in the top bracket gets only one .Come one guys we are all going to die one day so please release it cause the next generation aint going to buy it cause they didn't see the magic of Clint and Ty hardin .These were really quality series with a ruggedness about it and we don't get them any more",1267488000,22,535,4.525773195876289
8327680,5,B001NPDOLS,"This studio has a guaranteed money maker lying dormant! But nooooooooooooooo we are not going to put this on DVD and make money! No Sir! let the fans suck it up, we'll release it when they're all dead! Capitalism is sooooo dead, why make money! Right?",1266451200,10,251,4.478260869565218
8327681,5,B001NPDOLS,"At a  time when Warner Bros was having contract problems with Clint Walker, this show ( as well as SUGARFOOT with Will Hutchins ) were created to fill the void. Ty Hardin stars as a former Confederate officer now traveling the west as a scout.  A fondly remembered tv oater that ran for a couple of seasons. A time when westerns (and private eyes) dominated network tv: LAWMAN, DEATH VALLEY DAYS, WYATT EARP, BAT MASTERSON, CHEYENNE, WAGON TRAIN et al.",1234915200,25,452,4.6375
