8173810,4,B000G8NZ76,"A nice Italian film. The 35mm (1.85:1) film transfer to DVD (16:9) is very, very good. The film has English subtitles. A well directed film by Enrico Oldoini, who worte also the screenplay. The cast is excellent! Giancarlo Giannini is fantastic, Nicolas Vaporidis as the young Giulio. Kasia Smutniak as Anna. A terrific film that you will feel that nostalgia!",1411171200,,359,5.0
