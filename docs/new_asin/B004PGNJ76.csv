4444363,5,B004PGNJ76,I find those materials really useful. They really helped me with some relief. If you are constant and follow the instructions correctly you might also get some relief too. Really nice exercises.,1323302400,3,194,5.09375
4444364,4,B004PGNJ76,"I went ahead and bought this and see what excercise he recommends for Scoliosis aside from the Scroth technique.. Although the dvd is not a workout dvd. its only instructional in the 3 segment : stretching, stabilizing and strengthening.

I am using another dvd from the Jaseng group for a complete Back regiment as my workout and then I would add some of the method from this DVD.The combination of the 2 works for me since I have a right L3-4 herniated disc, facet joint syndrome ,SI joint syndrome and tight rt hip, hamstring  muscles tightness and uncorrected scoliosis. It takes me about 2.5 hours to complete .

I also added some massage techinique  from the Sports trainer with the roller which relieves some tension on my rt buttock and hamstring.

I will add update latter on  to see my improvements.",1323043200,10,809,4.702127659574468

4444366,3,B004PGNJ76,"This DVD has some good exercises/stretches.  Unfortunately, the author doesn't describe sufficiently some of the exercises as far as which side to perform the stretch or movement to target the specific curvature of an individual's scoliosis.  He says ""with emphasis on the side with scoliosis.""  Sorry but that is not specific enough for me.  I would not recommend this DVD for scoliotics but maybe for someone who jusgt wants some good core strengthening and balancing exercises/stretches.",1392422400,10,490,5.407894736842105
4444367,2,B004PGNJ76,The exercises on this DVD are basic and generic.  The exercises are not individualized to the different types of scoliosis. For this reason I would not recommend this DVD. Little bang for the high cost!,1391558400,5,202,4.771428571428571
4444368,3,B004PGNJ76,"The DVD has some real good stretches, and the demonstrations are real clear.  I am giving it a 3-star, because I knew most of the stretches and was looking for a specific exercises that suit my daughter's condition.  The exercises in the DVD are not sorted by specific scoliosis condition as I expected, and as I was able to find on You Tube where I found an Osteopath Dr. that prescribed different exercises based on the type of curvature the patient is contending with.  May be the next edition of this DVD will group different stretches by the condition or spinal curvature.",1385942400,4,577,4.637254901960785
4444369,4,B004PGNJ76,Too expensive although it is useful. I bought the work on amazon.cn without the DVD. I wonder why they do not sell the DVD together with the book.,1384300800,2,146,4.25
4444370,5,B004PGNJ76,"Easy to follow
The exercises on this DVD has helped loosen my back while giving it the support it sorely needed. It was presented in a clear and easy to follow manner that even my mother whos in her 60s can follows along with me.",1363910400,3,229,4.111111111111111
4444371,4,B004PGNJ76,This DVD was helpful as in doing the scoliosis exercises recommended by the doctor. Only issue I have is its a bit rushed and I had to repeat some exercises a few time to learn it properly. Otherwise a good DVD.,1356739200,2,211,4.170731707317073
4444372,5,B004PGNJ76,"Dont be mislead, this DVD is not a stand alone version for the Scoliosis program offered in Your Plan For Natural Scoliosis Prevention and Treatment. I highly recommending reading the book and using this DVD to understand the exercises more. I made this mistake and had to wait for the book to get delivered to understand how to use this DVD. Overall both are excellent resources for scoliosis.",1356739200,18,394,4.8088235294117645
4444373,5,B004PGNJ76,This book is ideal for anyone with scoliosis who prefers natural treatment methods. The exercises are highly effective and the explanations are easy to understand.,1340841600,2,163,5.56
4444374,4,B004PGNJ76,"The DVD provides a good explanation to various exercises, however it is not meant to be used as a routine watch-and-repeat type of guide.  Explanations are brief and the visual demonstration is only for one side, either left or right. So, you can't really do your routine scoliosis exercises with this DVD unless you are ready to pause each time, have the repetitions made for each side and then play next. So the bottom line is to buy the book in addition and have your routines set at your own pace without looking at the screen.",1337299200,20,531,4.53125
4444375,4,B004PGNJ76,"My Aunt suffers from Scoliosis and I got this for her. At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but you can't put price on the health of family members.",1335398400,,154,4.0
4444376,5,B004PGNJ76,"This is definitely not an exercise video, so don't buy it if you have that in mind. However, the stretches are wonderful and highly effective for scoliosis. I pulled a muscle which was causing excruciating sciatica pain. I was in so much pain, I could hardly walk, sit or even lie down. Within 3 days of doing the stretches on this DVD, I felt a world of difference. I can actually function normally now.
If you have scoliosis and ever worried whether an exercise was right for you... then this DVD is what you've been looking for!",1333324800,8,531,4.484536082474227
4444377,5,B004PGNJ76,"So after a few years of working out and doing yoga and pilates religiously, my circumstances changed and I couldn't go to the gym anymore. You'd be surprised to know how quickly your hard won fitness goes spiraling down the toilet once you stop exercising.

Anyhow, I'm one of those lucky apple-shaped chicks with a long torso, big chest, and no butt to serve as a counterbalance. Thus, I'm not really just top heavy, I'm ""front"" heavy which leaves my poor spine and scoliosis with the daunting task of keeping me upright. Anyway, the last couple months have been agony. I've been having trouble sleeping, getting out of bed and even standing up. I'm only 30 for god sakes, so I decided I was going on a crusade to put an end to this pain. Ordering this DVD seemed like a good start.

If you are looking for a gentle, therapeutic series of exercises to address your scoliosis, considering purchasing this DVD.

The DVD gives you a choice of three types of exercises from stretching, body alignment and core strengthening which are between 25 and 30 mins long. One focuses on the low back/sacrum, one focuses on the hips, and the last is a combination and supposed to be a bit more difficult. I've done all three, and they are great, but please be aware that they are truly boring and redundant. Strength training is all about reps, and that is what you're doing here. The sequence of the exercises is well thought out - once you become accustomed to moving a certain way, you'll switch to an exercise that does just the opposite. It works, though. Afterwards I really did notice a difference in my posture, and after a week my back pain has decreased.",1333324800,42,1651,4.570945945945946
4444378,5,B004PGNJ76,"The book by Dr Lau was received promptly, in good condition and at a good price. At first I tried to follow the scoliosis program Dr Lau recommended using only his book but even the photos were not enough and I got confused easily. Eventually after 2 months I bought the companion exercise DVD and it has helped a lot! This DVD has done more to help my back then countless trips to the Dr.",1333324800,5,389,4.2
4444379,5,B004PGNJ76,"My school purchased this DVD for a young man in our fitness program. Although it was purely experimental, we've found the results to be quite incredible. He has made notable progress in a very short amount of time. The DVD covers everything from stretching to exercising to core building. Best part is, no special equipment required. In conjunction with Dr. Lau's book, this truly is a wonderful fitness regiment for anyone suffering from scoliosis.",1329350400,3,449,5.081081081081081
4444380,1,B004PGNJ76,"I too, bit the bullet, and paid what I thought was a rather extravagant price for a DVD and am disappointed with the content. I was also very surprised others haven't felt the same way.  I agree with the other reviewer who expressed disappointment in the lack of a good demonstration of each exercise, etc.  I am persevering (motivated somewhat by how much money I spent on this) and trying to do some of the exercises and hoping for some positive results.  Very misleading advertisement for this DVD and I still don't understand why it cost so much!",1327622400,10,550,4.591836734693878
4444381,2,B004PGNJ76,"In all honesty I bought this DVD because of it's sterling reviews below. However, I am greatly disappointed and would not recommend this DVD to those who want a thorough as well as relaxing experience trying to heal their body of/ or prevent scoliosis.

I thought this would be a ""step by step"" DVD without the need for equipment and  or assistance. There are multiple exercises that require an exercise ball or someone to help you complete the exercise and or stretch.

The DVD formatting also lacks the ability to leave the current exercise and return to the main menu. I know how to operate a DVD player and remote. This is clearly an internal issue as my other DVD's have the ability to go back to the main menu when I press ""menu."" It just keeps repeating the current exercise.

I DISLIKE how fast each stretch and exercise is demonstrated. If this is a DVD I am paying $50 for I want this to be a step by step process - don't show me how to do one side in 10 seconds and move on to the next stretch and/ or exercise. It's as if they are trying to rush through everything and I just get frustrated and anxious with the whole process.

All in all, I am saddened I paid what I did to get what I believe is a subpar product that seemed to be all about quantity (the amount of exercises and stretches demonstrated) not quality (step by step, educational, etc).",1326412800,50,1361,4.32156862745098
4444382,5,B004PGNJ76,"I hurt my back last year and have suffered from scoliosis since my teens, was unable to fold forward, or sit. When given the go ahead by my doctor to move again, I found the Scoliosis Exercises for Prevention and Correction DVD, and Your Plan for Natural Scoliosis Prevention and Treatment BOOK, to be the only workouts that I could do without increasing my injury. In fact, it helped do the exact opposite and helped HEAL and Straighten my back. After 9 weeks, I went from having a severe condition to being clean and clear. I did not take any drugs. I went to the chiropractor regularly, iced my injury, and did the recommended diet and exercise plan, and I feel better than ever!!!

8437645,4,B004PGNJ76,"It has been very helpful with my back problems that I have had. He simply introduces each exercise 2x to make sure you are doing them correctly. Then he moves onto the next exercise. There are some excercises that need a bench, which I don't do. Some you do with a ball or on the floor.
Most excercises are very helpful, so I gave it a good rating. Most of the excercises help the neck, shoulders and back. It works for me and am very happy with the results and have lost 5 pounds and feel much better and sleep better at night, without purchasing a new expensive mattress.",1464998400,,573,4.26605504587156

8437651,5,B004PGNJ76,I had bought the first edition DVD 5 years ago and we happy to hear that an updated version was released with new exercises. The exercise DVD presented here is better than ever with clear voice overs and good camera work. I have been doing the scoliosis exercises promoted by Dr. Lau over the years and have found them to be a blessing. Years of physiotherapists and doctor visits cant compare to the advice and recommendations he has shared in his books and DVD.
