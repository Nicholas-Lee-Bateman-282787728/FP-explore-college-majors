If you haven't watched a Koran drfma yet, this is a good one to start with!  Just wondeful, if you are tired of watching Doris Day, take a break and try this!",1414108800,,260,4.078431372549019
8274723,5,B0019MPF8U,"I am reviewing the whole series here. It is wonderful. The best stars, stories, acting, etc. Because it was done by YA, I took a chance and was not disappointed at all. Parts of it might seem to drag, but I don't care for speed in a good story line. It was shocking and sad in the beginning and so tragic. It took so long for people to appreciate her and then just when it seems her life was going to be great, another shocking twist and turn. Over that hump and back on track she continues forward trying to reach her goal. Finally she is almost there and you guessed it, another incredible twist that I swear, can only be done in an Asian drama in such a way. Laws and family values are so different here we would never put up with some of what she does, but In Korea these laws are the way they are and families think nothing of helping or interfering or taking over. She has such a genuine good heart, she never brings up the past to her in-laws who give her a home, but not willingly. You just have to watch it to believe it all. If you liked this lovely actress in Jumong you are going to really like her in this totally different story.",1372982400,,1143,4.107142857142857
