6658176,3,B00NJ4U5U4,"This season is wandering too close to mediocre soap opera drama. Is it a show about police detectives or interpersonal dysfunction...? I am (possibly was) drawn to the show because they took a new approach to crime and punishment which is largely missing from this season.

The issue with Juliette is top on the list. Another reviewer made the inevitable comparison to 'jumping the shark' but this show became a victim of its own strengths. They have a very strong cast and a compelling storyline which made every member of the ensemble critical. I imagine the minor actors, whose great supporting roles made the show what it is, demanding more screen time, better lines, higher pay, greater depth, etc. or they would quit. They got what they wanted and it has almost ruined the show as every character becomes the 'star' of at least one episode and irreversibly alters the primary storyline.

The problem is, of course, there is a set of human conditions/interactions that these shows must present so viewers like the show; as the actors take on broader involvement their original purpose is changed and must be replaced so viewers will watch. The show can't hire and build-up new actors/characters all time so the necessary human stuff is passed around the existing cast members causing a weird, whiplash effect. This show has simply created too many parallel threads that seem contrived just to make long-time supporting actors more prominent. It feels unplanned and haphazard.

Here's the bad news.

- Captain Renard just seems like the character they really want to do something with but just can't figure it out. As the Captain just floats along he's become more and more integrated and, thus, more and more irreplaceable. The show seems to have accidentally built an entire sub-plot out of his story as they've used him to fulfill various key actions for which they likely didn't want to import a new actor. That's made Captain Renard weirdly pivotal to the plot without really contributing anything; he's always just in the middle of everything hanging out.
- Juliette...where to even start. She started as NIck's sweet pathway back to 'normal' with her naive understanding but stalwart support. Nick, the character, needs a normal human side so viewers can see him from their perspective. It was inevitable that Juliette be brought into the fold but a massive misstep to tie her character to the Adalind baby boom fiasco. Then the show shot itself in the foot by somehow making Juliette an evil antagonist as she commits irreversibly destructive acts and in so doing sacrifices any hope that she'll ever be the character she was created to be. The entire cat-scratch-fever sub-plot should be written off as a bad dream sequence.
- Adalind, oddly enough, was the original evil antagonist and has now swapped those roles with Juliette. The entire show slows down every time Adalind has a scene but they can't get rid of her now because she's so interwoven with the soap opera drama. She may be a very smart Hexenbeast but she hasn't managed to master the rhythm method. This entire character line is reminiscent of day-time soap opera drama - please stop, it's painful not knowing how far to fast-forward. Why doesn't Nick just take the kid and kill Adalind?

There is good news however.
- Wu remains the snarky comic relief along the way and a critical supporting character. The character is played well and adds the briefest bit of levity to nearly every scene he's in. But, the cookie incident provided a platform to commit too many minutes to his mental health and recovery leading to the character joining the primary cast. This
- Monroe has consistently played a strong supporting role. If that was planned, bravo! If it was unplanned, bravo! Much of Monroe's additions are squarely on Silas MItchell himself for the way he plays the part. The entire Monroe-Rosalee storyline is nicely done and avoids dragging down the rest of the show.
- Bud and Hank are also exceptions. They aren't the lead storyline even though Russell Hornsby get 'staring' credit. These characters have done just what they are supposed to do in rounding out the show. Hank is as prominent as Nick on screen but manages to simply hold the entire show together without taking the limelight. He'shas been the central figure for three shows over four seasons and none of those resulted in permanent threads or catastrophic changes.

I think I get that trailer scenes were an extra bit of shooting that needed to be done and practically speaking the director needed to consolidate sets as the plot splits into multiple threads. Thus, all Nick's grim stuff ends up at the spice shop - whatever. But, there were other ways of pulling off that kind of thing without making everyone hate Juliette.

There are several sub-plots that just seem to have become uninteresting and/or burdensome without explanation. First, the royal family from Austria is more or less miraculously wiped-out without context and largely off-stage - that's odd. It seems viewers just weren't interested in the royals. Second, Kelly Burkhart is never heard from again except for a completely out of character response to Juliette's email - WTF? Why would the most stealthy, cunning and tactical character simply stroll back into Nick's house AND bring the kid; she outsmarted nearly the entire Verat in Europe but somehow falls prey to the ole ""Nick might be in danger"". I get it, these plots could have an entire show-life of their own and were likely too tangential to carry. But, it all just seems random as though the writers are using a dart board for plot shifts (oh, look, a 9. I guess we'll have to kill the royal family.).

Overall, I begin season 5 with trepidation. This show is beginning to feel like LOST. Possibly I'd be better of just stopping now and assuming it wraps-up the way I want rather than watching the slow and painful death-spiral that seems to be coming.",1521417600,,5935,4.869306930693069

6658194,1,B00NJ4U5U4,"Seriously, this is the worst season I've ever seen. Nick was RAPED by Adalind. Juliette was NOT the victim of that. He owes nothing to his rapists eggs, and Juliette turning into HIS rapist????? I don't even know what to think of that. Oh yeah, then have him shack up with his rapist to make it all better. Might as well have Kelly pay Adalind some silver, force Nick to marry her and go fully Biblical. And what's up with that whole frog family of rape victims being treated criminally as though it's THEIR FAULT they're getting raped, and equating rape with beauty? Branding their faces to stop supposedly supernatural rape inclinations? Seriously?  Oh yeah, and taking away their natural defense mechanism against rape as the solution... Jesus. Anyway these writers are super rape happy (while also not understanding anything about trauma at all or even who the victim IS in the situation because in their minds a woman cannot possibly rape an all-powerful man) which makes me super unhappy.",1512345600,,994,4.847058823529411

6658210,3,B00NJ4U5U4,"Really a big fan of the series, but believe Grimm would still be on the air if it were not for season 4. All other seasons were great, but season 4 went in a direction that was disastrous to all the 'hopeful romantics'.  I'm sure there are those that will defend what the writers did, but it won't change the fact that many people dropped the series after what happened with Juliet, Nick, his Mom/Kelly, and the trailer. Really upset that Ms Mastrintonio would no longer be on the show. Thought NBC was saving money on casting. Seasons 5 and 6 are a terrific come back, but season 4 lost many loyal fans, and almost lost me.....but I stuck it out as I love the fantasy concept of the show.....really going to miss it.",1500940800,4,717,4.350746268656716

6658230,1,B00NJ4U5U4,"I have watched countless DVDs, but the Grimm Season 4 DVD menus and other technical bits are the worst that I have ever encountered.  Season 3 DVDs were fine.

When you pop in the Grimm Season 4 Disc 1 DVD, there's an annoying unskippable 26-second graphic logo for Universal, then an unusual menu that asks your region/language.  Fine.  You select, and then you get an annoying but not unusual sequence of unskippable threatening notices from our interstate crime and antiterrorism departments, followed by unskippable legal disclaimer, followed by an unskippable Blu-Ray ad, followed by a sequence of trailers.  The kind of thing that you get the first time you pop in an annoying modern DVD, but that you don't normally have to keep coming back to.  Spoilers: on this DVD, you'll keep being sent back to this, after every return to the main meny, unlike any DVD I have ever seen.

When you finally get to the main menu, they've thrown away the familiar text labels, like Season 3 and almost every other TV episode DVD ever has.  There's now an array of icons across the bottom of the screen, most of them nonsensical.

While you're trying to figure out which icon gets you to the episode list, any time you pick the wrong icon, you get back to that region/language menu, followed by the unskippable authoritarian threats and disclaimers and Blu-ray ad, and the start of the loud trailers.  Every time.

If you pause for more than a few seconds, while trying to guess what the icons mean, because you're afraid of getting dumped back to the threats and disclaimer and and and the trailers if you pick wrong... it starts an autoplay.  And if you try to abort that and go back to the menu from there, of course you get dumped back to the region/language menu, series of unskippable threats, disclaimers, Blu-ray ad, and trailers.

Now, when you finally, by process of elimination, get to the episodes menu, it is a set of 4 still images, with no titles.  So you'll be forgiven if you assume it's actually extras, or a scene menu for an episode.  No, after all that trouble, they managed to make a TV episode list without the titles of the episodes.  Don't back out here, or you're back to the region/language menu and the unskippable threats and disclaimer and Blu-ray ad, and then loud trailers start.

And when you finally manage to start a play of an episode... each time, before playing the episode, it puts up this garish screen saying that you should buy Blu-ray instead of the DVD you are trying to play.

Perhaps a shameless promotion of Blu-ray explains the psychotic production of this DVD.

I've enjoyed the Grimm series DVDs up to this point, but whoever is responsible for the season 4 DVDs needs to be torn apart by wild Blutbads.",1491091200,,2744,4.655601659751038

OMG, I never particularly cared for Juliette's character from the beginning;
I always felt that she was really vanilla and was holding Nick back, but I really love
her as a villain. She kicks ass in her new role as a hexenbiest; maybe the
actress should have been hired to play a villain from the beginning. I am really surprised
with the writers (in a good way) because when good characters turn evil, there
is always salvation for them. However, Juliette did things that had a point of no return;
like sleeping with Kenneth in Nick's bed and helping the royals kill his mother.

6658569,3,B00NJ4U5U4,"I love Grimm.  It is one of my favorite shows currently in production.  With that said and the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I can not stand the Trubel character.  She is a weak character, with a bad actress playing her.  I stopped watching season 4 because of her.  It wasn't until season 5 was on Prime that I decided to power through the end of season 4 and pass the Trubel arc in season 5.

6658585,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"Let me say first that Grimm isn't for everyone. If you don't like sci-fi/fantasy, or strange creatures, or dark themes, you probably won't like Grimm. But if you enjoy sci-fi/fantasy, and are intrigued by strange creatures, Grimm may be right down your alley.

One of the things I enjoy most about Grimm is the cast, and the humor. Overall, Grimm deals with dark themes, but there's lots of comedic relief. The main character Nick develops close friendships with several strange and likable characters, who have become the protagonists in the series.

If you order Season 1 or Season 5 on Blu-ray, be sure to check if you're getting the standard plastic Blu-ray cases (which I prefer), or the crummy cardboard cases. The cardboard cases have more artwork, but are a hassle when removing/inserting the disks.",1484956800,,807,4.970370370370371

The actors are quick and bright, with a much appreciated unusual delivery on most lines. The stories draw on old and ancient tales and myths, with a bit of history mixed in; the writers are well read.

I greatly enjoy almost everything about the series, but am constantly reminded of what a fantastic job the cinematographers and set designers have done. I frequently have to replay a scene because I was so taken by the bold colors palettes used that I miss the conversation!

6658687,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"I am unabashedly a Grimm  groupie.  Enjoy the shows and the actors.  Sometimes I worry about the writers---what kind of dreams do they have? I have followed the program from Day 1.
A new creature every week.  I check under my bed every night.  Monroe and Bud have the best personalities--some of the other characters a little distant and cold.  But I don't miss a show  The Royal thing gets tedious---would have liked to see a ""The Strain"" creature along the way. I am delighted to Grimm Binge.

My favorite characters are Monroe and Rosalie for the love between them and the respect they show each other. But most of all, despite the fact that this is my second go round for watching seasons 1-5, they are fun and tongue in cheek seriousness by the actors.
Sets, direction, photography, locales are all super well done. I am not someone who appreciates violence and gore but this show has plenty of it. Still, I keep watching.

Each character is a fun and unique depiction of something from fairy tales that does not cross over into adolescent absurdity. The show is ingenious. Also, the suttle humor is truthfully life like and hilarious. It truthfully hard to combine hilarious humor with quiet humor and this show has successfully done what major movies rarely achieve. A new supper hero has been born and, too soon, this network wants to take it away. Grimm team, if it is ever possible for you to move the show to another network, do so, please. I truly don't believe that this show is ever possible to lack in ratings.",1481241600,,699,4.6

I think the make-up artists are phenomenal.  I like that the writers of the show have captured folk stories, myths & legends from a variety of cultures to create these characters/stories.  This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time, because I love the quirkier shows; and this one is really well done.  If you haven't seen the show, I recommend starting with Season 1 and working your way forward.  You'll love the characters.",1480118400,,572,4.775510204081633

6659899,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"'Grimm' is an unusual series, one that has a definite appeal to those looking for something other than the usual television hum-drum. In the fourth season, I find myself acclimated to the characters from the first season, but a new character is introduced that adds depth and interest to the plot. There's some touch-and-go moments when Nick loses his powers and another Grimm has to take over, but it may be fortuitous that Nick is temporarily out of the grim business of being a Grimm. As the season unfolds, there are more and more twists and turns for the characters and the plot. The tempo increases slightly from season to season, keeping pace with our interest and familiarity with the series, so there is rarely a dull moment. Instead of relying on the old, tired, tried-and-true method of putting the lead characters into a dire situation at the end of each season, 'Grimm' leaves a few unanswered questions to pique our interest, but not make us desperate until the next season begins. Always, these tricks solve the dire situation with some unprecedented solution that seems lame or downright idiotic. Fortunately, Grimm does not follow this trite method. I find the series growing more complex and more interesting from season to season. So many of the episodes feature new creatures we have not seen before, and threatens to bore us with a monotonous parade of one new creature each episode. But the series does not rely on this obvious device alone, but rather intertwines the relationships between characters to keep the series moving along. Unlike most television series, each season seems to improve in complexity and innovative plot developments, and gradually becomes much more than just the Grimm valiantly subduing each new creature threat...that, in and of itself, avoids the pitfalls of monotony that most series fall into. If you like unusual, take a look at 'Grimm.'",1478390400,,1891,4.987341772151899

6660241,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"By now, there isn't much to say about Grimm that you don't know. Awesome show! There are surprises in every episode. I am hooked and glad I stopped to watch the show. Every character has their own trials and tribulations. Some for the good but others for the very bad. As the Grimm matures and settles into his own skin, so does everyone else who is connected to him. Family is determined by heart, not blood. Every episode this family, your family, kicks butt!

6660244,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"What can I say: I like Grimm. The stories are clever, unique, well acted for the most, and a pleasant admixture of drama, mystery, and lightheartedness. My sentiments are apparently shared by many as the show's ratings have been consistently high. Given the snow's success,NBC  is, of course, cancelling it, the last few episodes to be aired starting in January 2017. Go figure!?

6660268,1,B00NJ4U5U4,"WTF. Seriously. This show was so awesome for three and a half seasons. There was a great overall story arc, a fantastic dynamic between the characters, lots of laughter, lighthearted relief from the more serious subject matter, and an awesome scenario of ""reason and compassion vs. tradition and fear"". Then halfway through this season they decided to nosedive this soaring aircraft directly into a manure processing facility. It's like the writers either quit or decided they should completely alienate their fan base in order to... to... oh, wait, there's no logical way to finish this sentence. I finished this season, sulked for a few days in frustration, then decided to abandon this show for something more worthwhile. Now it's cancelled after a short sixth season. Oh, well. Better than what happened to Firefly I guess.",1476835200,,827,5.133333333333334

Anyone as truly as good as Juliette was portrayed to be does not turn bad.  Nick needs to jail her for life or kill her if necessary; however, the show will probably take a different route.  Sadly, I would still like to watch the story of Monroe and Rosalee, but I think I am done with this show.  Please, don't ruin these two.  They deserve better than that.",1476835200,,488,4.25

6661017,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"Grimm is a show that I have enjoyed more than most.  The Grimm's fairy tale angle and the characters brought to life (trolls, ogres, witches-hexenbiests, blutbadens, hundjagers) makes it one of the more interesting shows.  The writing is pretty good and you really don't know what is going to happen next, except you don't want Nick to die (I wonder how long Hank can hang in there).",1473638400,,383,4.701492537313433

6661129,2,B00NJ4U5U4,"I really liked the first three seasons, but season four took a turn that really put me off.  Not sure I want to see any later seasons.  The relationships between the characters was the best part of the show, and in season four it was like the writers were going through an ugly divorce in their personal lives and working out their anger on the characters or something.  Previously nice characters turned really ugly, a main character was even more of a jerk than usual, and some characters were just killed off entirely.  Real bummer of a season.  I'm surprised the show survived to have another season.",1473465600,,604,4.607476635514018

The story is pretty nonsensical and the effects are cheesy in a bad way. Being a Grimm seems a lot like just being Dirty Harry to me. Nothing supernatural about being a Grimm.,1473379200,,344,4.149253731343284

Change happens, and the characters deal with change as we can imagine real people (or Wessen) might be doing.

However, at times the show can be formulaic and make the characters seem like dullards when they explain things repeatedly.

I'm enjoying it very much. Juliette is better at being an hexenbeast than Adalind HAHAHAHAH!  Don't care for Juliette nor Adalind.
I like that ""Trubel"" took up the slack for Nick when he lost his Grimm powers.

But Wu, Monroe and Rosalee were great. They're my faves. Nick/David is boring and delivers the same performance every week. Renard is smokin' hot, the writers should've given him better stuff, more substance.  The monsters and effects were outstanding this season.
Juliette is just sorta ""eh,"" and Teresa is cool. Nice butt-kicking. Sad about Meisner. REALLY liked his character and Damien's acting chops.

6661863,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"A great season, as many others have already mentioned, with an interesting variety of Wesen.

It looks like most reviewers watched this via Amazon Video. I purchased the DVD, and took one star off for the convoluted main menu on each disk, plus the awkward (English) subtitles.

The main menu seems to have been designed as a generic one for multiple languages. In other words, once you select your region / language in the first welcoming screen, you arrive at one with pictures-only icons... as opposed to selections spelled out, like ""Special Features"", ""Episode Index"", ""Play All"".

The icon choices are *not* all intuitive. I basically had to select every icon, to figure out what it did. And I especially loved hitting ""Play All"", when I only wanted to see one episode (not !). I fell asleep watching it (in bed), and 3 hours later, I woke up to screams & shouts from episode 4.

And that brings up another annoyance. Even if I select to watch only one episode, then after the episode ends, it goes to the episode menu. No problem.

*But then* the next episode auto-starts after a few minutes. Basically, the whole disk auto-plays until you actually turn off your DVD player, or eject the disk.

There may be a few people that like this feature, but I can't see how most people would. Especially as (again) I mainly watch it in bed before I fall asleep.

And, yes, I *can* fall asleep after watching one of these shows :-) It's not *that* scary to me (usually)... although some Wesen *are* pretty scary-looking. I consider this show ""horror-lite"".. and that's another reason why I like it :-)

The third flaw is that there are *2* ""English"" subtitle choices. One choice allows you to see all of the dialogue throughout the whole show.. but it shows the opening ""Grimm"" book quote using the same font as the dialogue. It is not shown in a ""fancy"" old-world font that takes up the whole screen, like all the previous seasons had done.

Plus it's shown at the bottom of the screen, with the rest of the screen being *blank*. It all just looks awkward. True, it only lasts a few seconds. But why even put the quote in there, if you take away its impact ?

It's like Batman wearing a polyester Halloween costume, without any muscle tone... and with a plastic mask, like from 50 years ago !

Previously, this was kind of a cool way to immediately establish a strong link between the fables' old world... and Portland's new world.

Now, if you choose the *other* ""English"" subtitle option, then you *do* see some fancy fontwork for the quote.. but then you only sporadically see subtitles for the dialogue. I still can't figure out the logic behind when it shows the subtitles for this option.

Ideally, the fancy font for the quote should be included in the subtitle option that shows dialogue for the whole show.

Other DVD purchasers may not even have noticed this (or didn't care). But to me, it takes away some of the ""magic"" of the show. It's what helps convert casual viewers... into devoted fans.

And it's like going to your favorite pizza place, but they no longer add extra cheese on top. And you always thought that was the way they normally made the pizza !

But now it seems like it could have just been a bonus frill ? And maybe they're trying to cut costs ? Or you got stuck with a different, less generous chef ? The rest still tastes pretty good... but man alive, it would've been *so* much better with that extra cheese !  ;-)",1468108800,,3444,4.537964458804524

Nick being stalked by a bunch of Germans
Nick killing whatever is causing all the ruckus.

There has been such a good development of characters in the whole season and the plots are well written. As senior citizens, we enjoy the scarey thrill of ""bogey men"" from our childhood that could possibly be in the world today. But if you are opposed to shedding blood and beheadings, Grimm fairy tales is not the series for you. It's creative, imaginative, quirky and definitely humorous in a DARK way.

6662384,4,B00NJ4U5U4,Season 4 was very good overall.  Don't want to ruin it for any who may not have viewed it as yet.  The only serious objection I had was that the character of 'Truble' did not get as much screen time as I feel she should have.  The show built her up and made her an important part of the cast and then **poof** she disappears for 14 episodes.,1464480000,,341,3.985294117647059

6662428,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"The following is a review of the first five seasons.  With Portland, OR as a backdrop, Grimm has a great balance of drama, comedy, romance, secrets and Sci-fi horror.  All the scary parts including almost all of the murder and other violence occur at night.  The makeup on the Wesens range from cute to something that could give nightmares.  All the episodes are loosely based on fairy tales.  Monroe, Rosalee, Bud and Wu provide some humor while Nick, Hank, Juliette, Trubel, Adalind, Renard and Misner give the series a lot of drama. Romance can get complicated with just humans involved, but when you mix in Wesens, humans changing into Wesens, and Wesens changing into humans, the plot begins to pop and sizzle. The show is built on a foundation of secrets.  The writers create an unseen world with provocative characters and draw the viewers into the series by controlling the release of the many secrets held by the characters.  I am looking forward to Season 6.",1463961600,,968,4.795180722891566

6662710,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"While I like the growth and interactions of the characters, I believe this season has had the darkest story arc of the series. I didn't really notice that two of the shows writers are actors Thomas Ian Griffith and his wife Mary Page Keller. I would hazard a guess they're responsible for the some of the unpleasant plot twists this season. I have to say though, The way they continue adding people to their inner circle I'm expecting everyone in the state to say ""didn't you know they're wesson? Overall I find the that the show blends centuries old fairy tales in a modern day context with a degree of continuity that flows through the seasons. I'll keep watching until it inevitably ends.",1463011200,,691,4.626016260162602

Who make THEM god?  And giving the poor babe to Nicks mom?  Please!  Isn't she in the running for worst roll model/mom of the century?  They talk about giving her a ""normal life"", not happening with Nick's mom, that's for sure.  Also, there was a continuing ill ease as their ""bending the rules to suit themselves"" started being less about doing what was right, and more about doing what was convenient, or suited them, the first signs of corruption, and more and more ""this type bad - kill"".

In season 4 Nick turns into a sexist bigot - it's OK for him and his associates (including mom) to go around stealing babies, murdering assorted folk including Adelaid's mother, taking Adelaine's power because she is a hexanbeast - read strong woman who doesn't agree with him, or ""not like him (racist - ""the world would be a better place with one less hexanbeast""  - isn't this the phrase of every racist bigot out there?)"", did he ever spend even a moment trying to see HER point of view?  In fairness to Adeline, he and his mom have wronged her far more than she did everyone else she hurt all together that we know about. Then, because he misses the power, he wants Juliet to go though a vile process to get his powers back, because he likes being ""one up"" on everyone else - i.e. a Grimm, but put the shoe on the other foot let Juliet get a little power and suddenly she has to be ""fixed"" back to the defenseless powerless ""girlfriend"".

She tells him about her problem, what she is, and he walks out, REALLY?  This is all HIS fault, because of his desire for power, then he is mad at HER because of the side effects?!  Given his portrayal in season 4 why would ANY girl want to be with him?  So his friends all gang up on her and when she refuses to be ""Fixed"" they try to force her to ""change back"".  This group has to be miserable for Juliette, she is an educated, independent woman who finds her entire life changed to revolving around her boyfriend and his friends who all have special powers and keep leaving her out of everything because she is ""weak"", can't see the ""monsters"" and ""has to stay home where it is safe"".  Suddenly finding that she CAN see, and can take care of herself, but now she is all alone because her boyfriend and his friends react by THEIR decision as to what she needs to do rather than helping her with her transition - why would she want to stay friends with these people?

So she acts out a little - the jerk in the bar really deserved worse you know, after all, exactly what was he going to do to her to ""collect"" on his payment of two drinks? Tell me you wouldn't act out a bit with all this going on and having everyone you know against you.  Having Nick decide that they should kill her because she won't obey him AND THEY DO was really too far OTT of ""bad Grimm""!  Really bad cliffhanger, and really turned me off the show.  I had hoped they were going to have him see how self-centered, racist, sexist, and bigoted he had become, but they didn't.

Not sure he can be redeemed from this and won't pay find out how they could possibly fix HIM!  Not happy with this turn. The defining of powerful women (hexanbeast) as ""better dead"" because of what they are without evaluating their actions, and the fact that they are as strong as he is, and refuse to obey the masculine Grimm - not a good story line.  Too bad this was such fun earlier, did they change writers?  Are the writers juvenile males?  All the strong females are ""bad"" and killed, wouldn't want my granddaughter to watch this.",1462233600,,3700,4.352256186317321

6663096,5,B00NJ4U5U4,Always great! This season was a little dark but still captivating. I am hoping that some of long range plot lines get resolved in Season 5 as they seem to be dragging a bit. One of my favorite TV shows!,1461715200,,202,4.075

6663106,5,B00NJ4U5U4,It keeps you on your toes. It had a great story line (for the characters) along with the mini storyline for the show that night.,1461715200,,128,4.16

6663118,4,B00NJ4U5U4,One of our favorites.  Was it necessary to include Reggie Lee to the exclusive club of Hank Nick? He rolls his eyes and that's the extent of his insigt. This show is going the route of Heroes. At the end everyone had powers. Does everyone have to be  vessen? Why can't the keep it confined. Eventually they are going to ruin it with to many vessens. The Eve storyline  is ridiculous.,1461628800,,383,4.366197183098592
6663119,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"Great SyFy, interesting and different story line - a touch of Horror (ie Monster & Creatures) may not be suitable for younger children (under 13) ... a different take on Grimm's fairy tales.",1461628800,,190,4.787878787878788

6663129,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"Just when you think the characters' lives can not get more complicated and bizarre, they do.  And they do so entertainingly if you can overlook silly things such as the trailer waaay out in the woods having electricity and the detectives constantly working outside their jurisdiction.  I streamed this series via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1461369600,,358,4.95

You have to start at the beginning or you won't get it, but if you do, it will be worthwhile.",1461283200,,335,4.333333333333333

6663226,3,B00NJ4U5U4,"* Warning: this review contains some spoilers

Let me start by saying that I like this show. I think it's fun and interesting and it does a great job getting you hooked in. Most of the characters I really enjoy (Nick, Hank, Wu, Renard, Monroe) and I am usually itching to know what's going to happen next. However, the writers need to do a better job with character consistency and tying up loose ends. There are a lot of unresolved plot points, especially this season, and they really need to work on explaining certain things in the show a bit better (like what the heck are they filing in the police reports of the cases they solve and how do they keep some of these super dangerous wessen safely locked up). Also, I do not enjoy the character of Juliette. I find her to be unnecessary, boring, and annoying. She has a major storyline again in this season (like in season 2) and, if possible, the character becomes even more irritating. I also thought that the way Nick reacted to her ""changes"" were inconsistent with his character and the relationship they had established between them. Also annoyed they burnt down the trailor, but seeing as how all the major characters knew about it, seems like something bad was bound to happen to it. The character Kenneth was also annoying this season and poorly cast. The actor was not believable as some sort of bad ass and the character had no reason to be so tough (easily taking on hexenbeist, the Grimm, etc). It was really irritating to watch. Overall, this season was good, but not great. Hopefully they'll make Nick tougher, permanently remove Juliette, and provide more consistency and explanations moving forward.",1461024000,2,1667,4.708904109589041

Although there are at times it seems like 6-8 mini plots going and a main one running along as well - each show can be enjoyed by itself.

In today's terminology they would be known as a person with Borderline Personality Disorder. And the rest of the cast is just perfect. Many series run out of storylines after several seasons, but not Grimm. It just keeps getting better and better. Its a well organized series, completing most storylines in one episode and carrying on others for a long period of time. A perfect combination.
The casting for the show is great. You love to love characters like Rosalee and Monroe, and new Wesen characters in each episode add spark to the show. Was glad to see Julianne terminated at the end of the 4th series. There seemed to be no real chemistry with her and Nick.

That being said, the 4th season has a lot of the same problems as the 2nd. It is very monologue heavy with aspiring actors (some good, many not so good) and dialogue that doesn't really fit it. Many times I feel like minimal effort was put into production, leaving a feeling of a lackluster performance. Also, I have problems with one of the main characters (can't go into detail without spoilers). Despite all my criticisms, I very much enjoyed watching the 4th season. This season adds a lot of interesting twists and turns that make for a fun show. If you have gotten past the 2nd season, you will greatly enjoy the rest of the series (currently halfway through season 5).

I had to force my self to finish the season hoping it would get better.  I am not sure I will even bother with season 5.",1459209600,3,484,4.890243902439025

I really like how all the different types of species and special make up combined with the special affects keep it interesting each episode without appearing to fakey. It's kind of a cross between ""The X Files"" and ""Supernatural"" with its own twist. The show is sure to be a classic for years to come.

Occasionally there are some spots where they characters doing things I don't believe would fit their personalities, but then again, the show IS about people that can turn into monsters or all sorts, so.... lol

She's the best actress on the show, but having said that, the plots are not predictable and everything I strongly suspected would happen completely surprised me. I was really unhappy when the trailer got torched and almost lost all sympathy for Juliette when she did what she did with that Royal member, but I really believe there can't be a better show on the air today.",1456531200,,419,4.675675675675675

Juliette's transformation provides some exciting moments, and Trubel continues to be a great addition to the cast. One of the highlights of the season is getting to meet the Captain's Mother.

6663898,3,B00NJ4U5U4,"I really enjoyed this season, each one getting better than the last in regards to action and characters development.
Some of the plot lines were a little weak and I found myself hating characters I did not want to hate and liking others I did not want to like.
I wish they could have brought Trubel back earlier as I was very sad to see her go. Also the whole ordeal with Sean was a little confusing and anticlimactic. Without giving any spoilers it did seem a little as though the writers wanted something amazing to pop but it kinda flopped.

It was refreshing they are incorporating Wu more. To be honest I was very bored with his character the first few seasons, but he seems to have shaken off the really jitters and really cone into his own.

Would have ranked higher except for the ending and the fact a few key characters died.
Granted they might try to bring them back but still it was hard to swallow their deaths.",1455753600,,924,4.366279069767442
6663899,5,B00NJ4U5U4,If you like SciFi then you're sure to love Grimm.  The series is well acted and produced.  There are many twists and turns and enough action to make you cheer.  Sure it's all make believe -  or is it?,1455753600,,200,4.051282051282051
6663900,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"I have been a fan of Grimm since it started. I enjoy the stories and all the actors in the series. Season 4 is a little bit different but I guess character development is part of the series. I mainly enjoy the retelling with a twist of the fairy tales. The  fairy tale costumes, makeup, and characters can be scary but overall its just imaginative. I hope they don't lose that.",1455753600,,377,4.309859154929577

6664022,1,B00NJ4U5U4,"I love the Grimm Series but Season 4 is defective - the pop up menu is completely different from Seasons 1,2 & 3 - when the disc first starts you get something that says ""North America""; English; Spanish; Portuguese; upon selection there is a strange menu that appears with no descriptive information, only icons - there are 5 dvds in Season 4 and is missing episodes 8,9,13,14,18 & 19 so the set is incomplete.  I would appreciate a replacement set that is complete with all of the episodes resent to me.
Disc 1 has Episodes 1,2,3,4;  Disc 2 has episodes 5,6,7;  Disc 3 has episodes 10,11,12 ; Disc 4 has episodes 15,16,17; and Disc 5 has episodes 20,21,22
The quality control is very poor for the manufacturing of Season 4 and I hope they will send me a new set that is correct",1455235200,2,779,4.433566433566433

6664171,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"I really enjoy Grimm, as a fan of some shows that deal with supernaturals and myths. This season had some highs and lows, but overall I think it was good. I just don't like how they tried to transition Adeline from villan to someone you might want to see succeed.",1454544000,,263,4.28
6664172,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"It's very easy for shows to become stale when continuously following the same formula. Not so for season 4 of ""Grimm"". The ""monsters of the week"" we're all intersting. But what I liked most was the focus on the more personalized stories of characters like Monroe and Rosalie and taking Juliette on a roller coaster journey.
I love that Wu is part if the crew now.
My only wish is for Hank to have a more prominent story line next season.",1454544000,,437,4.407407407407407
6664173,5,B00NJ4U5U4,I love how they weave the Brothers Grimm tales into the story with a twist. They also have storylines that play out over the season in additional to the Wesen of the week. This show might just be the most underrated on TV. It's always been on Friday night so it doesn't get wide exposure. It's definitely one of my favorites.,1454544000,,325,4.344262295081967

The layout of all the disks was inferior to the earlier seasons, where word options are replaced by symbols whose meaning can be cryptic. Now, this MAY have been the result of one bad batch of disks. But be prepared to encounter problems on some of the disks. I also agree, to some extent,that the suspense in this season's episodes seems to have fallen off.

The continuing story is worth seeing from the beginning to get the full sweep of it.  Each episode, meanwhile, is full of surprises and excellent stories.  I am not a horror fan, but somehow these characters are so fascinating and, yes, deep--even subtle--that it often doesn't feel like TV.  Or maybe it feels like cable, because so few movies are this cogent.  And believable!  For all its crazy tales, within its own rules, Grimm is very extremely realistic, very believable.  And again, Grimm doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's all part of the great myth of Portland that is coming together in our culture's mind.",1453507200,,723,4.860655737704918

The series deals with different types of monster humanoids, so if you are not into monsters and fantasies, this one is not for you. It does have a lot more to it then just monsters it has drama, comedy, action and at times brings a tear to your eye.  The casting is wonderful and each person acting ability is superb.  The only problem I have with it, is that it is just an hour long, but for that one hour I am taken away from the reality of my world.",1453507200,,593,3.9747899159663866

The whole emotional side track with Juliette and the Royals was not very interesting. Just about everything you could predict and most of it you won't even want to see as it was boring.

6664590,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"Thank goodness for Miss T. Rubel, a proper Grimm with machete to hand and suffering none of Nicks moralistic drippy-ness.  While Nick struggles with the dilemma of being normal or a Grimm, Trubel and Hank kick Wesen bottom as required, Captain Renard lies in hospital, a new FBI agent enters the fray and the ever delightful Monroe and Rosalee search for a cure for Nick. Poor Wu, as ever, becomes increasingly confused while the Wesen council and Royal power play continues as the search for Adalinds baby continues.

That more-or-less sets the scene for Season 4 and there is so much going on that it would be impossible to further describe the interwoven plot lines without spoilers. There are a couple of standalone episodes that do not really advance the plot much, but on the whole there is so much going on that a couple of quiet episodes allow for a bit of a pause for breath. There are some tremendous mid-season storylines dealing with fallout from Monroe and Rosalees mixed marriage and a remarkable change in role for Juliette.

Throughout the season the taut plotting, management of pace and the trademark light & witty dialogue continues to lift Grimm far above other run-of-the-mill fantasy TV shows but this season has a much darker and mature tenor. Season five is currently airing in the US so thankfully we have at least one more Christmas Grimm binge-watch to which to look forward.",1451606400,,1402,4.809128630705394

6664595,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"I like the show, but it feels like it's starting to wind down a bit. This DVD set is a bit weird in its set up as where it normally says stuff like PLAY, LANGUAGES, EXTRAS, CHAPTERS, etc. it's a bunch of pictures/icons (like a home, a TV set etc.). I had a little trouble trying to get to the English Subtitles, and you have to pick your language FIRST (that was weird too) when the DVD first comes on. It came up NORTH AMERICA, English, Portuguese, (and something else). I don't like the ICONS, I'd rather it told me PLAY, CHAPTERS, etc.  It DOES have English subtitles for the hearing impaired and appears to have some extras (haven't looked closely yet).  The show itself seems to be losing ""something"" to me this season. I'd be real surprised if it lasted 2 more seasons after this.",1451260800,,786,4.376712328767123

Then the whole Juliet thing started out good like a character change that COULD have been good but went downhill FAST! I mean come on! She started out semi-okay with the hexinbeast thing then she went almost overnight to a very vindcitive little brat that whined about Nick not loving her! And then she gets Nicks mom killed. I DO like the whole silence part when Nick finds his moms head in his living room.
Monroe and Rosealee part was GREAT! I like the struggle they had all thought out this season but I find it funny that after they got back from thier honeymoon they emediatly went to Nicks...",1451260800,,722,4.395522388059701

It was interesting as well that ""good"" vessons were also a part of the story line. In a strange way, anyone should be able to relate in some psychological level to these episodes as in real life, truly evil people murder, maim, and kidnap children, and so forth.

6664616,3,B00NJ4U5U4,"The series is great, and I really don't have anything to add that others already have said.
Amazon's return policy, while normally pretty good, is sadly lacking in this case. Apparently if you don't watch the entire season within a certain time frame, and you find a fatal flaw on one of the discs (the 5th disc, in this case), you're S.O.L.. You are forced to either watch every DVD you order from Amazon within a certain time frame, or you give up your option to return defective merchandise. (No, I'm not looking for a refund. Just a replacement of the defective disc.)
Since I pre-ordered several DVDs of TV series, and several arrived near the same time, I wasn't able to watch all of them in the time frame Amazon allowed.
Oh well. I love the convenience of Amazon, but I guess I'll have to go back to purchasing all my DVD's from Wal-Mart. THEIR return policy is actually reasonable.",1449792000,,890,4.53416149068323

Walt Disney had made people think of fairy tales as fluff stories ('cept it seems that the mom dies a lot in them--mommy issues?) but those of us that grew up reading these types of stories know that they weren't all wishing on stars and happy endings.

6664678,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"Why is the cast of Grimm so compelling!  Everyone is so likable as they wade through gore without too much stress, and appear up for anything.  Even the sinister macinations of the royal family in far away castles in Austria are somewhat intriguing.  But Portland's ability to slide through night after night of butchery with such equinimnity is astonishing.  Faced with the vagaries of the Vessen world, why would anyone fear ISIS?  And Nick as Grimm extraordinare is such a model of simplicity, friendliness, and competency in what he does best.  This series is so well made I hope it ends soon so I can go back to more pedestrian fare, and not waste so much valuable time watching the beasts emerge from what we take to be ordinary humans.  This must be great fun for cast and producers, who themselves have delightful humor amid the horror.",1449100800,,844,4.700680272108843

6664722,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"I really enjoyed the first three seasons of Grimm. A clever, exciting, at times eye-popping experience. Something happened in the writing in the 4th season. It seemed the writers were digging down into the muck to keep the momentum going. The dungeon scene was really awful and stupid. Like a goofy acid trip that took a big step into the dark-side. One of the endearing aspects of the show is the relationships between Nick and Juliette, and Monroe and Rosalee. Messing with that was irritating. The show is still watchable, and at times a lot of fun, but the magic has slowly dissipated. Sad.",1449100800,,594,4.721153846153846

Even the recurring guest stars do a great job. All the characters are fairly well rounded and fleshed out. That being said, I did have 1(pretty small in the grand scheme) issue with this season involving Juliette. I really felt they jumped the shark with her. Not in what happened with her character, but in how the character reacted to it. Overall it didn't make a huge impact on the season for me, but it was jarring and just plain off.

6664798,3,B00NJ4U5U4,"Before I review Grimm, here's a few things about me; I'm not a genius. I'm not a refined television consumer. I'm not superior to anyone. I'm an average guy, who likes science fiction and fantasy and will watch many things. I do however make a distinction between things like Grimm, or Supernatural, or Warehouse 13, which are ""fun"" but not high quality, and the far better series available today that have much more going for them from a writing perspective. Grimm is a simplistic, superficial, poorly written, bag of cliches. That being said, it's fun to watch. Do not start watching Grimm if you're looking for something thought provoking or if you want to be surprised. Everything that they do has been done a billion times before and many, many, many characters in the series are little more than ridiculous archetypes without any depth. Strangely, the primary dramas in this series generally revolve around the fact that no one tells each other anything until it's almost too late. Miscommunication errors account for about half the interpersonal drama of the series and, in this season in particular, they ask you to accept some really pretty major changes to some of the central characters. These changes are poorly handled, poorly written, not at all convincing and utterly simplistic. If the writers think there's even a small chance that one of their viewers might have missed something, they'll say it again, support it with useless, unnecessary, and cheap ""flashbacks"" and then they'll just explain the hell out of it until there's little question left what they're going for. Every twist is telegraphed to the point that they might as well just write to viewers before the season starts and tell them what's going to happen in each episode. Despite the fact that Grimm has almost zero intellectual value and shows very little imagination in crafting plots and despite the fact that the show infuriatingly relies on the most ridiculous ""cliff hangers"" in a superficial attempt to keep viewers interested (because they don't actually have interesting plots to keep people involved), the show is simple, light fodder that's super fun and fun to hate. I highly recommend it. And also do not recommend it. In equal measure.",1449014400,3,2232,4.986595174262734

6664825,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"Season 4, especially the ending, is a mess. I enjoyed it but it got very dark. We know that the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man; I think it's even one of the quotes they used.
We are shown a world in which evil/monstrous creatures exist, which is fine because it's true enough, But there is no opposing force shown, except for the natural decency and friendship between the hero Nick and his friends. That's not enough. At the end the ""good guys"" have become indistinguishable from the evil ones, going on a rampage and killing everyone who opposes them. They are going solely on their feelings. Julianna says ""I think maybe I still love you,"" before she tries to kill Nick. Nick abandons the restrictions of being a police officer to seek revenge. He's become a man without a conscience or a code of morals, with no rock to put his back against. I'm not saying he should become a Catholic like Daredevil, (though it wouldn't hurt) but humans alone are no match for the forces of evil. A sad commentary on post-Christian man.",1448668800,,1056,4.534031413612565

6665088,3,B00NJ4U5U4,"There are a few things I admire about season 4. The writers were not afraid to put the characters through the ringer. Everyone had something go bad for them just when life seemed to be getting better, but toward the end of the season there were just too many balls in the air to do an adequate job at resolving the story arc. The story line around Captain Renard would have been better left out for example. I would have gone four stars for the season, but the finale was a weak ending to an otherwise good season.",1447891200,,514,4.255102040816326

6665149,1,B00NJ4U5U4,"I concur with other 1 star reviews. (Spoilers) This show has become sexist and very much pro-abuse of women. The protagonist is abusive on many different levels... as an officer of the law (breaking laws, behaving as if laws do not apply to him, which I find insulting to those with a badge who serve honorably), as one with special gifting (uses his ""Grimm"" to play God with ""Wesen""; he decides who lives or dies), and in his relationship (directing his frustration at Juliette, with no compassion for her, when she can't remember him; being sort of ok with Adelind as a hexenbeist, but suddenly unable to be in Juliette's presence when she becomes a hexenbeist as a price for giving him his powers back, which he wanted; insisting that she give up her powers and then taking her acceptance of her new self- a ""good"" witch at first, quite concerned with self control- as an act of defiance against him, worthy of ultimate punishment... of course, the writers demonize her, turning her suddenly evil so the crowd can cheer as Nick seeks to punish her for her defiance).

Many will disagree bec abuse mentality has saturated our culture, so the portrayals in this show seem ""normal."" Gag.

That Juliette would suddenly be ok with killing all the neighbors, endangering Nick's mom, even endangering Nick, etc. just because Nick is abusing her freedom to exist, is crap. Again, it plays off the abuser mentality, trying to convince others that she ""has earned"" the punishment he wishes to bestow upon her for not bowing to his plan for her life.

There are other sexist elements in the show as well. I also agree that it's unrealistic (dare I say, racist) that only the white people are in longterm, committed relationships.

Nice effects & makeup. I like Bud, Hank, Wu Rosalee, and Monroe. TBD on Trubel... they'll probably make her bad, weak, or kill her off, the way this show is going.",1447632000,5,1886,4.706060606060606

6665267,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"While delightfully fictitious, this series is surprisingly realistic in its plot progression. The emotional interactions between characters are convincing and appropriate to the relationship development between them. I feel the emotional portrayal by the characters is the draw to the series and the constant cliff hanging action and plot twists are the addictive glue that holds the viewers loyalty to the program. Excellent acting although, perhaps, there should be more attention paid to make the hairy ""vogued wessen"" characters more realistic and less glowing like a cartoon character.",1447286400,,590,5.715909090909091

First few seasons were a bit more interesting in my opinion, but the show is still as exciting and thrilling as it was the first time watching it. Ideal for fans of fantasy, action, thriller.

6665342,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"If you watched any of Grimm and enjoyed it but haven't gotten to season four for some reason you definately have to watch it. If you haven't seen any of it but enjoy fantasy, action and supernatural...what are you waiting for? It gets pretty crazy at some point, people turn on each other and some people even die! I won't spoil it by going into detail but it has some pretty tense parts and some surprising ones as well. Trubel is getting the Grimm fighting down and ends up being a lifesaver to both Nick and Sean. Sean is having some serious side effects to his mother's spell that saved his life and Juliette is having even worse side effects from helping Nick get his Grimm powers back. I think season four is probably one of the best so far, with a lot of losses and some new friends as well it makes for some great material to work with in the future...oh and Nick is gonna be a dad!",1447027200,,890,4.241176470588235

6665817,1,B00NJ4U5U4,"I hate to give Grimm a bad review but the writers have ruined this show for me. I never thought I'd have anything bad to say about it but last season will be my last season watching. The season started off really great and looked like it was heading in a terrific direction then it totally plummets. I can take character deaths no problem. I watch GoT and TWD so I know it's nothing new to kill off a main character. That said what led up to the end of last season was so out of left field and terribly written. The escalation for it was shockingly quick which made it totally inept. Also there are several storylines and scenes that have occurred recently that I feel could've been left out entirely. They did nothing for the show and are evidence of the sexual culture in TV these days. Storylines such as a pretty woman who is doomed to be raped unless she becomes ugly or turning a rapist, who happens to be a woman, into the good guy while turning the protagonist's girlfriend into an insane power tripping witch. It comes off as very misogynistic. I use to love this show. I looked forward to it every Friday. If I want a darker drama at least I can still tune into Bates Motel, Penny Dreadful and the TWD which are so much better and far superior to Grimm in every way. I wish I could rate this higher but I just can't.",1446163200,3,1326,4.24505928853755

6665826,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"Grimm is very Addicting ! With each season ,it gets better and better,All the seasons are Great ! You get to know the characters and grow to love them all. The character that plays the Grimm can make anyone go from there human self, to there animal self just by looking at them. Everyone is scared of the Grimm, but this Grimm is a cop so he does not hurt them , but he knows which animal they are so he solves the crime. They all turn into some kind of Animal, it could be from anywhere from a mouse to a wolf or a snake.  We have watch all five season a couple of times. The way they transform into there animal side is Awesome! I would highly recommend this to anyone that love's action, suspense,drama, love stories. This has it all !",1446076800,,738,4.125
6665827,1,B00NJ4U5U4,"I got halfway through episode 16 of season 4 before my discomfort with the direction of the thru-line motivated me to read some 1 star reviews. I'm now adding mine because the reviews I've read have served to confirm my fears- that this series is circling the toilet bowl.

What the writers see as edgy is just ridiculous to me. OK, I'm not a big fan of ""dark"", and it's definitely going way too dark. But characters who are supposed to be in love doing stupid things over and over again just so the writers can get their rocks off... just make me feel raped.

After a strong start to season 4, I forgave the ridiculous waaaaay too long ""Juliette can't remember Nick"" story arc of season 3. A few episodes of Juiliette getting up to speed, some team heroics, and the even more ludicrous and dark ""Nick & Juliette breaking up"" slowly starts to poison the fun. I avoided the spoiler warnings, and thank God I did. Knowing what's gonna happen in the remaining episodes, and especially the season ender saves me the trouble of having to watch any more Grimm. I know I'm gonna hate it more and more. Nasty stuff is happening to characters I care about that can't be undone. So... buh bye.

The good news. I won't have to debate with myself whether to pay for season 5 episodes.",1446076800,7,1272,4.427350427350428

6665859,4,B00NJ4U5U4,"I'll try to reflect my feelings as I was watching the show as it aired last year. There will be some spoilers for S4, though I'll try not to give really egregious ones. This season had a lot of really high highs, and a lot of really low lows. For me, the highs outweighed the lows, so I'm giving it four stars.

It starts out with the writers making the wise (albeit frustrating) decision to postpone Nick's getting his powers back for several episodes. Frustrating, because it was frustrating watching Nick without powers, but wise, because when he did get his powers back, thanks to the wait, it didn't feel anticlimactic or cheap. It also gave time for Trubel to develop and for us to see some new sides to Nick, especially his frustrated protective instincts towards Trubel. It was also nice seeing Nick, who has always struggled with being a Grimm, finally realize that he misses it. It felt natural and real. And I loved the incentive for finally moving forward with the cure... after seeing Monroe and Rosalee drop everything to help him in every episode, it was great to see Nick return the favor.

Which brings me to the big high highs... Chupacabra, Wesenrein, and Tribunal. Those three episodes were absolutely fantastic. Chupacabra was the last episode before the winter hiatus, which lasted months (though thankfully not FOUR months like the S2 hiatus!), and it left us with not one, not two, but THREE extremely exciting cliffhangers to chew on. Then the winter hiatus ended, and Wesenrein and Tribunal were fantastic episodes - easily among the shows best to date - that kept me on the edge of my seat and anxiously awaiting the next installment.

Then there was filler, which is to be expected.

And then things started to go downhill. Not only IN the show, but FOR the show. Because they took what was an extraordinarily promising storyline involving Nick and Juliette, and... I don't know what they did with it. Sometimes it almost felt like they knew what promise this storyline for Juliette held, and they did everything possible to circumvent all of that promise. One of the main themes of this show has always been that people have choices about what kind of people they're going to be, and don't have to be slaves to their genetics (see, ""Monroe"")... but whoever the current batch of writers is, I think maybe they missed the memo on that. What they did to Juliette's character... for a long time (specifically, the whole time between the middle of Iron Hans and the middle of Cry Havoc), nothing that Juliette did made any sense to me. Not only was it not identifiable (that's ok, in a villain), but her reasons for becoming a villain were... unrecognizable and not adequately explained. For that entire time between Iron Hans and Cry Havoc, I had no idea what she was thinking or feeling, or why she was doing anything that she was doing. And that colored my enjoyment of the entire rest of the show.

Which is really too bad, because the second half of the season still had some really good points. They did a masterful job of mounting the stresses on Nick's head, for example. You really felt for him. They're doing a halfway decent job of totally rewriting Adalind's character in a way that seems somewhat believable (although it will still take a lot of time for most serious fans to be onboard with a Nick/Adalind relationship, which is likely where this is going, if only because it should take Nick some time to grieve his relationship with Juliette and find some closure). Wu's story arc was great to watch. It was great seeing the Council again in Marechaussee (although the unnaturally fleeting nature of what should have been a far-reaching plot - the Council placing a bounty on Nick's head - strained credulity). Cry Havoc (the finale) was another fantastic episode, almost as good as Tribunal, and definitely kept me eager for where Nick's character is going in S5.",1446076800,2,3904,4.718475073313783

It was a disappointment.  The discription did not fit the picture.
Once again we are faced with the...uninteresting and inappropriate list of videos and movies you offer.  And once again, we ask why have you eliminated from the free (Prime) list of excellent programst that you once offered.  Ah yes, we can still see such if we are willing to buy, or rent, such.  I did ask, earlier this year, why the Agatha Christie series (Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot) were swept into the ""you now have the opportunity to rent or pay"" area; and why was ""As Time Goes By"" (a wonderfully light-hearted series from the BBC) now in the pay to view area?  The response to my question was, either it wasn't your fault, it was Acorn's doing, or, we could, of course, rent or buy.  Acorn wanted more money.

Juliet discovers the bad side effects of making Nick a Grimm again. Renard discovers that being dead and revived is not without its cost. And Nick at the end suffers two major tragedies. There is little cheer in the season. Except for what happens to Nick, it is hard to see what overall story purpose all these tragedies serve. The long running arc about the royals and the resistance would appear to be near an end. A fraction that seems to be neither the royals or the resistance makes an appearance.

8678569,5,B00NJ4U5U4,"while they're all fairly good, not all the seasons were worthy of 5 stars, however, i think this one is.  Every once in a while you're blown away by what was written, as well as the phenomenal acting in the majority of casts, even ones that only show up once & you never see them again seem to be decent actors.  For a change, there's actually a show where the plot is imaginative and you never know exactly what's going to happen next.

the foreshadowing is also quite sophisticated.  Juliette has been showing subtle signs of betrayal ever since season 1.  She acted as if nick was never good enough for her, and wasn't willing to listen to his beyond reasonable excuses. this is  something not everyone would pick up on, but i believe it was indeed ""planned out all along"" that her ""true nature"" would emerge into what she becomes during this season.  Not many shows will plan this out that far in advance like writers of novels do.  but it seems as if the best shows emerge from something that is written like a novel.

though it's very...well...""Grim"" with alot of dark, morbid & depressing moments, there's at least one thing in each episode that's guaranteed to lighten the mood.  i literally laughed out loud when jack the ripper took a joy ride in a cop car with a terrified wu in the back seat.  that's probably one of my all-time favorites.

CONS:  the downside to this is that sometimes they get a bit cheesy and cliche with their wording.  Sadly, it's a incurable disease among all tv shows nowdays.",1531785600,,1512,4.511029411764706
