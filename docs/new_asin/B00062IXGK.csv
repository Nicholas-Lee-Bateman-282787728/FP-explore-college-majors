8037027,5,B00062IXGK,"Bought this for my grandchildren and it turned out to be an immediate favorite.
Some of the attributes that engage children are the old-time Western drama without diluting the capabilities of women, as Annie Oakley was certainly ahead of her time.",1252886400,,247,5.048780487804878
8037028,5,B00062IXGK,"An excellent old TV series with lots of action, family values and a good moral, which is lacking in modern TV programs.  A fun series for anybody.  Truly from the golden age of TV, which is a far cry from the trash and slop that fills the major channels today.",1232323200,,260,4.18

Quality color picture on top of disc

Everything about the production and marketing of this DVD is of high quality, which means you really get a lot for your money.
However there are no subtitles for the hearing impaired or for any foreign languages, but then again you rarely do for any vintage or classic TV Show!
The Main Menu has access to a very extensive catalogue listing, as well a previews of other titles available from Alpha Video Classics.
This is most probably why there are only 4 episodes per disc in this five disc collection.
The picture quality is excellent throughout each episode, as they really did a good job on lighting every scene in those days, so all indoor scenes and outdoor shady scenes are viewable, and the fast paced action scenes are of top quality.
These horse riding and shooting scenes are always a real treat, and would be just as exciting for the young ones today as they were for the young ones back in the 50's, 60's and 70's.
The sound quality is excellent also!
I have watched every episode on all 5 volumes of this collection, and there is absolutely NO fault in picture or sound on any episode, which helps make this series on sale most enjoyable to sit back with the entire family and relive the old days of television.
In case you are wondering each episode has the Annie Oakley Signature Intro and credits, with Annie doing her world famous stunts and shooting a neat hole in the centre spade of a nine of spades playing card being held up by Lofty, while Annie is standing upright on the saddle on Target her trusty Palomino, who is racing past Lofty at high speed!
You just can't get anything better than that!
What a Gal!
I loved this series when I was a kid.
I have lived in Australia all my life.
I was born in 1954.
Back in the 1960's we were inundated with great TV Westerns from the US, and Annie Oakley is one of the best!
