627705,5,6303272991,"This is excellent body toning DVD. I have always been Tamilee's fan.
I loved specially the upper body and buns section and her calm voice and talk makes it even better.
I liked the abs section too, just need to add that to my routine as well.
A must have for a good body toning workout.",1228435200,2,286,4.125
627706,5,6303272991,"I am a very big fan of Tamilee.  I brought her original Buns of Steel and ABS of steel back in 1991-1992.  I had a baby and wanted to lose the weight,  I got toned and lost weight and felt great. In 1994 2nd child did the buns of steel again and loved it.  I have had 5 children and brought this DVD figuring I need to get me back once again.  I Love it the exercizes are right on point 15 mins enough and you feel the work out.  I feel productive.  as far as the stepper..You donot need on if you want the stepper because you feel better but,  can't find one?  Telephone books do the job I use it all the time. Hopefully in 30 days I will be fit and trim...",1225670400,2,658,3.814814814814815
627707,5,6303272991,"I have been exercising with Tamilee on tapes and CDs now for more than 10 years, and I can tell this is going to be one of my favorite workouts. I am alternating between this and her ""I Want That Body"" workouts. I feel that this one is more challenging with less repetition. Instead of doing two or three sets of the same exercises, she keeps changing the exercises throughout the entire 15-minute segments, which makes it a lot more motivating. She does have some of my favorite exercises from other tapes, and also has some new ones that I haven't done before that I can tell are challenging. At first I was disappointed with the arms workout, because it is more of a complete body workout and I felt that I wasn't getting to cencentrate just on my arms. However, as long as I use 8- or 10-pound weights, I definitely can feel it in my arms and benefit from working my legs and abs at the same time. Now if I am crunched for time and can only do one 15-minute segment, I do the arms workout because it does also work the legs and core. Other days I do the buns and abs together, or if I feel really motivated I do all three. The warmup and stretch are quick but worth it. This is one of my favorite of her recent CDs, and, as always, she is a great motivator to keep you going through all the exercises. She keeps them simple, and they work!",1223683200,33,1343,4.1891891891891895
627708,4,6303272991,"This DVD does not have the exact same workouts from the old Steel videos.  There are three 15 minute exercises, one each for buns, abs, and arms.  There is also a warm up and cool down, and bonus yoga program.  While there are a lot of exercises from the Steel videos included in these new workouts, these are all brand new routines (no cheesey music, tights, or bangs).  Still, I think the format is good, because I get to work out all three of those body parts in less than an hour.  Not bad at all.  I would recommend it.  However, if you are looking to buy a DVD that is IDENTICAL to any of the old Steel vidoes, this is not what you are after.",1222300800,15,648,4.095238095238095
627709,5,6303272991,"By far the best butt kicker of all time. Tamilee ditches the leg warmers and 70s hair and steps into the 20th century with the best workout any body can benefit from. I'm 54 and albeit thin, lost my muscle tone. I swear in one week of workouts - every other day - I could see a noticeable difference. If you do the workouts, you will benefit. And, she's fun to workout with. You can also moderate your workout to your level and increase as you go.",1219276800,15,447,4.149425287356322

627711,5,6303272991,"Tamilee is the original Buns star - Buns of Steel etc and she still looks as fit and toned as back then.  I love her workouts because they aren't intimidating and she's friendly, down to earth and motivating.
There are a few different segments here and they each focus on a specific muscle group mainly, and then often, she'll throw in another group to maximise effectiveness and burn.  I especially love the butt section in which she uses a step to really concentrate on them and you feel it not too long after starting.  The ab section is floorwork and the cycling is my favourite part.  I find that's the most effective and you really feel all areas of your stomach working.
Throughout the workout, she cues really well and lets you know that if you can't go as high as her etc, then it's ok, so that encouragement makes you feel like you can keep going on.  She is a very good instructor and I enjoy this workout a lot.  All you need is some weights and the step would help and then you're good to go.  This is a fun workout that you can do in any order and I thoroughly enjoy it and highly recommend it.",1200960000,37,1108,4.2727272727272725
627712,5,6303272991,"The Tamilee Webb ABS, ABS, ABS workout video serves up everything rewarding and frustrating for this long-time Tamilee Webb admirer.

The five-star rating, of course, reflects the rewards of working out with Ms. Webb.  ABS, ABS, ABS presents three challenging ten-minute exercise segments.  I am one of many whom she won with her classic ABS OF STEEL and ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO videos, which came out several years before ABS, ABS, ABS.  Yet ABS, ABS, ABS is worth owning as Ms. Webb does not recycle the moves she teaches in her earlier tapes.  ABS, ABS, ABS guides you through abdominal exercises that add to the variety of Tamilee Webb workouts that improve your midsection.  Long live Tamilee Webb, as I will live longer, thanks to her.

What frustrates me about ABS, ABS, ABS is Tamilee Webb's inclusion of two exercise flunkies, muscular men named Rick and Pepper.  They are nice guys, I'm sure, but they don't help teach anything.  They just distract from the lessons, as do the female sidekicks Ms. Webb uses in another of her workout tapes, THIGHS OF STEEL.  Why does Tamilee Webb, one of the exercise video industry's most renowned contributors, need groupies alongside her?

Then there's the outfit Tamilee Webb wears in ABS, ABS, ABS.  Ms. Webb spoiled me with thongs and French-cut shorts she wore to show off her big beautiful bottom in ABS OF STEEL; BUNS OF STEEL, PART FOUR; and THIGHS OF STEEL.  And on the box cover of ABS, ABS, ABS, she wears what looks like another sexy thong.  But(t) throughout this video, Tamilee wears a full set of workout pants - and I do mean pants, not even revealing her legs, the little tease.

As(s) if to make up for the bait-and-switch, Tamilee Webb's workout pants hug that rear I revere, as if Rick and Pepper spray-painted them on (don't they wish).  ABS, ABS, ABS segments showing Ms. Webb resting on her stomach give the viewer a nice eyeful of her hot hindquarters, thanks to those form-fitting tights.

To ""top"" it off, in ABS, ABS, ABS Tamilee Webb wears a sports bra that shows plenty of her heaving bosoms.  You may wonder why the producers didn't name the video BREASTS, BREASTS, BREASTS.  The way Ms. Webb's top showcases her sumptuous set, I could almost forgive the thong-pants switcheroo she pulls.  Almost.",1198454400,,2272,4.747448979591836

Tamilee's Abs, Abs, Abs offers 3 different sets of abdominal work, each in increments of 10 minutes.  The exercises are controlled, concise, easy to follow and definately targeted.  I reccommend this video to someone who is looking for shorter spurts of abs work and desires variety.  Tamilee Webb gives us both with this video.",980035200,10,507,4.651685393258427

Volume 1 has Abs of Steel 1 plus Buns of Steel 3 or 4 (can't remember), and Arms & Abs of Steel.
Volume 2 contains Abs of Steel 2, Buns of Steel 5, and Legs of Steel. I'm definitely getting them.
But back to this ""Best of Tamilee Webb Abs"" DVD.
There are about seven different ab workouts on here or so and they're all a little different so it gives a nice variety. Plus you can do just one or do a couple if you're feeling your oats.
Tamilee has a sweet, mellow voice that is soothing and encouraging without being condescending or annoying. Worthwhile purchase.
Only complaint, and it's a mild one, is that the DVD case it comes in is almost paper thin and made of cardboard. I had to tear the edges a bit just to get the disc out.

I went online to see if I could find the same one on DVD and found this ""Tamilee Webb: The Best of Tamilee Abs, Abs, Abs.""  I have to admit that this one is even better than the original.  I love that it contains several different workouts that range from about 5 minutes to about 15 minutes each.  Also, several of them contain exercises that work other muscles as well.  Thank you Tamilee - you get 5 stars from me (again)!!!",1346284800,3,742,4.13986013986014

628255,5,6303272991,"This is my second purchase of a Tamilee video. I have never liked any workout video I have ever purchased or seen in the past. I love her videos. Simple, nicely paced, and she's not a spaz. She's got a positive attitude without being annoyingly perky. She's upbeat and gets down to business right away.
Her workouts are never so hard I can't finish them, yet I can feel that I did a workout. For me, it's the perfect middle, not too easy but not so hard I never want to work out again. She's encouraging and never tells you to push yourself or punish yourself. She seems to want exercise to be as comfortable as possible, so that you aren't so afraid to do it more often. I love that about her, because I am a person who hates to work out. Sometimes you have a flickering thought of quitting, but she tells you it's okay to take a minute and then jump back in. That patience and laid back attitude actually motivate me to keep going straight on through. Tamilee is NOT Jillian Michaels. If you need to be disciplined, if you're that kind of personality, you probably won't do well with Tamilee. If you need a more patient, gentle approach, then this is the instructor for you. She still gets you worked out, she's just very sweet about it.
My first purchase is still my favorite, it's the ""Tight on Time"" two DVD set. I recommend that one. Each workout there is 10 minutes, you can mix and match and do as few or as many as you have time or the energy to do. I usually start out saying I'm just going to do 10 or 20 minutes"" (because I hate working out), but I do those and then it isn't so bad so I do another 10 and sometimes a bit more after that. She breaks it up into bite-size chunks that are really easy to deal with. Before you know it you've done a 30 minute workout.",1330041600,6,1776,4.180758017492711

I do a lot of different workout DVDs: Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, Billy Blanks, etc. and Tamilee just has one of the best styles. I love her instruction and the issues she discusses while working out. She is a fantastic motivator, and this lady's moves will definitely get you results! Her workouts are short but SUPER effective, and I was huffing and puffing in no time!

I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who wants rockin abs and buns of steel! ;-)",1327363200,3,660,4.401639344262295
628337,2,6303272991,"I bought this video because I mostly wanted something that would target my arms since this is my problem area, so I knew I was going to mostly be using the arm segment of the workout, but also the other two segments as needed.

Well, I jumped to the arms section, and I was disappointed.  I felt that the arms workout section was really not designed  or focused on to target arms, but it was really moreso of an ""all over"" workout as I felt it more in my abs and thighs with the exercises she had me doing.  In addition, several times throughout the arms segment, Tammilee herself even said, ""I know Im supposed to be working your arms, and this exercise is for your abs, but I want you to get an all over workout"" yada yada.  How ridiculous!  Stay focused, Tammilee!

I felt like she should have basically stayed ""on point"" with what the video said she was supposed to be targeting as the title suggests.  I did not feel like I got a good workout at all on the arms section, on the contrary it worked my abs (nice, but not what I wanted or was expecting.. I already have an entire workout video dedicated to abs).  I was so disappointed, that I didn't even watch the other two segments on buns and abs, so I cant speak on those, but I can say if you are looking for a good arms workout as part of your overall routine or even as a target I believe you are going to be disappointed with this video.

Hope this is helpful in helping you make a choice.",1326326400,14,1450,4.164874551971326

628343,3,6303272991,"I've had this DVD for a couple of years and used it on and off during this time and I still can't warm up to it. All three routines just don't have the same zing to them as, say, Tamilee's ""I want that body"" DVD. The exercises are not as challenging, Tamilee herself seems to be subdued and not her usual peppy self, it just doesn't seem right to me.

The only good thing about this DVD compared with Tamilee's other workouts is that there is only one set of exercises in each routine - you don't have to do two or three sets of the same exercises within the 15 minute period.

I also feel that the DVD would have been better off without the bonus yoga workout. Stacy McCarthy's demeanor throughout the workout is that of a very stern schoolteacher - I felt that she was telling me off rather than instructing me how best to do the moves.

Overall I'd pass this DVD and pick up either some of her old workouts now available on DVD or the DVD I mentioned above.",1300752000,,960,4.178378378378379
628344,4,6303272991,"My title could apply to ALL exercise DVD's, not just Tamilee's ""Best of Abs"", but for me anyway exercise DVD's ""audition"" over the course of months or longer before I decide they're review-worthy.  While you should never confine yourself to just one workout or activity for optimal fitness, I think this collection strikes an EXCELLENT mix of variety and challenge to help keep you fit in your spare time.

First let me volunteer this: I don't wish to discourage curious readers or New Year's get-in-shape folks from considering enrolling in an exercise class at a local club or other venue.  That may be the best way for you to take the plunge, and publicly commiting by signing up for a class might be necessary to get you started.  I have to tell you though--in my experience after 20+ years attending & leading various group exercise classes, most of the New Years' folks are gone by March (if not sooner).  Let's just admit up front that gaining and maintaining fitness is HARD and it surely doesn't help that modern culture seems to tell us that unless we become preening gym rats, we're inadequate or worse.

The truth is, though (and here's something to ALWAYS try to keep in mind) that fitness is for EVERYONE who has a body, and getting and staying fit certainly does not oblige you to adapt any fashion or ""attitude"" conceits that you're not comfortable with.  My favorite analogy is to think of fitness like brushing your teeth--you do it without considering whether or not you should make the effort. You may be best served by working out privately at home, where you won't feel self conscious of anything you might not be able to do starting out.

Which brings me to Tamilee Webb and ""Best of Abs"": this is a compilation of seven abdominal workouts, none exceeding 15 minutes, along with a 2 minute stretch sequence.  YES the focus is on abs, but abdominals certainly don't work in isolation from the rest of your physique, so ALL the torso gets involved and worked here.  I believe this is all material drawm from original VHS productions--Tamilee occasioally closes sements by exhorting viewers to ""rewind and play me again""--so the picture and sound, while adequate, sure doesn't have the snap and clarity of a digital image/sound.

Between the seven workouts there is PLENTY of variety, with only a set of dumbells used in one section (optional).  As suggested earlier, you could ""mix up"" the various routines daily for months before things started to become predictable.  I must say, I don't think they'll EVER become easy; once you're able to work your way through some of the more challenging moves and sequences you become more aware of your form and how it could be improved.  Straighten the leg more, squeeze out higher elevation, try for steadier balance, monitor breathing more carefully--that sort of thing.

Now my ""rule number one"" for exercise video: I am NOT allowed to decide a DVD or instructor ""sucks"" because the workout annoyed me the first 3 or 4 times I attempted it.  If I indulge my frustrations that easily, EVERYTHING will ""suck"" and I'll never get off the sofa.  Recognize that it will take time to get on the instructors' wavelength and properly learn the exercises (equally true if you sign up for a group class somewhere).  Of course as you blunder uphill to that harmonious state, you're gaining the benefit of actually doing the exercise, even though you're less than thrilled by the effort required.  We all have to accept that--again--fitness isn't easy. BUT who honestly doesn't want it?

I had no exposure to instructor Tamilee Webb before I bought this DVD, though I understand she was in the original ""Buns of Steel/Abs of Steel"" workouts from back in the '90's.  She is entirely credible as an instructor; she's obviously super-fit and comfortable with her demonstrations and cueing.  To her credit she does sprinkle in (more than once) the important caveat that you're not necessarily going to wind up with ""six pack abs"" from doing this workout (but allow me to point out that your chances are even less if you do nothing). And, it can't be overlooked that Tamilee's gorgeous, which we all notice whether we admit it or not.  I will assert that any person who attempts to represent themselves as an authority on fitness is going to have to meet an elevated standard of physical beauty BEFORE anyone will take them seriously or accept their coaching. Tamilee scores high on aesthetics as well as professional competency, and manages both without making you feel condescended to (AGAIN with generous allowance for my ""rule number one"" above).

Here's what I don't like: the cardboard packaging--they're charging full price for the DVD, why can't we get a standard DVD case instead of this minimally functional, skinny thing that can easily get lost among our other DVD's?  Also, what's up with the occasional ""helpers"" on these exercise DVD's, demonstrating easier/harder modifications of exercises?  I understand why they're in the camera background, but do they really have to grin like ""surrendered brides"" as they demonstrate their moves?  Certainly this is a complaint I can make of MANY fitness videos, but to me it just feels slightly insulting to see these mute gym bunnies grinning mockingly at me as I struggle to keep up.  (Again see my rule #1--the resentment eases as familiarity increases.)

If you've read this far, you're interested in fitness generally or specifically in this DVD.  Despite my quibbles I have wrung months of use and gallons of sweat out of this DVD, and I have only a few other exercise videos that have been so heavily used.  I'd NEVER say ""if you buy only one exercise video""--You HAVE to be willing to try new things--but ""Tamilee's Best of Abs"" could be a VERY important starting point and cornerstone for either exercise newbies or for ""maintenance"" folks (like me) who want something new & good.",1292716800,25,5891,4.849301397205589
628425,5,6303272991,I've been a BIG fan of Tamilee for longer than I would like to admit. This DVD is GREAT. It offers many of her classic exercises and new ones too! Broken up into several 10 - 15 minute workouts. Perfect if you want to work your ABS everyday!,1291593600,7,241,4.041666666666667
628426,5,6303272991,"I'm not a fitness fanatic but I do like to stay in shape. I have tried a great many fitness tapes with a lot of different instructors over the years, but I always end up donating them to Goodwill and coming back to Tamilee Webb. The reasons are plain. Not only will she tone your body in ways you'd never hoped ( she has helped me keep off forty pounds I lost ) but she does it while being clear, detailed , friendly, and totally unpretentious. All the workouts on this DVD are excellent and a couple definitely forced me to push past what I thought were my limits. I use this and two other "" Best of "" Tamilee DVDs on a rotational basis, 7 days a week for just 20-25 minutes. I never get bored and my body has never looked or felt better. Kudos on the ecofriendly packaging as well. Basically, you could spend a lot of time and money schlepping back and forth to an overpriced gym or you can work out in the privacy of your own home using this DVD and basic hand weights, and get better results at a fraction of the cost. I started with the original Buns of Steel and I'm still happily doing her workouts some twenty plus years later.

628537,4,6303272991,"My very first workout tape was Buns of Steel 4 with Tamilee Webb.  I didn't have a step, so I would use a dresser drawer to work out on.  At least I have evolved from there, partly because Tamilee Webb's abs and buns workouts have been some of my favorites.
I like to do cardio at home and strength training at the gym.  On most cardio workouts, there's not enough ab work, so I always reach for a Tamilee workout for an add-on.  Plus, her abs look good to me and like they are attainable if I just keep pushing play and doing the work along with her.
This Abs, Abs, Abs DVD is great because it puts all of those add-ons on one DVD so I don't have to switch DVD's if I want to do two routines.  Some of these routines I only had on VHS, so I appreciate having them on one DVD as it makes working out more efficient for me.
Maybe it was because Tamilee was my first home workout instructor, but I have always liked her friendly ""chatting"" at me.  She seems to have a great sense of humor about working out and being a home video instructor.  Whenever she reminds the viewer about form, it's usually around the time my shoulders start straining towards my ears or my chin is resting on my chest.
Reagrding music, it always has been background noise during Tamilee's workouts to me.  It's usually calming with a mid tempo, but there is a piece of music in the I Want Those Abs section that has always startled me as it sounds like a cat screeching.  This happens during the beginning of the second set.  It makes me want the work to end there.
The 10-minute abs from the Tighter Assets series is on here too, and that is done on the knees and on your side, really working the obliques.  This is my favorite section.
There are pilates-inspired routines that are also good for the entire core along with traditional ab crunches.  The chair section is not one I ever do, for whatever reason, I can never feel a burn or get muscle soreness in my core the next day when I have done that section.
All in all, there's really nothing to not like about this DVD if you like Tamilee as an instructor.  This is a good add-on DVD with lots of routines to choose from that work your abs in every way possible.",1253664000,48,2193,4.217703349282297

PROS: great incorporation of arms in buns segment; arms and buns workouts better than ""i want that body"" <-- my fav dvd by tamilee; there's a warm up and cool down segment so you only do it once if you do all segments, bonus almost full hour yoga..i haven't tried it yet; though not required, having a step for buns would prob make a big difference

CONS: abs segment is slightly stronger in ""i want that body""; only one 15-minute segment per buns, abs, and arms, instead of 2..there is less variety bc you will do that same segment over and over

this is definitely a great addition to ""i want that body"". i like portions of each that i usually rotate. would have to say that segment 2 of abs in ""i want that body"" is still a challenge for me, so it's a very good workout and gets a slight edge over this dvd",1233964800,7,920,4.1
