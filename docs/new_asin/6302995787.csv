7833686,3,6302995787,"This movie is a shame because :

-First, it was made by one of the 3 greatest french directors.

-The script, by Louis Malle, is simply awesome, when you read it you simply get inside it, feeling really what Malle wants you to, you really know what is inside Jill, this kind of ""floatting"" that's always used to describe her feelings... in the movie, you don't get no sympathy for the characters because you don't fell them near you, they're so so far away...

-The actors don't show the entire dimension of their talent. BB was reluctant about this script because she felt it as a biography, and she and Mastroianni were really not good friends and you feel it in their way to play there's absolutely no fusion between them... Their way to play is really ""cold"".

-It was filmed with a proceed that makes it look like a sunday afternoon television film.

-It's a shame that the movie is unfindable in its original french version, because the english dubbed one is really so so, BB's voice, which is naturally strong and franc and at the same time sweet, is dubbed here by a really flat voice with no feelings inside it.

So I'll let 3 stars : 2 for the script which is really intense and deep, and 1 for Mastroianni, even if his interpretation is far from the great ones he gave us before and after...",1146441600,7,1302,4.426778242677824
7833687,3,6302995787,"Louis Malle's ""A Very Private Affair"" tells the story of a famous star who seeks to get away from the limelight and lead a normal life with the man she loves, who does not have the celebrity status she does.

 Maybe modern moviegoers will say this sounds like the Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant comedy ""Notting Hill"". Perhaps. But ""A Very Private Affair"" on paper reminds me of Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" (AKA The Sweet Life). After all, isn't that what Jill (Brigette Bardot) ultimately seeks? Both films deal with characters who at one time wanted fame and fortune and once they get it, now want to escape it. And isn't it odd Marcello Mastroianni is in both films?

 If you are a Brigette Bardot fan and know something about her life it almost makes this film a semi-biography and adds a certain poignancy to it. Like the character Jill, Bardot started off as a model and then became a movie star who was known for her sex appeal. Bardot became one of, if not the biggest movie star in France at the time. I wonder if Bardot felt odd filming this movie. She must have been aware of what was going on.

 The movie marks Louis Malle's fourth directing effort coming after such titles as ""Elevator to the Gallows"" (one of his best) and ""Zazie dans le metro"" (one of my least favorites). And it was written by Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Jean Ferry and Malle himself. Rappeneau would later become a talented director and writer himself. He has written ""That Man From Rio"" and worked with Malle on ""Zazie"". He directed ""The Horseman on the Roof"" and the more recent ""Bon voyage"".

 But much of this film doesn't feel like a Malle film. In fact it reminds me more of a Michelangelo Antonioni film. It could have been one of Antonioni's alienation films. On paper this movie should have been a masterwork. I mean c'mon, we have Louis Malle directing Brigette Bardot and Marcello Mastroianni, two of the biggest international stars of the time, in a movie dealing with celebrity status. How could they go wrong! But they do.

 First of all the viewer doesn't get much of a feel for these characters. There is little to relate to. I never really felt sorry for Bardot. I never had that feeling that she is trapped. And I never really understood Mastroianni. At times I wasn't sure if he was jealous of her status. His character, Fabio, is a up and coming director working on a stage play. But during production he keeps Jill away from the rehearsals. He says it is for her own good, so the press won't bother her. Or could it be because he wants the limelight? It is an interesting question, but one the movie never fully addresses. All three people here, Malle, Bardot and Mastroianni, are capable of creating works of strong emotional ties. But in the end ""A Very Private Affair"" becomes a missed opportunity.

 And what about that title? There is a hint of sarcasm to it, but, I won't reveal it here in this review. I'll let you discover why on your own, if I haven't already revealed why.

 Bottom-line: Sadly a missed opportunity. The movie never really tells us much about this characters and never really creates moments when we care about them. God knows these people are talented enough to make great movies but somewhere along the way the movie just doesn't add up.",1143244800,7,3265,4.568493150684931
7833688,5,6302995787,"This is an absorbing film.  Bardot's attractive persona combines admirably with the classy scenery of Italy, Switzerland and Paris.  Her emotional distress is the central theme, and it stems from a prolific love life that is more gourmande than gourmet.",1119744000,6,253,5.3
