7975355,5,B00007EFJO,"Be advised this isn't a ""how to play Afo-cuban"" rhythms video. If you enjoy the music of Santana, or something close to it, and are a percussionist, this is the DVD for you. It shows how they used afro-Cuban rhythms to influence what they played in the rock/pop music of Santana's Supernatural album. It is almost a behind the scenes look on how and why. Besides getting a clear well thought out instructional education, they also perform. In my opinion I liked their performance on the DVD much better than what is on the original album.",1387670400,2,538,4.614583333333333
7975356,5,B00007EFJO,"This is a great DVD.  El Negro (one of my favorite drummers) brings up questions concerning the grooves played by Karl and Raul and they answer with great and useful responses, specifically geared toward congas and timbales.  It is basically getting lessons with some of the greatest percussionists of all-time for the price of the DVD.  Even if you are a beginner or pro, I think this is a must have DVD for your collection.",1189209600,4,425,4.64
