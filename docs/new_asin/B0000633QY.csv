1686801,5,B0000633QY,Ronin Warriors has been my favorite anime since i was in the fourth grade. I'm now going on to the ninth and it is still my favorite anime. I have gone as far as joining a Ronin Warriors message board [...],1067385600,4,206,4.048780487804878
1686802,5,B0000633QY,"This is an EXCELLENT DVD! I loved the ideas! I can't wait for the second one!
This is the story of how Sage has gone missing when he went to New York. The fact that he doesn't show up for Ryo's 16th birthday party worries the other four. When they go to New York, Kento and Rowen go head to head against Sage's armor! But the odd thing is, Sage isn't in it!. They meet a girl named Runa, and together, the six have to find Sage and rescue him without falling victim to the same thing!
The Legend of the Inferno armor is the best. (I love both of them, but this one is just amazing)The five armors are pulling the five Ronins to battle. The Ronins face off against the warroir Mukala. He is without armor and wields only a large boomerang, but he still whipps the all four of them,and then kidnapps Ryo and Sage! Cye seems to have lost the will to fight and leavs, so it's up to Mia, Kento, Yuli, and Rowen to find Ryo and Sage and bring them home safely. Which is harder than it sounds. The clash of the Inferno armors is going to be more difficult than anyone could have imagined.
The voices have all changed in their own way, not much on some, a lot on others. Ryo, Rowen's and Cye's all are pretty much the same. Kento and Sage, well, that's another story. Michael Donnovan only voices Cye in this. Sage is voiced by someone else and I personally like it! :) Kento sound way different. It's kind of hard to explain. He still speaks the same way, but his voice has changed incredibly. Everything that they messed up on the TV sieries has been fixed(ie. Sage's kanji is now grace, and Rowen's is now Wisdom). It's an excellent DVD, and I think all Ronin freaks, like me, should see it!:)",1054598400,2,1688,4.2291021671826625
1686803,5,B0000633QY,"First off, I LOVE THIS DVD!... I've been waiting a long time for this one. *grins happily*
Now, my little review of it.
First: The voice casting. Considering this series originally came out in the early 80's, the voice casting isn't half bad. Cye, Ryo, and Rowen all have the same voices, though Rowen's is a little different (sounds older). Sage and Kento on the other hand... ayi. Kento just doesn't sound goofy enough and Sage... I won't even go there. The voice actor of Dais?! Come on, guys...
Good Point!! Cye has a TON of dialog in 'Inferno'!! Which I *ahem* am profoundly grateful for. :) Even if he does go berserk on Rowen and Kento.
Bad Point!! Changing Ryo's Name, Surekill and switching the original virtues from the series. Okay, I know it makes it more correct... But, if it's been wrong the whole 39 episodes, after 20+ years.... LEAVE IT WRONG!! Please!! It just doesn't sound right after being so used to hearing it the other way! 'Rio'? 'Fury of Wildfire'?? (And Mukara's name too... 'Mukala'??)
Good Point!! BEAUTIFUL ANIMATION!... Whoa. I think it's even better then the series animation...!! The guys just look so much nicer! (Not so blocky.) These stories have a lot more depth then just ""Enemy appears= Fight= Ryo has mental break down= Ronin's win= Happy Ending"". It's goes more into their lives.
Semi-bad Point!! If you're used to the Japanese version of these movies, the English versions seem to have a much slower pace.
Great Plots, Cool Bad Guys, Great Animation, Cye has more then half a dozen lines.... I think Bandai did I really great job on this DVD!! Many thanks!!",1051315200,2,1600,4.7178571428571425
1686804,5,B0000633QY,"[see title] In other words, quit complaining about the virtue changes, the pronounciation changes and those other minor details. The reason I say this is because those details that ""changed"" are actually truer to the original, Yoroiden Samurai Troopers. American dubbing rarely lives up to the actual anime, but I was glad to see that this time the voices were fitting. So, they switched from Michael Donavan  to Rajura's (Dais's, for you NA dub watchers) voiceactor. It's actually a more fitting change, when you think about it.
The plots are excellent, the dubbing is excellent (the translation is poor at times, but the voice acting itself is wonderful), and it's got all the quality one would expect of Sunrise. I'm not sure I agree with their packaging (why in the world would you put the first and second OAVs on the same disk), but that's a truly minor concern.",1051228800,2,868,4.825503355704698
1686805,4,B0000633QY,"I have wanted these movies ever since I first saw them. I even tried to record all of them on blank tapes but they were only run twice. If you're a serious fan of anime, get this DVD and the others.
My only regret is that there are no subtitles for the ""Ronin Warriors"" as there are for ""Samurai Troopers"".",1051056000,,306,4.116666666666666
1686806,5,B0000633QY,"The only thing I don't like about this series is that they changed the prnounciation of Ryo's name.
With that out of the way, I think this series is great! I mean some poeple complain of different voice actors, but there's a different voice actor for Mia in the second episode of the origianl series than the rest of the series and nobody complained baout that. It'd hard to get the entire cast back together for any series, so I don't blame them.
Anyway, I think this DVD is definately worth your money. It comes with a whopping 6 episodes, which os more than any other anime title i've seen. Also, the story is great, the plots have been gone over enough so I won't do it here, i'm just gonna say that's it's as good as everyone says they are.
If you like the series, you'll love the OVA, I gurantee it.",1050710400,,805,4.26797385620915
1686807,3,B0000633QY,"I originally saw these in their orginal japanese format, unsubbed at all. So when they came out on dvd I was excited.
First off, the voices are different, which is to be expected. But the differences are not just there. Names are pronounced differently, the 5 virtues are different, and a number of smaller things have changed. Also, the subbing is very hoaky on Gaiden sometimes.
The 2nd series on the disk is much better and a bit clearer on what's going on. All in all it's  not a bad DVD, just produced poorly.",1050364800,3,514,4.468085106382978
1686808,5,B0000633QY,"Though I promised myself I'd wait till a sale, this was just an itch I had to scratch, and I'm glad I did. This was so ripping funny, including the part where Ryo is getting the snot kicked out of him and even the scene where Cye's having his midlife crisis. Though I am glad some of the original cast participated, I would like to know whose bright idea it was to have Dais' voice actor do the voice of Sage, and Kento's actor just doesn't have the same goofiness as the original(some parts he sounds smarter than in the series). Still, the stories are excellent in both plot and putting a bit of normalcy into the Ronins lives.",1050105600,2,629,4.294117647058823
1686809,4,B0000633QY,"Finally, Bandai continues the saga of the Ronin Warriors!  The OVAs were made especially for video, so they weren't shown on American TV after the original series ended.  Which is a shame, because these new stories are definitely worth seeing.  Volume 1 consists of ""Gaiden"" and ""Legend of the Inferno Armor"" (Kikoutei Densetsu in Japan).  In ""Gaiden"", the team travels to New York City in order to discover the truth behind the sudden and deadly appearance of Sage's Halo armor --- minus Sage.  They find themselves drawn into a battle with the demon sorcerer Shikaisen and his (unnamed) scientist cohort, with Sage's life hanging in the balance.  ""Legend of the Inferno Armor"" takes our boys to Tanzania, where they have to fight not only the fierce (and remarkably nonverbal) warrior Mukala, but their own armors as well!  It doesn't help matters that Cye has decided to relinquish his Torrent armor and turn pacifist.  Can the warriors reunite in time to save the world?
As much as I enjoyed this DVD, I only gave it four stars because of a little problem with the voice casting.  In the original series, Sage and Cye were both voiced by Michael Donovan.  Donovan returns for this outing, but for some inexplicable reason the casting people decided to use someone else as Sage's voice.  The unfortunate result is that the ""new"" Sage sounds almost exactly like the ""old"" Kento, right down to the valley-boy verbal mannerisms.  Some of the other voices sound a bit off (it has been several years, after all), but this one is glaringly bad.  Still, the stories are well done and dramatically powerful (watch the scene in ""Legend"" when Cye tells the guys he's tired of fighting).  RW fans should definitely add this one to their collections.",1049328000,3,1741,4.837837837837838
1686810,4,B0000633QY,"""Ronin Warriors"" originally aired some time in the mid-nineties, and I was hooked.  There was literally nothing else quite like it on TV at the time.  I was one of the lucky ones who got to watch it weekday afternoons (someone else mentioned it was on at about 6 in the morning in their market) but even so sometimes real-life interfered.  I never had access to Cartoon Network when they acquired the rights, so when the DVD release began I jumped right on it.
Okay, so maybe my memory was full of holes after all.
When I watched the subtitled version, a lot of the magic seemed to be gone.  Maybe it's just that I've watched a lot of anime since then, but this series seemed average, not special like I had first thought.  While I had come to epect that the names and personalities would be different, it seemed odd that things were just...average.  Still, I've stuck it out because, until now, I've had this urge to see what I missed.
And I guess that may be the key thing:  If you've missed out in the past, this collection is probably the best way to experience it (though I do have to wonder just WHY the DVD needs to be double-sided.)",1042588800,,1140,4.349056603773585
1686811,5,B0000633QY,"Ronin Warriors--known as Yoroiden Samurai Troopers to those of us who prefer subs--is without a doubt my all-time favorite series, and I can't tell you how pleased I am to see a bilingual DVD at long last. The subtitles are a welcome change from the dub, the quality is clearer than that seen on television, and everything that makes it great is here. I have a few beefs with some of the name romanizations and armor name/virtue translations(for example, Seiji's kanji REI is translated as 'Grace' rather than 'Courtesy', which I feel is more correct), but these are minor complaints and I have to recommend this DVD to anyone who loves action, fantasy, anime, or all of the above.",1034294400,5,681,4.73109243697479
1686812,5,B0000633QY,"I stumbled onto this show by accident, and it was already well the sixth episode, but I taped it and got hooked instantly. I was brutally dissapointed--and I wasn't the only one, either--when the series was taken off the air just as quickly as it premiered, but Cartoon Network had the good taste to snatch it up and add it to Toonami. Now it's finally here to enjoy on DVD, and it looks great. Bandai deserves a lot of praise for releasing this as a dual DVD, and including the original ""Yoroiden Samurai Troopers"" episodes too. The voice-acting for the Japanese cast is good, but the American dub is very well done in my opinion. Matt Hill,(Ryo) Ward Perry,(Rowen) Jason Grey-Stanford,(Kento) and Michael Donovan (Sage/Cye) are all excellent in their respective roles.",1021334400,6,770,4.840909090909091
1686813,5,B0000633QY,"The first time I saw this show I thought it was soo STUPID! But, when it aired for the second time on Cartoon Network, I thought heck I'll give it a try. And I'm glad I did. It's gotta be one of the best anime shows I have ever seen. I have all the episodes on tape, but I wish that they were in better condition. I'm so glad that they're bringing them out on DVD, or by the time I get done watching them the tapes look like they're going to break. It's real hard to explain, but I'll give it a shot. The show begins with a shadow sweeping over a city. Then it shows our co-star heroine, and then the annoying little boy that shall stay with the whole show. The first Ronin appears to fight a soldier of the Dynasty, then the rest come join him. After the battle the Warlords are introduced, and dang, are they fine. The next episode they fight a Warlord for the first time, they are then transported to the places their armors get their powers, thanks to Talpa. After that they find each other, battle Warlords some more. Then take on Talpa himself. To find out the whole detailed storylines about the episodes, how they fair against Talpa, and what happens afterward, either you buy these DVD's or pray that Cartoon Network brings it back on. Better go for the first one. ;)",1020470400,4,1276,4.255144032921811
1686814,4,B0000633QY,"Originally entitled ""Yoroiden Samurai Troopers"" (Legend of the Mystic Armor: Samurai Troopers, abbreviated ""YST""), this is one of the sub-genre I call ""God-Warrior"" anime, in which a group of young people is selected/destined to fight a demon or god bent on conquering or destroying the world. God-Warriors wield personal mystical powers in this quest, often through the use of special weapons or armor or both. The anime that began the modern God-Warrior subgenre was ""Saint Seiya""; this was followed by YST, Shurato, and others (YuuYuu Hakusho is one cynical take on some of the ideas; Sailor Moon takes shots both at this and at the shoujo ""Magical Girl"" subgenre).
Imported here as ""Ronin Warriors"", YST was reasonably successful but the translation left a lot to be desired; on paper the lines used weren't usually terrible, but the way in which they were delivered often did damage to the characters, particularly Touma (""Rowen""), who came off as much more a jerk and less of a genius than he was supposed to be.
This DVD issue represents the first time that the show is available for the American public, and overall it's a good effort. Not only does it include both the American dub and a subtitle of the original Japanese version, but it appears that at least SOME effort went into fixing the problems with the dialogue and character names -- in other words, it's not a complete ""dubtitle"" as some hardcore fans would call it.
The transfer to digital appears to have gone well, and the story is as good as it ever was: the demonlord Arago (called ""Talpa"" in the dub) has finally made his entry to this world, which he intends to make a part of his own demonic realm. Against him and his four Ma-sho (Demon Generals) are five young men, the Samurai Troopers: Ryo, Touma, Seiji, Shu, and Shin. Each of them represents one of the modern Eastern elements (the ancient ones were considerably different; the modern five incorporate the Western 4 and add one more for lightning/spirit) and one of the five Confucian virtues (perfect humanity, faith, justice, wisdom, and truth). Yet the Troopers don't know how to use their powers -- they were given the armor by the ancient mystic Kaos (called ""The Ancient"" in the dub) with no explicit instructions -- and without the help of Naste Yaigu, daughter of an antiquarian who had studied the legends of Arago, they would be doomed to failure. Naste is a combination advisor and den mother for the Troopers, who need her knowledge to figure out what to do next.
I won't be able to be certain how much has been changed for the new subtitled version until later; the character names are now all corrected (although, frustratingly, they still insist on using the English names for the armors and special attacks, rather than keeping the Japanese ones and supplying a parenthetical translation; I think Rekka and So En Zan sound better than ""Armor of Wildfire"" and ""Power of Fire"" respectively. I will admit that the latter is considerably better than the original dub's ""Flare Up Now!"", but it's still not even a proper translation -- it would be something like ""fire circle cut"" or maybe ""blade of flame""), but the actual changes that were made to the show with respect to the origin of the White Armor (""Keikoutei"") didn't show up until later. Hopefully they will correct that one major, inexplicable change.
All in all, I'm very pleased by this release, and look forward to getting all the other volumes. Highly recommended; YST uses some rather unique background material, drawn more from Japanese myth, and mixes it with its own approach to produce a deceptively simple and enjoyable show.",1020124800,5,3638,4.831730769230769
1686815,5,B0000633QY,"I loved RW when I first saw it on Cartoon Network, and the dual-language DVD is a prize!  Granted, the first four episodes are a little bit weak, but the series just gets better from here.  It's also fun to compare the Japanese original with the American version.  Great characters, interesting designs, not overly violent and no gore, and a whole lot of fun.  I can't wait for the next DVD!",1019779200,3,391,4.464788732394366

And they are including the uncut YST episodes too. Now I can finally see the original version and see what all they changed when they brought it over.

7958194,5,B0000633QY,"Originally two separate OVAs, Bandai decided to bunch the two into one which irritates me. But hey, at least they are commercially available now, so whatever.

""Gaiden"" was created for the (Japanese) fans, as stated by Sunrise, and it's good solid action. While it's a bit more violent then the TV series (i.e. blood, dead bodies) it's still an excellent story that features our armored heroes. The animation during the two episodes is consistent, unlike the TV series where you could obviously tell different people were working on the characters.

""Legend of the Inferno Armor"" takes a more serious look into the armors, their natures, and how it affects the warriors who wear them. It's longer than ""Gaiden"" and features a new armor, two new characters, and a more closer look on Cye of the Torrent's character. LotIA is like the TV series in terms of action and adventure. Highly recommended for true fans!",1235520000,,910,4.902597402597403
7958195,5,B0000633QY,"I'll admit, I don't bolster a huge anime collection as some of my friends do. However, of all of the anime I've ever seen, the entire Ronin Warriors series has to be within the top 3 of all anime I've ever followed.

This first dvd contains the very first 4 episodes of the ronin warriors, aka samurai troopers which is the name for the Japanese version. Each original disc actually has the english ronin warrior version on one side and the japanese ronin warrior version on the other side. Whichever side you choose, you'll be enamored with the storyline surrounding the mystery and history of the 9 suits as well as Master Tolpa's quest to reclaim them all.

I don't want to give too much away, but the stories of all of the characters including Master Tolpa and The Ancient is what makes this series one of the better ones I've seen in a long time. Many animated series will have episodes that are independent of prior and future episodes, but with Ronin Warriors, it's imperative to watch each episode to know the history as well as the fate of all characters involved. A much hallowed series, this is definitely worth your time putting into your collection.",1226361600,2,1162,4.608695652173913
7958196,4,B0000633QY,"Back in the early 90's, I had become exposed to several cartoons like He-Man, Thundercats, G.I. Joe, and many, many others.  Transformers was the biggest force in my life at that point, and I suppose it was my first exposure to Japanese anime, despite the fact that the series was made here in the U.S. (it's considered an anime because it's based on the toy line which was produced in Japan).  In the whereabouts of 1994-1995, I had become enamored with another series.  In Japan, it was called Yoroiden Samurai Troopers.  Being an American, I knew it as Ronin Warriors.  The series revolved around five heroes that were selected to wield armor against the villain, Talpa, who wanted those particular armors back so that he can dominate our world.  After Talpa was defeated (there were 39? Episodes total), I thought that that was the end.  But it wasn't.

There were three OVAs that were never before released here, and in this volume I am reviewing, there are the first two.  They were originally made in 1989 and 1990, one or two years after the series was completed in Japan.  They were redubbed in 2003, and some of the voices are different.  I find it very strange that Sage (whose voice is exactly the same as Dais) has a different voice, when the voice of Cye is still the same (he did Sage as well on the series originally).  Maybe the actors were friends with him?  Anyways, there are some noticeable differences which actually are quite appropriate and made me wonder why the American dub changed things around.

- Ryo is pronounced ""Rio"" now, like in the original Japanese.
- Rowen is back to being ""Wisdom"" like in the original Japanese, and Sage is ""Grace.""  This makes more sense because I always thought Rowen was the genius of the group, and Sage obviously was the ladies' man of the group.
- I always thought Ryo's virtue ""Virtue"" was weird because it almost seems like an oxymoron to me, but as it turns out, it was originally ""Righteousness,"" which makes a lot more sense (and especially since he used to say in the original series ""My soul is righteousness!"").
- The finishers are mostly different, which I liked most of the original sayings better.  Rowen's is now Heaven Shockwave as opposed to Arrow Shockwave, Sage is Lightning Strike as opposed to Thunder Bolt Cut, and Cye's is Wave Crusher as opposed to Super Wave Smasher.  Kento's Iron Rock Crusher is the only constant.  Those changed above are not as ""catchy"" as the originals, I suppose, but the one thing I do like better is Ryo's, which is now Fury of Wildfire as opposed to the lame-sounding Flare Up Now.

""GAIDEN""
The first OVA is only two episodes long, and it involves a sorcerer named Shikaisen (which is voiced by the same actor of King Kai from DBZ!) who captures Sage and uses his armor.  He wants the other armors as well, and has a trapped laid out for them (and on Ryo's birthday).  There is also a little subplot involving Runa (whose brother was killed), and originally wanted to kill Rowen, but ends up falling in love with Ryo instead (once again, the main character is focused more).  I didn't like the idea of Sage being captured again, but it's a fairly decent two episodes.  Cye has a lot of good lines in these, and makes fun of Kento a lot.

""LEGEND OF THE INFERNO ARMOR""
This one is four episodes long, and this time, the story's a lot more developed and less silly than the previous one (and a MUCH more formidable adversary).  Rowen is off visiting Mia and Yuli and Cye is surfing with Kento.  Ryo and Sage are nowhere to be found.  Suddenly, an African landscape mystically appears in town, and a warrior named Mukala appears.  Ryo arrives and battles him.  Turns out he wears the Black Inferno Armor, and both white and black inferno armors want to go at each other (a yin vs. yang type story).  The subplot with Cye no longer wanting to fight really bothered me because once again Cye gets screwed.  I was really glad to see Rowen do more in this, however, and there's a slight romantic underplay between Rowen and Mia (there's also mentioning of Kento having a crush on her in this OVA).  All in all, not a bad story, as the Warriors figure out they must defeat the two armors instead of Mukala himself.

I found that the animation is a lot better in these, and there's a lot less recycling of animation cells.  The fights were a lot more fluid, and I liked how the storylines didn't drag as much as in the original series (not that that was a terrible thing, mind you, I like DBZ after all).  I'm not sure if I should recommend this to any anime fan because most of you may find it outdated... to the Ronin Warrior die-hard, however, this is a must.",1122163200,,4665,4.5130952380952385
