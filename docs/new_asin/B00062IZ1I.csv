2161233,5,B00062IZ1I,"I remember loving this movie when it first aired on TV.  Watching it again makes me feel the same way.  This movie is heart-warming, fun, and sweet.

The cast is excellent.  Joanna Kerns really has a chance to shine, and she looks gorgeous too!  Della Reese, William R. Moses, and Harley Jane Kozak are all excellent too.

I really find this movie touching.  It is about forgiveness and redemption, and about making those choices before it is too late.  The picture and sound quality were great, and there weren't any bonus features.  I am really glad that I have this movie on DVD to watch again and again -- and it was really a great bargain.",1252713600,3,644,4.482758620689655

I've used several different devices at 3 different locations so it's not on my side. Other movies play fine. This one is all like the pic I've attached.,1518566400,,278,4.470588235294118

This is exactly what Emma does. As a younger version of herself, her estranged daughter doesn't recognize her and Emma is able to give her daughter new perspective and mend old fences at the same time so that by the time the spell wears off, they have found their love for each other again.",1364860800,3,439,4.116279069767442
