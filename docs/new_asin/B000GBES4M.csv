2604359,5,B000GBES4M,"This DVD is definitely relaxing and gives me a sense of peace each time I view it....and I see something different each time in the natural scenery.  I especially like the separate music CD to use in my car or just for listening in my home.  I have very much enjoyed the first SereneVision DVD, At Water's Edge, and am happy to add this newly released one, Mountain Meditations, to my relaxation collection.  I look forward to their next DVD/CD!",1152489600,6,445,4.5375
8130301,5,B000GBES4M,"I use this video and music to play while participants are gathering for a Bereavement Support Group.  The music has a calming effect and the pictures are great.  When people enter for the first time, they usually do not know many of the group members and this gives them an opportunity to watch, discuss with their neighbor or sit and enjoy the music and scenery.  I highly recommend this video for anyone wanting to set the stage for a calm and relaxing atomsphere.",1316304000,,466,4.590361445783133
8130302,1,B000GBES4M,i should have paid attention to the negative review.  the video quality is horrible. looks like someone copied it from the screen it was being projected. i would not purchase this. save your money,1303862400,,196,4.764705882352941
8130303,5,B000GBES4M,"5 Stars for the seller.  3 stars for the DVD.  The music was very relaxing and the scenery beautiful. There is a scene where you see rainfalling, and I would have enjoyed hearing the rainfall instead of the music playing, but it was still enjoyable. I really like that I can listen to the music without having to have the pictures as well. Both are relaxing and offered me time to reflect.",1284508800,,389,4.388888888888889
8130304,1,B000GBES4M,"The scenery was almost all colorless, Winter landscapes.  There were lengthy concentrations on dull colored grasses, up and down them, back and forth on them, in and out of them.  I was very disappointed.  Don't buy this if you are looking for beautiful mountain scenery with variety or relaxing music.  The music was sharp toned and distracting although I have to say the boring aspect of it all did make me sleepy.",1277251200,6,416,4.736111111111111
8130305,5,B000GBES4M,"I love the beautiful images on this CD.  Although is it labeled Mountain Meditations, there are some wonderful images of a fern laiden wooded area near a stream as well as a gorgeous beach section which were nice unexpected surprises.  The music is soft and relaxing and I love the option to be able to have music with nature sounds, nature sounds only or silence.  The included music CD is a nice bonus.  Very beautiful and relaxing DVD.",1269648000,4,438,4.576923076923077

8130307,5,B000GBES4M,"I have a position this is extrememly stressful and involves 10 hour
days.  I can begin to view this and within 5-10 minutes, I am relaxed
  The views and the soft music put you into a different
place and you become totally at peace.  If you are able to view the
entire dvd, you will be so relaxed, you will find yourself yawning and
ready for an excellent night of sleep.",1210982400,10,371,4.183098591549296
8130308,5,B000GBES4M,"I LOVED this video -- I used it during a ""healing party"" to create a peaceful, soothing atmosphere, as well as entertain people who weren't being worked on at the time.  I recommend it highly for anyone who wants to create a soothing, relaxing, meditative mood.",1203811200,9,261,4.673913043478261
8130309,5,B000GBES4M,"Whenever I feel stessed and need to unwind, this peaceful DVD along with calming music never fails to help me destress and relax.  I often use it as a tool to relax before bedtime, and the music CD that accompanies it is beautiful in of itself. I gave this DVD to a relative who was about to be hospitalized and she used it to relax before her procedure.  It worked!  My 91 year old mom who resides with me and has limited mobility enjoys watching it for the beautiful scenery and music.",1200441600,12,487,4.271739130434782
8130310,5,B000GBES4M,"This CD/DVD is a must have. The DVD portion has some of the most beautiful, relaxing scenes that I have ever witnessed.  The musical portion is so calming that I keep a copy at home as well as in my car.  This CD/DVD appeals to all ages and is a wonderful relaxation tool.  I highly recommend it.
