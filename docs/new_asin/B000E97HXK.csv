2510287,3,B000E97HXK,"I have to laugh at the other reviewers saying this and that wasn't accurate.

Now who's to say what is and what isn't, unless you were there! Highly unlikely I would say.

A different perspective of an age old question. We enjoyed the movie and for the money spent, they did a fine job.

When the movie was over and I asked my wife how she liked it, she said it was good, ""but it's not an epic!"" Did anyone ever think that there could be another Moses? Just as the burning bush told Moses in the '56 film,"" I am, who I am!"" You KNEW who he was. To this day, when someone speaks of Moses, you picture one man. I don't have to tell you.........",1169337600,,642,4.039370078740157
2510288,5,B000E97HXK,"A complete departure from the standard THE TEN COMMANDMENTS with Charlton Heston, which was more of a romantic story, this deals with the more probable Moses and his retrival from the river; his life; and the complex politics of the freed people.  I was impressed from its more realistic viewpoints, e.g.,  from the original The 10 Commandmants (with Charlton Heston), the people made a cow of gold; but in this movie it was made of stone lined with glass, not as a god, but a symbol of their conquest against the Malachites and their new freedoms. That sounds more probable. Also, God didn't strike them dead afterwards as punishment as depicted in the Heston version, but most likely, as depicted in this movie, there was a civil war in terms who is the leader of the clan. They learned warfare and simply used it against each other and the losing party was sentenced to death.  VERY INTERESTING!! WOW!!!

Special effects: Actually, I thought the ORIGINAL 10 commandments had better special effects, however, I liked this movie's effects better--it was more conservative, yet extremely impressive at the same time, which made it more realistic.

This movie is nearly 3 hours long--I was enthralled the WHOLE TIME, not one single yawn, not one single instant was I bored. It took me into the movie and kept me in there. I was irritated when I had to put the movie on PAUSE because I had to go to the bathroom--I wanted to keep on watching it!!  YOU KNOW THIS IS RARE AMONG MOVIES. I could not believe the time went by so quick despite being a 3 hours movie. It was GREAT! And sooo incredibly rare that a modern movie can be this great.

Whether or not you believe in the story of Moses for it may be fact or fiction is rather immaterial.  The point is, THE WAY IT IS PRESENTED IN THE MOVIE IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY it happened along these lines rather than in another way. It kept in touch with the realities of the politics and pressures that will manifest in any group, at any century. In the older version of the 10 commandments it presents itself as total fiction with Moses the romantic finding God, becoming Moses the saint or whatever. This movie does not. It's more of a probable slant. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

Acting: SUPERB!!! REALLY SUPERB!! And it was very nice to see Omar Sharif in there, and he did do a very good job. The whole move was awesome.",1165276800,14,2358,4.529411764705882
2510289,4,B000E97HXK,"I understand that compressing five very detailed books of the Bible into one 3-hour movie is going to require some ""simplification.""  But, strangely, PART 1 follows the text of the books very closely, but then PART 2 almost completely departs from the text.  Admittedly, this is because Part 1 (fully half of the movie) takes from 1/2 of one book (out of five), and Part 2 then attempts to cover the remaining 4 1/2 books.

Part 1 adds some ""dramatic effect"" which I don't completely object - mainly stuff that makes sense: Moses has a certain affinity for his Egyptian ""brother"" with whom he was raised.  I can understand that.  And Part 1's treatment of how God talks with Moses is really good.

But by Part 2, God has become an ""eerie inner voice"" or a ""spectral influence"" that leaves you wondering, ""perhaps it's all in Moeses' head?""

But the Books of Moses, in the Bible, show God as a very present, driving force.  It says that God spoke to Moses face to face as a man talks with his friend.  But Part 2 has Moses thinking he is hearing voices whispering in the wind.

And all throughout the scenes of Part 2, in every instance where Moses has some inner strife about what he is doing, in the Books of Moses it is very clear that God is speaking to him plainly all the time, telling him exactly and precisely what to do.

At one point, God is so much a figment of Moses imagination, that he says ""they have to win this victory themselves"" and ""they have to travel through the dessert without him (God)"" to prove themselves.  This is, of course, nonsense.  God was with them at every step.  They were in the desert in the first place because God led them there.

Apart from that, there are the very many parts that just have to be left out to get it crammed into a 3 hour slot.  But it seems to me that some of these are important parts.  And it seems that, unfortunately, a lot of truth is sacrificed in order to accomplish this.

For instance, a lot of the times where people are punished, it appears that Moses has, under pressure, made a judgement when actually, in the text, GOD made a judgement and instructed Moses to carry it out.

Even in Part 1 there was the beginnings of this treatment.  All of the plagues that visited Pharoh, God had told Moses specifically what was going to happen, and WHY!  And He specifically instructed Moses what to say to Pharoh.  But you can miss that with this movie.

Ultimately, this movie is about WWMD, not WWGD or WWJD.

Overall, though, worth watching.  Just realize that for the full story, you really need to READ THE BOOK.",1159315200,53,2578,4.411016949152542
2510290,3,B000E97HXK,"There are good and not-so-good aspects in this retelling.

The good aspects:

a) The best thing about this retelling of Moses' story are the great special effects.  The 10 Plagues features cool CG effects so that Pharaoh's bedroom is filled with frogs, there is a hail shower which bursts into flames, etc. (The naturalistic explanation of the Nile turning into blood as the result of red silt is mentioned.) The parting of the Red Sea was done very well with the new special effects -- the naturalistic explanation of the Red Sea parting is implied with the showing of an underground eruption / earthquake which causes the waves to part.  The shot with the Israelites walking through the Red Sea and the Egyptian cavalry pursuing them was breathtaking.  Furthermore, the depiction of God's presence through the pillar of fire / cloud and the writing of the 10 commandments was very well done. These special effects lead you to appreciate the power and awesome work of God who victoriously challenged the gods of Egypt through Moses.

b) Another good addition is the more prominent roles of Aaron and Miriam.  Linus Roache does a great job of portraying Aaron as Moses' assertive spokesman;  The actress does a good job of portraying Miriam as a gifted prophetess who struggles with jealousy. (However, Moses' wife is not given much of a prominent role)

c) The portrayals of God's cleansing of the bitter waters and the provision of manna.  This version shows the hardships of living out in the desert and depicts how God came through repeatedly to provide for His people in marvelous ways.  Through Moses, God cleanses the poisoned waters for the people to drink and He provides manna from heaven.  As far as I know, this is the only movie about Moses that show these events.

The main deficiencies of this version are the following:

a) The portrayal of Moses -- Dougray Scott portrays Moses as a very gloomy guy who is given to bouts of uncertainty and impulsive anger.  In earlier scenes of Moses as a slave, Moses seems to stare into space as though he is on drugs.  Overall, he seems to be very morose.  There is a scene after the Red Sea parting when Moses is supposed to be celebrating in victory but he is grieving over the loss of his Egyptian friend who perished in the Red Sea.  As I watched Scott's depiction of Moses, I kept wondering to myself whether anyone would have followed him.  I prefer the charismatic and assertive ""Charlton Heston"" version any day.

b) The over-emphasis in the added storyline of Moses' Egyptian ""mom"" and ""brother"" --  This is a plus and minus.  Pharaoh's daughter, who saved Moses and raised him up, is given more of a role in this movie.  It is interesting to speculate how Moses dealt with Pharaoh's daughter, and whether they had a close relationship. This retelling shows that there was some heartbreak on the part of Pharaoh's daughter as she sees Moses challenge the Pharaoh and unleash all the plagues upon Egypt.  There is also Moses' ""brother"" who later becomes the Pharaoh's guard.  This added narrative Moses' relationship with his ""brother"" is where this movie adds too much to the biblical version of Moses' life (in the book of Exodus).  The Bible does not mention anything of Moses' relationship with Pharaoh's daughter or his Egyptian ""brother"" , yet this version emphasizes these relationships as key main storylines in Moses' life.  This detracts from a biblically faithful depiction of Moses.

c) This movie implied that God was a harsh and cruel God who punished the Egyptians with great severity. Why did God allow the Pharaoh's daughter and Moses' Egyptian brother (simply because they were Egyptians) to suffer when they repeatedly showed their affection to Moses? Moses seems caught between a rock and hard place -- he wants to save his Egyptian friends but he is called by God to proclaim God's message and unleash God's judgments upon Egypt due to the hardened response by Pharaoh.  His friends have to deal with God, not him.

d) The main storyline is weaker than the original ""10 Commandments""

I preferred the Charlton Heston version because the script and storyline was much more compelling overall (exception: we could do without the original's overemphasis on Moses' relationship with Ramses' wife).  There were several scenes in the original that I really loved:

a) Moses' selection of Zipporah as his wife
b) Moses' respect for Pharaoh's daughter whom he treats like his mother
c) Moses' selection of Joshua and his preparation for the people to enter the Promised Land at the end
d) Its reverent portrait of God, who is the real center of the story of Moses

I agree with the other reviewer that this version ends with a very bleak note with the judgment of the enemies of Moses.  This version should have ended with Moses preparing the people to enter into the Promised Land.
This would be much more in keeping with the theme of ""freedom"" that runs throughout this movie.  God freed the Israelites so they could be their own nation under God and enter into the Promised Land.

Therefore, there are pluses and minuses to this retelling.  Overall, I prefer original version due to its better storytelling and script, and Heston's assertive portrayal of Moses.  The main attraction of this version is the updating of the special effects -- you really see God's power and glory demonstrated in the 10 Plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, and the giving of the 10 Commandments.

In spite of these reservations, I recommend you all to watch this movie and make your own comparison.  It is a worthwhile way to spend 3 hours in a meaningful and wholesome way.  This movie helped me to appreciate the power of God in using an ordinary man to lead the Israelites out of freedom from slavery from Egypt to be His covenant people.",1158796800,81,5800,4.782128514056225
2510291,3,B000E97HXK,"In terms of adjusted box office, Cecile B. DeMille's 1956 film ""The Ten Commandments"" is the fifth biggest grossing movie of all time, ahead of ""Titanic,"" but behind ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" and ""E.T.""  There was a sense in which that film, with the parting of the Red Sea sequence, was the first big special effects film.  Of course, the story of how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt had more going for it and that story is certainly worthy of further examination.  Yes, ""Prince of Egypt"" was a musical, but it also focused more on the relationship between Moses and Ramses, who were friends growing up, rather than the rivalry we saw between Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner.  Now we have this 2006 mini-series.  The good news is that it does try to tell us a different part of the story in its second half, but the bad news is for every step forward there are steps backwards, and on balance this version does not come out ahead.

The mini-series aired in two parts, with the end of Part 1 being the parting of the Red Sea (not a real cliffhanger).  The first part moves through the story of Moses from the night he floated down the Nile in basket to that moment in front of the Red Sea at a fast clip.  Moses (Dougray Scott) grows up, kills an overseer, goes off into the desert, saves Jethro's sheep and marries his daughter, sees the burning bush and is back in Egypt telling Ramses (Paul Rhys) to let the Hebrews go.  The plagues of Egypt come quickly as well, and there is a clear suggestion of how the frogs, locust, etc., were related to the Nile turning to blood.  This Moses is not raised alongside Ramses, but Menerith (Naveen Andrews), the natural son of the princess, and they are the brothers who are torn and who face each other at the edge of the Red Sea.  Moses has enlisted his brother Aaron (Linus Roache) to speak for him, and this version deals more with the reluctance and doubts of Moses, more so as the leader than as the deliverer of the Hebrews out of bondage.

This is little in the first half of ""The Ten Commandments"" to justify having made the mini-series.  The only things that stood out where the idea that God wants Moses to work out some things in his own mind and the scene where Moses is forced to work as a slave, which this time is after he returns to Egypt.  What is important in the first part is the idea that even before their deliverance, the Hebrews challenge the leadership of Moses.  However, after the conclusion of the parting of the Red Sea the rest of the second half is devoted to the period in which the Hebrews wandered in the desert before reaching the Promised Land.  This is where this version of ""The Ten Commandments"" starts to tell a different story, for a lot happens in the hour between the Red Sea and the Golden Calf. There is manna in the wilderness and turning the slaves into an army.  Above all this there is the need for Moses the Deliver to become Moses the Law Giver.  However, the impetus for this transition comes from a melodramatic irony that smacks of soap opera more than scripture.

Time and time again I question what Ron Hutchinson, who won an Emmy in 1989 for writing ""Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story,"" is doing in this story.  At one point Moses is training the army and Joshua (Karim Salah) refuses because he sees being a solider as an admission of not having faith in God.  Moses then tells what must be the oldest story of how God helps people; certainly it is an older version of the one Karl Malden tells to Jed Bartlett on ""The West Wing.""  The relevance of the story to the point being made is lost because we cannot believe Moses is telling this story.  However, this is a Moses who is not a cool and commanding presence.  His doubts and lack of resolve are arguably the biggest reasons why the people doubt God; they have problems believing in his messenger.

I have always been bothered by the Hebrews challenging the idea that their God WAS God during the Exodus.  What happened at the Red Sea should prove the point once and for all.  The manna in the desert and Moses smiting a rock to bring forth water might be ""minor"" miracles, but they are nothing to scoff at and reminders of everything God did to get them out of bondage.  Being freaked because Moses has gone up on the mountain and you think he is not coming back is one thing, but making the Golden Calf is a really bad idea.  Hutchinson sticks to the book of Exodus and covers the slaughter by the sons of Levi that was the bloody aftermath of the great sin the people sinned.

This becomes the final act before the denouement where Moses sees the Promised Land but is not allowed to cross over.  Hutchinson does play with Biblical chronology, because the battles they fought are covered in Numbers.  However, my final complaint is not about chronology but rather that the story essentially ends with the slaying of the three thousand men, and not as Exodus does with the construction of the tabernacle and the ark, symbolizing the renewal of the covenant, which I find to be the more important part of the story.  I would have preferred seeing this version of ""The Ten Commandments"" be restricted to what happened after they crossed the Red Seas; after all, the Hebrews forget the evidence of the power of God.  The other half of the min-series could have covered the history of Numbers and Deuteronomy, the part of the Exodus that remains to be told in such a format.",1145232000,46,5473,4.445445445445445

2510297,4,B000E97HXK,"I enjoyed this version of the 1956, Charlton Heston classic.  It was high time someone produced an updated version of the classic.  I think this version was well made.  I also like that it didn't include the same fictional relationships that the Charlton Heston version had, particularly the way the old Pharaoh doted on Moses (played by Dougray Scott) as if Moses were his favorite son, and the love triangle between the new Pharoah (played by Yul Brynner), Moses, and Nefretiri (played by Anne Baxter), who tried to woo Moses away from his wife.

Unfortunately, this version includes fictional relationships of its own, including the brotherly relationship between Moses and Menerith (played by Naveen Andrews), and the couple Moses saved from rape and murder in Egypt, but had executed by stoning for adultery, murder, and false testimony in the desert.",1466985600,,856,5.0928571428571425

It could be useful to watch this movie to then study the word to see the differences, AND it is entertaining, and done well enough to get people to watch it and maybe wonder what the actual account of Exodus says? Of course there is some Hollyweird garbage in it but that could also be of use as a motivation to study Exodus? The production values are high and effects are well done, and it is OK to watch imho. The price is certainly reasonable at less than $5.00 with Prime shipping. In fact I think that we'll watch it again tonight.",1463702400,,647,4.4

2510413,5,B000E97HXK,"The Ten Commandments dramatizes the biblical story of Moses,who after following the Prince of Egypt discovers his true identity and sets out on a mission from God.

An oracle has prophesied that a child will grow up to become the Prince of Egypt, and in order to prevent this from happening The Egyptian Pharaoh orders the immediate slaughter of all newborn males. No child in the entire kingdom is spared except for one. His name was Moses, the son of a Hebrew slave. Set adrift on the Nile immediately after he was born, Moses escapes certain death and enjoys a lavish upbringing in a royal Egyptian household. He has no memory of his past, and soon rises to the rank of prince. After he receives a fiery message from God and learns of his true heritage, he vows to reclaim his destiny by delivering his people from persecution and realizing his fate as the liberator of the Hebrews.

The re-telling of this Biblical story unfolds with all of the spectacle, violent human drama, and grand inspiration that have earned it its distinction as the greatest story ever told. Also,the stunning cinematography and eye-catching special effects makes this a highly entertaining mini-series despite the fact that it does not match Cecille DeMille's 1956 The Ten Commandments in terms of extravagance and greatness.",1417910400,,1306,4.904977375565611

2510508,2,B000E97HXK,"Ouch. This 3-hour Hallmark miniseries is a mess, but it starts with so much promise that its ultimate failure is a ringing slap against good taste. The first half of the film takes us from the birth of Moses to the parting of the Red Sea with appealing CGI effects -- more a fantastical or magical style than anything seen previously on film for the miracles -- and some decent tension between Moses and the Pharaoh to keep things moderately interesting. It almost feels like ""Lost"" meets the Bible, with the slick videography (editing is brisk, sets and costumes are exotic and dusty) reminiscient of last year's ""The Bible"" miniseries on the History Channel. Dougray Scott, Linus Roache, and Naveen Andrews do some interesting things as a brotherly family triangle even with roles which feel underwritten or heavily edited-out at times. Moses as played by Scott doesn't really grow as a character, but seems to be reacting to the amazing events around him, which appear to sweep him into the destiny of Israel without any conscious acquiescence on his part, an omission that never really gets corrected in the film. But this is only a minor issue in the first part of the film. The film's second half from the commandments to the wandering of Israel in the desert -- where Moses must unquestionably become a leader -- gets so increasingly bad that you just feel sucker-punched by the whole production by the time it ends. Unfortunately, the screenplay is literary revisionism of the most downbeat and self-righteously agnostic flavor, increasingly preventing the viewer from identifying in any positive religious way with the Hebrew protagonists. This is the kind of the movie where the Egyptian slaveowners are more sympathetic than the Jewish slaves, Moses himself (Scott) is thoroughly unlikeable, it's a mystery why anyone would follow him two steps out of Egypt, and God himself is a cruel judge demanding bloody justice for moral offenses. Producer Robert Halmi's miniseries productions (i.e. ""Cleopatra"" from 1999) always have a vaguely hokey or schlocky feel to them, but this one is downright painful to sit through, to say nothing of being potentially offensive to Jewish and Christian and Muslim sensibilities. Rather than depicting the Biblical character arc of a reluctant misfit who matures into the leader of a new nation with God's help, this film's Moses is a man who gets increasingly angry and more bitter as he ages, growing less comfortable rather than more accepting toward his role as Israel's lawgiver. More at home with his Egyptian wealth than his poor Hebrew roots, this Moses (who runs in fright back to his pampered home after meeting his real slave family) does God's will with palpable distaste, and his character motivations as such range from inexplicable (killing the Egyptian) to downright sadistic (killing his former friends) as presented here. The film's takeaway seems to be that serving the God of Abraham makes human beings (Moses being the prime example) abandon their families, give up all hope of personal happiness, lose their rationality, and violently destroy those who oppose them. Moses here acts with such cruelty in making Israel a nation (ordering the death of children and women after the Golden Calf incident, despite no basis for this in Exodus) that he reaches a point (totally out of character with the Biblical Moses) where he cries out in despair for God to kill him during the great theophany on Mt. Sinai. By this point, I felt so sorry for the totally pathetic and unlikeable Moses that I almost wanted God to do it. The most intriguing Biblical scenes in this film -- like the sweetening of the waters and the battle with the Amalekites where Aaron helps Moses hold up his staff, both of which have rarely been filmed -- are presented fleetingly as resentful and blind acts of obedience on the part of Moses rather than outpourings of genuine faith. Now the filmmakers certainly have the right to indict religions for spreading violence and evil in the world. But there are two problems with that approach: 1. It makes for a terrible film, and 2. It is untrue to the literary source material of the Moses story. On the first point, the Biblical story of Moses is appealing precisely as a story of liberation from slavery and painful growth toward freedom, revealing God as a loving father who suffers with and cares for his people. So making Moses the tortured instrument of a vengeful God takes away any possibility for the audience to identify with your protagonist, which is just bad filmmaking: If your film's protagonist is a religious figure (Moses) whose religion makes him miserable, who wants to see it? Maybe this film's audience is the guy who says  ""I always knew religious people were mean and cruel, but now this film proves it from the Bible itself!"" If that sort of polemical line floats your boat, and if you want to spend three hours stewing in your outrage, this is the ""Ten Commandments"" for you. But on the second point above, this take on Moses is simply not faithful to the account of the Bible, where we find Moses to be a man of deep faith whose relationship with God grows in trust and love rather than hate and fear. In the second half of this film, the details of Moses's life from the Bible are twisted beyond recognition and often fictionalized so heavily in service of this interpretation that we wonder if we are watching the same film we saw in the first half. There's no hint of any reason why the Israelites would follow this guy anywhere. If you want a strong and entertaining Moses film that is also spiritually edifying, look elsewhere. Personally, I think the very best portrayal of this story on film to date is ""Moses,"" the 1996 TNT Bible Series film that was nominated for Outstanding Miniseries, made by the same team (actor Ben Kingsley, director Roger Young and writer Lionel Chetwynd) that created the Emmy-winning ""Joseph"" in the same film series the year before. See ""Moses"" or DeMille's original ""Ten Commandments"" with Charlton Heston (less faithful to the Biblical account, but still more entertaining than this 2006 remake) if you want a take on the story that is literate, edifying and reasonably entertaining. This one is awful beyond all expectations, but I give it a second star for the production design and relatively involving first half.",1381881600,,6362,4.87985212569316

In the movie Moses' Egyptian brother swears he will not kill him, but then movie soon has Moses kill his brother--how crazy!

2510526,3,B000E97HXK,"Although this movie has some very good techno scenes( such as crossing the Red Sea) and is way more realistic than the version that Ben Kingsley  did, there are several sections that are not true to the Bible. The scene where Moses sends his wife and children crying are not in the Bible, and the scene leaves the viewer with a bad view of Moses. The truth was, according to Exodus, Moses left his wife and children with his father-in-law , when he first started back to Egypt. In chapter 18 of  Exodus, his wife and children were returned to him and he lived the rest of his life with his family. Gershom,  his son, is mentioned in I Chronicles and other books as the descendant of Moses. The man playing Moses, in my opinion was not very well cast. I never related to him in the role of a Hebrew man  or as  Egyptian royalty. The main character of this movie should be able to carry the whole movie, gain the viewer's sympathy and I kept asking ""where's the real Moses"", of course I meant Charleton Heston.

2510532,5,B000E97HXK,"The movie ""Ten Commandments"" was very similar to ""The Prince of Egypt"".  Both movies told the story and journey of Moses and the Hebrew.  The Pharaoh ordered all kids to be thrown in the Nile River.  Moses was put in a basket made by his mother and was sent across the river to stop from being eaten by the alligators.  He settled in the land of Mylan and had 2 sons.  God guided him to the burning bush.  He turned his staff into a snake and told him to grab it by its tale then God turned it back into a staff.  Then God told Moses to put his hand in his robe and when he took it out he had a disease on it, God told him to do it again and this time he took it away.  He did this to show Moses his power.  Then he told Moses to free his people.  God performed miracles to show the Pharaoh that he was real and that he was the only God and that he had stronger power.  On the journey to the motherland God carved the Ten Commandments on 2 stones and told Moses to teach them to the people.  He also told him after the 1st generation dies off he will show he kids to the motherland. It took 40 years.  Moses' son Joshua led the 2nd generation to the motherland.  The whereabouts of Moses were never found. This movie went in greater detail about the Ten Commandments and how they were formed and preached to the people. These movies could have been 1 and 2 because they are very similar. In addition, this movie shows how the people were beginning to worship another God and Moses has to warn them that God will not stand for this. This movie was in direct relation to the story of Moses and the book of Exodus.

This directly related to World Religions and this class, because the Ten Commandments are directly from the book. The story of Moses is an important part of Biblical History, because this is when the Ten Commandments were written and provided to the Hebrew people for guidance. God wanted his people to have rules to follow by so he told Moses what to write and Moses did that. This story and the movie are a great part of history and this story can be told in many numerous ways. This movie shows how great Gods power is and with Faith and a push from God you can do anything.

2510541,3,B000E97HXK,"Currently Amazon has three offerings of this movie, directed by Robert Dornhelm, with releases indicated for 2006, 2007, and 2008. Each is listed with a slightly different set of actors on the sales pages.  I saw this on a DVD rental from non-Amazon service.

This is not a ""normal review"".  It compares the Biblical, Exodus narrative for the movie from Moses' birth, to his fleeing Egypt after killing an Egyptian.  The details are from the first 20 minutes -- and only because the movie was so inaccurate (see below) did I decide not continue seeing history fictionally re-imaged.

I'll say this: for those looking for a dramatic story ""updated"" using modern standards, special effects, quality actors, authentic-looking backdrops, the telling may suit you.  However if you want faithfulness to the Biblical account, continue reading.

For example: The movie shows the Pharaoh ordering his soldiers to fan out and kill the male Hebrew babies after a bad dream of his is apparently interpreted by a prophet of Ra, an Egyptian god, warning of a usurper from the ranks of the Hebrew slaves.  But in Exodus 1:15 the persecution of male babies originates quite differently: Pharaoh directs the midwives to kill male babies on delivery. Yes he fears a revolt in both cases, but the formation and execution of the fear differ significantly.

Another example: The movie shows Moses' mother shoving him off into the Nile river to escape the soldiers; but in Exodus (chapter) 2 his mother was able to hide Moses for three months, and then directed her daughter, Miriam, to take Moses to the Nile.  In both cases a waterproof basket was used - the first factually accurate event in the movie.

The finding of Moses by the Pharaoh's daughter (or princess) is similar comparing the movie to Exodus, but the movie lacks the fact that Moses' sister was nearby and offered her mother as a wet nurse, rather than the movie's version which depicts the notion of a Hebrew wet nurse as the idea of the princesses 'mother. -- compare Exodus 2.

When Moses was a young man he killed an Egyptian who was mistreating a slave.  The movie's version is a possible scenario to add meat to the brief biblical account and with with I have no issue, but the Bible shows him fleeing after discovering via slaves that ""everyone"" would know or soon would know of the murder; whereas the movie argues the information came within Pharaoh's household from which he was also warned to flee.

It may be that the movie script was trying to harmonize conflicting versions (there's only one in the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, but I don't claim knowledge of all religions). Bottom lime of course is to judge for yourself if a parallel-universe version of the Ten Commandments era will interest you or offend. The special effects may be ""to die for"" (per other reviews) -- just don't take the movie's story as ""gospel.",1353888000,,2881,4.817444219066937

2510544,2,B000E97HXK,"This version of The Ten Commandments originally aired as a two-part miniseries on ABC in 2006. This new rendition of the Biblical story of Moses, found in the Bible and wonderfully told on screen in 1923, 1956 and 1998, is literally two steps away from being the worst screen version. That distinction goes to the steaming pile of animated crap starring Christian Slater as Moses and Alfred Molina as Rameses. What follows are the pros and cons of this version.

Pluses

I. A stirring main theme by Randy Edelman (Gods And Generals, Gettysburg, Dragonheart). Nowhere near as epic as Elmer Bernstein's grand theme for Cecil B. DeMille's epic remake of The Ten Commandments, which he had filmed as a silent movie earlier in 1923, but still a good one.

II. Dougray Scott's valiant attempt to portray a doubting Moses. Granted, this was a strength/weakness of this version. Moses at times came across as almost heretical several times when describing how God spake unto him. More on that in a moment.

III. The inclusion of the battle with the Amalekites, which is omitted in the 1923, 1956, 1998 and 2007 screen versions. Though Miriam and the women joining the battle is probably inaccurate to Scripture (the Bible is silent on this), it was a good decision in terms of drama.

IV. The inclusion of God providing manna in the wilderness & Moses getting water from the bitter stream which was called Marah and Moses striking the rock to get water from it (a symbolic representation of Jesus, the Water of Everlasting Life), all of which are omitted in the 1923, 1956 & 1998 versions, were also good choices.

Cons

I. Moses describing God as short-tempered and I can't remember what else. Moses also says that God thinks about things and needs someone to help Him do His work. Even Jethro describes the desert as a place perhaps big enough for even a god not to find you. Such views are entirely anti-Scriptural.

II. God speaks six sentences at most in the scattered brief moments that His voice is heard. In the Burning Bush scene, He does not tell Moses exactly who He is, merely I AM WHO I AM, and apparently, Moses has to figure out the rest for himself, which does not make any sense whatsoever. (In the Biblical account, God saith unto Moses, Certainly I will be with thee...after that thou hast brought the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain, among other instructions, which He giveth unto him). When God spake unto His servants in the Bible, He spake clearly and not in parables, leaving them puzzled as to what He saith.

III. The plagues were not depicted as they occur in the Bible, as some of them come on screen with no explanation whatsoever.

IV. The golden calf looked so fake and was so much smaller than in the 1923 and 1956 versions.

V. The parting of the Red Sea was poorly done with the CGI available now. The 1923, 1956 and 1998 versions did the parting of the Red Sea in spectacular fashion (though the 1956 version is obviously the definitive one for adults and the 1998 one for kids)

VI. The Ark Of The Covenant was very poorly done and very small as well. Even the non-Christian film Raiders Of The Lost Ark got the look just right.

VII. The Israelite committing adultery with another Israelite could have occurred and it provided a twist to the story, but I think it was thrown in there to sex up the drama for a modern audience (though no explicit nudity is shown).

VIII. Too many scenes of the Pharoah holding his son, either in his arms or on his lap. Nasty. Besides, the Pharoah looked gay with all the eyeliner on him.

This version is Not Rated, but contains some graphic violence and two brief sexual encounters.

Stick with the magnificent 1923 & 1956 and kid-friendly 1998 screen versions. Avoid this & 2007 screen versions like the Bubonic Plague.",1345852800,,3811,4.615384615384615

It did take a bit of artistic liberties but by the same token it made me feel the story of Moses and the journey through the wilderness in a more realistic fashion. Moses came through to me much more realistic than did Charlton Heston's portrayal, I felt the anguish, the reality that there was only one God, that it was a quest Moses didn't really want but felt lead to do. I just think all in all it put the whole thing in a much better perspective than I had ever given thought to before and was much more realistic (for me) than the '56 glitzy version. At least Moses LOOKED like he was wandering in the wilderness as did his followers, I also could understand how his faith took hold and grew.

THE ACTORS
Dougray Scott (who plays Moses) does an excellent job at portraying him. His acting in this movie is impeccable. Naveen Andrews (who plays Menerith) is also a fine actor. Omar Sharif who plays Jethro does a wonderful job. Paul Rhys does a really good job at playing the evil and stubborn Ramses
On the other hand, Padma Lakshmi's acting (who played Princess Bithia) was lackluster at times.

THE CINEMATOGRAPHY
The cinematography was exquisite. The photography and special effects were great especially for the parting of the sea. This movie stands up to the quality of other non-religious movies in Hollywood.

2510554,5,B000E97HXK,"There is another copy of this film, release one year later with different artwork. As far as I can determine there is no difference between the two, running time and extras are unchanged. The picture and sound quality, wide-screen presentation is identical. We were so impressed with this telling of the story of Moses, that we played it again two nights later. I can say we were impressed with the quality of the production including locations, sets, costume, script/story/dialogue, special effects, and actors. If asked sum up our families overall impression in one word, I would say, ""realistic"". It is very detailed in its presentation, and sticks closer to the biblical accounts than any other film of Moses. The scenery, sets, costumes I mention are much more authentic than what I have seen in the past. I do not mean expensive, or glamorous like an epic film, just very realistic.

But the writing of the characters is where the movie really excelled. The lead actors and supporting cast take their parts and pull it together with their performances, but there is so much depth and humanity in the way their parts are written. You really get a sense of joy, suffering, betrayal, faith, love and so much more. The part of Moses in not portrayed as a beloved all powerful leader. He has tremendous fear at times, and is burdened non-stop with the stress of leading his people, who are very difficult to lead. Many are the times he is tearful and in pain, begging God to release him of his burden. At one point after the people had broken a promise to the Lord, Moses orders his people that had been living under Egyptian rule for over 900 years to make weapons and learn to fight their way across the desert, and they did. It is not glamorous war but a bloody desperate struggle.

There are portions of the scripture included here that other films shy away from, such as when Moses has a large number of the people killed for breaking a promise to obey the Lords commands. Those that refused to admit this was wrong, ask for forgiveness and swear their allegiance to God were stoned and speared to death. It has the scene where Moses sweetens a poison spring, through Gods instruction. Not to say this movie is all inclusive or completely accurate, no film I have seen yet based on any book ever is, much less biblical movies. Consider that there are 4 books in the bible to tell the story of Moses being Exodus, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Leviticus.

Aaron was his spokesperson in the bible - but here Moses is giving inspirational speeches and Aaron is no where to be seen while in another part  Moses actually tells the Israelites to rely on themselves during a battle instead of telling them that God will win the battle! This is preposterous if not blasphemy!

Additionally, the movie omits the reasons WHY things were happening - why the plagues, why they are fighting the Amalekites, why is Moses holding the staff up during a battle, etc. If I didn't already know the story, I'd be somewhat lost concerning the plot.

The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it fails to capture WHY one would be inspired to follow this (portrayal of) cruel, distant God - it utterly fails to capture the certainty of hearing and knowing and trusting God that would lead millions out of Egypt and fails to capture His tenderness and goodness and care. This would not inspire anyone to love, trust or obey God, nor even want to know Him better at all! As one reviewer wrote - see the movie 'Moses' starring Ben Kingsley - much better script and direction.

collection of movies that pertain to religion. This movie is not a video version of the Book of Exodus, Dougray Scott is not Charleton Heston, and

there are some interesting deviations from the Bible in this miniseries

called the Ten Commandments. Still, I enjoyed it. I am a Christian and a

Roman Catholic. I think I'm fairly devout, but who is keeping score?

  I found myself actually GLAD this wasn't an attempt to remake

DeMille or TBS...the special effects for TV were pretty interesting.

Some interesting questions came to mind for me on my spiritual journey

as i viewed the film. I appreciated that. If I wanted a video version of the Bible, I'd look elsewhere. I don't think any harm was done by some license taken by the director and screen writers with the story.

I have always thoughtof Moses as much more complex then Heston or even Kingsley played him. He is more the prophet here, even tortured inside and we see him struggle, which a person does when he is called by God.

  There is a parallel being depicted of Moses and Christ which is compelling for me, anyway...Pershaps offensive to others. I liked that.

The film seemed to explore many questions, and my only complaint was that it was too short...even ""hurried"" at the end. There is so much that happenned after the Golden Calf...yet we jump from there to Moses

having to view the Promised Land from a mountain...Silly.

  It's not enough of a flaw not to recommend it anyway, so long as you

don't mind anything that doesn't ""literally"" depict a book of the Bible.

Some reviewing preceding me seemed offended by that. I don't think anyone will or has watched it and lost their faith or gone to hell.

How do we really know what Moses was like as a person or what he went through inside. The movie doesn't claim to be totally factual or pretend to be any more than Demille.

Moshe Rabbeinu was the most humble prophet who spoke directly to Hashem. The portrayal as a maniacal bumbler did not do justice to Moshe at all. Several of the scenes deviated from the Torah including the portions of Yisro and the story of the Golden Calf.

There are elements of this movie that make it worthwhile.  So few movie adaptations of Bible stories turn out particularly well.

Unfourtunantely this is yet another Non-Biblical movie ""about the Bible"". It simply takes a basic outline of the Biblical story and slaps an entirely different message into it. I was appalled at how faithless, rebelious and unbelieving Moses, Aaron and Miriam were portrayed. Moses is sadly made out to be an arrogant, tempermental, self-willed and hypocritical man who continually displays unbelief and brazen defiance against God Almighty. He acts as though he were on equal ground with God and had every right and desire to argue against Him.  As though God were a mere man and had no higher understanding or substancial authority. This is far from the Biblical Moses who was a humble and meek man who feared God and was obedient to His command - a righteous man, full of faith. It is not possible that the things that come out of this movie Moses' mouth would ever had exited the mouth of the real/Biblical Moses. Thankfully it is not in the nature of a Spirit filled, Bible Believing Christian to think or act as these characters do. If  you know and love the Gospel of Jesus Christ, this movie will not (and can not) refresh the Spirit within you.

Better to watch Cecil B DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"" with Charlton Heston - it may add plenty of 'fill in the detail' scenes which are not Biblically historical but it is doctrinally unoffending and overall a good and fun Bible movie. (if there are any serious doctrinal errors in it I do not recall them at present)

2510587,2,B000E97HXK,"The only good thing about this movie was the special effects involved in the parting of the sea of reeds.  Indeed, this was well done.

The acting, direction, and the script was an absolute abomination from the reference point of any reasonable level of inspection.

Now, I know that artistic license is usually taken in the production of such a movie, but if one wants to make a movie that involves some made-up items added to the actual story, then he should at least make it interesting and meaningful.

You want to see a good movie?  Then see 'Moses' starring Ben Kingsley.",1171670400,8,577,4.617647058823529
