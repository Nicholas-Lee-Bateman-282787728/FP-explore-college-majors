8362448,2,B002BXIEV6,"Focuses too much on negativity.  Life is not about relinquishing our power.  Life is about empowering ourselves. To the point that
anger rules our lives; we have succumbed.",1380412800,,172,5.107142857142857
8362449,5,B002BXIEV6,Very informative movie.  A bit scarey to think about but probably true.  I would like to watch it again very soon!,1365465600,,114,4.380952380952381
8362450,3,B002BXIEV6,"good documentary, as usual david ickes holds nothing back good topics ,but as usual remember to look into the facts and acess the info",1353974400,,134,4.625

the light of current events!",1353542400,,105,4.3
8362452,1,B002BXIEV6,If anyone thinks this book is the best they are fooling themselves.  Obama is a closet Marxist and is NOT GOING to save this nation.  This must be a joke.,1309132800,4,154,4.1
8362453,5,B002BXIEV6,"If you do not know who David Icke is, you should get to know him. My favorite book of his, is ""Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is an Illusion."" What a title! What a message! If more humans shared the message, we would not be trying to dominate and kill everybody.",1288828800,13,280,4.203703703703703
8362454,5,B002BXIEV6,"Those who know David Icke and those who don't will be delighted with this video. Apart from the usual reptiles doomsday stuff, Host Ron James takes the information in a  new direction.  Icke obliges by sharing the vision that even if all of the conspiracies are true, we as people really do have control, and this is truly our time to shine.
Another review here on Amazon mentions missing features, the publisher told me that the DVD was upgraded as per Icke's web site, and that Amazon still had the previous version, which is now long since gone.  The DVD I bought had all the bonus features, including Joshua P. Warren and Jim Marrs on vaccines.  What a great collection!",1265932800,29,674,4.591666666666667
8362455,5,B002BXIEV6,David Icke followers and newbies will appreciate this interview.  He tells it like it is,1255132800,6,88,4.866666666666666
8362456,2,B002BXIEV6,"I ordered this from Amazon because they often have a product at a little cheaper cost than the original company.  The original company sells this item at a special price for 17.99 from Ickes web site.  On Icke's site, they report that bonus features include Jim Marrs, Joshua P. Warren, Renegade Agent, and Icke's son.  The DVD I received from Amazon has no bonus materials (one of the reasons I wanted the DVD)and states at the end of the DVD that "" this DVD is a work in progress"".  I wonder if this is a pirated copy without the Bonus material.  Also, the DVD did not play well.  I had to watch it on my computer and even then had some trouble with it stalling.  Buy from Icke's site if you want this DVD.",1254096000,21,708,4.2388059701492535
