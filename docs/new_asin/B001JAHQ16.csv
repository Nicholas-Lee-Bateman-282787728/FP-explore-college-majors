in the ER as it is!!!!!!!!!!!! Not too long.",1266364800,,114,3.7916666666666665
3653722,5,B001JAHQ16,"I really love E.R., it is definetly one of my all time favorite t.v. shows. I plan on purchasing all of the box sets as they become available. This season(12), marks a real change in County Hospital, I think. Noah Wylie (Dr. John Carter) has left to go to Africa to be with his love, Kem, and Dr. Luca Kovac is now in charge. I really enjoyed most of the episodes in this season, and am anxious to see what season 13 holds in store. I've not seen any of the episodes after this season, so 13-15 is all new to me, as I was always working on Thursday nights when the episodes originally aired, and syndication hasn't shown many, if any of season 13.
I do wish they would go ahead and release the next three box sets sooner, seein that E.R. is no longer on network t.v. Oh, well, patience is a virtue, huh?!",1265673600,4,804,4.160256410256411
3653723,5,B001JAHQ16,"ER was one of the best on TV... But leave it to NBC to take off a great show and put trash in its place. And that is just what they did.
Yes so of this years ER is a bit slow and all. But it is all part of the story line. I will get them all on DVD just as I have been doing.
I will hit Best buy Tue AM. and get season 12.
Be well all.....",1263081600,2,339,3.25
3653724,4,B001JAHQ16,"I agree with many of the reviews about the Africa episodes, but I think they are vital to the storyline of John Carter.  This is where he meets his wife, she gets pregnant, and they have to make the decision to go back to Chicago for the baby.  Although some of the episodes may be boring, and yes, there didn't need to be quite so many of them, they are a necessity for Carter's background.  These episodes give us insight into the humanity of Carter and his desire to help those outside of Chicago County General.  Great show, not the best season, but vital to the development of characters and the last three seasons of the show.",1262822400,3,632,4.3760683760683765
3653725,3,B001JAHQ16,"I've always been a big fan of ER. I am currentrly collecting all of the seasons I now have 1-9 and hope to aquire 9-12 and then 13-15 when they become available. Like the other revievers have said the ""Africa"" eposods really add nothing of value to the show. If ""DR. Carter"" wanted to leave the show the writers should have elimated his role insted of contuining with going back abd forth betewwn Africa and chichago. despite a few negativies I was always and will always be an avid ER fan so I intend to continue collecting every season",1262476800,3,537,4.434343434343434
3653726,2,B001JAHQ16,"I love ER, I plan on getting every season but these Africa episodes are BOOOOOOOOORING and like one of the other reviewers said, adds NOTHING to the season or the flow of ANY story line, I have watched all of these africa episodes in previous seasons but I was easily distracted around the house when they were on with no regrets whatsoever, this is why this season gets a 2 star rating even before it's even released.

My Girl and I hate these Africa Episodes and will be glad when they no longer exist on an ER season disc set but they are no problem for her.........they put her right to sleep.",1261958400,3,597,4.330357142857143
3653727,5,B001JAHQ16,"Love ER?  I haven't received it yet, but of course I've seen every episode.

The holder for the DVDs is well made and stores the DVDs well.",1255910400,,139,4.111111111111111
3653728,4,B001JAHQ16,Not as good as some of the earlier ones - but still a good ER run.,1255910400,,66,3.1875
3653729,3,B001JAHQ16,"ER had some ups and downs it's last five seasons, and this was the lowest point. Why? I can sum 90% of it up in one word: Africa.

After leaving the show in the season 11 finale, it was announced that Noah Wyle would return for several episodes in season 12. That sounded great...at first.
Then the episodes aired, and it was more of Dr. Carter in Africa. The writer's already made their points with this storyline in season 10. The Africa episodes in season 12 simply don't add anything to the story, and are just more of the same.
Granted, none of these Africa episodes are as bad as ""Makemba"" from season ten, but
they still consume too much of season 12.

And now for the other 10% of the problems.

There is an episode in the first half of the season callled ""dream House"", and it is probobly the worst non-Africa episode of the series. It focuses on Abby and Neela treating a baby Monkey. There were other occasions where animals were treated in the ER, but this case takes up too much time and lacks effective exectution.
Also, the season premiere was weak.

Now, for what I did like:

Kristen Johnston (I'm not sure if I got her name right) and John Leguizamo all have good recurring roles, and James Woods is excellent in an episode where he plays
a former teacher of Abby's, who has ALS. Woods received a well deserved emmy nomination for this role.

There is an excellent storyline where Kovac treats a woman who emerges from a coma after several years, and on a personal note he and Abby's relationship was rekindled.

There are some other good patient storylines (an Islamic girl is the victim of an honor killing, a child used as a human shield by her abductor, etc) and Scott Grimes becomes a regular cast member, which I wasn't happy about at first, but starting with the season finale and continuing through the remainder of the series, Dr. Archie Morris became (in my opinion) one of the best charachters of the series.

One last thing I want to discuss is the season finale, 21 Guns. This is a polarizing episode among ER fans. It caused many to tune out for good, while causing others to wait at the edge of their seat for the season 13 premiere. I was somewhere in the middle. After twelve seasons, the show had already done so much gunplay in the hospital that this finale pushed believeability. However, it was an intense way of pushing some tired old storylines out of the way (Sam's ex-boyfriend) while paving the way for a strong start to season 13 (and some fresh storylines) I personally believe in it's fifteen years on the airway, ER did stretch believeability when it came to gunfights in the hospital, but compared to some other popular shows, I don't think this was even close to the worse
case of stretching reality (24's Jack Bauer couldn't possibly survive everything the writer's have thrown at him, and Meredith on Grey's Anatomy would've died in the Ferry accident episode (and no, I don't watch Grey's Anatomy).

I will definately be adding season 12 to my collection, but I see much of it as merely a bridge to better seasons.",1254268800,34,3067,4.541666666666667

Overall, felt like it was worth the purchase, but could have been better and maybe cost a bit too much for what I got.  The season finale is very tense and exciting, but pushed believably a bit and had waaaaay too many of the cast involved in various dramas.  It felt overwhelming, and I wish they had split those stories up somehow so that there could be more tension for each individual character.",1476316800,,536,4.53125

3653777,4,B001JAHQ16,ER languished for a couple seasons with turgid plot lines which focused too often on one or two characters to the exception of medical problems. It became almost 'House-like' in that the characters were the plot not the situations. Some episodes were nearly unwatchable. Luckily it got back on tract in its 6th and 7th seasons.,1459209600,,327,4.857142857142857

3653833,5,B001JAHQ16,"There are six major milestones that make this season stand out. The first is that Dr. Susan Lewis leaves the show in the first episode. Her role was never strong. Her two best episodes are the two where she leaves. The second is the season long guest appearance of John Leguizamo as Dr. Victor Clemente as a hot shot resident. The third is the episode devoted exclusively to a patient played by James Woods, as a leading researcher who arrives in the final stages of Lou Gerhig's disease (ALS), with lots of flashbacks covering the time when the disease first appeared, and as it progressed. The fourth is the appearance of Kristen Johnston as Nurse Manager Eve Peyton (Kristen Johnston was a regular, and Emmy award winner for ""Third Rock from the Sun""). The fifth was the appearance of John Stamos (He becomes a regular next season.). The sixth is the arc with Linda Cardel.ini  and guest star Armand Assante.

I also enjoy the episodes where Laura Innes has a major role. She always seems like a more realistic Chief of Staff than Lisa Edelstein's role as Dr. House's boss on ""House"". She goes through a life changing arc in this season.

This season is a turning point for Dr. Archie Morris, who began on the show as a lazy and not very sharp intern. He is now part of the main cast, and will remain there for the remaining seasons.

There are more cases of musical chairs in romantic attachments between members of the ER staff. With some exceptions, this may be my least favorite part of ""ER"" from the first season. It seems that practically every major character deals with some kind of romantic or professional crisis this season. There are some episodes where scenes take place in Darfur, with Dr. Carter, but thankfully, they are brief.",1390176000,4,1746,4.640776699029126
3653834,5,B001JAHQ16,"This season is great. Always fast paced and dramatic. The characters change, but the story line remains the same: Save lives amid the chaos of the ER, and hold your own life in balance.

I realize casting changes and all that but they certainly woudldn't plug in a different actor for one of the doctors and pretend it was the same person.  Why do it with a child?  It got in the way of the whole ""left home to find Dad"" drama for me.

I'm another one who didn't watch ER when it was on TV and overall I'm enjoying the series. It does seem to be a lot less interesting than the earlier seasons with the earlier crew. I almost gave up on it actually but enjoyed season 11, decided to get the rest.

I won't give anything away, but they've gone from interesting characters with interesting interactions and medicines to randomly assigning tragedies to characters to try and squeeze drama out of an otherwise uninteresting cast.

*Roll Roll Roll* Cancer for Dr. X!
*Roll Roll Roll* Death for Dr. Y!
*Roll Roll Roll* Crazy Family/Ex for Dr. Z!
*Roll Roll Roll* AFRICA!

You get the impression that the writers have just run out of ideas and are now flailing about and trying to keep things from utter monotony.

3653862,5,B001JAHQ16,"I loved these late seasons BECAUSE of the Africa and Iraq storylines. I don't totally understand all the complaining on these reviews. I am so glad they tell stories with Doctors Without Borders. It made me feel inspired. Network TV doesn't always do that for a girl, you know.",1334275200,,277,4.673469387755102
3653863,4,B001JAHQ16,"I never watched ER when it was on TV as it came on in the 10PM time slot which was a little late for me. Starting at Season 1, I am now up to Season 12. This is my least favorite season. Like many of you, I don't see the point of switching back and forth to Africa. I miss John Carter in the ER, but would rather have seen him occasionally in a different setting. Some of the new characters add nothing to the story line either, such as Dr Morris( he's just an annoyance),and Dr Albright(she's an over-confident tyrant). Still, I will keep watching until the end. There aren't many shows like this one, and unfortunately, the TV networks are now  focusing on the inane...such as all the dance shows ( enough, already !), and the so-called 'reality' shows aren't any better. I rent old TV shows, or movies to watch so I can see quality TV that I enjoy.",1334188800,2,851,4.253086419753086
3653864,5,B001JAHQ16,"I am not an ER regular, however, I started watching because of Shane West's character (Dr. Ray Barnett).  I started with Season 11 and became obsorbed with the series so far.  The casting is suberb and the story lines are excellent.  I not only am intrigued with West, but I absolutely am fastinated with the other characters I've watched.  ER is one of the Best shows I didn't have the sense to watch but am not catching up on.  I have since watched Season 12, which I have to say is excellent and I have just ordered Season 13.",1327536000,,529,4.303030303030303

8312309,3,B001JAHQ16,"This season begins on the wrong side of a jumped shark. We see Kristen Johnson, John Stamos, John Leguizamo and Paula Malcomson added to the cast. Next season we get Stanley Tucci. Each of these characters stays just long enough to eff up the ER and/or the life of an ER staffer, and then is gone like poof. Stamos is a soap and comic actor, so he adapts well to motivational switches that simply don't occur in regular humans (and should signal an organic cause, needing tests). Leguizamo is a loud, lucky loose cannon whose luck eventually runs out. None of the new women even lasts two full seasons. But we get some outsize acting from everyone.

Show-wise, Abby and Kovac get knocked up, Weaver gets a new hip, Gallant gets hit hard by the war, and Pratt gets dragged to Darfur by Carter in cameo. Sam and Neela get NO help with their hair. Ray gets involved with jailbait, played by Kat Dennings. Morris and Dubenko get more annoying to prove that's possible. Only nurses Chuny and Malik offer longtime viewers any stability or connection to the show this once was, and they don't even get promotions.

Finally, these Evel Knievels of casting bring in Garrett Freaking Dillahunt, a go-to Crazy Dude, in the role of Sam's babydaddy, who viewers previously met as a loser but not a total psycho - played by another actor. Not sure if the original actor was unavailable, inconvenient or just forgotten.

In other news, this was the year Grey's Anatomy came out.",1503705600,,1463,4.640926640926641
