I own all the videos of Michael Bolton except for the Live in Catania, which is all of the Arias and I am still trying to find this video to buy.  Michaels ""voice"" is a voice that cannot be imitated.  He has such a unique voice, and sings with such passion, that any song he sings makes that song come alive, along with being such an awsome songwriter.  I also own all of Michael's CD's, each album that he records just seems to get better than the last it's hard to pick out any single one that is better than the other. If you don't have any of these videos or CD's, you should get them, you will enjoy them until you almost wear them out.  If you haven't heard his last CD ""Vintage"" you need to get it.  He really does justice to these great songs, it is just a wonderful album.",1085356800,,820,4.09375
