2886408,4,B000SK5ZFM,"I just love cheap old movies (old genre movies) like the ones I grew up watching at the Drive-Ins. This collection of old Vincent Price movies is so much fun! I was searching for some old Dr. Phibes movies and ending up buying the collection, which including several additional movies as well. These are great old movies that should not be taken too seriously, just enjoyed. I highly recommend these. They are fairly inexpensive and I feel you will enjoy them.",1192838400,5,460,4.691358024691358
2886409,5,B000SK5ZFM,"as much as I hate flipper discs, this set is still a great bargain.

Now, please bring back Price's other Poe AIP films since they are out-of-print!

2886410,3,B000SK5ZFM,"For those Price fans who already own his prior DVD film releases, note that only Witchfinder General is a new transfer to DVD.  The other film transfers are from previously released editions.  And as such, Twice Told Tales, Theater of Blood, and Madhouse are in letterbox format, not anamorphic.  So if you already have these films, Dr. Phibes and Tales of Terror on DVD you only need to buy Witchfinder General separately, you'll get nothing else new here.  Fox cleverly fails to disclose the format of its DVDs by calling everything ""widescreen"" whether or not the films were processed in letterbox or anamorphic formats.  Its a huge difference for those of us with HDTVs.  What an opportunity lost for remastering these horror classics.",1189900800,70,739,4.967479674796748
2886411,5,B000SK5ZFM,"Ignore the carping here about the thin-sleeve packaging of this set (an asset, anyway, to some of us with large DVD collections and limited shelf space) -- these classic British horror films at a bargain price are worth grabbing!  The PHIBES pair and THEATRE OF BLOOD are models of how to camp successfully on a low budget, with Diana Rigg, Coral Browne, Robert Morley and others joining Price to chew every piece of scenery in sight.  Screenplay, design, direction -- all great fun.  And WITCHFINDER GENERAL has been on many a DVD wish list for years.  Price never disappoints, never plays down to his material or his audience, is always full-steam-ahead, to good advantage.  If you know these movies, you'll jump for this set.  If you don't, check them out -- you'll be glad you did!",1189728000,11,785,4.735294117647059
2886412,4,B000SK5ZFM,I made an earlier review blasting the use of the slim line cases being used on this release and I deleted the review to up the Star Rating from 1 Star to 4 Since the release overal is so good. the films should have been housed in regular standard sized keep cases since these are feature films. Warner Bros was even using the slim line cases for a period of time on full length film releases and quickly stopped. Slim line cases are great for TV shows and the like but feature films deserve to be more presentable. So the films are great just Shame on Fox/MGM for the Use of the slim case.,1189468800,,589,4.175438596491228
2886413,5,B000SK5ZFM,"This set will contain seven of Vincent Price's better horror films of the 1960's and 1970's and even includes a bonus disc of extra features. MGM is no Warner Home Video when it comes to DVD boxed sets and extra features, but this one shows progress in that direction. The following are the details on the included films and extra features.

Abominable Dr. Phibes: Price gives a campy performance in one of the few horror films which successfully and intentionally joins comedy and horror. Joseph Cotten and Terry-Thomas are just two of the victims on whom Price seeks vengeance for his disfigurement and his wife's death. The Art Deco sets give the film a stylish look and the British deadpan delivery of many of the jokes helps immensely.

Dr. Phibes Rises Again: The disfigured madman (Price) is back as he and his deceased wife go boating down the Underground River of the Dead in this sequel to The Abominable Dr. Phibes. Once again, everybody is in it for the laughs including the set designer.

Tales of Terror - Three stories adapted very loosely from the work of Edgar Allen Poe -  ""Morella"", ""The Black Cat"" and ""The (Facts in the) Case of M. Valdemar"", each roughly one half-hour in length.

Twice Told Tales - This is a compilation of three short films based on Nathaniel Hawthorne works - Heidegger's Experiment, Rappaccini's Daughter and The House of Seven Gables. In both this film and ""Tales of Terror"", the idea is not so much to be true to the original story, as it is to use the foundation of the story to the advantage of Cormen's ability to make scary movies and in Price's ability to star in them.

Theater of Blood: An entertaining horror film about a demented Shakespearean actor (Price) who takes a bloody revenge against the eight theatre critics who gave his performances bad reviews. To me this one of Price's  often forgotten and most underrated films. He really hams it up and it works perfectly.

Madhouse: Price stars as an actor who returns to the screen to reprise his role as a killer a few years after his wife-to-be was decapitated by a killer nobody caught. Price is good as always, but it just seems a little tired and more like a tribute to his past and better films.

Witchfinder General (aka Conqueror Worm): In 17th-century England during the struggle between Cromwell and the Crown, Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price) and his associates seek out and persecute those thought to practice sorcery as well as anyone else who incurs their wrath. When Hopkins executes the priest of a small town for being a warlock, he and his partner find themselves the target of a young soldier who leaves his post in Cromwell's army to hunt down and kill the pair. The movie captures this period in  English history very well for a low-budget production. Price is at his menacing, sadistic best without the intentional camp that he injects in so many of his other horror films.

An extras disc will contain a documentary (""Vincent Price: Renaissance Man"") and two featurettes (""The Art of Fear"" and ""Working with Vincent Price""). The set will be available on September 11th.",1185408000,74,3097,4.737918215613383

2886448,5,B000SK5ZFM,"My primary interest in purchasing this Box Set, is I wanted to get the movie ""The Witch Finder General"" in the wide screen format.  The difference in price between the single movie D.V.D. & this Box Set was so close I couldn't justify getting the single D.V.D. & pass up having all these other great films on D.V.D. !!!  This is a well put together collection of Vincent Price movies!  When dealing with a actor as prolific as Vincent Price you could literally put together 10 box sets with 5 movies in each & only capture half of his body of work!!!  I believe in the documentary that comes in this set states he is credited in over 100 movies!  All the movies in this collection are either wide screen or letter boxed & in color giving you what you would have seen in the movie theater.  It also cleverly pairs the movies collected in this box set placing ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes "" along with its sequel "" The Abominable Dr. Phibes rises again"" two campy revenge classic's.  Edgar Allen Poe's ""Tales of Terror"" along with Nathanial Hawthorn's ""Twice told Tales"",  each film showcases 3 story's from these legendary contemporary author's of horror!  It also pairs ""Mad House"" with  "" Theater of Blood"" both films focusing around actor's, ""The Witch Finder General"" A unique Vincent Price Gem a bit different from his other works is paired with ""The special Features Disc"".  I appreciate the thought put into the arrangement & choice of films that went into this collection.  The quality is great in both audio & visual & is one of the better arrangements of movie selections offered in a box set.  This is a great way to start collecting Vincent Price films but you may want to start picking up double features to add to your collection to avoid repeating films.",1440806400,9,1766,4.603833865814696

2886483,4,B000SK5ZFM,"The M-G-M Scream Legends Collection of Vincent Price movies offers some of Price's classic films on this box set. Not necessarily his best movies, though there are two or three I feel in this box set, but movies we had come to expect from one of the true masters of horror. The thing about Vincent Price is even when it is not one of his better movies it is still a joy to watch just because of Price. I always felt that even when given a script that wasn't the best to work with Price still gave his best effort. That is why a bad Vincent Price movie is usually better then a lot of good movies by other actors.

In this box set we are given seven of Vincent's films from the 60's and 70's. In addition there is a disc on the movies of Vincent Price as well as his life outside of films. I won't go into a run down of every single movie in the set but of note the better movies I feel that appear in the set include ""Tales Of Terror"". Three stories that were written by Edger Allan Poe are put together in one movie. This has always been one of my favorites of Vincent Price movies and includes appearences by Peter Lorre and Basil Rathbone. ""The Abominable Dr Phibes"" is another good one and remains to this day among Vincent's fan as one of their favorite movies. The third one of note might also be the best among the bunch, ""Witchfinder General"" also known as ""The Conqueror Worm"". This movies rates up there with ""House Of Wax"" and ""The Masque Of The Red Death"" as the best work Vincent Price ever did.

You can't go wrong getting this if you love horror movies that doesn't come with all the blood and gore that horror movies of today offer. Yeah the horror might be lame by todays standards but unlike todays horror films you get a plot and character development with these movies. Of course if you are a Vincent Price fan then you got to get this because... well because it is Vincent Price! What other reason do you need.",1325030400,3,1931,4.244565217391305

2886488,4,B000SK5ZFM,"I personally love the MGM Midnite Movie imprint for some great to not so great horror and cult offerings from the 60s and 70s. In particular the Vincent Price two packs are wonderful, especially for a 30-something like myself who has just fallen for Mr. Price and can't wait to make it through a good chunk of his flicks. This set is affordable and the overall picture and sound quality is great, what more can you really ask for?  This set collects some of Price's most memorable films from the later years in his long career, and it showcases not only the best but some of the worst as well.

Madhouse is basically a horror infused send up of Price's own film career. He plays an actor named Paul Tombs who is best know for staring in a series of gruesome horror flicks all surrounding the character Dr. Death. At the height of his career as the gruesome doctor, Tombs finally decided to settle down and marry one of his leading ladies, the announcement of which he made at a gala New Years party with all of his friends and colleagues. Unfortunately not everyone is so happy with his impending nuptials and ends up killing his bride to be (beheading her in fact), though the question is raised, did Tombs kill her himself. After a lengthy hiatus from film making (not to mention a stay in an asylum) Tombs decides to re-embark on his film career at the behest of his best friend and co-creator of Dr. Death Herbert Flay (played by the ever awesome Peter Cushing.) Of course, straight away the bodies start piling up again, as do the questions as to who is killing all of these people.

At then end of the day I really enjoyed the first two thirds of the film, but it really suffered from an almost incomprehensible climax and resolution. It didn't help that the film was filled with plot holes and some questionable directing (way too many red herrings, a fact that is actually celebrated in the final act with an actual dish of red herring.) Price and Cushing do their best with what they have, even though their effort barely rescues this film from complete disaster. At a time when the modern horror landscape was drastically changing, and surrounded by the likes of Black Christmas, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, and Last House on the left, flicks like Madhouse with their questionable effects work (many obviously rubber spiders abound) and poorly written scripts just a little past their day.

Theatre of Blood on the other hand takes a nice cue from the Dr. Phibes movies in both it's overall plot structure and tone, though it feels more in tune with the turning tide of the realistic horror output of the day (whereas the Phibes films feel more like his Corman Poe work from earlier, more theatrical.) Price plays Richard Lionheart, a dedicated Shakespearean thespian who decides to extract revenge against the critics who had slammed his beloved performances time and time again.

Witchfinder General (though American audiences might know it as The Conqueror Worm), released in 1968, is probably one of his better performances int he set as well as being the most disturbing of his career.  In this flick Price plays Mathew Hopkins, a lawyer and professional witch finder/executor, a character that's based on an actual witch inquisitor.  While making his way through England torturing and executing ""confessed"" witches (whether they are guilty or not), Hopkins is summoned to a small town at the behest of the populace to look into a local priest.  It just so happens that the priest is the uncle of Sarah Lowes, whose fianc (Richard Marshall, played by Ian Ogilvy) is a Roundhead fighting against the Royalists.  After Hopkins tortures and executes Sarah's uncle Richard comes back to find his soon to be wife in quite a state (she had offered herself to Hopkins in exchange for her uncle's safety and was inadvertently raped by Hopkins' assistant in the process.)  Richard vows revenge on Hopkins, stopping at nothing to see him pay for what he's done.

The film was very well made with a startlingly non-camp performance from Price (a feat which young auteur director Michael Reeves accomplished by constantly questioning Price's acting choices unexplained to a point where Price ended up reeling in his typical black humor.)  The film was pretty brutal for the time, and much more so than Price seems to typically make.  I think it's because the material was handle very realistically and straight forward with no actual witchcraft or crazy plot devices.  I was also surprised by the very downbeat ending, also a rarity in Price's oeuvre.

Both Dr. Phibes films are also presented in all of their artistic over the top camp glory.  In these Price is Phibes, an amalgamation of a number of his past screen personas mixed into one calm monster out for revenge.  It's hard to describe the flicks without giving away too much, but these are a very nice example of methodical, theatrical, and well researched revenge plots that believe it or not cement the cinematic base for films like Se7en to be built upon.

Also included are a couple of the later entries in the Poe/Hawthorne adaptation series started by AIP, Roger Corman, and Mr. Price.  Twice Told Tales and Tales of Terror are anthology flicks with some great performances from Price, Peter Lorre, and Basil Rathbone.

Overall this is a nice selection that showcases Price at his best and worst towards the end of his career.  There's also a nice bonus disc that features a look into Price's life, his love of art and food and his ever gracious philanthropy.  Totally worth the price of admission...",1244678400,3,5596,4.765253360910031

It features 6 definitive Price masterworks and 1 extremely flawed sequel in addition to a disc of bonus features paying homage to the most impressive career in all of horror cinema.  His unique delivery and amazing voice could be used to chill to he bone or purely for camp. No actor has ever had a more distinctive screen presence, and none should be more revered by fans of the horror genre.  The man appeared in at least 179 films and television series beginning in 1938, making the leap to horror icon in 1953's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Wax/dp/B00009NHBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Wax</a>.  From that point on, Price became a horror fixture starring in classics including (but not limited to)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fly/dp/B000RXVNDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fly</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-on-Haunted-Hil/dp/B001BSBBGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House on Haunted Hil</a>&nbsp;along with the original (and best) adaptation pf Richard Matheson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>, entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B001BSBBNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>.  Sadly, none of those films are featured in this set, but many of the lesser-known (see: not remade yet) gems of his career are so fear not.  While Price's onscreen persona was often villainous, menacing, and dour in real life he had a great sense of humor, once starting an eggfight on the set of Adam West's camp classic television series ""Batman"" where he played the villain Egghead.  He was also known as a gracious and humble man to work with who always answered every piece of fan mail he received personally.  There is no other person I'd personally rather see onscreen, there is no life form who did more for horror cinema in the 50's and 60's, and as far as I'm concerned there was never a better onscreen presence then Vincent Price.  Now, allow me to break down the individual films in this fantastic boxed set.

Edgar Allen Poe's ""Tales of Terror"" is an anthology of three tales taken from the macabre poet's catalog and brought to life by Vincent Price and director Roger Corman.  If there is one thing that even the most mathematically-challenged horror fan knows it's Poe + Price = awesome.  ""Morella"" is a chilling tale about a woman reuniting with the recluse father who abandoned her out of grief after losing his wife during childbirth. Naturally, there is a supernatural aspect and the reunion turns out less then great for father and daughter alike.  ""The Black Cat"" has been adapted many times with this one being the most comedic, but also arguably the most entertaining.  Frequent Price collaborator Peter Lorre plays a drunk whose hatred for his wife's cat will eventually be his undoing.  Price himself plays the wine connoisseur who bangs said wie after a hilarious taste-off featuring the horror legend at his hamiest.  ""The Fact s in the Case of M. Valdemar"" is the strongest of the three and terrifying indeed.  The story is of a man who finds that a person can be trapped in a state between life and death indefinitely through hypnosis after he entrances a man on his deathbed.  Insistent on interviewing the man -who can still communicate through a kind of telepathy- about his afterlife experiences indefinitely, the hypnotist ignores his and his wife's pleas to be released from his awful state.  The climax is horrifying and fitting.
4 stars

On the flipside of very same disc we have ""Twice-Told Tales"", another anthology.  This one takes three tales from Nathaniel Hawthorne's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/short-story-collection/dp/0375757880/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">short story collection</a>&nbsp;of the same name.  That's SIX horror classic on the very first disc in this collection. Worth the price of the set by itself, really.  ""Heidegger's Experiment"" is a tale of betrayal that centers around two old friends who are made young again when they discover a fountain of youth of sorts.  But when they use it to bring back the love of their lives, the old cliche ""be careful what you wish for"" is in full effect.  ""Rappacini's Daughter"" is the story of a man who infects his daughter with a deadly poison that assures no man can ever touch her.  But a grown woman needs more then her father and the story of a girl who kills everything she touches is a tragic one.  ""The House of Seven Gables"" actually drags on quite a bit, but is still worth watching.  It's a typical story of greed and the sins of the father that revolves around a fortune hidden in a family's cursed ancestral home that was stolen from them by another family.  People from both clans show up to claim the hidden treasure, but nobody's going home happy.
3  stars

""Theater of Blood"" is a favorite Price flick of mine.  It's both scary in it's way and absurdly humorous and pays tribute to William Shakespeare every step of the way.  Price plays a deranged actor robbed of his perceived rightful prize at an award show by a panel of judges, who gave the award to an upstart.  I see the film as a tongue-in-cheek message to film critics to respect their betters.  He begins slaughtering the critics by staging famous death scenes from Shakespeare plays with himself providing the performances and a crew of fans (and paid bums) taking care of the logistics.  The cracked performances that result evoke more than a few laughs.  I'll never get the image of Price in a baker's hat re-enacting ""Titus Andronicus"" -where a queen is fed her own children in a pie- by feeding an effeminate man his beloved poodles using a funnel.  There is also trampoline fencing, an afro, and a reference to Price's character's performance betwixt two up-and-coming actors as being reminiscent of a ham sandwich.  The whole thing is like something out of some insane comic book.
5 stars

""Madhouse"" is on the flipside of the same disc, and is sort of a tribute to Price himself.  It features several classic clips from his filmography which are attributed here to his character Paul Toomes, whose trademark role is as the murderous Doctor Death.  Along with Peter Cushing, Robert Quarry co-stars in this and actually appears at a Halloween party dressed as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Count-Iorga/dp/B0007R4T0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Count Iorga</a>, which is a very funny treat for 70's horror fans.  Naturally, the troubled Toomes starts having people die around him in ways similar to his movies and it seems that his Doctor Death alter-ego has taken on a life of his own.  Great Price film.
4  stars

 ""The Abominable Doctor Phibes"" is a revered Price classic and with good reason.  It follows the ingenious murders of the title character, who is bent on revenge after his wife dies during a botched surgery.  There were nine members of the surgery team when she died and he creatively uses the ten plagues of Egypt to see that they meet their end with the help of his mute vision of beauty, Vulnavia (Virginia North).  Phibes himself cannot speak save for a device he invented that he plugs into his neck that allows him to vocalize using a phonograph.  Hearing Price's bone-chilling voice coming from a character whose lips never move is pretty discomforting, as is his silent surveillance of his handiwork.  The deaths in this are sweet and so is the music.  Phibe's flamboyant organ-playing and mechanized accompaniment (Dr. Phibe's Clockwork Wizards) also add a unique ambience to the proceedings.  The moment where Phibes reveals his true face is one of my favorite moments from a horror film.
 5 stars

On the other end of the spectrum (and the other side of the disc) is the lame sequel ""Doctor Phibes Rises Again"", which strikes me as a creatively bankrupt cash-in.  Any logic or originality from the first film quickly evaporates and the viewer is treated to all sorts of stupidity.  First off, Vulnavia is summoned out of thin air and is played by a different (no less alluring) actress.  No explanation.  Secondly, Phibes sets up his hideout complete with clockwork band IN AN EGYPTIAN PYRAMID.  Why?  Then there's the fact that Phibes ""talks"" constantly.  Any creepiness from the usually mute character vanishes the second he plugs his speech device into a freaking tuba held by Vulnavia. One starts to wonder how Phibes rolls his R's so well when he is speaking without using his tongue. When there is no tuba handy, we are forced to listen to his thoughts.  It becomes very annoying.  There are plenty of kills, and Robert Quarry co-stars as Phibe's rival to obtain the secret of the pharaoh's immortality so it's still mandatory viewing, but there is just too much ridiculousness in ""Doctor Phibes Rises Again"" to let it rise past the level of mediocre.  There were originally more sequels planned.  Thank God they never got made.
2  stars

""Witchfinder General"" may not be the best-known film in this set, but it arguably the most significant.  Butchered and released in America as ""The Conqueror Worm"" in a weak attempt to tie it to Edgar Allen Poe.  In fact, the DVD case still bafflingly reads ""Edgar Allen Poe's Witchfinder General"". Anyhow, this is the real deal uncut version complete with original score and it is wonderful. It was possibly the 60's film that inspired the 70's grindhouse era of horror cinema.  It is considered the most brutal horror picture produced in it's time and is certainly an integral part of any Vincent Price collection. Price's ice-cold performance as real-life witchhunter Matthew Hopkins is unique and was inspired by wonderkid director Michael Reeve's animosity towards the star during shooting. Not only does this film feature women being raped, hanged, drowned, beaten, tortured, and burned alive, but it also has a blunt axe murder that has to be seen to be believed. The tale is of a very uncomfortable and corrupt period in British history, and the view is very unpleasant as a whole.  Definitely not a typical Price flick. The scary thing is, no film has ever dared to examine the true extent of the evils brought about by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malleus-Maleficarum/dp/1585090980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malleus Maleficarum</a>.  Let's just say that the torture and live burnings seen in films are sugar-coated compared to the even more sadistic reality.  Mankind is a very sick species.  The disc features a commentary and a lengthy featurette on the making of the film.
5 stars

So that's it: the man, the myth, the legend, and a whole bunch of his films.  Also included in the set is the ""Disc of Horrors"" which features three excellent featurettes (about an hour total) about Vincent Price's life, times, friends, and films with one focusing on the films in this set.  All-in-all a hell of a deal.  If you don't already own these films, now's the time.  And while I'm here let me point out that it's a crime that there is still no DVD release for ""Diary of a Madman"".  Happy Haunting!",1241395200,9,11841,5.450905101481075
2886490,5,B000SK5ZFM,"My favorite by far is the Dr. Phibes movies.  My God! I never even in my most evil moment have thought of disposing of an enemy is the ways Dr. Phibes does.  Does it rate five starts.  Of course not.  But I do not want to piss off Dr Phibes so I will give him the benefit of a doubt.  Other than the fact that it is a probably one of the worse movies you could recommend to some one you do not know.  It is a great escape.  If you want to get really technical it stinks.  But God I love these movies.  If you decide to buy the movie let me give you some advise.  Start with a tart red wine about half of a liter.  Then watch the movie with a good high hoop beer like Samuel Adams.  You will love it.  Add some well salted butter popcorn.  One of my favorite movies, buy if at any price.

2886494,4,B000SK5ZFM,"As I have said before, Vincent Price never really got the accolades that he deserved for his long and diverse career.  Though most think of him in the horror genre, the actor was featured in a variety of films, many of them classics - ""Laura,"" ""The Ten Commandments,"" and ""Dragonwyck,"" to cite a few - and he excelled in them all.

The ""MGM Scream Legends"" compilation features seven of the actor's later works, made after his legendary collaborations with Roger Corman during the director's 60's heyday.

Price, who was skilled at scenery-stealing, which may have caused critics to be less-than-complimentary of his work, knew how to interpret the characters that he played, even when the script wasn't the best, as in the case of ""Witchfinder General,"" a gory mish-mash loosely based on the exploits of an actual witchhunter in the 17th century. The film is nauseatingly violent and could've easily been omitted from the collection that, as a whole, is excellent.

That having been said, let's give credit where credit is due.  The best of the bunch, as stated in the title of the review, are the two Phibes films and ""Theater of Blood.""  In the first Phibes, Price seeks revenge on the medical professionals that he feels were responsible for the death of his beloved wife.  The way in which he ""disposes"" of each is marvelously macabre with tongue placed firmly in cheek.  The film has a rich look about it and features a great score by Basil Kirchin.  Price is aided in the acting department by Joseph Cotten, Oscar winner Hugh Griffith, comic Terry Thomas, Peter Jeffrey as ""Inspector Trout"" and Virginia North as Phibes' silent henchwoman, ""Vulnavia.""  The second film takes up where the first ends and though not quite as satisfying as the first, it still provides good entertainment.

""Theater of Blood"" is, without a doubt, the piece de resistance of the collection, affording Price the chance to really sink his acting chops into the role of an actor, assumed dead, rubbing out the critics that denied him a coveted stage acting trophy.  Using ""the bard"" as his source of inspiration, Price's ""Edward Lionheart"" really puts poetic justice into the deaths, each one being more sensational than the next, causing the viewer to smile guiltily as they are executed.  A stellar cast, including Price's future wife Coral Browne, Michael Horden, Harry Andrews, Ian Hendry, Robert Coote, Jack Hawkins, Diana Rigg, and Milo O'Shea elevate this film a ""cut above"" others in the genre.

""Madhouse,"" though entertaining, doesn't give Price much of a stretch as he plays a horror actor who may or may not be responsible for deaths that occurred during the filming of a movie in his past as well as an upcoming television special.  Fellow genre veteran Peter Cushing is on hand as a longtime friend of Price's character.

The two anthology films, ""Twice Told Tales"" and ""A Trilogy of Terror"" are adequate but don't come up to par with the other movies in the set.  Still subpar Price is better than nothing at all.

Of course, this compilation would've been perfect had it contained both ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" but one can't always get what he wants!

By the way, as homage to those films, ""Madhouse"" features clips from them.",1228521600,3,3264,4.838129496402877

The special effects might appear dated and the scripts may not always be adhesive,but these films are all about the actors and Price himself. With co-stars like Peter Cushing,Basil Rathbone,Peter Lorre,Robert Morley amongst many others you cannot go wrong.

2886497,5,B000SK5ZFM,"This box set is a great add to any film lover's collection.  The set is also great for those who are interested in Price's work but have yet to see much of it.  I suggest watching the films by date.  The last two films in the set are the most autobiographical of Price particularly Madhouse which has flash backs within the movie of actual Vincent Price films some of which you will have seen if you go in order by date.  Although I feel Witchfinder General stands as a unique Price film and could be watched last.  Lastly finish with the Vincent Price Collection of horrors disc which should be more interesting after the movies.  The disc of horrors/Witchfinder general disc is the only DVD case containing two discs, even though it says a side and B side on the back on the DVD.  All other DVDs are two sided discs with one film on each side.

THE DISCS:

The three short films in each film disc:  Tales of Terror/Twice Told Tales.
Tales of Terror (1962) 5/5
The only film of in the box by director Roger Corman who Price has teamed up with on many occasions to produce some of their best work such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Masque-of-the-Red-Death-The-Premature-Burial/dp/B000068TPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Masque of the Red Death / The Premature Burial</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fall-of-the-House-of-Usher-The-Pit-and-the-Pendulum/dp/B0007R4T12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fall of the House of Usher /The Pit and the Pendulum</a>.  Both have made great films separately but together they made a great team and Tales of Terror is yet another example.  Terror is Based on Edgar Allan Poe's Tales of Terror and the screenplay was written by Richard Matheson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Shrinking-Man/dp/0312856644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Shrinking Man</a>), Tales of Terror is a trilogy of macabre tales starring Price in all three.  The strongest of the three is The Black Cat starring Peter Lorre opposite of price and he does a great job as a drunken husband who seeks revenge on his unfaithful wife.  The first tale is the weakest but it does get stronger from there.  Hopefully this film will lead you to other Corman/Price films and other films by the director such as X.
THE DVD:  On the back of the DVD Tales of Terror's running time is listed at120mins but actually is just shy of 90minutes.  The DVD is presented in widescreen 2:35:1 with a mono audio track.

Twice Told Tales (1963) 5/5
More of the same of Tales of Terror but this time it is three shorts based on tales written by Nathaniel Hawthorne.  These three shorts are equally great with no clear favorite as each film could appeal to a different viewer.
THE DVD:  Presented in widescreen 1.66.1 with a mono audio track

The disc with the features disc:  Witchfinder General/Vincent Price Coll. Disc of Horrors

Witchfinder General (1968) 5/5
The most brutal of the films which could be the first exploitation/torture film, although it has an actual story to go along with it and an ending reminiscent of Hooper's 1974&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-2-Disc-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2-Disc Ultimate Edition)</a>.  Price's character Matthew Hopkins goes from village to village as an official witchfinder.  Town's leaders pay him to accuse and execute those thought to be witches but he runs into some opposition from a soldier whose lover he has violated.  This is also based of an Edgar Allen Poe work and was directed by Michael Reeves.  Reeves and Price butt heads on this one which is talked about on the disc of horrors disc.  It would appear Reeves did beat some of the mannerisms out of Price as he gives a different feel to this role then any of the others in the set.
THE DVD:  The only DVD to have special features.  Audio commentary with producer Philip Waddilove and actor Ian Ogilvy and a Witchfinder General:  Michael Reeves' horror classic featurette.  Presented in widescreen 1.85:1 and a mono audio track.

Vincent Price Collection Disc of Horrors (2007) Watch this last: 4/5
There are three features on the DVD.  Vincent Price:  Renaissance Man - Historians and critics talk about his plays, art collecting, films, his cooking, basically about his life.  The Art of Fear and Working with Vincent Price are the other two features.

The Phibes Disc:  The Abominable Dr. Phibes/ Dr Phibes Rises Again:
The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) 5/5
The film tells the story of Dr. Phibes seeking revenge on a group of surgeons he holds responsible for his wife's death.  As one critic points out in the disc of horrors we are all born with a bit of psychotic in us but we mature however Dr. Phibes has never matured he is still that psychotic child.  The movie has that 70s real feel and bloody deaths although they are much more creative than most films of the time.  This is the most unique and eccentric of the Price films.
I call Dr. Phibes an influencer of horror films and one of the best in this set.  It is also similar to Theater of Blood which is also included.  There is a biblical theme and order to Phibes' murders much like David Fincher's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B000050FEN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven (New Line Platinum Series)</a>.

THE DVD:  Presented in widescreen 1.85:1 and yet another mono audio track.

Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972) 4/5
This sequel picks up literally where the last one left off and even gives a recap of the first film.  This time Phibes main goal is heading to Egypt to bring his wife back to life as he dispatches those that get in his way.  It's an entertaining horror adventure.
THE DVD:  Presented in widescreen 1.85:1 with a mono audio track.

The autobiographical films disc:  Theater of Blood/Madhouse

Theater of Blood (1973) The only R rated film. 5/5
A small time Shakespearean play actor (Price) believed to be dead comes back to take vengeance on the critics who trashed his work, by following the death scenes of his plays in the order he played them.  Again we have creative kills with that 70s exploitation look with gore and blood throughout.  During one of the kills of The Merchant of Venice I thought Price's makeup looked like Freddy Krueger from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-Infinifilm-Edition/dp/B000GETUDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street (Infinifilm Edition)</a>, maybe it inspired Wes Craven.
THE DVD:  Presented in widescreen 1.66:1 with mono audio.

Madhouse (1974) 4/5
This is the most autobiographical film in the set.  Price plays Paul Toombes a horror star whose fiance is brutally murdered.  The viewer nor Paul even knows if he did it and he loses his job and a bit of his mind only to return twelve years later to TV.  This is a fun film for Price fans as it is a mixture of his films.  The plot is somewhat reminiscent of House of Wax particularly the ending.  Literally Paul Toombes films are played throughout during interviews and banquets and they are actual Vincent Price films such as The Pit and the Pendulum and Tales of Terror.  Tales of Terror even seems to have the same effect on Toombes as it did Price's character in that film.

2886498,5,B000SK5ZFM,"Vincent Price is at his best in these shows; that is, those that were viewable in this packaged assortment. While the movies presented here are certainly 5 stars, MGM did NOT cut the DVD's for The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Dr. Phibes Rises Again! I purchased two different copies of these DVD's : One from Amazon - the one this review is written for - and another - also produced by MGM - at a DVD store where I live. In both cases, the Dr. Phibes movies were NOT transferred to the DVD during the MGM 'cutting' process: all that appears is the MGM logo, and nothing else. I tried these discs in three different DVD players, and still, nothing.

If you enjoy Dr. Phibes as much as I do and want to buy discs that work, buy from a merchant that is selling his old working versions. Otherwise, you're taking a chance, since apparently MGM cut some disks, but did not cut others.",1212278400,,876,4.341463414634147
2886499,4,B000SK5ZFM,"Each generation has their heroes of horror. The first circled around names like Karloff and Lugosi. Today's generation revels in names like Jason, Michael and Pinhead. And during the sixties? We grew up with Vincent Price.

MGM has just released a DVD box set of several classics by actor Vincent Price, known for his well toned voice and sinister yet dashing looks. Most horror fans loved him for the Roger Corman directed Edgar Allan Poe films that he did. But the films represented here offer a bit more.

The box set contains 4 discs: 1-TALES OF TERROR (based on the works of Poe) and TWICE TOLD TALES (based on the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne), 2-THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES and DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN (two must have movies for all Price fans). 3-THEATER OF BLOOD (one of Price's favorite roles) and MADHOUSE and 4-WITCHFINDER GENERAL (also released under the name THE CONQUEROR WORM) and DISC OF HORRORS which contains three documentary looks at Price, his work and his life.

Each of these films, with the exception of WITCHFINDER GENERAL, has been released previously but not in a boxed set. And WITCHFINDER GENERAL, a much hailed film, has never seen release until now. The film chronicles events surrounding real life witch hunter Matthew Hopkins in the Middle Ages as he abuses his legal powers eventually leading to his downfall. While some view this as a high mark in British horror films, I found it a bit slow moving and not one of Price's best efforts. It did offer a rather brutal amount of violence for a film shot in the 60s and for that might make it worth watching.

Of the set (and moving past the classic Phibes films which deserve an entire article all their own) I have found that MADHOUSE was a neglected film that deserves seeing. Price stars as a Hollywood horror star that loses his mind after the death of his wife. Years later, a producer wants to resurrect not only the star but the character he played, Dr. Death, for TV. When things begin happening on the set, you are left to wonder has he really recovered or has he gone insane, now a killer stalking the cast and crew?

While many think of this as not much of a movie, it does offer tons of entertaining fun and Price playing a character that is basically himself. The film offers chills that young ones could handle and a story that is interesting, leaving the identity of the killer till the very end and then offering a twist to top that.

If you've never seen a Vincent Price film, you're not a true horror fan. And there is little better place you will find to start than with this box set. It's not only worth watching, it's worth adding to your collection.",1200700800,3,2649,4.578059071729958
2886500,5,B000SK5ZFM,"Johnny Depp has said that aside from his budding friendship with Tim Burton the main reason he did Edward Scissorhands was for the chance to work with the legendary Vincent Price in what turned out to be his last film appearance.  He was that kind of actor.  On screen he commanded the screen like no other horror star of his generation with the possible exception of Boris Karloff.  He reveled in his roles.  And he rose indomitably (pardon the pun) to the occasion again and again.  From the forties through to the eighties.  Add to this the fact that he was a much sought after character actor in films of the late thirties and forties and even into the fifties with The Ten Commandments.  As to this product.
None of the films are his greatest and none are his worst.  Included are the two Dr. Phibes films which sparked yet another revival of his career late in the game.  They are coy and filled with demonic glee that only Price could deliver.  And this mind you is behind a frozen mask and with limited vocal delivery.  The Audience knew intimately the man behind the mask and applauded his last great screen performances for what they were -tongue-in-cheek nods to his career.  God Bless Tim Burton for giving him the proper send-off he so richly deserved in Edward Scissorhands.  And passing the gauntlet (again pardon the pun) as it were to Mr. Depp at the same time.  Depp's Sweeney Todd should ensconce him alongside Price and Karloff in this kind of depraved tormented characters they specialized in.

This set is well worth having.  Nothing Price ever did lets you down.  He always gave it his all.  Other actors laughed at him and called him the Canned Ham of Horror, but his career went on and on while theirs fell by the wayside.  You be the judge.  Buy it.  I dare you.",1197763200,5,1788,4.525
2886501,5,B000SK5ZFM,"This is a great set from the MGM vaults.  Granted, all these films are have been available individually, but it's much easier on your wallet to do it this way(if you don't mind slim dvd cases that is).  Putting together a bigger career spanning collection would make this set enormous, but I have no complaints about the selections here.  Some of Price's best performances are included in this set.  Best performances being Dr. Phibes, Theater of Blood and Witchfinder General.  Also included is Madhouse, which alot of folks consider a dud, but I actually like it, and it's the only time you'll see Price acting with Peter Cushing(this should have happened more).  The only new addition is the Disc of Horrors which includes three short, yet quite informative documentaries about Price, as told by a group of film historians, writers and critics(man, he seemed like such a nice guy).  Definitely a no brainer for the Price fans and worth the money if you haven't already bought the movies individually.  If you missed it for Halloween, better make sure you get someone to purchase it for you for Christmas!",1194393600,3,1107,4.851063829787234
8205602,5,B000SK5ZFM,"Great collection. These are films that still hold up today. Movies from a day when people were more interested in good acting than shock value, and it shows. Price plays a varied array of characters, all entertaining. He's joined by Peter Cushing, Basil Rathbone and a slew of other greats of the era. Totally recommended to classic horror fans.",1521763200,,345,4.864406779661017

Have not viewed all the discs yet but have had no playback issues so far. Only draw back for me is the double sided discs. I loathe them. Other than that ya can't go wrong with this Vincent Price set.",1518220800,,324,4.327868852459017

8205606,4,B000SK5ZFM,"I bought this because it has three of my favorite Vincent Price movies, the two Dr. Phibes and Theatre of Blood.  He gets to do a voiceover in the Phibe's films which allows him to play his character with great subtlety.  While in the Theatre he gets to overact with relish, while co-star Diana Rigg gets to getaway from her Emma Peel persona.  Watch the comic detectives in all three of these for fun British dry humor.
The rest of the films are not as good.  Tales of terror and Twice Told Tales are compilations of short films.  Madhouse is terrible. Witchfinder General's features are actually better than the movie.  And the last Disc of Horrors is worthwhile only if you like information about Vincent Price.
Trivia:  Vincent Price and Peter Lorre did a pilot for a tv series about two detectives who were involved in horror mysteries.  Unfortunately the plot of the pilot was terrible and the series was not picked up.  What a romp that would have been.",1512432000,,960,4.6

The bonus features disc is nice but if you have purchased the Scream Factory Blu-ray Vincent Price Collection part 2 you will see that they are mostly all of the same featurettes.

Nice commentary on Witchfinder General however which is a difficult title to find at a reasonable price unless you purchase this collection.",1498521600,2,451,4.782051282051282
