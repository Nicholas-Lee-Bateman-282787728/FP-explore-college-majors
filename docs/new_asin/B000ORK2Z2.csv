8186436,2,B000ORK2Z2,"TOTALLY AGREE with the HORRIBLE subtitles --trully a 'mess' as Mr. Givens above has reviewed.  You are better off to watched the fan-dubbed versions online.  i was very embarassed to share this with my family with the horrendous english subs.  i myself am asian and am pretty forgiving about 'bad' english but this one bites the cake.  I cannot even begin to address how bad the English is here from misuse of pronouns and prepositions to word choice to nonsense sentences/phrases due to lack of punctuation marks.  It is really that bad to the point that had i not watched the fan-dubbed versions online, I would NOT have understood this kdrama.  DO NOT BUY!",1283731200,,659,4.7368421052631575
8186437,2,B000ORK2Z2,"This is a great series and the video quality itself is very good. However, the subtitles in English are an incoherent mess of of poor interpretation, sentence structure and word choice. It is nearly impossible to follow along most of the time. When we watched this on the SBS channel, the English was much better. It is perhaps the worst dubbing I have ever seen in my lifetime.",1230422400,,378,4.573529411764706
