7507891,5,B017LJFQ06,"I've been following Big Biting Pig (the production company behind this film) for a while now. Their films consistently exceed expectations for a low-budget indie film, and make no mistake: they are about as low-budget and as indie as you can get. But they're sneaky, you see: there's a visual wit to their films, a great appreciation of irony and melodrama, and an aspiration to make every single penny count.

Frances Stein is the latest of their films. For the first time, I proactively went out and bought the DVD rather than waiting for it to come on Amazon Prime. I'm glad I did.

The film has all the hallmarks of a BBP film, especially actors punching gleefully above their weight class, throwing caution to the wind and sometimes missing the target, but surprisingly often, hitting the bulls-eye. (Yes, I know that's a mixed metaphor. Forgive me; it's late.) These are fearless actors, and they throw themselves completely into their roles. It's exhilarating to watch.

""Frances Stein"" features PJ Woodside (also the writer and director) as the eponymous mad scientist of the the 1930's variety, replete with a Bride-of-Frankenstein streak of grey and crazy seizures. Dr. Stein is mad in more ways than one: she's out-of-her-skull crazy, but there's also a method to her madness. Recently fired from her scandal-laced research job, she's had to sit idly by while her husband has married a younger and more attractive (if not particularly nice) woman---a woman, who by the way, has not just made moves on her ex-husband and Stein's old house, she's also making moves on Stein's old science department!

How much insult can a mad scientist take? When she shows up uninvited to a party hosted by her ex-husband and his new wife, with all her former colleagues gathered, there's a murderous glint in her twitchy eye. Somebody's going to pay! Muhahahaha!

We see nearly all of this film in flashback, as told to some inquisitors---the nature of whom is left unclear for a long time. We start by seeing the fallout of what happened, and then we go back and see what actually happened. It's a delightfully sneaky device, and there's many a twist and turn to keep you guessing and laughing with delight.

To be clear, despite the subject matter, this really isn't a horror film. It's more of a postmodern thriller, with clever visual gags. (My favorite is at the beginning of the film when an out-of-focus Dr. Stein is preparing for ... something, while a cellphone receives texts in the foreground and just at the edge of the frame is a pair of handcuffs! Uh oh, that can't be good!)

Now bear in mind, this is low-budget and indie. You're not going to get the polish of a Hollywood film, nor do you get Stepford Wifes/Husbands as actors. These guys are severely constrained by budget and it shows. Yet that same constraint forces them to be remarkably inventive. If this is what they can put together for this kind of budget, I'd love to see what they could do with $30 million or so!

I refer to Big Biting Pig as my ""growth stock"". It's thrilling to watch these guys at a relatively early point in their trajectory. Each production is that much more polished and more wittily filmed. Frankly, I can't wait until their next film comes out. :)

And if any of you reading this happen to be billionaires, how about throwing a little financial backing their way? I guarantee they'll make every single penny count.",1455408000,,3412,4.75

7507902,4,B017LJFQ06,"I loved this movie for so many reasons. A musician once said there are only so many variations on the eight note scale, and while we have much more variance in say, art or movies (yeah, yeah they're the same) it's DELIGHTFUL to come across a storyline that is truly new in tale. But not just that, I'm one of those proverbial ""ugly ducklings"", very blah until I grew up and surprise surprise became easy on the eyes. I cringe when people, women particularly, use the phrase "" oh she looks like a REAL woman"" to describe anyone who isn't fit and very attractive. However, come ON people, most people DON'T look like tens, and it's getting SOOOO tedious to see everyone in any sitcom or movie cosmetic surguried to the nth degree. Virtually everyone iin this movie looks like....okay I'll say it, REAL PEOPLE. My mind just went ""ahhhhhhhhhhhh"" How on earth did they get away with a whole cast of normals? A WHOLE CAST! Well enough of that, the acting was good, the twist at the end made me smile and I was rooting for Frances from the first scene. It's a tight well-done little Sci-fi and you first think it's the everyday ungrateful sow of a husband flipping his wife who pays more attention to her work than her appearance over for a younger model. You will be happily surprised. I really LOVE strange unusual love stories, like ""The Fog"", "" Monster's Ball"" ""Lo"" and this is added to my collection. Even the young lab assistant, who is the object of his heart? Frumpy Frances. Well worth a see.",1480550400,2,1494,4.4963235294117645

While this movie doesn't have known stars the acting was not too bad.  The story of course has a few twists and a few surprises.  The concept of living forever is one I don't think I would personally like because change keeps happening and one would need to continue to adapt.  That does not mean that you can't adapt, it just means you may not like having to adapt. Overall, the movie is worth watching and hanging on until the end.",1466812800,3,541,4.223300970873787

Without giving away the twists, this film tells the story of a brilliant neuroscientist with a plan to make practical (and macabre) use of her research.

The acting and cinematography are very good, but the story lags a bit. It just fails to keep the tension consistent throughout. Where the action spikes, it spikes hard, but where it lags, the movie feels like it drags on unnecessarily. For instance, the action falls flat in scenes where a character researches another character's whereabouts, and where we, the audience, are given info dumps on neuroscience. Granted, neuroscience is a specialized field and the audience can't be expected to follow along without some guidance, but expository scenes like these bogged the action down.

7507952,2,B017LJFQ06,"So it's a ""different"" take on Frankenstein. While it is an indie movie, with a small budget etc, which i do take into account. (which means keep your volume remote nearby because the audio is once again awful)

Dr. Frances Stein is recently divorced from her husband Patrick, who is now married (?) to a younger woman. Frances used to be a great scientist, but this divorce has painted her as ""crazy"". Patrick's new wife is also a scientist and Frances starts on her own experiments and restoring her name and the movie kind of goes from there, it's rather drawn out and i don't feel like going into too much of it because it could be considered ""spoilers"" .

That doesn't make it wonderful, the script went everywhere, and dragged on in a lot of areas, trying to throw you off the ""trail"", honestly, if the ending is a big twist to you, then i can see why you liked it, but every major plot point was already figured out. I actually prefer when PJ stars in her own movies because she is actually not a half bad. It's sweet in a way, but it gets old really fast, at only an hour and a half long it felt like it dragged on for at least 3 hours.
I'm very supportive of indie films, but that doesn't mean i'm going to give it five stars, just because it's low budget, this is rated on all things: story, acting, plot. I don't let low budget get in the way of judging these films. I wish they would stop writing reviews for their own movies. Plenty of people will watch a low rated movie, it lowers expectations and sometimes makes things better and turns out in your favor. When you write fake reviews, it annoys the audience. Having genuine reviews is a good thing. I personally seek out lower rated films on here, just to see if they are ""that bad"" , sometimes they are, sometimes they aren't. This movie needed a lot of editing, a LOT, tons of stuff could have been taken out and added in some more details of other parts.

Normally I wouldn't have stayed tuned after the first 20 minutes but  because it had such great reviews I stuck it out and I'm glad I did.  The story was original, the twists will make you wonder about who's really the bad guy or the mad scientist.  I will probably watch it again, I don't think that there was much to be missed.  The simplicity of the scenes makes you focus on the characters and the story that they are telling.  I will say that the ending was an excellent.",1462147200,2,559,4.326923076923077

7507990,5,B017LJFQ06,"I've been following Big Biting Pig (the production company behind this film) for a while now. Their films consistently exceed expectations for a low-budget indie film, and make no mistake: they are about as low-budget and as indie as you can get. But they're sneaky, you see: there's a visual wit to their films, a great appreciation of irony and melodrama, and an aspiration to make every single penny count.

Frances Stein is the latest of their films. It has all the hallmarks of a BBP film, especially actors punching gleefully above their weight class, throwing caution to the wind and sometimes missing the target, but surprisingly often, hitting the bulls-eye. (Yes, I know that's a mixed metaphor. Forgive me; it's late.) These are fearless actors, and they throw themselves completely into their roles. It's exhilarating to watch.

""Frances Stein"" features PJ Woodside (also the writer and director) as the eponymous mad scientist of the the 1930's variety, replete with a Bride-of-Frankenstein streak of grey and crazy seizures. Dr. Stein is mad in more ways than one: she's out-of-her-skull crazy, but there's also a method to her madness. Recently fired from her scandal-laced research job, she's had to sit idly by while her husband has married a younger and more attractive (if not particularly nice) woman---a woman, who by the way, has not just made moves on her ex-husband and Stein's old house, she's also making moves on Stein's old science department!

How much insult can a mad scientist take? When she shows up uninvited to a party hosted by her ex-husband and his new wife, with all her former colleagues gathered, there's a murderous glint in her twitchy eye. Somebody's going to pay! Muhahahaha!

We see nearly all of this film in flashback, as told to some inquisitors---the nature of whom is left unclear for a long time. We start by seeing the fallout of what happened, and then we go back and see what actually happened. It's a delightfully sneaky device, and there's many a twist and turn to keep you guessing and laughing with delight.

To be clear, despite the subject matter, this really isn't a horror film. It's more of a postmodern thriller, with clever visual gags. (My favorite is at the beginning of the film when an out-of-focus Dr. Stein is preparing for ... something, while a cellphone receives texts in the foreground and just at the edge of the frame is a pair of handcuffs! Uh oh, that can't be good!)

Now bear in mind, this is low-budget and indie. You're not going to get the polish of a Hollywood film, nor do you get Stepford Wifes/Husbands as actors. These guys are severely constrained by budget and it shows. Yet that same constraint forces them to be remarkably inventive. If this is what they can put together for this kind of budget, I'd love to see what they could do with $30 million or so!

I refer to Big Biting Pig as my ""growth stock"". It's thrilling to watch these guys at a relatively early point in their trajectory. Each production is that much more polished and more wittily filmed. Frankly, I can't wait until their next film comes out. :)

And if any of you reading this happen to be billionaires, how about throwing a little financial backing their way? I guarantee they'll make every single penny count.",1461283200,7,3275,4.784070796460177
