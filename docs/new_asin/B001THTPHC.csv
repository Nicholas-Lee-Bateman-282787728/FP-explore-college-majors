8341452,5,B001THTPHC,"This whacked little horror flick that is actually a smart horror film should really speak to hardcore horror fans.

This teen horror blogger starts his first day of summer school, and before long, he is falling asleep. Soon after that, he begins repeatedly awakening to find himself trapped in another nightmare scenario. So its sort of a horror anthology because each story is totally unrelated, yet they are all happening to the same kid!

Within the halls of his school, he faces off against: a satanic cult of students; a quickly spreading spider infection; a sadistic Nazi executioner (the most suspenseful segment that is eerily real in the way it shows a school shooting playing out); and vampires (the most playful and humorous segment). He also steps out of the school in one dream and into a backwoods Deliverance nightmare, complete with horny, racist rednecks. And eventually, he dreams that he is the biggest threat to the other kids in the school.

The main actor is perfect in his role, as is the limited number of other cast members. And while the first segments are short and him constantly waking from another nightmare may feel repetitive, the stories get longer and more involved. And each story has a different director and writer, but you wouldnt really know it. Because despite each nightmare being a unique scenario, theres actually a progression to how they are affecting our young horror loverand what his obsession with the genre may be saying about his grip on reality.",1424217600,,1497,4.909090909090909
8341453,4,B001THTPHC,"Before I went to K-Mart and purchased this in a pack of 8 horror movies just recently, I had never heard of this one before.  Needless to say this was without a doubt the only unique one that I've seen lately.

For a concept like this to come along is a great occurence.  Much like the main character Charles I too am quite the horror fan.  He's one character that is easy for me to relate to in that respect.  If you are a truly devoted horror fan than you can say that you are Charles.  What's fun for me is pretending that I'm him while he dreams away during summer school.

I'm not going to go into much detail about what his dreams entail, but let's just say that some of it comes to a satanic cult, vampires, crazy rednecks, a slasher etc.

Also there's two flunky and idiotic classmates, a hot yet strict teacher, and beautiful and incredibly hot love interest Lindsay.  Follow Charles through his daydreams of great gore, terror, camp and comedy.  I find the school to make for an interesting environment as well.  Charles shoots a few hoops, attempts to either avoid or talk the jib with the hall monitor, yaks with the 2 slacker students, and at random times, runs into his sexy classmate and in between he finds the time to have creepy horror-based dreams where every time he dies in one he wakes up.  After that you never know what Charles will fall into next.  Is he going to have another dream? or is he going to be roaming the hallways? or will he be back in class?  You just never know.

I highly recommend this movie if you not only like or love horror but just want something different.",1408492800,3,1604,4.3355704697986575
8341454,3,B001THTPHC,"Summer School (Ben Trandem, 2006)

Clever take on the anthology-horror genre that would have been much better with a higher caliber of actor, but is still sharp and amusing enough for a rental. Charles (Simon Wallace) runs a movie review blog, and the night before summer school began, he spent his time catching up on horror flicks. He gets to his physics class early, slumps down, falls asleep, and then goes through a series of nightmares that mirror the plots of the movies he'd watched the night before, all featuring the other folks in the class: cute softball player Lindsey (Amy Cocchiarella), class burnouts Steve (Papier-Mache's Tony Czech) and Dennis (Lance Hendrickson), their teacher (Living Dead Girl's Jennifer Prettyman), and a cop who's in the building to make sure the burnouts stay in class (Fall into Me's Ty Richardson).

Trandem did the frame, but each of the stories is done by a different person. One of the things that makes this movie interesting is that these are all first-timer directors who have industry experience in other parts of the job (Mike P. Nelson is a successful sound designer, most recently on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives; Hendrickson is an actor; Steve Rhoden is a make-up guy; Troy McCall is a cinematographer; Trandem is in special effects). And you kind of get what you'd expect; it feels a lot like a first movie of the ""man, when directors do that, it's cool! We should do that!"" variety, but you have to love the enthusiasm these guys bring to the table. That's also true for most of the actors (Cocchiarella has since gone on to production assistancy, and thank heaven for that. Gorgeous, but not an actor). Don't get me wrong, as should be obvious you can't go into this expecting Winter's Bone, because you will inevitably be disappointed. But as long as you're used to low-budget amateur horror flicks, you'll get a kick out of this one. ***",1299542400,9,1896,4.8128834355828225
8341455,2,B001THTPHC,"This film has a great ending...just what the horror buff ordered...but it took so long to take off, I'm not sure many viewers could last until the end.  If you like low-budget...but creative horror...this one's for you. It's not a film you'd want to see more than once...a good rental for a group of young fans.  2 1/2 stars!",1251072000,7,325,4.491525423728813
