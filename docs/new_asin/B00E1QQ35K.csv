The people involved in creating this DVD should be banned from any further filming! I purchased it as a gift, now my Dad must think that I hate him! Old time serials are fun and campy......this is garbage. I will never trust this seller again, the quality of their merchandise is horrible, water-boarding is preferable to this DVD!",1277683200,11,441,4.594936708860759
