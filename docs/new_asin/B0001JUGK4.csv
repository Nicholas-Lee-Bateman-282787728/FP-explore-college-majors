8013446,5,B0001JUGK4,"This is a collection of the best episodes of one of the best cartoons of the 70s-namely Fat Albert & The Cosby Kids. ""Creativity"" tells the story of the founding of the group's ""Junkyard Band."" ""Moving"" incorporates Bill Cosby's ""Buck Buck"" routine (from his 1967 album ""Revenge"") into an amusing tale of Fat Albert moving away. ""Playing Hookey"" is a real hoot about FA & co. doing just that and meeting bums who quickly make them see the error of their ways. Check out Mushmouth's pronunciation of ""Big Biff's Bully Beef and Barbeque."" Great songs to boot. 70s children and lovers of animation rejoice- HEY HEY HEY!",1084752000,12,616,4.766355140186916
