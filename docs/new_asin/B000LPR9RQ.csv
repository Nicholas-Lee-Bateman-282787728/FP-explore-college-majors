Been a huge fan since I first saw it in the 80's on NightFlight. I taped it, but my dad taped over it, so it's been a memory/dream ever since. The thing I recall the most:

His eating potato chips while watching late-night TV - the way the crunch overpowered the televison. That, and the fact that he disappears into the power outlet on a flying potato, never to be heard or seen again.

Seems that this is based on a true story. I hope to find out more once my DVD arrives!!!

Never seen the other one (bonus!) about the shoes, so that will be a treat.",1173744000,,580,4.245454545454545
