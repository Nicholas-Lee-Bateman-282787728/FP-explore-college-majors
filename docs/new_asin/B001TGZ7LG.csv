3789436,2,B001TGZ7LG,"Too bad this movie was made.  To me it is a perfect example of remakes never being as good as the original.  Twenty minutes after the movie started IT stood still and never moved again.  It's hard to believe how BAD Cathy Bates -as the perfect leader of the heavy handed military -is in this picture.  She's just awful. Unless you have about two hours that mean nothing to you, don't bother.",1436918400,2,391,4.388888888888889
3789437,2,B001TGZ7LG,"movie remakes are a particular pet-peeve of mine. they're substantially less likely to recapture the old magic than to desecrate the original. the electric chair is too good for whoever decided to displace a suave charmer like Frank Sinatra with a Hollywood nepotism poster-boy like George Clooney (Ocean's 11), not to mention a relatable everyman like like Gary Cooper with an Adam Sandler like Adam Sandler (Mr. Deeds Goes To Town).
okay, so there's an exception or two to the rule. the Steve Martin version of Father Of The Bride, for instance, brings a wonderful new perspective to a once great film which frankly hasn't aged well. my favorite movie, Lord Of The Rings, vastly improves upon a cartoon version so vapid that it couldn't even be bothered to finish the story!
The Day The Earth Stood Still is such a case, but only up to a point. it manages to update the original surprisingly well - it's basic flavor is best comparable to that of The X-Files - but still falls short. although to be fair, that's more the fault of changing times and viewpoints than of the film itself.
simply put, the 1951 version is literally one of the most revolutionary films ever made. it's often cited as the first ""adult"" science-fiction production ever mounted, and/or the first stepping stone from the Saturday matinee escapism of Flash Gordon to the philosophical sophistication of Star Trek. it's even been called the Citizen Kane of science-fiction cinema.
this film, on the other hand, is a standard, assembly-line ""popcorn"" movie. in a world where science-fiction is orthodox and commonplace,  that pretty much all the formula ever could've created. i repeat, it's not the debacle past examples indicate it should be, but it's hardly about to make anyone forget it's precedent-setting ancestor. like all remakes, it never quite manages to escape the fact that it's a basically product of the original's influence.
it's easy enough to follow and explain it's the thinking behind it's updates. there being no Cold War anymore, this one deals with the aftermath of nuclear energy. (although it could be argued that nukes are just as outdated.) where the original Klaatu, as played by Michael Rennie, was acting as a diplomat, his successor, as played by Keanu Reeves, is essentially a soldier on a more cynical mission. this time around, his people are convinced that humanity has forfeited it's right to live, but want to save Earth as it is one of the few worlds that can sustain life.
there are a few points where they up the ante pretty much just because they can. most obviously, Gort the robot has gone from the size of a Earthling (albeit an atypically tall one) to several stories high. also, Klaatu is no longer a single ambassador but one of many sent to various nations. the fact that we never actually see any of these counterparts makes one wonder what the point of establishing them was.
on the whole though, the film is smart enough to keep the visually effects at a manageable level, serving only such CG as the story requires. in an age when the likes of Stephen Sommers and Michael Bay routinely get carried away with the spectacle at the expense of the story, there's something refreshing, possibly even poetic, about this film's technological understatedness.
most curiously, there's no case of all Earth's technology being momentarily frozen, with the exception of those (flying vehicles, hospital equipment) who's deactivation could be fatal to someone. the film actually lacks the development from which it derives it's title!
so when you get right down to it, the film is a pleasant enough way to kill an hour and 44 minutes, but ultimately neither brilliant enough to delight nor wretched enough to offend. when it comes to the  all-important emotional matters that make or break a film, it pretty much just sits there.
i once heard Roger Ebert or someone like that suggest that if you insist on remaking a film, maybe you should try to improve upon one that misfired rather than bastardizing a classic. sounds like pretty sage advice to me. i'll admit i'm not 100 percent sure - hell, i'm not ONE percent sure - it's even possible to repair Waterworld or Howard The Duck, but how much worse could it be than the films which dragged The Stepford Wives and The Manchurian Candidate down to their level?",1435622400,3,4322,4.839189189189189

3789440,3,B001TGZ7LG,"The original story, in 1951 if I have my dates right, did not rely on special effects.  Sure, there was the robot and the flying saucer, which both looked great for the pre-computer effects era.  The movie was based totally on the plot that alien civilizations are getting worried about our rocket and atomic power technology.  They come to warn us - you can blow yourself up but if you take it into outer space we'll have to wipe you out.  It was based on a short story which, funny enough, had a totally different plot but DID have a huge robot that turned out to be the one in charge.
The message in the 2008 movie is a tad different.  It seems that the aliens have been watching for a very long time and waiting for us to get our act together.  It seems that Earth is a rare type of planet in that it can hold a very complex network of life.  Keanu Reeves, playing Klaatu, gives the impression that most planets just are not as rich in life as Earth.  And of course we humans are trashing the planet.  So we have to go.
The special effects are OK but don't come across very well on the TV screen.  Which is terrible because they really did toss a lot of time and, I assume, money into those scenes which used lots of computer graphics.  Money and time they could have poured into the rest of the story.
Even the original Klaatu from the 1951 version was able to smile and get along with people on a more emotional level.  Nor did he die in the process of trying to save us.  Frankly I would suggest getting the original, if you can find it.  Even getting this movie as a Christmas gift can not make it enjoyable to me, in other words I got it free, and I ENJOY bad sci-fi movies!

8341191,1,B001TGZ7LG,"The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2008 film

It is 1928, a man sits in a tent while cold winds blow in a snowy climate. He goes outside and chips on ice. Next a professor talks to her students about organisms in todays world. At home she talks to a child playing a violent video game. A telephone call tells of visitors who take her away. Its a matter of national security! She joins others. This is not a game. An object is arriving from outer space at a high speed. If it hits the earth it will be devastating! The object slows down and lands. Military and police forces arrive. Who has jurisdiction? A shot is fired! A tall creature arrives, armed men fall before his rays. The wounded alien is treated somehow for a gunshot wound. The humanoid recovers. There are reports of other arrivals around the world, people flee from cities. It understands our language.

The Secretary of Defense questions the alien. He represents a group of peoples, and wants to speak to the United Nations. They want to sedate him. Then he is questioned. But things don't go as expected! The humanoid escaped. The world is in turmoil! Dr. Helen Benson is called to Penn Station in Newark NJ, she meets the alien. They send in the drones, who are neutralized by the tall metal-clad alien! What can people do? Nothing. He came to save the earth. They stop at a restaurant, the alien speaks to another, who wants to remain on earth. The metal-clad alien is captured by the military. Klaatu is the name of the other alien. Will he move in with Dr. Benson? No. Klaatu says this planet is dying and he wants to save it. That means eliminating the people who are destroying it! The decision is made.

A police car arrives for an event. Unbelievable? Will a great flood cleanse the earth? Will people be saved? Scientists analyze the metal-clad alien. Civil unrest breaks out around the world! People change on the brink of destruction. Helen, her son Jacob, and Klaatu flee. Suddenly a helicopter captures Helen! Will Jacob watch his step? What will happen to the metal-clad alien? The military attacks that humanoid, who escapes. A truck on the highway disintegrates! Jacob and Klaatu visit a cemetery. Helen arrives; she asks for another chance. A sports stadium is destroyed! An explosion stops the car! Jacob is saved. The lights come back on. The big globes leave the earth. Humanity is saved.

This message movie attempts to scare people by imagining a dying world that will be killed by invaders from outer space. Is the Earth being killed by too many people and greenhouse gas? No, even if these claims have been made for decades. There was global warming from 800AD to 1300AD, the Medieval Warming Period. It was followed by the Little Ice Age that lasted to 1850. Volcanoes affect the weather, so too an asteroid that strikes the earth. Watch the original 1951 movie for a better story. Immanuel Velikovsky wrote Worlds in Collision to explain past catastrophes upon earth; so too Earth in Upheaval.",1527724800,,2981,4.661596958174905

8341198,1,B001TGZ7LG,"This so-called remake is so poor in almost every respect- storyline sequences are in different order than original (Klaatu faces US Army first off, then speaks to US representative, followed by visiting the professor). Also in the original the boy & Klaatu becomes friends were now the boy is against Klaatu.  The new story is not credibility. The original story was. The way the earth people behave you wish that robot would just incinerate the earth and move on. Demonstration of everything turning off (e.g., no electric power, traffic stops) now occurs at the end whereas it ocurred after visiting the professor before speaking to world's scientists. Klaatu doesn't speak to the world's scientist.

The only good thing are the special effects. I think a better story would have shown Klaatu's world and example of where a planet was obliterated.",1473379200,,849,5.057142857142857
8341199,5,B001TGZ7LG,I saw the original and compared this modern version  and the modern remake is so much better. Not all remakes turn out well this one did. I'm a Keanu Reeves fan anyway from the Matrix and Constantine. Will please most Si-Fi fans,1471046400,,228,4.428571428571429
8341200,2,B001TGZ7LG,"Let me state from the outset that I am completely open to re-makes, if only out of curiosity.  I want to see what creative people can do, and sometimes the result is an improvement, e.g. The Talented Mr. Ripley, both versions of which are great in their own ways.  Of course, when they fail, they appear to be crass commercial efforts, laden with special effects, indifferent acting, and silly attempts to render them ""relevant"" to the contemporary scene.  Unfortunately, this film fall into the latter case - in spades.

The original is a product of the Cold War:  rudimentary atomic experiments have brought Earth to the attention of an interstellar community, which sends a representative to reason with the earthlings.  Of course, he meets fear and paranoia, typical of the anticommunist crusade.  Nonetheless, he is warm and interested in getting to know the culture he is confronting, to which a boy and his widowed mother introduce him.  It is intelligent, moving, and completely believable, leaving a hopeful message and deadly menace at the same time.

The Reeves version throws out everything good about the original, while trying to update the themes to a more general concern for the environment.  Beyond the fact that it simply doesn't work, Reeves strips the character of all nuance:  the judgement has already been made - humans must be eradicated as parasites on a rare and lush planet - so the humans must convince him otherwise.  While Connolly is a great actress, she is wooden in this role as a scientist, there is none of the bantering if suspicious interaction between human and alien.  Furthermore, the child actor absolutely stinks.  SO what does it do?  Falls back on surprisingly mediocre CGI, yet the details do not fit into some greater conception - probably because there isn't a well conceived one.

Not recommended.  Reeves is laughably bad.",1454544000,,1872,4.967845659163987
