8365595,4,B002DOBNO8,"Chinese film (Mandarin language spoken - English subtitles) that is a little confusing at first, but ultimately makes sense when everything is tied together as the film goes on.  Although some behaviour by characters, such as bothering about waiting for change (one Chinese dollar) in a taxi when they had to get somewhere quickly made little sense).  The non red shirt passenger in the cab, was a bit too extreme mimbo intelligence level to be believable, but overall the movie is something that seems plausible, if you allow for coincidences to take place to bring all the characters together.  Basically the main character (girl on the DVD cover) is a taxi driver who is obsessed with finding her boyfriend, who disappeared (well sort of he sends her letters) four years ago.  She has a magazine full of his photos behind the driver's seat in her cab, and asks passengers if they've seen him.  We come into the film seeing two passengers who are politely allowing her to ramble on, she asks them questions, they communicate, but one a bit more chatty than the other.  They need to get somewhere to meet someone for a very important appointment.  Meanwhile in another car a couple where the woman seems to be a bit simple.  The two cars occupants stories will cross.  It's hard to talk about this film without giving anything away, but there's a lot more to the storyline than that.  There's some dark turns in the film and some funny situations.  Check it out!",1507939200,,1463,4.7204724409448815
8365596,3,B002DOBNO8,"At times moving, confusing, and gripping, ""The Equation of Love & Death,"" the 2008 sophomore effort from director Cao Baoping, will keep you wondering what's going on even as it plays at your heart strings. Zhou Xun, most likely known to western audiences from her turn in ""Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,"" plays Li Mi, a somewhat neurotic cabbie who stumbles into a criminal enterprise while searching for her former lover. On screen for just about the entire movie, this is a star turn for Zhou, and her engaging performance keeps your interest as this stylish crime-drama unfolds the slightly confusing plot.

TEOL&D is a mildly tense and satisfactory movie that's worth a rental if you can find it. Unless you are a big fan of the actress or director, it doesn't merit the purchase investment, but it's still worth a viewing. 3.5 stars.",1483315200,,850,4.862068965517241
8365597,5,B002DOBNO8,"Mi (Zhou Xun) is a taxi driver in Kunming, a city in Southwest China. 4 years ago her boyfriend Wen left the town for a seasonal job and never came back. He kept sending her letters but he never told her why he was not coming back or when or if he would ever come back. Then one day Mi  finds Wen back in town, with another woman. When she confronts him, he steadfastly denies that he is Wen and that he knows her. Amid anger, confusion and despair, Mi desperately tries to find out the truth.

This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long while. The story and film-making themselves may not be that extraordinary, at least not revolutionary, but it is the raw emotions, especially those of Zhou Xun that explode out of the screen. She is just so magnificent that she makes Academy Award winners look like bad jokes (they really are, but that is a topic for another day).

The only thing I did not like was Mi's monologue at the very end that feels redundant. It feels even more so because the scene right before the monologue is utterly brilliant that I feel the movie should have just ended there.

The DVD is out of print and hard to find, but if you like less-heralded international movies, you have to check it out and you won't regret it.",1367971200,,1252,4.2478991596638656
