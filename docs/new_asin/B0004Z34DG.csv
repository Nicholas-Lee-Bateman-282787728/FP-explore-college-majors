8036331,5,B0004Z34DG,"Found it very informative. I do believe the title misrepresents its content. The average viewer, like myself, would never be exposed to this information in news outlets. It's not 'sexy' enough for the news media!",1513468800,,212,5.085714285714285
8036332,5,B0004Z34DG,"WOW, now digitally re-mastered, Great job UFOTV. Now that I can hear the narrator, this is a truly great film. Highley Recommended!!!",1489449600,2,133,5.090909090909091
8036333,2,B0004Z34DG,"Background music too loud and often inappropriate.  A low ""C"" for content.",1468627200,,74,5.166666666666667
8036334,1,B0004Z34DG,It uses 90 second spots for each scientist it lists in an attempt to create mystery about one of their inventions.  It's title implies a comparison between inventors but the bio's were to short to accomplish this.  Poor quality video and the background music made it hard to hear the narration.,1466380800,,294,4.745098039215686
8036335,5,B0004Z34DG,"Having seen some of the Energy from the Vacuum series and one or two videos from the Free Energy Series, this video seems to be on the money as far as accuracy goes.  However, I don't think I would have found this interesting at all if I watched it without any previous exposure to the topic because it provides little to no detail about how these inventions were conceived, constructed, or operated.  The combination of old photos and old sci-fi music, in my opinion, could give a new audience the impression that all of the ""evidence"" in the video is fake.  Granted, most details of these earlier inventions were probably destroyed or hidden, leaving only photos to provide as proof.  I would have to agree with both previous reviews from the teacher and the previous VHS owner.  I would say this video is valuable to any person who is willing to do independent research.  Note the names of inventors and processes, then research each of them individually.  In this way, it can still be used as a teaching tool.

In its defense, I will say that this video was created some time ago (relative to the rate that technology progresses) and very well may have served as inspiration to the more detailed information that is being made available today.",1268352000,3,1247,4.662100456621005
8036336,5,B0004Z34DG,"I have always been interested in forgotten inventors like Nikola Tesla and this documentary is well known for information about suppressed technology and the many inventors who like Tesla made seemingly miraculous discoveries, only to be forgotten by history and shunned by main stream science. I owned this film when it was originally released on VHS and it is one of my favorite films and as soon as I saw it on DVD I purchased the revised DVD edition. Beware of false and negative reviews by others who would keep this information suppressed from the world. I was very disappointed in the review from the teacher who purchased the DVD and felt it was important enough to share with his students but then later gave it a negative review after the fact. This made me very suspicious of that persons motives, especially in light of the fact that I love the film myself. It just goes to show you that ""amazon career naysayers"" serve no purpose except to breed confusion among the patrons who are looking for good information.

8036337,1,B0004Z34DG,This DVD was not at all like the review states.  It is boring and dull and should be taken off the shelf.  I have shared the DVD with several classes I teach and they also feel the same way...what a waste of my money.,1171411200,3,217,3.909090909090909
