You are absolutely right, as this film has moved you; it has moved you to vent your anger and disgust against ""snobs"". Perhaps you hate your social betters because you wish to be part of them, but you will never be. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !",1152489600,2,334,3.926470588235294
1404101,5,B0000584ZF,"This is a wonderful film, a tribute by the Chilean-born direct Raoul Ruiz, in French with subtitles that occasionally are hard to read against the gold-white light of Marcel's retrospections. The most astonishing performance is John Malkovich's as Charlus, despite the fact that he doesn't resemble him in the slightest (Proust described the baron as so fat that he waddled, and his head as enormous).

The film is based on the novel's final book, which we now know as Finding Time Again, and begins with Marcel on his deathbed, dictating in a ghostly voice the novel that will be his triumph over death. The dying writer never reappears; what we get instead are scenes from the story of his life, including Little Marcel with his magic lantern at Combray, Young Marcel meeting Charlus at Balbec, and Middle-Aged Marcel attending the final society concert chez Prince de Guermantes, It's very difficult to follow, and should by no means be regarded as hors d'oeuvres to the feast of In Search of Lost Time, but rather as a digestif to follow it. -- Dan Ford at readingproust dot com",1120780800,9,1082,4.817204301075269
1404102,1,B0000584ZF,"This film at best, is nothing but amateurish detritus which not only bores the viewer but makes him contemptuously dislike all forms of snobbery or upper middle class portraits.

I've read a few of the other reviewers who attempt to become apologists for the director's lack of talent at establishing even a modicum of interest, they say if you haven't read Proust then you will have a difficult time comprehending this, which in itself is entirely fatuous and pomp. Imagine everyone having to read one of the most lurid and over-rated books of the 20th century to see a film which should substantiate itself. What an exaggerated claim. There's no place for ""intellectual hubris"" or their own ""in-group manifesto"" here.

I had high hopes for this film actually but after the first hour I saw that it was devoid and lacking any duality which would allow us to reflect on what is occurring. It is played by rigid, high handed oafs who are spoiled to begin with.

Most of the first hour is infested by artless vignettes which are probably the deluded Proust's memory, and they are reworked in such a disordered way that what comes out is merely a bunch of meaningless, trite and vacuous scenes with banal jargon, not only because they hold absolutely no interest for us, but because they do not invite a further contemplation of what 'time' was to Proust, imagine listening to a bunch of snobs talk about the weather, well, that is what this basically is, how philosophical can one get from that point of reference? It begins to wear thin after the first scene and you pray that there will be no more discussions by those prosaic characters. And it doesn't help that Proust himself is an insipid dandy who parades around in his best suits with his neatly trimmed moustache and becomes a voyeur, if you are asleep already, I don't blame you.

Many of the scenes deal with characters which are entirely void of any human warmth or expression, they are petty aristocrats, snobs who sit and drink tea and eat stuffy food while looking down at the poor. They are [...] who visit [...] brothels and think themselves noble because they hold high office positions during the war while the common man spills his guts out at the front lines. This is a complete waste of time!

Malkovich is even an absurd caricature in here, and his little dubbed French voice is entirely insipid. I laughed at most of this. We learn that he is a libertine who likes to visit male brothels and be whipped by sincere proletarian scum, wow, what a revelation on the mystery of human existence. From the looks of the period pieces and the arrangements, it was expensive but that doesn't carry a film with people walking around with no reference to the viewer. Film is supposed to move us in a way, either disgust us or interest us in some form of merit which it presents itself to us in human understanding but boredom to me is no artistic achievement. Don't even bother with this pretentious and ennui filled work.",1101859200,7,2982,4.650853889943074
1404103,5,B0000584ZF,"Suffice it to say that Chilean-born director/screenwriter Ruiz tackled a monumental assignment. Reducing Proust's lengthy Trilogy (Remembrance of Things Past), to a few hours of screen time would have been beyond the capabilities of most filmmakers. That he has succeeded so well is a great credit to him and to his creative crew.
  The film is told in a series of flashbacks as Proust lies on his deathbed. The flashbacks are not sequential, so at points one has to pay attention to follow along. The rewards are numerous, however. This is one of the most beautifully filmed works that I've seen in ages. The director is particularly adept at pan-shots. The moving tableaux are breathtaking, like living impressionist paintings. This is particularly true in a scene of a music recital at a country chateau. The various figures are situated on moving platforms, so in addition to the moving camera pans, the platforms also slide slowly back and forth, which makes for a kaleidescopic montage unlike anything I've seen in cinema. Ruiz and cinematographer Jorge Arriagada are artists in the truest sense.
  Ruiz also managed to collect a top notch cast for the enterprise. Marcello Mazzarella is elegantly stoic as Proust. He is the artistic, calm eye of the storm as the hurricane of WWI France swirls aound him. Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, is stunningly beautiful, as always. Catherine Deneuve is a perfectly cast Mme De Crecy, though her on screen time is relatively brief. John Malkovich's French sounds pretty fair to my untrained ear. He definitely has the juiciest role as a jaded, decadent Baron of the Boulevard. Pascal Greggory chews up some scenery, as well as a boefsteak, as the gung ho, effete warrior, St-Loup (well named, as the guy really is quite loopy).
  The movie is slow going at times, which well befits an adaptation of Proust, who's not exactly known for his frenetic pacing. This is a film to savor with several repeated viewings. The DVD is an excellent transfer and the English subtitles are accurate and legible. Highly recommended.

1404104,5,B0000584ZF,"Director Raul's version of Marcel Prousts' Remembrance Of Things Past is captured beautifully and faithfully on film. It was made only recently in 1999, but it is essentially timeless. The strength of the film lies in the many dimensions it has, as with the novel. Proust's vision and world comes to life through the cinema, through good performances by the actors, period details and such beautiful, wistful music. The music and the way the film changes time frames, different perspectives, and the Impressionist, sensory images in memory that Proust created in the book are captured with great effect.
For those who have read the long book, and for those who are Proustian, this film is a sumptuous cinematic feast. You don't have to appreciate French literature and film interpretation, you can just love costume dramas. The French are a different breed. They love their champagne, their waltzes and always, Paris. The frivolous lifestyle depicted in Odette's courtesan climate is but one element of French society, at least as it was in the late 19th century. Swann, as we know, is the author himself. Proust put himself in Swann, and became the restless, troubled youth searching for himself but unable to find peace of mind in a corrupt world of money and societal conventions, a world who looks innocent and glossy but hides a dark secret of prostitution and frail morals.
The cast is superb. The music is delightful. What a great idea they had to cast a now older Catherine Deneuve as the courtesan whom Swann loves devotedly, Odette. This DVD is a great experienc e and I recommend this film to fans of French classics. One note: the film takes place in the latter portions of Proust's epic novel, and some of the characters and side stories were cut off due to time. Like Gone With The Wind for America, Remembrance Of Things Past is an epic masterpiece of French literature. Only there they call it ""Au Recharche du Temps perdu"" which literally means, in Proustian symbolism, ""In Search Of Lost Time"".",1049500800,20,2012,4.868804664723032
1404105,4,B0000584ZF,"I watched this movie and I, honestly, understood it.  There were moments, as has been noted in other reviews, when the dialogue was ""impossible"" to to see, but it did not affect my understanding in separating all the characters or shifts in time and place which took place.  I have not read any of Proust books and currently I am reading a biography of him purchased here on Amazon.  I rented the movie first. I just like what I saw and decided the price of the DVD is worth it for a movie I found interesting and pleasurable.",1033084800,7,526,4.346938775510204
1404106,1,B0000584ZF,"I've rented ""Time Regained"" because I love period pieces...  I usually am able to enjoy subtitled movies even if I don't know
the language.  However, this one was a major disappointment.  Reading previous reviews and seeing that most people
thought this movie to be well made and enjoyable, I came up with 2 reasons why I didn't enjoy it myself, and these
two reasons seem to rely on each other - resolution of problem#1 seemed to depend on resolution of problem #2,
and vice versa:
1.  I did not read the book, thus was completely confused by the large number of characters and how they relate to each
other.  I was so confused by the names, that by the end of the movie, I only knew who Odette and ...  I cannt recall now
(and I only watched it this morning 8(  )...  well, the one starts with ""G"", played by Emmanuelle.  The time frames were
constantly shifting in the movie, so I thought that perhaps some of the actors are same characters, just portrayed
when young and then old.  But this realization didn't help me to keep them straight anyway.
2.  I do not understand a word of French.  The subtitles were white and often displayed on white background, thus
absolutely invisible.  No wonder I couldn't keep the characters straight, how could I if I couldn't even follow the story
due to inability to read the subtitles.
At the end of the movie, there was a scene of big party/concert.  It seemed to be important to me, because characters
were telling the main actor/narator about other guests' - I couldn't understand anything, who was related to who?
...  ...Basically everyone can see that I don't know who's who and what he is doing...
I beleive that if I read the book, I'd recognize the characters and knowing about them from the novel, I would
not be 100% depended on subtitles to tell me their life story.
So, my suggestion is either get familiar with the book first or
learn French(but I think reading the book is better).",1019520000,17,1938,4.528735632183908
1404107,2,B0000584ZF,"I desperately wanted and expected (because of the mostly positive reviews) to like Ruiz's take on the last installment of Proust's In Search of Lost Time, but after having viewed it--not once but twice--the best thing I can say about it is that it means well. Of course, I understand the difficulty of adapting such an involved, disjointed, and lengthy work, but Time Regained seems to miss the mark (dramatically) in a number of respects.
First and foremost, the film is simply unattractive. The film quality--in both the theatre prints and the DVD version--is grainy and drab, in a BBC-literary-adaptation kind of way. The colors appear washed out, and the art direction seems half-hearted. In short, I did not at all ""get a feeling"" of fin de siecle Paris--its elegance or its beauty. Some of the shots leave a distinct Made-for-Television taste in one's mouth.
Secondly, I have read the entire work, and yet at times I had some difficulty following the film (because of the collage-like style, the incorporation of scenes from various volumes, and an uncertainty as to which actors were playing whom). Meanwhile, Catherine Deneuve seems somewhat miscast as Odette de Forcheville nee Swann nee de Crecy--she is among the most elegant, refined, and put-together actresses in the film, and yet she is supposed to be playing the vulgar social-climbing outcast. The role of the narrator and of Gilberte (Emmanuel Beart) are well-cast, but the greatest of all miscalculations seems to be the casting of John Malkovich as the lecherous Baron de Charlus. He lacks the presence (both physical and social) that we would expect of this classic Proustian character.
The third and most damaging fault of the film is that it feels surprisingly soulless and cold. As we are bombarded with character after character, we are not given the opportunity of ""knowing"" or of even wanting to know any of them. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the novel was its long examinations of people, feelings, and sensations. This is inevitably lost in a film version and begs the question of whether Proust is suited to film at all. I can't think of a novel that better supports the argument that not all greats works of literature require film adaptations. Proust supplies us with more images and depth than a two-hour sitting in a movie theatre ever could.",987811200,32,2344,4.966921119592875
1404108,4,B0000584ZF,"This is a beautiful transfer to DVD of a superbly photographed, colorful film that recreates the French milieux of the early twentieth century  beautifully, and plays with time in a very Proustian way. I agree with your reviewer that the cast, except for John Malkovich, who is completely miscast as the aristocratic Charlus, is excellent. However, there a major drawback to this DVD: The subtitles cannot be turned off, which, if you know French and want to watch the film without them, is a great pity. Also, it must be pointed out (again, as your reviewer did) that the film, gorgeous and atmospheric as it is, is wonderful if you know Proust's book, but could be rather confusing if you don't.

1404109,5,B0000584ZF,"Ruiz's version of Proust's monumental work probably comes as close to a faithful interpretation of the spirit of the original work as a film can get.  While the movie focuses on the last volume of the novel, key elements of the whole are interwoven throughout, to brilliant effect.  Ruiz's surrealistic touches are at times so achingly beautiful that it takes your breath away.  Ruiz made some interesting (and brave) choices regarding the plot: Swann and Albertine are jettisoned entirely, and believe it or not, it still works.  The casting is uncannily on the money, with the one exception of John Malkovitch as Charlus, who appears not to have the foggiest conception of the character as written by Proust.  If you haven't guessed already, this film will be tough going for those unfamiliar with the book. For Proustians: an unmitigated feast.",982281600,45,847,5.021428571428571

The actors are beautiful...the costumes are beautiful...the sets and the scenery are beautiful...the music is beautiful...the French language, even if one does not speak French, is beautiful.  If one wishes to get the most out of this film, of course, one either should read A la recherch du temps or at least read about it before viewing.

People unfamiliar with the books, won't understand much at first, as all the characters are introduced as someone you already  knew. Still, I think the movie can be very rewarding even with no knowledge of the book.

1404115,2,B0000584ZF,"My wife who read Proust's works in French liked this movie. I haven't read any Proust so I was completely lost and gave up after the first hour. I got tired of bothering her to ask who was who and what was happening but I kept wandering back to the TV to catch parts of it. I don't recommend this film to anyone unfamiliar with the novels. Characters and events move back & forth in time and if that's not confusing enough, sometimes they appear in the past and present at the same time. She later admitted she lost interest at times and fought off dozing due to the slow pageant-like pacing. This is a demanding film that requires your absolute attention, preferably when you're not tired.

I firmly believe the French make the best costume films and this film is a perfect example. Although the handsome period sets and costumes are finely detailed, they are marred by the too dark photography during the indoor scenes. To make matters worse, the white subtitles are hard to read at times because the letters lack black borders making them impossible to read against white or light backgrounds.

The actors seemed good matches for their characters but listening to John Malkovich speak drawling phonetic French is bizarre if not funny.

Film adapted from novels should stand on their own without the viewer having to read the novel beforehand in order to follow it. 'Time Regained' is probably the best example of not being able to follow a film unless you read the novel, or to make it worse, and the other related novels.

For Proust fans ONLY and those fluent in French due to the bad subtitling.",1325203200,6,1601,4.626760563380282

In the 1999 film/DVD version under review here, the viewer tracks the life of the author, Marcel Proust (1871-1922), out of sequence, as the protagonist of the original novel mentally relives a retrospective of his past. He attempts to complete his great novel from his deathbed so we see his interactions from that perspective, and intermittently as vignettes of his past. It's this aspect of the film which might generate great confusion for some viewers who are unfamiliar with Proust's Magnum opus novel, additionally complicated by the fact that the novel itself is conveyed by the most lyrical of prose and as through a diaphanous lens, some in real time and some in retrospect. The setting is early 20th Century France. The backdrop for the film is largely that of World War I.

Proust wrote of a strange life, at least from a contemporary paradigm. He tells of life among the nobility in Paris and at other locations such as Balbec. His relatives were quite the sheltering kind and there seems to be an invisible shield over him from that point forward. Life experiences for him run the gambit from venomous gossip to homosexual brothels. Proust always seems to be on the outside looking in to the lives of this collection of musicians, writers, military officers, nobles and the like, most of whom manifest some pretty bizarre affinities.

For those who know Proust, yes, you'll get [the odious] Odette, Gilberte, St. Loup, and Albertine... in fact one is exposed to most of the prime players of the novel, albeit often in little more than a flash.

I loved the cinematography of this film which features very strong and hazy backlighting, particularly during Proust's periods of reminiscing; however, this gives rise to a great problem for the typical American viewer: the film is conveyed in the French language with English subtitles which frequently disappear into the intense backlighting. I more-or-less guesstimated that I was deprived of between 2-4 percent of the dialogue. The translation itself was excellent but those quirky subtitles were quite discouraging at times -- a great shame!

The international slate of actors includes Catherine Deneuve, Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, Vincent Perez, and John Malkovich (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beowulf-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0011NVC9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beowulf (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>.)

For me, I can hardly generate adequate praise for this pure art film... but then I've recently read the novel. But, on the other hand, I would not wish in any way to discourage anyone from taking in this fine dramatic film.

1404117,5,B0000584ZF,"Taking the concept of less is more ,writer-director Raoul Ruiz,has somehow summarized the 7 books of Proust's magnum opus,Remembrance of Things Past, into a 2.5 hour film. He does this by taking the last part,Time Regained, but also shooting episodes from earlier volumes of the novel. The film blends the life of Proust,the author,with that of his fictional alter ego,Marcel,the novel's narrator. Proust is on his death-bed in 1922,reciting his magnum opus to his house-keeper,'he's nearing the end' as another character says. As Proust looks at some old photographs, in his mind's eye he becomes his narrator Marcel(Mazzerella),a man of bourgeois origins,fascinated by the social elite of Paris. Marcel's reveries are shown in a kaleidoscopic sequence of short scenes where most of the film's major characters,settings and themes are introduced. He recalls the parties,friendships,love affairs and falling-outs that mark the years before and during WW 1. At a reception given by the Prince and Princess de Guermantes, awaiting the finish of a musical interlude,an upsurge of familiar sensations washes over him. These sensations, resembling the Madeleine incident of the opening pages,set off a great sunburst of memory reaching all the way back to his earliet childhood and his mother reading to him in Combray.

This extraordinary film gives the unwieldy novel a second order currency in our culture. The subject of the novel is involuntary memory,the aesthetic framing of desire,how far we can retrieve our past selves,how little we can control the people we love,and the rediscovery of a vocation to write,the refinding of his lost calling from his own erring life. Gilberte's giving him Goncourt's Journal reminds him of all the people he has come to know.

Ruiz captures the sensuous texture of the prose by turning the language of the novel into a pool of cinematic images which we go in and it carries us along. Using stunning cinematography and a star-studded cast(Malkovitch, Beart,Deneuve,Perez,Mazarella) the techniques used are strange camera angles,slow motion,dream-like sequences, images that fuse together,moving platforms,moving back and forth in time,to capture the twilight zone between consciousness and unconsciousness in which the novel takes place. The book begins with a man and then a boy not being able to get to sleep. The movie seems at first viewing to be so difficult. The primary reason for this is that the film, in imitation of involuntary memory, does not present events in chronological order. Also we may get the older and younger Marcel in the same scene, the mixing of real life characters with fictional ones. Recreating the timelessness of Proust's work,'Time Regained 'is a fascinating exploration of the relationship between the writer and his creations and is a truly stunning achievement. A creation independent of the novel.",1273622400,4,2872,5.365853658536586

Soit. But there are things I missed. The entire tone is distressingly downbeat and utterly lacks Prousts borderline slapstick. Also missing is the complex psychology and the multiple facets, changing over time, of each persona. One effect of Prousts psychology, also missing, is the profound benevolence and tolerance in the grand tradition of Montaigne and Molire. There is no mention of the Dreyfus Affair and we are left with only a passing allusion to the anti-semitism of French high society.
Why did the cinematography have to have an overlay of a wash of puke yellow? Memory, I get it, but perhaps there would have been a better way such as the superb palette in Stephen Frears' Chri. Indeed why was there such a general atmosphere of physical ugliness especially among the secondary female characters? There is absolutely no sense as to why Marcel would have found this world glamorous.
There are a few imbalances but those will only bother us Proust purists. Swann is only someone people talk about and WTF! Albertine a disparu! Dsol je nai pas pu y rsister. Odette and Gilberte who are somewhat immaterial in Proust and don't talk much are given pride of place. Well, if I could cast Deneuve and Bart I would turn the entire film over to them (Also Mazzarella who is a dead ringer for the Proust we see in the few surviving photos.) Deneuve is an improved actress in her sunset years and Barts beauty alone is worth the price of admission.
Casting issues: Chiara Mastroianni is much too old for Albertine who died, I believe, while still a teenager. Blochs American girlfriend speaks English with some sort of Russian accent. Worst of all is Malkovich who is totally miscast as Charlus. Wheres the military bluster? I suppose the French will accept his accent as long as they could land a big Hollywood star. But if you're going to cast an English speaker as a Pair de France Rex Harrison or Peter OToole (Too bad they're dead) or even Kurt Russell (lol) would have been better.",1475193600,3,2166,4.7026315789473685
7933043,5,B0000584ZF,"I've read and re-read Proust over the years, and also read a lot of critical work about him. I still find parts of this film utterly baffling, but I keep going back to it. (Is it possible to wear out a DVD ?) It's a beautifully made meditation on Proust and his book, and it bases itself on his final volume, with flashbacks. There are details which Ruiz has taken from other writings by Proust, and from his biography - so he's not working just from a single source. The acting is excellent in general - though I find Malkovich unconvincing as Charlus.
There are times when I question my judgement, and wonder if I enjoy the film because it reminds me of the book. But I've seen the ludicrous ""Swann in Love"" once, and don't intent to repeat the experience, so..............",1424044800,2,775,4.464788732394366

7933045,5,B0000584ZF,"Along with Swann in Love starring Jeremy Irons, Time Regained works equally well as a companion piece to the books and on its own. While Swann in Love evokes romantic despair and regret (and the ultimate acceptance of both), Time Regained is giddily nostalgic. You feel like you're reliving your own life at the same time the main character and narrator, Marcel, is reliving his.",1413936000,,379,4.846153846153846
7933046,1,B0000584ZF,"This film at best, is nothing but amateurish detritus which not only bores the viewer but makes him contemptuously dislike all forms of snobbery or upper middle class portraits.

I've read a few of the other reviewers who attempt to become apologists for the director's lack of talent at establishing even a modicum of interest, they say if you haven't read Proust then you will have a difficult time comprehending this, which in itself is entirely fatuous and pomp. Imagine everyone having to read one of the most lurid and over-rated books of the 20th century to see a film which should substantiate itself. What an exaggerated claim. There's no place for ""intellectual hubris"" or their own ""in-group manifesto"" here.

I had high hopes for this film actually but after the first hour I saw that it was devoid and lacking any duality which would allow us to reflect on what is occurring. It is played by rigid, high handed oafs who are spoiled to begin with.

Most of the first hour is infested by artless vignettes which are probably the deluded Proust's memory, and they are reworked in such a disordered way that what comes out is merely a bunch of meaningless, trite and vacuous scenes with banal jargon, not only because they hold absolutely no interest for us, but because they do not invite a further contemplation of what 'time' was to Proust, imagine listening to a bunch of snobs talk about the weather, well, that is what this basically is, how philosophical can one get from that point of reference? It begins to wear thin after the first scene and you pray that there will be no more discussions by those prosaic characters. And it doesn't help that Proust himself is an insipid dandy who parades around in his best suits with his neatly trimmed moustache and becomes a voyeur, if you are asleep already, I don't blame you.

Many of the scenes deal with characters which are entirely void of any human warmth or expression, they are petty aristocrats, snobs who sit and drink tea and eat stuffy food while looking down at the poor. They are [...] who visit [...] brothels and think themselves noble because they hold high office positions during the war while the common man spills his guts out at the front lines. This is a complete waste of time!

Malkovich is even an absurd caricature in here, and his little dubbed French voice is entirely insipid. I laughed at most of this. We learn that he is a libertine who likes to visit male brothels and be whipped by sincere proletarian scum, wow, what a revelation on the mystery of human existence. From the looks of the period pieces and the arrangements, it was expensive but that doesn't carry a film with people walking around with no reference to the viewer. Film is supposed to move us in a way, either disgust us or interest us in some form of merit which it presents itself to us in human understanding but boredom to me is no artistic achievement. Don't even bother with this pretentious and ennui filled work.",1390435200,,2982,4.650853889943074
