8496102,2,B006BI7AK8,"I have watched this two disc program, Untouched by Man, twice so far and I must say it is not so special as one would think by the cover photo. There were no reviews when I bought this set ,so I wasn't sure what to expect of this Documentary. Being a 2011 release and for $35.00, I Thought I was getting something with at least  standard definition. The visuals all through both programs are blurry or a better word Grainy. I believe this to be of old video tape quality transferred to dvd. Being full screen is ok with me and I did try to enjoy the many short segments just under 6 minutes for some and some were less. The narration and the different animals on  land and  under the sea was cool,but the grainy video quality Killed my interest watching this and just made it difficult  to see and to rate it a 5 star documentary. Also before each segment plays, Type writing clicking on screen with very limited information was annoying. It posted information such as destination, most common animals in this location etc. This is good and educational ,I agree but being that the segments are so short it intervenes with the  normal viewing and made it less enjoyable for me to watch. Proper Editing could have put this in as bonus material separately. I would recommend  National Geographic: World's Last Great places Collection in place of this set. You get a 6 disc set each at 60 minuits for a few dollars more.",1401235200,,1416,4.4689922480620154
