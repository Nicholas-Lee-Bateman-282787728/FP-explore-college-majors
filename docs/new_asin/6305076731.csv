959777,3,6305076731,Mildly humorous. I am buying comedies for $5 and under as I have given up on cable and internet. Not worth the cost and the lack of customer service. It has been a month since I watched this movie and I can just vaguely remember what it was about. I do remember that Jennifer Aniston's character annoyed me . She wanted people to bend to her wishes.

959779,4,6305076731,"Review of The Object of my Affection
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Bring your Kleenexes! Okay, youve been warned.

In The Object of my Affection, two actors whose careers have previously been tied to teen-oriented comedies are finally given the chance to show the world they can act. Paul Rudd plays the male lead, a gay man who cares deeply for his female friend. His sensitivity and subtlety in the role is incredible. In a decade when including a gay character in a movie usually went hand-in-hand with a flamboyant performance, its wonderful to see him give his character a realistic, subdued performance.

Jennifer Aniston, previously associated with flighty behavior in a coffee shop, has real challenges in this movie. Her character is involved with a less-than-stellar boyfriend, and when she finds out shes pregnant, she has to decide whether to return to her boyfriend, or go it alone. And while shes deciding, she just might develop some inappropriate feelings for her sympathetic, caring friend.

This is a heavy drama, and definitely not one to watch if youve just had your heart broken. Even if you're not normally inclined to watch something this heavy, consider stretching your boundaries for this one. Paul Rudds performance is worth it.",1497225600,,1255,5.019230769230769

I can see why so many people liked the warm and fluffy feel good aspect, but even that element of this movie fell flat. It had it's moments, but mostly I stand by the 2 1/2 star critique.

960137,2,6305076731,"very smoothly written and performed, it attempts to love all over jennifer's gay pal, as their relationship deepens to the level of a romance.  in the meantime, jennifer's equally welcoming fiance finds himself increasingly distanced, as the dramedic duo veers towards a marriage (his expected child included) that will sideline him.  as he is a rather frenetic boor, j finds herself increasingly smitten by all the ingredients of an unintended courtship, save one (no funny business, just entrancing charm).  unlike the film, i will not require two solid hours to come to the point.  it turns out (wouldn't you JUST know it) that although rudd is an ideal friend, he is incapable of sustaining the obligations of a husband and father as (being gay) he is irrestibly compelled to prowl and trick, instead of hanging with his betrothed.  i have indeed seen gay straight marriages break up, but i have also seen them work.  the film seizes upon a fraction of the truth and dilates it into a whole.  jennifer is guided away from the disastrous error she is about to commit by a wise and worldly homo yoda, and everyone ends appropriately; j is wedded to her imperfect but logically heterosexual fiance, rudd assumes the reduced station of a faux uncle, and we are regaled with an ""all's well"" ending.  a textbook perfect one.  however, the thing about textbooks to beware of is their idealizations; and this one idealizes a lie.",1401235200,,1425,4.855371900826446

When Nina becomes pregnant, she realizes she'd rather raise her child with George than with her boyfriend - a decision that forces the threesome to explore the fine line between love, sex and friendship.

960143,5,6305076731,"This scenario is highly realistic and demonstrates the conflicts between emotionally one-sided love and the powerful friendships between gay men and straight women... and, the complications that may result.

Paul Rudd is a sweet, charming, goodlooking GAY schoolteacher who everyone adores... including his new best friend and roommate, Jennifer Aniston...  SPOILER:  Basically, Jennifer falls in love with Paul and this creates an ever-growing difficulty of unrequited love which puts Paul in a bind while both try to deal with the facts of life:  no matter how much a straight woman and a gay man love each other, sexual satisfaction and romantic attachments are not going to occur for most and lead to a pulling, tugging, dragging contradictory relationship that can hurt all.  Jennifer unwittingly falls for Paul while he tries his best to reciprocate FRIENDSHIP while keeping boundaries... unfortunately, easier said than done.

This is a beautifully portrayed story with classic values epitomized by both our main characters who are surrounded with other dramas, comedic and otherwise... by a great supporting cast.  This movie may not be new, but it is an eye opener for many who assume too much in this world... not all is as it appears and we may never know what's going to happen next in life, but we should be grateful for all the good we can get from every relationship - however it may be defined.

960165,3,6305076731,"I have given this 3 stars because it was well crafted and poignant.  That is not to say that I enjoyed it.  The film was not directed towards me.  This is a gay film, which is not a criticism at all but merely that the audience is that and not straight men.  Every scene is crafted to that end.  Moreover, the wondrous Jennifer Aniston that many of us came to adore from other films and Friends is not present.  She's on the screen, to be sure, but the mature, sultry, even sexy Ms. Anniston is AWOL; in her place is a vulnerable, insecure sensitive single who must choose between 'traditional' and...'differently oriented', i.e. straight vs. gay.

To sum up, if you like the idea of a woman having to decide between a sensitive, caring gay man vs. a 'normal guy' who has 'it all' except for any heart or personality, then this is an excellent portrayal and you should love it.  If, on the other hand, you were looking for a romantic comedy with the gorgeous Jennifer Aniston as the lovable vamp, then by all means buy one of her latest films which are all of that and more.  This is a poignant character portrayal only...

Sidebar: I could have sworn this film was 'rated' R when I bought it; I note it now has no rating shown.  Well, unless you are a prude and are shocked at any aspect of the gay life, the film was easily ratable as 'PG' or 'PG-13' at the most...",1385078400,2,1367,4.30078125

This time around when I watched it, I realized how sad it was in much of the movie.  It still has that old fashioned 60's movie feel to it, and the actors are awesome.  The ending is happy, but I felt something lacking this time.  It seemed that Jennifer's character should have been aware of the possibilities of raising a child a with a gay man rather than expect things to be the same and to NOT fall in love with him!  She is young but I think women have figured out that they cannot turn a gay man to the other team.  I guess I've matured a bit.",1366156800,,675,4.030075187969925

I liked this move, somewhat, as bad and trite as it may be, it was sincere,  I LOVE Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston, they are perfectly cast...but this movie is in no way like the book.  The original story is very focused on the male character and his pursuit to find true love and understanding.  It is less about Nina, the pregnant room-mate he is forced to live with here.  She is an important character of course, but really more a secondary character to the story.  She never tries to pursue him or beg for his affections like a lonely wet dog.  She's quite the contrary.  A tougher stronger woman than portrayed here.  Many of the other characters, and certainly the events in this book, have been altered and or changed within this script to appease a STRAIGHTER audience.  Especially George's past and future relationships with men.  The man he actually falls in love with in the end is a completely different story.  A touching and tender discovery of love and fear...that ends happily for the gays for once!  Typical Hollywood.  They should have just made a great movie based on a great book. It could have been up there with Brokeback Mountain as a film that truly deals with an honest portrayal of the gay psyche and homosexual intimacy that will forever possess your heart and soul

SERIOUSLY - read this book.  It is one of my favorites.  It is truly sad they could not honor Stephen McCauley's touching work.  It's a shame.",1279065600,,1461,4.596899224806202

960287,5,6305076731,"""The Object of My Affection"" explores the isssue of straight women falling in love with gay men. This topic is even more prevailent in 2009, what with ""American Idol"" and Adam Lambert in which many women are in love with him, despite the fact that he is gay. Women have always felt a strong connection to male homosexuals for we, as gay guys, can be very affectionate, articulate, sensitive, and artistic, something that straight men can sometimes lack.
 Jennifer Aniston, from TV's ""Friends"", stars as Nina, who is pregnant, and decides she wants to raise the child with her best friend George, who is gay and an elementary school teacher. Paul Rudd, who plays George, portrays his character in a positive manner, ignoring all the gay cliches that are sometimes prevailent in gay characterizations in films. George is straight-looking, beautiful to look at, and very much a man. He also has all the qualities that Nina's boyfriend doesn't possess, which is one of the reasons she falls in love with George, knowing  a romance between them will never come to pass. ""The Object Of My Affection"" is a beautiful love story between two adult people who love one another, a love story unlike any I have seen in film. The writing is excellent, the performances flawless as we really feel for these people, and the directing is dead on.
 The DVD comes with tons of bonuses, including the original trailer, a featurette, TV spots, dolby sound, and it comes with english and spanish subtitles. Critics hailed this movie: Rex Reed called it ""absolutely enchatting"", and Peter Travers says, it is ""memorably funny and touching"".",1241222400,,1617,4.894160583941606

Aniston and Rudd make a lovable couple whom we all root for, even though we know it won't and can't work.  Screenwriter Wasserstein has written a Shakepearean comedy of desperate tears that comes to a happy ending, with all the people sorting themselves out into the right mates: straights go with straights, gays with gays, and everyone lives happily ever after. The actors are 'stars' but they seem very unglamorous;  Rudd and Aniston are cute without the kind of extraordinary beauty that makes some stars seem above common struggles. The actors here persuasively ordinary. He plays a school teacher, while she is a social worker. All of this is believable. The loving relationship between the two is enviably pleasant, very roommatey, indeed, reminding one of best friends in college.

I enjoyed the realistic scenes of gay/straight interaction -- people of all ages and sexuality mixing it up without awkwardness or poisonous jealousy.

This film has its faults, but I love the way Paul Rudd isn't playing a stereotypical gay guy with the hands & everything. Plus, he's also (as far as I know) a straight guy, playing a gay guy, who also managed to do a full-on kiss with another guy.

Object Of My Affection was a very true to life film, considering many women fall in love with gay guys, or who happen to be their best friends, and think they can 'change' them. They've never met the right women etc. All the feelings flow through in Jennifer Aniston's portrayal of Nina in this.

Oh my God though, this film must have been so hard to film. Apart from the guy-on-guy kiss, Paul Rudd has admitted to him & Jennifer not getting on during the filming, and I can't remember exactly what he said, but it wasn't nice. And it shows in the movie! They seem almost like they're going through the motions with their lines. Paul also appeared in the last two series of Friends, as Phoebe's boyfriend (and then husband) Mike, but notably, never appeared in a single scene with Jennifer, only in group scenes, and they were never placed near each other. Wow.

This won't appeal to many people, and could easily have been a TV movie shown during the day, or late at night. It's unoffensive, cheap & cheerful. There's no features on the version I have, not a trailer or nothing.",1121731200,,1603,4.2805280528052805
960345,4,6305076731,"It seems that many people think that this script was implausible.  I actually feel that several of the situations are fairly true-to-life, ESPECIALLY the case of a straight girl falling in love with her gay friend.

I think that it is true that most people do not believe that we can change a person's sexual preference.  But I also think that when women get involved emotionally with a man, they naturally begin to have physical feelings for him as well.  Nina's boyfriend says as much to George at one point.

Some may think the script is clunky, and maybe it isn't smooth Hollywood romantic comedy at it's best, but that adds to the realism.  This film is not a comedy, and to market it as such is probably what made so many disappointed viewers.  This is a heartbreaking tale of modern unrequited love.

960347,4,6305076731,"Jennifer Aniston (TV's ""Friends"", 1994-2004) and Paul Rudd (""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"", 1996) star in the 1998 comedy ""The Object of My Affection"".  Nina (Aniston) is dating a man with whom she is not truly in love.  Suddenly, she discovers she's pregnant.  One day, she meet George (Rudd) who is gay.  George moves in with Nina, and they become sudden friends.  Meanwhile, Nina offers George the fatherhood role since the real father is arrogant.  As the events fold one on one, the storyline leads this film to a surprising conclusion that will leave audiences breathless.

Occassionally, the storyline can turn confusing.  However, the humor is always present.  Yet, it has a good heart.  Therefore, the events remain interesting throughout the film.  The humoristic theme combines well with the dramatic and the serious sides.  Though some of the humor is often written in other films, it remains as funny as if it was original.  As many films joke with the gay issues too much, this portrays them as regular people making a living.  There are no typical stereotypes through the characters that turn crude.

Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd create the great chemistry within their lead performances that makes this film shine much more.  The humoristic side is expressed wonderfully with their actions and words.  Aniston's unique acting style creatively gives this film new dimension.  Rudd wonderfully switches from humorous to dramatic without any sudden interruptions while fitting with the film beautifully.

""The Object of My Affection"" is a must-have for any Jennifer Aniston fan or those wanting a comedy.  This will surely please its audiences in unique ways.",1115424000,,1683,5.162962962962963
960348,4,6305076731,"Romantic drama with a relatively light touch, Jennifer Aniston (Nina)and Paul Rudd (George) are convincing as a social worker and gay teacher who confront the emotional boundaries of love between ""straight"" and ""gay"". Excellent supporting cast includes Alan Alda (""M.A.S.H.""), Nigel Hawthorne (""Yes, Prime Minister"") and John Pankow as Vince, Nina's boyfriend and father to her unborn child.

The plot - Nina wants George, rather than Vince, to be the father of her child - is a vehicle for exploring not only the different attitudes informing hetero- and homosexual love, but of those differences between men and women. Nigel Hawthorne's character Rodney, a ""gay"" theatre critic living in an unrequited relationship with a young gay actor, eloquently summarises the dilemma facing people in love, in a  genuinely heartfelt moment towards the film's end. Rodney questions Nina's resolve to have a gay man be the father of her child: ""don't fix your life so that you're left alone ...when you come to the middle of it"".

The final scene then neatly, and without any hint of irony, subverts Rodney's advice by fixing Nina to be Mom to George's gay Dad.

Despite the feel-good slipperiness of the ending, the film does attempt to address the notion of ""love"" beyond the borders of standard Hollywood hyperbole, and should be commended for doing so.

Jennifer Aniston is perfectly cast as the lead character, Nina Borowski, and gives an excellent performance that making the viewer feel what she's feeling.  Paul Rudd, as her roommate and eventual love interest, is very appealing too.  (In my opinion, he doesn't really seem gay, but then again he doesn't really need to.  As long as the viewer just accepts the fact that he IS, it works.) John Pankow is great as Nina's irritating boyfriend, Vince.  And of course, Nigel Hawthorne does a wonderful job as Rodney.  Big surprise.
The best scene in the film is a scene where Nina's overbearing sister, Constance (Allison Janney), descends on Nina and George along with her equally annoying husband (Alan Alda) and daughter (Lauren Pratt).  It is so funny, and so well acted.
All in all, The Object Of My Affection rates five stars in my book.

960396,3,6305076731,"What most of you probably don't know is that this movie is ""very loosely"" based on a book by Stephen McCauley. In other words the book and the movie are very very different. I watched the movie first and liked it because I thought it was fairly original in that it was very different from any other romantic comedy I had ever seen before. It was only by complete accident that I later found out that this movie was inspired by a book. After reading the book, I went back and re-watched the movie, and thought to myself, this movie is an absolute insult to McCauley's book.
The thing that I am most upset at the movie for is having Nina fall in love with George, because THIS NEVER HAPPENS IN THE BOOK. In the book Nina and George only love each other as friends and Nina never tries to seduce George like she does in the movie.
There are many other huge differences between the book and the movie.  Like the fact that Paul, George's new love interest, is not an aspiring actor who lives with a critic named Rodney.  In the book, Paul lives in a small town in Vermont and is the writer of the town's newspaper. He also has a son named Gabriel, whom he adopted from a country in either South or Central America. It is not until George meets Paul and Gabriel that he agrees to help Nina raise her baby. What is really funny is that so much time has passed between the time that Nina originally asked George to help her raise the baby and the time that he accepts her proposal that by the time he tells her he wants to help her she has begun to think that her idea was not a very good one in the first place. She grudgingly accepts his offer to help her with the baby and basically tells him that she really doesn't expect this to be a permanent situation.
In the movie Constance is Nina's stepsister, and in the book Constance is a somewhat mutual friend of Nina and Joley's. Nina and George do meet at Constance's party, and Joley does tell Nina that George needs a new place to live before he ever tells George that they are breaking up. However, in the movie George and Joley have been together for 4 years, and in the book they have been together for less than a year.
In the movie George's brother, Frank, lives in New York and they have a pretty good relationship with each other. In fact, George is Frank's best man in his wedding. In the book, Frank lives in Boston and invites George and Nina to the wedding hoping that he can pass off Nina as George's girlfriend so that his fiancee and her conservative family will not find out that his brother is gay. When George and Nina arrive in Boston and Frank finds out that she is pregnant and cannot hide that fact he becomes very upset and demands that George and Nina make up a story that they were secretly married because of the baby. This offends George and he ends up not even attending his brother's wedding.
In the movie, Vince is the father of Nina's child and is extremely resentful of her relationship with George. In the book, Howard is the name of Nina's boyfriend and she does not even meet him until after George has moved into her apartment. Howard and George become good friends and after Nina breaks up with Howard, George often remarks about how much he misses having Howard come to visit them. George also spends a good bit of the time trying to get Nina and Howard back on speaking terms with each other because he does not like it that Nina wants to exclude Howard from the raising of his child.

960400,3,6305076731,"Is it just me, or does every Hollywood film that has a main character who is gay fall into soap opera? And why do such films seem to go out of their way to offend no one, and as a result, prove unsatisfactory to all groups?
These questions plagued me while watching ""The Object of my Affection"". It's actually a rather sweet film and seems at times to be heartfelt. There are parts that are quite funny. You might say that it succeeds on a sort of 'sit com' level.
This would be fine, if it's creators didn't insist on touching on some very emotional issues, all of which they back away from in one of the most implausible happy endings in recent memory.
Jennifer Anniston, of the smash hit TV series ""Friends"", plays Nina, a fairly sophisticated New York girl who's in love with an obnoxious Socialist. When she meets George, played by Paul Rudd, she's offers him her spare bedroom when she learns he's just been dumped by his boyfriend of four years.
Nina and George develop a close friendship. The film's makers do a good job of depicting how this relationship develops by showing scenes in different seasons. Real friendships do, after all, take some time to develop.
After a while Nina finds herself pregnant by her boyfriend, who is less than pleased by this development. George, who teaches first grade in a posh private school, adores children. Nina gets dumped by the boyfriend, and George agrees to be the surrogate father.
All goes along nicely until Nina falls in love with George. What seemed on paper to be a good plot device nearly derails the film. I say this for two reasons. One is that informed people no longer attempt to change someone's sexual preference. If Nina had been naive, we could see her not knowing any better. But she's too worldly to think that changing George would work. The other reason is that this takes a hip comedy and smothers it in soap opera.
Another failing is that George, while not boring, is a character so perfect that he's a candidate for sainthood. I think even the most bigoted viewer would have related better to him had he been just a little raunchy.
There are some memorable supporting roles, including Alan Alda, as a literary agent, and Allison Janey as his social climbing wife are hysterical. These two take name dropping to new heights.
The wonderful British actor, Niger Hawthorne, plays perhaps the most true to life character. An aging critic, he has allowed a young drama student to live with him. He is wise enough to know that the age difference makes a love affair impossible. Yet when the young student falls for George, you can see how painful it is for Hawthorne's character. The need to be loved does not diminish with age. Hawthorne gives the best and most poignant performance in the film.

In her place is Nigle Hawthorne, doing his damned best with a pointless character.  Also, the wonderful Alison Janney is in here in a role that was also NOT in the book.

960457,5,6305076731,"I have to admit that this is a favorite movie of mine and I'm thrilled that it's finally coming to DVD.  It's hardly challenging.  It's not political.  There's nothing outstanding about the filmmaking technique.  It's simply a pleasant diversion, and as such, I enjoy it a great deal.  And while it goes out of its way not to offend anyone, it does break some new ground in terms of mainstream Hollywood movies.
The story centers around the friendship of a gay schoolteacher, George (Paul Rudd), who is dumped by his boyfriend.  (...)
It's a charming movie, with terrific performances throughout.  Rudd and Anniston share terrific chemistry together.  White is appropriately sleazy.  Allison Janney and Alan Alda as Nina's sister and brother-in-law offer hilarious support.  And Nigel Hawthorne as Paul's mentor, provides the movie with heart and soul.  Pulitzer-prize winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein adapts Stephen McCauley's novel, and the script is solid.  Nicholas Hytner's direction is assured.  The movie is filled with laughs and genuine emotion.  The scene in the gym where Nina confronts Stephen packs incredible power.
Some have complained that George is too perfect and too nice--that the filmmakers were so concerned about having the mainstream audience accept him as a character that they went out of his way to make him bland and inoffensive.  There might be a little truth in that, but I think Rudd's performance makes the character feel genuine at all times.  (...)
However, the one thing that really pleases me about this movie is that it was the first mainstream Hollywood movie that allowed its gay character to be gay.  (I exclude ""Torch Song Trilogy"" from this analysis as TST was about gay relationships.)  Up to this point, gay characters were everybody's best friend or problem.  Window dressing to offer witty banter or to show us how liberal our heterosexual leads were.  The gay characters were only gay because we were told they were--they were never allowed to have a romance of their own.  Their love lives were always non-existent.  The fact that George not only meets another guy and dates him.  They have a genuine romantic and sexual relationship, something that most mainstream Hollywood movies rarely addressed with their gay male characters, unless as a ""problem.""
I have no idea what, if any extras, will be on the DVD.  Frankly, I don't care.  I'll be happy enough just to have it on DVD.  But, once it has come out (as it were), I will revisit this review to discuss said extras (should there be some of note).
If you like this movie, then I strongly recommend:  ""Trick"", ""The Broken Hearts Club"", ""Broadway Damage"", ""Just One Time"", ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"", ""Torch Song Trilogy"", ""9 to 5"" (no gay content, but a very funny comedy), and (begrudgingly as it is not nearly as good as the other movies on this list as it is very coy about the homosexuality of its characters), ""In & Out"".

Girl's confused, guy goes off, girl is sad, they come back together and that's the end. I was very off base. This is a sweet romantic dramedy (comedy/drama) that makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. Paul Rudd plays a gay school teacher, who (after finding out his current relationship is over) moves in with his new friend (Aniston). When she discovers that she is pregnant, she decides that she wants Rudd to be the father figure for the child...which is not what her boyfriend wants. This intricate story is so delicately done, that (unlike most movies) it seems to be glass. The supporting characters are wonderfully lovable/loathsome. No revelations seem too spontaneous, but are eased into, making it a lovely and enjoyable film. One of those movies that makes you want to be in the characters world and shout ""YOU SHOULD BE TOGETHER!""

This film attempts to address the age-old problem of straight woman falling for sweet gay guy, and succeeds in some degree at getting its point across.
This film also reveals to us that Macy Gray has been around for quite a while. The soundtrack plays her hit 'I Try' which wasn't released officially until 1999. Just a bit of useless trivia for you!

960513,5,6305076731,"With the ""gay 90's"" in full steam, the producers at Twentieth Century Fox decided that they would produce a film that would represent the relationship a young urban woman and her gay male friend have while trying to rebound from broken relationships. That film, ""The Object of My Affection"" takes a major turn from the traditional Hollywood love story of the past.
Nina, played by Jennifer Aniston (television's ""Friends""; ""Office Space"") and George, played by the lovable Paul Rudd (""Clueless""; ""William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet"") are roommates living in New York City. George, who recently broke up with his boyfriend played by Tim Daly (television's ""Wings"") takes up Nina offer to room with her, but by doing so, it appears that both of them will be spending a lot of time together, almost like a couple.
Nina's infatuation with George begins to grow, and although he is gay, her attraction and love for him thrives in her. As the film progresses, Nina asks George if he wants to help her raise her unborn child together as a couple, and he agrees. Yet, love steps in the way as George meets a young actor that sweeps him off his feet. Soon there is little time for Nina, and the plot continues as it explores the aftermath of Nina and George's once brief, non-sexual relationship.
Director Nicholas Hytner does an excellent job in capturing Rudd and Aniston's charm onscreen. Both actors are excellent, and I must admit that Rudd's character is so adorable and cute, that it will make every straight woman want a gay friend like him in their lives. The film, which ends on a happy note, could have been a bit much more better if we got more of the outcome from George's and Nina's new romances.
""The Object of My Affection"" is one of the cutest romances to come out in years. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand what life for a single woman and gay male in the big city can be.

George (Rudd) is the homosexual nursery school teacher who moves in  with Nina after his boyfriend rudely dumps him.  The friendship that ensues  between Nina and George is touching and engrossing.

I might even want to watch this again. Ms. Aniston and Paul Rudd's acting were great. I was watching early on to see how he would portray himself as gay and I think he got it across. I really enjoyed this. Ms. Aniston as always turned out a stellar performance with wistfulness and tears as one would expect. I loved it.",1519776000,,465,4.177777777777778
