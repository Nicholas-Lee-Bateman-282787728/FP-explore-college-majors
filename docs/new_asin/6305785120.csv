7894453,5,6305785120,"Produced in association with the Discovery Channel, this  documentary has assembled some of the most fascinating facts now known about the animals on this planet. The film footage is fabulous, and the explanatory graphics help us understand how the survival mechanisms of certain animals work.
Starting with the harsh temperatures of the Arctic winter, we see how polar bears endure the climate with their protective layers and acute sense of smell. The underwater footage of the bears swimming is marvelous.
The film then moves south to Antarctica, and to penguins and how they survive.
The extraordinary vision of the eagle is examined, and the keen olfactory talents of the wolf and salmon.
Of the many animals in this film, the section on horses is my favorite; they show them running wild, and describe how they sleep standing up. Now when I see a horse in the position they show, I will know it is taking a power nap !
The digestive system of the crocodile is fascinating, but a warning to parents of young children, as there is a brief moment of violence in this section, as a croc devours a very large creature.
Woodpeckers, zebras, spider's webs, the communication skills of the elephant, the migration of the monarch butterfy, how dolphins see with sound, the ocean depths a whale can go to, and a variety of luminescent sea creatures are among the educational delights shown, all described with current scientific knowledge.
53 minutes long and narrated by Wendie Malick, with music by Marc Aramian that enhances the mood, this is a great documentary for all animal, science, and nature enthusiasts, and makes one realize how interconnected we all are, with each species having its unique and spectacular talents.",1068336000,3,1724,4.965397923875432
