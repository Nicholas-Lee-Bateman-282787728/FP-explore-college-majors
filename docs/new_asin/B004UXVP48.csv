8442370,5,B004UXVP48,"Nuremberg-the official US documentary is a classic must see record of probably the most important trials ever. This is one of the better prints I've seen of this film. It of course, shows the trials of some of the head Nazis and their systematic crimes against humanity. There is some scenes of concentration camps that are disturbing. It's just amazing footage that's well narrated. The Nazis Strike is 1 chapter from the Why We Fight Series by Frank Capra. It shows how the Nazis worked their evil magic, by softening up the opposition with so-called fifth columnists. It does give some idea of what a terrible threat to the whole world Hitler and his minions were.",1302652800,,667,4.758620689655173
