4344247,5,B004EPZ0BG,Went with a group of people who ended up loving up.  Then anyone I know who went really loved it and enjoyed it too.  This is one movie I would actually PAY to see again at the theater.  Justin and Mila had great chemistry and were both very funny.  I was surprised to see how funny Justin was but shouldn't have been he is great on Saturday Night Live.  If you are looking for a deep movie this is not it.  If you are looking for a light funny movie that could be real and that could actually happen this would be it.,1313193600,5,518,3.9805825242718447
4344248,5,B004EPZ0BG,"Most people say they won't see FWB because it is the same thing as NSA, but truthfully only the idea is the same. I have seen both movies and FWB is my favorite by far, it has more life issues in it and i feel like justin and mila have GREAT chemistry together. The movie has tons of laughs, emotional parts, and also tons of cute parts. This movie is one of my favorites and should definatly be seen whether you liked or didn't like NSA, since they are two completely different films.",1312934400,9,485,4.225806451612903
4344249,3,B004EPZ0BG,"Friends turn to each other for their basic need of sex, no strings attached.  Of course you can see it coming a mile away, they are meant for each other.  I think they cast the parts perfect, even Justin Timberlake did a good job being the bumbling guy in this movie. Granted the movie want win any awards but its a good way to spend a date night, feel good movie with a lot of laughs.",1312848000,,385,4.052631578947368
4344250,5,B004EPZ0BG,"Both Timberlake and Kunis have recently broken up with their partner. Kunis plays a recruiter for GQ magazine, and Timberlake is someone she ""stalked"" to head up their Art department. Timberlake's ex-gf is Emma Stone. What is interesting is that Kunis' character is the laid back type of person we would expect Emma Stone to play, while Stone (what little we see of her) plays an emotional character we would expect Kunis to play. I don't know if the producers did this by design, or they just lucked into it, but knowing this made the movie funny on a different level. Kunis is savvy enough to realize she has been ruined by romantic movies as she awaits her Prince to sweep her off her feet. You know at the end of the movie, come running to her as she is about to leave, and pour his heart out to her.

Kunis gives Timberlake a fast paced tour of NY, perhaps one of the best sells for Manhattan I have seen in a long time. The movie verbally condemns Hollywood's romantic comedies while ironically creating one identical to it. With some quick character build up, the film goes to a scene where Timberlake and Kunis decide that they will have sex without the emotional baggage while swearing on a Bible app.  No complications, just sex. Guess how that turns out?

Woody Harrelson plays a gay sports editor who is not shy about being gay. Woody gives Timberlake love advice, ""It's not who you want to spend Friday night with, but who you want to spend all day Saturday with.""

The sex scenes between Kunis and Timberlake are more comical than romantic. Timberlake likes to keep his socks on and sneezes after an orgasm, and Kunis is a screamer. Patricia Clarkson plays Kunis' super hip mother, who has never really told her daughter who her father was. In her first few minutes he was Greek, Puerto Rican, or Russian...she is sure he was Eurasian.

The dialogue is fast and witty. Kunis did a background check on a guy she dated.

Timberlake responds: ""Did you do a background check on me?""

Kunis:""How could you possibly max out an Old Navy card?""

Timberlake: ""I was just out of college and really into cargo pants.""

In spite of the adult themes, the movie has a lighthearted chick flick Disney quality to it. The acting was good. The movie was very clever. If you liked ""No Strings Attached"" you might find this one on par or slightly better.

F-bomb,sex, brief nudity, deals with Alzheimer's. 5 star chick flick",1312675200,109,2418,4.576388888888889
4344251,5,B004EPZ0BG,"For me, the track record of the 2011 comedy releases did not seem great, so I was a bit nervous about watching this movie. That being said, I was completely wrong and surprised by this film. Starring Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, and Woody Harrelson, ""Friends With Benefits"" is, well, exactly about what it sounds. Timberlake, upon moving to New York to take a new job, has as his only friend Kunis, who lured him to New York for the job to begin with. As the two develop as friends, so does their relationship develop. While the ending may be predictable, the storyline of the friendship, a character with Alzheimer's, and the ""realness"" of the film lend reality to comedy.

ACTING: A

Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, and Woody Harrelson all shine in this film, with Timberlake and Kunis taking charge of the lead roles and producing a sense of positive interaction and giving believability to the plot and the humor. Harrelson, as a side character (Timberlake's gay co-worker/friend), is flamboyantly gay and unafraid to show it: creating many entertaining moments in his own right.

PLOT: B+

Sure, the plot is believable. Most plots of romantic comedies are. This film, for me, was different in that it was also about Timberlake's film-dad suffering from Alzheimers, about Kunis' mommy-issues, and about the development of the characters as adults. This is far from a rote comedy along the lines of every other script, making it enjoyable!

COMEDY: A

At points, I couldn't stop laughing, particularly in the interaction in the bedroom between Kunis and Timberlake as well as due to Harrelson's character. To be sure, the humor is crude and sexual most of the time, but you could probably guess that from the title.

FINAL REVIEW: BUY IT

This film is definitely one to purchase. I will be doing so as soon as it leaves theaters. It was more than a romantic comedy, for me, just as it was more than a raunchy, sexual comedy. If you like Kunis and Timberlake, they are at the top of their games in this film. Don't hesitate to buy, but be aware that it is a very sexual movie!",1312329600,56,2079,4.723756906077348
4344252,5,B004EPZ0BG,"I not only love ""Friends with Benefits"" because Justin Timberlake is in it, but it's a funny, exciting film that deals with how friends can become intimate without the worry of getting involved in a relationship. The term ""friends with benefits"" has been used a lot in the last ten years as we see more and more people shying away from marriage and from being involved romantically with someone, so it's nice to see a film that explores this issue.

 The movie also stars Mila Kunis and co-stars a very funny Woody Harrelson who plays the gay friend of the Justin Timberlake character.

 The movie is very similar in theme to the Ashton Kutcher film ""No Strings Attached"" that was released earlier this year.

 ""Friends with Benefits"" became a certified hit at the boxoffice making nearly $19,000,000 and coming in third for the week.",1311724800,2,834,4.756944444444445
4344253,4,B004EPZ0BG,"Let's cut to the chase. This film has 3 things going for it that makes it a pretty good romantic comedy --

(1) Chemistry:  Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake interact with each other so well on-screen that at the end of the film you wonder if they ever were a couple in real-life. Their flirtations don't seem forced; their body language is in sync and they seem, at times to be oblivious to the rest of the world (or at least the cameras) in their scenes together.

(2) A Strong Supporting Cast: This movie has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to its supporting cast. Richard Jenkins is phenomenal in his role as Timberlake's on-screen dad. And it's a difficult part. He is asked to play a man who is struggling mightily with a life-altering situation but is trying to live with it with all the grace and wit that he can still muster.  Patricia Clarkson, was excellent as well as Mila Kunis's wildly inappropriate mom. (In fact, her character helps the audience understand why her daughter grew up to be such a tightly-wound, Type- A adult.) But, all of the supporting actors, Woody Harrelson was the star. Playing a sexually-aggressive sports editor, he slyly murmurs off-color lines with fantastic comedic timing but also manages to be the film's thought-provoking voice of reason.

(3) A Real Script:  At their worst, romantic comedies are mind-numbingly predictable. Many recycle the same plot, plug-in random actors and actresses and simply expect audiences to flock to the theatres. Hollywood seems to be saying ""hey, I know you have seen `50 First Dates' but we are rolling out a new version starring Luke Wilson and (whoever the `It- Girl of the Moment' is) that you must see."" While we may never be able to escape the same ol' storyline (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy eventually wins girl back by doing something both ludicrous and sweet), this film does its best to try a few new things and it deserves credit for that.

In conclusion, does this movie rival the 90s classics like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Pretty Woman"" or even Mila Kunis's prior outstanding film ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""? No.  But was it really fun to watch on a lazy summer afternoon?  Absolutely.",1311552000,3,2195,4.74015748031496
4344254,3,B004EPZ0BG,"Two attractive young adults, tired of the dating scene, decide to become friends who also engage in sex. This brings the expected complications, resulting in the predictable ""will they or won't they"" ending. This one is a mixed bag. The leads have good chemistry, and the parents of both bring a bit of depth to the story. However, the formula has certainly been done before, and nothing new is added here. Might be a good movie to take your girlfriend out to see, as it has a few laughs, and may lead to some hanky panky. Just make sure you wait until you get home.",1311465600,,566,4.4

Sex scenes were done mostly with covers, so it was done with some class.  Story is simple about a guy and a gal getting rejected by their ex-boyfriend/girlfriend.  He's a big art executive and she's a major head-hunter/executive searcher.  The two meet in New York City for an art director position for GQ Magazine, and he's from California.  They both have relationship and family issues of their own kind.  They decided to have a simple sexual relationship that does not include emotional attachments, or friends with benefits.

Without any buildup, they suddenly decide to have sex with no emotional ties because of past complications with people they dated. It just seemed surreal and the sex scenes were more like instructional videos on how to be a good lover than just a good romp in the bed. I liked the male lead but not so much the female lead.

But, had it's sentimental moments which might tug many people's heartstrings with Richard Jenkins (Fun With Dick and Jane, Stepbrothers), more dramatic roles of playing Timberlake's father with Alzheimer's. The Perfect balance of drama and comedy, but was very funny. Also, you might think Timberlake's character has a type watching the beginning-his ex, looks a lot like his, ""Friend"", Mila.

4349995,5,B004EPZ0BG,"Okay, so by no means is this movie a masterpiece. However, it's still a lot of fun to watch! Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake have some really great chemistry together.

That script is fast-paced with a lot of energy and plenty of funny moments. I was expecting a lot of tasteless sex scenes in an attempt to make the movie really sell, but the sex scenes were more comedic and while it was crude humor it wasn't completely disgusting like a lot of contemporary movies are and it was actually funny. There's a lot of great one-liners and laugh aloud moments and, of course, there's some good heartwarming moments as well.

I would definitely recommend this movie if you're looking for something entertaining to watch.",1428105600,7,717,4.728

4351432,5,B004EPZ0BG,"I've passed this movie around to all my friends. Everyone loves it.  It is a situational, young adult, love story that captured and kept us laughing from beginning to end. Contains sexual content but very little nudity.  The story line gets a bit hokey near the end, but not to the extent that it matters. It was hilarious throughout.  Didn't know that Justin T could act, but he performed believably and quite well.  However, Mila Kunis, whom I had not seen before, was absolutely in her element.  She so fit the role that it was never apparent that she was acting. She carries the show with energy and brilliance.  Anyone who doesn't like this movie is in a really bad mood.",1400371200,3,676,4.545454545454546

I love Mila...she's so down to earth and TRUE to her calling!! she's SO ORIGINAL  :-) sometimes love stories don't give true depictions of the REAL UP/DOWNS of REAL LOVE! but the truth is love hurts, it COST, it's great, it's sad, it's painful, it's BEAUTIFUL! and more! but ALLLL at the same time! it's the BEST of times at the WORST of times....sometimes!  but this was a GREAT story line...and so REAL how we both, men and women try VERY hard at putting up a guarded wall to protect ourselves in showing our TRUE HEART/FEELINGS, but when you find that SPECIAL ONE!

4351627,5,B004EPZ0BG,I love this movie because they make something that people talk about doing actually work out.  Friends with benefits is a wonderful idea that most would love to have and Hollywood gives it to us in the comedic personalities of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis.

The CSR team has their hands tied, as they have no control over the warehouse, but something needs to be fixed, or stop selling it saying it has the UVVU copy.",1396483200,,407,3.951219512195122

I really like the scene with the father in the airport . It does have a lot of bad language when it really doesn't need to, but I have learned to ignore that.

I was pleasantly surprised to be cackling and ready to watch again before the 2-day On Demand ran out. More than one of us immediately decided it was a must buy. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have great chemistry in this story and while there are some very cliche moments, it's a clever, well-delivered storyline. The actors play the roles in a way that you want to go hang out with them and there are several laugh out loud moments. While there's certainly plenty of sexual content, it's not nearly as raunchy as I had feared either, which I found to be a plus.",1393718400,,665,4.328

4352019,2,B004EPZ0BG,"I really, in hindsight, don't know why I even purchased this movie. I guess the reviews made this sound like it would be okay--a love story for a modern age. The story involves two people choosing to have a sexual partner/friend relationship without any actual love involved, and quite predictably, that doesn't last. On their journey to togetherness, these characters prove very unlikeable as they are both very crude (the really crass language throughout is very off-putting), they offer viewers little more than a constant view of their need for lots and lots of sex, and by the time they finally seem to be maturing a little (when they have to deal with issues of aging parents and actual intimacy), they have proved so unappealing (all along) that the viewer doesn't have much to root for in the relationship that is finally developing.

The dvd cover shows what looks like a cute couple, but in the end these two characters seem really shallow and damaged. I wouldn't want to know people like this and they seem like they are destined for lives of emptiness and self-destruction. Be aware that this has a lot of very, very crude language and many overt sexual acts (not always seen, but always described and viewed from above). I really wish I had the time back that I spent watching this very mediocre movie.

The only scenes worth watching involved the aging father, his daughter and grandson, and how difficult it is to have a family member with Alzheimer's. I found myself caring much more about the journey of these characters than the two main ones. It's too bad that the best story lines in this film belonged to the lesser developed characters. This is definitely one worth passing by.",1391126400,,1699,4.755932203389831

Having been to New York on many occasions and lived in the Los Angeles area, in my opinion they had the friendly factor for the people reversed.

Justin Timberlake did a good job of acting as did Mila Cunis. The story itself held no reality with it. It should have been called How to Have almost Constant Sex with Someone You're Not in Love With. Even at the end when they finally discovered that their relationship was more that just friends. I don't think the movie should have played out the way it did. I think it should have been relationship, friendship and then sex.

4352730,1,B004EPZ0BG,"I remember why I don't like these two actors. The boy band guy and annoying chick on that 70's show return. I think I just threw up in my mouth. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have landed some good roles to distance themselves from the banal and overtly commercial. They then did this movie. Keep these two apart from now on, please!

Without giving away too much, this movie has one of best and one of the worst sex scenes. The first sex scene is funny, realistic in the awkwardness and that is truly sexy. The second is smarmy, over-the-top stylized psuedo-porn. This is important because it at the end of the first sex scene that the two lovers joke about Rom-Coms and the use of too many indie songs. The second scene is just plain insulting to the audience, showing us no respect.

So what does the Director do? Overload the soundtrack with wall-to wall wishy-washy indie songs that you are now conscious of it the entire time. It is unbarable in the extreme! Any charming aspect to characters is out the window, as this movie sinks into monotony and stereotypes. The humour goes out the window, and the ending was unapologetically vapid and cliche. Another way this movie robs the characters of sympathy, is by placing them in the upper-middle to upper class. ""Oh, I've got too much money to be happy in a committed relationship"".

If you like 90 minutes of upper class twit self-pity wrapped in an unfunny Rom-Com. This is your movie, complete with awful music that you probably love. Yeah, I hate you too.",1377648000,4,1515,4.603703703703704

4353369,3,B004EPZ0BG,"A fun movie but nothing you haven't seen before.  JT is a good actor and he shows his range here and of course the uber-hot Mila Kunis is adorable as always.  Mila gets the 'flighty, too cool for school, I could leave you at any point' persona that a lot of young actresses in this types of movies get.  I would imagine it's aimed at making the character feel like she's the ultimate catch and must be pursued by our male protagonist.  Also, giving such young characters six figure salary jobs rips this from reality a bit.  Not saying that doesn't happen in reality, but it doesn't happen enough for this to be a movie for realistic people.

The best part of this movie is the relationship JT's character has with his Dad, and the best scene (in my opinion), is the one in the airport.  If you have ever known someone, or known of someone, who has suffered (or is suffering) from Alzheimer's, then this scene should hit you in the feels.

As I wrote, all-in-all, a slightly above average take on things we've seen before.  Especially the end; it was just a different twist on a cliche ending.",1364860800,2,1093,4.425

4353612,4,B004EPZ0BG,"Defintely not the most realistc dvd out there.  But it moves at a good pace and the main characters are amusing even if the female recruiter is unusually agressive in her methods and language. Not the type of lady(and I use the word loosely) that a self respecting many would date.  But maybe Justin Timberlake's character is lacking in that area as well as intimacy.

You know how the movie is going to end shortly after the beginning.  However, the little twists and turns along the way definitely make it an interesting ride.  The female recruiter's mom is especially amusing as a free spirited soul who has not truly found her soul mate.

4353722,4,B004EPZ0BG,"Romantic comedies have been done so much, and using the same, typical formulaic story that frankly, I had been wondering if there was anything left in the tank.  I like romantic comedies, but in recent years, they haven't offered much.

We all know the formula.  Boy meets girl or girl meets boy.  Usually, they click right off, or it is one of those typical ""worship"" comedies where one of them dreams of being with the other, and it takes most of the film for them to get together.  If they click right off, then they start off well until some kind of conflict arises that threatens to put the relationship in jeopardy.  Of course, in the end of either scenario, things work out.  Sometimes, great exaggeration is used in the ""working out"" process.  It's ironic how much people view romantic scenarios like a movie.  And why not?  Things always work out in the movies, right?

Two things make this film work better than your typical romantic comedy: the actors and the story.  Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are very believable in their respective roles as Dylan and Jamie.  Sure, they are both coming off of relationships that didn't work out, they meet in NYC, and before you know it, they click.  The irony here, is that neither of them is looking for anything romantic.  So, we can dispense with the typical ""wooing"" stage of the formula.  Despite the fact that we all know that they will end up together in the end doesn't matter as much because the journey is interesting.  Both are playing real people to the extent that neither is demonstrating that they are somehow better than anyone else.  In other words, they could be anyone.  Both of them know that neither one of them is perfect, and frankly, neither one is striving to be.  They come with baggage as does anyone with their relationship and personal history.

There are some aspects of the story that we can easily say, ""okay, seen it a million times already.""  However, these are two characters who are very real, and I think one of the things that endeared me to both of them is that neither one is trying at all to be someone they are not.  The only movie that I can think of where this was done so well was ""When Harry Met Sally,"" which for my money, is still the best romantic comedy done in the last 30 years.

Now, the story is interesting as it takes an idea that I am sure many people have either tried to do themselves or have wondered about.  Can two people have a sexual relationship without any kind of emotional attachment?  It is funny that the gay man in Dylan's life (wonderfully played by Woody Harrelson) and the dysfunctional mother in Jamie's life (equally impressive by Patricia Clarkson) in a sense let Dylan and Jamie know that it really isn't possible.  Of course, we know that at some point, one of the characters is going to ""fall for"" the other.  What makes the story work as that we see BOTH characters fall for each other at relatively the same time rather than one pursue the other until the other finally comes around from some kind of epic point of realization.

Dylan knows he loves Jamie, even if he doesn't say it, and it's clear that Jamie loves Dylan as well.  The conflict comes into play when both characters are trying to admit it, not only to each other, but also to themselves.  Everyone can relate, to some degree, with two characters who love each other but are afraid to say it.  Sound familiar?  This happens on practically a daily basis.  Isn't it ironic how petrified we become to say three words to someone: I love you.

Michael Landon may have expressed this  best when he said, ""You know we have a lot of funny notions born inside of us. The funniest is that we're supposed to hide the way we feel about people. Let me tell you, everybody wants to know that they are loved, or needed, or cared about. Anybody who doesn't want to know that has something wrong with them.""

Now, the challenge of a film like this is how to end it.  How to come up with a type of emotionally satisfying climax that works and also hasn't been done several hundred times already.  The climax is satisfactory.  It does work, even if it is fairly typical.  This was the only part of the film that I was hoping might be different.

So, if you are looking for another romantic comedy to watch, and you have almost given up on the entire genre, like I practically did, then you can be glad that there is at least one more that is definitely worth watching.  Timberlake and Kunis have the chemistry that really helps to make this film work.  The comedic part of the film works too as neither character is ""trying"" to be funny, but instead we find the humor in real, every-day life situations.",1360108800,,4685,4.48051948051948

4354226,3,B004EPZ0BG,"First the unrealistic parts:  1. You go to New York ( and you're a guy ) and a hot girl meets you there cause she's the recruiter :  Unrealistic.  It would either be a guy or an unattractive woman meeting you......likely a guy.  I get called by recruiters all the time and they're 20 - 30 somethings guys headhunting for commisions.  2. The hot girl is totally forward, friendly, waits all day for you to finish your interview so she can take you for a drink:  UNREALISTIC - in reality hot women are getting texts and phone calls on their cell phones 24 hours a day from all her male suitors she would already have because she's been living in that town for a while. So, tons of guys would be birdogging her and she wouldn't wait around for you ( a guy from out of town ) for any reason.  In the real world, hot women,like Mila Kunis are a commodity and highly sought after and usually already taken.  Also, in real life, men are the aggressors and women are more demure.  Men are like dogs and women are like cats....ie cats scare easy.  Men have to convince women to do things with them....get coffee or date.  In this movie, Justin t. has a don't give a $##$ attitude and is the one being pursued after by the hot girl.  Unrealistic....it's the other way around.  That's human nature.
  Justin Timberlake is so much more talented than John Mayer that he has seeming disdain for him in this movie:  UNREALISTIC - In reality John Mayer has more talent in one of his fingers than Justin T. has in his whole body.  John Mayer writes his own stuff....plays guitar like Jimmy freaking Hendrix and sings good.  Mayer's lyrics often have deep meaningful insights to life ( except for some of that obvious made for radio stuff....which I don't care for either )  Meanwhile what does TImberlake do?  Jump around on stage.....playing NO instrument....dressed in Shiny outfits and sing along to boy band songs.  Big freakin whup.  Mayer having disdain for Timberlake.....would make more sense.
  OK....there were some funny parts.....but the lack of what the real world is like in terms of human nature and the way women and men interact......blew it for me.",1355529600,,2149,4.56544502617801

Building on that factor the best strenght here is the line deliveries and overall chemistry between the two lovers, played by Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Timberlake's dancing skills are properly used enough and Kunis plays on her bubbly personality to make it work well enough. Both are good at their humor deliveries as well and let me also add that the music track is very nice to suit the mood.

For those who saw the Portman and Kusher film ""No Strings Attached"" I would say this one is a notch or two up.

Supporting roles by Jenna Elfman (as Timberlake's sister), Woody Harrelson (as the gay sports editor) and Richard Jenkins( as the mentally deteriorating father). Emma Stone is Timberlake's ex-girlfriend.

Rating: 1.5 out of 5

Jamie is an executive recruiter who recruits Dylan, a young, up and coming art director for a small internet company in Los Angeles, to come to NYC and work for the much more high powered GQ Magazine. Before this happens, there's a prologue showing their back story: both are going through another unsuccessful relationship with a member of the opposite sex. When Jamie and Dylan meet each other for the first time, they're both jaded, as they've been burned one too many times, in their quest for 'true romance'.

While getting to know each other, they watch a parody of a romcom (romantic comedy) on TV, both bemoaning the pitfalls of traditional courtships and wondering perhaps how they can circumvent all the complications associated with traditional romance. They forge an unlikely friendship where they can avoid any kind of commitment in the relationship and simply enjoy sex for its own sake. Hence, the 'benefits' is the satisfaction of having the sexual relationship without the commitment.

Soon, the film's scenarists strategy of setting us up for an old fashioned morality tale, becomes clear. The 'friends with benefits' program--that is, sex without commitment, is only part and parcel of a larger overall problem with the personalities of our protagonists. Jamie and Dylan are unfortunately narcissistic, coarse and immature.

The film's scenarists would like us to laugh at Jamie and Dylan, as they expose their foibles in the first thirty minutes or so. Jamie, the perennial go-getter, obnoxiously puts down Dylan, who extols the virtues of wide-open, west coast living as opposed to what he regards as the cramped living style of New Yorkers (the put-down becomes clear when Jamie sarcastically cracks, ""What are you, a Gazelle?).

If Jamie's coarseness is off-putting, it pales in comparison to Dylan's complete cluelessness. Dylan is so narcissistic that he simply can't understand why he's so wrong about Captain Sully. People rightly perceive that he's stubborn and ignorant when he claims 'planes fly themselves'. In reality, Captain Sully's plane was almost completely disabled due to the bird strike and could not possibly fly itself. So he's wrong on that count and 'tunes out' all those who are justifiably angry with him.

Dylan's myopic 'Sully stance' is indicative of what's wrong with the first third of the film. By trying to 'humanize' the characters, exposing them as deeply flawed human beings, the film's scenarists have gone too far and made them out to be decidedly unlikeable. Somehow the Sully joke needed to be lighter and not cast Dylan in such a negative light. That way, we would care more about him at the end, when he finally does redeem himself. The same goes for Jamie whose constant use of expletives coupled with her overreaching competitiveness, also casts her in a negative light, during the expository sequences.

The failed comedy of exposing the two 'losers' who adopt the self-defeating 'friends with benefits' program becomes a much more traditional romance in Act II and III, not unlike the 'film within a film' parody of the romcom the two lovers watch and disparage early on. It doesn't take long for Jamie to have true feelings for Dylan, after he invites her to California to meet his family and they have an intimate tryst. But Dylan remains locked in his fear of commitment and after Jamie overhears him putting her down while talking with his sister, the third act crisis is precipitated.

It takes a little while longer before Dylan redeems himself by realizing how selfish he's been, but with the aid of two key allies, he finally sees the light. The allies who counsel Dylan are of course, Tommy, his gay co-worker, delightfully played by Woody Harrelson and Dylan's Alzheimer's afflicted father, Mr. Harper (solidly and convincingly played by Richard Jenkins).

Couldn't you guess, but despite Mr. Harper's fluctuating memory loss, he manages to impart to his son, a tale of long lost love which turns out to be the big lesson here: don't let your best shot at love slip away.

It's all very predictable and sentimental but Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis do seem to exude some chemistry, working together. I only wish their characters were a little less alienating and a little more gregarious in the first thirty to forty minutes.

In the end, 'Benefits' can only live up to its billing for its romance and not its comedy. Simply put, there's nothing funny about obnoxious, clueless people. But once these protagonists are transformed, they do become a bit more likable. Still, is this rather predictable 'love-fest', a film you'll remember for a long time? I doubt it quite a bit.

As an old fashioned morality tale, where a misguided couple realizes the error of their ways and finds 'true love' in the process, 'Benefits' fits in well with the pantheon of mediocre romcoms, populating our movie theaters today.",1346371200,,4951,5.001215066828675

4354521,3,B004EPZ0BG,"If you've seen ""No Strings Attached""  you've seen this movie---the two are so parallel they're not so much like book ends, but one bookend split in two.

This one takes place in New York City, and is yet another film that makes what was not so long ago America's version of Hell look as pretty as Paris (think about it, NYC was once the setting for films like ""Taxi Driver"").  Here, both characters are on the rebound, which in most movies would have them avoiding relationships.  In this instance they decide to have a sexual relationship without entanglements.  Woody Harrelson plays a humorous gay character, and of course in many ways what the main characters are doing is having a gay relationship, since the idea of pregnancy or any other serious consequences never comes up.  A lot of historic characters had such relationships:  Don Juan comes to mind.  Baron Von Munchausen even flirted with the Queen of The Moon, and turned down the hand of Catherine The Great.  But those were love affairs of men.

It's the 21st Century, so  Hollywood has given us two young adults (four if you count ""No Strings Attached"") where the man is everything polls tell us women want, yet the woman doesn't want anything more from him than sex.  Well, of course, they fall in love by the end of the film and everything gets messed up, but what can I say?  No spoilers here.

Fast moving, at times scenic, quite contemporary (meaning that in the future it will be interesting to watch for it's depiction of our times, flash mobs and the like) and sexy without being erotic, it's no ""Sex and Lucia"", not by a long shot.  This is your rainy day movie, or something to pick you up when you haven't the energy to watch something that requires your brain.

4354524,5,B004EPZ0BG,"I never thought I would like a movie that featured Justin Timberlake sexing anyone up.  I was wrong.  This movie is phenomenal.  The director throws viewers right into the film with a whimsical dual scene in which both Timberlake and Kunis portray the rejected partners of separate relationships.  Quickly, the plot develops and it is no quickie.  Character development and relationships feel natural and genuine. This movie will definitely be a trans generational hit despite the unconventional ideas behind it.

I am impressed with Timberlake as an actor, performer, and musician.  ""What do you know about women anyway,"" is more than Dylan's impression of life.  In this film, Timberlake becomes Dylan.  I could see other actors in the role, but I doubt they could have pulled it off with the same style and memorable charisma.  Of course, his trademark sexuality also makes for a great draw for many.

Mila Kunis is incredibly sexy in this too.  She plays the independent professional woman well, but reminds me that there is a little princess deep down inside who wants her romance to be magical.  ""Why don't they ever make a movie about what happens after the kiss,"" Jamie wonders.  Kunis's Jamie also defies the stereotypical hero by being just as charismatic, controlling, and heroic as her male counterpart is.

Woody Harrelson makes a great-unexpected wise man in this too.  His skewed vision and outrageous portrayal of a metrosexual plays perfectly into the chemistry of the film.  He also contrasts Timberlake's strutting and boasting effectively.  There is definitely no overacting in his work.

I also love Jenna Elfman, and her portrayal as the wise sister and alert girlfriend is sensational.  She is genuine, charismatic, and does not upstage either Timberlake or Kunis despite her super-star skills.

I would not recommend this for anyone under 18 though.  The content is very sexy, and though it comes clean as a romantic comedy, there is just enough sultry fun to make it adults only.  I am not sure how it rates at the box office, and I am positive America's modern teens dug their teeth into this eyes-wide-open.  Despite that, there is a culture in America of sexual propriety.  Rated R movies are one of the benefits of getting older.

The soundtrack for this movie is also incredible.  Songs like Semi Sonic's Closing Time to Kriss Kross's Jump, Jump mark the action with catchy tunes that will conjure up memories of the film for anybody.",1340755200,,2464,4.960880195599022

The ending is so predictable, I could have written it myself, but this charming little rom-com is still worth watching.  Timberlake and Kunis have a nice chemistry . . . and both have nice bodies to admire during the not-infrequent sex scenes.

Sweet, sympathetic and caring towards Kunis's character. Kunis plays a Headhunter who gets Timberlake's character an Art Director job at GQ.

4354652,3,B004EPZ0BG,"The friend I was staying with this weekend, who I shall call R, encourages my worst pop culture impulses. Or perhaps I encourage hers. Either way, we decided we needed to view a double billing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Strings-Attached/dp/B004RC8NUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Strings Attached</a>&nbsp;and Friends with Benefits.

All four lead actors (Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Justin Timberlake) were charming. Portman's Emma was my favorite character. She's brilliant, driven, and the movie doesn't make her sacrifice her career for true love. Justin Timberlake's Dylan was probably my least favorite, for reasons explained later. Therefore, No Strings Attached wins the leads.

Both films have terrific supporting casts. I loved the side characters in No Strings Attached - Emma's neurotic med student roommates, Adam's friends with bad advice, coworker Lucy, and Kevin Kline as one of the worst parents ever. Then Friends with Benefits's came along with Woody Harrelson as a manly, openly gay coworker and Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father with Alzheimer's. Plus, there's tons of brilliant cameos. Friends with Benefits wins secondary characters.

Final category: story. In No Strings Attached, Emma and Adam have been casual acquaintances for years. After beginning a casual sex relationship, Adam clearly wants something more while Emma isn't ready to make an emotional commitment. While both of them come close to screwing things up, neither makes a truly awful mistake. Friends with Benefits's Dylan and Jaime become friends first, then decide to sleep together. They obviously become something more, but Dylan isn't ready to admit it - which causes him to say some very hurtful things about Jaime. She, of course, overhears them. That scene felt cliche and made me dislike Dylan, but overall Friends with Benefits was funnier, more realistic, and had a truer emotional core. Thus, Friends with Benefits wins, by a hair, the better storyline.

I slightly preferred No Strings Attached and R felt the same about Friends with Benefits. But both of us agree that if you're going to watch a 2011 romantic comedy, it should be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crazy-Stupid-Love-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy/dp/B003Y5H574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crazy, Stupid, Love (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)</a>.

4354653,4,B004EPZ0BG,"FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS  is a bit of a twist on the usual run of romantic comedies; hook-ups are for sexual gratification only with no emotional strings attached -unless.... And that is where this film starts out, with a lot of promise. The story is by Harley Peyton with assistance from Keith Merryman  and David A. Newman who with director Will Gluck adapted the story for the screenplay. Sound like a lot of cooks to spoil the broth? Well, in part it probably is as there are many little subplots here that bump into each other.

Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is a New York head-hunter trying to sign Los Angeles-based Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) for her client. When he takes the job and makes the move, they quickly become friends. Their friendship turns into a friendship with benefits, but with Jamie's emotionally damaged past and Dylan's history of being emotionally unavailable, they have to try to not fall for each other the way Hollywood romantic comedies dictate.  Add to this fairly substantial idea the gay character Tommy  Bollinger (Woody Harelson in a fine little cameo) and Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's galavanting mother and the mix becomes funny. Despite a rather intrusive copout ending there is PLENTY of eye candy from Timberlake and Kunis and lots of bed romping. It's goofy but entertaining and it does show that Justin Timberlake is becoming a fine leading man on screen.  Grady Harp, April 12",1335484800,,1420,4.895833333333333
4354782,5,B004EPZ0BG,"Yes, this is a rom-com but not your typical one. It has quick-witted snappy dialogue you can imagine you and your friends would actually say and not just a series of ""oh, aren't we clever"" one-liners. In other words, it takes place in an adult world where people have actual lives (and jobs!) and have actual conversations between all the sex.

The chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake is perfect. The story also makes sense especially when you get the full picture of their family backgrounds. The supporting cast could have been gratuitous but isn't and Woody Harrelson steals the show as a foulmouthed gay sports editor at GQ. Richard ""No Pants"" Jenkins takes another turn as one of the most underrated actors around as Timberman's Alzheimery dad. Dharma Elfman plays Justin's sis. Kunis's mom is played by the always terrific Patricia Clarkson who nails the hippy dippy mom role to a tie-dye T. Gratuitous Emma Stone is classic in her lone scene. Gratuitous Andy Samberg as well in this.

4354786,4,B004EPZ0BG,"Two New York twenty-somethings, Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis), are burned out on romance and opt to carry on a no-strings affair to avoid the pain and bother of love.

The premise of this movie is quite clever: If you don't have to make an effort to be attentive and considerate of a lover due to working toward a long-term commitment, then presumably you can have nothing but fun without any hassles. Initially this approach to their sexual relationship frees up the two protagonists (in some quite comic love scenes) to openly inform each other, in the middle of sex, what they do and don't want in bed. Since we are two generations beyond the sex revolution of the 1960's with nudity in movies for some time now casually accepted, be prepared for a lot of it in this film. Fortunately, we are spared full, frontal nudity, and both stars are in great shape, so it's not a complete ordeal sitting through endless shots of their comely backsides.

This is the first movie I've seen Justin Timberlake in. I was extremely impressed with his comic chops when he hosted Saturday Night Live, and I figured he would be ideal as a romantic comedy lead. He did not disappoint my expectation. He is charmingly vulnerable, witty, and quite attractive in this film.

I had not previously seen Mila Kunis in anything. She does an excellent job as a snarky, clever, ambitious New Yorker, and I enjoyed the way she believably revealed, over the course of the film, her character's soft, romantic underbelly.

What delighted me the most about this film is its lack of raunchy slapstick. The humor comes primarily from the witty repartee between the protagonists, which is my favorite kind of comedy. The pacing is excellent, and there are some wonderful supporting actors, including Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Jenna Elfman is Dylan's sister. Patricia Clarkson is Jamie's mother, and Woody Harrelson is a gay coworker of Dylan.

So we watched _Friends With Benefits_ last night. It's good date night material being primarily a romantic comedy. Of course you basically know what you're going to get with this sort of thing.

And really there were no great surprises. Mainly the thin plot is carried by the charisma of the two leads, who did a good job I thought of making you want to like them.

In the early stages it was a bit _edgier_ than the average romcom which was fun, but that did rather fizzle out later on. Leaving me to feel it could have been something more than it ended up being. The depictions of their frank sexual discussions early on about what they like or don't like probably rang more true than anything else in the movie.

The dialogue was snappy too. More so than your average romcom and it makes a change from the endless parades of _dumb comedy_ movies. There were even some nice pop culture digs slipped in unobtrusively.

But of course it ended up playing safe. They didn't stay as FWB. We knew they weren't going to. They felt something deeper. Etc. etc.

That's fine. I enjoy sappy happy endings for this sort of movie anyway.  But it does leave me wondering where they could have gone with it if they didn't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator.",1332028800,,1289,4.506437768240343

Unfortunately it gives me yet another reason to hate hate hate Ultraviolet.

Reasons Ultraviolet is awful:

1.  The ultraviolet code for this movie is on the wrapper that is the very first thing you throw away when you get the movie.
2.  I only found out that the code was on the wrapper by googling for it's location
3.  Obtaining the Ultraviolet digital copy can only be done by signing up for a Sony Movies account and then the linking of the Sony Movie account and the Ultraviolet Account fails with an error
4.  The Ultraviolet software (an Adobe Air program, an epic fail in itself but that's for another post) is extremely buggy and the UI has no way to redeem the movie codes you get.
5.  For those of you who don't know, Ultraviolet downloads don't work with your apple device.

Ultraviolet = Epic fail

Otherwise I love this movie.  Just wish that the movie studios would realize there's a reason Apple is winning and try to copy them not re-invent the wheel.  The wheel has been and invented.

4355474,3,B004EPZ0BG,"This movie was exactly what I expected it to be, a moderately funny RomCom with a few giggles, but of course not Oscar Worthy. I do have to say that I enjoyed the cast and writing of this movie better than its similar counterpart, No Strings Attached. (I also thought it was funny that Justin Timberlake was in this movie, yet No Strings Attached was the name of N'Syncs album...missed opportunity J.T!)

The real problem was with trying to play this movie on my computer. It started off ok (when we made the movie full screen the picture was extremely fuzzy)  then the video just stopped working, and there was nothing we could do to remedy it. My boyfriend and I ended up having to watch it on my Kindle Fire together. The picture was very clear and the playback was great on the Kindle, but I had really wanted to watch it on a bigger screen and without having to hold the device the entire time.",1326672000,,899,4.377245508982036

And they deal with some tough real life issues (not talking about sex/relationship stuff) in a poignant way, without being too depressing. There is, as expected, a lot of sex, but they dealt with those scenes in a tasteful, funny, realistic way.

4355643,2,B004EPZ0BG,"My friend was urging me to watch this movie mainly because it's meant to be funny, sexy and oh well having Mila Kunis in the female leading role should be a more than enough reason to watch this movie anyway.

The movie kicked off really good and interesting until Justin Timberlake's Character and Mila Kunis's Character became friends with benefits then it became another cliche Rom/Com. Honestly!

It's almost like Hollywood has ran out of ideas when it comes to making Romantic Comedies or Chick Flicks. It's always the same exact formula. Boy meets Girl, Boy hates/dislikes Girl, Girl hates/dislikes Boy, Boy + Girl get to spend some unwanted quality time together. Boy + Girl hook up/date whatever. Boy + Girl fight/quarrel. Boy + Girl end the relationship and then in the last 10 minutes of the movie one or the other realizes they just can't do without that person, runs back to them, declare their undying love, apologizes for being a total jerk etc.... The other forgives them and then....Booom They live happily ever after. The End !

How many times, do we need to see the same story but with different actors/leading roles ? If Hollywood can't come up with an original plot to make Romantic Comedies then it's quite simple stop making and recycling the same story line over and over again ! It just gets quite tedious.

I'm so glad I rented this film instead of wasting money watching it at the theatre. I give it two stars for the first 15 minutes of it and for Mila Kunis cause she's sexy other than that...Skip this movie entirely unless you like recycled Romantic Comedies.",1326326400,2,1589,4.705035971223022

Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are hot together and both of them have a nude scene, even if it is just their butts shown. There are many funny moments, and a few serious ones.

So what do the cloistered writers, producers and directors in N.Y. & L.A. do with their lives well, sit in little pretend manly cubicles trying to tweak another dollar out of the rom-com boxed-in consumer. What is the formula that's tweaked? Middle class white professionals that cuss a lot to bluff toughness; sex dominates their discussions; monetary self interest dominates their social consciousness; parties, bars and objects-du-jour their support system. What's tweaked? Change an actor or two but not too many; change an office/occupation but not too many; change the social scenes but not too many.

Otherwise, you will probably find it to be predictable, trite, slow-moving, and just plain silly.  Its only redeeming quality is that its overarching message focuses on the importance of starting romantic relationships as a strong friendship.

Oh, and be prepared to watch Kunis and Timberlake have sex about 500 times.  While both of these people are attractive enough, after awhile, it just gets plain tedious.",1325635200,,657,5.11214953271028

Hadn't this territory been explored previously in that cynical exercise ""No Strings Attached"" where the principals had zero chemistry?  Never fear this film is at turns witty, sexy, and funny.  The chemistry between stars Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake is not only palpable but infectuous.  They are ably supported by a terrific supporting cast that includes Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Jenna Elfman, and especially Richard Jenkins who does a terrific turn as Timberlake's father with early stage Alzheimers.  Just because a theme has been tackled before, usually poorly, doesn't mean they won't eventually get it right.",1325203200,,677,5.471153846153846

this thing going nowhere it really starts to get boring. So, Justin and Mila roll around in the sack
constantly, but it is not even interesting or sexy, it is just a total yawn. I had to turn it off at about
60 min into it, because I was falling asleep and it appeared to have no end in sight. Spend you money on something else. This was just a complete waste of time.

4356075,2,B004EPZ0BG,"Honestly, this movie was not that great at all.  The cinematography was good, but not much beyond that.  Aside from being absolutely predictable, it didn't move me in the least.  I found it hard to sympathize or root for any of the characters, which is sad because it was not as though one was opposing the other, so ideally I should have been rooting for them as a couple.  Their inexcusable immaturity and poor decisions made it difficult for me to feel bad for them.

Also, I know the little bit about Dylan's father (and mother) was supposed to be heart-wrenching and compelling, and it really was not.  I couldn't help rolling my eyes because it was obviously put in there by the writer(s) to make Dylan less 1-dimensional--so we could see where he's coming from.  Honestly, I couldn't see past the beachfront view and his job at GQ.  All I got from this movie was that (1) ""my life is not perfect"": rich, attractive people have problems too--duh and (2) sex is never just sex--even if it starts off not meaning anything, it'll always means more.  Now, I'm really being generous as far as saying that's what I got from the movie when really I should say that that's what the movie attempted to convey in more time than it really needed to.  All in all, this movie fell so very flat for me--as flat as J.T.'s acting.  Make it stop!",1324857600,,1335,4.475206611570248

My one star rating is for the ""ultraviolet"" option that apparently comes with this particular combo pack version of the movie.  I usually purchase the blu-ray/digital copy combo pack versions of new movies so that I can have a digital version for my mobile content viewers (phones, laptops, tablets etc).  The digital copy in this movie is an ""ultraviolet"" version.  Ultraviolet is a ""new"" streaming option that is now being pushed and included by some of the studios in combo packs. The idea being that the ultraviolet digital version exists as part of ""your"" cloud account on the particular studio's server. This version can then supposedly be streamed or downloaded to any of your devices at any time (if you have the right hardware and software). Merits and practicalities of streaming video content aside, because the studios are so intent on trying to establish yet another new format you cannot download a digital copy without FIRST signing up for an ultraviolet account on the studio's website. Yes, yet another group wants to know your demographic, to know your email address and to subject you to their spam.  Why would we want this??

Regardless, I went to the web site, set up an account and tried to find a way to download my movie. after 10 minutes of circular references I have given up.  this is exactly what iTunes is not.  please bring back digital copies.

I don't need another format to deal with.  I will stop buying combo packs if this is the only option that we get.

Newman, the film would feature an all-star ensemble cast starring Mila Kunis (""Black Swan"", ""That '70s Show"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""), Justin Timberlake (""In Time"", ""Bad Teacher"", ""The Social Network""), Bryan Greenberg (""Bride Wars"", ""The Perfect Score""), Jenna Elfman (""Dharma & Greg"", ""Keeping the Faith"", ""Edtv""), Woody Harrelson (""Cheers"", ""Zombieland"", ""Natural Born Killers""), Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"", ""Step Brothers"", ""Burn After Reading"") and Patricia Clarkson (""The Green Mile"", ""Shutter Island"").

The film was well-received by film critics and the $35 million film would go on to make $149 million in the box office.

VIDEO:

""Friends with Benefits"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The picture quality of the film is very good.  Shot digitally, it is obvious that the goal of cinematographer Michael Grady (""Easy A"", ""Notorious"", ""Faster"")  was to capture the beauty of New York City and Los Angeles.  These scenes are absolutely beautiful and really capture the life of the city through the details of the city and the vibrant colors.

Skin tones are natural, black levels are deep and I detected no banding, artifacts or any problems.  ""Friends with Benefits"" looks fantastic in HD!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Friends with Benefits"" is presented in English, French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish, English - Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue and musically driven as one would expect from a romantic comedy.  There are moments such as the airport scene giving more ambiance to the film but for a romantic comedy, this film sports crystal clear dialogue and bass thumping music ala Kriss Kross' ""Jump"" and Foster the Parents ""Pumped Up Kids"".

But for the most part, the lossless soundtrack works for this romantic comedy and the dialogue and music are crystal clear!

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Friends with Benefits"" comes with the following special features:

  Commentary with Writer/Director Will Gluck, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis - A fun and hilarious audio commentary with the two main stars and director Will Gluck.  Both have fun telling jokes, cussing and just having fun discussing the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to romantic comedies, especially sex comedies...sometimes the storyline features bad breakups, rebound relationships but for the most part, comedies that you can sense how things will end right from the beginning.

And while the ending for this film fit the banality of other romantic comedies, its how the two protagonists get to that final point.  And for a film title such as ""Friends with Benefits"", you expect a film to showcase quite a bit of sex.  For the most part, you get a lot of good scenes with both Timberlake and Kunis in bed (note: Justin Timberlake does do his first rear nude scene while Kunis used a body double) and experimenting with each other and having fun!  But fortunately, this is not the dominating factor of the film.

The film focuses on their emotional attachment to each other, knowing that they have feelings for each other but they are so scared about how their relationships have ended in the past, that being ""friends with benefits"" would alleviate them from having any emotional attachment.  And instead of rushing into those emotions that the two have with each other, we see the journey as the two try to have flings with other people and then of course, when Jamie (Kunis) goes to Los Angeles to meet with his family, things happen that separates the two.

And the chemistry between both Timberlake and Kunis was very well done!  In fact, I found the two much more believable onscreen than Timberlake had with Cameron Diaz on ""Bad Teacher"".  The two looked right for each other and I was quite pleased to see how Timberlake has evolved as an actor and the same for actress Mila Kunis.  Both did a wonderful job!

And the supporting cast were also just as good, especially Patricia Clarkson as Lorna, the mother of Jamie but also a woman who has had a problematic sexual past.  Woody Harrelson as the gay co-worker named Tommy who is constantly asking Dylan if he is really gay, Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father who has alzheimer's and has a habit of pulling down his trousers and Jenna Elfman as Dylan's sister Annie.  Even the short appearances by Jason Segel and Rashida Jones (who star on a cheesy Hollywood romance story), as well as Andy Samberg and Emma Stone were fun to watch!

But one thing I love about romantic films is when they can capture the city the characters talk so much about.  If you talk about New York City, I want to see New York City as much as they can show on the film.  The same with Los Angeles and the film manages to showcase both cities quite well. I also liked how the film's storyline took a jab at the usual Hollywood romantic comedy and showing that although Hollywood romantic comedies tend to have the fairytale story, not all are realistic and ""Friends with Benefits"" is a film that tries to keep things real!  I dig that!

As for the Blu-ray release, there are two available on release date.  One with a DVD and Ultraviolet copy and the regular Blu-ray release with no DVD and UV copy.  The special features were entertaining especially the audio commentary which was hilarious as well as the included outtakes.  Also, it was interesting to learn about the challenges of shooting in NYC and Los Angeles and also choreographing the flash mob scenes.  The picture quality was vibrant and the on-location scenery shots of NYC and LA were awesome and audio quality was appropriate for this film.

Overall, ""Friends with Benefits"" is a charming, sexy and fun romantic comedy featuring a wonderful performance by Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a romantic comedy capturing both the beauty of love in New York City and Los Angeles by keeping things real!

Predictable it was, if by that you mean how it ends, but I enjoyed every minute of it. All characters are endearing and the sense of humor, just the kind I like. I could also relate to the story personally as it reminded me of the kind of friendship I have with my husband -OK, we are not THAT good looking, but still :)

It was sweet and funny. I just find it interesting that both Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman were in movies that dealt with the same storyline and they were both in Black Swan together. Maybe the writers in hollywood should start thinking of different stories and not recycle the same thing. (Example: Chasing Liberty and First Daughter)

I liked No Strings Attached more than i liked this movie, but i will probably watch this movie again",1323475200,,599,4.537037037037037
4356303,3,B004EPZ0BG,"Some fuss was made earlier this year when the two stars of Darren Aronofsky's acclaimed Black Swan separately appeared in two films with identical themes and equally obvious titles: first, Natalie Portman starred in No Strings Attached, and a few months later, Mila Kunis starred in Friends with Benefits. Both explored the inevitable complications that arise in sex-only relationships, but while the former was not very good, Friends with Benefits impressed me to the tune of 3 stars. Here, Kunis plays a corporate headhunter who recruits a hotshot art director from California for a job at GQ magazine in New York. The two immediately hit it off and agree to engage in a no-strings-attached relationship of pure sex until they begin to realize they're both falling for each other. So what made this film so much better than the Natalie Portman flick? The chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake is natural and immensely effective, almost carrying the movie by itself. You won't find anything new to the rom-com formula here, but it sort of works anyway.",1323475200,,1054,5.0285714285714285
4356304,5,B004EPZ0BG,"I thought this would be a chick flick but I watched it with my wife to be nice. I loved it! It is a sexy and funny story with a life lesson from dad included. The lead actress, Mila Kunis, is a cute doll and plays the role to perfection. Justin Timberlake does his usual great job playing the funny guy. It is like one of his Saturday Night Live skits but it is the length of a movie.

This is a really good movie and a good love story about finding the right one. Did I say funny? I laughed throughout the entire movie. It even has touching moments regarding family love and caring for an elder father. Watch it, you will enjoy it!",1323475200,,632,4.056
4356305,2,B004EPZ0BG,"Disease is in, poverty's out!  Yes, the United States is in worse shape than at any time since the Great Depression but you wouldn't know that viewing the film FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS even though it takes place in Manhattan, where you're either dirt poor or filthy rich, and if it's dirt poor you'd better stay out of the filthy rich's way.  But as the filmmakers don't want you to think they are out of touch with life, they toss in Alzheimer's disease, which affects one of the main character's fathers, who sadly is forgetting the beachfront property he owns.

Sure, in FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS these friends have benefits alright, more than you can say for the millions of Americans out of work or having jobs paying so poorly that health insurance deductions eat up a third of their pay.  In fact, so good are those benefits for the people in this movie, they don't even have to see anyone out of work or in one of those crappy jobs.  No wonder the young couple in FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS has all the time in the world to think about getting laid.

The one interesting aspect of FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, portrayed by Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.  Credit the actors for playing it in such a way that you can believe they might never have thought twice about one another if one had something better to do, or, should I say, someone better to do. Not that I was on the edge of my seat, wondering if they'd get together.",1323302400,,1470,4.48314606741573

Of course u know what's going to happen at the end but remarkably, this intelligently written film makes the entire journey worthwhile enough to buy the DVD. Great look at my old hometown NYC. Timberlake continues to convince he's a serious actor, Kunis is always delightful and the viewer gets an eyeful of Mila's body-double with a small and shapely behind.

I thought the inclusion of Timberlake's character's father as suffering form the onset of Alzeimers laudable, and Justin doesn't overplay the part emotionally, which was a relief in a Hollywood thats normally eager to let sobs and tears act as the panacea for dealing with all life's emotional issues.
I felt Woody Harrelson's character - not his acting - was annoying in that it's becoming so de rigeur for Hollywood to pat-on-the-back every man obsessed with other men's genitals. This MUST BE APPLAUDED BY US ALL, or you are a primitive, horrible person (whose name will soon be on some government list, no doubt) with no understanding of our human diversity. Harrelson's character dutifully fulfills his self-acceptance as a gay man obsessed with the male penis, by continuing to let everyone know he is not ashamed of it, as we - the audience - are culturally trained to accept and applaud.",1323216000,,1327,5.004524886877828

It has two great actors in lead roles, and not just that, but the diologue is so punchy, funny, and well-done, it leaves you craving more. Is the plot itself semi-predictable? Sure. But the scenery, acting, and words make up for it. It has a level of reality that few films on this topic have. Also, it is obscene without pushing the envelope (cursing, brief nudity), but the focus on the film is on two people figuring themselves (and family drama) out.

4356497,4,B004EPZ0BG,"Friends with Benefits is the second romantic-comedy of 2011 to cover the topic of the title and is directed and co-written by Will Gluck, whose previous film Easy A was a charming and genuinely funny high-school movie that pushed Emma Stone into the big leagues overnight. Debuting in theatres only six months after the Ivan Reitman's No Strings Attached, both movies deal with the subject of young characters wanting to enjoy a sexual relationship without any emotional attachment or commitment. Comparing and contrasting the two are inevitable. There's no denying that both films are similar and coincidentally the female leads in the separate films are played by Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, co-stars in last year's Black Swan. The similarities are a forgivable transgression since every rom-com that comes out of Hollywood is essentially cut from the same cloth anyway. So, in case the plot isn't completely obvious from the title, here's the synopsis:

In Los Angeles, Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is dumped by his girlfriend (a brief appearance by Emma Stone) because he's ""emotionally unavailable."" In New York, Jamie (Mila Kunis) is dumped by her boyfriend (Andy Samberg) because she's ""emotionally damaged."" Soon after, Dylan is on a flight to New York where Jamie, an Executive Recruiter, has secured a job interview for him at GQ. Dylan accepts the job and quickly becomes friends with Jamie. One night the two launch into a diatribe about how sex is necessary but seemingly impossible without emotional involvement. The two come to a mutual conclusion and make a deal; they will have sex with each other with no commitment, just as friends. You can imagine where the story goes from here. The film boasts an impressive cast that includes Woody Harrelson as Tommy, a gay sports editor for GQ as well as Richard Jenkins, Patricia Clarkson, and Jenna Elfman. There are also cameo appearances by Jason Segel, Rashida Jones, and Shaun White.

Being released in such close proximity with each other, comparisons between this and No Strings Attached are inevitable. Having seen both movies, I give this one the upper hand. Neither makes any profound statements about relationships or sex, neither are great movies, but Friends with Benefits has more going for it than No Strings Attached, beginning with the chemistry between the two leads. Timberlake and Kunis have far more convincing and striking chemistry than Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher possibly due to Gluck working with Timberlake and Kunis to help shape the characters and the script. Putting more work into this kind of film than necessary, this effort does not go unnoticed onscreen. Romantic comedies live and die by the chemistry shared by the two leads and Timberlake and Kunis have chemistry in spades. They are effortlessly charming with one another and skillfully play off each other's comedic strengths. I was immensely impressed by Timberlake's performance in The Social Network, but found myself underwhelmed by his awkward performance in Bad Teacher. He redeems himself here with his boyish charm and wit. It's easy to accept him as the successful, sensitive young man he portrays.

Harrelson's flamboyant and plain-spoken gay character provides some laughs, but the joke is dragged out longer than necessary. Clarkson, a tremendous actress, brings a quirky sense of humor to her part, although the personality of her character isn't too far separated from her character in Easy A. I'd guess that the character was adjusted to suit her simply because Gluck enjoyed working with her previously. Clarkson and Harrelson do not elevate the material, but they do make it a little livelier.

Friends with Benefits doesn't push the romantic comedy genre too far from its comfort zone. The studio allowed it to be rated R and, with this subject matter, I respect the decision to not cop out with a PG-13. Even with the rating, the sex talk is much more graphic than the sex actually portrayed onscreen. If you take any PG-13 Hollywood romantic comedy and add some dry humping, you'll end up with Friends with Benefits. If Gluck really wanted people to differentiate between his film and Reitman's, he could've been a little more fearless in what he chose to show. The most maddening thing about the movie is that characters openly discuss how every romantic-comedy is the same, following the same meet, fall in love, break up, and get back together pattern. They even discuss the way these films use obnoxiously obvious musical cues to illustrate the tone of a particular scene. Despite how self-aware this movie seems to be, it ends up doing the same thing by following the exact same template. Granted, Friends with Benefits does try to get a bit more serious by introducing a dramatic subplot about Dylan's father (Jenkins) suffering from Alzheimer's and with an actor as capable as Jenkins this subplot is more effective than it should be, but it neither adds to the film nor takes away from it. The dramatic, medical disorder angle worked much better in Love and Other Drugs.

It's totally generic, but has enough charm and wit to keep your attention. There are so many movies like this released each year and such light, forgettable fluff can never be criticized too harshly. I admit to having a soft spot for even the most forgettable romantic comedies, so please read my words with caution. Friends with Benefits is neither a great romantic comedy nor a particularly memorable one, but the charisma of the two leads and the existence of real talent in front of and behind the camera make it worth watching to some degree. It's sappy, clichd, and far from surprising but it put a big, stupid smile on my face and I couldn't have asked a movie like this for anything more.

GRADE: B",1322524800,,5763,4.991675338189386
4356498,5,B004EPZ0BG,"FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a totally predictable, albeit totally delightful, romantic comedy that succeeds thanks to a witty script, spry direction and a very likable cast.

Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are ""best friends"" who each have had difficulty with past romantic relationships and want to avoid emotional pain in the future.  Both, however, have their sexual needs, so they agree to become ""friends with benefits""; sex partners without any emotional commitment.  How this relationship is going to end up is obvious from the start, but the fun is in getting there.

The supporting players in this film certainly contribute to make it special.  Patricia Clarkson plays Mila's wandering mother, a fugitive from the 1970s who has not changed her ways and is unsure as to which of her myriad lovers fathered her daughter.  Richard Jenkins is Justin's father, suffering from Alzheimer's, and Woody Harrelson is Timbelake's openly gay co-worker.  Also in the cast is Emma Stone, Andy Samberg and Jenna Elfman.

Director Will Gluck co-wrote the screenplay with Keith Merryman and David A. Newman, who along with Harley Peyton, developed the story.

Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment  audio commentary with Gluck, Timberland and Kunis, deleted  scenes and outtakes.

FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a terrific date movie.

4356499,4,B004EPZ0BG,"""Friends with Benefits"", not only was funny, but the two leads, Justin and Mila, actually had chemistry on screen. They made it believable the connection and more. It was kind of like a modern version of ""When Harry Met Sally"", in how the characters first met and interacted the first 24hrs together. Another movie with a similar name, staring Ashton and Natalie, felt forced in their acting. Natalie was so monotone in her voice, that I thought she could take Ben Steins role from ""Ferris Bueller"" with how well she didn't change the tone in her voice throughout the movie. I mean she acted BETTER in the movie ""Thor"" than in ""No Strings Attached"".

Anyway, my point is that ""Friends with Benefits"", was a very mature RomCom that really kept true to some realistic situations that most 20-somethings encounter. Where as ""No Strings Attached"" was like a low budget porn flick with really horrible ""funny"" verbal conversing between ALL the characters (they added all the funny scenes in the trailers/tv, so there was nothing funny to laugh at because everyone had seen the scenes over twenty times from the promotions they kept doing for months).

I loved the scenes of Mila's character and her mother interacting, especially when she walks in on them banging and then is all ""It's like the 70's, heeyyyy... it's all good"", lol stuff like that is funny. But there were moments with some of the other characters that made this movie watchable. Also both Justin and Mila were very animated with their scenes, especially their faces, which made it even more funny to watch them together. Something that can't be found from the two leads in ""No Strings Attached""; wish the director told them to use their faces more to express what their characters were feeling, even if it was horny feelings, it would have sold the idea of liking the movie better.

I had to turn off ""No Strings Attached"", 40 minutes into the movie as well, which says a lot about the movie's storyline. I kept waiting for the tone of the actors voices to change and for the storyline to have something other than naked butts and grunts floating around on screen. At least in ""Friends with Benefits"", when there was naked'ness going on, they made it FUNNY! Even Justin had a scene on the toilet, naked and make it hilarious! (His role in ""Bad Teacher"" was way worse than any role he has ever had in acting, I feel so bad for that guy!).

4356500,3,B004EPZ0BG,"Not to be confused with NO STRINGS ATTACHED, a superficially similar but vast inferior film, this sexy, feel good movie again plays with the notion that good friends having sex can lead to complications and - love.  This is a movie of the moment set in the real world we all know and share.  When the movies steps aside from boy-meets-girl clichs, it deals with real human feelings, fears and emotions -- just slightly over- the-top (hey, it's a movie!).  Justin Timberlake and the immensely photogenic Mila Kunis find the right notes for this flirtatious and perhaps cautionary tale that reminds us that what we think we want is not always what we really need.  There was a change in tone with Richard Jenkin's alzheimer character and Woody Harrelson's annoyingly intrusive gay guy.  Both characters felt forced.

When Dylan (Timberlake) is lured to New York for a job by Jamie (Kunis) they become friends.  After a night of romantic comedy watching they begin to talk about how ""broken"" they are.  After a deal is worked out they become ""Friends With Benefits"", but, predictably, that only makes things worse.  The plot to this is almost the same as ""No Strings Attached"".  After having seen that one, I didn't think this one was as good.  Most of it probebly has to do with the fact that I think Portman is hotter then Kunis though.  Also No Strings felt less girlie to me, and I can't explain why.  While Timberlake was pretty funny, and Woody Harrelson had some funny lines (but did tend to go over the top) the movie really seemed to drag for me.  I did like the fact that the movie tried to make fun of all other romantic comedies (from dialog, to settings, to music) but I still got bored in parts.  I think that, like me, when compared to ""No Strings Attached"" you will pick a favorite based on the main actors.  That is because it basically the same movie.  Much like ""Deep Impact"" & ""Armageddon"".  Overall, a funny movie that is not as good as the ""original"".  I give it a B.

The movie that you are looking at is one of the first to use the new ""Ultra Violet"" system for digital copy and distribution. A lot of you may not have heard anything about it and  asking what is Ultra Violet.  The hype around Ultra Violet says that it will allow you to stream your digital copy to any device and the files are store in the cloud so that once you purchase a single digital copy you won't ever need to replace it when technology changes.  The reality is that the system is being forced on consumers before it is ready as of the release of Green Lantern and Horrible bosses (first 2 movies to use the system in mid October) exactly 0 mobile devices or set top boxes support the system and few will in the near future. Another major issue with the new digital distribution is the streaming aspect if you have a smart phone or tablet device on a limited data package is you stream a single 2 hour movie in HD the amount of data transferred could easily put you over the common 2 GB data packages.",1318723200,10,1099,4.219047619047619
4356506,4,B004EPZ0BG,"This is the second movie of 2011 involving 2 beautiful people agreeing to be sex buddies without any emotional entanglements.  Ashton Kushner and Natalie Portman did a decent job in ""No Strings Attached"" back in January.  This time we have Portman's ""Black Swan"" partner Mila Kunis pairing up with all around superstar Justin Timberlake.  Keep in mind, the movie is a no-brainer in every sense of the word.  We know where it's going by just watching the trailers, let alone getting into the movie.  Both characters of course has a confidant.  In Dylan's (Timberlake) case it's gay sportswriter Tommy played by Woody Harrelson.  For Jamie (Kunis), it's her former hippie mother played by Patricia Clarkson.  What makes this movie different from standard romcom fare is some excellent writing, snappy and funny dialog and generally good acting all around.  The film even makes fun of itself by not so subtlety criticizing others in the genre.  What really makes the film click are Timberlake and Kunis.  They are terrific together, especially in the sack where they take some pretty explicit behavior to a hilarious end.",1318464000,2,1118,5.054644808743169
4356627,3,B004EPZ0BG,"Mila Kunis is Jamie, a young New York headhunter. Justin Timberlake is Dylan, an art director living in LA. When Jamie recruits Dylan for the job of ""GQ"" magazine, they agree to start a relationship which is strictly ""physical."" Having just broken up with a boyfriend/girlfriend, Jamie and Dylan think everything will be fine - a relationship without complications and emotional baggage. Of course, it works ... for a while.

Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake (if not the characters they play) are so likable and charming that you almost forget ""Friends with Benefits"" (directed by Will Gluck, ""Easy A"") eventually becomes what it is mocking, a formulaic romantic Hollywood comedy. Without their spirited performances the raunchy rom-com would have been a mess. While we all know where the film's story is going, we are ready to accept it, clichs and all.

Supporting actors include Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson and Richard Jenkins. They all turn in solid acting jobs, and cameos from Masi Oka, Andy Samberg, Emma Stone and Shaun White (as himself) may add a few laughs, but it is the beautifully shot locations of New York City and Los Angeles that are really attractive.

Thank to the two leads, ""Friends with Benefits"" is a better than average romantic comedy, which is an old-fashioned love story at heart with a few modern twists.

Not to be confused with TV series ""Friends with Benefits.""

4356630,4,B004EPZ0BG,"A lot of time a lack of chemistry between the main characters in a romcom will leave a movie down, they just aren't believable in their roles and can seem wooden and stiff, however Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis change this trend as it's their on screen chemistry that makes this movie what it is, very enjoyable.

The main synopsis of the movie is that both Timberlake and Kunis are unlucky in love and Timberlake moves from L.A to New York where Kunis lands him a job at GQ, the two quickly become good friends. The movie is fast paced and both Kunis and Timberlake are perfect for their roles, there is plenty of laughs a long the way and features a strong supporting cast. Woody Harrelson is Hilarious in his role as Tommy, the head sports writer for GQ who happens to be gay and is convinced that Timberlake is also gay. Patricia Clarkson plays Kunis hippy loving mother who can't recall what nationality Kunis dad is. Richard Jenkins plays Timberlake's dad who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Emma Stone(who could probably have done a good job playing Kunis role if chosen) has a very small role as Timberlakes girlfriend who happens to be obsessed with John Mayer!

While the movie never strays too far from the usual romcom rules it is a funny movie that is well held together by it's lead characters.",1316736000,4,1313,4.6068376068376065

1. Boy and girl meet
2. Boy and girl swear on Bible App. to get physical without strings attached
3. Boy and girl get physical, physical
4. It gets complicated.

A rom-com with a difference, which is that you can probably get a guy to go see this with you without a complaint.  Though Mila Kunis probably has a lot to do with this, the R rating certainly helps a lot.

Kunis shines as a New York recruiter for a job agency, who convinces Timberlake's character to move from LA to take up a job with GQ.  Both of them have emotional attachment issues, but as there is a strong attraction, they agree to embark on a physical attachment without the emotional baggage.

We all know this isn't going to work, and although the ending is clearly, pellucidly obvious, just getting there is a lot of fun.  Undeniable chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis, as well as the inspired casting of Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jennings make for a deliciously decadent movie night.

4356632,5,B004EPZ0BG,"The story follows Dylan, an artistic web designer turned GQ artistic director by Jamie, a NY head hunter, as he moves to NY and they form a friendship...and then some.  The first few minutes gave the writers a chance to prove that you weren't wasting your time with this movie.  We are monsooned by a clever mix of classic and rather risqu anecdotal break-up quips as both Dylan (the ever-charming Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (the saucy Mila Kunis) both find themselves single again via synchronous break-ups.  They both make the same claim: that they'll essentially be sexually aloof and just enjoy themselves.

 For some reason the movie depicts LA folks like they're from some kind of cow town--extra cautious about crossing the street, mild-mannered, socially nave, non-confrontational and claustrophobic in the skyscraper-rich concrete jungle.  Likewise, New Yorkers come off as more in-your-face and edgy.  I really think of LA as sort of a drier NY with a tan, but otherwise city folks are city folks.  Despite the constant flinging of pro-NY propaganda both actors are their naturally charismatic, audience-pleasing selves.

 The first (sex) scene that lives up to the movie's title is a hilariously endearing and very chatty session which seems like a rehearsal before filming a how-to instructional video on sex.  Great moments of this movie include a sex scene montage with a lot of well-placed and relatable dialogue, Woody Harrelson thinking JT is gay, every single Shaun White cameo scene, JT rapping and busting out some old school Criss Cross, and Woody Harrelson choosing Shaun White over Barrack Obama for a GQ cover.  Yup, that's what America has been reduced to.

 With small roles, the brilliantly cast Jenna Elfman (Dharma & Greg), Nolan Gould (TV's Modern Family), and Richard Jenkins (HBO's Six Feet Under, Burn After Reading) are the sister, nephew and father you want to bring a girl home to meet.  All actors do a perfect job of showing us that they see what Dylan and Jamie don't.  It reminds me of my own friends waving their hands at me saying ""it's nothing serious"" or ""we're just friends"" and then getting a wedding invitation a year later.  It's so cute when they don't see it yet, isn't it?

Kunis and Timberlake's on screen chemistry is so strong that it just made me feel good whenever they were interacting with one another.  The movie gets tactfully real a bit towards the end, but it should come as no spoiler alert that you feel all warm and fuzzy at the end.

4356635,5,B004EPZ0BG,"This has been a magical summer for movies. A lot of movies that I was really looking forward to, have turned out to be lousy. However, I've seen a lot of movies that I expected to be awful, but ended up being really good. Thus, ""Friends With Benefits"". Romantic comedies are always awful for me. I love them, but they make me feel like crap. The reason why this is, is because most of them are dishonest, and make you feel like only in the movies, things work out in love. ""Friends With Benefits"" is refreshingly honest, kind of sad, yet hopelessly optimistic. Its dialogue is fast and quick, kind of ""Juno""-esque.

Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake are both coming off Oscar roles. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good in ""The Social Network"", as was Kunis in ""Black Swan"". Maybe it was a fluke that both of them were so good in those movies, but this is the kind of movie they belong in. Their characters, Dylan and Jamie, have personalities, and characteristics that mesh with each other in a really awesome way, which doesn't come very often in romantic comedies.

The story, as for most romantic comedies, isn't surprising at all. It's two people who are coming out of bad relationships, who meet in a classic cute romantic comedy way, and decide that relationships don't work out, and to remain ""friends with benefits"", or friends who (constantly) have sex. As you could imagine, this doesn't work out the way they had hoped. There was a similar movie released this January, with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher called ""No Strings Attached"", which, clearly will be referenced in most, if not all reviews for ""Friends With Benefits"". I, admittedly, didn't hate that movie. But it's a piece of dreck compared to this one.

It's a typical hour-and-forty-five minute romantic comedy. However, it's kind of this generation's ""When Harry Met Sally"". It's ""When Dylan Met Jamie"". The two leads are so great with each other, one the yin to the other's yang. You can tell that they would be conceivable as a real couple. They aren't the perfect, immediately compatible couple that usually headlines a movie such as this. Justin Timberlake keeps proving that he's a better actor than a lot of pop stars. He's insanely likable in this movie. Mila Kunis had a smaller, haunting kind of role in ""Black Swan"", where I thought she was above average. She's really allowed to shine in this one, bringing life to a character that could have been much less. The attitude of this movie is sometimes gritty, always quick, witty, and urban. It makes good use of the time it's given. It acknowledges the ridiculous romantic comedies that it could have been. Jamie and her friend, at one point, walk by a poster for Katherine Heigl's ""The Ugly Truth"", and says ""Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!"". A fake in-movie-movie, with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel, is meant to emphasize how ridiculous most romantic comedies are. Great stuff.

Another thing this one has that ""No Strings Attached"" didn't have is a great supporting cast. Patricia Clarkson plays Jamie's mother, a hippie lush who is really damn funny. Woody Harrelson also does a good job as Dylan's unapologetically bold and hilarious gay boss. He gets kudos for not making a gay character a stereotype. Richard Jenkins plays Dylan's Alzheimer's stricken father, and Jenna Elfman plays his sister. They add to the quick and zippy feel of the movie. Cameos by Emma Stone and Andy Samberg are always welcome, too.

While some probably won't like this one as much as I did, I liked all of its characters. I felt like each character was well-developed and interesting. The quick writing is what makes it better than a lot of similar movies, but when everything in it is mashed together, the whole package is very good. I look forward to watching it again.

4356636,5,B004EPZ0BG,"""Friends with Benefits"" has a lightning fast, very smart script, it moves like a limousine, and it features another stunningly moving character turn by Richard Jenkins. It's good enough that it revives hope for that troubled genre, the Romantic Comedy. It's worth seeing, more than once.

""Friends with Benefits"" surprised me. I don't understand why Justin Timberlake is famous - what is remarkable about him, really? - and Mila Kunis does nothing for me. We live in the age of decline of the Romantic Comedy. ""Friends with Benefits"" was not the forgettable, rote, mass-produced studio product I expected. It was actually really good.

""Friends with Benefits"" began really fast, and I found myself bobbing along on the script's energy. I noticed how much I was enjoying it and I kept waiting for the film to drop the ball, to let me down, to betray itself, to fall into predictable clichd traps. That didn't happen for quite a while, and the film's failings were slow in coming, minor, and didn't ruin the film.

What ""Friends with Benefits"" does right it does very, very right. The script is amazing. There are jokes that you'd need some literacy and maturity to understand. They fly right by, no pause for the viewer to laugh, or to google the references, before the next one-liner or trenchant observation rolls down the chute. Our culture has been so dumbed down that hearing a joke that one would have to have some knowledge of history or culture or even just the front page of the newspaper to understand amazed and gratified me.

The movie's strong point is that it is so fast; that's also a bit of a weak point. Legendary director Frank Capra said that ""sometimes your story has to stop and you just let your audience look at your people. You want your audience to like them...these scenes are quite important to a film. When the audience rests and they look at the people, they begin to smile."" ""Friends with Benefits"" is so frenetic, it never creates a memorable screen moment where Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) do nothing but look movie-star lovely and get under our skin.

Richard Jenkins works some powerful mojo. He's a character actor, older, bland-looking and bald, but in every movie I've seen him in lately, especially so in ""Eat Pray Love,"" he seems to be visiting from a different, better movie, and I want, after the movie I'm watching is over, to watch the superior film from which Jenkins has visited. In ""Friends with Benefits"" Jenkins plays Dylan's father who is suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's. He is funny, profound, arresting and truly lovable. What is Jenkins doing? Whatever it is, more actors should do it.

Jenna Elfman, Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Nolan Gould and Masi Oka are all very, very good in supporting roles. Clarkson, as Jamie's mother, delivers a liner about Jamie's father that made me laugh out loud.

On the surface, ""Friends with Benefits"" looks like too many other, lesser movies. It's not. It's a really good, worthwhile film.",1313539200,57,3014,4.840776699029126

8427461,3,B004EPZ0BG,"I personally enjoyed this movie a lot. Justin might not be Oscar material, but he's very charismatic on the screen and plays a likeable characters with very funny one liners. He definitely doesn't shy away from making fun of stereotypical bad rom-com movies and it shows. I also love watching Mila Kunis films, so when you add both of them together in a setting where they decide to do random hookups but trying to remain as best friends, I had high expectations for this film.

The first portion of the movie is great. Both of them live on the meat market fast lane of downtown Manhattan and are constantly being dumped by romantic partners over petty issues. Fed up of the annoyance of dating and with a tad too many beers, they decide to start to sleep with each other whenever they are in the mood, no strings attached. Truth to say, the movie begins on a hilarious note.

The issue begins when it has to take the formulaic serious section of the film where Mila starts to harbor feelings for her friend but he doesn't. The script just isn't strong enough for a serious drama fest and instead of being compelling, the movie becomes very slow and tedious and never fully recovers. I also had a huge issue when we discover Justin's father in the film suffers from Alzheimers and Mila feels shocked. It seems really out of place that he'd leave a life-long friend out of the blue of this type of devastating news. Especially since he seems to be rather emotionally close to his parents even though they live in the other side of the country.

If you ignore the faults of the movie, it's still rather fun. However, I still feel sad that they opted for the abuse of drama halfway into the movie. They could have made it more lighthearted and faster and then the movie would have earned being a cult classic of the genre.",1525478400,,1819,4.4894259818731115
