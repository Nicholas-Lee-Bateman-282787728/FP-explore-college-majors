5837592,5,B00DNLZS32,"Great copy or original movies. We haven't watched them all but the ""The Night They Saved Christmas"" was as good as the original VHS copy we have.  I expect the others are equally as good.  Not HD, of course, but very enjoyable.  The 1984 Night They Saved Christmas is my wife's favorite Christmas movie.",1384214400,11,303,4.574074074074074

5837619,4,B00DNLZS32,"I have been searching high and low for The Night They Saved Christmas! My sister and I watched a VHS recording of that movie when we were young and loved it, so when I finally found it on this combo pack I swooped it up.",1401235200,,220,3.911111111111111
5837620,2,B00DNLZS32,"Like many, I bought this for The Night They Saved Christmas, which has not been easy to get on DVD. Quite frankly the quality is just too low to bear. I had a VHS tape which I recorded onto my computer, and that VHS to digital transfer is better than the quality of the DVD in this collection. This movie isn't popular enough to expect any kind of restoration, but they actually made it worse: They stretched out the image to make it look widescreen. It would have looked better with black bars on the side. There doesn't seem to be much choice in getting this film so you may have no choice, but set yourself up for disappointment. It's probably more about bringing back the nostalgia than anything else so maybe a really low quality picture doesn't matter much. It's probably better than a TV recording made in the 90s. As for the other movies I haven't seen them, Santa With Muscles at least looks like it may be a laugh, but not for the reasons it was supposed to.",1397088000,6,968,4.3535911602209945
5837621,5,B00DNLZS32,"I particulary bought this DVD as it had the movie ""The night they saved Christmas"" with Jaclyn Smith. It is a great family movie and was glad to finally see it on DVD.
