8748503,3,B01AU89A4S,"The Great Hypnotist is a supernatural mystery thriller from China. Dr. Xu Ruining (Xu Zheng, who also directs) is a nationally renowned therapist skilled in hypnotherapy whose new patient, Ren Xiaoyan (Karen Mok), brings him a difficult problem. In this particular case, the struggle between doctor and patient isn't as easy as Dr. Xu expected. Despite her thin, weak appearance, Ren Xiaoyan always reacts violently and unexpectedly in sessions with the doctor. He wonders what exactly makes her so belligerent and closed off from everyone.

Written by Leste Chen, The Great Hypnotist is a lush-looking picture reflecting its $8 million budget. A prologue channels familiar elements from Asian horror flicks and establishes a creepy atmosphere. These scenes illustrate methods Dr. Xu has developed for treating patients with guilt complexes, and an early anecdote about child trafficking suggests that people are not always who they seem.

Director Xu Zheng creates and sustains suspense as a hypnotized Ren Xiaoyan reveals her back story. Creative photography and effective special effects enhance the mood.

There are elements of Frankenstein, as when the doctors arrogance in curing his patients whatever the method creates friction with his former mentor. But its the one-on-one relationship between doctor and patient that drives the story. Its fascinating to see how control becomes essential to both participants in therapy sessions, as each of them attempts to gain the upper hand. Much of the information that comes out in therapy is false, resulting in a series of red herrings that complicate figuring out what makes Ren Xiaoyan tick.

Though The Great Hypnotist is reminiscent of other movies, particularly The Sixth Sense and any number of films noir and cautionary tales in which doctors/scientists dare to experiment in forbidden areas, it is an above-average thriller.

The film is in Mandarin, with subtitles available in English and Chinese. There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen DVD.",1459641600,2,2018,5.393650793650794
