7908435,5,B00000FEL2,"I remember watching Bert Quint reporting from Vietnam and other locations around the globe during the 1960's and 1970's for CBS News. I always thought he did a fine job of reporting and narrating, so when I saw the preview on WHYY Channel 12 Philadelphia for this documentary, I made sure to watch it. Definitely two hours well spent. If you like history and geography, particularly from this part of the world, this is the video to get. After watching it I promptly purchased a copy of my own, and have watched it many times since. You see something new every time. Until the end of the Soviet Union occurred in 1991 and this documentary came out in 1996, this part of the world was definitely a more remote part of the world, as Quint points out. You never heard, saw or read much of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, as it was cloaked behind the veil of the Iron Curtain. Bert Quint does an excellent job of lifting that veil from start to finish. This rail line was a true engineering marvel; to link Moscow with the Pacific in the late 1800's and early 1900's absolutely made building the Panama Canal look like child's play. You get a detailed look at various stations along the way, particularly Irkutsk and Novosibirsk. Some dramatic footage of Lake Baikal is also included. The changing of the bogies (wheel assemblies) on the train as it prepares to cross into China is interesting, and Quint gives a not so obvious reminder as to why this is done. The trip through China is very interesting, as you get to see Manchuria, yet another off the beaten path part of the world, as well as a good look at Beijing. A real surprise came toward the end of the video, as Quint and his group take a ride from Beijing to Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, yet another relatively unknown part of the world. I would like to have seen what the route through the Russian Far East from Ulan Ude to Vladivostok looks like, but the alternate route was just as interesting. Bert Quint's style is a perfect match for this documentary, and he is to be commended for it. A great job!",1330128000,,2067,4.485411140583555
7908436,5,B00000FEL2,"I bought this VHS many years ago and have been waiting impatiently for the DVD. Very rarely does a documentary so subtly bring alive both a group of real people traveling far into the Siberian night, but also makes the viewer feel, at their deepest level, the vast expanses involved, and the horrific cost in lives, of the TSR. I was entranced in a way that rarely happens to me. The music is an inspired choice, perfectly suited for it's purpose it haunts, it evokes images of lonely peasants struggling and surviving in the frozen wastes. And yes, as you grown to admire the Russians for their strength and perserverence, and long for a chance to taste the waters of the Baikal, you are never allowed to forget the grinding poverty. I especially enjoy the Chinese and Mongolian sections; even though it's quite clear the narrator has a bias against the Chinese.
I strongly recommend purchasing this VHS although not at exhorbitant prices. Wait and grab it when you can then enjoy.",1182470400,3,982,4.715116279069767
7908437,5,B00000FEL2,"Without a doubt this video surpasses all others of it's kind.  Much longer than most, it combines the scenery of Siberia, China, and Mongolia with music that draws you into the journey.  While you are acquainted with the fellow passengers, the tape does not draw upon them for it's story.  There is a history of the railway and visits to Irkutsk, Beijing, and Ulanbataar.  After viewing this video I have sought information on this part of the world.  Siberia no longer seems daunting, but inviting.",976665600,6,499,4.823529411764706
7908438,5,B00000FEL2,"I purchased this video as I am planning to make the journey along the Trans-Siberian from Moscow to Beijing early next year but sought a brief perception into what to expect before taking the trip.  Starting at Moscow  and covering all three routes, the Trans Siberian, Mongolian and  Manchurian, the video gives a good account of day-by-day life on the train  by following groups of individual passengers taking the journey. Broken up  into sections each with a map of the route, towns, and distances, the video  is well constructed to give good insight of what life is like, not only for  the passengers but also for the staff.  Included is archival footage and  narrative, of how the Trans Siberian was constructed, and also Russian,  Chinese and Mongolian history, with accompanying interviews of indigenous  peoples living along the routes.  After watching the video I found it  surpassed all my expectations, answering all of my uncertainty and  questions. At 120 minutes long it is difficult to describe the detail that  the video goes into, but all I can say is, I'm very glad I bought it and  will differently be taking the trip.",962582400,8,1138,4.87958115183246
