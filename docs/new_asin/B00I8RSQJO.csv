8639894,5,B00I8RSQJO,"This is season 1 of a new automotive series from Velocity.  Unlike so many other car build shows, there is no fake drama, no fake deadlines, no needless yelling, none of the typical reality BS that is so common on TV today.  The 55 Buick they build in this series is beautiful and you see every step of the process.  Starting with the rusted hulk to the final car driving along Route 66 in it's element.

We really love this series and can't wait for the new season 3 to begin.  I would also like to have season 2 on DVD but I don't think it's out yet.",1408492800,,552,4.074074074074074
