8542329,1,B009K095LG,"I wasn't aware that all of the Cougar Town DVDs were not formatted for DVD players in the US.  It didn't specify that they were not playable in the US.  Unfortunately, I did not find this out until now.  Because I gave them as a gift.  Is there anything I can do about this?  Can I return them for an exchange?  This happened with another movie I purchased through Amazon.  The movie was called The Trip.  I ate that one, but I don't want seconds.  Wasn't that good.",1481500800,3,466,4.204545454545454

And they will only let you return it if you don't open it. Now I have 4 seasons of Cougar Town that I can't watch and can't return. If you have an American DVD player

DO NOT ORDER THIS DVD!!!!",1463356800,4,345,4.073529411764706
