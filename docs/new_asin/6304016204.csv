7860200,5,6304016204,"So, Beavis and Butthead are back on the air nowadays.  Let's hope the new stuff is as good as the old classic stuff.  I'm sure it will be.  This VHS tape contains some of the classic stuff.  Feel Our Pain (1996) is one of the best collections of episodes ever.  Here are the episodes:

1. Animation Sucks
2. Bad Dog
3. Tired
4. Bus Trip
5. Patsies
6. Choke
7. Blood Pressure
8. Lightning Strikes

You'll laugh sooooooo hard when you watch these episodes.  Watch these two morons suffer from their own stupidity.  Highly recommended!",1323216000,,532,4.515789473684211
7860201,5,6304016204,"Cool! Another well thought up Video on the Best of Beavis and Butthead. My favorite was ""Blood Pressure"". I give it an A+. I don't understand why they added ""Animation Sucks"", though. It's probably because B&B's cartoon characters were dieing or that they had a struggle with the project. I still give it an A, though because of it's awesome humor. ""Bad Dog"" was a classic episode in my opinion.",1100822400,,395,4.6571428571428575
7860202,5,6304016204,"These days, MTV is full of disgustingly horrible shows such as ""The Real World"", ""Newleyweds"", and ""True Life"", pathetically horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE beyond horrible shows! so much for ""MUSIC"" television- more like ""Stupid reality shows for people who are whiny and depressed and have nothing better to do"" television!
But back in the golden days of the 90s,, MTV had a great show about 2 no-life morons sitting on their couch watching music videos and calling themselves ""fartknockers""- any human being who grew up in the 90s know these 2 ""fartknockers"" as the one and only BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD!
Beavis and Butthead mean so much to my youth- how Green Day were the soundtrack to my youth, Beavis & Butthead were the #1 television show of my youth... Yes, no fan will disagree that the music videos every 5 seconds were very annoying, but well, that WAS back in the day when there was actually GOOD music on the mainstream charts (and it IS where I first saw the video to Green Day's ""Longview""...) The best was hearing Beavis & Butthead making comments about the videos played- ""This sucks!"" ""hehe this song is cool!"" ""woa check out that dead guy!""
But anyway onto this tape... It's hard for me to pick one Beavis & Butthead video because they are all so great, but I had to pick this one, because it was the first one I saw- I still remember... I was over at my friend's house and I wanted to play Sega and he said ""No we're gonna watch Beavis & Butthead!"" I said ""NO I WANNA PLAY SEGA!""- well sure enough, I'm glad he forced me to watch it....
My favorite episode on here is the one where Butthead puts Beavis in a tire and pushes him down a hill,, causing a train to ride off tracks, and Todd to spill soda on his new pants :)
It's a crying shame that MTV had to cancel this great show to devote their time to a dumb show about Jessica Simpson's marriage..... but I still have tons of videos (including the great ""Beavis & Butthead Do America"")
Beavis & Butthead- a 90s pop culture icon, and a truly great memory of my youth. It's hard not to love them. Hehehehehe, I said ""hard"", huhuhuhuhh.",1069718400,2,2099,4.454545454545454
7860203,5,6304016204,"Animation Sucks(A)-Really strong ep.  Here, the b's draw dead people in animation class.  Hilite when Beavis screams ""MASSACARE"".
Bad Dog(A-)-Excellent ep, but not as good as the last one.  Here, the b's get a dog that likes to bite.  Hilite when Beavis gets bit in the nads.
Tired(A)-Another strong ep.  Here, the b's find a truck tire and Beavis goes for a helluva ride.  Hilite when Beavis begins his wild ride.
Bus Trip(A)-Yes! Another A worthy ep.  Here, the b's cause mayhem and madness on a school trip.  Hilite when the b's walk to the front of the bus with their pants down.
Patsies(A-)-Yet another good ep.  Here, the b's are taken by the Positive Acting Teens and end up doing something negative anyway.  Hilite when Butthead confuses the term ""next of kin"" with ""next of skin"".
Choke(A-)-Another good ep?  This tape rules!  Here, Butthead chokes on chicken and Beavis tries to find help.  Hilite when Beavis' help ends up being a ""wash your hands"" sign from Burger World.
Blood Pressure(A)-Whoa! Another A worthy ep.  Here, Beavis gets his arm stuck in the blood pressure sleeve and Butthead does very little to save him.  Hilite when Butthead gives a store clerk adult diapers in exchange for a saw.
Lightning Strikes(A+)-The first straight A b and b tape ends with a bang.  In this ep, the b's get struck by lightning after seeing a Ben Franklin documentarty.  Hilite when the b's get struck.
All n all, I give this ep an A",1041638400,4,1437,4.661354581673307
7860204,5,6304016204,"Feel our Pain is the duo's fifth video and it could quite possibly be their best. No more old episodes this one focuses entirely on new ones and I think that it is a good thing.
-Animation [stinks](A-), Mr. Vandriessen tells the class their next assignment will involve animation, the boys decide to draw dead people. Seeing their final cut of their cartoon was very funny and the highlight was seeing Beavis take a psycho and start screaming massacre.
-Bad Dog(A), Butthead decides that they should adopt a dog and when they find one they like it can't seem to keep itself off of Beavis. This episode makes you laugh out loud and seeing Beavis get his nuts bitten by a dog was just hysterical. You really feel Beavis' pain in this one.
-Tired(A+), Beavis and Butthead roll a tire up a hill and Beavis decides to ride down in it. Best episode on the tape, the mayhem that ensues is classic Beavis and Butthead and there a lots of memorable moments to go around in this episode.
-Bus Trip(A), While taking a field trip to go mountain climbing, Beavis and Butthead decide to moon cars, curse at other people and cause their teacher to fall down a cliff. Once again this is another great episode. Everything is funny including the scene in which they walk to the front of the bus and forget to pull their pants up after mooning cars and Mr. Vandriessens fall is both shocking and funny.
-Patsies(B+), the positive acting teens take Beavis and Butthead out of detention so that they can help them do something positive, they just end up doing something negative. Not the best episode on this tape but it definitly has its moments. Hubcap scene is funny.
-Choke(B), Butthead is choking and it up to Beavis to help him, Goog luck. Alright episode, the best part is when Beavis starts to choke.
-Blood Pressure(A), Beavis decideds to try a blood pressure test thinking its a ride, I think you can guess from the cover what happens next. Once again another classic, Beavis slowing turning red is very funny and Buttheads attempts to free him are so pitiful that its hysterical.
-Lightening Strikes(A-), After watching a documentory on Ben Franklin, our two favorite boys get out the kite and fly it during an electrical storm. Although I am not a big fan of its ending like others are, the shot with them getting struck by lightening and crushed by a tree are well done.
This is a very good tape and like I said earlier could possibly be their strongest. This is the tape I'd advise people to buy and this is the one I show my friends. This is the one newcommers should see first. You won't be dissapointed.",1017792000,5,2599,4.555555555555555
7860205,4,6304016204,"As always, anyone who watched MTV in the 90s knows that Beavis and Butthead were a phenomena that has turned into a cult status today.  The VHS version here helps commemorate that.
This video has a few of the episodes from the MTV show, and as always they're fun to watch. The only bad thing about this is there's only a couple.  By the time you really get into the video and want to see more, it ends.  It's pretty much MTV taking advantage of the whole marketing thing by only having a few episodes per tape, but because the price has lowered to [$$$] it's not a bad deal.  You do have to get the others to really have a sit-down Beavis and Butthead festival and they're pretty good in combo.  They aren't released on DVD and none of the controversial ""Fire!"" ones are there -- mostly because they were sued over that whole incident.
Go ahead and get them -- they're fun.  For more of the episodes, you have to find them through downloadable engines (in poorer copies, I add) and if you're looking for Liquid Television as well, they are available on VHS and DVD -- check it out.  All in all, good, but not quite enough for one tape.  Price, however, can't be beat.",1012176000,3,1167,4.321100917431193
