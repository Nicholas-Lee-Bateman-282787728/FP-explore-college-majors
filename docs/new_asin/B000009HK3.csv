8647990,3,B000009HK3,"False Lady, the story of a man trapped in a woman's body, is a hilarious mixture of sex, slapstick comedy, kung fu and a Chinese ghost story. Bright and energetic performances highlight this fast-moving and wacky script. Playful nudity and romance make this one of the most realistic of the ""transgender"" genre. A must-see for fans.",990662400,,332,4.946428571428571
