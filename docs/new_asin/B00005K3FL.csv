1614571,4,B00005K3FL,I thoroughly enjoyed the beauty of this movie ... the cinematography and editing was stunning as was the wonderful soundtrack. I was moved by the simplicity of the script and appropriate lack of dialogue as so much was captured in the expressions of the fine cast of actors. I found it very believable and poignant ...a must see!,992044800,8,329,4.689655172413793
1614572,4,B00005K3FL,"Sally Potter has done it again.  I  have never seen characters loved by a lens with all they are and all they are not so hauntingly revealed, yet with no malingering to slow the pace.  The little girl Fegele takes it all in, and creates herself as the Suzie she is told to be in order to survive in the world, but finally finds Fegele inside and gradually breaks into her own.
The development of the friendship between Suzie and Lola outshines the potrayal of the romance between Suzie and her gypsy lover, Cesar.  There was a bit too much left unsaid in the relationship between Suzie and Cesar which is the only critism I have of this movie of depth and compassion.
The appearance of Pablo Veron was a well-placed delight which fit into the script nicely.
If you like your characters well developed, lovingly rendered, and with a moving story artistically told, you should not miss this film.",992044800,6,894,4.56875

1614721,5,B00005K3FL,"In the movie The Man who Cried we follow a story of individualism and the struggles of being different in a new society. Audiences follow Susan Susie as she moves to a new country and struggles to learn a new language, while she is ostracized and being made fun of by being called a gypsy she has problems understanding why a gypsy is bad. Growing up Susie has a love for music and through her teacher she learns how music can teach her a new language. This is meant to highlight Susie as the typical Gypsy because in order for people to be considered a Gypsy one has to travel from place to place. Also, the clothes and search for a freedom like lifestyle is what sets them different from the rest which is why we see Susie having a lonesome attitude throughout the beginning of the film. Until she meets Lola, Susie has always felt alone, but a lot like Susie Lola happens to be different herself and they both move in together where they meet men who they share the same lonesome type feelings in Dante and Caesar, played by Johnny Depp.
They all sing Opera and audiences witness the journey of how the two, Lola and Susie, fall in love with these two different kind of men. Caesar, who is more charming and kind hearted is easier for the audience to root for his relationship with Susie since he fondly cares about him. While Dante being more of a manipulative and aggressive character is seen as the antagonist as he tries to seduce Susie once they are both left alone in the show without Lola and Caesar. When Dante is tired of being rejected he reveals that Susie is Jewish which forces Lola and Susie to take immediate action and leave the country of Paris since it was dangerous to be known as Jewish for their time. She flees to America in hopes of finding her father, and finds him near death and that is when she sings to him the song the movie started with.
Some repetitions in this movie that audiences should pay attention to is the meaning of the song that it has on Susie as it opened with it, taught her English, and ended with the same song to her father. That an artist in exile is constantly having to put up with another culture and differences in the way the new culture views people, therefore they have to constantly live in hiding to do what they love; in this movie their love being art. Another repetition audiences should beware is the one of the Gypsy lifestyle and the hardships of being different. Also, that living outside of ones country means that you never truly feel at home, and since gypsies constantly are moving then they never feel safe.  And finally the racism and hatred people had for something different, but all of this makes for an amazing movie filled with angst and suspense.",1392854400,,2725,4.439121756487026

1614723,4,B00005K3FL,"Exiled from their homes, gypsies were not welcomed anywhere. Gypsy people are nomadic and move from place to place. They are seen as an unwanted sideshow and most people look down upon them. Most often the Roma people perform by dancing, singing and expressing their art. Outcast in each town they travel to. They travel with a large group of their own people trying to just be who they are and not be persecuted for it. The film ""The Man Who Cried"" gives an accurate portrayal of these such focal point in Romani Culture and disdain.

This film, The Man Who Cried, Features an all star cast. Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett and John Turturro all star in this film and bring a very real feel with their performance. Christina Ricci is a refugee, Suzie, who in her life resembles the life of a gypsy. She was taking out of her home and sent to england where she grew up surrounded by people who look down upon her because she looked and spoke different. The Children when she was a child in the beginning of the film even called her a gypsy and picked on her. She grows up singing and become apart of a burlesque show. This is where she meets Cate Blanchett's character Lola. The character Lola even looks down on her a bit for being unordinary. Both Characters join a theater Production that John Turturro character, Dante, is starring in. This theater group is a large cast of gypsies that perform and live together. Johnny Depp is one of these members. His name is Cesar. Cesar is seen being the most persecuted for his heritage. Cesar people are performers and several times during the film are shown singing, drinking and dancing together. Dante calls him names and looks down upon him while only Suzie stands up for him. Suzie and Cesar grow fond of each other and soon Dante thinks of Suzie like he thinks of the gypsies. This film shows several ways that the gypsies are treated poorly. Cesar being called names and picked on by Dante is only the beginning. The police raid the gypsies village, arrest and beat the people. They are treated horribly as if they were dirt.

I found this film to be interesting. The way that all the characters interacted with the gypsies showed a good dynamic. Suzie was fond and felt a connection to these people, while Dante and Lola looked down at them. The differences in relationship were contradictory as well. Dante and Lola were money hungry snobs and Suzie and Cesar were passionate and comfortable with just being who they were. I truly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to everyone.",1392681600,,2551,4.604395604395604
1614724,5,B00005K3FL,"This movie was so amazing to watch and actually see he stories connect. In the movie we see little Suzy at first as a gypsy and she are then moved to London and is taught to be British. She has to lose her identity to try to fit into the lifestyle of everyone around her. She then still finds her voice through music of course since she cannot really fully lose herself and where she came from. Through the film you see how hard she tries to conceal who she really is because she does not want to get sent back from where she comes from. To make matters worse she falls in deep love with a gypsy boy.
 Through the movie you still sense that she is still trying to find her way and does not want to lose herself. I think that is why she latches on so greatly to Johnny Depps character. She really falls for him because this is who she really is, at the end of the day it is somehow like in him she finds the lost part of her. Through the movie you cant help but also see the music influences that are given to everyone. It is like somehow within the music there is also a story being told. Suzy has a choice to make at the end of it, does she really need to realize who she is or does she leave to American as she promised her father from the start. It is good to see how difficult it is for her to make the choice because she wants to stay true to herself than anyone else that is around her.",1392163200,,1392,3.9537366548042705

1614727,5,B00005K3FL,"The Man Who Cried is a powerful film about personal connection in a troubled world, in which family, represented by language and music, sustain a young women when her world is continually broken apart.  The happy Shtetl world of Fegele (Christina Ricci) is disrupted when her loving father, who sings to her Bizets Je crois entendre encore, is forced to leave for America to make his fortune. The village is destroyed by a pogram, and Fegele becomes a refugee, seeking her father in America. Sent to Britain instead, she makes a connection when she is overheard singing the Bizet aria and taught to sing. Her voice and home language again enable her to connect: with a downstairs neighbor, a Russian woman named Lola (Cate Blanchett), Lolas opera-singer lover, Dante (John Torturro), who also sings Je crois entendre encore, and with another vagabond, a mysterious gypsy (Johnny Depp.) After the Nazis invade Paris, Fegele is forced to flee again when Dante denounces her and she is warned of danger by the neighbor and Lola.  Fegele finally finds her father in America. The enormously talented Christina Ricci is mesmerizing in the central role, managing to make intensely real both the pain and the strength of her character and, by implication, the human spirit.",1386460800,4,1265,4.990521327014218

It follows a little girl on a mission to find her father who left his family to go to America and work to bring them there. All but the little girl were killed at the start of Hitler's siege against Poland. The ending is satisfying, probably bring a tear or two.

1614743,4,B00005K3FL,"The story shows more horrors of war and Dictatorship.  The Gypsies were treated as badly as the Jews by Hitler's regime.  The big difference is they were much harder to correl..also unlike the Jews they lived easily in forests and could move without being detected.  Another reason is they fought...The European Jews since the time of the Crusades they had been actively persacuted, by the Moors in Spain the Holy Roman Empire which was most of Europe and they pasifists the Gypsies didn't accept domination like the Jews did.  But they were smart enough to pick their fights.  This movie reallly points this out.",1370390400,3,613,4.855769230769231

This is utter rubbish. Art house vibe? Come on. That only makes sense if you believe that art house cinema shows films which are badly lit, poorly paced and badly acted. Depp reprises his 'Chocolat"" role to equally tiresome effect, while Harry Dean Stanton looks like an actor who can't wait for his character to be deported East by the Nazis and save him from further career trauma. I was interested that the Paris flat appears to be located next door to the city aquarium; during love scenes, the wooden lovers are serenaded by singing whales outside the window -now that is Arthouse, and accounts for this review's only star.

Sorry but I'd honestly give it only a nibble. I was barely entertained to say the least, and I don't know maybe it's just me but as a huge Johnny Depp fan (which is the only reason I made the purchase) I have to say this was the only movie of his that I've seen that I REALLY could have done without. I was pretty disappointed with this one.  It was rather slow movie with a plot that seemed to aim at forms of prejudice, desperate times and desperate women. I really found no real enjoyment in it.,even with Depp featured.  I have to give this one a thumbs down if you're looking for a good weekend film.

She spends the rest of the film looking for him and winds up being the only one who survives from their village to follow him to America.  Some parts of the film are sheer terror for a small child and her evolution to a young woman is peppered with the secret she carries.  Christina Ricci plays the young woman tenderly. She meets characters on her road to finding her father and both Johnny Depp and Cate Blanchett embody thier characters with fervor.  It's a passionate film and those who love to feel deeply, will really become absorbed and will enjoy the film greatly.",1310342400,2,756,4.5777777777777775
1614766,1,B00005K3FL,"I love Johnny Depp so I was excited to see this film. I didn't like the way the movie started right from the get go with a man playing hide-and-seek with his daughter, in some grassy depressing field? Weird! I had to get up and find things to do in the kitchen so when I came back Christina was in France and there was some annoying guy singing opera. He was doing a lot of singing. I don't know who was crying but it should have been called ""The man who sings a lot"". Johnny Depp wasn't in the movie enough to be put on the cover. The ugly singing guy was really the one's face they should have put on the cover. I was happy when the movie was finally over and I can't really tell you what it was about except for a Jewish girl who left Russia. Blah, blah, blah.... I was about to cry myself to sleep.

I'm defiantly going to think twice before I buy a movie with a great cast. As an actor this is one movie I would've done just for the money. It surely didn't make me think anything other than Johnny Depp is hot and how I dislike opera.",1308700800,,1039,3.9951923076923075
1614767,2,B00005K3FL,"Recipe for one lame movie:  Pick every cliche you can think of (a solitary girl, a silent but sexy Gypsy on--yes--a white horse, a gold-digging chorine, and an obnoxious opera singer), play one melody ad nauseum,  throw in a few powerful subplots about prejudice, then half bake.

It's a shame this film doesn't reach its potential, as the cinematography is lovely, and the cast is strong.  Cate Blanchett, glittering gold and red, manages to be both over-the-top and touching as a Russian dancer looking for a sugar daddy and sweet times.  Johnny Depp can smolder with the best of them, which is good, because it's pretty much all he gets to do (usually in corners or on horseback) with the occasional enigmatic smile by way of variety.  Christina Ricci does the best she can in the thankless role of Suzie, a squashed flower of a girl whose only real characteristic is her ability to look tiny and vulnerable. She mostly comes across as a big-eyed blank. John Turturro has given excellent performances elsewhere, but the role of the narcissistic singer is written as such a gross caricature, he doesn't get to do much but lip-sync, flail his arms, and glower.

So many things in this movie left me wondering why they were included.  Spoiler alert here--when Suzie loses her virginity to Cesar, why is he so insensitive about it?  He knows she's an innocent--it seems selfish of him to meet his own needs without caring about hers. Are we supposed to believe this supposedly compassionate man has never heard of kissing?  Foreplay?

And why the anti-climactic shipwreck on their way to America?  Is it supposed to be ironic--so near,and yet so far?  But, since Suzie is rescued, it just seems randomly thrown in.

As other viewers have noted, a more interesting story would have been with the ultra-vivid Cate character and the quietly watchful Cesar.

One other quibble: soundtracks are often a highlight of movies for me, but I wanted to mute this one long before the film was over.  The father-daughter theme is terribly overused and cloying.

But, the costumes and sets are handsome, and the horses are gorgeous.  Too bad the set values can't make up for the hackneyed plot.",1299456000,3,2179,4.811827956989247
1614768,3,B00005K3FL,"Johnny Depp is sultry, mysterious, and totally gorgeous as the honorable, family-loving gypsy who rides a magnificent white horse.  If there had been more of him in the film, I might have given it another star....Well, on to Cate Blanchett---she was terrific, too, and lit up every scene in which she appeared.  One can only wonder what a different story it would have been if Depp had been paired with Blanchett.

But here the gypsy is paired with the wide-eyed waif, Christina Ricci.  She seems to pursue him and eventually he gives in and gives her the love she desperately needs.  To a girl who lost her father as a child, Cesar, the Gypsy, provides not only romance but a strong sense of family.

It's Paris in the 30's though and that's not a good place for either Jews or Gypsys.  This is a setting that has proven fertile ground for many fine works of art.  Unfortunately Sally Potter creams the top and just perpetuates stereotypes.  The Ricci character is all good and pure, the English family who took her in and gave her a home are shown as cold and heartless, the Opera singer abuses his Catholic faith by praying for the Germans to win (in a particularly odious scene,) the gypsies are all warm hearted, fun loving folks, etc. etc.

On the plus side, there is some wonderful music and the cinematography is beautiful.  The singing voice of the Suzie character is lovely.

Ricci is an affecting actress but seems to be sleep walking through this role.  I'm not sure it is her fault.  She isn't given many lines to say and has to rely on her giant eyes to express what is supposed to be pain, longing, revulsion and passion.  The trouble is she has the same expression, or lack of it, for all emotions.  We don't really see enough of the real person to get a sense of who she is so I found it hard to sustain interest in her.  As another reviewer commented, she hardly seems like someone the dashing Gypsy would fall for.

Lola, the Russian dancer who does whatever she can to survive, is a much more interesting character.  She is opportunistic, true and we are supposed to hate her for that but on the other hand she does leave the greasy tenor and provides the means for Suzie's escape.  I wish Suzie would have shed a tear for her..but I guess she was so emotionally traumatized by that point that she needed all her force to look for her father.

Tarturro and the other supporting characters do their best.  The actor who played the father has an amazingly expressive face and the child who portrayed the young Ricci is precious.

There are some wonderful scenes.  I particularly like Depp, and his two Gypsy buddies standing on top of their horses as they rode through the streets of Paris.  Then the scene where Depp weeps as his hold his sleeping lover is very moving.  I guess that's where the title comes from?  It really doesn't make much sense.  There's a lot of good stuff in this film; it just doesn't quite come together.  That fact, along with the insulting ethnic stereotypes makes it one to forget.",1283731200,3,3028,4.514705882352941

I just felt that more depth could have been added to the main character and her overall early beginnings with her adoptive family.... Plus more on how she went about finding her father in America. The ending of this movie left one wanting to know more answers....

Sure Susie was eventually reunited with her biological father, but was it a happily ever after one?? Knowing more about what her biological father had been up to while in America with a bit more  detail, would have been great too. Did Cate Blanchett's character make it big in Hollywood? What did Christina Ricci's character end up doing with the rest of her life? And so go the list of questions.",1216857600,,889,4.685897435897436

1614831,2,B00005K3FL,"In this one Johnny Depp portrays a gypsy.  With long hair, a thin moustache and a Romanian accent, he is sly, seductive and sultry.  He appears in about 22 sequences. Cate Blanchette is over the top but so is the character she's playing. Set in the decade between 1927 and the rise of Naziism in Paris in the late thirties, the plot follows the life of a young girl whose father has left for America and who is separated from her family and friends by a pogram.  Ricci plays her as a trauma victim, quiet and depressed through most of the film.

This is the problem - the center of the film, the girl herself, is so boring, so uninteresting, that we find it hard to believe that the charming, man-hungry Blanchette befriends her and that the seductive Depp falls in love with her.  It just doesn't make sense.  She remains a child throughout the film, silent, hardly talking, occasionally singing.  She never becomes a woman emotionally so the interest of others in the narrative doesn't ring true.

The score is truly lovely, weaving some lovely arias around original scoring. The cinematography is good, darkly atmospheric - her world has little light in it.

The story itself is as depressing as it could be.  Hiding her identity as a Russian Jew in Nazi-occupied Paris, she is lusted after, betrayed and finally shipwrecked in her attempt to get to America and reunite with her father who believes her to be dead and who has gone on to father a second family.

The film's title is meaningless and hardly one to attract audiences.  The only man who cries in the film is Depp during their last night together, but since no point had been made before that he doesn't cry, the scene is meaningless.  ALso, one would think a title would refer to a main character, not a supporting one.  Even GYPSY LOVER, bad as it is, would be a more apt title.

To sum up, a depressing film about a depressing girl, made bearable by Depp's sensual performance and Blanchette's exuberant one.",1194825600,5,1975,4.586894586894587

1614835,3,B00005K3FL,"""The Man Who Cried"" starts, literally, from a child's point of view, and even as it pulls back to follow her journey to young adulthood, it never loses the child's sense of life's mystery and enigma.  The first few minutes of the movie establish, with very few words and notable compression, the central events, beginning in the late 1920s, of a little Russian Jewish girl's early life, her separation from her father (who emigrates to America) and the violent circumstances under which she leaves her home and arrives in England. The little girl who started life as Fegele finds herself with a new name, Suzie, in an alien world where the only familiar sight is the gypsies who pass by her school.  This, a photograph of her father, and the memory of the songs he sang are all that is left to her of her old life.  The desire to reach America to find her father never leaves her.

Suzie (played as an adult by Christina Ricci) matures into a pretty girl with a lovely voice who leaves England to become a showgirl in Paris, where she meets Lola (Cate Blanchett), a Russian emigree, Dante (John Turturro), an Italian tenor, and most important, Cesar (Johnny Depp), a Gypsy horseman whose center is as still as hers.  The lives of these characters interweave as the Germans approach, then occupy Paris.  Suzie must decide whether to use the ticket Lola has given her to reach America, or to stay in occupied Paris.

The first minutes of this film are as good as any I've ever seen.  (Claudia Lander-Duke, who plays Fegele/Suzie as a child, is particularly moving.) Though I don't think the movie subsequently ever again quite equals these moments (or that the plot quite supports itself toward the end), the haunting, almost dreamlike, atmosphere created by the wonderful photography, and the central relationship of Suzie and Cesar make the film well worth watching.",1175990400,12,1866,4.773291925465839

It leaves many of the main characters' fate up for interpretation, but none the less unresolved, and therefore detracts from the film as a whole.  On a more positive note, the acting is superb.  Christina Ricci portrays a young girl from a Jewish family in Russia.  As a child, she is sent away during times of Jewish persecution in Russia to find her father who has left for America.  On route, she is separated from accompanying family members and ends up in England.  There she grows to young adulthood and is discovered to have a beautiful singing voice.  Kate Blanchet plays an aspiring singer and opportunist who takes Ricci under her wing. John Turturo, an egotistical, yet very popular tenor reveals a self-centeredness consistantly at the expense of those he feels superior to.  Johnny Depp plays the role of a gypsy performing in the local opera.  The characters blend well.

1614841,5,B00005K3FL,"The film tries to bring together four different types of refugees. Southern Italians who migrated to Northern Italy and became mussolinians. Russian female dancers who fled away from the Bolshevik revolution and are ready to use their bodies to get acquainted with rich people, no matter what. Russian Jews, representing all Jews, running away from persecution, Russian or German, communist or nazi. Gypsies who are at home nowhere and are always shuddering in front of some danger but always fighting with their one and only family, for their one and only family, for survival. And the film covers about 15 years of European history starting in 1927. It is a very sad film with negative events and persecution adding up, year after year to a total deculturization that is imposed onto all those who do not fit - the very word used by the Welsh teacher who will teach Fegele-Suzy how to sing and who was punished for speaking Welsh in school - in the normalized society in which they live. And yet, deep in the deepest depth of one's soul there is an island or a cavern where one is what one has always been and will always be. It is called resilience and the film is a marvelous example of such resilience. One can always survive in one's mind if one believes in the power of human memory: never forget the past, just cultivate it in your mind's eye and it will come back one day. The film is also a powerful lesson of love. Love is the power to convince the one you love to run away from danger and live, though you have to stay behind and fight. And the man who loves Fegele-Suzy that much can cry all night when she sleeps in their last night together and pretend he is asleep when she is ready to go. And yet the film never gets sentimentalese. It remains extremely pure, perfect and does not waste time and energy on self-pity or pathetic schmaltzy compassion.

1614842,5,B00005K3FL,"This story of a Jewish woman in search of her father (separated from him as a child in 1927 Russia), in a time when the world was on the verge of war, is heartbreaking and very real. It is low key but I was riveted. You can feel the underlying tension of knowing, and the subtle buildup of the inevitable invasion of Paris. It chilled me to the bone in one part to hear the sounds of the Germans marching into the city. The movie, considered a sleeper, shows the frightening reality of what it was like to be there at that time in our history and potentially in danger if you were Jewish, a gypsy, homosexual, etc. The acting was superb. John Turturro (Dante), brilliantly plays an Italian arrogant, selfish, self-centered, manipulative opera singer who tries with no success to ingratiate himself romantically into Suzie's life (Christina Ricci, the heroine of the film). Her performance was also excellent. The look on her face throughout the film shows her haunted, yet with a quiet strength in her determination to eventually reconnect with her father. Her rejection of Dante causes her friend and Dante's ex-lover Lola (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett who's Russian accent was excellent) to leave Paris and go to America because her life was in danger. In the interim Suzie has fallen for Cesar, a gypsy horseman played by Johnny Depp, yet another excellent performance. Some people are comparing this gypsy role with the one he played in Chocolat. There is no similarity except for him being softspoken and unassuming. Definitely not a ""character reprisal"". Not Depp's style. The only character he's reprising is his pirate, Jack Sparrow which by now the whole world is aware of.
The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending. The second it ended, it was like I was thrown into shock. Not one for abrupt endings unless the film warrants it. This one did not.

Rarely does a film with this good a cast -- including Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett, a badly miscat John Turturro and Johnny Depp -- come off with less vigor and more questions in the storyline. For instance, what was the father's role in this whole thing and why was the father the focal point at the end?

Briefly stated, the movie is about a Russian Jew separated from her family before the war (Ricci) who is raised in England to become a singer and dancer, befriends a woman in a similiar situation (Blanchett) who together perform in Paris during the time of German occupation in 1940, falls for a striking Magyar (Depp), is announced to the Germans as a Jew by an opera singer (Turturro), and somehow later finds her father to be reunited with her family.

1614867,5,B00005K3FL,"THE MAN WHO CRIED is (fair warning) in the nature of a idealistic chick-flick with an overlay of socio-political importance.  But this film defies pretty much all of the possible negatives, and succeeds almost despite itself.  Christina Ricci is not an actress I like to watch at all - I think she just about ruined SLEEPY HOLLOW - but don't let this bother you in TMWC.  For one thing, she has very few lines to dully deliver, and remarkably enough, she doesn't look foul-tempered or pouty more than once or twice.  Johnny Depp has very few lines, and in previous reviews, is treated as if he is not a principle player, but in fact, his role is critical to the whole story.  The photography and brilliant direction and editing, as well as a breath-taking performance by Cate Blanchett, prove once again that patience is a virtue.  I didn't find the film slow, as some reviewers have, but it is a good idea to just turn off the inner critic and let the film roll.  John Tuturro (sp?) proves, once again, that he has acting chops to burn.  If you've seen OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?, you won't believe his performance in this one as an Italian opera singer - better to say, you WILL believe his performance.

1614869,4,B00005K3FL,"Some films actually play more sensitively on the small screen of home viewing than when they are achingly spread across a large theater screen where all of the flaws show.  For this viewer such is the case for THE MAN WHO CRIED: reduced to the intimate state this little film carries much more weight.  Sally Potter wrote and directed this homage to the effects of WW II on Europe and in doing so created some memorable characters and deft images that linger.

1927, Russia, and a Yiddish singer father (Oleg Yankovsky) sings to his beloved daughter, knowing of the impending gloom that seethes over Russia.  With his family's interests at heart he flees to America, and encourages his daughter Suzie (Christina Ricci) to follow.  Politics knock and Suzie's attempts to join her father results in her landing in England where she is accepted as a foster child by an English couple who try fervently to rid Suzie of her Jewishness for her protection.

Time passes and Suzie moves to Paris to earn money as a singer.  She meets fellow Russian ex-pat Lola (Cate Blanchett) and the two sing in a Parisian theater until they are invited to join the chorus of an opera company headed by Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton) and starring the famous Italian (fascist) tenor Dante Dominio (John Turturro).  Suzie encounters a gypsy Cesar (Johnny Depp) and falls in love.  With the advance of the Nazi troops toward Paris, the opera company fragments, the threat of Jewish and gypsy annihilation becomes a potent force, and Suzie and Lola manage to book passage on a boat to America.  In America she searches for her father only to find him advanced in years, with a new family in tow, and critically ill.  The full circle of the man who cried comes in the quiet of the hospital room, echoing songs of happier times.

Sound sappy? Well, it sort of is, but so much of the plot and script problems pale in the manner in which the film is presented.  The actors are solid (the range of accents demonstrates a lot of coaching) and some are outstanding: Cate Blanchett, John Turturro, Johnny Depp, and Christina Ricci in her most sensitive role to date.  The music is a mlange of Yiddish songs, operatic arias and original score by the highly regarded serious composer Osvaldo Golijov!  The cinematography by Sacha Vierny  is simply breathtaking, whether in the bleak blandness of Russia or the gaudy theatrics of Paris.

1614872,5,B00005K3FL,"I am not usually a fan of the 'gentler genre', but The Man Who Cried is an extraordinary tale of pre-war life and love.  Little Fegele is sent away by her father to go to America where she will be safe, but Fegele winds out in England instead, where she is renamed Suzie and raised as English instead of the Russian Jew that she is.  Suzie (Christina Ricci) remembers her father singing, and when she comes of age, she leaves for Paris to be near the theaters.

She meets Lola (Cate Blanchett) and the two girls decide to room together.  They are friends, though watching them is like looking at night and day.  Performing in the theater where they work is opera singer Dante Dominio (John Turturro), with a beautiful voice and a considerable ego.  Lola takes up with Dante, much to Suzie's dismay, about the same time Suzie becomes interested in the gypsies that perform along with the theater.

Enter Cesar (Johnny Depp), who plays roles in the theater's performances with his gorgeous white horse.  Suzie is drawn to him, the feeling very clear that it is not just Cesar's smoldering good looks but a sense of affinity with him that calls to her, both of them being outcasts in some way.  What follows are a couple of 'Hello Vicar' sensually passionate scenes between Ricci and Depp (Yowza!) as they find love with each other.

But pre-war France was a dangerous place for Jews, and when the jealous Dante exposes Suzie, which infuriates the gold-digging Lola enough to leave him, Suzie must say goodbye to Cesar and travel on to America to try and find her father.

'The Man Who Cried' is a very pretty movie, not deep in plot but visually moving, truly a piece of cinematic eye-candy.  The photography and the brilliant acting by Ricci, Depp, Blanchett, and Turturro carry this movie all the way to five stars.  The soundtrack to the movie is wonderful, with some very moving operatic pieces that enhance the overall feel of the film.

1614873,5,B00005K3FL,"This film is for those Johnny Depp fans who were not fans of his during his days as a young Tom Hanson in 21 JumpStreet. He plays a brooding, sexy gypsy, with little dialogue and big expressive eyes, who roughly takes Christina Ricci's virginity in a dirty, torn armchair after sending her smoldering looks from the back of his white stallion. His departure from the movie leaves a very anticlimactic feeling, as we continue to follow Ricci's character Susie after she has walked away from the feigning-sleep Depp character. Our last glimpse of Depp's character Cesar, opening his eyes at her departure, left me thinking that the film was over, as I stopped caring what happened to Susie, Lola( Cate Blanchett) and Dante (John Turturro), and focused on what I imagined his fate would be as a gypsy in Nazi-occupied Paris. This movie, writen and directed by Sally Potter, clearly exploits the fantasy of the sexuality of handsome gypsy men, and left me (a 40-something yr. old academic who should know better) daydreaming of Cesar and I riding off on his horse. The young girl who plays Ricci as a child, distanced from her father and torn from her whole world life, is very touching to watch, and I cried as she smashed photos in her new foreign home. My biggest complaint about this film is that while Depp can act just by blinking his eyes, Ricci's similar acting style did not seem as convincing to me, and I waited for her to show more expression in her huge, blank, puppy-dog eyes. She did not seem as convincing in her role as Depp, Blanchett and Turturro did in theirs, and I was painfully embarrassed at her singing, which was mentioned throughout the film as if it was spectacular (it most definitely was not)! This is a film that shows another side of Depp, and those who only think of him as Edward Scissorhands, Gilbert Grape, or Captain Jack Sparrow should watch this for his final scene with Ricci, where he speaks volumes by remaining silent, and left me sighing with longing for this wonderful character.",1112918400,25,2020,4.692957746478873

In fact the entire cast is outstanding and all play their roles well, but perhaps some of the sumptuous meandering of the story could have been skipped. In any case, the story revolves around Fegele, a Russian Jewish girl who is separated from her beloved father and sent to England, where she is reared as ""Suzie"". Eventually she becomes a showgirl and goes to Paris, where she befriends and rooms with ""Lola"", played beautifully by the multitalented force of Cate Blanchett. The cinematography and scenery is beautiful; the music is beautiful. Everything is lush and colorful.

However, Nazism is on the rise, Fegele/Suzie is hiding her true Jewish origins, and things are becoming strained between Lola and Suzie, as Lola is romancing a passionate Italian opera singer (John Turturro). Suzie's real desire and driving need is to see if her father is still alive and if so, can she find him?

Although many people have said that Johnny Depp's appearance in the film elevates the film, I am not entirely sure that there is a lot of point to his character or the storyline involving him. It was neither good nor bad, but I don't view it as central to the film except to further Suzie's character development as a deeply feeling young woman, someone who has experienced loss and will experience it again. Eventually she will look for her father and will reunite with her friend Lola, but overall there was a sense of misdirection and unfortunately disorganization.

1614888,2,B00005K3FL,"The #1 best thing about this movie is that Johnny Depp is in it. He has that transcendent, magical ability to give a performance that elevates any movie in which he appears. The #2 best thing is the attention lavished on production values particularly cinematography and art direction. Visually the film can be stunning; it has a romantic otherworldly aura.  Now it is the story that doesn't quite work. Did this movie start out as one thing and evolve into something else? Is this a movie about people caught in cataclysmic circumstances beyond their control or the story of doomed lovers?  I couldn't make up my mind. Neither one of these premises stands on its own and here woven together just doesn't quite hang.

It is disappointing that the characters are not fully realized and little more than stereotypes; the searching waif, the seductive gypsy, the blonde gold digger with a heart of gold, the temperamental, self-enamored opera star. The title itself though provocative seems an after- thought. Yes, Cesar the gypsy cries when he and Susie part under desperate circumstances, and his tears emphasize the poignancy of the separation, but this part of the scene seems tacked on, and gratuitous.

Which leads me into the main problem with this movie. Throughout it suffers from the palatable lack of chemistry between Johnny Depp and Cristina Ricci. There is just no heat between these two which makes the love story difficult to buy. (For doubters of this phenomenon I refer you to their pairing in ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"").

The Man Who Cried is not an entire washout.  The story has some sentimental charm and John Turturro and Cate Blanchett are always worth watching. And as for Johnny Depp...he's worth watching any old time.",1098316800,18,1746,4.921768707482993

Suzie's escape brings her to England where she is adopted and forced to assimilate to the British traditions and culture that eradicates her of her own past.  Years later when Suzie has reached adulthood she travels to Paris with hopes to raise money that can bring her to her father in the United States.  In Paris she meets love, dreams, hope, and horror as she must face anti-Semitism brought to France by the Nazi's during World War II.

A lot happens in this movie.  It just all happens very....oddly.  There is very little dialouge. Scenes shift from people singing on stage to people staring at each silently to wandering around.  Every time you expect some type of drama or excitement, the scene changes.
While the movie progresses, we see different lives: Russian jews, roaming gypies, the opera. We really don't get any sort of feel for their lives though. We see five minutes of each, usually little understand since it's in a foreign language.
There doesn't seem to be any real emotion in the movie. Susie's village is burned, the Germans march through Paris...but no one really seems to care!  We get one emotional scene between Ricci and Depp, but even then it's not expressed well.

 Why does the father look like a reformed Jew while the other Jews in the shtetl are fashionably Chassidic?
 Why do some of them speak Yiddish, while others ( during the late gathering) speak German?
Why the Jewish village is burned down and during what war in Russia in 1927?!
 Why does the girl's father look rather young comparing to his cherished photograph showing a grey-haired old grandpa with abundant facial hair?
 Why supposedly a Moscovite dancer (Cate Blanchette) doesn't immediately get that her friend is Jewish, and not Russian, while looking at her father's unambiguous photo and reading the last name Abramovich?!
 Why is an actor, who plays girl's father, and whom we see right at the beginning of the film, and right at the end; whose masterful portrayal of a loving parent is so nuanced and multilayered that it shames all other ""great"" actors in this production, why is he named only at the end as ""Father: Oleg Yankovsky""?

Although the film starts in Russia, the main action of the film doesn't begin until Suzie (Ricci) arrives in Paris and gets a job with the opera company. If I had been in the editor's chair, I would have opened the story in Paris, introduced our heroine as the newly hired member of the company, and brought out her history in conversations with the other characters. Cate Blanchett has the best role in the movie as Russian dancer, Lola. John Turturro gives a good performance as the sleazy Italian opera singer and Johnny Depp is excellent in the small role of Cesar, the brooding Gypsy horse trainer Suzie falls in love with. Depp is one of those actors who can speak volumes with just a twitch of his cheek muscles. I would add that I thought Suzie/Cesar's love scenes were well-handled. For my money, the most touching moment of the film was when Cesar (Depp) weeps over his sleeping lover (Ricci) whom he knows he will never see again. Ricci, while a competent actress, has very little to do here except look pensive and long-suffering. My advice on the film: rent, but don't buy.",1062720000,37,1172,4.666666666666667

The score deserves a mention, too.

Christina Ricci, a truly gifted young actress, plays the daughter of Russian Jews, separated from her only surviving relative, her father, by continents and years.

Johnny Depp plays one of the gypsies hired as bit players. It takes a while, but eventually Ricci and Depp meet and share their lives.

1614946,4,B00005K3FL,"""The Man Who Cried"" is not at all as terrible as many (re)viewers purport it to be.  Sure, it has some questionable moments and developments but redeeming qualities abound in it as well.  It is a movie-ballad of sorts.  Its strengths are in compelling musical highlights and background, vivid -- troubled and resilient -- characters, the provocation of emotion.  ""The Man Who Cried"" is like an elaboration on a legend -- colorful, passionate, with leaps of faith, one where fate is both contested and inevitable.
All actors deliver undeniably strong performances.  Cate Blanchett is unsurprisingly exquisite in the role of a resourceful, hedonistic but emphathetic seductress.  John Turturro's marvelous acting is successfully flavored with obsessive streaks evident earlier in ""The Quiz Show"" and ""The Luzhin Defense"".  Johny Depp is back in the 'noble savage' saddle (a character well that may be running dry).  Christina Ricci is exciting, devoted, endearing, and intense, as usual. Oleg Yankovsky (one of Russia's top actors) is strong in his small but spirited role.
As has been pointed out by others, the script may be the movie's weakest feature, with all but perhaps one character (Blanchett's Lola) yearning for stronger lines, or at least more of them.  Yet, both a minimalist script and a plot that is not particularly inventive or complex can be justified by the movie's attempt to play more like a ballad than a novel.
Deep icy blue is the film's signature color and is at times joined by brilliant reds and sparse whites.  The DVD's bonus notes mention that Sally Potter drew inspiration for the scenes and locations from Cartier-Bresson's and Koudelka's photography -- something that doesn't quite come across in the movie.

1614950,3,B00005K3FL,"""The Man Who Cried"" is a handsome, episodic film which has several visually brilliant moments and some fine performances. It does not ultimately, however, add up to a particularly satisfying emotional whole. The script by Sally Potter, who also directed, tries to cover too many events occurring over a period of at least twenty years.
The movie begins in rural Russia where a little Jewish girl named Suzie lives in a village with her father and grandmother. The father leaves her behind to seek a better life in America. He promises to send for her, but violence and warfare come to her region, and she winds up a refugee in England. All she has left is a tattered photograph of her father. She is taken in by a middleclass family. She learns to sing and dance, but she never feels the joy those talents can bring. As a young adult [played by Christina Ricci], she decided to go to Paris. She meets Lola [Cate Blanchett], a beautiful, tempestuous fellow Russian expatriate. They become friends and roommates. Lola sets her sights on famous opera singer [John Turturro], while Suzie's heart is stolen by a gypsy [Johnny Depp]. The snobbish, bigoted opera star doesn't like the fact that Suzie runs around with such lowlife. He also taunts her for being Jewish. When the Nazis invade Paris, her life becomes increasingly chaotic. If only she can find a way to make it to America...
Christina Ricci, one of our finest and most adventurous young actresses, is excellent. Hers is a difficult role because she has so few lines to speak and must convey a great deal through body language and facial expressions. The great Cate Blanchett is given plenty to say and says it all with her usual finesse. Johnny Depp and John Turturro make the most of their smaller but important roles.
Perhaps the greatest contribution is made by Sacha Vierny, whose masterful cinematography goes a long way in masking the deficiencies in Ms. Potter's script.",1030665600,14,1934,4.793413173652695

1614952,2,B00005K3FL,"I rented this movie with no advance knowledge of it -- hadn't read any reviews or talked to friends. Knew of Sally Potter's reputation as an original and interesting filmmaker. But having now seen the whole sad thing, I wonder what she really meant to accomplish. These wonderful, skilled actors -- Ricci, Turturro, Blanchett, Depp, Stanton -- are forced to work with almost nothing in the way of a script (or direction?). Ricci and Depp are the least fortunate, since they are given almost nothing to say, either to each other or their colleagues. They do great work with a handful of deep, ""meaningful"" glances at each other, etc., but we never really get to know them or develop sympathy for their characters. On the other hand, Turturro's opera divo gets to talk a lot, but it's all Standard Fascist Bigot Blather. You very soon want him to put a sock in it! Surely there's more to his character than that, and ditto for Cate Blanchett's Russian gold-digger.
I have to disagree strongly with the reviewers who praised this movie's historical verisimilitude. In the central, pre-WW2 Paris section, I felt that the general atmosphere (visuals), characters' behavior, sequence of events, and more did NOT create a convincing picture of that time or place. The principals seem to wander about lost in their own immediate concerns, completely unaware of the rise of French fascism, of the danger posed by Hitler, etc. Potter attempts to give us some sense of what is going on, with quick little tableaus showing innocent Jews being hauled off, property being burned. But these are handled in an almost abstract fashion, and it's hard to relate them to the love quadrangle.  Turturro's ""prayer scene"" on the eve of the German invasion is ludicrously unbelievable, as is the apparent ease with which Blanchett's character facilitates one of the last plot twists of the Paris episodes.
Two stars go for the cinematography (not the editing however) and especially for the effective use of music. Golijov's original score and also the opera arias, gypsy tunes, etc., make a very effective mix -- they provide almost the only atmosphere and emotional input in the whole movie.",1027641600,8,2169,4.942465753424657
1614953,3,B00005K3FL,"...while I was still eating the main course!  That's how I felt about this movie.
It's so beautiful, I WANTED to love it.  I'm a Depp fan, and he and Ricci make a lovely couple.  Cate Blanchett is looking her best, and the plot is interesting.
Fegele is a young Jewish woman who has been separated from her family as a child.  Raised in England by distant foster parents, she longs to go to America to find her father, but has to earn enough money first.  Along the way, she meets a smolderingly handsome gypsy (Depp), a kindhearted Russian gold-digger (Blanchett), and a very self-centered Italian opera singer (Turturro).  Meanwhile, the Nazi menace is approaching, and it's no good time to be a Jew in Europe.  So far, so good.
Unfortunately, you don't get a chance to really grab hold of this movie.  Characters don't do much talking (well, except the opera singer, but who wants to hear him rant?).  There's a lot of dialogue conducted via soulful looks and silent reproaches.  All very nicely done, but it's up to you to figure out what characters are really thinking and feeling.
But here's thing that really bugged me:  The ending.  If you like to have the loose ends all tied up when the credits roll, you'll be disappointed.  I felt the ending was rushed, and could've easily done with another 30 minutes or so.  Instead, I was left wondering what would've happened next.

1614955,5,B00005K3FL,"""The Man Who Cried"" is a feast for the eyes and ears alike. One recent review called it ""the art-house companion to Moulin Rouge,"" and that doesn't seem too far off. The film begins with Fegele and her father in 1927 Russia, with a beautifully photographed game of hide and seek. Fearing for his family's safety, her father sends her away to America, but Fegele ends up in England by mistake, is renamed Suzie and is raised by a grim British couple. The scenes of the Russian shtetl are grim, and colour truly doesn't become pronounced until we see the cabaret shows of Paris, the gaudy costumes and headdresses and the opera sets.
Suzie (Christina Ricci) runs into fellow showgirl Lola (Cate Blanchett) and the two room together, locking horns over Italian sensation Dante, the main draw at the theatre, who also happens to be a fascist. Lola gets her way and her man. Enter one very mysterious, brooding Gypsy horseman (Johnny Depp, reprising his role from Chocolat) who captures Suzie's heart. This entire whirlwind of music, passion and drama occurs on the eve of World War Two, and Suzie is in danger of being discovered as Jewish.
The cinematography is gorgeous, with washed-out colours in Russia, beautiful cityscapes of Paris (especially the bike/horse chase at night!), gaudily bright costumes and opera sets, the exotic colour, music and flair of the Gypsy camp and costumes. The colour brings to mind the brilliant Technicolour prints of the earlier days, with vibrant, surreal colours.
The soundtrack is equally stunning, with contributions by newcomer Italian tenor Salvatore Licitra, the Kronos Quartet, the Gypsy ensemble Taraf de Haidouks, and Czech songstress Iva Bittova providing the voice for Christina Ricci. The operatic selections by Bizet, Puccini, Purcell, and Verdi are balanced by original score (the stunning ""Close Your Eyes"" is the most beautiful song in the movie) and frantic Gypsy music. Bittova's ""Gloomy Sunday"" is a delightful study in atmosphere, and appropriately sets the tone for an onscreen event near the end of the film.
""The Man Who Cried"" is an unusual, beautiful, and touching glimpse at a decadent Europe on the brink of war, the vibrant Gypsy culture, the Jewish shtetls of Russia, and the world of opera, all intertwined with romance and connections to the past.",1017532800,238,2311,5.0365535248041775

By the time the Germans invade Paris, you're ready to exit this film as well.
***  Director Sally Potter's previous films include ""Orlando"" (based on the novel by Virginia Woolf) and ""The Tango Lesson"" in which she starred and even performed as a dancer.  The latter is a wonderful, almost-documentary electrified by the commanding soulfulness of the tango.
***  ""The Man Who Cried"" has more in common with the difficult and overlong ""Orlando.""  Despite Potter's artistic eye and sense of striking imagery, the storytelling remains muddled.  You're really not sure why you're supposed to care about the characters.  The spotlight follows Ricci even though she seems obviously uncomfortable and ready to bolt.  The supporting roles criminally underuse Blanchett and Depp who both deserve more.
***  The most compelling aspect of ""The Man Who Cried"" concerns Ricci's character and the search for her father who left Russia for America.  This, however, is given the least amount of screen time.  In fact, you can watch the first fifteen and the last fifteen minutes of the film and be done with it.",1014768000,,1464,5.05
1614987,2,B00005K3FL,"From the haunting opening notes of ""Je crois entendre encore"", through the first scenes with the darling little Russian girl I thought I would like this film.  But as it went along, not only did the characters become less believable, they just devolved into broad, insulting stereotypes. The film did pretty well equally insult every race, religion and ethnic group they came across, so it didn't single anyone out.  They all seemed like ethnic cartoons!  The score, however almost saves it.  Well, no, it doesn't.  There are plenty of great recordings of 'Les Pecheurs de perles' and ""La Favorita"" out there.  No need to subject yourself to this.",1014422400,7,647,4.944444444444445
1614988,2,B00005K3FL,"Under the yoke of persecution, people-- collectively or individually-- will find a voice, a way to communicate their plight to the world, to anyone who will listen.  Sometimes the whole world will hear that cry, but often it will fall on deaf ears.  ""The Man Who Cried,"" written and directed by Sally Potter, is just such a story, of a people-- Jews-- unimaginably persecuted and attempting to find their voice, that common expression of their suffering and turmoil.  And, as is won't to happen in extreme situations, that expression will manifest itself in terms that are universal and defy the barriers of language.  The ""Man"" in this story can be found in hu-MAN-ity, and his cry can be found in the common expression of song:  In the aria of the opera, in the songs of the gypsies camping on the outskirts of Paris, or in the a capella intonations of a young Russia girl, a Jew, exiled from her home and adrift, alone, in a world of incomprehensible confusion.
 The story begins in Russia, 1927; a man (Oleg Yankovsky) is forced to flee the country for America, leaving behind his young daughter, for whom he hopes to send later, once he is settled.  Very soon, however, the preadolescent girl is forced to leave, as well, and winds up alone in England, at a school, where she is given the name ""Suzie,"" and, being an outsider, suffers the taunts of her peers.  And through it all, what keeps Suzie (Christina Ricci) going, is the thought that some day she will be able to join her father (from whom she has not heard since his departure from Russia) in America.  In the meantime, Suzie finds solace in singing, while her personal odyssey eventually takes her to Paris (at a most inopportune time for a Jew), where she becomes involved with a dancer named Lola (Cate Blanchett), a renowned opera singer, Dante Dominio (John Turturro) and an enigmatic gypsy, Cesar (Johnny Depp).  Now a young woman, Suzie's dreams of America have diminished somewhat, but as the Nazi war machine begins cutting a swath across Europe, her thoughts, with renewed fervor, yet mingled with doubt, turn again to the possibility of joining her father in America.
 As with her previous effort, ""Orlando,"" in 1993, Sally Potter had a definite vision of how to approach and present her story.  Unfortunately, she seems unable-- or unwilling-- to share that vision with her audience.  The story itself is interesting, if not original, but her disjointed, abstract methods of presenting it make it too obscure to embrace.  On the surface, what some may initially consider an imaginative rendering of the material dissolves under closer scrutiny, and the artistic, abstract presentation is revealed as nothing more nor less than the effects of awkward transitions that defeat the very vision Potter was attempting with this film.  The ""transitions,"" in fact, which are so vital to the telling of the story, are actually not so much transitions as they are lurches or jumps, which dramatically distorts the flow of the film.  Add to that the lack of character development or delineation, as well as Potter's inability to maintain any tension whatsoever, and the result is a film that is emotionally uninvolving and, at best, unapproachable from the standpoint of the audience.  Visually, it has it's moments, especially in the silent exchanges between Suzie and Cesar, but they are simply too few and far between to sustain any interest.  And it's unfortunate, because Potter had all the tools with which to work, but didn't know what to do with them.
 The performances, too, suffer the same fate as the presentation of the film.  Ricci looks stunning-- very reminiscent of a young Elizabeth Taylor, in fact-- and her performance is the highlight of the film; Suzie, at least, is believable.  Ricci does well with the material she is given-- which isn't much-- and her lack of dialogue and extended moments of silence may mask, somewhat, the ambiguity of the character.  She is wonderfully expressive, however, which at least adds a touch of mystery to Suzie, who because of Potter's lack of attention is not nearly as sympathetic a character as she should be.  Ricci has developed a powerful screen presence, quite apparent though unemployed in this film, and hopefully in her next project she will have a director who knows how to use it.
 Like Ricci, Cate Blanchett does the best she can with the material, but under Potter's unsteady hand Lola seems out of step with her environment, and despite Blanchett's best efforts comes across as more caricature than character.  She certainly tried, however, and attempted to get more out of Lola than was humanly possible.  A poorly written stereotype, there was nothing Blanchett could do to save herself, or the character, with this one.
 John Turturro suffers the same fate, only more so.  Without the necessary guidance, he seems to have a hard time immersing himself into Dante's skin.  It's a good effort, but Turturro as Dante is like putting a square peg in a round hole; he just doesn't fit.  And the singing voice provided for him defies credibility.
 Depp, as well, seems at odds with his character, Cesar, though he suits the part of the silent, brooding gypsy quite well.  Again, it's a case of being all dressed up with nowhere to go.  The character was not so much poorly written as too ambiguous; to be effective (as he could and should have been), Cesar simply needed some direction, and it was not there.
 The supporting cast includes Harry Dean Stanton (Perlman), Hana Maria Pravda (Grandmother) and Claudia Lander-Duke as young Suzie (the best bit of casting in the film; very credible as a young Ricci).  The most positive thing that can be said of ""The Man Who Cried"" is that it had such potential.  Alas, it was never tapped; and you're left with the thought of what could have been.",1012262400,7,5826,4.837701612903226
1614989,2,B00005K3FL,"I rented this movie on recommendation from the trailer. The trailer looked very good, however the movie was abysmal. It was truly painful to see such fine actors so out of place. The story was extremely contrived and maudlin.  I just could not finish it out. I watched the last half on forward. Everyone looks wonderful and the costumes and sets are outstanding. The plot reminded me of a Danielle Steele type short story.",1011657600,2,422,4.702702702702703
1614990,5,B00005K3FL,"I almost did not buy this movie after reading the reviews by
critics.  I got it after much ordering and canceling, and I
tell you, its the best $... I ever spent.  This movie is the
best acted, best story-line, best all around movie I have seen in years. If you are an action, blood & gore person forget it.  If you love a wonderful movie, with great scenery, this is your
movie.  Christina Ricci, Suzie, is amazing in this role.  She
can show more emotion with a simple look, than most actors ever
show.  As a young Russian Jewish girl, beautifully played by
young Claudia Lander-Duke, she is forced to flee Russia, and trying to get to America, where her father went looking for the American Dream, she is sent to England instead. Sent to live
with foster parents who show no emotions, she is told she must
""fit in"", and instead of living her life, she attempts to live
the life that people she meets want her to live.  Suzie loves
to sing, but takes a job in France as a dancer, to try to get
to America.  In France, Suzie meets Lola, played by Cate Blanchett, in her dance troup, a golddigger, who really loves Suzie, but her fear of going back to the the proverty of Russia, make her make decisions that are bad for her.  Dante Dominio,
John Turturro, an Italian opera tenor whose self-centerness stems from his desire to prove his mother's sacrifices for him were worth it, seems to be Lola's dreams come true, but although, he takes Lola, he really desires Suzie.  Cezar, played brillantly by Johnny Depp, the gypsy with nothing, but the love of Suzie's life, for with Cezar she finds herself, the real
Suzie.  This movie brings to life what it must have really
been like Pre-World War II France, with all the prejudices
and fears of the different classes of people.  One critic
said Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp have no chemistry, wrong...these two can can take your breath away with just a look.  Cate Blanchett is beautiful, and your heart will go out to her. John Turturro, you will love to hate.  I have never seen a movie only 90 minutes long that could bring so many characters to life, and by the end you feel you really know all of them, their wants, needs, and desires, and you feel real
empathy with them.  From its beautiful scenery, to the breath-taking opera songs, this movie has it all.  I am so glad I did
not follow the movie critics reviews, and decided to order
the DVD.  I have now watched this movie four (4) times, and
may watch it 40 more.  It is a got to see, no matter what you
read.  Maybe Sally Potter should do a Man Who Cried Part II,
to see what happens to Suzie and Cesar after the war.  Five

1614991,2,B00005K3FL,"Throughout the duration of ""The Man Who Cried,"" I found myself searching for a light at the end of the tunnel, something with which to spark some interest in my skeptical mind for this drawn-out, listless and emotionally empty film. Perhaps my dislike for Sally Potter's latest venture into the artistic canvas of human suffering is my own fault; after all, if one spends a movie's entire desperately trying to like it, where does it get him but right back where he started?
There is a certain sense of awe and wonderment about a failure such as this; you have to admit that there were some good intentions at work in this picture. Potter incorporates a style that accentuates the period's flavor and dark times exquisitely, but to call it a style over substance film is a hit and miss. There are times when the visual integrity of the film is the only thing worth watching for, and then there are times when the plot itself is so outlandishly dreary that keeping one's eyes open becomes a chore.
Potter's tale begins in Russia, 1927, exploring the childhood years of little Susie, who is separated from her beloved father when he ventures from home to begin a new life in America. As an adult, she moves to Paris to explore her options as a singer, and ends up befriending Lola (Cate Blanchett), a dancer who aspires to have wealth and fame through marriage. She finds this in an Italian opera singer, Dante Dominio (John Turturro), whose boisterous ego and support of the Nazi presence in Paris are a threat to Susie, whose Jewish background remains secret.
As far as period pieces are concerned, this one carries its fair share of opulent imagery, beauteous music and operatic flow that gives the film an offbeat feel. But there is little more than this exercise in style to enjoy about the movie: it's pacing is slow in a way that is almost sleep-inducing. while the realistic events involving the Nazi invasion of Paris is never really expanded upon.
It's a shame, no doubt, considering the chances the film had to redeem itself. There is some small degree of tension created once it becomes known to Dante that Susie is of a Jewish heritage, as he tries to keep her under his wing with the threat of revealing her past. Sadly, the movie never goes anywhere with this, settling for the soapy romance of Susie and a handsome gypsy named Cesar (Johnny Depp), which, despite the warm chemistry between Depp and Ricci, is reduced to little more than a few sessions of lovemaking and a final goodbye that holds little emotional resonance.
The dislike of the film's characters cannot be blamed on the cast; each does considerably well with their parts. Ricci is subtle and able to evoke emotion with her steely eyes and cold yet warm appearance, while Depp is moody and sensual as Cesar. Both actors do not speak much during the film, though no dialogue is needed to understand them. Blanchett dons an authentic French accent as Lola, and conveys her change in life with superb talent, while Turturro is subtly sinister as Dante.
But in the face of such a banal, drippy love story that practically bleeds of corn syrup and the bittersweet tears of its cardboard characters, ""The Man Who Cried"" is a beautiful yet deceptive exercise, one that promises depth but delivers little of it. It's an interesting failure, one that seems to have the makings of a better movie if not for its insistence on a deliberately slow pace and unmoving characters.",1010620800,3,3443,4.701986754966887
1614992,5,B00005K3FL,"It's a shame that ""The Man Who Cried"" could not receive the due attention of the audience; for in my book this is one of the best films I ever seen this year.
The film is about a Jewish girl living in Russia early in 20th century, who must go on a long way to search for her own father who left her to work in America.  As the oppression against the Jewish people began there, she also has to start her own journey to survive with a coin and a photo as her only memory as childhood, knowing only a single English word, ""America.""  (As movie fans know, this historical facts are shown in ""Fiddler on the Roof"" in a different way.)  Instead of going to America, the girl lands in England, deprived of her own name, to start a new life there.  But can she meet him again?
First of all, you must keep in mind that the director's style is different from that of others.  The dialogue, especailly in the opening thirty minutes, are as sparse as possible, and Sally Potter leaves the beautiful images alone, letting them tell what they show.  It is this techinique that works well in ""The Man Who Cried,"" and watching this film is like going through pictures in museum.
And through the stunning images comes very emotional moment between the credible characters.  Though her Russian accent sometimes may grate on you, ever changing Cate Blanchett is ravishing and shows great acting (as usual).  However, the greatest surprise and achievement come from Christina Ricci, whose numerous works range from good (""The Ice Storm"") to so bad (""Bless the Child"").  Without capitalizing on her previous image as a strange little girl she established in ""The Addams Family,"" Ricci displays her best performance as a beautiful heroine.  Her quiet but touching face exudes emotional tension with Johnny Depp, and their quiet parting scene moves you to tears.  Actually her eye speaks as much as any dialogue you hear in recent noisy movies.  Ricci's fans must see it.
Visually impressive (the last film by a cinemotograher Sacha Vierny from France, who is responsible for many Peter Greenaway films) ""The Man Who Cried"" is a must to see if you like art house movies.  And watch the glorious photograhy that reminds you of colorful photoes you see in old magazines.  The colors are bursting on screen.",1009152000,12,2281,4.67
1614993,4,B00005K3FL,"The film starts in Russia in the early 20th century, with a Jewish man and his young daughter frolicking in the snow-filled forest.  Their love for each other is apparent and she is big-eyed with tears when he leaves her with her grandmother and goes to America.  Right after that, their village is attacked and she has to flee in a small horse-drawn cart with other children.  She is the only survivor and somehow manages to get to a boat.  She wants to go to America, but is instead sent to England, given foster parents and sent to a strict English school.  The young actress, Claudia Lander-Duke, is wonderful. She doesn't speak much, but her eyes tell it all.
Always searching for her father, the young girl grows up to be Christina Ricci with an English accent. She goes to Paris to earn enough money to go to America by working in a music hall and shares an apartment with Cate Blanchard, cast as a Russian gold digger who trying to develop a relationship with an Italian opera star played by John Turturro.  He believes in Mussolini and supports the Nazis who are gaining strength and about to march on Paris.  Johnny Depp plays a gypsy who falls in love with Cristina Ricci.  The political situation in Paris gets worse and worse, especially because she is Jewish.
There's some excellent directing and camerawork in this film, with muted colors portraying the harsh Russian winter.  As this is a low budget film, we never see any of the large action scenes; we only see the characters' reaction to them.  This really works well.  I also found myself caring about the characters and, at times, I actually had tears in my eyes.  At only 97 minutes, the film is just the right length, and it held my interest throughout.
But there was something missing which is hard to define. Johnny Depp rode a white stallion in almost every scene and this seemed much to surreal; Christina Ricci had a lot less of the fire I've come to expect from her performances; some of the scenes moved a little slow for my taste; and I just couldn't quite believe that a young Jewish refugee would be swept up at the dock and sent to England instead of America.  I'm glad I saw the film though.  I did enjoy it.  There's a lot to like about it.  I just can't say it was great and tell you to rush to see it.  Not bad.
