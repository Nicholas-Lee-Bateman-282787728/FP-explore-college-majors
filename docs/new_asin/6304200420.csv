It features interviews from Garry Bushell , Cockney Rejects ,  The Business , and The Last Resort. However the terrible live footage can be appreciated as alot of it is rare and historical. High points for the live footage is Sham 69's ""Borstal Breakout"" , Cockney Rejects ""I'm Not A Fool"" , The Business ""The Real Enemy"" , Red Alert ""In Britain""..then there is the horrible Splodgenessabounds ""Two Pints Of Lager And A Bag Of Crisps"" and the even worse promo for the Toy Doll's awful song and even lamer promo ""Nellie The Elephant""...great for Oi! fans anyways though",1011312000,,651,4.612068965517241
