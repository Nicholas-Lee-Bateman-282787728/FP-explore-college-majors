She pays off Japan's national debt as an act of good faith and purchases an island just off the coast. She has decided to make the Bund the haven for the entire vampire race. There are many that do not agree with her intentions, including politicians and military powers. She does have many servants that protect her though. Akira is one of those. 1 year ago he had an accident that destroyed his memory. Mina apparently has a past relationship with him, an important relationship, a relationship that he doesn't remember. Now he is her new servant, and he needs to remember his past in order to know her true importance to him.

This series is excellent in many ways. The animation, soundtrack, story, voice acting, and characters are all awesome. The animation is bright, detailed and vibrant. The soundtrack is memorable and atmospheric. The story is pretty unique for a vampire story. There are many powerful characters, including lots of very sexy babes. It's a stacked series. I can't think of a single complaint to file against it.",1354838400,,1195,4.717703349282297
8456096,5,B00541P8V6,"This is a really good series if you like vampire vs beast story lines.

Also, this set is the original Japanese audio with English subtitles. That's a good thing because if you buy the US release with English dub they butchered the translations on those.

And I don't know if this comes with every order but mine had the soundtrack for the series on a CD as a bonus inside the DVD case.

The case is a nice hardpack with a colorful slip cover. Hopefully that's included with all of them and not just early orders.",1307059200,3,513,4.322916666666667
