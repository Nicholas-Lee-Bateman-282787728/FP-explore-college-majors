8187963,4,B000P0I4PI,"I would just like to point out this isn't just a review of just Vol. 3 but of the series in general. Gunbuster2 is a Super Robot Space Opera that later was the inspiration to Gurren Lagann. It plays up many of the stereotypical mecha elements in most anime and exaggerates it to the max, and it works! The Juxtaposition of the two heroines gives right amount of character development that breaks up the action. Fans of the original series will notice a lot of references from the first series and will not be disappointed.

The only reason why I have to give it a 4 out of 5 would be the that this brand only hold two episodes per disc. I must also point out that for the casual anime fan, be warned that the series (along with the original) was never domestically dubbed for English audiences so subtitles are a must.

Overall it's a must have for any hardcore Gainax fan.",1310169600,2,873,4.3496932515337425
