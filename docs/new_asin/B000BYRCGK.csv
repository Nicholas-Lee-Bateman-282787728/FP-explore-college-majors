2448740,5,B000BYRCGK,"The first one ""dora"" had my classroom of [...] engaging, laughing, repeating, answering Dora's questions simultaneously.  It was great.  I didn't feel like I had just hired an electronic babysitter.  I felt like I had just introduced spanish, a very creative story and it was only 20 minutes.  My own children are allowed to watch this DVD too because it is interactive and encourages participation throughout the DVD>",1229472000,,418,5.102941176470588

8094476,5,B000BYRCGK,"Ever since Nickelodeon stopped showing reruns of Lazytown (my son's favorite show), I have been looking for a way to get my son his ""fix"". I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but Lazytown DVDs are very expensive and not very easy to come by. This Nick Jr Favorites Volume 3 is a wonderful solution. Not only does it have an episode of Lazytown, but it also has Backyardigans, Dora, Max & Ruby, Little Bill, & Blues Clues (another favorite). I would definitely recommend.",1293494400,6,475,4.6
