7834876,4,6302989590,"As a film based on Margaret Landon's novelisation of Anna Leonowen's  book ""Anna and the King of Siam"" this is enjoyable film, both as a feel good story and as a visual spectacle.

I would recommend you buy the DVD rather than the VHS tape as the DVD contains a short documentary on the real life of Anna Leonowens and how her version of events were compiled. It reveals the areas of Anna's life that were embellished and those that she changed to make her story marketable to an American audience at the turn of the century - when women's issues were rising to the surface.

Unfortunately, some viewers may tend to look at the film's ""surface"" without challenging the film's historical innacuracies, the western view of Siam when Anna wrote her book and the western view of Thailand when the film was made. As a document showing western values ""towards the Orient"" it is most interesting. As a reflection of what was happening in Siam during the reign of King Mongkut it is next to worthless. Indeed it is understandable how this production continues to offend the Thai People.

Having said this, the lavish sets, the intricate costumes, the glorious post war acting and the period cinematography make the film a pleasure to watch... if you remember it is a long, long, long way from ""truth.""",1187049600,,1293,4.682819383259912
7834877,5,6302989590,"One of the best books I have ever read is Margaret Landon's true story of Anna Leonowens, who at the age of 33, went to Siam as a governess to tutor the king's children. A widow of incredible courage and talent, her story is moving as well adventurous, and this film is a marvelous adaptation of Anna's time in that strange and foreign land, with her small son to take care of.
Landon's book of course also inspired the terrific Rodgers and Hammerstein musical and the film starring Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, as well as the far less successful 1999 remake.
Rex Harrison, in his first film for an American studio is riveting as King Mongkut; it's a sensitive and insightful portrayal, with his beautiful voice and enunciation making the most of the intelligent script, and Irene Dunne is a strong and wonderful Anna. These were the days when Caucasian actors took the parts of Asians, and we have some excellent supporting parts taken by Lee J. Cobb as Prime Minister Kralahome, Linda Darnell as Tuptim, and Gale Sondergaard, who received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination as Lady Thiang.
Oscars were given for Best Art Direction, and to Leon Shamroy for his fabulous cinematography, and nominations were for score (Bernard Herrmann) and screenplay.
The excellence and charisma of its two stars and their chemistry together are great to watch, and anyone who likes Landon's book as much as I do will appreciate this film. Total running time is 128 minutes.",1087084800,18,1468,4.829365079365079
7834878,4,6302989590,"Anna and The King of Siam stars one of my favorite actresses. Irene Dunne has always been a star with tons of class and in this movie you can see why she was so popular in the 30s and 40s. The movie differs from the musical stage hit The King and I, but it is, nevertheless, very enjoyable. The sets, the photography and Rex Harrison as the King are all superb.",1083628800,5,361,4.098591549295775
7834879,5,6302989590,"I have seen this movie over and over again.  I love it.  I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD but decided not to wait any longer.  When I first saw it I was a bit surprised by Rex Harrison in the lead role, but after a few moments you begin to believe he is the King of Siam.  The cast is superb.....the movie is excellent.",1072828800,5,332,3.7681159420289854
7834880,4,6302989590,"Irene Dunne stars as a widowed single mother who is engaged to teach the numerous children of the King of Siam.  Rex Harrison stars as the King, a man trying to bring Siam into the modern world and to find respect for himself and his country on the world stage.  Ultimately, he comes to rely on Dunne for her support and guidance to achieve his goals, and there is an obvious feeling of attraction that develops between the two.  Dunne delivers yet another solid, emotional performance as the independent woman who must learn to adapt to a new culture.  Dunne was always such a pro, yet surprisingly is not as well known today as other actresses from her time.  Harrison strikes me as an odd choice for the role of the King, but he grew on me as the movie progressed, and although I think he's not the best choice, he nonetheless delivers a credible performance.  Gale Sondergaard, a favourite character actress of mine, is very good and quietly effective as the King's ignored first wife, looking out for the interests of her son, the heir.  I don't know how much of the story is really true, but it is entertaining and a good look at another time and place in history.  It's an excellent production, and even if you've seen the musical, I'm sure you'll enjoy this version, too.",982972800,7,1279,4.530434782608696
7834881,5,6302989590,"This is a fantastic movie with first class acting and a captivating plot.  Rex Harrison made his movie debut and does an outstanding job playing the King of Siam, who although respects and adheres to ancient traditions, always has his eye towards the future of his country and people.
Irene Dunne plays a teacher brought over from England to teach the Kings children (at least 50 children) the classics of literature, English, Math and History.  Though it starts at first her teaching the children, ultimately she becomes the student learning caring, compassion and genuine concern for the King, the children and the Siamese people she has learned to love.
This is a wonderful movie and has a plot that will keep you interested from beginning to end.  Highly recommended!",970963200,,771,4.961240310077519
7834882,4,6302989590,"Everything about this film is outstanding...The acting, the music, the sets, the costumes, the storyline, the dialogue, the pace, and practically everything else you can think of. It may appear to 'drag' at points, but  don't let that stop you. I for one think this is a great deal better than  the recent version with Jodie Foster, because this focuses mainly on 'Anna'  and 'The King of Siam'.  To start with, Irene Dunne excels as Anna Leon  Owens. She is just as charming as Deborah Kerr, perhaps even better, very  emotional, very moving, and knows exactly how she should be in every scene.  She is probably the one who steals the entire show. Rex Harrison also does  surprisingly well as the strong-willed King of Siam, considering the fact  that he wasn't even Asian. He is probably even more 'emotional' than Yul  Brynner, especially in the scene of his death. Lee J. Cobb well-suited the  role of the headstrong Kralahome, and Gale Sondergarrd was very convincing  as Lady Thaing, the neglected first wife. And last but not least is Linda  Darnell, as Tuptim, the King's favourite concubine. She is nothing like the  sweet, innocent, kind-hearted and loving Tuptim we find in THE KING AND I  and ANNA AND THE KING(with Jodie Foster et. al). Infact, she turns out to  be proud, haughty and vain, and Linda Darnell expresses all these  'qualities' very well, yet she manages to be really sympathetic during a  trial, where she is not judged fairly.  However, this version is much more  emotional than the other two, with really sad, heartbreaking incidents, and  many may not be able to cope with it. It will probably stay in your head  for a very long time. For instance, two characters who survive in THE KING  AND I, which is the closest version to this, die here(One is even burned at  the stake, and her final cries of terror can be heard). But all in all,  this is one of the best out of the many versions of ANNA AND THE KING, and  THE KING AND I would never have been created, if it hadn't been for this...",960768000,6,2021,4.591036414565826
7834883,3,6302989590,"Interesting, surprisingly lavish black-and-white filming of the same story which later became of the basis for the musical ""The King and I"".  Irene Dunne is, as always, warm and intelligent, and she looks charming in  ruffled hoopskirts.  Rex Harrison was an off-beat choice for the King, but  with his lean, upright bearing, he perhaps more strongly suggests an Asian  monarch than does Yul Brenner's swaggering, bare-chested bully in ""The  King and I"".  The secondary casting is strong, also, with Gale  Sonnergard particularly touching in the reserved role of the King's  neglected # 1 wife. And lavishly costumed Linda Darnell gets most of the  plot's histrionics to play out.  (She also has to tangle with a  scene-stealing monkey.)
This is the rare film that actually looks better  ""live"" than it does in still photographs, in which things appear  rather stilted.  The developing interplay between Dunne and Harrison is  intriguing, with its hint of romantic tension, but the film really does not  hang together as a drama very well, and toward the end it falls into the  conventions of the ""school-teacher-struggles- through-the-years""  genre which Hollywood often tackled (eg., ""Cheers for Miss  Bishop"", ""Good Morning Miss Dove"", et al).
It will be  interesting to compare this version with Jodie Foster's upcoming remake.  Recent scholarship has revealed the real-life Anna to have been something  of an adventuress who fudged her credentials and overstated her impact on  the King.  (The cleaned-up book upon which this film is based reads like  juvenile fiction, by the way. I've read it.)  Likewise, the real-life Thai  Monarch was a much more refined and forward-thinking leader than either of  the film versions thus far would lead a viewer to believe.",939945600,3,1767,5.210714285714285
