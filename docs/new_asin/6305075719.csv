7882225,4,6305075719,The old school videography far outshines this current barfy new school shake & bake cliche' crap tech.  This was one of the last to pre-date the masturbatory shaky hand-held camera crap.  So you may well enjoy this.  However the sexuality is so mild and bland.,1404950400,,260,4.733333333333333
7882226,4,6305075719,"A collection of Playmates from '90s strutting their stuff. It's a collection of videos from the Sexy Lingerie series which I never saw. So they're all new to me. But if you already have the series, I guess then these are like reruns. I think all the women are natural, since this is before the age of big strange-shaped breasts like current Playmates. Unless you like the old time Playmates, you probably won't enjoy this DVD. Since these Playmates aren't like the current ones.",1320451200,,478,4.7023809523809526
7882227,3,6305075719,"Playboy - The Best of Sexy Lingerie is fifty-six minutes and was released on DVD on October 15, 1997. The Best of Sexy Lingerie is fourteen segments made up of the first four volumes of the Sexy Lingerie series. Four are from volume one, six are from volume two, three are from volume three, and one is from volume four. When I originally wrote about the Sexy Lingerie series on the VHS videos, I gave Volume I my only five star rating. Volume II & IV got four stars and Volume III got three stars. Volume one was the only one that truly lived up to its title. Starting with Volume II and working it way to Volume IV, the word lingerie seems to have gotten lost. Below is the list of segments from the first four volumes.

Fantasy Express: Part I-Several ladies at a train station stripping down to their lingerie.
Glamour: Inspiration-A male artist is drawing a sketch of a woman in lingerie. In the fantasy, which is black and white, she is nude and they are both having sex.
Decent Exposure-Two ladies in the city strip down to their lingerie and then become topless.
Club Fantasy-A lady, wearing a tight red dress, dances with a male in a dance club. Some of the ladies in the club start dancing wearing lingerie or they are partially nude and dancing. The fantasy comes to and end and the lady in the tight red dress leaves the club.
Body Motion-Three ladies parading around in red, blue, and green lingerie. There are some nude shots, but are not that great and they look out of focus.
What Goes Up-A female security guard watches through a security camera as a man and a woman make out in an elevator. Both the lady in the elevator and the security guard strip down to their lingerie.
Fantasy Express: Part II-Two ladies in their train compartments strip down and take it all off.
Satin Doll- Pamela Anderson is in and out of lingerie.
Mannequins? -Two mannequins, wearing lingerie, come to life and put on a show for the guy who dressed them. When the show is over, the two ladies revert back to their mannequin forms.
Night Life: Auto Erotica-Two ladies undressing in the back of a car. They are either nude or wearing lingerie.
Members Only-Five ladies raid a Gentlemen's Only Club and put on a show. The lingerie is a joke and at time the ladies are nude.
Romance: Brief Encounter-Lame segment, what it was about, I don't know. Was the lady wearing lingerie-no. Did she strip-yes.
Fantasy: Sex Objects-Starts off with some bare chest guy chopping ice with and ax. It then switches over to a blonde stripping down and showing off her ugly black lingerie. Then the blonde becomes fully nude. At the end of the segment the clothes are back on the blonde.
Fantasy Express: Part III-Three ladies in the club car in a train are either fully nude or wearing lingerie.

Playboy - The Best of Sexy Lingerie is okay for its price. Not all of the ladies are mention in the end credits and only a handful of Playmates mentioned at all. I know there were some models and Playboy Cyber girls missing from the credits. Playboy - The Best of Sexy Lingerie gets a C+.

7882228,3,6305075719,"This video has a nice line-up but the clips are pretty boring overall.  Sexy Lingerie 4 & 5 is the best in the series with honorable mention to 3 for some fun clips in my opinion.

Day Dream - Shae Marks + Guy - would be better without the guy.
Picture Perfect - Tawni Cable, Tiffany Sloane, Wendy Hamilton - descent clip
Antique Lace - Julie Cialini, Maria Checa, Brunette - ok
Hotel Deuce - Carrie Westcott + Guy - again better without the guy.
En Vogue - Hamilton, Marks (bad hair), Tanya Beyer - ok clip but neat to see Tanya with jet black hair for a few brief moments.  To bad this is her only clip.  She was the main reason I wanted this one & it was hardly worth it.
Naughty & Nice - Sloane & Victoria Zdrok + 2 guys - Sloane had some nice moves.
Perfect Ensemble - Checa, Marks, Cialini - good girls, only ok clip
Well Suited - Cialini, Checa - probably most fun clip on video?
Victoria Secret - Zdrok, Brunette + guy - boring clip with annoying music.  Terrible way to end the video.",1279670400,,993,4.124352331606218
