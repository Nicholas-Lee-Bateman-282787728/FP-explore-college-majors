8510676,3,B0075XTZR4,"This is not a box set, it's only 1 dvd with 7 chapters.
they are 7 documentaries on Vietnam along the lines of
'Vietnam America's Conflict'.  The first of the 7 chapters
is also in that 4dvd set.  The other 6 are original to this
dvd.  Don't pay more than $10 for this.  The documentaries
are interesting enough and worth the purchase but it's a shame
it is advertised as a box set implying 7 dvds.  Amazon should
be more careful.",1438387200,,430,4.2592592592592595
