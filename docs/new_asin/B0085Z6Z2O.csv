5133946,5,B0085Z6Z2O,"Good comedy writing and acting does not lose its appeal through the ages...this DVD set proves that hands-down.  As soon as I hit play on the first DVD and heard the theme music to The Carol Burnett Show I was transported back in time to a place where stellar performances by a small, but loyal and lively troupe created good, clean, family-friendly entertainment.  ""They don't make TV like this anymore"" is what I kept thinking as I chuckled and guffawed my way through an exhilarating show and special features with the cast members.  When I saw the first musical finale I recalled a feeling of woe because it meant the show was over and I'd have to wait another whole week to see the ensemble again...but now I have the shows on DVD and can enjoy them whenever I want - no more waiting those lllooonnnggg seven days in order to be regaled again.  Amazon did a super job (as always) with good packaging, speedy delivery, and no-hassle ordering process.  Thanks, Amazon.

I give this set 5 stars and 2 ear tugs!  :)",1349481600,,1016,4.51912568306011
5133947,4,B0085Z6Z2O,"After she saw the hilarious take-off Burnett did of her (Golda), Hayworth called her to tell her how much she enjoyed it. Carol responded by enthusiastically inviting Rita to guest star on the show. Rita was delighted. Burnett's writers began creating skits and patter and songs and dances for this exciting show---and it was a memorable evening. The mystery is this: WHY was the original Rita-spoof show NEVER shown again and WHY was the Rita-live show ALSO shelved? I've seen very brief clips, but what's the deal here? AMTVPAS has both shows and are graciously willing to provide a private screening...",1349308800,,605,5.0
5133948,2,B0085Z6Z2O,"If you're deaf/hard of hearing, or you're thinking of getting this for someone who is, be aware that Time Life chose to ignore up to 40% of the likely demographic for this series and not provide Closed Captions.

*** = the DVDs
Don't get me wrong, these are GREAT EPISODES, but for those of us who bought the 31 disc set from Columbia House 10 years ago in 2002, we have them all.
It is disappointing that Carol Burnette & Time Life sprinkled some 10 new episodes in another 22-disc mega-set (NOT THIS 6 DVD SET) forcing us to re-buy most of what we already have, just to get 10 new episodes.  And I repeat, those 10 new episodes are NOT on this shorter 6 DVD set! You have to get the 22 Disc set.  I would quickly buy this set if it had the 10 new episodes.

To top off the insult, if you buy the new 22-disc set to get the 10 new episodes not previously available, you still have to look for the old 31 disc set from 2002 because 22 episodes from that set have been left off of the new 22-disc set.

If I sound cranky it is because I do not want to buy 15 discs of shows that I already have just to get 4 discs of new shows & 3 discs of bonus material. I would still have to keep the old set for the missing 22 episodes.

This 6-disc set is just for those casual fans who either have not bought the previous 2002 31 disc set from Columbia House, or do not want to buy the mega-22 disc set currently being offered from Time-Life. (Old Columbia House DVD disc numbers are in parentheses)

interview. Interview with Betty White & Carl Reiner. NEW TO DVD.

For the serious Carol Burnette Show fan, I strongly suggest you get the new Time-Life 22-disc Mega-Set instead of this Time-Life 6-disc set.
And you may want to look for some of the old Columbia House DVDs to fill in the missing shows: Discs #02, 09, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

It is odd that some of these new DVDs have up to 4 shows per disc while others have only 2 shows.

***2013 UPDATE  You may want to get these 7-disc & Bonus sets instead of the 6-disc & 22-disc sets, you will get 5 shows not on the 22-disc Mega-set:

5133950,5,B0085Z6Z2O,"This is a fantastic, comprehensive collection of the Carol Burnett Show. It's got all the heavy hitting sketches (As the Stomach Turns, The Oldest Man, etc) and it's so great to see her unique brand of wry, self-deprecating comedy again. There are some great bonus features, a must-have for anyone who grew up with the show (like I did) and missed those rolled-down panty hose! You won't be disappointed, it's hours and hours of hilarity, plus there are wonderful interviews with the likes of Carl Reiner and Betty White. It's great!",1348704000,19,533,4.868131868131868
5133951,5,B0085Z6Z2O,I got turned on to The Carol Burnett show by my parents in the late 70's - omg so funny!  We loved to watch the show and when everyone would do the skits and the actors started laughing during the scenes we would laugh even harder.  They really looked like they were having a good time which was infectious. This set is a bunch of shows that Carol picked herself and I am only up to the first two discs and I have to say they haven't disappointed!,1348704000,12,447,4.068181818181818
5133952,5,B0085Z6Z2O,"These are the same exact  quality than the previously way over priced official releases (2002) by Columbia house & guthy renker. I was very thrilled to learn that time life was releasing the Carol Burnett show at affordable prices,i along with many other fans could not afford the outrageous prices of the past releases. Time life did nothing to these episodes they simply re-released & repackaged them,but fans will not be disappointed especially with the price,unless you require captions which these DVDs do not have. I purchased the 22 dvds box set (released by time life on august 13,2012) which includes this 6 dvds of Carol's favorites (which has 16 full uncut episodes)and i was disappointed to see some episodes (10) were cut (in some of the 22 dvds 50 episodes) and found alot of dvd space not used or was wasted. Alot of that dvd unused data could have been used for more sketches from the series 11 seasons 278 episodes. But  fans must take what is available officially and these are reasonably priced compared to the ones released before. So enjoy the queen of comedy,the most gorgeous woman that ever lived-second runner up Rachel Welch.

WARNING: Be very careful from who & where you buy the Carol Burnett show dvds, many online crooks are selling cheap DEFECTIVE! bootleg/counterfeit dvds of this show, several on EBAY & IOFFER.",1348358400,16,1344,4.860262008733624
5133953,5,B0085Z6Z2O,"I grew up watching this show back in the 70's and it's as fresh today as it was then.  Time Life has out done themselves with these DVD's, making them available in stores and online at such a reasonable cost.  I own the ultimate DVD set, and can't believe how much content is on them. I must say I am impressed with the quality of the DVD's, especially with the older stuff and the sound is perfect.

I never get tired of watching Went with the Wind; ""I saw it in the window and I just couldn't resist"", and if you don't laugh at Tim and Harvey's dentist sketch you're not human!  Plus I really enjoyed seeing such a young Carol on The Gary Moore Show, one of the bonus perks.  It was fascinating seeing where Ms. Burnett got her start on TV.

So get your Christmas list ready because these DVD's will make a lot of people happy! And if you'd like to order the ultimate DVD collection just go to Time Life online.",1347408000,99,913,4.188571428571429

Everything you ever loved about Carol, Tim, Harvey, Vicki and Lyle is all there.  Great added features if you are fans of these guys, or skip it if you arent, there are still a ton of episodes.  Its no wonder they won so many Emmy awards, its just fantastic.

They make statements about life while adding their sense of comedic humor to lighten the awkward moods, fantastic!! The Carol Burnett Show has broken many rules and may be considered the original Saturday Night Live, but funnier! Get it now while it still is available, total treasure!",1437436800,,633,4.763636363636364

Unfortunately, the quality of the DVD was such that it could not be enjoyed due to the almost continuous blips in video and audio quality, including complete loss of data transfer, thus resulting in black screens.  I am shocked to see how those making this DVD collection did not use modern transfer technology so as to mitigate these quality problems.  Amazon graciously and without question has provided me with return labels and a refund.  The One-Star is for the quality of the DVD, but I give Amazon Six-Stars for superb customer service and, of course, Carol Burnett and her cast will always receive Thousands of Stars for the quality of their acting and the entertainment provided by their talent.

5134430,5,B0085Z6Z2O,"Years ago I watched this show on TV each week and was happily entertained and amused. Today I heard Carol on TCM. How nice it is she is still around and looks about the same. Except for the erratic SNL, TV today doesn't have these hour-long comedy/variety shows with all the sketch comedy. Some of the Burnett comedy was topical, satirizing commercials. Some of it is now classic - like the one satirizing GWTW. Carol & Tim Conway are both unique fantastic physical comics. Carol's eyes as Norma Desmond ..., Tim can send you into laughter with a few steps. The Bob Mackie costumes and Carol's opening greeting gowns were wonderful. The guests were great talents who seemed to be having a ball. Being able to slide in the disc and re-watch is wonderful.",1410998400,,753,4.626865671641791

5134445,2,B0085Z6Z2O,"Love Carol Burnett and had positive memories of the show from when I was a kid. Me and my girlfriend got this DVD and were very excited. But, in the end, it was not very funny. The production values of the singing numbers was awesome, but I was looking to laugh and the episodes selected were not very good. It would have been better if they had just taken the cream of the crop skits instead of whole shows. Even the Old Man skits with Tim Conway were just so so. And the skits drag on and on. I did laugh a little, but the show is dated. If you watch Sanford and Son or All in the Family from the same era you get more laughs, but this was dreadful if you are looking to giggle. If you like Broadway show musical numbers get these dvd's - they are chock full of them.",1408665600,,769,4.0

5134510,4,B0085Z6Z2O,"Having grown up watching Carol Burnett on Saturday nights, this was a real treat for us. It brings us the memories of a time when good, wholesome TV was around, and when Saturday nights were for families. (not anymore, hey?)

This is but one set of her 1967-1978 fabulous run of comedy, musical numbers, and sketches that kept us in stitches every week.
Mama's family, musical guest stars such as Jim Nabors, along with the rest of her cast of Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner are all part of this DVD. It would be nice to purchase the entire set over a period of time but for now, the price is good for just one set.

The only difficulty I see is that because her show had such a healthy run, to purchase the entire collection, bit by bit, would be rather pricey. Unless the opportunity presents itself to obtain the entire season, the individual prices can be a bit high so hopefully in time, groupings would be offered.

Not much more to say other than one good piece of the Carol Burnett collection. All of them are great and its just a matter of what or who you're looking to see.",1391040000,,1101,4.387254901960785

5134514,4,B0085Z6Z2O,"As a kid my mother let me stay up to watch this show.
It has good and classic humor that is still hilarious 30 years later.

This edition has several CDs with multiple shows that were favorites of the actors
who acted them out.

There are quick panel discussions among the cast members and then a transition to the TV show footage.

I sat and watched these over a Thanksgiving weekend and laughed throughout.

But, whether this is previously viewed comedy for you or not, these Carol Burnett episodes are classically great. The way Carol involved the studio crowd was always very endearing, and was a great way to make them feel like an actual part of the show. As for the actors themselves, well, I don't think there could have been a better mix of players. Everyone on their own was very good, and when put together, a great comedic formula was created. All these episodes were very funny and entertaining. Furthermore, this was very funny stuff without crossing into vulgarity and raunchiness. Very enjoyable.",1388534400,,698,4.825

Here's what I can't figure out.... the ads on TV showing segments of the product (Carol's Crack Ups) ARE IN CAPTION, but the product (DVDs) ARE NOT? Da! Does Time Life have what it takes to run a note on the TV ad screen .... ""These DVDs can not be enjoyed by the hearing impaired, sorry but we were too cheap to add captione to them.""
I found the same situation with the Dean Martin DVDs. I would think that most of the people who are of an age where they would love to purchase these DVDs, like myself, have a hearing problem.
Why doesn't Time Life get it. I'd purchase every DVD set they have if they were captioned. Perhaps the marketing people at Time Life weren't born when these great TV shows were current and they have good hearing. Too bad their heads are empty.

In the menu, there is a selection for Episodes, but all that does is give a description and does not allow you to play just that episode.  You have to select ""Watch all"" and then skip your way to the show you want.  Rather irritating, but if this is how I have to watch it, then so be it.  I don' thave 3-4 hours to sit & watch all of them at once....most people don't.

I would still reccomend this set if you don't care which episodes you get - which I don't.  I just wanted SOME at the very least.  The fact that ""Went With the Wind"" is included in this set was, for me, a bonus.  Laughed myself silly all over again.",1370044800,4,765,3.9220779220779223
5134608,4,B0085Z6Z2O,"Yes, this is a great collection!  I love those gorgeous Bob Mackey costumes!  Many of Carol's characters are very funny, especially Mrs. Wiggins, but Tim Conway steals almost every skit he's in.  He's a riot, especially when you realize he's trying to break up Harvey Korman and Carol by not sticking to the script after the first few lines!  His routine was to rehearse exactly as written and THEN change up everything before the live audience!  Carol was a GOOD SPORT for allowing him to do this!  Love the modern-day retrospective of the cast telling the ""behind-the-scenes"" scrambles.  The best show ever, of course, was ""Went With The Wind.""  I remember laughing 'til my sides hurt, having read the book AND seen the movie a few times.  There was such an awe about that movie, so the send-up was almost sacrilegious!  But I wish the LONG ten-minute laughter of the audience had been preserved as it really was, instead of being cut short on the DVD.  Harvey was fantastic as Rhett and Vicki was hysterical as Prissy.  Her slapping Carol at the end, saying Rhett Butler's line was a fantastic touch.  Kudos to Carol for allowing everyone to shine and for keeping the team together!  However, I could NOT and still cannot stand the ""family"" because they say horrible things to each other.  In the 70's, I'd switch the channel, back when we had to GET UP to change it.  Now, I just fast-forward through it, except when Tim Conway talks about the Siamese elephants.  Now, THAT was funny!  I also never like the charwoman.  Instead, I liked seeing Carol look her best, especially at the opening of the show when she took questions and had spontaneous and KIND answers for the audience.  Her Norma Desmond was a riot.  I guess my rating should be 4.5 stars.",1369872000,,1756,4.6547231270358305

It was also nice to have Carol commenting on backgroung info for the shows.  Her comedy has certainly stayed with her through the years!  This also contained an accompanying booklet that tells specific titles of all of the skits and music performances contained in each episode.

I was disappointed when she talked about funny parts of the show, then would show the show and the funny part wasn't in it. An example was the horse part of the show when she is singing. If they really wanted to make a great show, then take all of the best of the outtakes and splice them in the show that had the not so funny part. Then you would have had the best of in a show format that took the best of the live preshow and then the taped show into one show. The best parts are any time Conway and Korman get together. I think if they have a Conway and Korman best of or favorites I am diffently on board to purchase that, but I was a little disappointed in this purchase that Carol's favorite is more in the musical numbers.

So I bought this DVD as a gift to my husband and we started watching it... and turned it off after 1 hour. I am sorry to say that time wasn't kind.

The episodes that I have seen have a lot of filler time. The skits are actually kind of llame and even more adult in nature than I recalled seeing in my youth. Overall I'm not happy that I need to fast forward to keep my kids from watching Vicky's song about being a hooker in the first episode. That's just one example. Carol is crazy and Tim is still great.

I am a huge fan of Carol and her shows.

I assumed I would put in the first one and not want to stop watching until I got through all of them.  So far, not enough ""Tim"" and not enough funny skits.  Several serious ones and too much Roddy McDowell and Nancy Walker and apparent friends of Carol's.  Of course, this is labeled her favorites...just not a lot of mine.  Still enjoying it, but not like I thought I would.  I've got one more disc to watch and I hope the clips picked are funnier.
I'll do another review, once I get all the way through.

The discs have 2 or 3 partial shows on each one.  There could have been a lot more included, or at least the entire show.

It does show the opening where she takes questions from the audience. Those are very entertaining.  It's also nice to see all the beautiful gowns Bob Mackey created for her.

5134833,3,B0085Z6Z2O,"Although overall I am glad I bought this, I was a little dissapointed by the excessive musical numbers on any given episode.  I personally am not interested in a 20-minute segment on a salute to [insert any movie musical, movie company or theater company here].  I did a lot of skipping on this with the chapter stops for each segment.  Tim Conway was on maybe half of the 16 episodes so that was a letdown for me because it's always fun to see him & Harvey Korman together and I think thats the main reason people would want to buy this DVD or half dozen others they have confusingly put out(up to a 22 disc version..!).  And that's another thing:  With 6 DVDs they could have fit AT LEAST 4-5 more episodes because some of the discs only had 2 episodes which total about 100 minutes.  A DVD can hold at least twice that.  Any fan of the show be aware that there are A LOT of musical numbers and not a whole lot of Tim Conway.  There are a decent amount of Mrs. Whiggins sketches but only a few Oldest Man sketches and Mama's Family(but not with Tim Conway in the skit as Korman's hearing impaired buddy) and the next thing you see is a bunch of dancing and musical numbers taking half of the 50-minute episodes.  Boring(with the exception of The Jackson 5 and Steve Martin in seperate episodes).  Glad I bought it but again - could  have been much better with a little more effort from the powers that be.  At least they finally did an official release instead of buying 2 episode DVDs from a shopping channel like they've done for 10 years so that's a major improvement.",1351382400,32,1573,4.3493150684931505

But after further research on the TimeLife website, I realized an ENORMOUS number of the episodes were identical to those already released by Columbia House and Gunther-Renky(sp.)...very disappointing. I will not spend money on virtually duplicate DVDs merely for a chance to own a few new episodes and a sprinkling of bonus material. I can only hope TimeLife decides to release the DVDs individually so I can invest less money trying to collect episodes I do not already own.

""This set is very entertaining. It brings back to me fond memories of the Emmy Award winning show. It was rated as one of the best TV shows of all time, and I can see why. The actors were perfect in their roles. The sketches in which they performed, especially ""Mrs. Wiggins,"" ""The Dentist,"" ""Went with the Wind,"" ""A Clever Dress,"" ""The Family"" and ""No Frills Airline"" are my favorites. The Bonus Features video in this collections shares many interviews with the guest stars who appeared on the show. It's very interesting and informative.
Owners of this set will be afforded with many hours of quality entertainment. There hasn't been anything before or since with which to compare it!""",1349827200,15,850,4.673333333333333
