Our children laugh, sing, and TOTALLY relate to the characters.  From our 18 month old to our 9 year old, this show is a hit!  (Mom and dad LOVE it too.)
Beautifully animated, better than ANY children's video I've ever seen.  AMAZING music and songs, fun and full of life!  GREAT story that kids really understand.  AND natural, truly funny humor.  None of that ""cheap gag"" stuff.  The creators of this show and all who worked on it are obviously a talented bunch of people! Can't wait to see more!  Look out DISNEY!",1026000000,3,661,4.572649572649572
4007350,5,B000062UH9,"Ok, first of all, this is by far the BEST children's show I have ever seen, hands down.  The music is absolutely fantastic, the animation just was beyond words, the story was so natural, FUNNY and captured my children's attention like no other video!  In fact, I was just going to put it on for them, and couldn't walk away once it started!  I loved the adult humor and spoofs!!!  THe beach scene was just too hilarious!  We rewound it 3 times just to watch that!  I can't wait until the next one comes out and my kids go around the house all day singing the songs!  They all want Musicland Band toys, book, etc.  We're hooked!  I'd compare it to Veggie Tales at it's best, but in our family's opinion, it far surpasses the adorable Veggies in every way.  We still like the veggies, but WE LOVE THE MUSICLAND BAND!  Oh yeah, and there's no scary guys in it.... (my son's comment)
My daughter and her best friend are performing 2 of the songs in the school talent show!  so cute!",1020038400,4,978,4.313186813186813
4007351,5,B000062UH9,"This video is an exellent piece of work with imaginative characters, excellent storyline, fantastic animation and great music. I gave the video to my grandson and he won't stop singing!",1013558400,6,185,5.2
4007352,5,B000062UH9,"Wow, our whole family really enjoyed this video.  It's more like a mini movie.  The animation is looks more like Toy Story than Veggie Tales, and our family are HUGE fans of Veggie Tales, but now we have a new favorite!  The songs are so fun and the variety is refreshing.  We love the surf song and the broadway show pieces like ""Eddy Electric"".  My kids have been singing the songs since the first time we watched the show.  It's the only video they will all watch together. (ages 2-9) and they all love it equally!!!
We can't wait for more from the MusicLand Band!  It's great to see the cute instruments.  Gil, Eddy, Star, the Sticky Twins.  Our kids could relate immediately.  Great story and lesson too about friendship, forgiveness and we laughed and really would
recommend this to anyone who loves music, a great story, and QUALITY!!!!!",1013385600,3,844,4.604026845637584
8383258,5,B000062UH9,"I bought, ""We Stick Together Like Glue"" for my two grandsons.  They loved it almost as much as the seven adults that used them for an excuse to watch it did! The music alone is IPOD worthy. The artwork  that makes up the characters and set is pure eye candy! Without going into details just let me say that the plot has the perfect mix of both obviousness and subtlety when delivering the message.

I hope this is just the start of more to like it to come!",1114473600,,456,4.159090909090909
8383259,5,B000062UH9,"Now that the talking vegetables are history, it is time for someone else to step up to the plate (excuse the pun) and edutain your children. This is a cool, hip, very California style kids video that through a series of catchy ditties and excellent visual work infuse a positive message.",1074816000,,287,4.647058823529412
8383260,5,B000062UH9,"I didn't think I would like this. I usually don't like the videos my kids watch but watch with them anyway because they love me to.  This video caught my attention because I found myself laughing and tapping my feet along with them!  Great job to the creators of this show! The music is great and I am quite a music lover. Loved all the various styles.  Great storyline that kept my attention as well as my young ones, moved very fast.  The characters are great, as others have said, something for everyone, I like Eddy Electric myself.  My kids ask for this show everyday more than once, we had to limit their viewing.  It's been 2 months now and they still love it, we all do.  If you're sick of poor quality, dumbed down shows for your kids.... this is a show for you. A++++++",1055203200,,779,4.294520547945205
8383261,5,B000062UH9,"My children LOVE this video! They have all the Disney Videos, Rugrats, Veggie Tales, Dora, etc.  and by far this is their favorite! The music is as good as any Disney movie, even better. OUr whole family loves the characters and each of my children both boys and girls can identify with someone!  Buy this for your kids, you and they will not be dissapointed!  The animation is great, the story funny and easy for children to understand yet intelligent enough to appeal to mom & dad.  The humor is so funny as well, but not the typical ""now it's time to laugh"" type of writing. Very clever!  Also, a very nice moral lesson that will appeal to both religious and non religious families.  A GREAT SHOW!",1051574400,2,700,4.47244094488189
8383262,5,B000062UH9,"my kids LOVE this show and all the characters!  as a parent, it's great to see them into something that is so creative, fun and of such high quality.  i appreciate the wonderful music, attention to detail and the way this show doesn't talk ""down"" to kids!  my daughter showed it for her whole 3rd grade class and they asked to watch it over and we didn't get our video back for 2 weeks!
anyway, love it! highly recommended...... can't wait for more!  So creative!!! So much fun!",1041120000,,478,4.3977272727272725
8383263,4,B000062UH9,"This is a nice video with wonderful animation and music, but both my husband and I were very concerned with the religious overtones.  We wished there would of been some clue that ""Musicland Band"" had god references.  This video would of been better if it told children to believe in themselves and not to rely on someone else to get through their problems.",1032566400,3,356,4.634920634920635
8383264,5,B000062UH9,"I would HIGHLY recommend this to any parent who appreciates, QUALITY, CREATIVITY, SUBSTANCE & MOST OF ALL....... FUN!!! Our whole family really LOVED this show!  It has great songs that we were all singing in no time! It's funny with a really touching story.  I liked that it was clever and had a moral message that our kids could all relate to.  The message was, we're all special just the way we are, friends are a valuable treasure, it's important to say you're sorry to someone you've hurt and important to forgive someone that's hurt you.  Not rocket science to be sure, but GREAT life lessons for us all to remember.  The message was delivered simply through an engaging story with wonderful songs & adorably hip characters! Our children have watched this show every day since we got it, and sometimes more than once a day!",1031443200,2,829,4.6506849315068495
8383265,5,B000062UH9,"Bravo Touch Studios.  The MusicLand Band Rocks at our house!  Funny without being stupid & corny...  Great story, awesome music, looks better than all the kids stuff my kids have! It's a #1 hit in our family.  Boys love Gil & Eddy, and Mike is a hoot!  Girls want to be the Sticky Twins and Star!  My wife loves Jimmy & Maranda, I love the Drums!  Something for everyone.  Clever idea, not the same old thing!  Way to go, rock on!",1027123200,3,430,4.209876543209877
8383266,5,B000062UH9,"wow, do my kids love this show!  ever since they've watched it at a friends house they've been begging me to buy it for them! So I finally did!  They LOVE the songs, sing them all day long!  I have to admit, I love them too!  Love the different styles.  The animation on this show is really the best on any kids video that we own, (veggie tales, madeline, blues clues, etc.)  it's really spectacular.  My kids want to move to MusicLand and join the Band!  They each identify with the characters and each time they watch the show they all ""claim"" who they are in the show.  My daughters LOVE the Sticky Twins and always ""want to be them.""  I love that it's a great story and so easy for the kids to relate to, and filled with great songs, beautiful animation and great content.  Can't wait for more from the MusicLand band!",1026172800,3,822,4.2727272727272725
