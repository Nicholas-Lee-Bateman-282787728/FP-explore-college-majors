8724130,3,B011ECVTY8,"It is good to see this show after all these years.  The quality of transfer to DVD is not good & it was not in color.  The series was originally filmed in color.  Lastly, I was disappointed that the 2 episodes on Volume 1 did not contain any appearance by Miss Ann Sheridan who was the star & she did not appear with the last 4 episodes.  If you want nostalgia, its worth the price, if not...pass on it.",1466812800,6,403,4.063291139240507
