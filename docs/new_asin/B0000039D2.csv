7902336,5,B0000039D2,"SECRETS is another fabulous tele-movie, based on the bestseller by Danielle Steel (refer to my reviews for ZOYA, NO GREATER LOVE and VANISHED for more information).
SECRETS tells of the adventurous producer Mel Wexler (Christopher Plummer) who is launching a new TV soap entitled ""Manhattan"".  He has already scouted prospective actors and singles out formidable diva Sabina Quarles (Stephanie Beacham) for the lead role.
At first, Sabina balks at the idea of doing a television series, but she needs the money badly, for some mysterious reason that she will not divulge to Mel.  Mel also recruits the lovely daytime star Jane Adams (Linda Purl), handsome matinee idol Zach Taylor (Gary Collins) as well as fresh-faced newcomers Bill Warwick (Ben Browder) and Gaby Smith (Josie Bissett).
But, for all the high-drama that plays out on the fictional ""Manhattan"", there is much more going on behind the scenes; Jane is trying to cope as best she can with her abusive husband, Zach is battling a nasty blackmailer, Bill's drug-using wife turns up dead, and Gaby is discovered to be the daughter of a rich millionaire.
This is a truly delightful film, with some moments of fine comedy as well as touching romance.  SECRETS is a fantastic movie.",1058140800,2,1239,5.034146341463415
