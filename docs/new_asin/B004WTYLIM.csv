8445734,5,B004WTYLIM,"I'm already a big fan of Cha Seung Won. A great actor--Korean, British, American, or otherwise. ""Secret"" is a great film. Cha is so believable as the cop-husband doing everything he can to protect his wife whom he is afraid of murdering a ganster's brother. Don't stop the dvd when the credits start--there is a surprise that got even me. A must for anyone wanting a good ride.",1330300800,5,377,4.5588235294117645
