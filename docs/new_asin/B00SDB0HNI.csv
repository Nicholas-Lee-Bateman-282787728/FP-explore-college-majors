6980023,5,B00SDB0HNI,"Wonderful exploration of these beautiful birds and their ""super powers"" , including their extraordinary sight and hearing, and their uniquely silent (and therefore deadly) flight.  There's even an enlightening discussion on their ""kryptonite""...rain.  With a mix of footage of birds in the wild, as well as trained birds, this documentary delivers some incredible footage, especially of baby owls in the nest and details of hunting acrobatics.  It will be a cherished addition to my Nature library!",1424217600,14,498,5.526315789473684
6980024,5,B00SDB0HNI,"Owls at their best... This documentary is unlike any other wildlife documentary I have ever seen about owls since this is not a story of owls in the wild since it will be impossible to make such documentary at all. This is a story of a couple of kind human beings who love animals and are already parents to many birds in their sanctuary and decide to become parents to couple of owls that are truly beautiful birds with eyes out of this world. After few years of growing up, these parents bring in specialist and scientists to create certain conditions where they can do certain tests to find out the amazing powers of owls. Many of the findings were unknown to humans since none of the experiments was ever possible without the cooperation of the owls but now one can truly be amazed with the majestic powers of this specie unlike you have ever seen before. Other than the capability of turning their heads 170 degrees where any human would cut their arteries and veins, and the amazing design of owls head, a  WIDE, ROUND, BIG, FLAT angled to the center to a certain degree face which allows the slightest sound to travel to their covered ears, abling owls to catch pray few feet under packed snow without even owls seeing the prey in the first place. Owls with their amazing anatomy design are the biggest wing to body ratio bird specie in comparison to any other bird on this Blue Planet. Big wings allow owls to keep flying without much work of flapping their wings like any other bird which keeps them in the air without producing any sound, and I mean any sound at all which allows them to getting closer to the pray and catching the pray. This was so educational that I had to watch more than once about all the amazing powers of these beauties. A must see documentary. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1424044800,16,1799,4.484756097560975
