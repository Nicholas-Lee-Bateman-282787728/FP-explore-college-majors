6429738,5,B00KI27R4M,I am so glad to be getting all of these movies on DVD in nice and crisp quality. I don't think the price being asked is really that out of line. You get what you pay for. If you buy cheap you get cheap. I cannot wait for my pre-order of this collection to arrive. My mom and I are huge Perry Mason fans and bought all of the the television show boxed sets from Amazon as well as the previous two movie collections. The movie collections were not available around here and the television seasons were only available sporadically. I am thankful to have a place to get complete collections on our favorite shows from the past.,1406332800,14,623,4.288135593220339

6429757,4,B00KI27R4M,Not bad but on some of the DVDs they would freeze just a second. Other then that. Perry Mason great as always.,1410393600,,110,4.045454545454546
6429758,5,B00KI27R4M,"For the price I paid, I expect a good quality DVD and I was not disappointed. If you can get future movies at the pre-sale price, it's an even better deal. The Perry Mason TV movies and TV series on DVD from Amazon have cost a bundle, but to me, it's worth every penny! Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale together have a chemistry that can't be duplicated by any other acting teams.",1410220800,,377,4.25

6429763,4,B00KI27R4M,"All of the movies are fantastic as are all of Raymond Burr's Perry Mason movies, however ""The Case of The Silenced Singer"" the viewing was not great at all.  The picture was not clear, but grainy in a lot of the scenes.  For the price these dvd's cost, the picture should be very clear and some of them are not.  I have purchased the first 4 volumes.  I'm not sure if I will purchase anymore if the quality of the picture continues to deteriorate.

6429764,5,B00KI27R4M,I have always liked the Perry Mason series and they did a great job with all the movies.  My Mother always watched them - she is gone now and this reminds me of spending time with her and watching and enjoying time together.,1408838400,6,224,4.209302325581396
6429765,5,B00KI27R4M,Any of these movies is better than most on tv today.  I love PM.,1408752000,5,64,3.5714285714285716

6429767,2,B00KI27R4M,Why is there not a movie title listing on this volume?  I would like to know what 6 movies are included on the movie collection number (3) three please!!  Thank you to who-ever responds to this.,1407974400,4,194,4.361111111111111
6429768,5,B00KI27R4M,"Ah.....finally! Volume 3.  I've watched most, if not all the made-for-television movies the first time they aired or on a Perry Mason Marathon.  Now.....watching for scenes in the movies that weren't in the aired versions.  And quite a few of the movies DO have scenes not aired for whatever reason.  The Case of the Defiant Daughter is one in this group.  The scene that was edited out for television wasn't violent so I'll assume it was removed to fit the time frame.  Perry, Della and Ken did a good job of clearing their client as usual.  I was a bit disheartened at who the villain (murderer) was.  Won't tell you who done it.",1407628800,4,631,4.522123893805309
6429769,5,B00KI27R4M,"Over the past year or so I have incrementally purchased the entire nine seasons (271 episodes) of the ""Perry Mason"" TV series released by CBS Video. ""Perry Mason"" was one of my all-time favorite  shows. The writing was always top notch and the acting superb.  As you might expect I was thrilled in the late 1980's when NBC saw fit to bring Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale back to television to reprise their roles a few times each year in the expanded two-hour movie format. I have already purchased the ""Perry Mason Movie Collection Volume 1"" from Amazon and I have every intention of purchasing the other volumes in the series once the initial exorbitant price comes down to a more reasonable level.  In the meantime, I was able to borrow a copy of ""Perry Mason Movie Collection: Volume 3"" from a friend and I am here to tell you that in my humble opinion there is no drop-off in the quality of these six episodes. I particularly enjoyed the work of William R. Moses as PI Ken Malansky.  So when the price is right do not hesitate....you will not be disappointed.  Here is the list of the six titles presented in this edition:

""The Case of the Poisoned Pen""
""The Case of the Desperate Deception""
""The Case of the Silenced Singer""
""The Case of the Defiant Daughter""
""The Case of the Ruthless Reporter""
""The Case of the Maligned Mobster

As I indicated earlier I thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of these movies.  For me this was definitely ""must see"" TV back in the day. I am looking forward with great anticipation to the release of Volume 4.  Very highly recommended!",1407283200,27,1574,4.553191489361702

Volume 3 was, in my opinion, better than Volume 1, but the movies just aren't as good as the TV show was.  I watched all the movies on the DVD and enjoyed them, but I don't need to see them, again.",1504742400,,293,3.7868852459016393
