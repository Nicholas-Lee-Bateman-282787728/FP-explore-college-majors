8478549,2,B005LTDVN8,"It's not that hard to get past the premise of ""For Love of Amy"" (a dying man's African-American friend becomes the legal guardian of his (white) daughter, only to have the girl's birth mother unexpectedly show up to try to reclaim her daughter), no matter how unnatural and forced most of the setup is. What's harder to get past is the melodramatic script that reads more like a soap opera than a movie and the amateur quality of both the acting and directing. With the exception of the titular girl and Michael's lawyer, the entire cast turns in cliched performances delivered very close to monotone. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole project was an acting class exercise. The invasive soundtrack doesn't help a whole lot. Questionable music choices turn up in the weirdest places, and the director seems to view film music as a battering ram rather than a tool to that compliments and enhances the story. I had to force myself to stay with it through the end credits, and I'm not at all happy that I did.",1372636800,,1009,4.611111111111111
8478550,5,B005LTDVN8,"I really enjoyed this movie. This is what true friendship is all about, doing the right thing & honoring your promises.  All too often skin color & differences between each other come into play.  Skin color/religion/national origin/social class/economics/boy-girl etc.. should never be a factor, it's the heart & character of the person that counts!  The acting was good and directing by Ted Lange was great. I loved the bathroom scene, so cute and funny! Overall a wonderful movie, something the entire family should see.",1362614400,,522,5.190476190476191
8478551,3,B005LTDVN8,The product description made this movie sound way better than it really was. The intention was great but the delivery just didn't do it for me. I watched it all the way through hoping it would get better but never really got a hallmark moment!,1329004800,,243,4.4222222222222225
8478552,5,B005LTDVN8,This movie was a great find for the family! It touched on so many social issues without shoving them down your throat. The acting was superb and I believed their portrayals. I liked how so many diverse people had to come together to resolve an issue. Movie was strong on looking at your own moral values. I think every family should watch it together. Mine loved it.,1324339200,2,366,4.477611940298507
8478553,5,B005LTDVN8,"For Love of Amy is a very engaging movie on a lot of levels.  Although somewhat ""paced"" in the beginning... it's true poignancy is felt as it begins to take hold.  While one might assume, given the premise - a black man taking care of a white child - that the film would be heavy on racial stereotypes and messages, it is not.  In fact, the film has far more to due with the difficulties in making complex decisions. It  effectively wrestles with the often, grey areas of life.

The acting is great and direction by Ted Lange (former LOVE BOAT star) hits all the right notes.  FOR LOVE OF AMY is a thoroughly enjoyable, family film.  Definitely worth watching!!",1324339200,2,661,4.458333333333333
