7823564,5,6302270413,"Not a great movie, but a delightful movie. Probably not a classic either, but Charles Laughton! What a different role for him. The movie takes one into a world of innocence and even though it is black and white, you get the feeling you are there in the South Pacific with all the simple but wonderful people of Tahiti. Very entertaining.",1449705600,,337,4.540983606557377

7823566,5,6302270413,"This is a CLASSIC CHARLES LAUGHTON/JON HALL FLICK OF THE 1930 VINTAGE, understandably hard to locate and only available in VHS. This copy is difficult to find in the secondary market and much sought after by serious collectors of classic films.  I've been successful in having the VHS transferred to a DVD copy, however this also is very difficult to accomplish, due to copyright protections. For collectors who are fortunate enough to find this film and want to have it for many future viewings and who may have home conversion equipment, I strongly recommend accomplishing the conversion as soon as the VHS copy is acquired because of the rarity of the find for serious collectors. For those fortunate enough to find this VHS secondary market, it will be pricey and lucky enough to find a processor to convert to dvd, the minimal cost will be about $65.00 but this is an 83 yr old talky movie. Good luck",1376006400,2,905,4.727848101265823
7823567,5,6302270413,"This is an absolutely delightful film, wonderful story, excellent acting. I have no idea what the absurd comment above is about (1930's socialism? 1980's prosperity? Really? Does the Bush Depression make any difference?). Forget the ridiculous and irrelevant political allusions - it's just a feel-good piece of escapism set in the South Seas with fine actors and funny situations - you will enjoy it. To be honest, however, I don't think any film is worth $40 on VHS. They do play it on TCM sometimes.",1289174400,3,502,4.91764705882353
7823568,5,6302270413,"A great movie if you can get your hands on it. I wish I could watch it now but have lost my VHS copy.

Island life was never shown better.",1234224000,4,138,3.6
7823569,2,6302270413,"I had fond memories of the book and of the movie itself I had seen many years ago on TV.  In viewing it again, I wonder what I was thinking then for now it is more than a bit boring and its atmosphere of 1930s feel-good socialism is almost unbearable now that we have lived through the prosperity of the 1980s.

On top of that, the VHS sound is exceptionally poor.

Moral:  If a film is NOT available on DVD, it is probably that unpopular for a good reason.",1218240000,2,457,4.101123595505618
