6959455,5,B00S6MBEC2,Enjoyed the videos.  Now I am caught up for Season 2.,1428796800,4,53,3.8181818181818183
6959456,5,B00S6MBEC2,Love this series!  Highly recommend it!  I can't wait for many more episodes!,1428710400,6,77,4.846153846153846
6959457,5,B00S6MBEC2,"Good new show with lots of twists & turns. I love when the ""good guys & the bad guys"" hate each others guts and think they are so different from one another, but turn out to be only slightly different shades of 'grey' which is what happens here. Jason Momoa is great as the bad son, ex-con, returned home to stir up trouble and Martin Henderson no less compelling as the Cop who pursues him. I really liked the underlying tension/conflict between the Native American tribe battling the local community over long simmering issues as well. Only 6 episodes here in this first season DVD, but it left me wanting more after watching them so it was a 'hit' in my book.",1426982400,23,662,4.434426229508197

6959501,3,B00S6MBEC2,"Dark, broody, and boring.",1456963200,,25,5.5
6959502,5,B00S6MBEC2,"Jason Momoa is so hot and he can act!!!! Martin Henderson is amazing and super sexy....but it was really an all star cast with some amazing acting and story lines. Season 2 was even better. So upset and pissed they aren't doing another season. So many open questions, but I've still watched the two seasons three times already !",1456358400,,328,4.576271186440678

6959508,2,B00S6MBEC2,"Attractive actors, but no real plot, no deeply involving struggle. Feels like various petty issues in a small town being kicked down the ""road""--false movement, not character-driven in the deepest sense (like Breaking Bad, for ex.).",1445040000,2,232,5.472222222222222
6959519,5,B00S6MBEC2,Excellent quality and great drama.,1444953600,,34,6.0
6959520,5,B00S6MBEC2,LOVE the show and Jason Momoa! Many intricate story lines to remember and/or figure out as episodes play out in this and 2nd season. Nice to have the dvds too see what piece(s) I may have missed.,1444003200,2,195,4.297297297297297
6959521,5,B00S6MBEC2,"Watched the first 3 episodes and love it.  The cop is such a good guy and tries so hard to do right, but Jason Momoa is incredibly evil, but does it so sweetly (?) you don't know whether to hate him or love him.  I'll be getting season 2 when it comes out.",1442102400,,256,3.811320754716981

6959525,1,B00S6MBEC2,"I brought this not knowing that it had a digital code and it is unable to be played outside of United States, so it was a waste of money. I haven't been able to watch on my DVD player or my laptop.",1441152000,,197,3.7142857142857144

6959562,5,B00S6MBEC2,"I love this series because I am smitten with Jason Momoa.  That being said, does anyone know if this dvd set has the deleted scenes?  Is the series renewed for a third season?  And to all the fans, I think we should tell the producers to go for at least eight episodes a season,  so as to flesh out these great characters.  Just email Sundance for comments and news on the Red Road Series. I love this show.",1431820800,2,407,4.166666666666667
