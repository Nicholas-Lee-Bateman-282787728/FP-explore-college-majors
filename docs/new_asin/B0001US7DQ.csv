8173555,3,B0001US7DQ,"This offering contains 2 GBH early gigs : a 58' concert at The Ace in Brixton, and a 15' concert at Blackpool in '82 as a bonus.

Both are shot with just a frontal camcorder by Jettizound with not enough and mostly untimely closeups, most of which of singer Colin. It is funny that the box states that the footage is restored because if it has, it does not show in the least. This is a direct VHS from a battered old tape full of compression artifacts from bad mastering at a fixed pic ratio of 5.3 Mbps. The gig is fantastic and the sound is fair if you have a big sub and can crank it quite a lot.

Sound is LPCM and, if a tad muddled up at times (sound dropouts,dissapearing guitar and whatnot)  everything is clearly audible except maybe the vocals and the cymbals. The sound is raw but powerful and the dvd delivers its purpose of showcasing the early GBH sound and attitude in spades.

The bonus incomplete show would have nice to have had in its entirety because it has a nice, punchy mix with clearer vox, meatier guitar and a gorgeously audible bass guitar and drums; no need for the sub on this one !!

Be aware; if you are a casual fan this dvd is a coaster, and you will be way better off with their fantastic dvd from this century. If you, like me, are a die-hard fan of the band, this dvd is maybe a nice addition to your collection.",1254528000,,1347,4.185328185328185
