1907085,4,B0000AKCKI,"Nothing is going well in Bruce's life, so he starts blaming and denouncing God. So God issues a challenge to Bruce: Take my job and see if you can do better. Bruce starts out helping himself while ignoring others, and his quick fix causes chaos in the area of Buffalo, New York where he lives and influences with his God-given powers. The ending is cliched, and there is a major plot hole- Bruce's girlfriend seems oblivious to the fact that some things aren't quite right. It wasn't as funny as I would have liked, but it's still a worthwile movie to see.",1053734400,,556,4.46078431372549
1907086,3,B0000AKCKI,"First the good news.  There are laugh out loud moments in this film.  But, those funny moments occur despite a rigid, rather lame script that has a number of opportunities to go off on creative tangents, but chooses, instead, to stick with cliches and a warm, fuzzy, and uninspired ending.
This film is all about Jim Carrey, of course.  The rest of the cast is mere window dressing.  Jennifer Aniston is pleasant as a mild-mannered, and ultimately forgettable, love interest.  Morgan Freeman is a good choice to plan God, but he isn't given much to work with.  Most of the scenes are cliches after cliches.  Thankfully, Jim Carrey can make even a cliche work, and he does in a number of instances.  In the more dramatic moments, however, his performance grows thin, revealing the same insecurities and weaknesses that were evident in his earlier work, including The Mask (where he could not carry any of the dramatic interludes between the hilarious comedic pieces).  What happened to the Jim Carrey of The Truman Show?  Frankly, I suspect it's all about the director.  Tom Shadyac simply isn't a very good one.  This is, after all, the ""director"" who brought us drech like Patch Adams and Liar Liar.
And it is worth noting the surplussage of cliche scenes--including a dinner scene where the woman thinks that her date will propose, but he has no such thing in mind; the encounter with a gang, and exacting of revenge; etc.  There's also plenty of low brow humor, which has come to be Shadyac trademark.  Without Carrey to pull it off, much of it would fall flat.
So how does it all pan out?  For me, the laugh out loud scenes make it worth seeing.  It's been a while since Jim Carrey has let loose to get laughs, and, if you're a fan, that alone is worth it.",1053734400,,1760,4.592948717948718

1907088,3,B0000AKCKI,"Jim Carrey stars in Bruce Almighty, a comedy about an average man who's down on his luck and blames God for all of his problems. Bruce (Carrey) lives in a very nice apartment and has a very beautiful and loyal girlfriend played by the lovely (and she's getting lovelier) Jennifer Aniston. However as a news reporter, Bruce is treated with no respect and watches as his undeserving colleagues advance and get all the great positions he has always wanted.
Aside from work, Bruce runs into many problems in his daily life such as wrecking his car, getting mugged while trying to help a homeless man and having a dog that goes to bathroom on his carpet. After problems begin to stack on each other Bruce takes his frustration out on the man upstairs, calling him the mean bully holding the magnifying glass over all of the ants in the world. That's when Bruce meets up with God, played by Morgan Freeman, who gives Bruce his powers for 7 days to see what it's like being God Almighty. God tells him to do what he will with his powers, but he can't mess with free will.
This is when the movie begins for most people, Bruce has the powers of God and of course he goes on a wacky rampage of revenge and seeing what all his powers can do. This is when Carrey gets to shine. For me, this is where the movie ends. For years, ever since Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask and Dumb & Dumber graced our screens, Jim Carrey has desperately tried to top his performances and has failed every time. Bruce Almighty is no exception to the rule. Yet another film tailor made for Carrey to walk around, be silly and do what he does best.
In my opinion Carrey is best when he takes roles that weren't specifically made for him. From The Cable Guy, to Liar Liar to Me, Myself & Irene and now Bruce Almighty, Carrey has played the average joe down on his luck who ends up triumphing over his shortcomings in the most elaborate hijinks possible many many times. And while Carrey is no doubt a very funny man, it seems nothing he can do can ever compare to the days when he was starving to make it in Hollywood and ultimately made better choices in film roles.
I admit, a part of me did really enjoy Bruce Almighty, especially once I realized how predictable the formula was going to be. Aniston does a great job playing Grace, the strong, supportive girlfriend who deserves far better than the self involved Bruce. Aniston also out performs Carrey in every way imaginable showing something Carrey doesn't know much about, subtlety. Freeman does a fantastic job playing God. If I were to pick any celebrity to be God, it'd be him. Freeman has a way of melting your heart and soothing your worries all at the same time.
As for Carey, his acting skills come around toward the end when he realizes his selfish ways and decides he doesn't want to be God, but just a better man. I give this film 3 stars because it loses a star for Carrey trying way too hard as usual and another star for being way too predictable. Nothing happens in this movie that you can't guess 5 minutes into the film. But with fine performances from Aniston and Freeman, I'd say this film has been blessed.",1053648000,,3152,4.426850258175559
1907089,4,B0000AKCKI,"I expected a lot from the previews and the movie did NOT disappoint! I went to the movie on opening night with my wife and a few friends and we all left the movie smiling. The first 2/3rd's of the movie had us literally rolling in stitches and the last 1/3rd sent in the message that should be good for any religious or even non-religious person. It's typically a good Jim Carrey movie though he's had some stinkers. This is not one!
The only thing stopping me from a full five stars is that I reserve those for things I consider usually to be best in class. There were approximately 2 or 3 curse words and this disappointed me not so much because I'm all righteous, but this is a great flick that the whole family should see together and many parents do not want to expose their kids to profanity. While kept at a minimum, I didn't find it a smart use. This was not best in class (comedy) but it is certainly among the top.
I do not like giving story lines away as someone will likely do it as they always do. If you want the basic premise, see their Web site. Instead, I can only report that the acting was exceptional and the entire theatre was laughing extremely hard with many having to cough from laughing too hard! See it, it'll lighten your day/night and remind you of a few things that are important in life. This WILL be added to my DVD collection when it comes out!",1053648000,,1376,4.255725190839694
1907090,5,B0000AKCKI,"What a great movie.  I say this because this film was just down right funny and it's all what we know Jim Carrey for.  Yes, he's been able to show us what he's capable of from varying roles in The Cable Guy, The Truman Show..and other, but really, when we think Jim Carrey, we think laughter!
And this film is no exception.
A joy from beginning to end, Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, a news reporter with nothing going his away.  After enough complaining to God that he thinks God is rubbing his face in bad luck, Bruce gets to meet the guy himself, played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman.
Bruce is then vested with God's powers because God wants to teach Bruce a few things about life.  Bruce experiments with several things of which I won't share so as not to spoil the movie.  Lessons are learned and fun is certainly had with these powers.
There some very, very funny scenes here.  Some other wonderful acting played by Steve Correl from the Daily Show.  This guy is great and the perfect role for him is a competing newscaster.  I laughed out loud in many scenes in this movie!  Out loud!  I rarely do this at the theatre...not many films make me laugh this much!
Please, go watch it!  Jennifer Aniston gives another excellent performance and looks as beautiful as ever!  Oh, and stay around during the credits for the outtakes!
Good fun all around, a great flick!",1053648000,,1380,4.476
1907091,4,B0000AKCKI,"""Bruce Almighty"" exceeded my expectations in most respects. I am a hugh fan of Jim Carrey's and Jennifer Aniston's; however, I had somewhat low hopes for a broad comedy with a Memorial Day opening. What a great surprise!
The plot is relatively simple: Carrey plays a self-absorbed TV reporter in Buffalo who dreams of being an anchor. Aniston is ""Grace,"" his long suffering girlfriend. After Carrey gets fired and complains again and again to God, he ends up being summoned by the higher power himself (Morgan Freeman). The bottom line: if Carrey thinks he can do a better job being God, then he can have the position for a few weeks.
The movie follows the traditional storyline for such mass market flicks: at first Carrey puts his powers to self-serving purposes (e.g., Aniston's breasts become bigger) and then he realizes the more profound implications of being God. I won't ruin the rest of the movie.
Suffice to say, there are a lot of big, broad laugh-out-loud moments throughout the film. Carrey displays his magnificent gift for physical comedy. In a series of outtakes at the end of the movie, you realize just how hard some of those scenes are to perform.
This movie also has a ""deeper"" (though that might be too strong a word) message. Carrey and the audience realize that you can't give everyone everything they want for a number of reasons. And when you do one good thing for one person(Carrey pulls the moon up close for Aniston), then most likely someone else may be hurt (a tsunami hits Japan because of the change of position in the moon).
One criticism: in many ways, Aniston is wasted in this role. I am a huge Aniston fan. While she is excellent, she does not have a chance to display her own formidable comedic gifts. Plus, the movie doesn't exploit the opportunity to have two such gifted comedians, Carrey and Aniston, play off each other. Both can shade their performances with darker tones. Perhaps, they can work again in a smaller, more independent film.
I would recommend this film to people who enjoy big, broad comedies. It's a fun movie to go to with a date, family and/or friends. I wouldn't recommend it to people who don't like Jim Carrey-most likely, your opinion won't change. And if you're an Aniston fan, you may be disappointed. But overall, it's a lot of fun.",1053648000,,2300,4.709677419354839
1907092,5,B0000AKCKI,"I'd say I've seen at least half of Jim Carey's movies.  After seeing Almighty Bruce, I would have to call this my favorite of his.
Jim plays a local network newsman in Buffalo, New York.  One bad thing after another happens to him (gang attacked, missed out on a promotion, dog with a bladder the size of a swimming pool).  He snaps and goes on a verbal rampage against God.
God (played very well by Morgan Freeman) calls him out and gives him His power to see if he can do it any better.
After paying too much attention to his own needs and vengeance, he starts to realize it's a bigger job than he thought.
The movie doesn't dwell too much into the religious side of the storyline.  It's more of a ""knowing what a miracle really is"" and ""what free will means"" angle.
Jennifer Aniston plays Jim's very sexy girlfriend.  About the only thing that didn't make sense is how naive her character is by not reacting to the odd things that happen the way most of us would.  Example: (as seen in the commercial) opening the bathroom door to see their dog sitting on the toilet taking a dump and reading the newspaper.  Her facial expression is a bit too ""whatever.."".
Movie warnings: profanity, overdramatic orgasms, monkey probing, and Jim singing 'What If God Was One Of Us'.  :)
Worth the matinee and evening ticket prices.  Enjoy!",1053388800,35,1327,4.495833333333334

1907107,3,B0000AKCKI,"No you can't.
Yep Bruce is really down on his luck, and we are reminded of that old saying,"" never hit a man when he is down, Kick him it is easer.""

After assessing the situation he comes to the conclusion that his situation is the direct results of gross negligence on the part of his maker. He makes the monumental decision to express his thought. Naturally in the tradition of the ""Oh God"" movies, only this time Morgan Freeman is god, Bruce is challenged to see if he could do any better. This time instead of, ""Death takes a Holiday"" (1934), God takes his. Now that Bruce has a chance to be in charge. What changes will we see? Was Bruce's assessment of the situation correct or a tad jaded from the situation?

Of course this is a formula movie with the outcome determined before we start. Jim Carrey relies on his ""Carrey faces"" to carry the movie. These facial expressions were cute in ""Once Bitten"" (1985) but get a little long in the tooth by now. Jennifer Aniston, of ""Office Space"" (1999) fame, does an excellent supporting role.",1508716800,,1042,4.478947368421053

Forgot way much of the story and remembered a lot of the high-points and jokes.  Love how Hollywoodishly old-school this work is -- even the credits.  This one seems personally crafted with slap stick that actually had me laugh aloud -- that's rare.  Meanwhile the camera loved the faces, and the film was fast paced with a lot of story to get told.  Nice in many ways, but mostly excellent for its genre.  I'll watch again -- hoping to hold off doing so too soon, but once a year would not be too often.

7-20-17 4th viewing.....go figure.  I committed to watching it a bit too soon and had to follow through for reasons that are not to be told.  Meanwhile the film yet could wring a hee or a ha out of me with ease.  I laughed aloud again.  I got stingy eyes again.  I don't know why.

1907116,3,B0000AKCKI,"Review of Bruce Almighty
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Bruce Almighty had such a promising premise: a man, disillusioned with God, suddenly meets The Man is given his powers. Prayers come in to Bruce, and he has almighty power to do whatever he wants, which, since this is a comedy, includes adjusting his girlfriends breast size and destroying a co-workers career.

This movie marked the last Jim Carrey movie that most people saw in the theaters. After this came his dramatic turn in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the quirky, hard-to-market A Series of Unfortunate Events, and finally the less-than-stellar remake of Fun with Dick and Jane.  So, if you're an old-school Carrey fan and want to see his last hit, you can rent this one. It does have a few funny gags in it, but its easy and sad to tell hes on the decline.",1497225600,,831,4.601351351351352

It doesn't surprise me that he was the one asked to play God.  Jennifer Aniston is one of my favorite actresses and she had a good performance (imho).  It was much better than I thought it would be and it made my day.
Jim Carrey is just the opposite (in real life) of the character Bruce Nolan, so seeing this movie made it all the more funny.  While it an older movie, it still is worth watching.

1907154,4,B0000AKCKI,"This review may contain some mild spoilers:

I had to add my two cents because, after reading many comments about this film, I wanted to put an opinion out there that seemed more well-rounded. What I've encountered so far in the comments has been either blind praise or relentless hatred for this film. The haters, from what I could see, could be grouped into 3 categories: extremely conservative folks who seemed to believe they could use this film as a conduit for soul searching, egomaniacs who believe themselves so far up above others that they are willing to insult everyone with a differing opinion to their own, and Carrey haters.

Personally, I never liked Ace Ventura after I reached the age of 10. At that point, that movie stopped being funny to me. However, I see each role that Carrey plays as a new one. I'm not always trying to compare one to the other as most seem to want to do in the comments section. Carrey has a style. If you don't like his style of acting, you probably won't like many of his films. In my opinion, I think Carrey did a great job in this movie. I was smiling quite often.

The simplicity of this movie worked for me. This isn't something I'm going to watch in order to write a theology paper. This also isn't something I'm going to discuss in bible study, if I followed that religion. It's a movie meant to be watched with friends or family over some beer and popcorn for a few laughs or a cure to a bad day. If you're looking for something deeper than that, you may be in the wrong genre.

For those that gave this a 1 star rating because it isn't appropriate for the entire family, get your reading glasses and check out the rating. It's PG-13, not G. If you are honestly that concerned about what your kids are watching, you would be looking at the rating of a film before showing it to them. Giving a film 1 star because you couldn't read a label is unjust. The content of this film is indeed inappropriate for younger children. There is sexual humor and innuendo present and a few jokes that cross the border of what may be considered kid-safe.

Those who commented that Bruce was a selfish and unlikable character and thus gave the movie 1 star because it was about ""selfish people"" -- this was done on purpose. People are selfish and self-centered. At the risk of sounding like I'm preaching, I'm going to make the statement that people tend of think of themselves first in everything they do. It's human nature, even for those who follow religion no matter what flavor it is. This film was about getting past that. It was about looking up and opening our eyes to how our lives affect those around us. In the end, Bruce underwent dramatic change for the better. That was the entire point of the story.

In response to this film's plot being stupid/ridiculous/silly/shallow/etc. -- it's a comedy. That it had a plot at all is amazing, and I think it did a great job with what it had. The story followed many story and character archetypes we are all familiar with as readers: a hero who has lost his way and finds it again, mending broken love, discovering new truths, and many more. The themes present in this film are varied and overarching, though I do wish Freeman hadn't blatantly called kids choosing school over drugs and single moms a ""miracle"". It sounded like advertising for a non-profit venture and completely threw me out of immersion right away.

Pros to this film: Entertaining, amusing, feel-good kind of comedy with some love mixed in. I'm not Christian, yet I still enjoyed this movie and the message it sought to bring to its audience. Great acting all around.

Cons to this film: Some of Morgan Freeman's lines feel forced. He doesn't have enough chemistry with Carrey in my opinion (one is a bit too serious while the other is over the top and completely UN-serious). His voice would have worked without the suit, tie, and chastisement on blasphemy. As a writer, I struggled to get a grip on the god character he was trying to portray. Unfortunately, I had to give up and just roll with what was given. Not one of Freeman's star roles.",1470182400,,4101,4.517520215633423

1907186,4,B0000AKCKI,"Released in 2003, Bruce Almighty chronicles what happens when God (Morgan Freeman) gives His powers to a complaining news anchor (Jim Carrey) and takes a vacation. Jennifer Aniston plays Bruces girlfriend and Steve Carell his rival anchor; Catherine Bell and Lisa Ann Walter are also on hand.

In my opinion this is better than 1977s Oh God! because Morgan Freeman is superior in the role of the Almighty. Plus, how can you go wrong with Jim Carrey? While the movie starts off rather dull it perks up as soon as Bruce (Carrey) acquires Gods powers; and for a solid half hour there are loads of laughs. At the end of the second act, however, the movie sorta nosedives, but then recovers in the last act with some surprisingly moving and even inspiring material.

The movie runs 101 minutes and was shot in Buffalo, New York City, San Diego and the Los Angeles area.

1907202,5,B0000AKCKI,"Bruce Almighty is definitely one of those uplifting movies that gave me a feeling and determination to keep watching again (at least once every 1-2 months).  One of the reasons; Bruce Almighty stars Jim Carey as Bruce Nolan.  He enjoys his job as a television promoter but  wants to aim higher in his career. He ends up going through an initiation process of reinventing himself after an experience where he reacted with extreme shock (on national television)after he found out that his rival Evan Baxter (Steven Carrell)got the job he wanted and is sitting next to a coworker named Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell) who he slightly admires.  At the time Bruce Nolan was standing next to some type of cruise ship boat called Maid of the Mist  and out loud sarcastically confused one of the woman he was interviewing for someone who was on the Titanic and Katherine Hepburns mom (with a light-hearted and respectful comedic nod to Kate Winslet). Fortunately he has a caring and self-confident girlfriend named Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston) who works at Small Wonders Daycare.  Bruce Nolans life becomes radically changed after he spiritual surrenders to God and actually meets God (played by Morgan Freeman). God explains to him how things work which is really important as he makes sense of being able to do a Clint Eastwood impersonation, parting tomato soup in a diner, and walking on water.  There are numerous pop culture references in Bruce Almighty as well such as when the song Power by Snap plays in the movie as he is using his newfound powers, Never Gonna Give Ya Up by Barry White during a scene involving him and his girlfriend (including Right About Now by Fatboy Slim). There is even an appearance by Tony Bennett in Bruce Almighty where Bruce Nolan takes his girlfriend Grace Connelly to an upscale restaurant called the Blue Palm. There is even a moment of a Mark Twain themed chili cookoff.  Please know that I also understand that there were many other strong contributions from other actors/actresses in the Bruce Almighty as well as other pivotal pop culture references. I was just listing what my intuition was guiding me to write.",1444176000,,2152,4.876712328767123

On the plus side:  Morgan Freeman was his usual splendid self.  And the storyline touches on some uplifting spiritual themes without getting too pedantic or emotive. It was worth the two bucks for a cute two-hour amusement.",1414886400,,365,4.6875

1907279,5,B0000AKCKI,"This is one of my all time favorite movies! I'm not always a huge fan of Jim Carrey because I sometimes find his movie characters/voices and comedy to be so over that top that it's annoying, but I love him in this movie because it's the perfect blend of physical comedy, sarcasm, and heart. Jim Carey plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter frustrated with the fluff stories he gets sent to cover, like the world's largest cookie, and amuses himself by being funny in his comments on air, but is really upset that he's not taken seriously and always bypassed for his co-worker, Evan Baxter (Steve Carrel). His girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) loves him but is frustrated by his lack of seriousness about the future of their relationship and selfishness but tries to stand by him even when he gets fired for an angry on air outburst, but breaks up with him eventually. He feels like everything is crumbling around him and blames God (Morgan Freeman).

After an angry rant at God, he goes to an abandoned building where he meets God. God has filing cabinets of all the things everyone's done wrong (boy, I'd hate to see mine haha) and he gives a few examples of Bruce's failures. Morgan Freeman is perfect as God - he's witty but seeks to teach Bruce a lesson by saying ""If you think you can do better than me, go ahead."" Comedy ensues as Bruce abuses his power by embarrassing Evan on air and making his sex life better for example. Eventually Bruce gets back to work and covers crazy stories but he finds it means nothing without Grace and that after a few weeks with powers, he feels bombarded with the world's struggles and starts to see that being God isn't easy and that he needed to change so he could be better for himself and others. I love the heart and messages of the movie: being selfish leads to losing things you love, be careful what you wish for, you can't change someone's free will even if you are God, and take a moment to think of the needs/struggles of others and how you can help them instead of yourself. Bruce has a life changing experience that changes him for the better.

This movie is the perfect blend of funny and serious and has so many laugh out loud moments and a phenomenal cast - you won't be disappointed!",1407715200,3,2236,4.477941176470588

1907292,5,B0000AKCKI,"I love both BRUCE and EVAN in this ALMIGHTY series. I'm sure that God loves humor, and that he has enjoyed these movies, too, along with OH GOD and many other movies that let us see different views of the Almighty and of Heaven.

Can you imagine what you would do if God gave you his powers for a day? What if you could hear everyone's prayers? What would you hear? Now, watch these two funny movies and see how close you came to the hilarity that ensued when all of this happened to two very funny people.

These two movies do come in a two-pack, but I decided to get the two single title editions (for just a few dollars more) so that I'd have the extra features (though I'm finally learning that I can frequently find the extra features on YouTube).

In both movies, supposedly average people get the chance to become God. It starts out fun, but they eventually realize they need to get serious, and learn more about themselves, and about God, in the process, realizing how hard of a job God really has, while still having fun along the way.

The humorous situations are out of this world, and I enjoy watching them again and again. Now that I own these DVD's, I plan to watch them at least every year. I love when they make a connection with old movies, like the promise that Jimmy Stewart made to Donna Reed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-A-Wonderful-Life/dp/B001M432XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's A Wonderful Life</a>.

I would NOT want to watch this scene with my children no matter how old they were.  There was at least two other moments that were embarrassing as well, and a few sexual innuendos that weren't necessary.  NOT a family film, fine for hubby and me.

1907309,4,B0000AKCKI,"I have not seen every Jim Carrey movie but I believe that this was his best so far, although the public opinion seems to be that this was ""The Truman Story"". The movie is full of the unavoidable comical situations Carrey masters with his typical wit and timing, but depth and message are not second rate here, and Carrey manages to convey these very convincingly as well; he also is assisted excellently by his film partners, Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman.

""I am not satisfied with a mediocre life..."" ""God, why do you hate me??"" Pushing forty, unfulfilled and dissatisfied, an angry Bruce Nolan challenges God, who subsequently gives him the chance to make his job for a while. But it does not take long for Bruce to find out that even the power of God can do nothing against the human Free Will, and after a while he realizes that he does not want to mess with it either.

I was rather surprised reading that many faithful people disliked this movie: of course real life is different, it does not take a few weeks to make peace with yourself and God - it usually takes a lot of time and work. But the movie's key note to love yourself, your environment, the people around you and God hit me like a hymn on the perfection of Creation, so I really don't understand what even the most pious of person should have to criticize against it.

problems demands an explanation from God and ultimately meets the Man Himself, played by Morgan Freeman. God decides to take a vacation and let Bruce Nolan, the reporter, run things for a while just to see what He's up against.  Bruce soon gains a new understanding of life around him and realizes that this world and the people in it all have faults and are not here just to please or even frustrate him...or Him.

Really well done fantasy made with humor and enough realism to be sort of believable. In fact, most of the characters in this dramady are well drawn and well portrayed, even the weasely one is kind of likable in his way.

1907373,4,B0000AKCKI,"This is a very funny comedy with a bit of a serious side.

It features Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a local TV reporter in Buffalo, NY.  His life is going very poorly.  Although he is wanting the anchor job at the station, he is mainly given fluff pieces to do.  He wrecks his car and several other things go wrong.  Even his dog regularly relieves himself on the couch.  In the midst of this, he blames everyone else for his problems, including God.

Soon, he is given an invitation to see God (played by Morgan Freeman).  He is then given the Almighty's powers (to see if he can do better).  Although he has the authority, he does not have God's wisdom.

As most would do, Nolan ends up using this omnipotence for his own means, rather than helping others.  Not only is there a ton of humor, but there are some good insights that Nolan ends up gaining in the process.

Although I was a bit skeptical about this movie prior to watching it, this is really a good one.  viewers will spend a lot of time laughing.",1234051200,,1009,4.275132275132275

1907375,5,B0000AKCKI,"I remember when I first watched Bruce Almighty about 3 years ago and I absolutely hated it. The way people raved on about how funny it was just didn't fly with me at all, I labelled it one of Carreys worst films and vowed never to watch it again. Fast forward 3 years and I'm in a New York hotel room, forced to stay in thanks to the blistering cold, and what's on TV? Why Bruce Almighty, thanks for asking. I decide to cancel that vow and just watch it again for good measure to cement my previous hatred. I was wrong, there I said it, I... Was... Wrong. It's difficult to say yes, but upon seeing this for the second time, for some unknown reason I absolutely loved it and have wondered since why I hated it so.

Jim Carrey plays Bruce, a small time news reporter known and loved for his comedic and light hearted persona which is ironically holding him back in his career. Nothing ever seems to go right for Bruce and he's constantly complaining that God has forgotten about him and is dealing him the wrong hand. After a day in which his arch rival Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) steals Bruce's desired job as news anchor, he goes nuts and gets himself fired from the station. That night Bruce argues with his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) and leave the apartment leading to a crash. Upon getting out the car he gets a page with an address on it. The next day he visits the address and is confronted by a Janitor in the guise of Morgan Freeman. This janitor claims he is god and is going to take a break leaving Bruce in charge to see if he can do a better job. Over the course of the film, Bruce uses his newly obtained powers to get back at those who wronged him and fixes his life. He soon forgets, however, that he's now god so he must take care of everybodies wishes.

This film isn't the funniest in the world and seems to at times quite a religiously propagandist film. Although it doesn't point towards one particular religion, it's obviously a film promoting the existence of god and blind faith. It is that of a very emotional film more than anything and talks about love and loyalty to the one you love. It also puts out there the idea of creating your own destiny and not waiting for something to be given to you. Some of the scenes are quite ridiculous and you would have thought that a man with godly powers would have done more than give himself a flash car. Although the comedy isn't really that immediately in your face, when it does appear it certainly succeeds in giving you a wealthy chuckle. One scene in particular is when Bruce is back in his job and is behind the scenes during one of Evans news casts. Bruce uses his godly powers and has Evan mess up his entire delivery costing the man his job. The acting by Carell in this scene is hysterical and had me in tears of laughter, the awkward look on the face mixed with the silliness of his news delivery is perfect.

Jennifer Aniston also gives us an excellent performance and backs up my belief that the woman is a highly underrated actress long overdue of that one big movie. I'm sure it will come eventually, but for now we're just going to have to get the treat of her in the rare great roles. Jim Carrey and Steve Carell also play such great roles, with Jim obviously delivering some great acting once again. Morgan Freeman, I think it has to be said that it was a worthy choice for the role of God as Freeman becomes the first African American actor to play both the President of the USA and God himself. The actors and story blend together perfectly with it seeming that the roles were specifically written for the particular actors in mind.

An awesome film that even if you didn't enjoy it the first time, you certainly will the second time around.",1229212800,,3737,4.357245337159254

Bruce Almighty isn't awful it's just so sadly average and I guess one could say that summarizes the career of Jim Carrey as well. Jim Carrey is capable of a lot and yet no director seems able to rein him in (or perhaps it's that Carrey refuses). Furthermore, he needs to stop accepting flimsy screenplays that require him to rescue them with his manic comedic style. The philosophy worked in the first Ace Venture and The Mask and to a degree in Liar, Liar, but it has long since run out of gas.
The supporting cast including Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carrell are really wasted here save the oft-mentioned news broadcast scene where Carrell channels Carrey's vocal pyrotechnics to perfection. There doesn't seem to be much chemistry between Aniston and Carrey either and it's hard to feel anything for Bruce since he's a self-centered martyr who never really seems to get it save a near-death experience. If it takes getting run over by a truck to see how selfish you are when given the chance to play God for a while, then why should anyone feel sorry for you?
Most disappointing to me was the cheesy sermon delivered at the end. Honestly, who cares? I don't need the kind of schmaltzy morale provided. Things like this are best saved for book markers, bumper stickers, or The Family Circus.
Whether Jim Carrey's agent is not doing his job or Carrey simply refuses to take on a job that might call for him to check his stand-up/In Living Color shtick for some genuine depth remains to be determined. All I know is we need more of this kind of tepid fare about as much as Carrey needs a triple shot of espresso.",1216166400,,1827,4.6770186335403725

It wasn't as bad as the other 2, but it was not that good either. It was barely funny, there were only a couple of really decent sorta funny moments.
The story was bland and got very repetetive, very quickly. Jennifer Aniston's character was annoying and did nothing for the film. Jim Carrey sure looked like he was having fun though. His character, while interesting enough, still couldn't really save the movie. Morgan Freeman does a fine job, as usual in his small but important role.

The scene where he's trying to read the news yet Bruce is playing with him, was so funny, that I was crying with laughter in the theater.  I had only ever seen Steve Carell before that as Edgar in Watching Ellie, but I knew after that scene that he'd be a major star.
Jennifer Aniston was good as Bruce's girlfriend, and Morgan Freeman plays God really well.  Some of the comedy is a little tired and lacking, but there are truly some brilliant moments in the film.  As I mentioned before, Evan trying to read the news is my highlight, and I also like the discovery of Jimmy Hoffas 'resting place'.  There is a message in here about people improving their lives (regardless of what religion you are, this movie won't offend), and it was written well and performed well by everyone.

1907392,4,B0000AKCKI,"CARREY WOULD HAVE TO BE GOD TO MAKE SOME OF THESE PRANKS BELIEVABLE!

There are parts of this film, particularly in the beginning and then immediately after Bruce becomes Almighty, that are funny and fun beyond belief. But then, as we look around we see a lack of growth by the character [Bruce - Jim Carrey] at a point in the film where we'd expect him to 'get it' and have some kind of epiphany. The epiphany, when it does comes, comes in the form of devotion to the overlooked woman who has been praying for him all along, but it feels like it is too little too late.

Narcissism seems to dominate 'Bruce Almighty' and it comes without enough balance thus making Bruce appear to be what he really would be like if he were god; a vain, selfish, lazy, hateful and vengeful god. Hardly the improvement the Bruce seemed to be promising when it all began!

 MEDIOCRITY: A STATE OF MIND

Put simply, Bruce Nolan [Carrey] is dissatisfied with his life and feels it lacks meaning. ""Mediocre"" is the way Bruce described it. After complaining to god about everything he could think of that pertains to him and him alone, he gets to meet god and is endowed with god's powers so that he [Bruce] can set things right in his own way, presumably a better way.

The problem is that Bruce has the same character flaws that he had before he was god and thus uses his power for his own self-indulgences which are rather mean spirited and narcissistic. He creates his own news, gets even with bullies, turns on his girl friend, Grace, [Jennifer Aniston] and literally pulls the full moon closer for its romantic effect.

BUT . . . . . . . the effects that all of his actions have on others is almost universally harmful. Creating news by having a meteor strike near him while the camera was running did no one but Bruce any good. Even his lazy way of answering prayers but simply typing YES on his computer to all 3+ million of them had harmful effects. This is the point of the film where Bruce should have been starting to smarten up, but instead Bruce just indulged himself until he found that these shallow, petty self-indulgences were NOT improving his life or at least the way it felt to him. Still, Bruce never really demonstrated a change of attitudes while endowed with god's powers and never showed any real charity or caring toward others until Grace left him [except in deleted scenes].

MY TAKE ON 'BRUCE ALMIGHTY'

Well all of this would certainly be acceptible except that Jim Carrey seems to be asking us to take this film and its content completely seriously. 'Bruce Almighty' is at times very funny. My personal favorite scene, is Scene 11 on the DVD where Evan Baxter, [Steve Carell] spends two full minutes as a televised news anchor saying whatever Bruce felt like having the man that stole his job opportunity say and do, in order to demean and discredit him. This scene basically sums up the film, parts of it are hilarious but we are left in the second half looking for meaning that never really comes because Bruce's only real epiphany comes in the form of the loss of Grace, [Jennifer Aniston] who had cared for him rather unselfishly all along.

ABOUT GOD: MORGAN FREEMAN SHOWS RATHER THAN TELLS & DOES IT LIKE A GOD

Morgan Freeman as god was terrific and wonderfully understated. He seemed to portray the idea that less is more where god's intervention is concerned. He also displayed infinite patience with Bruce and managed to keep a kind of mystical persona in all of his appearances, but especially in his last, where we were introduced with the notion that all or part of this was a kind of dream or perhaps not. Freeman's powerful presence coupled with Carrey's frenetic energy made for the most intense scenes in the film.

DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:

OUT-TAKES, DELETED SCENES, & 'THE PROCESS OF JIM' FEATURETTE

*---> 'THE DELETED SCENES', I felt some of the deleted scenes should have been included in the film because they gave the impression that Bruce had more of an epiphany and was growing as a human being into someone we could have more empathy with. We did see Bruce doing thoughtful things for others in some of these scenes and I can't help wondering why they were cut -- except for the running time of the film!

*---> 'THE OUT-TAKES', nice to see once, but they are something we have grown rather familiar with around Jim Carrey. Nothing new here, but there are some funny things to see and will be especially appreciated by Carrey's fans.

*---> ''THE PROCESS OF JIM' FEATURETTE, interesting though short, Jim Carrey is obviously having some fun here.

CONCLUSION: A PROMISING CARREY VEHICLE WITH SOME 'REEL' HOOTS

'Bruce Almighty' is a must see for Jim Carrey fans, though not his best work. Carrey again tries to be taken at face value, as in 'The Truman Show', but that is a rather hard sell with the director of 'Liar Liar', and 'Ace Ventura Pet Detective' sterring the project. Still, the film has a wonderful theme, Carrey is always full of explosively energetic fun and he's got Morgan Freeman as god and Jennifer Aniston as Grace, to pray for him.",1192579200,,5483,4.607802874743326

1907398,4,B0000AKCKI,"Jim Carrey is Bruce, a reporter who wants to be an anchor.  No matter how hard he tries, things seem to conspire to get the better of him.  When an anchor position opens Bruce does what he can to secure the position.  But even that goes awry and Bruce complains that God himself is out to get him.  This of course leads to a meeting with God himself (Morgan Freeman).  God is tired of the complaints.  Since Bruce keeps saying he can do a better job, God gives him the change by giving his powers to him.

At first Bruce takes selfish advantage of his powers.  But soon he learns that there is more to being a god then just selfish pursuits.  He can hear the prayers of locals (God didn't want to give him too much to do too soon).  How does he handle it?  How does one gain the wisdom needed to wield absolute power?  Bruce has to figure it out and figure it out quickly before his selfish attitudes bring about complete chaos.  Does he manage to find the wisdom?  Does he just give up and call for help?  You will have to watch to find out.

I found this movie to have some very hilarious scenes.  These succeeded because of Evan played by Steve Carell and not because of Carrey (no wonder they gave him his own sequel).  Although often compared to Oh God!, this is a very different film.  This is not about finding faith, but about wisdom, learning and overcoming selfishness.  Carrey does a very good job and is supported by other strong performances (Steve Carell, Freeman, and Aniston to name a few).  For a good laugh with just the right amount of seriousness, this is a good movie to watch.  Check it out.",1183680000,,1613,4.306666666666667

The story is of a self absorbed news reporter. When things don't go as he wished, he falls into a theological temper tantrum and calls God out for the injustice he perceives to have been done. God answers the call and teaches the self absorbed idiot a lesson by granting him divine power over a limited area of New York.

At first this seems like a lot of fun but it soon becomes apparent that as he gets what he wants, he loses that which he most needs...the love of his long suffering girlfriend.

I would never call this a teaching tool but it does have a point and that point is amusingly put. It's a great job.",1182124800,,837,4.251572327044025
1907401,5,B0000AKCKI,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS

TITLE: Bruce Almighty

PREMIERED IN: 2003

RATED: PG-13

RUNNING TIME: 102 Minutes

STARRING: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carrel

PLOT: A TV news reporter named Bruce (Carrey) is tired of having a ""mediocre life"" and blames all of his problems on God. Needless to say, he suddenly meets God (Freeman) and is given Godlike powers. While Bruce starts to enjoy his newfound glory, his girlfriend Grace (Aniston) is worsening because he is still the same person that he has been: egotistical. 9/10

CHARACTERS/PERFORMANCES: Carrey and Aniston are typically brilliant as the troubled couple. Carrel, I believe, steals the show as the antagonist that every news reporter would love to hate. Freeman was absolutely stunning as the humanlike God. He made me feel good about being a Protestant. But let's not forget all the memorable moments of this film. Bruce secretly tormenting new anchorman Evan (Carrel) is memorably hilarious. I don't know how Carrel was able to pull it off. Bruce breaking down on the Maid of the Mist was almost gave me a heart attack! The way he yelled out the word ""eroding"" just made me so happy with laughter. 9/10

THE SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: The script was top-notch, with every scene elaborated very nicely. 10/10

DIRECTOR: Tom Shadyac proves that he is a good Christian by getting the point across perfectly. There is no hint of biased storytelling anywhere; it just tells about God and the miracles that we control. Shadyac makes the tension throughout the movie flawless as Bruce Nolan starts to tear away the entire Earth whenever he works his magic. He also makes sure that the comedy is never over-the-top, although the drama can be a bit melodramatic at a few points in the movie. All in all, Shadyac does a brilliant job here. 9/10

PACING: It's perfectly paced. Nuff said. 9/10

CINEMATOGRAPHY: It's all good. There are no flaws in lighting or coloring whatsoever. 9/10

SETS AND COSTUMES: It's all modern, so there's nothing special about it. God's suit, however, might symbolize either hope or comfort. 10/10

MUSIC: It sounds very nice, although it isn't anything special. The songs (by Mick Jagger, Joan Osbourne, and Fatboy Slim) seem to fit perfectly for this movie. 8/10

VISUAL EFFECTS: All the CGI effects look realistic and beautiful. The ""close-up"" of the moon might be the only exception, though. 10/10

DVD SPECIAL FEATURES: The deleted scenes and extra outtakes had me in stitches (not literally)! 9/10

CONCLUSION: This isn't your typical feel-good comedy, but it does have countless moments that will make you cheer. This is one of the finest comedies that I have seen.

1907403,4,B0000AKCKI,"Here is how I knew the movie was funny-- I went in thinking it would be funny; expecting it to be funny; hoping it would be funny and WANTING it to be funny. Turns out-- it WAS funny.

Jim Carrey stars as Bruce Nolan a human interest TV Reporter in Buffalo, NY at a crossroads. In a bit of life parallel maybe (wanting to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor while being wildly hilarious??), Nolan's high ratings and beautiful girlfriend Grace (well played by Jennifer Aniston), are not enough as feels he is due something bigger & better as he awaits a possible promotion to station anchor.

In a wildly funny, angry & poignant moment (we all have been there) Carrey's Nolan angrily lashes out at God -- and the Almighty (HILARIOUSLY portrayed by the ever-suave Morgan Freeman) responds, endowing Bruce with all of His divine powers. And from there, the movie just takes off with Carrey given free-license to be a comedically-selfish almighty.

Shenanigans at the station, romantic-goofing around with Grace & potty-training the dog, all lend to another fine outing from director Tom Shadyac who let Carrey run amok in Ace Ventura as well as Liar, Liar. Its a winner, and at only 1 hr 40 mins, leaves you wanting a bit more, which in this case, is a good thing.",1178064000,,1264,4.633928571428571
1907404,2,B0000AKCKI,"* sexual content: Bruce and Grace live together, but aren't married. It's obvious that sex is part of their relationship based on several sly comments and one ""encounter"": In preparation for sex, an all-powerful Bruce sheds his clothes (down to briefs) while Grace primps in the bathroom. Before she can join him, he divinely pleasures her from the other room (the audience watches as she is overcome with ecstasy). Passing a girl on the street, Bruce creates a gust that blows her dress up, revealing thong underwear. At a party, a co-worker makes a play for Bruce in the bedroom and is caught kissing him. A TV commercial advertises a CD containing the song ""Bruce So Horny."" Wisecracks also involve pornography and unconventional sex.

* violent content: Street thugs beat up Bruce and smash his car window. After being denied an apology, payback involves an animal emerging from the rectum of one of the hoods (implied) and then jumping back in. A swarm of bees attacks the other gang members. A sportscaster is knocked cold by a champagne cork. Bruce smashes his car into a pole. Later he gets hit by a truck. A chaotic uprising finds doomsday prophets and rioters clashing in the streets.

* crude or profane language: Several exclamatory uses of the Lord's name are joined by just over a dozen other profanities, including several s-words and uses of ""a--hole."" There's also one f-word. Bruce gives a pompous colleague a series of middle fingers in a creative manner just begging to be imitated by young viewers.

* drug and alcohol content: Bruce and Grace drink beer at home and wine at a restaurant. Bruce pours drinks at a party. To get even with a disrespectful reporter, Bruce miraculously fills the guy's news van with marijuana when police are present.

* other negative elements: Some bathroom gags and gross humor involve flatulence, a nose-picking baker and a dog that urinates on various home furnishings.

* conclusion: Aniston has been quoted as saying, ""It's hard to infuse spirituality in a bold commercial movie. There's always going to be some group that's going to have a problem with something if you're dealing with God, because if it's not their way, it's the wrong way."" To expect a presentation of the gospel in a Jim Carrey film is unrealistic. Even so, inspiring people to think about spirituality without implying a narrow path will leave many believing that any number of theological pursuits and behaviours are equally valid.",1174176000,,2461,4.90625
1907405,4,B0000AKCKI,"Bruce Almighty is a film that really does a good job at getting Jim Carrey back on track.  Some may disagree, but I personally thought that after Ace Ventura that his character roles within the family based pop culture shows were getting a little strange.  A great balancing act to his character is the fact that just about anyone can relate to the issues that are presented.  Another great thing about this film is Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman.  With a cast like this, you cannot go wrong unless the script is a mess.
It is great, and as Carrey's character Bruce soon gets what he wishes for so to speak, he only continues to lose focus of what is really important.  Bruce Almighty floats around the idea of someone else taking the job of ""God"" for a while, and does it with all of the candor, comedy and great acting it can muster.  Aniston is very genuine in the film as well, and gives the relationship part of the story more believeability.  Overall an enjoyable film that is one of Jim Carrey's better films in some time.",1173571200,2,1034,4.468085106382978
1907406,5,B0000AKCKI,"I've been a fan of comedy since the late sixties. Of the MANY top comedians, my favorites are Bill Cosby, Tim Conway, John Belushi, Curly of ""The Three Stooges"", Rodney Dangerfield, Robin Williams, and Chris Farley. Take for example, Rodney Dangerfield, ""My doctor wanted to do a thorough exam. He asked for a urine sample, a stool sample and a semen sample. So I left my underwear on the table and went home.""

With that said, I'm just not one to easily crack a smile when it comes to comedy, and it usually takes something very special to really get me going. Without knowing much at all about this movie or even who co-starred, I watched it for the first time on DVD today and simply lost it... a few times.

Selfishness: concerned excessively or exclusively with oneself, pleasure or well-being without regard for others.  Selflessness (noun) having no concern for self - only for others.  Stanley Williams in his book: The Moral Premise, brings this out so well.  ""Our thoughts are driven by our values, values come first, then thoughts, then actions"", said by Dr. Williams.  The Moral Premise and ""BruceAlmighty"" demonstrate this by written word and action in the film.  A look at ourself and understanding more about why we do things.",1167782400,,680,5.428571428571429

Their are some great parts in the movie like when he gets a monkey to crawl out of a guys butt, when he gets prayers, it saids ""You got prayers"" instead of ""you got mail"".

1907414,4,B0000AKCKI,"I first saw this movie  during Christmas of 2004. Then I saw it again a couple of days ago. That was a time when I was going through some troubling times and blamed GOd for everything. Bruce Almighty came in just the perfect time to teach me several lessons. BA does teach you a couple of lessons. It teaches you that GOd knows what is going on in our lives and everything happens for a reason. In the movie Bruce (Jimm Carrey)feels like the world is against him. He feels like a loser and that nothing is going right for him and hence blames God for his troubles. His girlfriend Grace(Jennifer Aniston) who is somewhat religious confronts him and tells him to trust God anyways and stop complaining. But her words fall in deaf ears. He somehow meets God where God endows him with all his powers and tells him to take charge of his job. Bruce like every selfish human being thinks only about himself. He becomes the I, Me, Myself kind of a guy. He uses his powers to manipulate people and circumstances but then he cannot affect anybodys free will which is the only thing God has given us as our own. Everytime he thinks of answering peoples prayers he does it half heartedly only for the heck of doing it. He doesnt really pay any heed to peoples needs. There are some real touching moments in the movie. Like the time Grace intercedes for Bruce and the time Bruce walks out on the highway all drenched up, crying out to God and saying I surrender to your will. All along Bruce had been a selfish human being but at the end he makes a selfless prayer to GOd for the one person that matters to him the most. The cast is good with Jim carrey, Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman. The movie is funny but with a little profanity. If you want to consider some soul searching the movie is a must see.

1907416,5,B0000AKCKI,"""Bruce Almighty"" is, without a doubt, Jim Carrey's best film to date! As Bruce Nolan, Carrey delivers yet another brilliantly-wacky performance, while also bringing some more to the role as a man who learns what it really means to be God. Morgan Freeman is actually very believable as God, giving Him both a mystique, as well as a sense of humor. And, even though I'm not the  biggest fan of Jennifer Aniston, she does a good job as Grace.

While the film is very funny, it is also very insightful. We question God's plans for us, but in the end, He knows the best for every single one of us. And even if we think we could do a better job than Him, think again. And finally, we should start thinking of others, instead of ourselves all the time. These are poignant messages, even today.

""Bruce Almighty"" is a very good film. It's a comedy, and so much more as well!

1907417,5,B0000AKCKI,"This movie is amazing!  While being funny and entertaining, it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening.  I will watch it again and again.

Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life.  He has a job and a life, but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness.  Bruce is bitter, unsatisfied, and resentful that his life isn't the way he envisions it should be.  As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life.  God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers.  Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted.  His life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy.....with one exception.  In the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him.  As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances,  but his perception of what was truly there.

This movie was inspirational and deep.  If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize.  As my wife says, ""Since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy?"" and my humble addition, ""May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out.""",1145491200,2,1374,4.333333333333333
1907418,4,B0000AKCKI,"What would you do if you felt that everything in life was against you?  That no matter what you did, it was never good enough for anyone or anything.  Would you persevere?  Just plain give up on trying?  Or would you lash out at God, after all when it seems the entire universe is against you, only one being could even possibly help you out of that kind of trouble.  If you chose the option of lashing out at God, which under some circumstances isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it's done in proper context and with respect for God.  By lashing out at God do you think that would solve your problems?  Do you think that God would snap his fingers and make your problems simply disappear or that maybe God would sort of take a vacation and give you His powers for a while to see if you could do His job better?  If you thought the answer about God giving you His powers was correct, then clearly you haven't been reading your Bible all that closely, but you have probably been watching or at least heard of the movie starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, ""Bruce Almighty"".

""Bruce Almighty"" is the story of a down-trodden news reporter, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), who believes that the entire world, nay the universe, is against him in all that he does.  Bruce's girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), tries to assure him that one of these days things will begin to turn around for him, but Bruce doesn't believe this to be true.  So after lashing out at God in anger, accusing Him of not doing His job properly, Bruce is given a life-changing opportunity.  A personal visit with God (Morgan Freeman), leaves Bruce endowed with all of God's powers, and God challenges Bruce to see if he can do a better job than the Almighty God can.

Truly one of Jim Carrey's most hilarious performances since ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"", this over-the-top, laugh until you hurt comedy will leave you wanting to go back to watch it time and time again.  ""Bruce Almighty"" may come off as blasphemous to some, though I'm a Christian and I found it to not be blasphemous, but that's my opinion and not everyone agrees with me.  Though this movie is truly hilarious, there are some deep issues regarding faith, and man's relationship with God that get explored here.  Even though I don't believe this movie was written by a devout Christian, it still manages to deal with issues of free will, the corruption of absolute power, surrendering to God's will, and God's love for mankind, in very real and engaging ways that can be taken to heart by any Christian.  I truly believe that Christians should watch this movie, but bear in mind that there are moments that may be offensive to some, and times that tread on borderline blasphemous, but in the end this film steers clear of that territory, and comes out on top.

I did say that I feel that Christians should watch this movie, but actually anyone who is looking for a movie that will have them laughing constantly should watch ""Bruce Almighty"".  I guarantee you will enjoy it.

1907421,3,B0000AKCKI,"Bruce Almighty has pretty much the same plot, style, and devices of The Mask, but it's not nearly as funny. In fact it seems to be an attempt to repackage that Carrey monomaniacal magic, but it mostly fails. Instead of the unlimited power of a mask, Carrey is given the power of God. I don't know if it was intended, but at times the story and the humor get bogged down by religious faith elements.

Carrey is funny, as usual, but the movie resorts to lowbrow humor, like when a monkey comes out of a man's butt. The closest they came to that in The Mask was when the dog urinated on a bad guy. It's unbelievable, but Carrey does nothing interesting or particularly funny with the power of God. He thinks only of petty revenge and being a news anchor for a TV station in Buffalo, New York. What? And the scenes with Jennifer Aniston praying for Carrey's ""happiness"" while she cried and wondered if she wanted to live anymore were NOT funny. If you want laughs and entertainment, Jim Carrey style, watch The Mask or Ace Ventura Pet Detective. This movie deserves to burn in, well, you know.",1133654400,,1089,4.445

Bruce Almighty is probably one of the best and most hilarious movies you will ever see. Jim Carrey plays Bruce in this wild movie. Bruce Almighty covers romance, comedy and much more!

The movie is about a man whose life is not worth living. One day Bruce gets fired from his job, jumped by a gang, and wrecks his car. All in one day! Then he meets God. God gives Bruce his powers for a while.

Here are some of the parts of the movie I like the most: when Bruce gets jumped by the gang and they scratch up his car, when he is in the cafe for a cup of coffee and uses his powers and the old man sitting in the chair gets freaked out! My last favorite funny part is when God said he was dead and Bruce got scared!

I want you to go and see Bruce Almighty for yourself, laugh as loud as you can, and have a good time! Bruce Almighty is probably one of the best and most hilarious movies you will ever see.",1129939200,,918,3.945945945945946
1907424,3,B0000AKCKI,"""Bruce Almighty"" is a one-joke movie that glides on the likeability of its star.  Jim Carrey proves once again that he is a very gifted performer of physical comedy, and Morgan Freeman is imposing as the Man Upstairs.

But the film suffers from a lack of imagination from its screenwriters.  There must be thousands of creative paths to take with a premise like this one, but the screenwriters barely scratch the surface of all the possibilities.  It felt like the first thoughts in the writers' heads went down onto the paper and then went onto the screen.

Also, the movie aims only for belly laughs and doesn't try to be an intelligent or thought-provoking film, like 1977's ""Oh, God!""

Even with all its weaknesses, I still enjoyed ""Bruce Almighty"" and laughed a lot.  Jim Carrey gives his audience exactly what it wants: a lot of mindless fun.",1129593600,,848,4.727891156462585
1907425,4,B0000AKCKI,"Being the religious woman that I am, I was afraid that this movie was going to be blasphemes and insulting. I was pleased that it took the role of God and prayer so seriously and still managed to be funny and heartwarming. I am very happy with this movie. Jim was hyserical (watch the part on the maid of the mist) and Jennifer was adorable (watch the  part where she is praying to forget him).",1129248000,,394,4.253333333333333
1907426,4,B0000AKCKI,"This movie had me doubled over with laughter at various points. It was one of the first movies in a long time that made me laugh hard. But more importantly for me was that it was a mainstream commercial blockbuster talking about God and spiritual principles. I'm not a religious person, but a spiritual one, and I felt like this film walked the line of being spiritual/inspiring without become religious/preachy.

Typically, I would render a harsh critique on a film that is as on-the-nose as this one. Unlike the classic GROUNDHOG DAY, which is a deeply spiritual metaphor and yet never really 'talks' about it...Bruce Almighty spells all the lessons out. But for various reasons, it still works -- and works quite well.

I believe one of the reasons for this is because the story structure is so solid. It doesn't really break any new ground, but it's clean and effective nonetheless. I think it also works because Jim Carrey commits so completely to it, and has us laughing so much, that we don't even notice we're being hit over the head pretty hard with the 'message.'

As a script consultant, script doctor, and screenwriter (...), I can easily be very critical of a project, seeing all of its flaws. With Bruce Almight, the ride for fast-paced and fun enough that I could just be a movie-goer again.",1127174400,,1306,4.719298245614035
1907427,4,B0000AKCKI,"First things first. It boggles me that certain reviewers manage to buckle and heave about the theme of a man assigned divine powers. Last time I checked this was a goofball comedy, with Jim Carrey for God's sake (pun unintended), so it's unclear where the issue comes from. I cannot be any more certain than these nice folks, but I suspect our dear Supreme Being sports a better sense of humor than to consider some innocuous comedy at his expense a sacrilege.

On to the film. It's a funny little farce for what it is, rich on computer graphics and creative gags that are by and large well done. Nice to see Jim Carrey return to his customary high jinks, the kind that exalted Liar Liar or Dumb & Dumber to their cult status. Freeman makes for an interesting choice to play Him, his demeanor in what little screen time he's accorded has the kind of savoir faire one would expect from the role. Jennifer Aniston settles for the girlfriend bit - messing around with toddlers, obsessesing over photo albums, generally reacting to Bruce's zany stunts, but I'd say she plays it with enough conviction to make us feel her personal crises when they come about.

It's clearly a Jim Carrey vehicle but for all its light heartedness I think there's a discrete point about three-fourths into the film where the story gets chick-flick sappy. It could have evolved in several ways, for instance with Bruce employing his powers to get at loggerheads with the real God and such, but the film takes the mainstream road - it does everything it might be ""supposed"" to do.

I found it ordinary on my first viewing but having seen it again I think it plays well as a campy summer comedy -- some hearty laughs, couple of good characters, and an agreeable day 'at the movies'. What more can you ask for?",1125964800,,1782,4.5625
1907428,5,B0000AKCKI,"When the film came out, there were several religious groups which expressed concern and outrage about the portrayal of God in the movie. Well, if you don't like Jim Carrey or if you're determined to be offended, you won't like the movie. Otherwise Morgan Freeman plays a very tasteful version of the Supreme Being who is determined to teach one of his creatures a number of important lessons, namely (1) accept who you are, (2) you can't mess with free will even if you are God and (3) you can't do a better job than God, or, divine omnipotence also requires divine wisdom to work properly.

My favorite scene is the monkey scene which is gross and absurd so it appeals to my Monty Python side. A lot of the other humor is very special-effects oriented and, as in most Jim Carrey movies is completely over-the-top.

The message that stood out most to me is that God can do practically anything except force a creature to love Him which is, of course, the definition of salvation in a Judeo-Christian landscape. To see the movie as potentially heretical is to miss the point that the film isn't really a theological textbook.",1124668800,3,1124,4.615

So God played exceptionally well by Morgan Freeman gives his powers to Bruce for one week to make a point. He gives them to him to see how good a God he would be. And of course, Bruce realizes that it's no piece of cake. The movie is so absolutely hilarious because of Jim Carrey. He once again has proven himself as a really talented and funny comedian. The movie also though has a good moral at the end. But, believe me, this is just hilarious. Bruce makes his dog pee in the toilet and then puts everyone's prayers in his e-mail box. (Yahweh instead of Yahoo)

1907431,3,B0000AKCKI,"This innocuous film starring Jim Carrey is familiar comedic territory:  a man who doesn't appreciate what he has is given a unique means of insight.  Bruce (Carrey) is a Buffalo, New York television reporter assigned to cover all the fluff pieces despite his ambition of making it big as an anchorman.  While he loves his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Anniston), he fails to take their relationship seriously, instead concentrating on himself and his career goals.  He blames God, and not himself, for everything that has gone wrong in his life.  After an on-air breakdown, he applies for a job and instead finds himself meeting God in the kindly, sly form of Morgan Freeman.  God decides he will go on vacation and leave Bruce in charge since Bruce already believes he can do a better job.  Of course, we all know that Bruce cannot possibly have the necessary wisdom and heart, and what follows is predictable in general, humorous in the specifics.

The humor in this film is not as wild nor as irreverent as Carrey's movies often are.  As a result, when Carrey tries to break loose with his familiar over-the-top style, it is jarring.  Still, there are some good, if not memorable, moments:  when Bruce discovers his new powers, when he uses them to subvert the success of his rival (a hilarious performance by Steven Carell), when he hits upon a method to organize the millions of prayers coming in.  The real problem of the script is that Bruce uses his powers for selfish means and yet never comes to that realization.  His job as God never seems to get in his way, and the trouble he causes is always in the background instead of creating obstacles his character must surmount.  As a result, Bruce's ""growth"" is predictable and shallow.  He might as well been given superpowers from the X-men instead of God.  Despite this, the pacing ensures that the viewer is swept along with the action, laughing at Bruce's antics while knowing all along what will happen.

""Bruce Almighty"" delivers a few good laughs and a feel-good, unchallenging ending--exactly the type of entertainment one might want after a long day  I suggest renting instead of buying since its comedy fades as soon as the screen darkens.",1119225600,5,2203,4.798408488063661
1907432,4,B0000AKCKI,"I saw Bruce Almighty when it was in the Movie theatres.  It was such a great movie.  The story line was great, the humor was great, and the actors Jennifer Aniston and Jim Carrey were great.

Jim Carrey's character is a news reporter who feels his life is going nowhere.  Every time something happens he curses God.  One day God gives Jim Carrey his powers and tells him to make the world better in twenty four hours.  At first he takes his powers for granted but eventually learns that he has to help people.  He realizes how God has this job to help others who are more needy.  Getting Gods powers becomes a turning point which makes him realize his inner feelings. He learns more about life and is able to communicate and understand his girl friends Jennifer Ansiton better.

Just when you think Jim Carrey won't be able to top his other movies he does.  This is one family film that will have everyone cracking up.  There is not just the humor but the relationship between Jim and Jenn's characters that is so believable.  This movie is both funny and has a great story behind it all.",1118793600,2,1088,4.4393939393939394

I think it is uplifting and light-hearted, the kind of movie that puts you in a good mood after watching it. To make a long story short Bruce is unhappy in his life and blames God for ignoring him. After Bruce challenges him, God gives Bruce all of his powers to do what he wills. You can pretty much imagine where it goes from there. It is a great story of how the grass is not always greener on the other side and instead of always looking up all you have to do is look within. Oh, and lets not forget all the laughs.",1114300800,,787,4.077419354838709
1907434,4,B0000AKCKI,"Personally, Bruce Almighty is my favorite Jim Carrey comedy ever. It's never outlandish in its approach, and at times, it's quite serious and adult. Carrey plays the role of Bruce Nolan, a local television reporter always assigned to cover the less than thrilling events in and around his town. Dreaming of one day attaining the anchor's chair, he works hard to shed his funny guy image.

Bruce lives with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but the two get into a fight when Bruce (who finds out he lost his bid for anchorman to the underhanded Evan Baxter) flies off the handle and loses his job. Unhappy with his life, and constantly blaming God for it, Bruce is mad at the world. In the interim, he continues to receive numerous pages from an unknown phone number. When he calls the number, he's offered an interview for the job of his life. Curious, Bruce attends the interview in an all-white building where he's confronted by a mysterious janitor who turns out to be God (Morgan Freeman).

God confronts Bruce with all the complaints he's made, and then he makes a surprising offer. God is going to let Bruce take his job for two weeks. God will go on vacation, and Bruce will be granted all of God's powers. The result is absolutely hilarious. Bruce begins by parting his tomato soup and proclaiming himself Bruce Almighty! He then succeeds in being the only reporter in town to happen upon the biggest story of the year - the uncovering of Jimmy Hoffa's body. Inserting himself into amazing story after amazing story, Bruce quickly gets his old job back and climbs the ranks of the newsroom. After sabotaging co-worker Evan's career, Bruce is even given the anchor position.

But along the way, his relationship with Grace starts falling apart, and the world around him edges closer to anarchy as the powers of God become too much for Bruce to handle. Desperate, Bruce experiences near death and meets with God once again. Acknowledging the difficulty of God's job, Bruce prays for Grace to be happy. God grants his wish, and Bruce is revived - brought to life with a new, fresh perspective to live happily ever after with Grace by his side...

Some of the scenes in this film are beyond description, they're so funny. Bruce Almighty is more than just a comedy, it interacts with the audience by making them imagine themselves in Bruce's shoes. A wonderful and intriguing idea for a story, Jim Carrey brings this film to life and entertains his audience in a way that only God himself could rival...

The DVD Report",1113782400,,2538,4.733031674208145
1907435,5,B0000AKCKI,"The Bonus Post it notes I got with the DVD  was kind of cool.

Very neat to get one of the Walmart Associates ""Buttons"" advertising the film as well.

I am getting to the point with some films  in my opinion, that you either get it, or you don't. It's like trying to explain a joke if someone misses the gag.

Jim Carrey delivers with an excellent cast. The standout is of course Morgan Freeman as ""God"". Humour, seriousness, and power, all together, just like Freeman did in HARD RAIN.

So what if the plot is a rehash.

The point here is that it is Jim Carrey  doing the Schtick, and  it obviously has worked, since the film enjoyed decent box-office, and seems to be selling well on DVD and etc.

For my money, the visual gags like the post it sequence, are just hilarious. And the extras show how Carey's work happens... it is spontaneous... I think the out-takes show that, and the deleted  scenes show plenty about how the film was put together. The commentary is more of a how Jim's chemistry functions sort of thing. Almost like the way some directors have used Robin Williams was unscripted in some films, and basically asked to just ""Let Loose"". However, both Carrey and Williams  have done totally  scripted work, and whilst Williams is the superior actor at this stage of the game, Carrey is still in the race, and will probably  continue to produce excellent work ( although, I am inclined to think he will not top Williams, especially after seeing JACOB THE LIAR), however, Jim is as Jim does, and he does it so VERY  well.

1907446,5,B0000AKCKI,"Jim Carrey is the funniest guy in Hollywood. He has all the traits a funnyman needs. He established himself as the big guy in the mid nineties with hits like Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, and Liar Liar. Bruce Almighty is another movie he can add to his list of classic comedies.

Bruce Nolan(Carrey) is a struggling news reporter. He hates and likes his job all at the same time. He is working hard to get a promotion to anchor but ends up losing it to rival Evan Baxter(Carell). That drives him over the top and he goes nuts. His girlfriend that he lives with Grace(Aniston) tries to calm him down, but it's all lost. He goes nuts and ends up geting what he wishes for.

He ends up meeting the man he blames for all his problems God(Freeman). They talk about Bruce and how his life is going and Bruce still blames God for his problems. God being the wise and omnipotent that he is gives Bruce the chance to do better and gives him his powers and tells him to run the Buffalo area better.

Bruce now has the power and goes wild using it to better himself. The better he helps himself the more he hurts the others around him. He is driving Grace further away from him and Buffalo is going nuts because there prayers aren't being answered right. Bruce learns you can't force everything or make it go your way and now he must correct things before it's to late.

Jim Carrey is vintage Carrey in this movie. It reunited him with Tom Shadyac who directed Carrey's previous hits Ace Ventura and Liar Liar. It's fun watching Carrey go back to his old slap stick sarcastic ways. The movie really works because he takes the role and runs with it. We all know Jim Carrey is god and we finally get to see him play it. He's not offensive with the part either, and I don't think any religous person could be offended by it, especially with the happy feel good ending.

The rest of the actors are there as filling. Aniston was put on the project to add another big name to attract a couple of more people to the seats. She doesn't do anything special with the part, but she doesn't hurt the movie at all. Catherine Bell is her normal hottie self in the movie, but once again thats the only reason they brought her aboard. Steve Carell as Evan is probaly the funniest character outside of Bruce and you will laugh because of him.

This is a great movie. It's funny and it's not offensive at all. It has a happy good feel ending that you can actually learn something from it. If you love Jim Carrey you have to pick this one up. No collection of his is complete without it. This movie made almost $250 million at the box office so pick it up and see why. You won't regret it.",1098489600,,2669,4.285714285714286

My theory is that Carrey took this part to maintain his standing in the box office after the commercial and critical failure of ""The Majestic"".  After working with esteemed directors like Peter Weir, Milos Forman, Ron Howard, and Frank Darabont how can he return to a journeyman like Tom Shadyac?  Morgan Freeman is adequate in the role of God but he's got to find a part that will deliver him that elusive Oscar.  Jennifer Aniston is solid as Bruce's long suffering girlfriend, but then, she is just starting to establish a film career.

However one day, after getting angry with God, God himself replies back and takes Nolan up to heaven with him and asks questions about his life and why he's badmouthing him. Nolan as a result, believing in asking God to make things better, is given the task of running the world with God's powers for a while but he realizes just how hard God works in order to make things better for the entire world.

 ""Bruce Almighty"" is divided in three parts: the first part introduces Bruce (Jim Carrey) to us, we find out about his job, his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), his dog and his ""bad luck"". The second part is by far, the best of the movie: God (Morgan Freeman) gives to him His powers, and Bruce uses them for his own benefit, this translates in very, very funny scenes and jokes. The third part is the weakest part of the movie: it's packed with sentimentalism and cheesy drama, proper of Adam Sandler's cheap comedies.

1907458,4,B0000AKCKI,"ACTING:  As usual, Jim Carrey does an outstanding performance.  Of course, his acting is quite similar in everything that he does.  Jennifer Aniston, however, does terribly.  It's hard to take her role seriously at all.  Since I never watched ""Friends,"" I did not realize that she lacked any talent whatsoever.
In any case, the story was very clever.  The notion that one wants to fire God because He is not living up to our expectations is a long standing concern.  Mere mortals think that we could do a better job.  In this story, though, God hands over his power to Bruce for him to use as he sees fit.  There are two rules: (a) respect free-will; (b) and don't let anyone know you're God.  The movie is quite clever in placing many highly religious symbols near Bruce.  During a party a Golden-cafe is quite noticeable; a man Bruce helps says ""God bless you"" to Bruce, even though, according to the story, Bruce is God.
Bruce learns that when he is granted God's powers he has a hard time dealing with the enormous number of things that God must do.  Despite hearing many prayers, and hoping to respond to them, he has a hard time with this task.  It is a task-intensive job.
With unlimited powers, many people would probably feel as though they would be happy and could accomplish anything they wanted to.  But with the burdens of responding to prayers and feeling invicible, Bruce still was not happy.  His relationship with his girlfriend was falling apart, and he could not use his powers to make her love him.  He had to do the right thing in order for that to happen.  To do so, ironically, he had to become a mere mortal once again, subject to the dangerous of everyday life.  And when one unfortunate incident does happen -- to be left unsaid for those who have not seen the movie -- his girlfriend falls in love with him again, perhaps, at first, out of sympathy.

Not only do you get a hilarious and laughable movie with the indespensable Jim Carrey, but you get a lot of neat extras along with it such as a commenary with the director, and tons of deleted scenes which are always cool.
At first I really didn't expect much from this film. I thought about the controversy coming over it about trying to mock God, and I was a little suspicious about that too because I'm a christian, but there's no reason to doubt because even the common christian can get a good laugh out of this one. There are tons of biblical cliche's that even a person like Jim Carrey can change from serious, to hilarious.
Bruce Nolan (the lovable Jim Carrey) is a completely misunderstood news caster. Always being put second in line, people with less talent are given the things he should get, even having a breakdown to this factor, and getting fired. But when he is paged to come downtown to a small building, he decides ""Hey, got nothin' else better to do"". There, of all beings to meet, he meets the Creater, the Almighty One, the supreme being; God (Morgan Freeman, a great God by the way). After blowing off the fact that he has met the all powerful one, God endows him with all the powers to show him just how hard it is to be God. After much mayhem, many laughs, and confusion just to impress people, Bruce decides there's more to life than just living high and mighty all the time.
A great movie for anyone to watch. It also has a good message to it which every good movie needs. Bruce Almighty should've been given a lot more credit than it has, but it gets enough of that from its fans. Jim Carrey rocks. Five stars to just him alone, and five stars to great everything else.

1907466,3,B0000AKCKI,"In the gentle comedy ""Bruce Almighty"", Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a fluff-reporter who longs to become anchorman. When he is passed over for a promotion, Bruce curses God to his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), insisting that God's rule of the world is not satisfactory and that he could do a much better job of running the world himself. What he is not expecting, however, is for God (Morgan Freeman) to appear and give him this very responsibility and privilege.
 The film is predictable but successful in its portrayal of what the world would be like if a human being, and a disgruntled one at that, was given the task of ruling the world. Jim Carrey achieves most of his laughs through his slapstick humor and characteristic goofiness. Meanwhile, Jennifer Aniston adequately plays her part as the devoted, do-gooder girlfriend who stands beside Bruce in supporting his career ambitions even when he is too wrapped up in himself to realize she is yearning for him to propose. The deadpan, cool-as-a-cucumber demeanor of Morgan Freeman's God is well-matched with Bruce's playful humor.
 Perhaps the film suffers most when it oversteps its boundaries in terms of making a statement about morality. Rather than simply portraying Bruce as selfish and acknowledging that no person is fit for the task of ""playing God"", the film throws in a contrast between Bruce and Grace. According to Grace's best friend, every night before she goes to bed, Grace kneels down and prays. She also works in a day-care center and donates blood to blood-drives.
 Aside from this cheesiness, ""Bruce Almighty"" works in the sense that it is an amusing film filled with light-hearted laughs that ponders the age-old question of what would happen if a mere mortal was ever made to fill the shoes of the Alpha and Omega. The best time to watch this flick is if you are in need of a fluffy comedy to calm you down or relax your nerves.

Unhappy with his lack of success at work, and generally disatisfied with life, after more than his share of mishaps, Bruce (Carrey) takes to fist waving the almighty, and blaming him for all that is wrong in his life, and the World in general. God, played with laconic sobriety, and more than a little pathos by Morgan Freeman, decides to teach Bruce a lesson by giving him his own job for a few days, to see how he could improve on it, and the results are more than hilarious. The story doesn't however fall into any traps, and balances the humour with some clever, and often poignant lessons for our unlikely hero, along the way, leaving the viewer will a well rounded visual treat. Very few movies have me laughing out loud like this one, and although Jim Carreys brand of expression might not be to everyones taste, the supporting cast including the aforementioned Mr Freeman, and Jennifer Aniston add much to the scheme of things.

This movie had some hilarious parts, and then again, some very sobering parts.
This movie shows how we can all be so human, the want for things! But it also shows us the human side of God! He made us how we are for a reason.

1907476,3,B0000AKCKI,"""Bruce Almighty"" is a reasonably funny Jim Carrey film which gets limited use from it's star's athletic brand of humor.  Say it ain't so, Joe, but could Carrey be slowing down somewhat?  I remember back in the mid-80's when Robin Williams began to tackle less frenetic and more serious roles.  Was it that he was trying to be taken more seriously as an actor or just felt like he had worn out that familar vehicle?  It appears that Carrey may be on that same track.  He even looks much older and more mature in this film.  While ""Bruce Almighty"" is far from serious, it IS a definite departure from films like ""Dumb and Dumber"" and the ""Ace Ventura"" franchise.  Carrey shows flashes of his former physical brand of humor in ""Bruce.."", but even he would have to admit that he's more sedate in this movie.
Carrey plays a sterotypical ""loser"" in the film who, when he doesn't get the ""big promotion"" at the television station in which he works, blames everybody but himself. Especially God. In scenes reminiscent of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Carrey takes stock of his life and his future and wallows in the dispair of his present.
As he continues to express his displeasure with the Creator and blame his problems on Him, he finds a phone number on his pager that he feels compelled to return.  When the voice on the other end invites him to a meeting at an abandoned building, Carrey takes him up on it.  Of course, it is at the building that Carrey meets up with God (played by the wonderful Morgan Freeman).  God gives Carrey the opportunity to ""play God"" for a while to see how he likes it and to find out how tough a job it really is.
From that point, the story takes some familar Jim Carrey comedy turns and fans of his particular brand of humor will find it quite funny.  The rest of the movie is spent with Carrey wishing that he didn't have the power of God and trying hard to give it back.  It's the typical ""grass isn't always greener on the other side"" motif that was present in movies such as the aforementioned ""...Wonderful Life"".
Jennifer Anniston is quite good as the long-suffering girl friend of Carrey who tries to be supportive but finds herself drifting away from the new persona that Carrey has as Bruce Almighty.  Once again, a pretty standard ""boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy regains girl"" plotline is used by Director Tom Shadyac to help tie the movie together at the end.
All in all, this certainly is not a movie that will gain Carrey his star of fame outside of Graumann's Chinese Theater, but I can't say that it's not an enjoyable movie either.  There are some great scenes with the dog and the tongue-tied anchorman scene is really funny and quite painful in a way!  It's got a lot of fluff, but Jim Carrey fans will more than likely get a kick out of it.

1907477,3,B0000AKCKI,"When Bruce Almighty first came out, we skipped it. Although I do think Jim Carrey can be funny, he's a one-note joke. Like Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell, he's funny when the script matches his particular talents. When it doesn't...he's not.
There's something of a theme to Carrey scripts: a situation gives him the ability to be crazily elastic - The Mask, The Grinch, and Batman Forever being prime examples. He's a living cartoon. He makes funny faces. He's funny, get it?
Carrey IS funny. I loved him in the Mask, hated him in the Grinch, and felt bad for him in Batman Forever. Bruce Almighty falls somewhere in the middle - it has a theme with pretty serious implications but it never rises above a Jim Carrey vehicle where he gets to be goofy and make funny faces.
The problem with Bruce Almighty is that it's about faith minus the religion. Which is fine, except that faith is now apparently vague references to God, and that's about it. Call it Bruceology.
Which is fine, except Bruce HATES GOD. He doesn't seem to have a valid reason to do so - certainly, there's absolutely no evidence that he's been brought up to believe in God or even care what God thinks. So it's more than a little forced when Bruce begins stomping around claiming, ""God hates me!"" Bruce seems more like an agnostic or an atheist. But he sure isn't the type to feel God has a personal hatred of him.
You can probably guess what happens next: God gives Bruce God-powers over a series of blocks in Boston. What happens next is actually an interesting guide to role-playing a deity, but only gamers think that way. Basically, it's Bruce being selfish in spectacular, God-like fashion and imitating God from movies he probably never saw (and we didn't either). Bruce Almighty smacks of condescension in a way that makes you start to suspect the producers think you're a moron and won't really remember (or never saw) The Ten Commandments or heck, even read the bible.
And yet...and yet there is one moment in Bruce Almighty that almost made me pee from laughing so hard. Ironically, the humor comes from Steven Carell playing Evan Baxer, Bruce's archrival for the anchor position on a news show. Over the span of what seems like an eternity, Bruce turns Evan into a gibbering idiot, forcing him to shout in a long, drawn out howl ""NEWWWSS!"" as if her were afflicted with Tourettes Syndrome. It's something you shouldn't be laughing at...you feel guilty for laughing. But hell, I'm laughing about it now.
I've come to the conclusion that someone IMITATING Carrey is actually funnier than Carrey himself.
Bruce Almighty has its moments. But it's not as funny as it should be because it doesn't take the premise seriously enough to be seriously funny.",1079913600,,2726,4.705020920502092

Jim Carrey is hysterical, and there are a number of poignant scenes as well.  In some parts of the film I was doubled-over laughing.  When you don't want to watch a film that will make you ""think too much"", and you want something light but good, this film should do the trick.  In some ways, this film reminded me of that other Jim Carrey film.... the one where he's ""living in a soap opera"".  Both films had a similar feel to them, a certain poignancy....",1079654400,,564,4.283018867924528
1907480,3,B0000AKCKI,"Not really being a big Jim Carrey fan (his performance in The Truman Show aside), I wasn't really relishing watching another one of his clownish performances.  However, the twist here is that the concept behind this is so good that you wonder why it hasn't been done before.  Carrey plays Bruce, a put-upon news reporter who doesn't get the anchor position he'd coveted and defies God to make his life any worse than it already is.  Enter Morgan Freeman as God, handing over the reigns to Bruce while he takes a well-earned vacation.
The first half of this movie is the most fun, with Bruce parting his tomato soup, creating the perfect romantic evening with girlfriend Grace (Aniston) and facing off with a group of thugs.  Carrey's rubber-faced antics work very well in these scenes and there are some very good jokes along the way - God's last break was apparently the Dark Ages.  Unfortunately it all unravels a bit when the inevitable occurs and Bruce realises that being God isn't as easy as it might first appear.  Unfortunately, rather than discussing more pertinent issues, the only result of Bruce answering 'yes' to all his incoming prayers is a lottery debacle and a power cut.  Strangely enough, a tsunami he caused by lassoing the moon and bringing it to his balcony, is only giving a fleeting reference.  This is all coupled with a hokey resolution where Bruce realises the humility in small deeds and, literally, that all you need is love.  This attempted 'serious' ending not only tries to spoon-feed its audience with simplistic morals, but really lets down the first half of the movie, which really is very funny.  You can't help but feel that the movie should've gone all out simply for fun, or attempted to discuss the wider repurcussions of Bruce's actions as God.  But I guess that might not have packed them into the multiplexes as much as this.
Still, the movie (clearly Carrey's longed-for middle ground between the critical acclaim he received for Man In The Moon and the audience-friendly Ace Ventura) did well at the box office and is very funny a lot of the time.  Even so, compare this to other blockbusters of last year - Pirates Of The Caribbean, Finding Nemo, Lord Of The Rings - and there's a very big gap.  Not a failure perhaps, but a brilliant concept a little bit wasted.",1078704000,,2310,4.7164179104477615
1907481,5,B0000AKCKI,"This may not be the funniest movie of Jim Carrey but its really the most B E A Uiful one.  Sometimes we belive that we are the only one in the planet, that other people don't have any problems and we feel like God forgot all about us, but that is not true and i think that is the meaning of this movie. Is truly funny and not discusting, with a wonderful ending (ok some people may disagree with me about the wonderful, but belive me i had been very disapointed about the endings of almost all the movies recently)Jim Carrey is the best!!!",1078444800,,539,4.1826923076923075
1907482,3,B0000AKCKI,"Though it's not crass like ""Ace Ventura,"" ""Bruce Almighty"" is Jim Carrey once again executing his usual stunts - over-acting, spouting not-quite-clever catch-phrases (""B-E-A-Utiful""...? Whatever...). Though these things annoy me personally, they admittedly do well in the box-office. Having enjoyed him so thoroughly in more innovative roles like ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Majestic"" (the latter of which may not have been the best, but was a nice deviation from his norm), I was hoping he'd continue down a more discerning path, since his rubber face and rear-end ventriloquism are only funny the first few times.
On a more positive note, this is a movie to which I'd take my preteen brother. It's clean and funny, as trite and unoriginal as the jokes may be. One particularly good scene is more to the credit of Steven Carell (known for his reporting on ""The Daily Show"") than any inspiration by Jim Carrey.
Take your kids, perhaps. Watch it on a Sunday afternoon when you have a few hours to waste. Don't expect much and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Expect it to be as funny as your friend said it would be, and you'll be disappointed.

  It's actually fairly respectful of the REAL important Christian issues (more so than ""Oh God"" was).
  Suspend your judgement on God giving over His powers to someone like Bruce. It's only a story and it's not a preaching story (for either side). God created us to be creative. As Tolkien can create a universe, so can the writer of this movie. Unless it's completely and intentionally blasphemy (it's not), then we need to judge it based on the story and its respect for what is right and good.
  The movie shows greed. The movie shows power in the hands of sinful man. The movie shows redemption. It shows these in an enjoyable film. Jim Carrey is not completely over the top in his acting as he usually is.

1907484,5,B0000AKCKI,"Bruce Almighty
Director Tom Shadyac was trying to portray faith and belief in a realistic setting.  This movie was rife with comedy, yet it told the truth about how we shape our own lives and destiny with the power of faith, belief and our own words, and whether we take responsibility for our own actions or not.  Personal faith and or belief have its ups and downs just like life depending upon the circumstances.  Life is not a rose garden; it changes and does not remain the same.
Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) learnt this lesson the hard way.  He yearns for the anchor position on the News.  He was not ready for the position and yet he expected it to be given to him.  By stating that he was not ready for it, I mean that he did not want to do the work required to prepare for it.  Interestingly Bruce is like a like of so-called Christians, expecting the best that life has to offer without paying the dues required.  When things do not go his way; he whines to anyone who would listen.  He in effect created his own negative world, blamed others for it, and never took the responsibility himself for his own actions.
All the aspects of God's provision were available to Bruce, but like most of us, he was blind.  He asked God for a sign and was given several, but never even noticed.
When God (Morgan Freeman) gives him a chance to experience a little of what it is like to be God, Bruce delights in using the power for his own wants.  However here is where the lesson comes in.  Individual selfish, callous actions cause others to suffer.  At times like this it seems that God's grace departs from our lives, in Bruce's case it was his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) who moves herself from his personal while he learns the lesson.
Later on Bruce is told by God that ""Everyone has the power to be a miracle.""  The trick is to be responsible to use it for the good of humankind and not for selfish reasons.  The ending of the movie has a surprise twist that reiterates the message.  God is within everyone (the sign holder), with the power to make changes in lives one day at a time.",1077753600,2,2090,4.361757105943153

In the same manner he did when he was on ""In Living Color"". I'm sorry Homie the Clown, but fire marshall Bill was the funniest character on that show. Here Carry plays Bruce Nolan. A guy who can't really catch a break in life. After complaining enough about how God seems to ignore him. God (wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman) gives Bruce all his powers. Bruce then decides to fix a few wrongs in his life before even beginning to help others. This includes giving his girlfreind (Jennifer Pitt) bigger breasts, getting his arch-rival fired, and revenge on a gang.

1907488,4,B0000AKCKI,"The premise isn't much.  Jim Carrey gets to play God.  Far fetched?  Sure.  That's what makes it worth watching.
If you want theology in a movie, well, I'm not sure where you go to get that.  Holy Writ, not Hollywood screenwriters (would that be 'Holly writ'?), would be my guess.  Obviously, a movie with Jim Carrey is not making an attempt at being theologically correct.  It's a movie.  A Hollywoood movie, at that.  I think we expect too much out of Hollywood.  It's Hollywood, for God's sake.  It has its limitations, especially when success is measured in mass appeal.  Obviously, if the masses enjoy something, it can't be too deep.
That being said, it's a fun movie, especially if we view it not as a theological treatise but as a movie that does have a positive spin to it.  It's good for some laughs.  I too expected this to be a hideous film but I was pleasantly surprised.
It deals generically with topics such as God's will and power, prayer, as with selfishness and selflessness and a more 'philosophical' approach to some of life's quirks.  It's watered down theolgoy for the rest of us.  It doesn't answer theologically deep questions but there are some thought provoking moments in the film.

1907490,3,B0000AKCKI,"When this movie first came out, I was pretty wary of it.  Of course, there were the knee jerk reactions by some evangelical pastors who may of condemned the movie without even watching it, but who could blame them?  Jim Carey, although a immensely talented actor (i.e., The Truman Show) have been in some pretty raunchy movies; but the more I heard about this movie, the more it appealed to me.  So, down to the video store we went.
It is probably too much to ask that any Hollywood producer take a evangelical view when making a movie, but despite some weaknesses (the sin issue is not dealt with at all- maybe Carey's character Bruce Nolans life is falling apart because of the sin in his life) this movie is a serious attempt to deal with the nature of prayer.
Of course, there are the pranks and the silliness one would expect from a Carey movie, but this movie does provoke one to thought.  What exactly is the relationship between free will and a God who loves us?  There is some profanity which is too bad, it adds nothing to the movie and seems to be stuck in there just to give the movie an edge.
Yeah, rent the movie, but I would not show it to children under Junior High age.",1076457600,3,1186,4.324324324324325
1907491,3,B0000AKCKI,"I was somewhat leery about watching BRUCE ALMIGHTY because of all the various reviews I had read and some of the things I had heard. After seeing the film, I found it to be a decent movie that had a great deal to say about the importance of prayer. Jennifer Aniston was perfect as Grace and she outshined Carrey in every scene they shared. Morgan Freeman was a nice touch, because he's such a talented actor that he brings a touch of class to any project, no matter how bad it is. Those are the positives.

Now, for the negatives. To begin with, this is not one of Jim Carrey's better movies. The film is supposed to be a comedy, but it also portrays itself as a film with a very serious message. Therefore, Carrey's antics, as humorous as they are, really don't fit in with the reality of the movie.

Which brings us the main thing wrong about the film: the central message of the film is about the importance of prayer and how powerful prayer can be. God does listen to our prayers. In this materialistic, post-modernistic, unmoral world we are living in, it's good for people to be reminded of the power and importance of prayer. God does hear our prayers and we have to trust Him that what happens in our lives will eventually turn out for the best (if not in this world, in the world to come). That's a great message. However, it's only half the story. God is love, but God is also Truth.

God is holy and cannot exist with sin. Sin is a word people don't like to talk about, but just because many ignore it doesn't mean it stops to exist. BRUCE ALMIGHTY has a lot to say about prayer, but it doesn't say anything about sin. Bruce was mad at God because his life was falling apart around him and he didn't understand why. Now, I'm not going to say God wouldn't answer him, but Bruce never once consider that maybe God was trying to answer him, but couldn't because of the sin in Bruce's life. Bruce and Grace were living in sin, pure and simple. Their fornication and immorality shouldn't be taken lightly. But, in the movie it is. In fact, it's paraded, made to seem perfectly legitimate, perfectly okay with God. Fact is, God hates fornication. He detests it. Sin is sin and though we can be forgiven of our sins, if we blatantly continue to live in sin without any repentance, it is seriously going to hinder our relationship with God. So, that's that.

As a movie, BRUCE ALMIGHTY isn't too bad. It's fairly entertaining and it is nice to see Jim Carrey coming back to his comic roots. The movie also has a lot to say about the power of prayer. Nevertheless, the film does have some serious flaws, mainly how it totally ignores the issue of sin. If you're going to talk the talk, you should walk the walk as well.",1076371200,,2721,4.3609467455621305
1907492,4,B0000AKCKI,"Jim Carey is one of those comedic actors which you either love or hate. You'll either find him hilarious or rediculous, but whatever your take on Carey, Bruce almighty is Carey at his absolute best.
Similar to ""Liar Liar"", bruce almighty has a fanciful yet very intrigueing basis for the plot: What if you could be God? Carey plays a man named bruce, an aspiring reporter living in Buffalo NY for whom it seems life is being less than fair. Carey's acting is more adult directed in Bruce almighty as opposed to his more children targeted portrayal of Liar Liar. With some serious, though always a little on the light side, moments, carey shows how to be funny while having some deeper notes present as well. After complaining about God and asking why God doesnt fix his life, God finally answers Bruce (The main character)... by paging him of course. Bruce travels to a seemingly abandoned warehouse which also turns out to be the headquarters of the big guy himself. God, angered that bruce is critical of his work, offers Carey the job of being God to see if he can do any better, and thus we are off onto an amusing and sometimes touching ride.
Morgan Freeman, does a great job playing God, and the choice to make God black is a nice little humorous touch. Bruce Almighty is packed with scenes that will just plain make you laugh out loud, the whole point of a good comedy. While sometimes being a bit silly, as most of Carey's movies tend to be, Bruce Almighty manages to do a good job balancing the good humor with the ""so stupid you have to laugh"" humor. The movie also did a great job blending in some emotional depth without having it clash with the funny stuff.
Bruce's struggle to cope with his newfound powers brings some philosophical morals to the story. As God bruce is all powerful, but the catch is that he cant mess with free will - a minor but extremely complicating factor for him. After spending most of his time greedily using his powers to benefit himself, he finds himself impotent when trying to help all the scores of people praying for things, while not interfereing with free will. Once having problems with his Girl friend played by Jenifer Anistan, Bruce also finds himself powerless, as he simply cannot force her to love him.
This all ads some more interesting elements and some really touching moments to the film, moments handled much better than in similar movies. The message of the movie can be sumed up when God tells Bruce that people should look to themselves instead of looking to the skies for help. And of course Bruce learns the important lesson of what really matters in life (love not carear) and that sometimes we must accept our place in the world and rise above our ego's desires to be more than that. Rarely can a comedy explore such questions without being corny and yet still managing to be funny.
While I wouldnt give it a perfect 5, I have to say I liked this movie a lot, and I think most anyone will come away from Bruce almighty both with a smile and perhaps even a little enlightenment.",1076198400,,3043,4.534545454545454

1907507,3,B0000AKCKI,"All in all, this is a funny, entertaining film that showcases its cast's talent well. While there is little actual substance here, and we can all guess the story's twists and turns well ahead of time, part of the fun is that we know the story and we know the likely outcome, but Jim Carrey takes us on the journey and we're never quite sure which particular road he's going to take to get us there.
Naturally, Bruce undergoes a spiritual and emotional journey throughout the film - it's somewhat cliche, but it works here. Jim Carrey is absolutely hysterical - he was built from the ground up for wild and wicked comedic roles, and his facial expression and over-the-top physical comedy stunts are fantastic. Morgan Freeman's God is warm, comforting, fatherly, witty, humorous and generally wonderful in ways only Morgan Freeman can be. Jennifer Aniston is her usual adorable self, and does a good job as Grace.
""Bruce Almighty"" centers around, strangely enough, a fellow named ""Bruce."" Bruce cannot catch a break to save his life - despite working hard as the ""fluff"" reporter for the local evening news program (covering the local bakery or cutesy-poo stories,) when it comes time to select a new anchor person, he is passed over for an obnoxious, smarmy desk jockey. This, as far as Bruce is concerned, is the last straw between himself and God - he rants and rails at God, demanding an explanation. When God begins to manifest himself to Bruce, Bruce has no clue what's going on, and ignores him. At last, God (played so very well by Morgan Freeman) manages to get his attention, and Bruce is bestowed with all of God's powers - since Bruce is so convinced he could run things better, God gives him that chance. Bruce's nature, however, is not to help people - at least not initially.
At first, he's pretty darned wicked and entranced by his own powers. Hilarity ensues, of course, and one of the funniest scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie occurs when Bruce takes his vengeance upon aforementioned smarmy anchorman. Soon, however, Bruce realizes that he's in waaaayyyy over his head, after his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) leaves him, the city of Buffalo riots, prayer emails come in on the order of millions per hour and things generally don't go as planned, so God makes several appearances to help steer him in the right direction. Once the floor is all mopped up, so to speak, and things settle down, Bruce realizes (of course) that being God is difficult work, indeed, and best left to the professional.
The DVD extras are entertaining, showing ""The Process of Jim,"" which gives us a sneak peek into how Jim gets a scene the way he wants it, ad-libbing all over the place, doing impromptu comedy with bakery implements, cracking up the cast and crew - very good stuff. The outtakes and deleted scenes are also very funny and interesting, and include director commentary that one can turn off and on.
I recommend this highly to any Jim Carrey fan, and in general to anyone looking for a little mindless fluff comedy to pass a couple of hours.",1074470400,,3057,4.71588785046729
1907508,5,B0000AKCKI,"Jim Carrey can truly be considered one of the great phyiscal comedians of this generation, and maybe of all time. His earlier films have demonstrated his skill to be funny, at times being ridiculous, even outright bizarre, but they have also demonstrated his immense ability to put comedy on the shelf and rely on his abilities as a ""serious"" actor. ""Bruce Almighty"" takes whats best about Jim Carrey and blends them together into a comedy that is much more than just stupid humor.<.
This is comedy at its best. Not as crazy as some of Carrey's earlier work, it is nonetheless a great film and a lot of fun, with enough of Carrey's classic style of humor to keep his devout fans entertained and to keep all audiences engaged from beginning to end.

1907509,3,B0000AKCKI,"This mostly family friendly movie is the funniest God movie yet that also works as a pro - God story.
I'll say it blountly, some God-themed movies are vehicles to tweak or belittle those who believe in God.  This one isn't.  And coming at a time when believers and everything religious is under assault, this movie just made me feel good all over.
There are similarities to the old Oh God movies, but real differences.  This time we have God give his powers to a self centered me me me type of guy Bruce Nolan played by Jim Carrey.  Bruce is a funny guy who is in the perfect job for his unique abilities to inform and entertain, but who hates his life, and blames God.  So God basically says - You think you can do better.. here, have my powers and you be God!
There is one bit in the middle of the movie where Bruce manipulates his rival into acting like an idiot on air.  The bit is amazingly well done by the actor Steven Carell.  I never heard of this actor and will be curious to see if his career goes anywhere based on this performance.
Jim Carrey is perfect in his role and he makes almost every scene fun to watch.  Morgan Freeman is perfect as God with a sense of humor.  Jennifer aniston is good as the cute and cudely girl friend.  Catherine Bell is a WOW as the darkly seductive Co-Anchor.
I can't give it 5 stars because it was not a Great movie, but it is better than average .....it is family friendly, sort of.  All my children (ages 7 to 27) liked it.

1907511,5,B0000AKCKI,"I have to be honest, as a child, I used to love films with Jim Carey, but after I hit 12, I hated them. I found them cheesy and predictable, so I'm sure you can understand why I was quite skeptical about watching Bruce Almighty. But it was well worth the risk.
 This is a very entertaining film that opens just as any other Jim Carey type of movie, but turns into more than that. The film is funny, enthralling, but the light drama about self-discovery, faith and prayer is what stands out above all. The film was directed by veteran comedy filmmaker Tom Shadyac, who also directed Carey in Ace Ventura (a film which I hated immensely); Pet Detective and Liar, Liar. In addition to Carey, the whole cast is solid with Morgan Freeman as God and Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's dedicated girlfriend.
Carey plays television reporter Bruce Nolan, who is always looking to make it to the big top as Buffalo, New York's nightly anchorman. However, Bruce is always stuck with side stories that he enjoys doing, but wants more. He is continually supported by his sweet school teacher girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), who just wants happiness. As the film opens, one bad thing after another happens to Bruce including losing his job, and he blames God for picking on him.
The next thing he knows is he is summoned and encounter by God (Morgan Freeman), who endows Bruce with all of his powers, since he believes he can do better. With the powers, Bruce walks on water, gets a flashy car, and makes his dog use the toilet among other things. However, when things get out of hand due to his self-indulging choices of his new powers, instead of helping others, he turns back to God for answers.
 Bruce Almighty is a light comedy with the force of Jim Carrey that is better than what it first perceives to be.",1073952000,,1796,4.557275541795666

'Bruce Almighty' is more entertaining and funniest movie of the year. Not only it has the sense of humor but also the inspiring message behind the wacky story...that how much we avoid or turn away from His presence, He is always there and assuring that He watches over us and He is not deaf to not to answer our prayers. He is Listening to you.

Highly recommend!",1073606400,,482,4.488636363636363
1907515,4,B0000AKCKI,"Best:
1) It was hilarious much of the time and the premise was imaginative.
2) It makes you think about how much responsibility God (or Bruce, temporarily) must have if he really intervenes in people's everyday lives.
3) You get the feeling that a lesson was learned and life will be better once Bruce goes back to being a regular guy again.
4) There are special features including a documentary, outtakes and director commentary.
Worst:
1) They missed a lot of seemingly obvious God jokes (but, of course, they can't include everything).
2) The negative ramifications of Bruce's God-powered antics (like bringing the moon closer to the earth just to create a romantic setting to impress his girlfriend) was greatly underplayed.
3) The choice of Morgan Freeman for the role of God seemed bizarre to me. I doubt that few people envision God looking like Morgan Freeman (but hey, who knows).

1907516,5,B0000AKCKI,"All I can say is if you want to laugh your pants off check this movie out.  Jim Carrey, thus far, is at his best in Bruce Almighty.  His comedic rapport bears similarities to his characters in The Mask and Ace Ventura, and there's no denying how funny this guy really is -- he is definitely going to join the ranks of all the great comedians, such as Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Soupy Sales (maybe I should just list the entire ensemble cast of all those 1950s movies, variety shows, and sitcoms), and a list too numerous to mention.
Supporting Carrey in the film are Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, and Sam the dog. This movie is also a touching film that grapples with the emotions -- the romance between Carrey and Aniston and the other issues in relation to the human heart.
Words can't really describe this film, but only that it is a must to see if you want to wet your pants or hyperventilate laughing.  I guarantee if you're looking for humor, you will find it in this gem of a movie.",1073347200,,1016,4.3936170212765955

1907518,4,B0000AKCKI,"This movie is vintage Jim Carrey!! I laughed at almost every scene. The screenplay was structured properly and the roles were more on-point than any comedy I have ever seen. Carrey's hits include ""The Mask,"" ""Ace Ventura,"" ""Liar, Liar,"" and it seems like we're use to all the lovable characters that he creates. There is no other comic that has the ability to bring joy out of you, make you laugh out loud, and make you cry all in the same instance.
  One thing that will grip you is how the plot leaves you intrigued. Carrey plays the highly-spirited Bruce Nolan, a newscaster who gives the people the ""lighter side"" of news. Everyone appreciates his moral demeanor, except for himself. He has a promising relationship with his wife-to-be, Grace (played by Jennifer Aniston) and what keeps their relationship strong is how firmly she believes in him and has great faith in God. While Grace is spiritually motivated, Bruce feels as if God is ""picking on him"" because he wants the anchor job that his nemesis, Evan (played by Steve Carell) is picked to get. So when Evan gets the job, Bruce loses it during a ""live"" session and is fired from his job. He often seeks God (played by Morgan Freeman) to give him a sign and finally encounters Him. So in order to get what he wants from God, He endows Bruce with his powers to see if He can help others as well as himself any better. This movie is basically a testimony for those who have finally found a revelation and a relationship with God in the midst of their tattered life. You can also pray so much where you only want God to always meet your needs. God helps everyone.
  Bruce finally realizes that he must be able to forgive and put others first before himself when he and Grace briefly separate and he almost loses his life. This a delightful tale and every scene is pretty much a riot. From the Latin thugs in the alley with the monkey, to the gibberish-talking Evan scene, Bruce Almighty is a heaven-sent comedy for the ages.",1073088000,2,1982,4.527932960893855
1907519,4,B0000AKCKI,"The first time I heard of ""Bruce Almighty"", I cringed in my seat. The very thought of Jim Carrey playing with the powers of God was enough to make me a little uneasy. There are very few movies of Carrey's that I would admit to liking, and I'd probably only admit to even remotely enjoying ""Liar Liar"" if you put a knife to my throat and refused to move it until I finally confessed. But not so with ""Bruce Almighty"". This is a film that, though goofy and a little rude on the surface, is really a thoughtful comedy about all the misconceptions people constantly have about God.
Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a news anchor whose career is simply not going the way he'd like. His nemesis Evan(the always funny Steve Carrell) is stealing all the glory, he's constantly late for work and, to top it all off, his dog Sam seems physically unable to go to the bathroom inside the house. Bruce is so frustrated with his life that he decides to turn his back on God, saying that he himself could clear up the mess of his life within five minutes, and that God is neglecting his job. Enter...God! Hearing Bruce's claims that the Almighty is unfit for his job, God(Morgan Freeman) willingly hands the reigns to Bruce, wishing him good luck. After a series of self-indulgences that cause serious unforseen consequences, including the loss of his girlfriend Grace(Jennifer Aniston), the only person who has ever totally supported him, Bruce finally submits himself to God's will, and learns to accept that the world does not actually revolve around him.
There are several clever innovations in the film. When Bruce discovers that he cannot possibly listen to all the prayer requests coming at once (in the form of terribly obnoxious voices in his head), he creates a database where he can read prayer requests in the form of e-mails. The name of the database: Yahweh. When Bruce lassoes down the moon for Grace, a huge freak tidal wave occurs in Japan as a result of ""strange lunar activity"". I'd talk about more of these clever parts, but I wouldn't want to ruin the film.
The DVD is loaded with neat special features, including exstensive outtakes and alternate/cut scenes, all of which are fun to watch, and a couple of which provide just a little more food-for-thought. There's even a short featurette showing alternate cut parts of Carrey's scenes.
""Bruce Almighty"" is sort of a diamond in the rough. Though it's advertised as a wacky, crazy comedy, and looks like your typical Carrey vehicle-lots of chances for the star to use his outrageous facial exspressions(and there's plenty of that too)-there's really quite a bit more under the surface than there seems at first, leaving us with a fun, enjoyable movie that leaves you laughing as well as thinking.",1073088000,,2745,4.7447698744769875
1907520,4,B0000AKCKI,"""Bruce Almighty"" is the only film I paid to see twice this summer, because it's got one of the funniest scenes I've ever watched. On the DVD release, it's chapter 11(the aptly titled ""Bruce's Revenge""), and it still made me laugh to the point of tears.
 Actually, there's a lot of good material on the DVD, including more outtakes and many deleted scenes. One scene which was cut involves Jennifer Aniston's character in the supermarket; commenting on an actress on the cover of a tabloid, she says people only care about that actress' haircut, which is a clever take on Aniston's own hairstyles over the years while starring on ""Friends"".
One change from the theatrical version to the DVD is the scene where Bruce checks his pager to see who's contacting him. The original release of the film used a phone number which turned out to be an actual number in certain areas of the United States. It caused a bit of an uproar when people who had this number were being called relentlessly by more than a few people who'd seen the film. In the DVD release, the phone number's prefix is now the infamous ""555"", which is nonexistent in the real world.
Jim Carrey gives one of his most likeable performances, as a down on his luck reporter who acquires the powers of the Man upstairs. Predictably, some crazy events take place, followed by the necessary turn into sentimentality, a-la ""It's A Wonderful Life""( scenes from that film are actually incorporated into ""Bruce Almighty""). Not entirely original, but Carrey, Aniston, and Morgan Freeman as The Man Upstairs manage to give it a fresh spin. It's a frequently funny movie and an excellent DVD with the extra material. You can't really miss with this one.",1073088000,,1701,4.746621621621622

I think Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's funniest movie since Liar, Liar. His rubberface antics are hilarious, especially when he makes Steve Corell talk gibberish during a newscast. When Bruce Nolan becomes Bruce Almighty, he uses his powers mostly for his own gain but eventually learns he cannot please everybody all the time. Jennifer Aniston is pleasant enough as Bruce's girlfriend and I cried when she prayed to forget him at the end.

Unfortunately, the DVD edition starts with four minutes of movie trailers.

You cannot even stop the disc from playing once the trailers start, except by ejecting it.  AND, this happens every time you load the disc.
This is unacceptable, especially in a medium that normally allows the viewer such varied control over how a movie is presented on their screen.  Because of this bone-headed decision by the DVD makers, I cannot recommend you purchase this disk.

1907526,4,B0000AKCKI,"Up until now many loyal Jim Carrey fans were half-expecting to see their favorite comedian on one of those ?Where are they now?? specials after not appearing a young adult comedy for nearly three years. The man who was once declared a king of comedy seems to have hit a bit of dry spot as of late in his career. Me, Myself & Irene, in which he starred opposite his then-girlfriend Ren?e Zellweger, was not quite the hit many had come to expect from the directors of There?s Something About Mary and though his dramatic performance in The Majestic was critically hailed, Oscar continued to allude Carrey?s dramas as did the movie-going public. Despite finding failure in several films, Carrey did manage to score a successful family hit with The Grinch in 2000. With time taken off to set things in order, Jim Carrey splashes onto the comedy scene in top form once again. This time around he takes on the role of a man who thinks he can do a better job at being God then the big man himself in Bruce Almighty, which will be followed by a new dramatic feature Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Now just as long as Adam Sandler doesn?t appear in any independent films from now until the 77th Annual Academy Awards then Carrey would have a pretty decent year.

The story focuses on a man who, after having the worst day of his life, decides to challenge God and show him that he can be a better ruler of the universe then he is. Bruce Nolan seems to have everything going his way with a beautiful girlfriend, a decent apartment, and a steady job at the local news station and he would appear pretty easy going about it ? when life isn?t bringing him down that is. Bruce?s job is the ?joke? position of human interest reporter which cost him numerous promotions which end up going to the more ?qualified? news anchors who flaunt it in front of his face. And whenever he attempts to help someone, like a homeless man on a street near the news station, he ends up getting punished for it. With all these miserable events taking place within the course of just one day, Bruce reaches the breaking point and snaps by calling upon God himself. He claims that God isn?t doing his job properly and claims anyone could do a better job then he?s doing now. Upon hearing his blasphemous declaration, God gives Bruce the opportunity of a thousand life times: The chance to be God complete with all his powers to do with them what he pleased and prove he can do a better job then he can. There are only two rules: First, Bruce can't tell anybody he is God, and second, he can't affect a person's free will. Sound easy? That?s what Bruce thinks but it isn?t too long till he finds out that he may have bitten more then he can chew. The story for Bruce Almighty, as predictable as it may be, is still entertaining for the situations Bruce is placed in as well as the religious context that is used in an effective, if not unorthodox, way in the story line.

There are only three main characters in the film and the actors that play them are pretty well-known, so one would think this would be a stellar cast, right? For the most part the answer would be yes but there are some performances that would in a ?no? answer instead. Jim Carrey thankfully returns to top form as the lead character in this comedy. And let?s not put Carrey?s dramatic disappointments down too much. It?s those roles in films like The Majestic and Man on the Moon that come into decent use when serious issues are dealt with, which they do in between the numerous comedic sequences. Just seeing Carrey being so funny and then changing almost unnoticeably into a serious state makes him one of the rare outstanding comedic actors out there. There couldn?t have been a more perfect choice for the role of God then Morgan Freeman with the performance he gave in this film. At first it wouldn?t seem like too good of an idea with most of Freeman?s acting experience coming from dramatic films such as Deep Impact and The Sum of All Fears but he doesn?t show much signs of being unacquainted with a different genre. And near perfect comedic timing he has opposite Jim Carrey makes you hope that with this film, he?ll be more willing to test the comedic waters in future films. The only problem based on the cast came from the performance of Jennifer Aniston. Giving her some benefit of the doubt, she does have that attractive look and brings some emotion to the role but mostly she doesn?t show any extraordinary acting talent. Here?s her basic performance: Either she is crying or showing no emotion what-so-ever. She doesn't present anything in the role that the audience hasn't seen before or different from her character on Friends. Perhaps she should just stick with roles like The Good Girl, which was a critical success for her, because her comedic acting is not anything to laugh at.

Overall, Bruce Almighty answers the prayers of many and finally delivers an effective comedic approach to religious ideology without creating too much of a fifer with the zealot minority. Even with the statement, there are just too many small problems to give this film too much of an approval rating. As it was said earlier, the story is decent but it?s nothing spectacular as there several funny elements but there isn?t a steady consistency amongst the sequences of the film. There are several moments that fall flat leaving the audience waiting for the next hilarious moment to appear. While on the subject of humor, too many of Carrey?s jokes are dependant on farts and potty humor to get laughs, when he can get laughs just as easily from witty one-liners. Going back to the film?s story, when it comes to the more serious moments of the feature, it becomes way too sappy and tends to push away numerous audience members that came mostly for the comedy aspect rather then anything else. The first two-thirds of the film are great but the other one-third just turns the feature into another typical romantic-comedy complete with predictable, but happy, ending. Jim Carrey, with some help from Morgan Freeman, is the savior of this film which, had it been in the hands of someone else, could have fallen pretty flat on its face. Bruce Almighty may not be the Matrix Reloaded but it is a nice alternative for those too young or too old to enjoy the sci-fi flick.",1072656000,,6314,4.5809018567639255

1907529,4,B0000AKCKI,"Bruce Almighty is clearly inspired by one Frank Capra film you will see in this film itself.  I don't say 'steal' because Jim Carrey plays a uniquely hilarious and delightful loser-turned-winner of life (so he thinks), whose charm is so irresistible.  Just don't think too much about the film's predictable nature.
Bruce Nolan is working at a local TV station in Buffalo, where he is a kind of celebrity because of his crazy style of 'reporting' the people and news.  And today, he is standing before the camera, telling the story of a boat at Niagara Falls.  Sad thing is, another guy is promoted to the position of anchor which Bruce coveted.
Bruce is depressed, so depresed that he starts to blame God for what God did, or did not.  Suppose God really heard the words, and appeared in the shape of Morgan Freeman who proposes: ""How about doing my jobs?""
The premise is so Capra-like that you can see Jimmy Stewart in Bruce's character when this now alimighy guy 'pulls' the moon for his love Jennifer Aniston.  But the strength of ""Bruce Almighy"" lies in elsewhere; that's Jim Carrey's funny performance as Bruce.  This time, without the ""Mask,"" Bruce can do anything, which means you will be watching many silly ideas realize in the real world, which only Jim can do or think about.  Of course, this is nothing subtle or intelligent, but it is good to see him un-Grinch himself.
It is obvious that Bruce is dealing with the power which is more than he can handle.  Like Capra (sorry again), the film has its darker side implied, but that is restriced to the minimum amount.  The ending is certainly sugar-coated, but it is better than the butterfly and spaghetti scenes of ""Patch Adams.""  I am not particularly a fan of Tom Shadyac, but in my book this is one of his better films, possibly this side of ""Liar Liar.""
It is true that the film should have been made with more calculated skills; think about Bruce who lives with Jennifer Aniston in a pretty decent room.  Hey, who's gonnna complain with the life with lovely Aniston, I say?  Not Brad Pitt.  Not me.  There are many other things which the film should not have done, but still I like ""Bruce Alighty"" for what it is, a showcase of Jim Carrey's comic sense.

I was afraid it was going to be nothing more than the predictable ""play nice"" generics of ""Oh God!""

I was wrong. Beyond what is the funniest movie I have seen in a few years, I believe ""Bruce Almighty"" is a worthy cinematic look at God as the much more serious classic, ""The Robe."" Biblical and poetic license are at play in the movie, but the core messages comes through: God knows best, we don't. Trust God. Be content.

""Bruce Almighty"" is played excellently by the master of over-the-top performances, Jim Carrey. When given the chance to be God, Bruce jumps in headlong, feeling that with ultimate power comes ultimate ease. He discovers quickly that there is more to being God than being able to part the Red Sea. He learns that godly wisdom is not something trifely pulled out the hat of the leader of the universe. When Bruce tries to do the job of God, he shows his feeble human wisdom, creating an array of hilarious situations on Carrey could pull off.

The plot blends sight gags, puns, situation comedy and various subplot interplays with Bruce and his fiance (played with mediocrity by Jennifer Aniston) trying to sort out their relationship, and of Bruce looking for satisfaction in his job.

Morgan Freeman handles his role as the Lord subtlety and respectfully. It could have been easy to abuse the character, but both the writers and Freeman retain the dignity of God without making him staid and elusive.

I fully recommend ""Bruce Almighty."" Religious people, namely Catholics and Evangelicals, will not be offended, and atheists should enjoy the jest. College age church youth groups can watch it together, and discuss it critically, and have a great time in the process.

1907532,4,B0000AKCKI,"I confess I've disliked most comedies by Carrey in the past few years. After ""The Mask"", ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" I felt he did a better job at more 'serious' roles, such as Truman (in ""Truman Show"") and his outstanding work in ""Man in the Moon"". But ""Bruce Almighty"" brought me back into his list of followers.
I loved his performance here. I wouldn't call it touching (have to disagree a bit there, with some of my colleague reviewers), but he's definitely back to being funny as in his best of times! And although he continues to do the faces (actually, one of the funniest moments in the movie is not actually his, but played by the reporter that beats him to the position of news anchor, when Bruce -with God's powers- makes him act wacky while on the air), his true genius comes in the subtle details, with the small jokes that come in and out of a scene without you barely noticing. This becomes more obvious if you peek behind the scenes in the Bonus Features, and see the tens of ideas he came up with for a particular shot (where he lights up the candles in the bedroom to set a romantic mood for himself and his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Aniston).
As for Aniston, I'd like to see her take on different types of roles. Don't know if it's just me, but the last couple of movies I've seen of her (""The Good Girl"" and this one) are starting to look a bit cliched, with her getting into the shoes of 'victimized' partner of someone else. Though her performance wasn't bad in ""Bruce..."" I know she can do a lot better than that, so please do it, Jen!
All in all, I am happy to see that Carrey is still strong as a comedian and a great performer, as he's proved once and again in both funny and more serious movies. Don't give it a five, because I don't see it as a cult classic, but it is well worth checking out: definitely a very funny movie!",1072224000,2,1865,4.286118980169972

This very funny comedy has Carrey being cast as a Canadian TV reporter doing crappy journal pieces on the air. He's basically failing as a reporter and questions God why bad things happen to him. He is then visited by God Almighty(Morgan Freeman)himself and gives Bruce Nolan(Carrey) his job while he goes on break. The once-angry Bruce can now do anything he wants with God's miraculious powers. Jennifer Aniston brings comic relief to the proceedings as well as Freeman. Carrey is back to what does best, a comedy. ""Bruce Almighty"" may be a little low-brow and the jokes are somewhat dated and predictable. The film, as a whole, is still funny and sweet and there's a hidden message in this and it's that no one can't take God's place. NO ONE!",1072051200,,984,4.628571428571429

Bruce takes things a little out of proportion and realizes that he needs to go back to reality before anything else gets out of hand. This movie features Jim Carrey at his best!! Very good buy and fun for the whole family!!
Overall, Morgan Freeman plays an awesome God and does the role really well! Jennifer Aniston plays Bruce's wife, and she does a fantastic job of putting up with all of his mishaps! Their dog makes for a cute accent to the movie too! :)

I want to comment about the religious nature of this movie and let anyone know that this movie doesn't make fun of God or religion.  So if you are afraid of that, don't worry, see this movie!  Bruce Almighty shows a respect for God that one might not expect from Hollywood, and Jim Carrey is great in the comedic parts of the film, as well as the more serious parts.
This movie is PG-13 for a reason, but it does handle religion and God in a way that my in-laws (who are preachers) even enjoyed.",1071532800,,706,4.366412213740458

1907543,4,B0000AKCKI,"After a series of dramatic roles, comedian Jim Carrey returns to comedy with the feel-good comedy hit ""Bruce Almighty"". After being denied an anchor position, TV human-interest reporter Bruce Nolan (Carrey) blames God for his misfortunes and God (Morgan Freeman) offers Bruce the opportunity of his life. As the new Big Guy Upstairs, Bruce has the divine powers to change the world and learns the great responsibility that comes with his new job. ""Bruce Almighty"" is an amusing comic romp that marks Carrey's return to box office success. The movie earned over $500 million worldwide and became one of the highest-grossing comedies to date. The concept is imaginative but the film tends to fall short of its true potential. The story is cute but turns sappy toward the end. Director Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura & Liar, Liar) delivers some wildly funny scenes. Carrey's outstanding comic talent is the film's most significant highlight. The cast also includes Jennifer Aniston, Catherine Bell, Steve Carell and Phillip Baker Hall.

With ""Bruce Almighty"", Universal offers a worthy DVD. The 2003 hit comedy is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The video transfer is quite good with effective sharpness and nice color detail. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS sound options are positively enjoyable with great clarity. The DVD contains a fine audio commentary with director Tom Shadyac, 30 minutes of hilarious outtakes, 15 deleted scenes and likable interactive menus. Unfortunately, the DVD also includes a few forced trailers of other Universal titles.

He loses his job and becomes so frustrated that he questions God about all of the bad things that have happened to him.  He is summoned to an address, ostensibly to find a new job but instead he meets God (played by Morgan Freeman.)  Since Carrey thinks that God is doing a poor job at running the world, God decides to turn his powers over to Carrey.  At first he plays at using these powers and has fun walking on water and parting his tomato soup, but eventually Carrey discovers that there's more to being God than doing parlor tricks.  Some of his actions cause some natural disasters, and before you know it, Bruce has the world in a real mess.  The final blow comes when he offends his live-in girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston, who moves out of their apartment.  He finally learns that being God is not the answer, but instead being God's.

1907546,5,B0000AKCKI,"""Bruce Almighty"" is the divine intervention Jim Carrey's career has needed ever since the disastrously treacly ""The Majestic.""
Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, WKBW-TV's go-to guy when there's a breaking story about Buffalo's largest cookie. However, like Joel McCrea in ""Sullivan's Travels,"" he doesn't see any value in merely getting people's mind off their troubles for a while. He aspires to the anchor job which, instead, goes to his rival, Evan Baxter (""The Daily Show's"" irrepressible Steve Carell).
Nothing is going right in Bruce's life, from his job to traffic jams. So he gives God a piece of his mind and God (Morgan Freeman . . . who else?) gives him the chance to do a better job. Bruce is made God-for-the-week, while the Almighty takes a vacation. When Bruce protests that God never takes vacations, the Lord winks, ""Ever heard of the Dark Ages?""
Carrey is utterly delightful, whether pulling off some hilarious pratfall or energizing the most mundane piece of dialogue. The casting of Freeman -- the actor most likely to be voted to play God by everyone who makes movies or watches them -- doesn't hurt either. He and Carrey are criminally funny together, playing off each other like a classic vaudeville team.
There's some trouble near the finale when the picture doesn't know how to end itself, but that's quickly righted. Otherwise, ""Bruce Almighty"" is the feel-good movie by which all this year's other feel-good movies will be measured.",1071014400,,1451,5.0

I'm very glad that my nephew's friend let us borrow his.  The only scenes that were funny was when Jim first got his powers and he started singing ""I got the power"" by the '90's group Snap.  And when he made the other news reporter talk gibberish.  I thought that was hilarious.  Other than that, it was not all that fantastic.  It did however, have a good moral to the story.

1907548,5,B0000AKCKI,"The concept of ordinary man being granted God's power is a proposition that could lead to inconceivable suffering or hilarity of heavenly magnitude. Thankfully in this film it is hilarity.
The movie is full of the great sorts of Jim Carrey humor that so many of us know and love. The scene where Jim's charachter uses his power to make the news anchor babble incoherently made me laugh harder than I have laughed in a long time. Steve Carrel does wonderfully in this scene and really makes it work. Jennifer Anniston play's Carrey's love interest and Bruce uses his powers to do what any normal red blooded male would do with God-like powers: Cause his woman to climax from an entirely different room. While the scene was meant to be funny, every guy who watches this is going to be thinking ""I wonder if you can really do that..."" Every girl will probably be thinking the same thing.
The suprising thing about the movie is that the basic story is one of a very serious and religious nature. The comedy is just the wrapping paper that conceals a concept of deep philosophical and religious consequence: God's wisdom and will versus the will and wisdom of man. My pastor has even toyed with the idea of showing this film to the congregation (slightly edited, of course) as a lesson about how we should view God.
It is a very good film with some great comedy thrown in. Plus it has Jennifer Anniston faking an orgasm. How can you possibly go wrong? =)",1070928000,,1449,4.555555555555555

Bruce likes using the powers to better his own life, but finds it impossible to meet the prayer demands of the other millions of souls in his hometown alone.
The funniest part of the movie is when Bruce takes revenge on the anchorman whose job he wanted, making him speak idiotically and rant and rave on the air.  Pretty hilarious.

BONUS FEATURES!
Of interest are the ""bonus features"" including scads of deleted scenes and outtakes. For example, there is one scene (shown on TV ads) where the conniving news anchor can't seem to say anything intelligible. It is side splitting funny! Fortunately what is left in the movie is *tastefully* mean. The alternative you find in the deleted scenes involves nasty bodily mayhem to the poor S.O.B. The treatment is so mean spirited it makes Bruce's character disgusting, not amusing.
In this case, I give two thumbs up to the editors for choosing the high road. Some other scenes are similarly justly removed. And a few even give you some insights into things that might not otherwise make sense. If you've seen the movie you may recall a big party scene in a large mansion. One of the coffee tables is covered about a foot deep in shrimp. In the deleted scenes, you learn why!

Bruce Nolan (Carrey) frustrated with his television career on Buffalo's Channel 7 News thinks God isn't being fair by not allowing him to get the anchor position.  On an open highway in the middle of the night Bruce challenges God outright about the way He's running his life.  Accepting the challenge, God decides to introduce Himself to Bruce by paging him to come to an empty warehouse.  Upon meeting, God proposes giving Bruce all His powers to run the world.  Believing this to be a piece of cake, Bruce doesn't anticipate the many aspects of being God like the millions of prayers that need to be answered or the egotistical wants that need to be refused.

1907556,3,B0000AKCKI,"It's been three years since we got a real Jim Carrey comedy. The last being ""Me, Myself & Irene"". While Jim tried to expand his talents with more straight films like ""The Truman Show"", ""Man On The Moon"", and ""The Majestic"", fans were starting to miss what they first fell for Jim in the first place. Comedy. This movie is a relief to those of us who have been waiting to see Jim return to comedy. However, this isn't the manic, over the top frenzy kind of comedy that made Jim famous for in the 90's with fare like ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Dumb And Dumber"". Sure,  some of the zaniness and physical aspect of it is there, but it's not as much as usual. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a field correspondent for the local Buffalo news station who usually covers the more heartwarming and human stories that normally end the newscasts. Things aren't going his way. He wants an anchor job that he eventually loses to a smarmy co-worker(Steve Carell), a dog that urinates all over the apartment, and on top of that, he gets beat up. On the upside, Bruce does have a great girlfriend named Grace, who is played by Jennifer Aniston and looks really good in this film. After Bruce's whining and complaining to God over his less than stellar life, the big man himself(played with the right amount of presence and magic by Morgan Freeman) pays Bruce a visit and offers Bruce his powers while he is on vacation. This is where the fillm starts to pick up speed and starts to let Carrey let loose and have fun. Naturally, as anyone would, Bruce lets his powers get to him and abuses them for his own purposes. When he tries to make some good in the world with his newfound abilities, well, chaos abounds. This isn't exactly an inventive idea. How many times have we seen a film where someone gets powers, or gets a second chance, or gets to trade places with somebody?. Lots of times. So, while it isn't exactly a revolutionary idea, the film rises above all others because those movies didn't have Jim Carrey. He really brings Bruce to life in the beginning of the film by making him seem like a loveable loser in a slump with life. Some say he was very unlikeable, but he was exactly the opposite. He was likeable. He was having a bad time. Not once did I not like, or feel, for the character. Carrey was able to play it with a straight face during these times, and he didn't look like he was always on the verge of a laugh or saying something funny. As some critics have stated. What was surprising, and somewhat disappointing, was how Carrey was more restrained than you would of thought. There are moments of silliness and some old Carrey schtick, but he doesn't go over the top like the good 'ol days in the 90's. His comedic performance in the film was a balance between the physical comedy of ""Liar Liar"", but with the heart and solidness of his ""The Truman Show"" era. One would of wished it had been kicked into higher gear, but it is good nonetheless. Aniston does what she can with the usual ""I've been dating this guy for 5 years and I want a wedding and kids"" girlfriend role, but she manages to bring some heart and emotion to the predictable supporting role. Morgan Freeman was a nice bit of casting as the almighty one himself. His scenes are not very long, but he really brings it and makes the most of his scenes. ""Jag"" star Catherine Bell appears in the film as well, as does character actor Phillip Baker Hall as Bruce's boss. Steve Carell as the slimy co-worker gets one of the funniest scenes in the movie by having a breakdown on the set thanks to Bruce. The extra features on the disc are a lot of fun. Some of the outtakes and deleted scenes are hilarious and you would wish that some of them had ended up in the finished product. As some other reviews had stated, the commercial ads on this disc are annoying and they don't allow you to skip through them. However, I found that if you hit 'menu' on your control, it will come up and you can get through those annoying ads. So, this film is a lot of fun and it has a really nice feeling to it. It has heart, it has emotion, and it's funny. It is a pleasant and enjoyable film to kill a few hours.

1907559,2,B0000AKCKI,"Let me preface this review by saying that I  really wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately I got bogged down in Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey to enjoy the movie more. Now, I'm all for physical comedy but after several movies its starting to get old.
One of the problems I had with this film is that Carrey's character Bruce Nolan is so unlikable for most of the movie it's to feel much sympathy for him at the end. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan who feels that his world is falling apart because God is not giving him what he feels that he deserves.  After being passed over at work Bruce curses God. Following an unusual series of pages Bruce goes to what he thinks is a job interview at Omni Presents where he meets the Almighty in the human form of Morgan Freeman. God informs Bruce that he is taking a short vacation leaving Bruce with all his powers.
The middle third of the film shows how the somewhat selfish Bruce utilizes these powers. The other leads in the film are Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's fiance Grace and Philip Baker Hall as his boss. The talent is available in the movie but it is underused simply as a showcase for Carrey's comedy.
Perhaps the strongest part of this DVD is the always good commentary by Tom Shadyac who explains the plot and spiritual elements that he was working towards. Included are a series of outtakes and deleted scenes. Neither of these features is anything to write home about but do provide an interesting few moments.
A real downside to this disc and all of Universal's current offerings is the forced viewing of trailers before one ever accesses a menu. I don't want to see these trailers everytime I put the disc iun the player. Universal simply needs to find a better way to present thgis material.
This is a light viewing experience which had the potential to be much greater than it actually was.",1070409600,2,1842,4.5119760479041915
1907560,4,B0000AKCKI,"Jim Carrey is hilarious.  There are a couple of scenes in this movie that my wife and I have watched several times, and we still fall out of our chairs laughing.
Yet this movie has some meaning behind it, too.  Jim's character, Bruce, uses the powers of God (that God himself has temporarily given him) in very selfish ways.  In doing so, he hurts others.  He finally realizes that.  But it is through that realization that God teaches him that he (Bruce) has the power to make things better.  That power doesn't come from being able to zap things but from choosing to love unconditionally.
GREAT HOLIDAY GIFT!",1070409600,,610,4.601851851851852
1907561,5,B0000AKCKI,"I like this movie, alot of the movie was hilarious; especially that part where he makes that guy say stuff. Bruce isn't god in this movie, he just has god's powers and stuff. I thought towards the ending got a little boring, and wasn't as funny, but maybe that wasn't the point of this movie.",1070236800,2,292,4.327272727272727

Excellent performances, especially Steve Carrell as a scene stealing anchorman, but why oh why does there need to be a friggin' VISA CARD AD under the ""bonus"" features on this DVD??  Why oh why did UNIVERSAL Pictures feel the need to ruin this DVD in such a cheap manner?  Who is the brain surgeon in their cheapskate marketing department who thought this was a good idea??

1907565,4,B0000AKCKI,"This movie brings Carrey back to what he does best, making people laugh.  He really shines as the down on his luck reporter who gets a chance to use God's powers to change the world.  His improvisational skills as an actor is his prized possession.  He's is hillarious!!  Please view the outtakes and deleted scenes as they are just as funny as the movie itself.  Jim Carrey is Canada's finest import next to Molson Canadian beer!",1070150400,,430,4.605263157894737
1907566,4,B0000AKCKI,"Morgan Freeman is a fantastic choice of actors for the role of God.  While George Burns (Oh God) was excellent for the loving God with a sense of humor,  he really didn't have a frightening side.  I could never picture him as the God of the Old Testament.  Morgan Freeman plays a very patient and understanding God with a subtle sense of humor but his previous roles in films like Insomnia make it pretty easy to picture him as the vengeful God of the old testament too.  Bravo, Bravo!
Bruce Nolan (Jim Carey) is a ""fluff"" news reporter for Channel 7 in Buffalo but wants to be promoted to news anchor.  He is up against stiff competition from Evan Baxter (Steve Carroll).  When Evan gets the promotion and uses some of Nolan's material, Bruce loses his temper on a live feed and things go down hill from there.  After an exasperating day, he blames God for all his misfortunes and asserts that he could fix everyone's problems in 5 minutes.
God takes him up on his bet and Bruce is given all of God's powers with two caveats - he can tell no one and he cannot affect free will.  The comedic things he does with these powers are pretty funny and is the focus of the film.  Most of them have to do with his personal life. However, he does come to appreciate the responsibilities of God and there is one great line - ""How do you make someone love you without affecting free will?"" to which Freeman's answer is ""If you find that out, let me know"".
If Oh God was a religious comedy focusing on religion, Bruce Almighty is a religious comedy focusing on comedy.  Don't look for profound insights into God and religion and so forth. Look for laughs and you won't be disappointed.",1070150400,2,1673,4.39935064935065

My favorite parts were when he had he Saleen S7, my favorite car, how he made the anchor man speak nonsense and so many other parts. My mom was really suprised when she found out that Morgan Freeman was the God. She always looksup to him like a Hollywood God anyway. Also I wanna comment to Steven Cavins, How could you hate this movie? Who the hell cares if this isn't a religious movie. This isn't Carnivale. This is a comedy movie. Plus religious movies are what I could watch when I need to go to sleep!",1070150400,,617,4.19327731092437
1907568,3,B0000AKCKI,"Bruce Noland (Jim Carrey) is a human interest reporter for a local television station who dreams of an anchor position. When he has one of those days when nothing seems to go right and, to top it all off, loses out on a promotion to anchor, he curses God for his misfortune. God apparently took notice. To teach Bruce a lesson, God (Morgan Freeman) endows Bruce with all of his power on two conditions: Bruce can't tell anyone that he has God's powers, and he can't interfere with free will. Now Bruce will see just what God's  responsibilities really are while he tries to use his powers to improve his own life.

""Bruce Almighty"" is a comedy, a romance, and a morality play. Unfortunately, it often seems like it doesn't know which one to be. The romance and morality play angles work out all right. The comedy angle doesn't. Most of the film's comedy is derived from Bruce exercising his newfound powers. But these are the movie's least successful scenes. Bruce being God is just boring. Bruce's relationships with God, his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), and his co-workers are interesting. But most of Bruce's supernatural antics are dreadful. Jennifer Aniston does a nice job as Bruce's patient and put-upon girlfriend. Comic actor Steve Carell gives a real stand-out performance as Bruce's arrogant professional rival, Evan Baxter. Jim Carrey is, well, Jim Carrey. His physical comedy is impressive. His large gestures seem out of place in a tv newsroom, but perhaps they are supposed to. The movie falls down in being a comedy that just isn't very funny, although its less comic aspects fare better. Recommended as a rental.

The DVD: Jim Carrey fans will appreciate the bonus features on the DVD more than anyone else. In ""The Process of Jim"", director Tom Shadyac, who has worked with Carrey on 3 films, comments on Jim Carrey's improvisational techniques. There are several examples of scenes that were shot many times in which Carrey does something different each time. Other bonus features include: outtakes, deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), fairly comprehensive bios of cast, director, and producers, and a decent director's commentary. If you are a big Jim Carrey fan, check out the outtakes and deleted scenes as well as ""The Process of Jim"". If you're not a big Carrey fan, there is nothing very exciting here. Dubbing and subtitles are available in French and Spanish. And, thankfully, captioning is available in English for the hearing impaired.",1069977600,2,2500,4.976076555023924
1907569,3,B0000AKCKI,"Dear Almighty! I am in a minority here, but Jim Carrey's latest collaboration with his Ace Ventura and Liar Liar director deserves three marks at best,and this is why,
Bruce Almighty is a film tailored for Carrey and his abilities, which by far is not a bad thing, for he is one of the best comedy actors of his generation, but for me personally I can only take as much of his repetitive style of pulling faces and body and facial gymnastics, seen in most of his work.
Carrey, especially seen in the outtakes, making ofs and interviews has an incredible and manic energy,a contagious and  funny hyperactivity, and a hilarious unpredictablity, and what we see on screen does not differ greatly from the real person behind the characters he plays: 'method acting' is not something Carrey agonizes over to hit the right spot with his audience.
Tom Shadyac is an able comedy director, who has worked well with Carrey and was responsible largely for reviving the box office appeal of Eddie Murphy.
Jennifer Aniston, one of the few Friends who successfully crossed over to films, is cute, sweet and a good actress to boost
And of course, there are very few people who are good enough to play 'God' on screen,and certainly Morgan Freeman is one.
But I did find the film's message riddled with cliches about life, priorities, doing good, free will vs fate etc..By all means I do not expect all films to treat the subject of God, Creation and the meaning of life as philosophically as Kubrick,Tarkovsky or Scorsese did, it is after all a light comedy for all the family, nevertheless it was quite predictable, and naively treated.
Carrey,a TV reporter pushing on forty, and out of job,complains about his lot in life and blames God for his bad luck. He, however,gets the chance from the Man himself to acquire divine powers to see if he can do better,and predictably enough we see him getting a fancy car and clothes,creating hit stories for his TV comeback,seeking revenge on the 'bad' people from a street gang to a snotty colleague. But with all his new powers he can not easily alter the free will of his girlfriend to come back to him, dumping him after catching him in a compromising position with a sexy anchor (the gorgeous Catherine Bell). This for me is too cliched,sugary and over sentimental to have its desired effect.
There are few funny scenes in the film, especially the post it scene, but as one reviewer rightly put it, the before being God segment of the film is much funnier, while the after is pretty uneven.
You will still enjoy Bruce Almighty, if you can never tire of Carrey's facial gymnastics,but I know  too that Carrey has another acting side to him equally as brilliant,(the one in The Truman Show).This makes Bruce Almighty and the divine Jim Carrey  a must buy for the faithful only.",1069977600,,2805,4.685598377281948
1907570,4,B0000AKCKI,"This is a gem of a film, and one that I truly enjoyed. The humor was clever, and the role of God, played by Morgan Freeman delightful.
My rating would have been 5 stars, but some of their best scenes ended up in special features as deleted scenes. Some of them clearly should have been included in the film, as they were excellent.
For simple, enjoyable moving watching pleasure, this is well worth the time to view, and Jim Carrey is believable as a frustrated television reporter who feels his life tends to fail his expectations all too frequently.
This is a film I have already watched several times since buying it, and recommend it to my friends, and readers here as a bit of divine delight.",1069891200,,697,4.496062992125984
1907571,3,B0000AKCKI,"It's not ""What if God Was One of Us?"" but, instead, what if you were God because God wanted to take a vacation? Bruce Almighty is a very funny movie in no small part due to the supreme acting of Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman. Freeman plays God not as a stern taskmaster but someone who matter-of-factly passes on his wisdom and lessons. Freeman plays the Lord with a self effacing sense of humor and, not surprisngly, it works very well.
Carrey plays a television reporter (the Bruce of the title)who's career has stalled; he's stuck doing the warm, fuzzy, funny segments on things like the biggest chocolate cookie ever baked. No one takes his aspirations seriously. All of this stands in the way of Bruce's biggest goal; to become the evening anchor person for his television station. His rival, played marvelously by the very funny Steven Carrell, has him beat at every turn. He even steals one of Bruce's sign off lines as he acknowledges acceptance on the air of the anchorman position.
Director Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura)brings out the best in Carrey. The comedy is a bit predictable and the script packed with cliches but that doesn't prevent Shadyac, Carrey, Jennifer Aniston (who has a thankless task as the love interest. All she is given to do is to ""react"". Some of her doubletakes do inspire a few chuckles but it's clear that Carrey is the center of attention here), Morgan Freeman and the rest of the cast from presenting some truly inspired scenes and acting. Comdies, like action movies, are now build around a number of set pieces, i.e., sequences that continuously rope you into the movie. Most films that rely on these set pieces don't have a very solid script. The script is a bit inconsistent although there are a number of sequences that stand out more than others.
The DVD looks solid although there's quite a bit of digital artifacts in the way of compression issues during some the night sequences. If you purchased this DVD you'll also note a flaw and I'm pretty sure it was deliberate; everytime you start the movie up you're forced (like some of the Disney DVDs) to watch the coming attractions trailers. This trend was started by Disney and Universal takes it to absurd new heights; you can't bypass it unless you press the fast forward button on your DVD remote. The disc prevents you from accessing the main menu directly. It's annoying, poorly thought out and designed. It's also an example of the shoddy products that Universal has put out of late (including the incorrectly framed Back To The Future trilogy and the interlacing problems with Monty Python and The Meaning of Life which caused the image to blur anytime someone moves). Universal has had a large amount of problems with recalled DVDs of late. If this problem is an accident, I'm hoping Universal fixes the problem soon as this could be really annoying on lots of DVDs. If it was on purpose, they owe it to consumers to discontinue this practice and to correct the problem with the DVDs. Universal's email address is universal@dreamworks@leemarketing.com. If you're unhappy, let them know!
Bruce Almighty is entertaining and, despite a couple of minor swear words, a fun movie. While a bit predictable, Bruce Almighty has a number of worthwhile moments and enough funny sequences to make it worth picking up.",1069891200,,3305,4.8
1907572,4,B0000AKCKI,"Sacrilegious people beware! Bruce Almighty, starring Jim Carrey and Jennifer Anniston, offers a hilarious perspective on an ordinary person inheriting the divine powers of God. Mr. Bruce Knowland (Jim Carrey) is then left to care for the world as God goes on vacation. The film then takes on a much deeper perspective and shows this once ordinary man try to accomplish the extraordinary task of caring for the world.
The movie begins with Bruce Knowland, an average field reporter for Channel 7 news, becoming the victim of a string of misfortunate accidents. His girlfriend of five years (Jennifer Anniston) tries to help him through his tough times. Mr. Knowland, of course, blames God for his misfortunes. After asking for the lord's help, and being ignored, Bruce becomes enraged. Bruce loses his job, his car, and all that is left of his respect towards a silent deity.
 After Bruce gives up, he receives a page. Someone has a job to offer him at a company called Omni Presents. Inside Omni Presents, Bruce meets the Almighty lord. Skeptical at first, Bruce ignores the man and leaves the building. But just before leaving, Bruce is given the divine power. After some hilarious scenes in which Bruce Almighty tests his newfound gift, God explains the rules. Bruce is free to do whatever he wants to except for two things. He can't tell anyone he is God, and he can't do anything to free will. God then leaves for vacation, and reminds Bruce that Bruce thought he could solve everything in five minutes.
 Bruce, an ordinary mortal with the power to do virtually anything, then sets out to correct the own wrongs in his life. He ignores the prayers running through his head for over a week. God then returns and asks Bruce how many people he has helped. Mr. Knowland, now feeling guilty, sets about the task of answering prayers. After hardly making a dent in the number of prayers received, Bruce Almighty replies yes to all. Immediately we can all see how cataclysmic of an action this is. Four Hundred Thousand people in the Buffalo, New York area win the lottery. Riots break out because they all only won roughly 17 dollars. Things of this nature continue on until Bruce Almighty realizes that a mortal such as himself is incapable of handling such a great task.
 All in all, Bruce Almighty is a must see movie. An ordinary man, blessed with the powers of the lord, is unable to cope with the divine responsibilities. Bruce uses the gift as he sees fit, and creates havoc in the streets. This movie, in my opinion, teaches a good lesson in humility. Remember, when the lord does things right, people won't be sure he did anything at all.",1069891200,,2645,4.720779220779221

While I don't think this is an excellent film, it was definitely enjoyable and not as cheap and shallow as I thought it would be.  There are several truly humorous parts, and I don't think the movie really mocks God - while I don't agree entirely with the portrayal of God, or the theology behind the movie, I wasn't really offended, and I think the movie brought up some good questions about the nature of God and free-will.
Bottom line, the movie was humorous and enjoyable.  I dunno if I'll buy the dvd, but it's definitely worth renting.

I don't recall enjoying a single minute of this movie in the theatre, except when I started to imagine Bill Murray in the role (though I doubt even he could have done much with the material here).
Carrey can be funny and even likeable onscreen, but he needs a director who can control him, not the other way around (which I suspect is the problem with this film from the get-go). Even his die-hard fans may want to avoid this one.",1068508800,5,933,4.8742138364779874
1907581,5,B0000AKCKI,"Jim Carey (The Truman Show, How The Grinch Stole Christmas) is one of my favorite actors. So with all that - this movie was refreshing and extremely funny. For those who are not fans of Jim, please understand what he does best is the delivery and timing of physical and quick witted jokes makes him an amazing physical comedian.
Directed by Tom Shadyac (Patch Adams, Liar Liar, The Nutty Professor) It is the story of a regular guy who is down on his luck and always in the wrong place at the wrong time. He gets angry at God and speaks to him in a challenge.
God - brilliantly played by played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Deep Impact, the Sum Of All Fears) is intrigued by his challenge and gives him all his powers for one week. God decides to take a vacation.
Now give Jim Carey the power of God and look out! It's funny and provocative. Many lessons are learned and trials are given. Jennifer Anniston (Rock star, Picture Perfect, Friends) plays his wife and emotionally goes on a roller coaster with his antics and powers of God.
Extremely funny and filled with special effects and sight gags that only Jim Carey could enhance. Fun for the whole family. Sit back and relax and enjoy the humor. The DVD will be out in December. (11-10-03)",1068422400,,1253,4.475982532751091

The basic story is Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) has a bad day when his dream job is given to Evan Baxter (played by Steve Carrell, anyone who is a Daily Show fan will love his acting in this!), so be basically freaks out and goes nuts during his interview and after.  He curses God, so God (Morgan Freeman) comes down and says (in a nutshell) ""You think my job is so easy, you try it."" and he gives Bruce God-like powers for a week.  What happens next is just great!  His revenge on Evan is classic, as is the ""love"" scene with his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston).  Eventually he learns that being God is a lot harder than he expected, and that maybe his dream job wasn't really what he wanted afterall.  Morality lesson, yay!  God takes back his powers, Bruce is happy with his girlfriend and his old job, they live happily ever after.

1907585,4,B0000AKCKI,"When one thinks of Jim Carrey movies, one usually thinks of the ""potty humor"" and physical comedy Carrey is so famous for.  While this movie does deliver enough of these things to keep Carrey's fans interested, it also has a enough humor to keep the rest of us interested.
Carrey stars as Bruce Nolan, a down on his luck TV reporter in Buffalo.  Bruce is assigned to all of the ""feel good"" stories like the people trying to bake the world's largest cookie and feels that the light stuff he reports on is ruining his career.  All Bruce wants is the head anchor job, so when his rival Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) gets the job, Bruce is quite angry.  Lacking a better target to address his anger towards, Bruce decides that god himself is responsible for his problems.  He goes into a tirade about how, ""god is the mean kid"" that is beating him up.
Much to Bruce's surprise, god (Morgan Freeman!!) has heard his angry rants and contacts Bruce.  To shut Bruce up, god gives him full use of god's powers and appoints him celestial guardian of Buffalo.  At first, being a deity is all fun an games.  Bruce uses his new powers to woo his girlfriend (the wonderful Jennifer Aniston) and ruin Evan's career by making him flip out during a news broadcast (Steve Carell steals the movie in this scene).  But then Bruce's actions start to catch up to has as he realizes that his new powers have the ability to harm people.
In addtion to being a fairly decent comedy, Bruce Almighty also has a be careful what you wish for element that deals with the consequences of great power.  I recommend it.",1066262400,,1582,4.480836236933798

While both did decent movies away from their genre, the audience let them know how much they were missed when they came back. In this case, Carrey got the biggest opening weekend of his career.
Ol' J.C. plays a down on his luck weatherman who curses the Almighty once he's had enough. The Almighty responds by summoning him and gifting him with his powers to see what it's like. He does what any of us would do. Moves sugar. Busts fire hydrants. Organizes prayers into e-mail. Reproportions his girlfriend to suit his desires. Oh yeah, and finds himself.
Carrey is in top form here. As is Morgan Freeman. Jennifer Aniston seems a bit wasted. Steve Carrell (The Daily Show) steals his scenes as a pompous anchorman. Catherine Bell (JAG) leads with her considerable cleavage as a conniving co-anchor.

Bruce is a guy who seems to be getting really depressed in life.  He has work problems because he wants to become a news anchor but all he gets is location shoots about stuff like giant cookies.  At home, he has problems with his dog (yes...  dog.  go figure).  After all of his problems start building up, he gets contacted by God on his beeper to come to some building in Buffalo New York.  He goes, and the building seems to be empty besides from an old man who is a janitor as well as god.  Bruce is told that as soon as he walks out of the building, he will have all of Gods powers while god goes on a vacation.  I'm not going to go into much detail, but Bruce realizes that God has much more responsibiltiy than he though, and he ends up causeing more trouble than it's worth with his powers.  Watch the movie for the rest of the details.  It won't win any Oscars, but you'll enjoy it anyway.  Some of the scenes are very humorous, so comedy fans will enjoy it, and yes... Jim Carrey does get annoying after a while.",1064361600,,1125,4.1336405529953915
1907588,3,B0000AKCKI,"This film certainly presented an intriguing concept:  what would an ordinary man do with divine powers?  While this was a clever idea, it is not executed very well in this film that becomes a typical Jim Carrey comedy.
Let's review, shall we?  Every Jim Carrey slapstick fare must have a few vital elements:  1.  Lots of spazzing out and mugging.  2.  A catchphrase (in this case: B-E-autiful).  3. A girl who puts up with his antics (Jennifer Aniston as Grace).  4.  A heartwarming scene at the end as his character learns his lesson.
Carrey is funny as Bruce Nolan, a disgruntled news reporter who's mad at God for the many problems in his life.  But his character is somewhat shallow, using his borrowed divine powers to blow women's skirts up and to part traffic like the Red Sea.  He does wise up in the end, but his transformation seems a bit unbelievable.  In a sense, Bruce echoes Carrey's character in ""Liar Liar,"" an unlikable person on the whole until his final moment of clarity.
Morgan Freeman is funny as the almighty one, but he's great in most films anyway.  Aniston manages to be a sympathetic character, but with her own funny moments as well.  But Carrey does steal most of the movie from anyone else's clutches, and that isn't always a good thing.
I should probably warn parents now that there are many raunchy jokes and a very loud proclamation of the F-word in this film.  So if your seven-year-old loves Jim Carrey, you might want to use caution with this one.
Bottom line:  I did laugh during this movie, but many jokes were not very original or clever.  The performances are good from the supporting cast, but Carrey is over-the-top as usual.  The message of the movie is honorable, but it gets buried and lost amidst the jokes.  All in all, I think it might have been a better quality film if they had focused more on the theme instead of on gags.",1064275200,5,1873,4.550898203592815

He quickly found out that becoming ""god"" comes with a lot of responsibility that he couldn't handle, which eventually turned into a mess almost ruining everything he had in his life..

The scene in the movie that will have you doubled over in pain from laughing so much is when Carey's character Bruce uses his newfound Heavenly powers against his newsroom rival, brilliantly played by Steven Carell.  I almost laughed myself hoarse!

1907595,3,B0000AKCKI,"I must confess that i have been reluctant to go see the movie because it looked like a caricature of Christianity from the reviews and water cooler talk.
The humor comes primarily from Jim Carrey's extraordinary physical humor, very little from any sophisticated wit. The movie started out pretty good, looked like an analysis of theodicy, that is simply ""why good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people"" if a good, powerful, just God is in control of the universe. theodicy is a big, hard problem and i'd welcome humor to help understand even one of the issues involved. But that was not to be in this movie, it lost the intellectual appeal to me with the childish antics that Carrey's character immediately fell into doing when he had God's power. Sure the scenes are cute but the humor doesn't rise above the level of freshman animal house, although the writers sincerely try to be more with the accent on the issue of love between Carrey and Jennifer Aniston's character. but the effort falls flat.
There are big issues involved: purpose of living, relationships, theodicy. But these are lost in the anthropomorphic God, not in His portrayal by Morgan Freeman which is excellent, but in the anthropomorphic things he does and that Carrey does while he is playing God. There are the usual ridicule of religious belief: the golden calf on a table at a party, parting of the red tomato soup, water into wine, of course the obligatory walking-on-water. Again they're cute but nothing more, no real significance other than Morgan Freeman pointing out that the soup trick was a magic trick not a real miracle. The anthropomorphic God has to do with answering prayers for things, although the scene with Carrey on the roof outside of Aniston's room praying in more than a simple request for lottery tickets, a testimony to the writers desire to be something more than physical humor. Plus this god changes his own lightbulbs, and most importantly mops his own floors, along with a short speech by Freeman about the dignity of physical labor.
But what the movie is more about on the philosophic level is given in the two rules God imposes on Carrey: don't tell anyone you are god, and you can't do anything to control human freewill. There is a scene where Carrey tries to use god's power to make Aniston love him, but of course the power doesn't work under these conditions. The second hint is Freeman's last little speech to Carrey near the end about the need to exercise his own human power to get what he wants. This is the theme, God is a deus ex machina, a god-from-the-machine, nothing more than a cheap theatrical trick to pop up an anthropomorphic god who will bail human kind, or at least the hero who has gotten himself into trouble, out of their/his/our current mess. The human centered message is that life is important, the things you want are important since they are significant to you, whether love or a hot car or revenge on the block bullies or your competition at work. If you want them all you need to do if go after them, don't wait for some god-in-a-box, do it yourself. You've got the power. Carrey just screwed things up because he didn't know how to use this super-duper extended human godlike power, but he could learn, for it is nothing more than a quantity difference from normal human power to accomplish great deeds.
This is the essential message, god is just an exalted man, an anthropomorphic BIG GUY, his needs and powers are just extensions of our own. So use your powers to accomplish your ends, set your goals and achieve them. The usual humanistic religious themes.

1907596,5,B0000AKCKI,"Many movies that has God putting in an appearance have been dealt with on a superficial level, and most often, in intimate contact with just one person. Yes, there was James Mason's God in Heaven Can Wait opposite Warren Beatty,and Oh God with George Burns and John Denver. But let's tweak the formula and a Joan Osborne song: what if one of us became God? That's the question Bruce Almighty poses, and it pulls through with a charming, winning, and interesting take on the power of man and the power of God.
Bruce Nolan, working for WKBW, the local ABC affiliate in Buffalo, is forty and having a bit of a crisis. He's in charge of hosting the cute, inoffensive segments, as seen in the opening of a small bakery that breaks the record for the largest chocolate-chip cookie. He aspires to be an anchorman and is a more than just a bit upset when Evan Baxter, an obnoxious co-worker who pokes fun at Bruce, becomes the new anchor, replacing the retiring one. This puts a strain on his relationship with girlfriend Grace, a kindergarden teacher, which becomes tumultuous later.
After losing his job, he meets God, whom he has blamed for ignoring him, even shouting, ""The only one not doing his job is you!!""  To his surprise, God turns things over to Bruce and goes on holiday. Does God go on holiday, Bruce asks, to which the reply is, ""Ever hear of the Dark Ages?"" There are two conditions. One, he can't tell anyone. Two, he cannot override free will. However, Bruce uses/abuses his newly gained power for mostly personal gain, such as entertaining himself in a diner, cutting through a traffic jam, and getting even with some Latino toughs who gave him a going over after he gets fired. His getting even at Baxter during the latter's broadcast is the one scene I snickered at. It shows the inability of man to handle absolute power, but I won't mention that clich$B!&(Bhere.
There are some moments that are a bit too much. One are the songs that lamely remind us what the movie is. For example, after Bruce takes over, Snap's ""I've Got The Power"" kicks in. Later, he sings Joan Osborne's ""One Of Us"", you know, as in ""What if God were..."" And at the party, we hear Mick Jagger's ""God Gave Me Everything."" OK, we get the idea.
But what is this movie about, apart from Carrey's antics? I suppose it's knowing who we are, what our gifts are, but there's something else. Where does God's power end and human's begin? Also, what does a person really want? Is it what he/she wishes for in prayers? And do they pray because they feel they do not have the power and wherewithal to do it so they are waiting for that long hoped-for miracle? The fact that the movie poses these questions make this a success.
I'd given up on Jim Carrey since The Truman Show, but he's confounded me again. He is great here as Bruce Nolan, balancing that goofy smile and faces of his with someone who can be nice but has a lot of growing up to do, needing to find out what he wants or what his true self is. This is the first time I've seen Jennifer Aniston in anything, and as Grace, she pulls a winning and convincing performance. However, Morgan Freeman wins hands down as a kindly, patient, fatherly God, the sort who puts an arm on your shoulder and has a chat while walking together. And it even charmed an atheist like me, so go figure. Reviewed by Daniel Almighty.",1059955200,,3349,4.49016393442623

Bestowing Jim Carrey with godlike powers is a ripe recipe for comedy, and Bruce Almighty delivers the laughs that Carrey's mainstream fans prefer. The high-concept premise finds Carrey playing Bruce Nolan, a frustrated Buffalo TV reporter, stuck doing puff-pieces while a lesser colleague gets the anchor job he covets. Bruce demands an explanation from God, who pays him a visit (in the serene form of Morgan Freeman) and lets Bruce take over while he takes a brief vacation. What does a petty, angry guy do when he's God? That's where Carrey has a field day, reuniting with his Ace Ventura and Liar, Liar director, Tom Shadyac, while Jennifer Aniston gamely keeps pace as Bruce's put-upon fiance.

Jim Carrey has only really made one or two bad movies in his time but with classics such as 'ace ventura' and 'the truman show' under his belt i can see this becoming as high profile as those films as it is just as good and maybe even better in some ways. The film maintains the same ambient feeling throughout and there is no error with the acting or comedy, Jeniffer Aniston and Morgan Freeman deliver great performances throughout.
To some it up as briefly as i can the film is about a guy who keeps getting lousy reports for the news channel that he works for and everything keeps going downhill in his life so he shouts and curses god for not helping him then he meets god after numerous pager messages, gets to have gods powers for a set amount of time while god goes on holiday then Jim Carrey reaks havoc for most of the film, trust me you have to see it really it's hard to go into detail about the comedy involved and there is plenty.
One of the stand out parts in Bruce Almighty is when the news reporter speaks in a really high pitched strange way due to Bruce and his powers, so if you want to see the funniest comedy movie this year then this is bound to be up there with them.

1907602,5,B0000AKCKI,"Reluctantly taking on board certain styles of humour, procrastination leaves me with the only option when I am faced by a film, which casts the arguably proclaimed legend of Slapstick comedy  Jim Carrey.  I am surely not alone.  Carrey has a distinct connection with Marmite, a product generating a split in society through a Love Vs Hate barrier.  Ace Ventura; Mask; Cable Guy; Dumb and Dumber; Liar Liar; all left a lot to be desired in my opinion and yet I find myself encountered in debate with friends who obviously dislike Marmite (I personally love it!).  Through the despite lack of enthusiasm I hold for Mr Carrey, I have noticed his style harvesting and maturing into something fascinating.  We now see him taking on scripts, which I cant help think is something he truly feels connected with when the cameras are halted.  Carrey wants to be internally taken seriously, but is often pushed aside because of his blinding appearance which perceivers view as a juvenile type character with ephemeral antics that are almost out of steam.  Truman Show relates to my theory; Carrey taking on the more serious role and I agree, very good film plot, but Carrey was missing something and I cant put my finger on it, but he was far from spectacular. Until now of course
Jim Carrey was born to play the character of Brue Almighty, how often can you say that about an actor?  Frustrated with what life brings him, a job, which could open the door to the pinnacle of success, but yet Bruce feels trapped.  Feeling the unluckiest man alive, it is not surprising that Bruce finds comprehension a little hard to comprehend when confronted with God (Morgan Freeman). Luckily God has a sense of humour and will cast aside the many blasphemous comments Bruce has made to offer him a chance to play God.  With every opportunity of changing all his bad luck to good, Bruce faces the undeniable truth that he is his own worst enemy and that is the very reason he has had bad luck for so long.
The elements that will surely make this film a success will not solely depend on Mr Carrey either. Tom Shadyac (director) will now certainly be taking seriously in the film industry after pulling off some cleverly placed camera shots.  Another surprising performance was from Jennifer Aniston, clearly stamping down her mark on the film industry and has in my opinion been the most impressive out of the Friends cast.  Aniston has the calibre to play someone other than the character Rachel, unlike Matt Le Blanc and Lisa Kudrow respectively.  Morgan Freeman is as outstanding as ever, applying his usual captivation of on-screen appearance and utterly distinguishing voice.
Bruce Almighty will undoubtedly cause a storm.

""Bruce Almighty"" is yet another ""high concept"" comedy starring Jim Carrey, this time as a self-pitying, put-upon TV news reporter in Buffalo who finds himself endowed with all God's powers when the Almighty Himself decides to take a little vacation.
This material may seem tailor-made for Mr. Carrey's manic talents, but the makers of the film - screenwriters Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk, and director Tom Shadyac - have failed to discover any really innovative ways of approaching it.  When Bruce learns that he has the power to alter the world's reality at will, he spends most of his time playing foolish little parlor tricks on people who irritate him.  Carrey can still be wildly funny when the script calls for him to do that rubber-faced-and-bodied slapstick routine for which he is justly famous, but ""Bruce Almighty"" is not content to be a cynical, outrageous farce.  It also wants to be a ""meaningful"" love-thy-neighbor comedy, and falls down miserably in the process.  Morgan Freeman as God gets to do little but deliver high-toned, sappy homilies designed to make Bruce see the importance of the power that's been entrusted to him.  True to the formula - one that goes at least as far back as Frank Capra films in the 1930's - the film turns hopelessly mawkish and sentimental in its final third.  That would be forgivable had ""Bruce Almighty"" at least given us some cutting-edge outrageousness in its early stretches.
Jennifer Aniston exudes the requisite amount of charm as Bruce's devoted girlfriend, but the role is hardly one to challenge this obviously gifted young actress (see last year's ""The Good Girl"").  And there are a few moments when the filmmakers seem to have latched onto a clever or creative concept.  But those moments are quick to pass and, before we know it, we are once again mired in the predictability of yet another manufactured, by-the-numbers Hollywood product.  An additional problem with the movie is that it often defies the essential credibility that even an absurdist scenario such as this one demands.  At least twice in the film, for instance, a flipped out, ranting reporter is allowed to stay on the air long after any halfway competent news show producer would have pulled the proverbial plug on him.
If it weren't for the presence of the gifted Carrey, ""Bruce Almighty"" would seem like just another ""Bewitched"" episode expanded out to feature length.  Come to think of it, it feels that way anyhow.",1058400000,,2472,4.946859903381642

It comforms to the bible, and simplifies something that otherwise seems impossibly complicated: Why doesn't God just blaze out and prove his power? Make everyone love him? Theres your answer.

1907616,5,B0000AKCKI,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time.  Bruce Almighty starts Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, and Morgan Freeman.  The basic premise is this is a comedy about one man who is given the powers (and responsibilities) of God and we get to see what he does with this power.  Knowing that the movie stars Jim Carrey we expect quite a bit of over the top humor.  While we do have a fair amount of the typical Carrey humor, Bruce Almighty is a lot more than that.
Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a reporter for a local television station.  He gets the assignments that show off his warm and humorous side.  But Bruce wants the anchor position that will be opening up when the current male anchor retires.  Bruce does not feel that he is getting the respect or the opportunities necessary for him to be able to get the job he has always wanted.
Bruce is living with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), an elementary school teacher.  When Bruce loses his job (have a nice Jim Carrey fit) he blames everyone and everything including God for his mediocre life.  Grace sees that Bruce is also calling their relationship mediocre and is now upset with Bruce.  Bruce blames God some more, asks for a sign (he gets several, which he promptly ignores) until finally he realizes that there is something going on and actually meets God (Morgan Freeman).  God is tired of listening to Bruce whine so much so he tells Bruce that if he thinks he can do a better job at running the world, then perhaps Bruce should try.  God endows Bruce with the divine power and lets Bruce have a go at it.
Bruce does what most of us would do with the power of God.  He plays around with it for his own convenience, messes with the people who he doesn't like and uses it to help out his sex life with his girlfriend.  His use of power is very funny, but it appears that he is not happy with life.  Finally, Grace leaves him because even though Bruce is improving his life he has not changed who he is or how he acts to other people.
The movie changes gears and turns into a film about Bruce's redemption with God and with Grace.  The film presents a positive message about God and faith that does not feel heavy handed at all (the director happens to be Christian).  I thought this was a fairly well thought out and incredibly funny movie.  It is the funniest movie thus far this year and I would definitely recommend it.",1057708800,64,2411,4.391891891891892
1907617,4,B0000AKCKI,"This small, funny movie happens to resemble the life of Jim Carrey quite a bit...
Loopy features guy (think Ace Ventura, The Mask, Liar Liar) is popular with the public, successful, but yearns to do the hard news.
Gets shot at the hard stuff (think Man on the Moon, The Majestic).  Fails miserably.
Finds clarity.  Falls back to what he knows (hello 'Bruce Almighty').  Huge success follows.
There are a lot of funny moments in this film, and more than a couple of sly ones.  Two that stand out...
1. Morgan Freeman as God slipping in Carrey's signature ""Allllrighty then..."" line.
2. The female co-anchor ""Susan Ortega"" playing up her ethnicity with an overtly Hispanicized reading of her surname...""Orrrrrtega.""  That's classic.  It's happening in newsrooms all across the country and they nailed it to the wall here.  Hope people get this joke.  It's hilarious.
This is Jim Carrey's movie through and through.  Jennifer Aniston looks great as usual, but her presence is a mere afterthought.",1057536000,,993,4.96969696969697
1907618,2,B0000AKCKI,"""Bruce Almighty"" suffers from a surprising lack of ambition and creativity -- it's rare that a comedy about a man bestowed with God-like powers would stoop to segments as dumb as teaching one's dog to pee into a toilet, but there you have it. The opposite of outrageous, the movie actually strives to be humble: Were a human allowed to be God, they'd fix their own lives first, the world later, and, in the end, just plain stink at the job and admit defeat. It's a sweet sentiment, but not the kind of thing you'd figure to see in a Jim Carrey extravaganza.
Carrey is pretty bizarre as Buffalo TV reporter Bruce Nolan -- the performance is so self-aware and mugging you get the sense that Carrey's madness over being consigned again to cheap comedy after the weighty, overrated fare of ""Man On the Moon"" and ""The Majestic"" is just barely concealed under the surface. Nolan has a cool girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston, content to stand aside and say ""Ole!"") and a reasonable features reporter job at a good station, but he wants more: The anchor slot, and, in the subtext, the female anchor herself (Catherine Bell in bigtime, hotcha vamp).
Nolan loses the job to a creep (Steven Carell), learns about it just as he's about to go on the air and melts down in front of Buffalo. Carrey, as in the other ""rage"" scenes, is so convincing you wonder what this tortured man's nights must be like. Predictable chaos ensues after the meltdown, Nolan decides, pretty much out of the blue, to curse God for his ugly fate, upon which God, played by Morgan Freeman in a white suit, reveals himself, and charges Bruce with the almightyness of one Buffalo neighborhood. Bruce, shall we say, prefers party tricks and selfish perks to the more spiritual aspects of the vocation. Eventually, of course, he sees the light, accepts his limitations in life, and does President George W. Bush proud: He decides to settle for his small life, doing good, small deeds, leaving Important Things to Important People. ""Bruce Almighty"" is nearly a parable arguing classism.
Some of Bruce's vengeance pays off with laughs, the best being an eye-watering bit where he ruins the new creepy anchor career with gibberish and phony tele-prompter cues. But most of it is obvious and lame, and Carrey's longtime directorial collaborator Tom Shadyac (thrilled, I'm sure, to be back with Carrey after bombs with Robin Williams and Kevin Costner respectively) certainly brings no original flair to the table. Carrey dreamt up a few verbal riffs for the film and neither  ""it's good, it's good, it's good"" nor ""B-E-A-Utiful"" stand to make the bible of pop culture mimicry. Aniston is wasted in the teary-eyed, poor suffering saint role, while Philip Baker Hall must have needed some fast cash to park his grizzled mug in a movie like this.
Freeman is...nice; he actually gets Carrey to pay attention during their scenes together. Otherwise, Carrey is unleashed with all the fury that he bottled in during his recent drama stints. Problem is, the screenplays leaves him nowhere to go. It's entirely ordinary, even moralistic. If Jim Carrey's going to be God -- and you only get to be God once, pretty much -- might as well put some bang into it.",1057017600,,3198,4.783001808318264
1907619,5,B0000AKCKI,"From the previews I thought that Bruce Almighty would be extremely sacreligious, and since I am extremely religious, I was offended and opted to not see it. However, friends convinced me to give it a try after they watched it and found it to not be religious. Jim Carey plays Bruce Nolan, a Buffalo tv reporter who is tired of doing the small parts and dreams of the anchor job that his rival ""steals"" from him. He goes crazy on live tv and gets fired. He is so angry that he basically goes into a rage, blaming God for everything. He then receives a mysterious pager call from ""God"" he decides that Bruce needs to be taught a lesson, and gives him free reign of the ""Godly"" duties for a period of time. Of course, Bruce uses the power for his own good, and even tries to get the anchor job. This is not was God had in mind though, and Bruce screws a lot of things up, especially with his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston). In the end, Bruce discovers the true meaning of prayer and of helping people. The film is just a great film. It's not sacreligious and it doesn't push religion into your face.

1907620,4,B0000AKCKI,"What would you do if felt like a loser all your life and suddenly were imbued with all the divine power of G-d?  Would you give yourself a million dollars, answer all your prayers, or just run amok.  Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty has no qualms about using is power for good...his good that is.  After accusing G-d of being asleep at the wheel, Carrey is given the chance to sit in the big mans chair.  What ensues is grand hilarity and chaos.
There are, of course, many deeper lessons to this movie.  First, and foremost, G-d is not a cosmic Santa Claus who goes around granting wishes.  As we see with the scene where everyone wins the lottery because Bruce answers every prayer yes, everyone shouldn't have everything just handed to him.  Additionally, just because G-d does not answer a prayer ""yes"" does not mean he didn't answer it or that he didn't do so the right way.  The above two examples are lessons on faith and patience.  Additionally, though many conservative Christians likely will have an antagonistic opinion about the movie without ever having seen it, Morgan Freeman portrays a G-d that is pretty close to what Christian theology says about him.  For example, theology says that G-d, though being all powerful, cannot/will not do anything that violates his nature.  Since G-d allows us to have freewill, he can't force us into choosing anything, just like he can't force Bruce to be a good stand-in deity and just like Bruce can't force his girlfriend to love him.  There is a lot to find in this movie if you know where to look.
Of course, all three of the main actors (Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston, and Jim Carrey) do a superb job a filling their roles.  Carrey is believable as a person who has received G-d's powers - that is, he's selfish and (hilariously) bungling.  The soundtrack was equally good, particularly the Vertical Horizon song ""You're a G-d"" when Carrey is learning to cope with his problems the normal way.  The script was obviously well thought out.  A great flick you should see if you get the chance.",1056931200,,2046,4.657381615598886

1907622,4,B0000AKCKI,"After hearing next to nothing from Carrey for a while, he's back in Bruce Almighty.
Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is a reporter, working for a small-time news channel. He's sent out to events other reporters surely would frown upon, and turns the events into humorous. When we meet him, he's doing a piece on a gigantic cookie.
From then on, his life starts going downhill. He gets passed on a promotion to be Anchor Man for the network, he wrecks his car, his dog wets the chair again, he loses his job, gets beaten up, etc.
Bruce blames God for all the tragedy in his life, which inspires God (Morgan Freeman) to contact Bruce, and have Bruce fall in for him for a week. In other words, Bruce is left with all the powers God possesses, and God leaves for a well-deserved vacation. There are just two rules to follow when it comes to 'playing' God:
Bruce can't tell anyone he has Godly powers, and he's not allowed to go against the Free Will of the people.
Bruce immediately starts (ab)using the Powers to make his life a little better. He gets back on everything and everyone doing him wrong. He uses them to improve his love life and to make his girlfriend's (Jennifer Aniston) breasts slightly larger.
But playing God is not all about fun. There are prayers to be answered, and good to be done. Slowly but gradually, Bruce starts getting aware of this, as well as that you can't simply answer 'yes' to everyone's wishes.
When he loses his girlfriend over a fight, he's desperate to try and win her back, but the 'Free will' rule prevents him from using his powers to do so. It is then that Bruce starts realising what a tough job being God really is.
Freeman is extraordinary in his role of God, Carrey shines as Bruce, Steven Carell was simply amazing, the jokes are good, and the plot is (although predictable) a nice combination of humour, romance, and perhaps even a tiny part of making you see that no matter how bad things are going for you, there's always someone
off even worse.
Be sure to stay seated when the credits start rolling. You'll be granted a nice peek at some bloopers during these.",1056844800,,2098,4.494764397905759
1907623,5,B0000AKCKI,"Reluctantly taking on board certain styles of humour, procrastination leaves me with the only option when I am faced by a film, which casts the arguably proclaimed legend of Slapstick comedy - Jim Carrey.  I am surely not alone.  Carrey has a distinct connection with `Marmite', a product generating a split in society through a Love Vs Hate barrier.  Ace Ventura; Mask; Cable Guy; Dumb and Dumber; Liar Liar; all left a lot to be desired in my opinion and yet I find myself encountered in debate with friends who obviously dislike Marmite (I personally love it!).  Through the despite lack of enthusiasm I hold for Mr Carrey, I have noticed his style harvesting and maturing into something fascinating.  We now see him taking on scripts, which I can't help think is something he truly feels connected with when the cameras are halted.  Carrey wants to be internally taken seriously, but is often pushed aside because of his blinding appearance which perceivers view as a juvenile type character with ephemeral antics that are almost out of steam.  ""Truman Show"" relates to my theory; Carrey taking on the more serious role and I agree, very good film plot, but Carrey was missing something and I can't put my finger on it, but he was far from spectacular. Until now of course...
Jim Carrey was born to play the character of ""Brue Almighty"", how often can you say that about an actor?  Frustrated with what life brings him, a job, which could open the door to the pinnacle of success, but yet Bruce feels trapped.  Feeling the unluckiest man alive, it is not surprising that Bruce finds comprehension a little hard to comprehend when confronted with God (Morgan Freeman). Luckily God has a sense of humour and will cast aside the many blasphemous comments Bruce has made to offer him a chance to play God.  With every opportunity of changing all his bad luck to good, Bruce faces the undeniable truth that he is his own worst enemy and that is the very reason he has had bad luck for so long.
The elements that will surely make this film a success will not solely depend on Mr Carrey either. Tom Shadyac (director) will now certainly be taking seriously in the film industry after pulling off some cleverly placed camera shots.  Another surprising performance was from Jennifer Aniston, clearly stamping down her mark on the film industry and has in my opinion been the most impressive out of the `Friends' cast.  Aniston has the calibre to play someone other than the character `Rachel', unlike Matt Le Blanc and Lisa Kudrow respectively.  Morgan Freeman is as outstanding as ever, applying his usual captivation of on-screen appearance and utterly distinguishing voice.
Bruce Almighty will undoubtedly cause a storm.

1907624,4,B0000AKCKI,"""Bruce Almighty"" is a lot like Jim Carrey's other projects. Which isn't to say it isn't funny, but it is quite recycled and doesn't pun some of the things it could and should have. Now don't get me wrong, it is anything but boring, and anything but unfunny...but it is a lot like his other projects. A funny down-on-his-luck loser (""Dumb and Dumber"") gets a supernatural power (""The Mask""), and in the end wins back the girl (""Ace Ventura"") and makes a good name for himself (""Me, Myself and Irene"").
But in the same context, it is more clever and thought-provoking than his other projects.
Jim Carrey plays Bruce, a generally happy, soon-to-be-married man who desperately wants to be a news reporter. Unfortunately, he ends up being fired from his job, and when this happens, he curses God. The next day his pager beeps, and Bruce calls up the number. He is given instructions on where to drive to. He follows them and ends up finding God's temporary headquarters.
God is a black man (Morgan Freeman) surprisingly enough. I like Morgan Freeman, so I won't get into the racial technicalities. Anyway, God gives Bruce his powers for one week to see how well he can handle being the master of the earth, and immediately afterwards Bruce finds he has more than odd capabilities.
However, much is the case with most things, Bruce finds his world also shaken by his newfound powers. He has to answer prayers, for one thing, and his relationship with Grace (Jennifer Aniston) starts to suffer due to his ever-growing greed. In the end, Bruce starts to realize it's not so easy being God.
""Bruce Almighty"" is a very engaging, sweet, and harmless film, but like I said before, it is so much like Jim Carrey's other films that he seems to be making an Adam Sandler mould out of his career. One of the things I liked so much about ""Groundhog Day"" was how it showed what your average Joe would do given the power to repeat one day over and over and over again. ""Bruce Almighty"" has a very interesting and original plot, something uncommon for a comedy these days, but it unfortunately doesn't show Bruce using his newfound powers as much as he could have.
But regardless, the scenes where Bruce is experimenting not only entertain you, but actually make the time fly by. I really enjoyed this movie. It isn't exactly as great as it could have been, but I don't think that was the intention. Learning from their mistakes on ""The Majestic,"" Jim Carrey (and ""Bruce Almighty's"" filmmakers) achieved their goal of making a thoroughly entertaining, if somewhat repetitive film that doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't: A Jim Carrey movie. Yes, they could have made something more interesting, dramatic, serious and hilarious, but I don't think that's what the Jim Carrey audiences want, and I think that the filmmakers are smart, in a way, for paying attention to this.",1056585600,,2856,4.725450901803607

Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a newscaster whose life isn't the best, and he keeps complaining that God never gives him any breaks. Thus God (Morgan Freeman) shows up and endows Bruce with his powers, and Bruce uses these powers to his advantage and DISadvantage with hilarious and disastrous results. I knocked off half a star because sometimes the writers tried to get too much out of one joke (particularly when ""God"" is in the newsroom). But that doesn't change the fact that this movie is definitely worth seeing.

1907628,4,B0000AKCKI,"I certainly laughed until my sides hurt several times in this film (despite the fact it was not a WINGED monkey) and I can still at this relatively late date count on one hand the number of times that has happened (for the record the other three times were when the tanks came over the hill in ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" when Alvy Singer produced Marshall McLuhan in ""Annie Hall,"" and when Barbara Billingsley spoke jive in ""Airplane"").  Any film that can have you holding your sides to keep the pain from becoming too intense is a good thing (and not all of the super laughs are provided by Jim Carey, to our surprise).  You should already know by now if Jim Carey's brand of humor is to your liking, especially when he is team-up again with director Tom Shadyac (""Ace Ventura"" and ""Liar, Liar"").
Just do not try to work out the theological implications of the set up.  The movie, of course, makes no effort to hide the selling point of ""Bruce Almighty,"" which is that God (Morgan Freeman) gives Jim Carey (who plays a character named Bruce) divine powers.  The results are actually less spectacular than what happened in ""The Mask,"" because Bruce has a very short list of things we wants to accomplish (new car, better job, great sex).  Meanwhile, the new god on the block has no clue that his divine actions had repercussions: bringing the moon closer to earth to impress his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston, whose character also has a name in the movie that is something different from Rachel) has caused flooding on the far side of the earth, wiping out the homes of thousands of people.  The science of this makes no sense to me and the other obvious explanation, that those people flooded out in Asia were not Christians, is rather troubling.  But then so is the idea that Bruce's attitude adjustment, clearly a necessary thing, matters enough for God to allow the destruction of all those homes anyway.  After all, Bruce never really catches on that he is wrecking havoc around the world in general and Buffalo in particular and the only prayer he really listens to is one from his girlfriend.
However, none of this really matters during the course of the film while you are laughing yourself silly, and you should be well out into the parking lot before you start noticing such things.  Yes, the ending seems a bit reminiscent of ""Oh, God,"" but then the problem with most really great set ups is how to end on a high note.  Besides, the ending does not come as anything approaching a surprise and ""Bruce Almighty"" is more about the journey and creating laughs than anything else.  This might not be a classic comedy but it is a very funny movie.  What more do you want in answer to your prayers?",1055808000,,2700,4.590436590436591
1907629,4,B0000AKCKI,"The movie starring Jim Carey playing the role of a pathetic news reporter who's work had been taken from him by another promising tv reporter, which made him vent his anger towards God , feeling that the ""Almighty"" must be picking on him- he prattled his indignances questioning God about the unfairness that are going on in his life - thus, in turn God heard him and handed out some powers that enabled him to do just as whatever he pleased, thus goes the title BRUCE ALMIGHTY-- which turns out to be as quite a good allegorical flick about our frustrations when things are going wrong, or are not just coming around in our way of wanting things to happen.

The charachter of Jim Carey's dialects with the charachter of God played by Morgan Freeman is much worth than a week of sunday church services, answering some questions that come into mind whenever we suffer some bad breaks on our own. While the movie may be a comedy, it have well delivered itself from pointless profanity and have handled the humour well in the use of some  biblical stuff (like the parting of the red sea (you should see it)) in line with the context of its story. There are no ribald rudeness as far as the charachter of God is concerned- nor have it been profaned in anyway; and Jim Carey's angrily questioning God-doubting charachter, only goes well in line with the charachter he performs, as a person suffering his ordeals that he just can't understand the reasons why he is suffering such things.

Although it is a likely thing that the movie may still be criticized mainly by uppity type of 'christians' (though) who level much on the traditional norms of religiousity  as ""blasphemous"" even right before they see it- I just don't see the point myself of why they would categorize the movie as much, except for the untraditional means that the movie have in its presentation. What? The charachter of God being played by a black man? Who among us could tell whether He is a white man must have already seen God face to face! Which of course is an unlikely thing. I'm a Christ-believing Bible reader myself.

Watch the movie if you hadn't yet, and find out what we mean about the good merits that the movie has. And furthermore, this is what I could really consider (ironically to some) as a ""christian movie""- for it really carries a message that is truly relevant for our times in an appropriate biblical scope  perspectively. Unlike the popularized (and to my surprise church-accepted) so-called christian-tv siries titled ""Touched By an Angel""- that other than its unbiblical concepts (two women who are eventually angels doing stuff on the lives of people a-la ""Highway To Heaven"" starring the late Michael Landon) and good-for-nothing sappy scripts- it only dwells on nothing but religious sentimentalities which are pointless, and are capable enough to totally bore to death and turn off anybody who are alredy ticked off about the church community.

Likewise, its kind of discouraging that some christians themselves would tend to be predjudiced about some things which are more meaningful, while promoting another which is commonly acceptable but amounts to nothing as far as being sensible is concerned.
The bible even discourages this kind of behaviour  ""A person who answers a matter before he completely understood- to that man in his folly be a shame""  -Proverbs 18:13
We are not in a rightful possition to criticise someone or something, if we don't fully comprehend someone's intension, case, or means.
As in the words of Bob Dylan: ""Don't criticize what you don't understand"".

1907631,2,B0000AKCKI,"Don't get me wrong -- Morgan Freeman is superb, and Jennifer Anniston does the best she can with this script. Credit Freeman with bringing the perfect combination of wit and warmth to his role. But I was about to walk out of the theatre at least twice. This rendition of the ""supernatural intervention to make you appreciate what you have"" script (done most recently by Nicolas Cage in ""The Family Man"", in 2000) offers nothing original.
If you like Jim Carrey, you may enjoy his performance here. He really is wonderful as a struggling news feature reporter, covering fluff stories. The film falls flat because it tries to combine slapstick comedy -- in one scene, the God-like Carrey forces the news anchor to make goofy vocalizations for what seems like an interminable 2 minutes -- with religious preaching. ""It's not easy to be God."" ""People have to love of their own free will."" ""Be nice to people."" ""Think about other people before yourself.""
If you already knew this, you can always giggle as Carrey gets run down by a big rig, drives his car into a light pole or (hee hee) steps in a big puddle. I'm astounded this kind of writing makes it into movies.
As if all of this cliche-laden writing isn't enough, we are treated to a boy-loses-girl, boy-learns-lesson, girl forgives everything, boy-gets-girl-back happily-ever-after ending. All along, most people are going to wonder why Jennifer Anniston is living with a second-rate news reporter, why he isn't interested in her, and so on.
If you're a Jim Carrey fan, none of this may matter. You will probably get a few laughs out of 'Bruce Almighty,' if for no other reason than Carrey's spastic acting style lives on here. If anyone can pull off the 'get hit by a semi' or 'step in a puddle' gags and make them work, it really is Carrey. He has some smile-inducing moments as the newsman covering a giant cookie bake and other local news-type features. But don't expect much more.
I tried to like this movie, but it takes itself too seriously for what it is. In contrast, even Spielberg's 'Catch Me If You Can,' (Leondaro DiCaprio/Tom Hanks/Christopher Walken)which isn't exactly high drama, seems to bask in its lightheartedness. 'Bruce Almighty' wants to be a sermon, a cartoon and a love story all at once. Despite some great work by Freeman, it doesn't work.",1055635200,,2319,4.7711442786069655

1907645,3,B0000AKCKI,"The concept behind ""Bruce Almighty"" is a universally appreciated one. What would you do if you could be God?
Much of the enjoyment of ""Bruce Almighty"" comes out of watching Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) do just that, and we get to live vicariously through him. While that concept is enjoyable, the filmmakers failed to fully realize the possibilities. The film starts with a wonderful premise and ends up becoming a clichd and predictable romantic-comedy/after-school-special-lesson movie.
When Nolan's life begins to go down the tubes and blames God, he gets the chance of a lifetime. He's God while the real guy in white goes on vacation. So what does Nolan do with his newfound power? He does what anyone red-blooded human would do and abuses it. Sure it leads to some great scenes early on in the film - none of which I will spoil here ? but the film seems to gloss over so much of where it could have gone. What if he had goofed up and granted prayers that never should have been granted? What if that one prayer he answered caused cataclysmic events and he had to solve the situation. What about the moral dilemmas that could result from having ultimate power? These are all just some ideas I thought would have been great to explore in the film. Just think of all the great comical events that could have happened with them. But the filmmakers instead took the old and clichd route of ""boy has girl, boy looses girl, boy tries to get girl back."" Now why would you resort to that tired route when you're in the middle of a greater story about becoming God?
Perhaps I'm being too hard on ""Bruce Almighty."" It was enjoyable and had several great moments. It just could have been a lot better then just another Jim Carrey movie. It could have been, but wasn't. I'm sure I'll get some heat for this review, but that's all right. If you want to click that this review wasn't helpful just because I shared my honest reaction, go ahead. But at least I offered an explanation for why I was disappointed with this flick.
If you love Jim Carrey movies, I?m sure you?ve already seen it, and if not you will probably love it. But if you're unsure on whether or not to see ""Bruce Almighty,"" just wait till it hits video. In a summer saturated with many ""must see"" films, this one doesn't really have anything that won't be just as enjoyable in your own living room six months from now.",1055462400,,2373,4.508120649651972

1907647,5,B0000AKCKI,"Firstly, I have to say I love this movie.  I love movies which are both entertaining and inspiring; and Bruce Almighty is certainly one of this type.  Jim Carrey delivers his usual comicalness and is working hard to exert some seriousness.  I beleive he has been diligent over the past few years, trying to upgrade himself to be more than just a comic actor.  He did well in his last few movies - Liar Liar, Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majesty, but this one is a real breakthrough for him.
Director Tom Shadyac seems to make good chemistry with Jim.  Tom has been making good commercial movies (Dragonfly, Liar Liar, The Nutty Professor, Patch Adams, etc.) with some serious messages.
Of course, there are Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston - all in the list of my favorite movie stars....
My kids enjoy the funny part, and for me, I of course enjoy very much the serious and touching bits towards the end of the movie.

1907650,5,B0000AKCKI,"A Hollywood movie that treats God reverently and extols the importance of prayer while using A-list actors and managing to be funny? It'd be easier to find the Loch Ness Monster, right? Well, it was. Then -- on Memorial Day, 2003 -- Tom Shadyac released Bruce Almighty.
The latest vehicle for Jim Carrey, Bruce Almighty delivers a series of punchlines while exploring theological truths in a serious manner. The Bible encourages us to be content in all circumstances and the TV news reporter played by Jim Carrey is anything but content with his life at the movie's outset. Despite his successes, in comparison to others he finds himself lacking and blames the shortcomings on God.
His redemption comes from being endowed with God's powers, not because of the power he gains, but because of the insight it gives him into the life of others. Bruce -- along with the movie audience -- understands the interconnectedness of the human race when he tries to exercise his new powers. He realizes that when one person gets the promotion, someone else doesn't, and if everyone wins the lottery it's not worth much.
The movie is from Hollywood, not Christendom, so the movie isn't entirely family-friendly or doctrinally pure. However, it is a hysterically funny film that treats the Christian faith with respect...and that's pretty rare from Hollywood.",1055030400,10,1344,5.004464285714286

1907652,4,B0000AKCKI,"Jim Carrey is back on top in BRUCE ALMIGHTY, a silly but oddly entertaining comedy, which falls short on laughs, but comes out big on entertainment.
It definitely has an intriguing and original premise, executed quite nicely, with superior effects and great peformances. Carrey is his usual self, but it works once again! Back are the days of ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""The Mask"", although here he plays an average joe with an average life. The crude humor is plentiful, but Bruce is more likable than any character Carrey has played before, including those in the more recent ""Truman Show"" and ""The Majestic."" He brings a certain charm to Bruce that was missing from his previous roles. Though not as impressive as last year's Good Girl, Jennifer Aniston is terrific as Carrey's girlfriend, bringing Rachel's bright persona to her big-screen role. She certainly lights up the screen and has wonderful chemistry with Carrey.
Bruce Almighty is a sweet, good-natured comedy with dramatic elements and a few life lessons learned. It's fun, mindless entertainment amidst the bigger budgeted summer blockbusters.

1907653,4,B0000AKCKI,"What happens when God gives a whining, complaining ordinary Joe his powers?  ""Bruce Almighty"" attempts to answer that question, with Jim Carrey playing Bruce Nolan, the whining, complaining ordinary Joe.  And Carrey has a field day with the character, delivering some of his funniest stuff yet, which include a tyrade on a newscast from Niagra Falls and making his rival newsman speak in gibberish.  Jennifer Aniston does well in her first mainstream role as Nolan's girlfriend Grace, and Morgan Freeman never takes his God role too seriously, which adds an extra layer of humor to a movie already chock full of Carrey's physical gags.
Nolan (Carrey) is a reporter at a Bufallo news station, buts what he really wants to be is an anchorman.  But when his rival takes the job instead, and he loses his job because of his tyrade at Niagra Falls, he gets fired and starts to get on God's (Freeman) nerves because of his complaining.  All the while, he is starting to neglect his girlfriend Grace (Anniston).  But God hears Bruce's complaints and bestows his powers on him.  Carrey thinks all his problems are now solved as he now becomes known as Mr. Exclusive because he makes it so he covers amazing, freak stories, like a metorite hitting Earth.  Although, Bruce soon finds out that his new found fame is taking him away from what he really enjoys, i.e. grace, and he is going to lose all that if he does not change himself and how he acts.
And that is the film's moral: instead of asking for everything, you have to get off your butt and do it yourself, and think about people other than yourself.  Despite the occasional corny moment, director Tom Shadyac (Who collaborated with Carrey on ""Liar, Liar"") still manages to lend enough gravity and emotion to the message, and makes a wholly satisfying conclusion to a movie that will make your sides split, as well as make you rethink the way you go about life.",1054684800,14,1909,4.691616766467066
1907654,5,B0000AKCKI,"After Liar,Liar, Jim Carrey started to veer over in the lane of drama, starting with The Truman Show and then The Majestic. In those two films, Jim Carrey looked like he lost his comedic presence and tried so hard to be dramatic, but never would work. Now, he's come back in Bruce Almighty and has shown us that he still has to comedy in him. Although this movie was absolutely hilarious, I still feel that Liar,Liar is his best, but this ranks right up there in Carrey's best films.
The movie is about a news reporter named Bruce Nolan, who's striving for the position of being anchorman on his news station. His career in being anchorman isn't looking like its about to happen, because one bad thing after another starts to happen to him, which he soon blames on God. After all these bad things happen to him, God finally gives him an answer and endows him with all of his powers. It's a hilarious movie from beginning to the end, showing us that Jim Carrey is back in his comedy role and that he can still do it. The acting was good and the jokes were not stale. There is one thing I find kind of weird, is when Jennifer Aniston sees the dog using the toilet in the bathroom. She doesn't do anythign except raise her eyebrows in curiosty and simpy leave the room. If your looking for a good time at the movies then check this movie out.

When Nolan curses God, Morgan Freeman shows up in the role of God, to give Nolan some of his power so he can see what being God is like. Jennifer Aniston plays Carrey's girlfriend and she is a great actress for the role.

I just wished this movie had been more ""kid friendly"". There are many adult situations really not suitable for kids. Including the fact that Bruce Nolan and his girlfriend are sleeping together without the benefit of marriage. So don't expect a ""religious"" movie with any moral value. Its pure comic entertainment.

The people looking for the usual Jim Carrey humor will not be dissapointed, as he gets to let loose in afew scenes and remind us why he is one of the more sucessful comedians in film of all time. The audience looking for a comedy with a good message and something their kids can see won't be dissapoined either. While this film does have some adult humor, it is still a good movie for kids to see. Jim Carrey is very funny, although he has been more funny, in films like Liar Liar and Dumb and Dumber. It's not his fault as much as it is he shares the spotlight with other people and acts more serious at the end. Morgan Freeman is the first actor to nail the role of God, as he just reflectss wisdom and grace. Jennifer Aniston also does surprisingly well as Bruce's long suffering girlfriend. This film delivers all the good and is much better than sucessful comedies released this year, such as Bringing Down The House and Anger Management. it is great to see Carrey do what he does best: Make People Laugh!",1054512000,,1077,4.36318407960199
1907666,4,B0000AKCKI,"After starring in two duds - the lackluster ME, MYSELF & IRENE and the awful sentimental tripe THE MAJESTIC - Jim Carrey is back in top comedic form and better than ever before in BRUCE ALMIGHTY.  Although the film is far from perfect (the last 20 minutes are really bad), it's Carrey's funniest movie since LIAR LIAR, which is still his best comedy to date, and the hilarity of some of the standout scenes alone are worth the price of admission.
Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter for Channel 7 news in Buffalo who is sick and tired of doing second-rate stories and wants to become the head male anchor at the network.  Bruce always never liked his life and even moreso on this day.  During the 24 hours, he loses his dream anchor job to a slimy rival named Evan(Steve Carrell), gets jumped by a Mexican gang, crashes his car, and his dog constantly pees on his furniture.  His only source for comfort is his live-in girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), but even Bruce lashes out on her about his/their ""mediocre life.""  Bruce then lashes out at God, claiming that He is the source for all his problems.
Then the next day, God himself (in the form of Morgan Freeman) calls Bruce and has a meeting with him in an abandoned building.  God gives Bruce his almighty powers while He goes on vacation, daring him to do a better job than he does.  Bruce agrees, but like any human being, he uses his powers to get back at his enemies and get everything he wants.  Of course, he soon learns that being God isn't all it's cracked up to be...
The premise of the movie is very clever.  What if you were to play God for a week?  That is what anybody wishes to be.  The funniest scenes in the film occur during the first hour, which is consistently funny throughout.  The scene where Bruce gets back at Evan while live on the air is hysterical, and the running joke involving the dog using the toilet is very funny as well. But the most hilarious scene is when Bruce, finding out that Evan got the anchor position while live at Niagara Falls, goes out on a tangent and unleashes his fury on TV.  He ends his rant on a profane note, and it perfectly showcases what Carrey is capable of.
For the most part the movie is funny, but the film stops dead in its tracks during the last 20 minutes or so, which is slow, dull, and painfully sentimental.  The director of this movie also directed PATCH ADAMS, which is one of the worst movies ever made and you all know how ""weepy"" that was.  The end of BRUCE ALMIGHTY definitely reaches those levels and instead of delivering their message on a positive note, they went the corny direction (which is why I took one star off).  That's my only real complaint.  Everyone else is good.  Morgan Freeman is very funny as God and has a couple of great one-liners and Jennifer Aniston is a sweetheart, not to mention Steve Carrell who is the perfect foil for Carrey and his mannerisms.
BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a nicely done comedy and one of the few Hollywood comedies out there that's actually funny.  It deserves every bit of its success.",1054512000,,3056,4.444444444444445

Great idea by the writers of this movie.  Also, nobody in Hollywood could have pulled off playing the main character other than Jim Carrey.
This movie had me roaring time and time again.  The only problem I had with it was Carrey was a little bit Ace Ventura from time to time. What I mean by that, is he was a little too unrealistic in some of his characters exaggerations.  Most of them were really funny, but it was a little much.  I don't mean to pick this movie apart because it was great.  I hope Carrey sticks to the comedic roles, and doesn't ventura into the other kind of films he's been doing as of late.",1054339200,3,763,4.220689655172414
1907670,3,B0000AKCKI,"I've been a fan of Jim Carrey since his ""In living Color"" days...and I've followed his movie career very closely.
""Bruce Almighty"" is a bit of a let-down.  Sure, it was nice to see Jim back in his zany role...but even then he seemed to be forcing things...which I find true of the entire movie...it all seems a bit forced and lacks any real ~flow~.
Perhaps this has to do with the completely cliche and predictable script.  It's hard to believe that the same Director who put Jim in a such a good place with ""Liar Liar"" and ""Pet detective"" could let his pal down so hard with this one.
The other issue I have is with some folks saying that this was Carrey's ""return to form"" in terms of his crazy comedy bits.
Did these people not see ""Me myself & Irene""?  In my opinion, that movie is light years ahead of ""Bruce Almighty"" in terms of execution...and it was only two years ago!
Not a bad Jim Carrey movie...but not a great one either.

It might even delve into preachy in parts, but it does have quite a few laughs.  It seems that Carey is slowly trying to evolve (or devolve) into a serious actor.  I am not sure it is believable just yet.  Perhaps a cameo in Saving Private Ryan II is just the boost his career needs.
Any movie that is set in Buffalo is a gem. Well exept that one with Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn, uhhh.  Also, it is too bad that Carey's charachter did not run into anyone from MTV's sorority house, alas.  Of course the most unbelievable part was when the Sabre's won the cup.

How often are we lured to the theatre by hilarious trailers, only to discover that the rest of the movie pretty much stinks (OLD SCHOOL, HEAD OF STATE, VIEW FROM THE TOP, etc. etc....this year alone!)??
BRUCE ALMIGHTY doesn't disappoint. Even the stuff in the previews is still funny in the context of the movie.  I don't think I need to rehash the plot.  It's very straightforward, and a great vehicle for Jim Carrey.  And he doesn't disappoint.  He's in fine form, combining his character from LIAR, LIAR with a smidgen of Ace Ventura and Cable Guy to give him an edge.
Carrey, according to stories written about this movie, is an extreme perfectionist, often driving co-star Jennifer Aniston crazy with his demands for more and more takes.  Thank goodness he's demanding.  Sure, maybe in ""real life"" he's a jerk, but at least he still knows what's funny!!!  There were three or four times where I was laughing SO HARD that tears were forming.  No exagerration.  My wife had to wipe her eyes numerous times.  There's low humor: a street-hardened thug tells Bruce, whom he offended earlier in the movie, ""I'll apologize when monkeys come out of my butt.""  Well, as he soon discovers, this is not a statement you want to make to a guy with God's powers!  Is the idea gross?  You bet.  Is it funny?  My God, it's even funnier than one would think possible.  Yet, there are also plenty of sly jokes, clever site gags (much fun is had with post-it notes) and social/political commentary.
Carrey is funny.  That's good enough reason to see the movie.  But fortunately, Jennifer Aniston provides very game support as his long-term girlfriend (she isn't really given funny stuff to do, but she's a perfect foil for him) and Morgan Freeman is better than he's been in awhile playing God...his God has a twinkly sense of humor, but just a tiny hint behind the easy going demeanor that you really don't want to mess with the Lord Almighty!
Sure, the ending of the movie gets a bit mushy and ""Hollywood,"" but quite frankly, the movie has worked harder than most to earn those ""tear-jerking"" moments, and they are quite endurable.  Also, don't leave right away, there are some amusing outtakes during the closing credits.
Finally, the PG-13 rating.  There are some mild sexual situations, and the whole ""monkey sequence"" but I had my 10 year old with me and didn't feel uncomfortable...and I'm usually a prude when it comes to those things.  So I would say this is a ""soft"" PG-13 film.  BY ALL MEANS SEE IT!!!",1054166400,,2634,4.690631808278867

1907674,5,B0000AKCKI,"In Bruce Almighty, Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a news reporter who thinks that God is against him. For instance, a jerk at the news station gets Bruce's coveted position of news anchor, Bruce is attacked by a gang, his dog pees on everything (Unless it's outside), and he crashes his car into a lamppost.
Bruce overlooks the fact that he is still well loved by his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Aniston, and Bruce goes on a mad verbal abuse rampage.
""God is the mean kid on the anthill with the magnifying glass, and I'm the ant."" You get the idea. Basically, God (played by Morgan Freeman) comes down to earth in human form, and gives Bruce his powers. He basically does a whole ""You don't like the way I do things, so see how you like doing it,"" sort of thing.
Bruce acts like any kid would act and uses his powers to get himself popularity, take revenge on the jerk who stole his job, and toilet-train his dog (quite funny).
Bruce then starts to realize that being God is harder than it seems. This movie is hilarious and it will keep you laughing and shouting for more. The first two parts of the movie are hilarious, but the third part is unusually serious.
Other than that, watch that movie.

1907675,5,B0000AKCKI,"I thought everything was handled with incredible comedic timing.  The first half of the movie the audience was laughing about every 20 seconds.  Jim Carrey did a fantastic job and played his role differently (but still very funny) than in movies such as The Mask, Ace Venturas, Liar Liar, Me Myself and Irene, Dumb and Dumber, Truman Show, and Batman.  His facial expressions were perfect.  Jennifer Aniston was great, and so was Morgan Freeman.  There were a few more serious moments partway through the film, but with quick ""recoveries"".  And yet, I believe, the serious moments were written extremely well.
So on to who wouldn't like this film and who would, based on approaches to faith in God.  If you do believe in a God, and try to conform to what you believe that God wants from you, you may or may not like this movie.  It shows God in a way I know I hope God would be - very compassionate and good-humored, but some might be upset by the portrayal of limited power (not just free will, but being overwhelmed by prayers).  Some might not like that God would give his powers to someone who used those powers at times to beat up bad guys and glance up skirts once (could have been worse, though - absolute power is supposed to corrupt absolutely and Bruce was selfish but somewhat reasonable).  If you don't believe in a God, I think the humor of the film and the magical ""what if"" will be most enjoyable.  If you subconsciously or consciously do believe in a God but are not doing what you think that God requires, part of this film may be unpleasant for you.
I'm glad Jennifer Aniston and Jim Carrey didn't get very physical.  They were believable as a couple, but not too physical.  I thought the movie was sweetly romantic even without physical involvement.  Better that way.  I'd like to see Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston stay happily married, so kudos to everybody who came up with the physical limit.  Jennifer was wonderful and very pretty too!

Catherine Bell  ...News anchor
 BRUCE ALMIGHTY has gotten mixed reviews so I approached it cautiously. I needn't have worried. The audience in the matinee screening I attended roared with laughter. Jim Carrey is back, funnier than ever.
 This fluffy comedy is sent in the environs of Buffalo, NY, where Jim Carrey's character Bruce toils as a newscaster for a local TV station, where he pines for the anchor desk, but due to his innate comedic talent is often sent to cover the sorts of ""human interest"" stories his colleagues wouldn't be caught dead doing. You know, the ones where he has to don a ridiculous costume and interview some clueless soul. In short, no matter how much he tries to get hard news assignments no one takes him seriously. (Like Carrey's movie career?)
 One day it seems Bruce's broadcasting dreams have come true. His boss sends him out on a much-coveted ""live feed"" -- only to discover on getting to the location that it involves putting on a silly hat to go out under Niagara Falls in a boat so he can get soaked to the skin while he tries to carry on a conversation with a dour centenarian. Just before the feed starts he learns on-air that he has been passed over for the coveted anchor position - and Bruce goes postal, as only Jim Carrey can. This naturally results in his losing his job, and things soon get worse, for in the same day he gets beaten (defending a homeless man), wrecks his car after asking God for a ""sign"" (ignoring the ones that pop out right before him), and nearly wrecks his relationship with his girlfriend Grace (played by Jennifer Aniston). Oh, and his dog still wants to pee on his favorite chair. The only bright spot in this Job-like catastrophe is that his pager still works, even after being run over by a car after he throws it out on the street. Intrigued, he picks it up. But on answering its summons to a dingy warehouse he meets a deity who doesn't lightning-and-thunder him into submission but rather offers him a job.
 Morgan Freemen portrays the Almighty, or rather, as I like to think of it, ""God Lite"": a fatherly figure who doesn't smite but patiently tries to get his creation's attention. The surprise is that Morgan plays God not only with his trademark gravitas but with a touch of humor. His droll wit plays well against Carrey's frantic capering. We first see Him as a janitor who sends Bruce to the man upstairs, then as the electrician on the top floor who reveals himself as the Man Upstairs. There are similar quasi-religious touches in the setting (Omni Presents), score and other details in the movie, never getting too preachy or sectarian.
 After a bit with a file drawer that may remind baby boomers of the ""bread"" gag from I LOVE LUCY, Bruce gets an offer he won't refuse. God gives him the use of his powers for a week- ""You think you can do it better, here's your chance."" At first Bruce, flummoxed, can hardly believe it - until he parts his soup like the Red Sea. (I kept waiting for Charlton Heston's voice to intone ""Behold, His mighty Hand"") Once he realizes ""he's got the power"" he goes a little crazy with it, using it to get back his career, his car, fixing things with his girlfriend and his dog. The results are hilarious. But no matter how powerful Bruce is, he can't do two things: make anyone love him or tell anyone about it. Once things are going good again it's his self-centeredness that lands him in the doghouse with Grace - and he finds he can't do a thing about it.
 Needless to say lessons are learned and repentance is achieved (even if it's not called that). Bruce, now appreciating what he has, gets back his life, and he finds that it IS a wonderful life (with more than one nod to that film), even if it's not the one he dreams of...",1053907200,15,3915,4.55982905982906

1907684,4,B0000AKCKI,"Your reaction to this movie will depend on your expectations, it is neither ACE VENTURA nor THE MAJESTIC. The movie OH GOD had John Denver as the earnest nonbeliever and straightman for the comic George Burns as a playful God. BRUCE ALMIGHTY reverses the typecasting; it has the wild and wacky Jim Carrey as the playful and irreverent reporter Bruce Nolan who is suddenly given the powers of The Almighty, played with wonderfully understated grace and perserverance by Morgan Freeman. The story is simplicity itself, Jim Carrey is a TV reporter with a real talent for doing human interest stories with a humorous twist, but who feels underappreciated and yearns for a spot on his Buffalo NY station's anchor desk. His longtime girlfriend Grace Connelly (played by Jennifer Aniston) also feels somewhat taken for granted, since Bruce seems to be more concerned about his career than their relationship. The stresses in Bruce's life suddenly converge when he is fired from his job after a disastrous (and hilarious) live interview conducted on THE MAID OF THE MIST while under Niagara Falls. Never particularly religious despite his girlfriend's entreaties to seek comfort from prayer, in a defiant gesture Bruce totally rejects all belief in the possibility of any help from God. Supposedly summoned by pager to a job interview, in a wonderful encounter with incredible symbolism (an all white environment with a black God) Morgan Freeman endows Bruce with the powers of THE ALMIGHTY and challenges him to do a better job while obeying only two seemingly simple rules. Then the fun, adventure and suddenly changed trajectory of Bruce's life begins.
If you want to see Jim Carrey at his comic best, you will love this movie. Imagine what he can do and the havoc that he can create as THE ALL POWERFUL with almost no limitations on his abilities. (The trailers accurately relect this aspect of the film.) Where the movie disappoints in my opinion was its use of comedy to explore the issues which it raises about religion and its role in our lives, personal relationships, pursuit of happiness, and feelings of accomplishment. As you can imagine, Bruce at first refuses to believe that he has been endowed with extraordinary powers, then initially uses them for mundane personal purposes in several really funny incidents. After a few additional visits and consultations with Morgan Freeman, Bruce gradually comes to accept the fact that being almighty is more complicated and involves more responsibility than simply creating personal gratification. The next lesson also involves the fact that there are often unintended consequences which stem from good (as well as bad) intentions; one person's good fortune may cause problems for someone else. Despite the serious undertone, the comedic aspects of the incidents inevitably dominate the storyline.
While comedy can be a wonderful way to enlighten as well as entertain, in many instances this film instead opts for complete farce. This aspect combines with the fact that many of the miracles are more like cheap magic tricks rather than almighty acts to lessen the potential of the film to be truly thoughtprovoking. (It also means that regardless of which faith you espouse, if you have strongly fundamentalist religious beliefs you may be offended by some aspects of this movie.) There were some great issues raised, but always implicitly with the exception of the role of free will; it appears that the filmmakers kept their story very bland to reamin as inoffensive as possible; but that seems at odds with a story about a man and his encounter with THE ALMIGHTY.
This was an interesting movie that I want to see again to test my first reaction. I enjoyed the humor immensely; I watched it in a crowded theater and the entire audience laughed hysterically at times. Morgan Freeman was superb in a limited although central role, and Jennifer Aniston was perfect as the frustrated girlfriend. The dog was a lovable character as well. TWO IMPORTANT NOTES: first, don't leave when the credits start rolling, there are some subsequent great outtakes; second, pay particular attention to the signs held up periodically by Jack Jozefson (the homeless man) - they are not only wonderfully apropos but one of the methods by which the message of the story is subtly, if only silently, conveyed. So while I highly recommend this film, my four star rating relects the fact that the attempts to play for comedy and blandness kept it far from what could have been its six star potential.",1053820800,2,4526,5.027962716378163
1907685,3,B0000AKCKI,"In tribute to how bad this movie was, I didn't laugh for the first half hour. In another tribute to how bad this movie was, not even the outtakes were funny. In traditional style Jim Carry parades across the screen with his brand of humor. What's intriguing about this movie is how his character and natural ability would bring out the humor when combined with the power of God. Yes, it's an indulgence surely common to all humans. That 'WhatIf' of life, what if I had the power to do this, to create that... and on a level Bruce Almighty suceeds in that arena, succesfully drawing on some emotion and creating the conundrum in that simply being endowed with power in and of itself does not connote wisdom or the ability to solve the problems of the world. This is illustrated well in the movie and comes off only slightly preachy, which I don't mind considering the heady material being covered anytime one approaches a subject like what is it to be God. But that's where this movie gets you; it doesn't know whether to be a drama or a comedy. Uncomfortably tense moments only midly soothed by comedic highlights and the worst part is that the funniest bits of this movie only occur because of the God power, not because of any great part of Jim Carry or the horrible writing behind this script. It's almost as if every gag has to be followed up be outrageous humor in order to 'make' the gag itself funny. Potentially a great movie, it is marred by a bad script, a lack of focus and direction, and a lack of the genuine touch of the 'divine spark'.",1053820800,,1550,4.442105263157894

1907687,5,B0000AKCKI,"BRUCE ALMIGHTY marks the return of Jim Carrey to his ideal type of movie- a more highly evolved film reel than what was represented by his Ace Ventura days but something less than an all-out assault to build a souped-up vehicle powerful enough to win that cutthroat annual race for the coveted gold statue bearing the name of a green garbage-loving grouch who lives on a street named Sesame; this isn't a pet detective, this isn't a dramatic biopic of a deceased comedian (not that there was anything necessarily wrong with either of those approaches, it should be noted).  What BRUCE ultimately ends up being is a complete mainstream production, ready and approrpriate for a wide demographical spectrum, an escape into benign cinematic trappings which nevertheless succeeds in differentiating itself from the rest of its genre clan by benefiting from one of the best scripts of its kind.
Carrey is Bruce Nolan, a middling reporter for the local news station trapped in a hellish state where maximum potential for career advancement has been prematurely reached.  He's sick to death of being obligated to cover such puff pieces as the biggest cookie ever to be baked; such banal Americana is beneath him now, he wants to stretch his wings and score the prime anchor spot next to the curvaceous and comely Susan Ortega, played by the lovely Catherine Bell.  When he is passed over for that spot- given to his arch nemesis, one of those annoying coworkers who always gets what someone else deserves because that's just the way the politics of life play out- he has a nervous breakdown and gets into a heated argument with his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston).
There is another, more important argument, however- Bruce spews forth an incendiary blast of invective towards old Alpha himself, God.  Morgan Freeman brings the Good Lord to life, and he brings Bruce to his office to have a few words with him.  So, you think this is easy, Bruce?  You think you've been slighted and that I'm the cause of all your problems?  How about this...I take a long overdue holiday and you can be in charge of things while I'm gone.  How does that sound?  Well, of course it sounds great.  After Bruce gets through the initial excitement of looking up pretty girls' skirts and parting a sea of automobile traffic like he was a commuting Moses, he sets about getting his reporting career back on track (a mighty fast and furious one, to be sure); he also attempts to impress his love Grace with his newfound powers.  Soon, however, his messianic honeymoon is over; as Peter Parker's gentle Uncle Ben once advised his superhero nephew, great power demands an even greater sense of responsibilty.  Being God is a metaphysical coin, and we all know that a coin always has two sides; when that other, darker side starts to reveal itself, Bruce realizes that, in reality, he's only human after all, and he seeks counsel with his new mentor.
BRUCE is, to one degree or other, a masterpiece; in a sense, it is an Oscar caliber film which got that way because it didn't try to be pretentious.  Inarguably, its first and foremost goal was to be an uplifting morality tale told through the cloned filter of a Liar Liar-type mechanism; it was that, certainly, but, as previously implied, it transcended to another level by virtue of the ubiquitous skill present within the words and ideas expressed on the screen...the writing was, simply put, surreal in its quality.  Many will take that as an overblown statement, and perhaps such a declaration is indeed a bit too colorful and grandiose; yet, there was an eerie perfection in the balance of the story, an equilibrium in play which saw every character and concept receive just the right amount of attention.  And the concepts offered supported a philosophical base which was as poignant as it was entertaining.
A fascinating observation to make about the piece is its essential existence as a binary entity; there is a clear bifurcation seen whereby two different tonalities share equal importance- what starts out as a manic, extreme comedy of slapstick circumstance evolves almost imperceptibly into a dramatic examination of life and love and their respective vagaries.  Many films of this kind follow a similar template, of course, but the stytlistic expression in this case was handled with uncommonly accomplished technique.  What makes everything work so well- besides the direction and the script- is the perfect casting job, especially of the principals; Carrey is the only person who coud play Bruce, and Freeman is one of the only people who could take on the hardest role ever conceived (other people could be thought of for God, since the role lends itself in a way to a certain resistance of specificity, but in this context and dynamic, Freeman really proved himself, imbuing the eternal creator with a powerful understated dignity which still managed to exude holy authority).
Bruce Almighty delivers a riotous collection of laugh-extracting physical humor and pithy dialogue.  It is also a Twilight Zone episode, seen through the lens of the multiplex-friendly movie, making it a deeper experience than something like Anger Management.  Worthy of a recommendation.",1053734400,9,5206,4.9495412844036695
1907688,4,B0000AKCKI,"Some of Jim Carrey's past movies contain a hit and miss premise (parts of ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and spots of ""The Cable Guy"", for example). But, as far as ""Bruce Almighty"" is concerned, Carrey's performance as a sideline reporter for a local television station is spot on. Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is one man who has all sorts of problems he cannot shake: he's the owner of a dog who isn't potty trained, and he has a job that he isn't particularly fond of. Throw in a lemon of a car no one would even think of owning, and he's not quite the envy of everyone around him; not even amongst his co-workers. The only one content with Nolan's life, is his passive wife (portrayed by Jennifer Aniston). An incident at work would change Nolan's life forever. Upon learning that a co-worker at the station (which is WKBW Channel 7 in Buffalo, New York - an actual TV station, by the way) is being promoted to the nightly news achor desk, Nolan has a hissyfit on the air during an important live interview segment, leading him to be terminated by the station. Then, nothing goes right for our hero, until, help arrives from...Guess who? ""The Lord Almighty"" (featuring Morgan Freeman in a rare ""semi-comedic"" performance), who's been watching over and observing Nolan's life forever, grants our hero enormous super powers, and the tables are suddenly turned. Nolan uses his new powers in sometimes strange and precarious ways, yet makes everything that was previously wrong, right again, and the world is suddenly a better place, right? Sometimes, as is often the case, having such control can be your personal enemy, as Nolan would soon find out. Although the comedy present in ""Bruce Almighty"" is sprinkled with a smattering of quintessential Jim Carrey nuttiness, it is the overall premise of the plot which enhances the wackiness contained within. Yes, the folks out in Hollywood have produced their share of bombastic flicks from time to time, but they have created a sheer majestical masterpiece with ""Bruce Almighty"" (even though there are some very minor blurry spots somewhere in the beginning and toward the end). It would be most recommended to see this film soon, before it ""vanishes"" into thin air. But, miss the parting of ""The Red Soup"", then ye shall be damned!",1053734400,,2270,4.823076923076923
