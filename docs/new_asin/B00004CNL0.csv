7919874,5,B00004CNL0,"Rented this excellent video years ago; would buy a copy if it were available. Two of my mother's children were stolen from her. Her daugther was able to find her after she had grown up. From what I understand, records of her son's adoption are still closed. They are still not reunited. The loss of these children nearly destroyed my mother's life. This story is for those who were stolen, those who lost children, and those who understand the value of learning a lesson from history. ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" This is one of the reasons why we support ParentalRights; the abuse of authority and power still occurs.",1340064000,,654,4.695652173913044
7919875,5,B00004CNL0,"This is a wonderful movie that I sorely wish would be released.  Mary Tyler Moore's dramatic acting is so greatly underrated.  She plays a true-life character by the name of Georgia Tann who supplies happiness to couples who for whatever reason are w/o offspring but in the interim, also brings great emotional pain and suffering to others and quite literally becomes a the devil in disguise to parents who may otherwise be experiencing some difficulty supplying proper homes or lifestyles to offspring of their own.  Lea Thompson plays a hopeful young women who, at first, sees Georgia as someone she looks up to until the awful truth of what is really going on in her stately mansion and home for wayward children slowly and eerily becomes more clear.  It is a compelling story and Mary Tyler Moore plays Georgia Tann w/stony authority.  It's a film which cries to be released on DVD and I can only hope that the powers that be soon agree.",1283126400,8,941,4.713414634146342
7919876,5,B00004CNL0,"Not wanting to reveal the plot of the story.  This is a true story set during the depression where two women set up a plan to make a tremendous amount of money, in so doing they make many families very happy and as many crushed.  The acting is great and you find yourself fighting for the truth to be exposed and justice to take place.
