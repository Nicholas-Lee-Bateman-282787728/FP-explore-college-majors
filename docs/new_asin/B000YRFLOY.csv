3035226,5,B000YRFLOY,"I saw this DVD at a friend's house, and my 5 year old daughter loved it. Her 10 year old brother enjoyed it a lot too! This is a great way to learn about ballet in the most engaging way possible for a young child. The alternating sequences - kids dancing, the real Swan Lake, and ballet moves demonstrated by child dancers -- keep it interesting and engaging for all viewers. It is laid out in such a way that the viewer really learns, and it's totally enjoyable and adorable too.",1199664000,2,480,4.285714285714286
3035227,5,B000YRFLOY,"The interweaving of story, ballet class subtext, Paris Opera Ballet staging, and little girl fun all combine to present a wonderful introduction to the world of dance.  Swan Lake is presented as a compelling love story that delights young viewers. Selected ballet steps are broken down and explained in approachable segments, and the little girls' interpretation of the steps is nothing short of infectious.  I wish I could experience dance as joyfully as a four-year-old!!",1199318400,2,473,5.293333333333333
3035228,5,B000YRFLOY,"We got this DVD for our 3 year old who loves to dress-up and play princess. She loves it, of course. Our 9 year old was not expecting to like the video at all but the ""real live ballerinas"" were mesmerizing & she has declared Prima Princessa is ""fabulous!"" Thank you for a video both girls can enjoy together!",1198800000,15,309,4.254237288135593
3035229,5,B000YRFLOY,"Do get this very creatively made DVD for your budding ballerina!  This video is a great introduction to Swan Lake with brief professional dance clips alternating with fun sequences of pre-school girls attempting similar moves - very cute! Young students from the School of American Ballet also perform the basic positions in easy to follow steps. Prima Princessa will likely appeal to any girl under 8 yrs. old interested in dance, although my 11 yr. old ballerina loved watching the beautifully performed dance segments by Paris Opera Ballet.  This is delightfully entertaining and educational too!",1198108800,,599,5.294736842105263
3035230,5,B000YRFLOY,"I bought this DVD for my 6 year-old daughter, who is currently taking ballet lessons.  I was watching her face as we watched and I could tell that she was really enjoying it.  She got very excited when the dance moves were explained and she knew the French words.  She was also compelled to get up and demonstrate the moves to me.  A nice feature is that the DVD covers the enitre story of Swan Lake in an abbreviated way that still conveys the emotion of the original.  Very well done and recommended for anyone with young ones interested in ballet.",1197849600,,550,4.405940594059406
3035231,3,B000YRFLOY,"My 5 year old daughter really enjoyed this video when we first got it.  She danced around her room imitating the ballerinas.  Now I encourage her to do it, but she seems bored with it.  She's taking ballet and gymnastics, but the video still doesn't spark her interest.  Great concept, I enjoyed it.  Wish I could give it more stars.",1440979200,,333,4.483333333333333

3035237,5,B000YRFLOY,"This is such a wonderful way to not only introduce dance to your little one, but its just enough actual ballet footage to get them excited about the arts. I recommend this for any little dancer.

3035241,4,B000YRFLOY,"I personally liked it.
My daughter (3 years 5 months) has seen it once, and isn't reall interested in this video.
Hasn't seen it again.",1380499200,,135,4.44
3035242,4,B000YRFLOY,"We have fun watching and dancing along. My son enjoys it too. This story is a little dark compared to the Nutcracker, so they prefer the latter.",1376179200,,144,4.37037037037037
3035243,5,B000YRFLOY,Each year I have my little ballerinas watch excerpts from the Prima Princessa DVDs.  It only takes a few minutes to watch one scene.  It sparks their imagination as I tell the story and then have them practice some of the steps that they see actual ballerinas performing!  They look forward to each class and to finishing the story.,1371513600,,332,4.593220338983051
3035244,4,B000YRFLOY,"Good product, kids get the story. Quite nice dancing. Overall I would recommend this product to other people. My daughter likes watching it",1370476800,,139,5.086956521739131
3035245,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter is 6 years old and loves ballet, though she was not very familiar with many ballets.  The Prima princessa dvds were a great way to introduce her to some beautiful ones.  She absolutely loves them, Swan Lake being her favorite.  Thanks to this DVD, she now wishes to dance the role of Odette when she grows up!

In case you are not familiar with Prima princessa, I will explain what it is like.  Let me start by saying that I can very easily see how some adults will find it incredibly annoying! I personally don't think it's that bad, however. And please don't let that discourage you from trying it. Little girls will love it!

The DVD begins with the cartoon fairy introducing the ballet to a group of children.  They all sit down to watch it on a little puppet stage.  The ballet is an actual professional performance (not a cartoon or anything) and the fairy narrates the whole thing in very kid friendly terms so they know what is happening throughout the story.  Between acts, the children ""get to dance"" and Prima Princessa teaches how to do a few ballet steps with the correct French terms.  The children are shown trying the steps as well as older ballet students demonstrating correct technique.  They also show funny little video clips of things that go along with the steps (a frog springing up off a lily pad to demonstrate a jump, kind of silly, but cute).  Then they go back to watch another act of Swan Lake.  The ballet is condensed down a lot to make it shorter and it has been made a little more child friendly with a happy ending.

My daughter's favorite part is definitely watching the real ballet. I am glad we found these dvds and am hoping that some day they make a few more!",1368835200,3,1711,4.4423076923076925
3035246,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter already loved this when she was 4.  After being on the back shelf for a while, she's just pulled it out and started dancing to it and watching it over and over again.  It is just the right combination of real ballet scenes with cute little girls dancing scenes to hold a youngster's attention!",1361923200,,305,4.428571428571429
3035247,5,B000YRFLOY,"The twins are 4 and their sister is almost 3. They ran and got their tutus on as soon as they saw the package. The DVD is a nice combination of professional dancers performing, professional dancers practicing and small children dancing in costume. I gave this 5 stars from a child's point of view. The switch of modes keeps the girls interested far beyond what a pure performance video would. And watching them twirl and sway was wonderful.",1361145600,,440,4.653846153846154
3035248,5,B000YRFLOY,I bought this for my granddaughter last year. She is still watching it this year. Can't really go wrong with ballerina-type movies for a 5 year old.,1360454400,,148,4.518518518518518
3035249,2,B000YRFLOY,"I guess I expected more instructional dancing and there is not much of it. My 4 year old loves instructional yoga videos and has been asking for a ballet one. I found this on netflix and saw that it had great reviews. She was only mildly interested in watching the swan lake ballet, but during the dancing sessions they only showed young girls jumping around and not really showing the move that well, they also showed professional dancers doing the move and then random shots of things in nature that jump, kick, turn and so on, but there was never any actual instruction. It was not captivating enough for my girls, maybe if she was in a ballet class she might find this more interesting, but as an introduction it wasn't enough so she didn't even watch the entire video.

I want to clarify that my daughter does follow instruction very well, she does gymnastics and figure skating and does children's yoga at home, she has several friends who do ballet and I have watched them teach her things and they preform the moves very well, maybe this style works for the more creative learner.",1358726400,,1088,4.579487179487179
3035250,5,B000YRFLOY,"I have two little ballerinas and they both love the Prima Princessa series. Their Nutcracker video is the most popular, and their favorite too, but after seeing it for the umpteenth time I ordered this one. Once again, the music, narration, and dancing is excellent.

The kids can get excited about quality dancing and music from these videos. They provide a solid introduction to ballet, and the kids can even learn a few moves from the videos. Overall, I recommend this series highly. The people who produce these have a great formula.",1341964800,,537,4.836956521739131
3035251,1,B000YRFLOY,"I have a very hard time believing people gave this more than a 1 star rating.  The only soundtrack is of the fairy narrator, and a few out-of-place, choppy sounds of children laughing.  The bits between swan lake repeat annoyingly.",1333929600,,231,4.75
3035252,3,B000YRFLOY,I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHO WISH TO HAVE BALLET LESSONS. ACCORDING TO ME THIS VIDEO IS GOOD TO USE AS AN INTRODUCTION FOR BALLET HOWEVER IT IS NOT MAKING HER LONGING FOR MORE LESSONS.,1330732800,,219,4.365853658536586
3035253,5,B000YRFLOY,"This is great for little girls who want to be ballerinas. :)
I have a 3 and 6 year old and I got it for my 3 year old for Christmas this year.
They both love it so much! And pretend to be the ballerinas on the video. :)
I would recommend this for any little girl that loves ballet!!",1324944000,,282,3.716666666666667
3035254,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter loves this DVD.  It really shows you how to do some basic moves and teaches you the story.  We want to get others, as they are great for the kids to watch before taking them to the real thing.",1314403200,,204,3.951219512195122
3035255,5,B000YRFLOY,"My girls love it. A great way to increase recall of simple ballet steps up to 4. Initially I was a little skeptical about this video only having up to four routines, but that is more than enough to increase proper technique and form and the swan lake movie alone has more than enough ballet routines to keep my girls 4 and 6 pretty busy. They practiced and want to watch the swan lake movie a 4th time after
 its arrival.",1314316800,,421,4.197530864197531
3035256,2,B000YRFLOY,"This was my fault as I should have known I wouldn't like it.  First, I did not think that while I love my daughter to be exposed to the arts, I did not want her to be exposed to the story itself of Swan Lake.  The idea of narrating the ballet is a great one, and it is fairly well done here.  However the story itself, of the evil part-owl creature taking all the maidens hostage with a spell is a bit much for my four year old in my opinion.  Also, I did not care for the fairy narrator's repeated emphasis on ""they were so madly in love""-- not to be a prude, but I like a more normal treatment of falling in love and less of a ""princess obsession"" that draws too much focus on the passionate love of the prince and princess.  I tried to turn the volume down during parts of narration, but then you miss the beautiful music. Finally, I too found the pictures of random moving objects unnecessary (maybe to simply ""entertain"" the youngest viewers); I for one prefer less bombardment with constant activity and images anyway and would prefer a slower pace in the non-ballet scenes.  Also, I would have preferred them to show an ""accomplished"" toddler ballerina to show the kids what is possible to achieve rather than operating on the assumption that a four year old will just flop around and look silly doing ballet moves in contrast to the adult figures.  In sum, this is a good concept and had elements that were good, but for this very picky mom I think I'll stick to the real ballets on video and cd.",1302220800,12,1504,4.3120567375886525
3035257,2,B000YRFLOY,I got this for my 4 year-old daughter and I was pretty disappointed. They show too little of the actual ballet and too much of little girls dancing and falling down. I realize that it isn't a good idea to show the whole story considering the demographic and how Swan Lake ends but they could at least show a whole scene being danced. My daughter lost interest while they were in between the dancing scenes but loved watching the ballerinas dance. I think from now on I will just get the DVDs of the ballets without any interruptions.,1297209600,2,533,4.448979591836735
3035258,5,B000YRFLOY,"It is a very fun movie to watch for all ages. Me and two of my girls, 6 years old and one and four months old love it very much. The little one started walking two months ago and she had already tried to copy the ballet movements. She was super excited to see the kids jumping. My older one just started ballet school this month. She gets to see the professionals and the learners in the movie. She can't wait to see the Nutcracker movie now. I wish to see more kids performing from the dance studio. Highly recommented!",1296000000,,520,4.21
3035259,5,B000YRFLOY,"As a mom of two sons, I'm always sort of stumped about giving gifts to young girls. I know absolutely zip about what they like and find all that pink and princessy stuff sort of cloying. I heard about Prima Princessa from a friend and gave it to my two young nieces just recently. I watched it with them the first time around and was so delighted by the intelligent yet fun approach the video took to ballet. My sister has followed up every few days, telling me that the girls have been watching Prima Princessa Swan Lake over and over and can barely be convinced to take their tutus off. I think we're going to try to organize a family outing to a real live Swan Lake performance when the next opportunity arises. Sure beats Sesame Street on Ice!",1291852800,,747,4.3428571428571425
3035260,5,B000YRFLOY,"Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake DVDA few weeks ago, I reviewed the much loved in our house Prima Princessa Presents: The Nutcracker DVD.

Well to my surprise (and the thrill of my daughter!), another treasure showed up in my mailbox soon after.

Stephanie Troeller, one of the co-creators of Prima Princessa, generously offered me a copy of Prima Princess Presents: Swan Lake!
(She has quickly become my daughter's new favorite person.)

Yet another charming DVD, it features our favorite fairy friend who narrates and guides the children through the story.  Swan Lake is performed in scenes by the extraordinary Paris Opera Ballet, and their beauty of the dance is just enthralling.  (I so enjoyed watching such grace and talent!)

In between clips, your little ballerina is encouraged to put on their tutu and get up and dance.  I love letting my littles watch something that they can actually participate in!

Simple ballet moves are taught and demonstrated throughout by the American School of Ballet.  They are easily shown step by step, and soon your own little Prima Princessa will be up and dancing everywhere she goes.

This series is so engaging...it was created by two moms who wanted to share their passion of dance with children in a super fun way. The joy of movement is contagious, and that's what they hope to spread with their DVDs.
Prima Princessa ballerina cartoon character
I would say they did an amazing job.

Looking for the perfect stocking stuffer for your ballerina?
Then you must get Prima Princessa Presents: Swan Lake...and let the dancing begin!

And in the meantime, I will anxiously await the release of Prima Princessa Presents: Sleeping Beauty",1291420800,,1680,5.003597122302159
3035261,5,B000YRFLOY,"This keeps my daughter thoroughly entertained.
The actual dance scenes and the NY city ballet dancers are really great, but the kids are a bit kitschy.
Great for the 4-6 set of girls, and the fact that its only about 25 mins is great if you don't prescribe to too much screen time (or while you fix dinner)",1290038400,,306,4.293103448275862
3035262,5,B000YRFLOY,Very good DVD for young ones that enjoy ballet. Easy to understand. Our grandchild love it.,1289347200,,91,4.75
3035263,5,B000YRFLOY,Movie was in great condition. Our 2.5 yr old daughter loves dancing to it. Very cute.,1283731200,,85,4.375
3035264,5,B000YRFLOY,My 4 1/2-year-old loves this DVD.  She was mesmerized by it.  I think she also related to the scenes showing the young children dancing around in their tutus!,1280275200,,158,4.607142857142857
3035265,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter loved this. With the help of the narrator, she caught on to the story quickly. She loves stories with princes and usually pretends to be the prince. When Prima Princessa said ""now it's our turn to dance,"" she made me get up and dance with her. Then she made her daddy dance. She tried out the steps being taught and made up some of her own. Cute!  I don't have anything negative to say about it. As an adult, I would've preferred more of the ballet and less of the dance demonstrations, but it's best for little ones the way it is. The dance lesson montages each play over again, which Suzi loved. Also, I don't know if the DVD could've held her attention the way it did with any more of the ballet, especially if it had been presented without breaks. I think it does a good job of making the ballet something little children can understand and enjoy.",1276732800,,863,4.327160493827161
3035266,4,B000YRFLOY,"But I was expecting a little more. I gave it four stars because my children were satisfied with the product and really enjoyed it. However, I wished they would have taken time to show the children how to do the moves properly step-by-step. Even though they show ballerinas doing the steps, they don's slow down and explain it so the kids can do it right. I did really like how it was interactive and I liked the narrative explaining the story. Really my main critique is I would have liked them to be more specific on how to do the steps.",1276646400,,538,4.336633663366337
3035267,5,B000YRFLOY,"I only purchased it because I saw other reviews although it didn't sound that ""fun"" to me, however my 4-year-old, who is all about ballet, princes and princess absolutely loves it to my surprise. There are only a few little steps to practice but it is a good introduction to classical music/ballet and theatre. I am surprised how my daughter loves watching the theatre performance in nice short intervals.",1274832000,,405,4.884057971014493
3035268,5,B000YRFLOY,"This 40-minute DVD is perfect for any little girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina.  Prima Princessa, an animated fairy ballerina, narrates the video, featuring the world-renowned Paris Opera Ballet performaing Swan Lake.  I love that Prima Princessa explains what is going on in the ballet so that young watchers can understand and follow the dance.  Between acts, Prima Princessa guides viewers through ballet steps demonstrated by students from the School of American Ballet.  There are also young budding ballerinas attempting these steps and having a wonderful time.

My girls love the dancing in the video.  I had to smile when my eldest commented that she didn't really know that people could put their legs that high and thought only Barbies could do that.  Everytime they watch the video, out come their tutus and ballet slippers and they begin dancing.  They can really relate to the little ballerinas and are enchanted with the Paris Opera Ballerinas.  I like that they were learing the story of the ballet.

I enjoyed watching the ballet but was especially impressed with the educational component of learning the ballet and learning the dance steps.  In addition to just watching and learning at home, this would be an wonderful teaching tool for children to watch prior to going to an actual ballet.  In fact, I hope to get the Prima Princessa Presents the Nutcracker prior to taking the girls this Christmas.

3035269,5,B000YRFLOY,"Ordered this for my 5-yr old.  She took very informal ballet lessons when she was 4, and has attended a couple of ballets (geared toward children) that she enjoyed.  She really enjoys this video.  She has taken it to her grandparents' houses, along with her slippers and leotard, and shows them.  I haven't seen the whole thing, but I like that, during the instruction parts, they show a dancer demonstrating the move properly, then show a group of little girls (with their tutus, etc) doing their own version.  Then they show an animal or something that is moving in a similar fashion.  My daughter, being somewhat of a perfectionist, doesn't get caught up in doing it just like the dancer....and is laughing and having a good time while she's doing it.  A very worthwhile purchase in my opinion.",1272240000,,797,4.731884057971015
3035270,5,B000YRFLOY,"Prima Princessa was started by two work at home moms, Stephanie Troeller and Mary Kate Mellow, who thought it would be great to bring the beauty and wonder of ballet into the lives of young children who otherwise might not have that opportunity. You gotta love the success of these ladies!

I LOVED how the ballet was explained to kids in an easy to understand story line and broken down into chunks that they didn't get bored with at all. My daughter was entranced with the first chapter and then advised me we had to stop the dvd so she could put her Wiggles ballet outfit on, so she could 'be a ballerina too'. When I started it back up it was the lesson time and she had a fun time dancing and following the young girls on the screen!

This is a super gift idea for any young girl- it's fun AND educational!",1268870400,,811,4.259740259740259
3035271,5,B000YRFLOY,"I reviewed this DVD for my blog Katie's Nesting Spot; I really liked the DVD format, it broke Swan Lake into several shorter acts with Princess Princessa appearing in between to lead the girls in learning a few simple ballet steps. These were demonstrated by students from the School of American Ballet, followed by the darling little girls showing off their own versions of the steps. It was a bit repetitious, the clips with Prima Princessa were shown twice in a row, but after some consideration I decided it was very age appropriate for my daughter. Sometimes it wasn't until the second time through that she joined in with her own moves.

The only drawback to this DVD, was that the storyline of Swan Lake did cause my 3.5 year old a little bit of apprehension, the evil magician scared her, but she's a bit of a scardy cat. I think most of her peers at preschool would've been fine with it, and she still liked the sections with Prima Princessa. Two more titles are due to be released this year; perhaps another story would've been better to start with.

I am really glad the video showed professional ballerina's in a performance setting, to show my daughter what real ballerina looks like. The forty minute length was perfect for her and we especially enjoyed the bonus feature of the baby swan dance. The overall DVD had a high quality of production and it's sure to be enjoyed by little ones interested in dance.",1268870400,,1422,4.616600790513834
3035272,5,B000YRFLOY,"If you have a tutu-wearing little girl in your house then you must check out this DVD.  Now I actually watched it by myself because my boys wanted nothing to do with it, but it is an adorable DVD.  The DVD puts the story of Swan Lake in a way that kids can understand and is told by an animated Prima Princessa as you see parts of the actual ballet going on.  Throughout the DVD there are also scenes of actual little girls dancing around and practicing ballets.  Ballet steps are also displayed for budding little dancers!

Overall, I thought Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake is perfect for any little girls.  It  is a great substitute for everyday cartoons and for the low price, you can't go wrong.  I also like that it is 40 minutes long so you really do get a lot out of the DVD.

I received this DVD to review, but this post is 100% my opinion.",1268524800,,852,4.24223602484472
3035273,5,B000YRFLOY,"As soon as I brought out Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake, she saw that it was about ballet and instantly went and put on one of her 3 tutu's. She was so excited that she continued to run around the room while I got the DVD put in the player and on the TV.

I love the way the DVD is broken up. You actually get to watch the Paris Opera Ballet perform Swan Lake all the while Prima Princessa narrates the entire story so your kids know what is going on. After each act viewers are given the opportunity to learn some ballet moves. This is great because it was hard for my girl to sit during the actual show so when the time came and Prima Princessa declared that it was our turn she was up and moving quicker than you can say jete!

3035274,5,B000YRFLOY,"I was really excited to review this video, with three girls in the family ballerinas are loved.  At first I sat down with my older two girls to watch it, and half way through the video the younger two kids came and sat down.
This is a really great way to introduce Ballet to children of all ages.  The video starts of with Prima Princess who narrates the story.  The video features the Paris Opera Ballet performing four acts of Swan Lake.  In between each act, their are children from the school of American Ballet who show you how to do specific ballet steps.  There are four steps taught:

  * Pirouette- to turn
  * jete`- to jump
  * pas de chat - step of the cat
  * grand battement- big kick

Each step is spoken and then illustrated by the child ballerinas, then there are scenes to reinforce what each step means.  For instance-Jete` means to jump, they then showed a cat jumping etc.  I really liked how each step was shown and then reinforced repeatedly.  In between the acts are scenes of small little girls dressed up in their tutus dancing around and laughing.
I really thought this was a great video, and even though it says ages 3-6 all my kids liked certain parts.  My older daughters (8) and (6) enjoyed the ballerinas performing, while the youngest (20 months) liked to watch when the little girls danced and played.

3035275,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter really enjoys this DVD, and it has been a fun way to introduce her to ballet. You may be disappointed, however, if you are looking for an instructional DVD - while ballet moves are introduced, they are not taught in a serious way.",1268006400,,242,4.4
3035276,5,B000YRFLOY,"The whole time I was growing up I looked forward to going to The Nutcracker every single year. I even was in it one year. I also remember when my Dad took me to a fancy ballet as a Father-Daughter date once and how exciting that was! There's just something about beautiful ballerina's in fancy costumes and tutus that every little girl loves!

My little ballerina is no different! Although the Prima Princessa DVDs are recommended for ages 3-6 my 2 year old loved Swan Lake. We put on one of her 3 tutus (lol) and she'd dance along and kept asking for ""More more pallerinas!!!"" It was so adorable :)

The DVD is a mix of acts from professional ballet productions and little girls in tutus learning simple steps and dancing around. The whole story is narrated, so even as an adult you get what's going on ;) I actually learned a lot about the story of Swan Lake. I had seen the animated movie that came out when my youngest sister was little years ago, but hadn't realized it was a famous ballet that came long ago.

My daughter and I both really enjoy this DVD and it would be perfect for any little ballerina in your life!

3035277,5,B000YRFLOY,"My little girl loves watching this DVD and is so cute dancing right along with it!

Prima Princessa jots from of a real performance of the Swan Lake ballet to a cute cartoon ballet dancer ""Prima Princessa"" who introduces ballet moves performed by little girls.

It's hard to describe it since it isn't like any other children's DVD I have ever seen, but my 2 1/2 year old dances right along with it and keeps wanting to watch it over and over again.

We had my nieces ages 5 and 7 watch it, and the 5 year old was interested but the 7 year old was not. I recommend this DVD for younger girls ages 2-5 who love dancing. My daughter (pictured above) takes ballet so that may have been why she loves this video so much she watches it twice in a row (it is about 45 minutes long).

Blog Review Disclosure: I was in no way paid for this review and this is my honest opinion of Prima Princessa.  I reviewed this DVD for my blog [...].",1267574400,,928,4.162011173184357
3035278,5,B000YRFLOY,"My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves this dvd. She even tries to dance along. I would describe the format of this program as similar to the baby einstein videos but much better. There are segments with real ballet footage that is narrated so children understand there is a story being portrayed in the ballet, for this one it is Swan Lake. My daughter especially liked seeing the younger girls dancing. The ballet steps are clearly shown and repeated. they are also reinforced creatively by showing the word, explaining what it means showing the dancers doing the movement and then showing toys, animals or other children doing the same movement. I wouldn't say this is a ballet lesson but just a simple introduction that is very entertaining for very small children. I will definitely purchase more from Prima Princessa.",1267488000,,824,4.9352517985611515
3035279,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter and I had a lot of fun watching the Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake DVD yesterday.  My four and a half year old gal took her first ballet class a couple of months ago.  It was a great experience.

Prima Princessa's Swan Lake DVD got my daughter all excited about ballet again.  The video does a nice job of combining footage of profession dancers, ballet students and young children.  The story of Swan Lake is shown in clips from each of the four acts.  The voiceover does a fabulous job of explaining the story as the dancers from the world-renowned Paris Opera Ballet perform excerpts from Swan Lake live on stage.  Between acts the adorable cartoon Prima Princessa guides viewers through ballet steps preformed by School of American Ballet students.  Then you get to watch young children (ages 4-6?) practicing the steps.

My little gal really enjoyed watching the professional dancers and following the story.  The summary at the end of each act really helped her follow along.  She also liked watching the students show the various steps.  Her favorite part seemed to be the scenes when animals were ""performing"" the steps.  She absolutely cracked up when a flamingo was doing a piroutte!  I was surprised to find her so entranced with the music.  She kept asking to have to sound turned up.  The 40 minute running time was just the right length.  The only part I would want to change is the section between acts when the children are practicing their steps.  It is adorable and got my daughter moving, however she seemed to want to have the ""encore"" showing of the steps shorter.  She said that she'd already seen that part and that she wanted to get back to the story.",1267401600,,1691,4.671186440677966
3035280,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter, took ballet when she was 4. Around the same time she was diagnosed with Leukemia and was unable to finish classes for that year. She went into isolation soon after treatment began. Two years later and she still misses ballet. She has several DVDs and never hesitates to watch any and all ballet shows she finds on TV. When we received our copy of the Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake DVD she was very excited. About 5 minutes in I knew that she absolutely loved it. She said and I quote,""There is a cartoon ballerina Moma! Oh and real life ballerinas Moma. This is the greatest ballet movie ever Moma. I love Swan Lake Moma. Moma!! It has ballet classes on here too! Moma, they even know the names of the dances like my teacher does!"" She loved it I'm still hearing tidbits of the story and about what dances she is learning. She has even started comparing it to her other ballet movies. I think she has a brand new favorite. I recommend purchasing your own copy for $6.99 its a great buy!

3035281,5,B000YRFLOY,"I have wanted my daughter to take ballet classes since she was born, but my husband says the same thing every time I mention it "" I cannot see paying $65 every month, when she can dance at home for free"". Men, they just don't get it! If I am being realistic I understand that as a family of six we really can't afford that, but I still want her to learn ballet.....

Enter Prima Princessa... If you are like me and want your little princess to learn the fine art and discipline of ballet but can't take out a second mortgage to pay for lessons (which I don't recommend) this DVD is for you! I can not say enough good things about it, but I will try!

First of all Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake is only 6.99, that is unbelievable for a DVD! Secondly the way it's put together is so simple (as in it interests my 22 month old) yet so sophisticated! I was quite shocked when I hit play and realized we would be watching actual ballerinas from the school of American Ballet preform Swan Lake, and I'll admit I wondered if it would keep her attention, which it did! I think I enjoyed watching it as much as she did!

But the best part (aside from the animated ballerina who narrates the DVD) is that it engages your little ""student"" of ballet and gets her involved in the movements all while teaching basic ballet terminology! It's like the Baby Einstein of ballet!

This DVD has really encouraged me to do all I can to teach her about ballet, even if I can't afford formal lessons! I even plan to buy the the Prima Princessa
Ballet For Beginners Book so I can learn more about ballet!",1266624000,6,1585,4.273333333333333

I like how the DVD would show parts and explain the story of Swan Lake. Then they would show the little children acting out the scenes. It showed some basic moves that the children could do and learn right along with them. They also had the word of the move they were doing on the screen so the kids could look at the word see how it was spelled and hear it pronounced and then they were shown how to do it. She really liked the cartoon fairy on the screen.

3035283,5,B000YRFLOY,"I have two divas within my household which are definitely princesses in their own right. They love to dance their own dance style, so I was thinking that they would enjoy this, but I was amazed as they started to watch how much they were engaged in the film.

Both of my girls had their eyes glued to the television and as they watched they loved trying out the dances that they were being taught. As an educator myself, I loved seeing the educational components within the film. This education was a true creative arts gem. It provided the opportunity for kids to not only learn about dance, but also about music and themselves.

By the end of the DVD my eldest daughter was telling me the story of Swan Lake as if she had seen it many times. So kudos to the moms who developed this DVD! Parents with kids who like to be creative and/or music and dance will love this DVD.

I truly encourage all of you to check it out today!

3035284,5,B000YRFLOY,"I admit it.  When I was a little girl, I wanted to dance my little tush off and spin around as fast as I could.  I wanted to make up routines and wear the pretty clothes.  Well, I never did get to be a little ballerina, but my daughter is now at the age of 5 and wanting to dance like a princess.

When Prima Princess sent me this DVD, my daughter wanted to watch it in the living room so she would have plenty of room to twirl around.  She LOVED it.  She loved the music, the ballerina's and the cartoon ballerina that narrated the movie.  She is even asking for tutu's and ballet shoes now.  She liked how they showed her different ballet moves and now she is anxious for Daddy to get home so she can show him.

The only thing is my daughter wishes it were longer.  It is only a 40 minute movie, and she was still wanting to dance! So I happily replayed it for her and she is enjoying it again.

A great DVD for your little princess, dancer or music lover child.  They will get 40 minutes of fun and you will get 40 minutes of peace!

Princess Princessa guides viewers through a performance of Swan Lake, which is performed by the world famous Paris Opera ballet. My 3 yr old started go get restless after a few minutes of the ballet, but her attention was renewed with the intermission. Between acts of the ballet, the video cuts to tutu-clad preschoolers dancing about outside. My daughter was mesmerized and wanted to get up and dance around herself. I liked how it got her out of the chair and dancing around. They also teach about the basics of ballet. My daughter isn't ready to learn the positions yet, but she did enjoy dancing around. I think I need to get her a pretty pink tutu so she can pretend she's in the video. So the younger ones can enjoy the dancing and Princess Princessa flitting around and the older kids can learn about the story of Swan Lake.

The video uses the ballet Swan Lake to teach children the basic ballet steps. The animated character keeps their attention and makes this a fun ballet learning tool. Your little ballerina, no matter what level they are at, will have fun learning with the other ballerinas from The School of American Ballet.

It's like bringing a live ballet into your home and the perfect way to introduce young children to the art of ballet. I love that Prima Princessa narates each act so that children know exactly what's happening. I have to admit that I am in love with this DVD! From the sweet little girls playing in pink tutus to the fabulous music by Peter Tchaikovsky - ever little bit of this DVD is entertaining to the fullest! Even my 13 year old daughter was entranced by the live performances.

3035290,3,B000YRFLOY,"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old granddaughter after reading the rave reviews, but I was disappointed. Two aspects of the program left me wanting more. It was great to see the professional ballerinas, and also the (approx.) 10 - 12 year old students demonstrating the first positions and a few movements, but then they also continually cut to a group of 4 - 5 year olds dressed in tutus prancing around outdoors free-form and acting silly. These scenes are cute, but did not help my 3 year old relate to the fact that she is expected to follow the movements and instruction of her teacher when she goes to ballet class. It really would have been better if they had shown a teacher with the girls, and showed them at least attempting to follow along.

The second thing which I felt was not helpful to my 3 year old, was that during the demonstration by the older students of the first positions and a few movements, the producer continually cut to scenes of live animals to convey the concepts of numbers and movements. This really wasn't necessary, and just confused and distracted my granddaughter who was initially very interested in watching the student's movements.",1233792000,15,1172,4.661835748792271
3035291,4,B000YRFLOY,"The segments of Swan Lake performance included in the video are absolutely beautiful. I wish there were more. In between the segments the video shows 4-5 basic ballet movements, each demonstrated by ballet students and other real life objects doing similar things (like a top spinning or a tiger jumping). They are all nice to watch. The fairy that is leading the whole video has an annoying voice and laughter, but that's to be expected for a children's video. The 'audience' of the ballet performance are a bunch of little girls dressed up in tutus and they are silly and cute, just as they should be. A very entertaining video even for adult viewers. A nice way to expose your children to real classic ballet, but not one from which you would expect them to learn.",1219363200,3,767,4.647058823529412
3035292,5,B000YRFLOY,"My girls (ages 5 1/2 and almost 4) love to dance. If you have girls, you might have already heard of Prima Princessa. If not, here's the gist - It's a hybrid presentation on DVD. Part entertainment, part education. It may be more appropriate to say that it is education under the guise of entertainment. It consists of a presentation of Swan Lake by The Paris Opera Ballet broken into acts. The acts are further broken up by mini ballet lessons explaining and demonstrating different ballet moves. The entire DVD is narrated by a youth-friendly voice and cartoon fairy princess.

When I pulled out the surprise DVD for the girls to watch, their mouths dropped open and they were mesmerized. Not only did they pay attention to the ballet, but they asked appropriate questions: My (Almost) 4 year old asked - ""If he don't (SIC) find her, what's going to happen?"" They also repeated the tutorial words like ""Peer-oh-ette"" and mimicked the student dancers. I tried to take a few pictures but was chastised by my 5 1/2 year old when I tried to get her to hold still for a snapshot. ""Mom! I'm a Swan!""

When it was over, they both exclaimed in unison ""I want to do it again."" They both did a marvelous job on retelling the story even!

Another day, a neighbor showed up with her 4 year old daughter and 18 month old son, along with two 4 year old girls she was babysitting. After playing outside for a bit, I invited them in and we popped in Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake. If you could only have seen our family room filled with 6 children dancing along with the ballet and students!

The DVD was a hit with all the kids and I enjoyed it as well. I hate to admit that I've never bothered to watch any performance of Swan Lake so it turned out to be a learning experience for me too!

This DVD is just what this mom ordered. I took ballet as a child and have been recently trying to plant the dance bug in my 3 year old daughter's ear. You can only give her so many tutu's and princess things while asking ""do you want to take ballet this year?""

Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake features a cartoon ballerina who narrates Swan Lake for us. Swan Lake, being performed by the Paris Opera Ballet is beautifully done. In between acts, we are treated to various ballet steps all set to a montage of toys, animals, children and young dancers for the viewer to learn. My daughter particularly loved the segments of little girls running around and laughing in their tutus. This 40 minute DVD has enough to keep the preschool age child all the way up to Grandma's age interested.

I organized a play date with my girlfriend so that my 3 year old could watch it with a friend (a 9 year old dancer student). The plan was to have the girls watch the movie while we continued our own play date over at the dining room table with coffee and our laptops. We started the tape and were completely sucked in. So much so that we took our respective places next to our daughters and watched the whole movie with them.

While the movie was playing I heard my girlfriend's daughter tell her mom that she wants to stay in ballet (she had been thinking of dropping it because she doesn't love her teacher).

This is a great way to introduce dance to your little one or to reinforce someone's love for dance.

3269740,5,B000YRFLOY,Each year I have my little ballerinas watch excerpts from the Prima Princessa DVDs.  It only takes a few minutes to watch one scene.  It sparks their imagination as I tell the story and then have them practice some of the steps that they see actual ballerinas performing!  They look forward to each class and to finishing the story.,1371513600,,332,4.593220338983051
3269741,4,B000YRFLOY,"Good product, kids get the story. Quite nice dancing. Overall I would recommend this product to other people. My daughter likes watching it",1370476800,,139,5.086956521739131
3269742,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter is 6 years old and loves ballet, though she was not very familiar with many ballets.  The Prima princessa dvds were a great way to introduce her to some beautiful ones.  She absolutely loves them, Swan Lake being her favorite.  Thanks to this DVD, she now wishes to dance the role of Odette when she grows up!

In case you are not familiar with Prima princessa, I will explain what it is like.  Let me start by saying that I can very easily see how some adults will find it incredibly annoying! I personally don't think it's that bad, however. And please don't let that discourage you from trying it. Little girls will love it!

The DVD begins with the cartoon fairy introducing the ballet to a group of children.  They all sit down to watch it on a little puppet stage.  The ballet is an actual professional performance (not a cartoon or anything) and the fairy narrates the whole thing in very kid friendly terms so they know what is happening throughout the story.  Between acts, the children ""get to dance"" and Prima Princessa teaches how to do a few ballet steps with the correct French terms.  The children are shown trying the steps as well as older ballet students demonstrating correct technique.  They also show funny little video clips of things that go along with the steps (a frog springing up off a lily pad to demonstrate a jump, kind of silly, but cute).  Then they go back to watch another act of Swan Lake.  The ballet is condensed down a lot to make it shorter and it has been made a little more child friendly with a happy ending.

My daughter's favorite part is definitely watching the real ballet. I am glad we found these dvds and am hoping that some day they make a few more!",1368835200,3,1711,4.4423076923076925
3269743,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter already loved this when she was 4.  After being on the back shelf for a while, she's just pulled it out and started dancing to it and watching it over and over again.  It is just the right combination of real ballet scenes with cute little girls dancing scenes to hold a youngster's attention!",1361923200,,305,4.428571428571429
3269744,5,B000YRFLOY,"The twins are 4 and their sister is almost 3. They ran and got their tutus on as soon as they saw the package. The DVD is a nice combination of professional dancers performing, professional dancers practicing and small children dancing in costume. I gave this 5 stars from a child's point of view. The switch of modes keeps the girls interested far beyond what a pure performance video would. And watching them twirl and sway was wonderful.",1361145600,,440,4.653846153846154
3269745,5,B000YRFLOY,I bought this for my granddaughter last year. She is still watching it this year. Can't really go wrong with ballerina-type movies for a 5 year old.,1360454400,,148,4.518518518518518
3269746,2,B000YRFLOY,"I guess I expected more instructional dancing and there is not much of it. My 4 year old loves instructional yoga videos and has been asking for a ballet one. I found this on netflix and saw that it had great reviews. She was only mildly interested in watching the swan lake ballet, but during the dancing sessions they only showed young girls jumping around and not really showing the move that well, they also showed professional dancers doing the move and then random shots of things in nature that jump, kick, turn and so on, but there was never any actual instruction. It was not captivating enough for my girls, maybe if she was in a ballet class she might find this more interesting, but as an introduction it wasn't enough so she didn't even watch the entire video.

I want to clarify that my daughter does follow instruction very well, she does gymnastics and figure skating and does children's yoga at home, she has several friends who do ballet and I have watched them teach her things and they preform the moves very well, maybe this style works for the more creative learner.",1358726400,,1088,4.579487179487179

The kids can get excited about quality dancing and music from these videos. They provide a solid introduction to ballet, and the kids can even learn a few moves from the videos. Overall, I recommend this series highly. The people who produce these have a great formula.",1341964800,,537,4.836956521739131

3269751,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter loves this DVD.  It really shows you how to do some basic moves and teaches you the story.  We want to get others, as they are great for the kids to watch before taking them to the real thing.",1314403200,,204,3.951219512195122
3269752,5,B000YRFLOY,"My girls love it. A great way to increase recall of simple ballet steps up to 4. Initially I was a little skeptical about this video only having up to four routines, but that is more than enough to increase proper technique and form and the swan lake movie alone has more than enough ballet routines to keep my girls 4 and 6 pretty busy. They practiced and want to watch the swan lake movie a 4th time after
 its arrival.",1314316800,,421,4.197530864197531
3269753,2,B000YRFLOY,"This was my fault as I should have known I wouldn't like it.  First, I did not think that while I love my daughter to be exposed to the arts, I did not want her to be exposed to the story itself of Swan Lake.  The idea of narrating the ballet is a great one, and it is fairly well done here.  However the story itself, of the evil part-owl creature taking all the maidens hostage with a spell is a bit much for my four year old in my opinion.  Also, I did not care for the fairy narrator's repeated emphasis on ""they were so madly in love""-- not to be a prude, but I like a more normal treatment of falling in love and less of a ""princess obsession"" that draws too much focus on the passionate love of the prince and princess.  I tried to turn the volume down during parts of narration, but then you miss the beautiful music. Finally, I too found the pictures of random moving objects unnecessary (maybe to simply ""entertain"" the youngest viewers); I for one prefer less bombardment with constant activity and images anyway and would prefer a slower pace in the non-ballet scenes.  Also, I would have preferred them to show an ""accomplished"" toddler ballerina to show the kids what is possible to achieve rather than operating on the assumption that a four year old will just flop around and look silly doing ballet moves in contrast to the adult figures.  In sum, this is a good concept and had elements that were good, but for this very picky mom I think I'll stick to the real ballets on video and cd.",1302220800,12,1504,4.3120567375886525
3269754,2,B000YRFLOY,I got this for my 4 year-old daughter and I was pretty disappointed. They show too little of the actual ballet and too much of little girls dancing and falling down. I realize that it isn't a good idea to show the whole story considering the demographic and how Swan Lake ends but they could at least show a whole scene being danced. My daughter lost interest while they were in between the dancing scenes but loved watching the ballerinas dance. I think from now on I will just get the DVDs of the ballets without any interruptions.,1297209600,2,533,4.448979591836735
3269755,5,B000YRFLOY,"It is a very fun movie to watch for all ages. Me and two of my girls, 6 years old and one and four months old love it very much. The little one started walking two months ago and she had already tried to copy the ballet movements. She was super excited to see the kids jumping. My older one just started ballet school this month. She gets to see the professionals and the learners in the movie. She can't wait to see the Nutcracker movie now. I wish to see more kids performing from the dance studio. Highly recommented!",1296000000,,520,4.21

I know absolutely zip about what they like and find all that pink and princessy stuff sort of cloying. I heard about Prima Princessa from a friend and gave it to my two young nieces just recently. I watched it with them the first time around and was so delighted by the intelligent yet fun approach the video took to ballet. My sister has followed up every few days, telling me that the girls have been watching Prima Princessa Swan Lake over and over and can barely be convinced to take their tutus off. I think we're going to try to organize a family outing to a real live Swan Lake performance when the next opportunity arises. Sure beats Sesame Street on Ice!",1291852800,,747,4.3428571428571425
3269757,5,B000YRFLOY,"Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake DVDA few weeks ago, I reviewed the much loved in our house Prima Princessa Presents: The Nutcracker DVD.

Well to my surprise (and the thrill of my daughter!), another treasure showed up in my mailbox soon after.

Stephanie Troeller, one of the co-creators of Prima Princessa, generously offered me a copy of Prima Princess Presents: Swan Lake!
(She has quickly become my daughter's new favorite person.)

Yet another charming DVD, it features our favorite fairy friend who narrates and guides the children through the story.  Swan Lake is performed in scenes by the extraordinary Paris Opera Ballet, and their beauty of the dance is just enthralling.  (I so enjoyed watching such grace and talent!)

In between clips, your little ballerina is encouraged to put on their tutu and get up and dance.  I love letting my littles watch something that they can actually participate in!

Simple ballet moves are taught and demonstrated throughout by the American School of Ballet.  They are easily shown step by step, and soon your own little Prima Princessa will be up and dancing everywhere she goes.

This series is so engaging...it was created by two moms who wanted to share their passion of dance with children in a super fun way. The joy of movement is contagious, and that's what they hope to spread with their DVDs.
Prima Princessa ballerina cartoon character
I would say they did an amazing job.

Looking for the perfect stocking stuffer for your ballerina?
Then you must get Prima Princessa Presents: Swan Lake...and let the dancing begin!

And in the meantime, I will anxiously await the release of Prima Princessa Presents: Sleeping Beauty",1291420800,,1680,5.003597122302159
3269758,5,B000YRFLOY,"This keeps my daughter thoroughly entertained.
The actual dance scenes and the NY city ballet dancers are really great, but the kids are a bit kitschy.
Great for the 4-6 set of girls, and the fact that its only about 25 mins is great if you don't prescribe to too much screen time (or while you fix dinner)",1290038400,,306,4.293103448275862
3269759,5,B000YRFLOY,Very good DVD for young ones that enjoy ballet. Easy to understand. Our grandchild love it.,1289347200,,91,4.75

3269761,5,B000YRFLOY,My 4 1/2-year-old loves this DVD.  She was mesmerized by it.  I think she also related to the scenes showing the young children dancing around in their tutus!,1280275200,,158,4.607142857142857
3269762,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter loved this. With the help of the narrator, she caught on to the story quickly. She loves stories with princes and usually pretends to be the prince. When Prima Princessa said ""now it's our turn to dance,"" she made me get up and dance with her. Then she made her daddy dance. She tried out the steps being taught and made up some of her own. Cute!  I don't have anything negative to say about it. As an adult, I would've preferred more of the ballet and less of the dance demonstrations, but it's best for little ones the way it is. The dance lesson montages each play over again, which Suzi loved. Also, I don't know if the DVD could've held her attention the way it did with any more of the ballet, especially if it had been presented without breaks. I think it does a good job of making the ballet something little children can understand and enjoy.",1276732800,,863,4.327160493827161
3269763,4,B000YRFLOY,"But I was expecting a little more. I gave it four stars because my children were satisfied with the product and really enjoyed it. However, I wished they would have taken time to show the children how to do the moves properly step-by-step. Even though they show ballerinas doing the steps, they don's slow down and explain it so the kids can do it right. I did really like how it was interactive and I liked the narrative explaining the story. Really my main critique is I would have liked them to be more specific on how to do the steps.",1276646400,,538,4.336633663366337
3269764,5,B000YRFLOY,"I only purchased it because I saw other reviews although it didn't sound that ""fun"" to me, however my 4-year-old, who is all about ballet, princes and princess absolutely loves it to my surprise. There are only a few little steps to practice but it is a good introduction to classical music/ballet and theatre. I am surprised how my daughter loves watching the theatre performance in nice short intervals.",1274832000,,405,4.884057971014493
3269765,5,B000YRFLOY,"This 40-minute DVD is perfect for any little girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina.  Prima Princessa, an animated fairy ballerina, narrates the video, featuring the world-renowned Paris Opera Ballet performaing Swan Lake.  I love that Prima Princessa explains what is going on in the ballet so that young watchers can understand and follow the dance.  Between acts, Prima Princessa guides viewers through ballet steps demonstrated by students from the School of American Ballet.  There are also young budding ballerinas attempting these steps and having a wonderful time.

My girls love the dancing in the video.  I had to smile when my eldest commented that she didn't really know that people could put their legs that high and thought only Barbies could do that.  Everytime they watch the video, out come their tutus and ballet slippers and they begin dancing.  They can really relate to the little ballerinas and are enchanted with the Paris Opera Ballerinas.  I like that they were learing the story of the ballet.

I enjoyed watching the ballet but was especially impressed with the educational component of learning the ballet and learning the dance steps.  In addition to just watching and learning at home, this would be an wonderful teaching tool for children to watch prior to going to an actual ballet.  In fact, I hope to get the Prima Princessa Presents the Nutcracker prior to taking the girls this Christmas.

3269766,5,B000YRFLOY,"Ordered this for my 5-yr old.  She took very informal ballet lessons when she was 4, and has attended a couple of ballets (geared toward children) that she enjoyed.  She really enjoys this video.  She has taken it to her grandparents' houses, along with her slippers and leotard, and shows them.  I haven't seen the whole thing, but I like that, during the instruction parts, they show a dancer demonstrating the move properly, then show a group of little girls (with their tutus, etc) doing their own version.  Then they show an animal or something that is moving in a similar fashion.  My daughter, being somewhat of a perfectionist, doesn't get caught up in doing it just like the dancer....and is laughing and having a good time while she's doing it.  A very worthwhile purchase in my opinion.",1272240000,,797,4.731884057971015
3269767,5,B000YRFLOY,"Prima Princessa was started by two work at home moms, Stephanie Troeller and Mary Kate Mellow, who thought it would be great to bring the beauty and wonder of ballet into the lives of young children who otherwise might not have that opportunity. You gotta love the success of these ladies!

I LOVED how the ballet was explained to kids in an easy to understand story line and broken down into chunks that they didn't get bored with at all. My daughter was entranced with the first chapter and then advised me we had to stop the dvd so she could put her Wiggles ballet outfit on, so she could 'be a ballerina too'. When I started it back up it was the lesson time and she had a fun time dancing and following the young girls on the screen!

This is a super gift idea for any young girl- it's fun AND educational!",1268870400,,811,4.259740259740259
3269768,5,B000YRFLOY,"I reviewed this DVD for my blog Katie's Nesting Spot; I really liked the DVD format, it broke Swan Lake into several shorter acts with Princess Princessa appearing in between to lead the girls in learning a few simple ballet steps. These were demonstrated by students from the School of American Ballet, followed by the darling little girls showing off their own versions of the steps. It was a bit repetitious, the clips with Prima Princessa were shown twice in a row, but after some consideration I decided it was very age appropriate for my daughter. Sometimes it wasn't until the second time through that she joined in with her own moves.

The only drawback to this DVD, was that the storyline of Swan Lake did cause my 3.5 year old a little bit of apprehension, the evil magician scared her, but she's a bit of a scardy cat. I think most of her peers at preschool would've been fine with it, and she still liked the sections with Prima Princessa. Two more titles are due to be released this year; perhaps another story would've been better to start with.

I am really glad the video showed professional ballerina's in a performance setting, to show my daughter what real ballerina looks like. The forty minute length was perfect for her and we especially enjoyed the bonus feature of the baby swan dance. The overall DVD had a high quality of production and it's sure to be enjoyed by little ones interested in dance.",1268870400,,1422,4.616600790513834

Now I actually watched it by myself because my boys wanted nothing to do with it, but it is an adorable DVD.  The DVD puts the story of Swan Lake in a way that kids can understand and is told by an animated Prima Princessa as you see parts of the actual ballet going on.  Throughout the DVD there are also scenes of actual little girls dancing around and practicing ballets.  Ballet steps are also displayed for budding little dancers!

Overall, I thought Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake is perfect for any little girls.  It  is a great substitute for everyday cartoons and for the low price, you can't go wrong.  I also like that it is 40 minutes long so you really do get a lot out of the DVD.

I love the way the DVD is broken up. You actually get to watch the Paris Opera Ballet perform Swan Lake all the while Prima Princessa narrates the entire story so your kids know what is going on. After each act viewers are given the opportunity to learn some ballet moves. This is great because it was hard for my girl to sit during the actual show so when the time came and Prima Princessa declared that it was our turn she was up and moving quicker than you can say jete!

This is a really great way to introduce Ballet to children of all ages.  The video starts of with Prima Princess who narrates the story.  The video features the Paris Opera Ballet performing four acts of Swan Lake.  In between each act, their are children from the school of American Ballet who show you how to do specific ballet steps.  There are four steps taught:

  * Pirouette- to turn
  * jete`- to jump
  * pas de chat - step of the cat
  * grand battement- big kick

Each step is spoken and then illustrated by the child ballerinas, then there are scenes to reinforce what each step means.  For instance-Jete` means to jump, they then showed a cat jumping etc.  I really liked how each step was shown and then reinforced repeatedly.  In between the acts are scenes of small little girls dressed up in their tutus dancing around and laughing.
I really thought this was a great video, and even though it says ages 3-6 all my kids liked certain parts.  My older daughters (8) and (6) enjoyed the ballerinas performing, while the youngest (20 months) liked to watch when the little girls danced and played.

3269773,5,B000YRFLOY,"The whole time I was growing up I looked forward to going to The Nutcracker every single year. I even was in it one year. I also remember when my Dad took me to a fancy ballet as a Father-Daughter date once and how exciting that was! There's just something about beautiful ballerina's in fancy costumes and tutus that every little girl loves!

My little ballerina is no different! Although the Prima Princessa DVDs are recommended for ages 3-6 my 2 year old loved Swan Lake. We put on one of her 3 tutus (lol) and she'd dance along and kept asking for ""More more pallerinas!!!"" It was so adorable :)

The DVD is a mix of acts from professional ballet productions and little girls in tutus learning simple steps and dancing around. The whole story is narrated, so even as an adult you get what's going on ;) I actually learned a lot about the story of Swan Lake. I had seen the animated movie that came out when my youngest sister was little years ago, but hadn't realized it was a famous ballet that came long ago.

Prima Princessa jots from of a real performance of the Swan Lake ballet to a cute cartoon ballet dancer ""Prima Princessa"" who introduces ballet moves performed by little girls.

It's hard to describe it since it isn't like any other children's DVD I have ever seen, but my 2 1/2 year old dances right along with it and keeps wanting to watch it over and over again.

We had my nieces ages 5 and 7 watch it, and the 5 year old was interested but the 7 year old was not. I recommend this DVD for younger girls ages 2-5 who love dancing. My daughter (pictured above) takes ballet so that may have been why she loves this video so much she watches it twice in a row (it is about 45 minutes long).

I would describe the format of this program as similar to the baby einstein videos but much better. There are segments with real ballet footage that is narrated so children understand there is a story being portrayed in the ballet, for this one it is Swan Lake. My daughter especially liked seeing the younger girls dancing. The ballet steps are clearly shown and repeated. they are also reinforced creatively by showing the word, explaining what it means showing the dancers doing the movement and then showing toys, animals or other children doing the same movement. I wouldn't say this is a ballet lesson but just a simple introduction that is very entertaining for very small children. I will definitely purchase more from Prima Princessa.",1267488000,,824,4.9352517985611515
3269776,5,B000YRFLOY,"My daughter and I had a lot of fun watching the Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake DVD yesterday.  My four and a half year old gal took her first ballet class a couple of months ago.  It was a great experience.

Prima Princessa's Swan Lake DVD got my daughter all excited about ballet again.  The video does a nice job of combining footage of profession dancers, ballet students and young children.  The story of Swan Lake is shown in clips from each of the four acts.  The voiceover does a fabulous job of explaining the story as the dancers from the world-renowned Paris Opera Ballet perform excerpts from Swan Lake live on stage.  Between acts the adorable cartoon Prima Princessa guides viewers through ballet steps preformed by School of American Ballet students.  Then you get to watch young children (ages 4-6?) practicing the steps.

My little gal really enjoyed watching the professional dancers and following the story.  The summary at the end of each act really helped her follow along.  She also liked watching the students show the various steps.  Her favorite part seemed to be the scenes when animals were ""performing"" the steps.  She absolutely cracked up when a flamingo was doing a piroutte!  I was surprised to find her so entranced with the music.  She kept asking to have to sound turned up.  The 40 minute running time was just the right length.  The only part I would want to change is the section between acts when the children are practicing their steps.  It is adorable and got my daughter moving, however she seemed to want to have the ""encore"" showing of the steps shorter.  She said that she'd already seen that part and that she wanted to get back to the story.",1267401600,,1691,4.671186440677966

When we received our copy of the Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake DVD she was very excited. About 5 minutes in I knew that she absolutely loved it. She said and I quote,""There is a cartoon ballerina Moma! Oh and real life ballerinas Moma. This is the greatest ballet movie ever Moma. I love Swan Lake Moma. Moma!! It has ballet classes on here too! Moma, they even know the names of the dances like my teacher does!"" She loved it I'm still hearing tidbits of the story and about what dances she is learning. She has even started comparing it to her other ballet movies. I think she has a brand new favorite. I recommend purchasing your own copy for $6.99 its a great buy!

3269778,5,B000YRFLOY,"I have wanted my daughter to take ballet classes since she was born, but my husband says the same thing every time I mention it "" I cannot see paying $65 every month, when she can dance at home for free"". Men, they just don't get it! If I am being realistic I understand that as a family of six we really can't afford that, but I still want her to learn ballet.....

Enter Prima Princessa... If you are like me and want your little princess to learn the fine art and discipline of ballet but can't take out a second mortgage to pay for lessons (which I don't recommend) this DVD is for you! I can not say enough good things about it, but I will try!

First of all Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake is only 6.99, that is unbelievable for a DVD! Secondly the way it's put together is so simple (as in it interests my 22 month old) yet so sophisticated! I was quite shocked when I hit play and realized we would be watching actual ballerinas from the school of American Ballet preform Swan Lake, and I'll admit I wondered if it would keep her attention, which it did! I think I enjoyed watching it as much as she did!

But the best part (aside from the animated ballerina who narrates the DVD) is that it engages your little ""student"" of ballet and gets her involved in the movements all while teaching basic ballet terminology! It's like the Baby Einstein of ballet!

This DVD has really encouraged me to do all I can to teach her about ballet, even if I can't afford formal lessons! I even plan to buy the the Prima Princessa
Ballet For Beginners Book so I can learn more about ballet!",1266624000,6,1585,4.273333333333333
3269779,5,B000YRFLOY,"I am always looking for things my daughter can interact with and learn from.  When I received the DVD Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake I was amazed at how well my little one took to the video.

I like how the DVD would show parts and explain the story of Swan Lake. Then they would show the little children acting out the scenes. It showed some basic moves that the children could do and learn right along with them. They also had the word of the move they were doing on the screen so the kids could look at the word see how it was spelled and hear it pronounced and then they were shown how to do it. She really liked the cartoon fairy on the screen.

3269780,5,B000YRFLOY,"I have two divas within my household which are definitely princesses in their own right. They love to dance their own dance style, so I was thinking that they would enjoy this, but I was amazed as they started to watch how much they were engaged in the film.

Both of my girls had their eyes glued to the television and as they watched they loved trying out the dances that they were being taught. As an educator myself, I loved seeing the educational components within the film. This education was a true creative arts gem. It provided the opportunity for kids to not only learn about dance, but also about music and themselves.

By the end of the DVD my eldest daughter was telling me the story of Swan Lake as if she had seen it many times. So kudos to the moms who developed this DVD! Parents with kids who like to be creative and/or music and dance will love this DVD.

I truly encourage all of you to check it out today!

3269781,5,B000YRFLOY,"I admit it.  When I was a little girl, I wanted to dance my little tush off and spin around as fast as I could.  I wanted to make up routines and wear the pretty clothes.  Well, I never did get to be a little ballerina, but my daughter is now at the age of 5 and wanting to dance like a princess.

When Prima Princess sent me this DVD, my daughter wanted to watch it in the living room so she would have plenty of room to twirl around.  She LOVED it.  She loved the music, the ballerina's and the cartoon ballerina that narrated the movie.  She is even asking for tutu's and ballet shoes now.  She liked how they showed her different ballet moves and now she is anxious for Daddy to get home so she can show him.

The only thing is my daughter wishes it were longer.  It is only a 40 minute movie, and she was still wanting to dance! So I happily replayed it for her and she is enjoying it again.

A great DVD for your little princess, dancer or music lover child.  They will get 40 minutes of fun and you will get 40 minutes of peace!

Created by 2 stay at home moms, this video is targeted toward budding young ballerinas. The 4o minute DVD features a fun cartoon ballerina named Princess Princessa. Princess Princessa guides viewers through a performance of Swan Lake, which is performed by the world famous Paris Opera ballet. My 3 yr old started go get restless after a few minutes of the ballet, but her attention was renewed with the intermission. Between acts of the ballet, the video cuts to tutu-clad preschoolers dancing about outside. My daughter was mesmerized and wanted to get up and dance around herself. I liked how it got her out of the chair and dancing around. They also teach about the basics of ballet. My daughter isn't ready to learn the positions yet, but she did enjoy dancing around. I think I need to get her a pretty pink tutu so she can pretend she's in the video. So the younger ones can enjoy the dancing and Princess Princessa flitting around and the older kids can learn about the story of Swan Lake. I would say this is ideal for 3-8 years, although some older or younger might enjoy it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prima-Princessa-Presents-Swan-Lake/dp/B000YRFLOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake</a>",1239580800,2,1415,5.2105263157894735

My nice is both a ballerina hopeful and a card carrying Princess. So I knew as soon as I saw this DVD that she would be a perfect match for it. She hadn't even opened it before she was twirling around the room showing me her moves.

The video uses the ballet Swan Lake to teach children the basic ballet steps. The animated character keeps their attention and makes this a fun ballet learning tool. Your little ballerina, no matter what level they are at, will have fun learning with the other ballerinas from The School of American Ballet.

3269786,5,B000YRFLOY,This is certainly no ordinary children's video! Prima Princessa is educational and classy! It's like bringing a live ballet into your home and the perfect way to introduce young children to the art of ballet. I love that Prima Princessa narates each act so that children know exactly what's happening. I have to admit that I am in love with this DVD! From the sweet little girls playing in pink tutus to the fabulous music by Peter Tchaikovsky - ever little bit of this DVD is entertaining to the fullest! Even my 13 year old daughter was entranced by the live performances. You can really tell that Mary Kate and Stephanie put a great deal of time and thought into this awesome product and I heartily recommend that everyone experience it!,1239062400,,740,4.656488549618321
3269787,3,B000YRFLOY,"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old granddaughter after reading the rave reviews, but I was disappointed. Two aspects of the program left me wanting more. It was great to see the professional ballerinas, and also the (approx.) 10 - 12 year old students demonstrating the first positions and a few movements, but then they also continually cut to a group of 4 - 5 year olds dressed in tutus prancing around outdoors free-form and acting silly. These scenes are cute, but did not help my 3 year old relate to the fact that she is expected to follow the movements and instruction of her teacher when she goes to ballet class. It really would have been better if they had shown a teacher with the girls, and showed them at least attempting to follow along.

The second thing which I felt was not helpful to my 3 year old, was that during the demonstration by the older students of the first positions and a few movements, the producer continually cut to scenes of live animals to convey the concepts of numbers and movements. This really wasn't necessary, and just confused and distracted my granddaughter who was initially very interested in watching the student's movements.",1233792000,15,1172,4.661835748792271
3269788,4,B000YRFLOY,"The segments of Swan Lake performance included in the video are absolutely beautiful. I wish there were more. In between the segments the video shows 4-5 basic ballet movements, each demonstrated by ballet students and other real life objects doing similar things (like a top spinning or a tiger jumping). They are all nice to watch. The fairy that is leading the whole video has an annoying voice and laughter, but that's to be expected for a children's video. The 'audience' of the ballet performance are a bunch of little girls dressed up in tutus and they are silly and cute, just as they should be. A very entertaining video even for adult viewers. A nice way to expose your children to real classic ballet, but not one from which you would expect them to learn.",1219363200,3,767,4.647058823529412
3269789,5,B000YRFLOY,"My girls (ages 5 1/2 and almost 4) love to dance. If you have girls, you might have already heard of Prima Princessa. If not, here's the gist - It's a hybrid presentation on DVD. Part entertainment, part education. It may be more appropriate to say that it is education under the guise of entertainment. It consists of a presentation of Swan Lake by The Paris Opera Ballet broken into acts. The acts are further broken up by mini ballet lessons explaining and demonstrating different ballet moves. The entire DVD is narrated by a youth-friendly voice and cartoon fairy princess.

When I pulled out the surprise DVD for the girls to watch, their mouths dropped open and they were mesmerized. Not only did they pay attention to the ballet, but they asked appropriate questions: My (Almost) 4 year old asked - ""If he don't (SIC) find her, what's going to happen?"" They also repeated the tutorial words like ""Peer-oh-ette"" and mimicked the student dancers. I tried to take a few pictures but was chastised by my 5 1/2 year old when I tried to get her to hold still for a snapshot. ""Mom! I'm a Swan!""

When it was over, they both exclaimed in unison ""I want to do it again."" They both did a marvelous job on retelling the story even!

Another day, a neighbor showed up with her 4 year old daughter and 18 month old son, along with two 4 year old girls she was babysitting. After playing outside for a bit, I invited them in and we popped in Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake. If you could only have seen our family room filled with 6 children dancing along with the ballet and students!

The DVD was a hit with all the kids and I enjoyed it as well. I hate to admit that I've never bothered to watch any performance of Swan Lake so it turned out to be a learning experience for me too! I highly recommend this for any family with kids who love to dance.",1219017600,,1849,4.381924198250728
3269790,5,B000YRFLOY,"I was very fortunate to have been able to review, a wonderfully crafted DVD by two amazing moms from my old home state, New Jersey.

This DVD is just what this mom ordered. I took ballet as a child and have been recently trying to plant the dance bug in my 3 year old daughter's ear. You can only give her so many tutu's and princess things while asking ""do you want to take ballet this year?""

Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake features a cartoon ballerina who narrates Swan Lake for us. Swan Lake, being performed by the Paris Opera Ballet is beautifully done. In between acts, we are treated to various ballet steps all set to a montage of toys, animals, children and young dancers for the viewer to learn. My daughter particularly loved the segments of little girls running around and laughing in their tutus. This 40 minute DVD has enough to keep the preschool age child all the way up to Grandma's age interested.

I organized a play date with my girlfriend so that my 3 year old could watch it with a friend (a 9 year old dancer student). The plan was to have the girls watch the movie while we continued our own play date over at the dining room table with coffee and our laptops. We started the tape and were completely sucked in. So much so that we took our respective places next to our daughters and watched the whole movie with them.

While the movie was playing I heard my girlfriend's daughter tell her mom that she wants to stay in ballet (she had been thinking of dropping it because she doesn't love her teacher).

This is a great way to introduce dance to your little one or to reinforce someone's love for dance.

It provides a way to introduce her to the arts while also allowing her to feel like a princess, in the imaginary sense.
