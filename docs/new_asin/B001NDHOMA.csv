3712594,2,B001NDHOMA,"I'm being generous giving this 2 stars. It seemed to be part infomercial and part Dateline. I tend to learn most anything by reading books and supplementing with video. Instead of watching this guy's fidgety legs the entire time, they should have really focused on presenting the process itself. There were only a few pictures/graphics, and they seemed to be more eye candy than a true illustration of steps. A better plan would have been to use those two 'actors' for voiceovers with start to finish diagrams. They should have shown many more pictures and videos of the steps, setting up and maintenance (because growing is much more involved than with, say, cukes). This was like looking at an audiobook! Everytime he skimmed a subject, I thought, 'Now, they'll show an animation or picture to demonstrate'...but it didn't happen.

This seemed to be more of an outline, instead of a finished, detailed, and thorough guide. Even beginners need better. A superior starting point would be Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes, and many of the free resources out there online (like grow logs of the particular strains in which you are interested).",1330387200,,1138,4.989473684210527
3712595,3,B001NDHOMA,"This video is ok for complete newbies, but low-budget production and lack of any real information other than rudimentary basics makes this video a waist of time and money.

3712597,3,B001NDHOMA,The DVD offers some good basic advice on how to grow your own medical marijauna.  I think the video would have been more effective if it offered more illustrations on set up and what it will look like through its growing stages.  That is why I only gave it 3 stars.,1238457600,6,265,4.176470588235294
