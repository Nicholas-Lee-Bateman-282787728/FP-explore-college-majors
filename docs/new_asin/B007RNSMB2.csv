5109159,1,B007RNSMB2,"I chose this rating because the movies do not play in the US. I really think the seller should know this. If the seller did know this, it was wrong to sell them to me anyway. Hopefully I brought this to the seller's attention and it won't happen to anyone else. I ended up having to pay shipping just to send them back. ( which I think should be refunded to me also.) I was really disappointed because I wanted these movies so bad. Of course the purchase price was refunded in a timely manner, it still has me out of pocket for shipping the items back. Not because I didn't like them, but because of defects beyond my control. Also it looks like ([ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom ]) has been added to the description. Not sure if it was there when I ordered these movies or not. I only know I didn't see it, or I wouldn't have ordered them considering I'm in the USA!",1352505600,63,888,4.1686046511627906

5109162,5,B007RNSMB2,"The Twilight Saga took up much fame and popularity through 2008-2012. There was four books that were made into five films. Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn which was split into two parts. Stephanie Meyer the author of the novels is known for many other popular works but not as popular as her werewolf, vampire, and human love story. The Twilight Saga contained three main but very different characters, a shadowy script, heart wrenching emotion and favoritism.
 The films contained three main characters, Bella Swan, Edward Cullen and Jacob Black. Bella is a very pale, slender, brown haired girl freshly new to the Forks Washington area where her father lives after her mother decided to travel. Bella is very clumsy, stubborn and always has a habit of biting her lower lip. Many would say her acting is strange and does not fit the part very well. However I beg to differ, I think she portrayed the new vulnerable girl very well.  Next is Edward Cullen, the even more pale but seen to be glowingly and sparkling in the sun beautiful. His hair always seems to be messy throughout all of the films but his appearance is confident, with his muscular body and sharp face features. Lastly is Jacob Black, the childhood long friend to Bella. Jacob has many dark features like his hair, skin and eyes most likely originating from his Native American background. He represented this hot headed character through his acting very well to go along with his dark features.
By the first film Twilight it is known that the entire Cullen family had something weird about them and that weird thing was that they were all vampires. Never getting any younger or older, time was stopped at the age they were bitten at. After Bella and Jacob spent much time together working on bikes and doing homework Jacob started to distance himself and Bella knew something was up. By the second film Eclipse, is was also evident that something strange had changed within Jacob and his Quileute tribe, Bella soon found out they are all werewolves. Meyer had the intent that vampires and werewolves were the two worst sworn enemies of the century. This obviously proposed much conflict between all three characters when in time Bella had fell in love with each Edward and Jacob for many different reasons.
The majority of the plot is romance filled with not knowing which side Bella will choose, to be a blood sucking vampire forever or run wild with the werewolves? The two men obviously fight hard physically and mentally to do whatever they can to have Bella on their side. Everyone I know that has watched the film has chosen a favorite side, either Team Jacob or Team Edward. The one spat I could pick with Meyer is how important of a character Jacob is and how much his screen time lacked. Personally, I had always loved Edward from the start and it was evident to me he was the lead male. Jacob was always coming in second and I felt he never got the fair chance to be as of importance. He was that one step behind Edward for every little thing such as having to forcefully kiss Bella when she didn't want to just to see if there was anything there. It was hard for any viewer to see Jacob at equal standards although in the last film Breaking Dawn Meyer starts to realize his importance and his very vital part in completing the saga.
Ultimately, the battle between human, vampire, and werewolf will forever live on. You can pick sides and have favorites but in the end Meyer created the Twilight Saga for all aged viewing entertainment to what she knew the audience would come to fall in love with.",1411603200,2,3590,4.651968503937008

5109189,5,B007RNSMB2,"I don't know why it is okay to keep reviews here with telling not to buy from the UK??

You should rather tell people that there are countries on this planet who have different region codes for dvds and blu rays. And they should also know about their players at home what they can and what not.

If your player does only play region code 1 - which is for United States of America (you know, that big country in the west), than do not bother to look on amazon or whereever for movies NOT produced in USA!
In Europe they have like region code 2
Some countries in Asia have also region code 2
And then there is China and so on. Some have region code 3.

It would solve your problem if you would buy a region code free player. I can recommend OPPO blu ray player. Have a look on the internet. Yes, you have to pay more than 60 dollars for it. But it was worth it to get it for myself.

I love to buy from the States though I do not live there. I am happy that I can buy from amazon.com
Before buying ANYTHING you should do your own homework. Do not blame others for your own lack of knowledge. And this goes for everything in your life.

Keep it clean!

No reason to give it a bad review...it already says in the title description that this is a NON-US format Reg. 2 import. Just be sure to read what your purchasing carefully before you buy or if you have a region free dvd player you won't have to worry about it.

I had a difficult time with the seller as they did not understand that I did not understand about the different regions as I have never came across this. All they could say is that the region was marked on the product. Finally they agreed to take it back but I am still waiting for my return on my money.

5109198,1,B007RNSMB2,"These DVDs DO NOT PLAY in the United States! Do not be deceived as I and many others have been. You would think since so many have had the SAME problem, there would be a very large warning BEFORE your purchase is final stating that these do not work in the United States! Unfortunately, many won't read this until AFTER they are having the same problem. Why even bother selling this to the United States?! If they see the CUSTOMER has a U.S. address, they should not let you be able to purchase them! It would certainly save them and the customer A LOT OF HASSLE. I ordered these by looking at the title of what it was. I didn't go read product specifications for a DVD! It was NOT listed in the title of what I bought. This is deceptive to the customer and I don't think they care because they think half of us won't deal with the process of sending it back. I NEVER write reviews or do things like that. However, this time it really made me mad. I've never heard of ""regions"" or multi-region players or any of that nonsense. I did not know to ""look for"" information to make sure a DVD I bought would play in the United States! Why sell it to me if it isn't going to work here? But, rest assured, I will know from now on. I will NEVER purchase an item such as this online again.
