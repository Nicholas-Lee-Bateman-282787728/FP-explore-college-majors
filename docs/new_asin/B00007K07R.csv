1816769,5,B00007K07R,I was impressed by how the writers used both the last journey to Eisleben in 1546 and the prior 1521 journey to Worms as complimentary events.  The visual imagery was fantastic.  the narrators were powerful and their discourse was enlightening.  The comparison between the printing press and the internet was novel.  Jan Hus failed because he was before printing.  I have watched it over and over again.  Luther was a man who changed history - of course God's sovereignty over history and human events is apparent.  Luther should have failed.  But he did not.,1071619200,8,559,4.872340425531915
1816770,5,B00007K07R,"I saw the program on PBS recently which is why I am ordering the DVD .. for myself and to share.
I was raised Lutheran, turned atheist at age 12, became a Christian again at age 21.  I found this to be a wonderful presentation of the history I had some sketchy introduction to during my two and one half years of Missouri Synod Lutheran parochial school.
I hadn't realized how significant a part Luther played in stating basic doctrines (not theological, mind you) of individual freedom, worth, and self-determination.
Without Protestantism, there would have been no American Revolution.",1057881600,70,587,4.929292929292929
1816771,2,B00007K07R,"Why is it so hard for television to convey ideas? Everything is reduced to simple and unoriginal conflicts -- father/son, mentor/student, or husband/wife, without any suggestion people can have lives of the mind.
Watching ""Martin Luther,"" you'd think Lutheranism owes more to Hans Luther's alleged cruelty to his his son than Augustinian thought.  This idea of the Reformation as a rebellion against all father figures has dogged Lutheran studies since Freud; Heiko Oberman finally slayed the beast in his 1982 biography of the reformer, but the producers apparently didn't read that book.  There is some brief discussion of justification by faith, but hardly any attempt to place that thought in the context of earlier theology.  The restlessness of the German princes under the Pope is given only passing mention, and not a peep is made about Catholic reformers like Erasmus or Thomas More.  It's all Luther: neurotic Luther confessing six times a day, disillusioned Luther coming back from Rome, tired Luther preparing lectures, enlightened Luther sparking the rebellion against the evil, evil papacy with apparently no precedents to draw from.  Most of this, the documentary assures us, stemmed from his dad's cruelty.  It's Reformation as Oedipus complex.
The documentary gets Luther's, ahem, earthiness across, and accurately depicts his constant fear of the devil.  It doesn't shy away from his anti-semitism, either.  The talking heads are good but apparently belong to a mutual admiration society; a Roman Catholic commentator was desperately needed.
But the weaknesses make the film little better than an episode of Biography.  The obsession with psychology turns Luther into a 16th century version of Judge Judy (Luther: ""The pope should shut his mouth"" Judy: ""I said shut up!"").  Oberman's book will tell you more about Luther in its first hundred pages than ""Martin Luther"" will, and it doesn't have the Freudian obsessions of this movie.",1055116800,123,1951,5.3257328990228014

1816804,3,B00007K07R,"As noted by other reviewers, the program provides more than ordinary detail about Luther's life: his childhood, early adulthood, gradual movement into rebellion, and fights over religious matters.  Having earlier read a biography of Luther, I still learned more about him from this film.  Most striking to me is the consistent violence embedded in Luther's psychology.  Whether dealing with his father, his religious peers, the pope, the German peasants, or the Jews, Luther had an absolute compulsion not just to discuss or debate, but to destroy.  In his rigid extremism and inflammatory rhetoric he emerges as a classic revolutionary in the mold of Savonarola, Patrick Henry, Fidel Castro, Lenin, Thomas Paine.  There is a lot of redundancy in the comments by historians in the film.  It's enough to be told two or three times that Luther helped unleash the voice of the common man in religious matters; more than that merely turns the subject into jingoism.  We could gain more from the film if the other repetitions of this theme were replaced by more nuanced and illuminating reflections on Luther's historical significance.  For example, we are told that Luther's revolution spread to other countries and even led to the Puritan emigration to America for religious freedom. What we are not told is that upon obtaining their freedom here, they promptly set about denying it to others and killing those who who differed with them.",1486512000,2,1435,5.102564102564102

I'll begin by stating I have no dog in this fight. I'm not a Catholic or a Protestant.

History is not a science. It's always editorial, it's inherently biased, and it's impossible for us to receive historical information objectively. That's ok, let's just be honest about it and do what we can.

Now that's out of the way...

This documentary plays like is a retelling of David and Goliath at a Sunday School level. Little, brave, good Martin Luther vs. big, corrupt, evil Catholics. Cue absurd ""experts"" cheering on Luther likes he's their favorite sports team. They even go so far as to credit the Enlightenment to Luther single-handedly.

There are no alternative perspective offered, Catholic or otherwise. At certain points the experts, specifically the woman from University of Arizona, appear to be reciting Neo/Nazi talking points on the Catholic Church. Most of them don't go this far, but it's clear they only spoke to people who (literally) worship him.

Martin Luther was an important historical figure and, as a subject, deserves to be treated seriously and honestly. This show would have us believe Luther's entire life inevitably led up to his writing his Theses and that's it. No mention of his other quite discriminatory and distinctly un-Enlightened (authoritarian) views.

I think this sort of simplified, one-dimensional, antagonist storytelling is quite dangerous. Especially when it's presented by PBS and comes with that weight of authority. We learn nothing by simply being told what we would like to believe.",1458691200,2,1540,5.14

How can the history of Luther's revolution be presented without discussing this?  At one point the film stated that Luther said he had made it more difficult to get to heaven.  I am sure this was taken out of context.  The common people loved Luther because he declared heaven is a free gift, Jesus of Nazareth paid the price.  And the film barely mentioned why the Catholic church of that day believed as it did, in indulgences and so forth.  It mentioned I believe Peter's keys which I guess is what was exaggerated or grossly misunderstood to mean that the Catholic Church got to decide who would get into heaven.  Luther did not revolt just because of the corruption, his movement was based on what he read in Scripture.  Nonetheless, again, fascinating and compelling history, especially how he fearlessly risked his life.

I sometimes have a hard time sleeping - my dreams will go around and around and repeat themselves -even upon awaking, then going back to sleep, unless my busy brain is distracted.  When I want to break that cycle I turn this on the gold old Roku.

From the first tolling of the church bells to the dulcet tones of Liam Neeson narrating this series I am both lulled and enlightened. I've never watched all 2 hours all the way through, but I figure if I don't fall asleep at least my eyes are closed and I'm learning something.

Also good in this series, is The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization, Egypt's Golden Empire and The Roman Empire in the First Century.
So, Martin Luther scholars - don't flay me alive or send out a Papal bull,  but this is one very mesmerizing episode!

As one might expect, the history repeats itself and I think this story is not unlike what the Catholic Church has gone through towards the turn of the century with the allegations against many priests and bishops regarding abuse of young men.  Has the Church lost the trust of the people again?  Perhaps so.

1817252,1,B00007K07R,"I tried to watch PBS' ""Martin Luther: PBS Empire Series"" four or five times before I could get all the way through it. It is hateful anti-Catholic propaganda and it made me sick to my stomach.

I'm pro-choice. I'm actively gay friendly. I think I will encounter Jews and atheists in Heaven. I'm a feminist. I don't attend mass regularly. In short, I am hardly an orthodox Catholic. Even so, this documentary made me ill.

""Luther"" walks the viewer through Catholic churches. As classic Catholic images appear onscreen  candles, chalices, stained glass  horror movie music plays on the soundtrack. The viewer is shown images of a naked pope sharing bodily fluid (semen? mucus? I'm not sure) with horned Devils. Liam Neeson's authoritative voice  this is the Liam Neeson who saved Jews in ""Schindler's List,"" who rescued his daughter from slavery in ""Taken,"" who faced off with wolves in ""The Grey""  Liam Neeson's authoritative voice informs the viewer that, without qualification, the Catholic Church is corrupt, exploitative, false, and evil.

The Catholic Church is described as completely divorced from the wider population of Europe. In fact Europe itself WAS the Catholic Church. Peasants were the Catholic Church. Nobility was the Catholic Church. Merchants were the Catholic Church. Protestants were the Catholic Church. Luther was a Catholic priest, John Calvin was prepared for the priesthood, and Henry VIII was a defender of the faith.

Contrary to PBS, the Catholic Church was not an alien, evil, Italian institution that had nothing to do with Europe. Protestantism began as a movement within the Catholic Church. If ""the Church"" condemned or supported this or that behavior, that's because pretty much everybody in Europe condemned or supported this or that behavior.

The Catholic Church is described as being all powerful. Yet Luther, who defied the Church, died of natural causes, an old man in bed. Apparently the Church was not as all powerful and oppressive as PBS insists.

PBS tells us that the Catholic Church controlled innocent Europeans through the sacraments. PBS tells us that it was a really wonderful thing when Luther ""liberated"" Europeans from the sacraments. Uh huh. Tell a teenage girl that she can never marry  that she needs to be ""liberated"" from her wedding day. Absurd. Scholars like van Gennep and Victor Turner have described how rites inscribe belief and enrich lives. People want their sacraments.

PBS gets its message across, not just with Liam Neeson's narration, but with scholarly talking heads. These talking heads were the least charismatic talking heads I've ever seen. Miri Rubin was hardest to take, harder even than big-forehead-man with scary looking teeth, or receding-hair-mole-man who insisted that no one before Luther was an individual.

Rubin is excruciatingly self-dramatizing. She whispered. She raised her voice like a roller coaster. She made eyes at the interviewer. She wriggled her eyebrows. She thus, in cheap opera heroine fashion, communicated that the Catholic Church was just a big joke. Apparently Rubin focuses on anti-Semitism. An important focus. But is that all there is to say about Catholicism? It's fake and anti-Semitic.

I've traveled the world. People ask me my favorite destination. The ONE place I would return to is not the Taj Mahal, is not Jerusalem, is not the African rain forest or the desert. The ONE place I would go back to is Chartres Cathedral. Chartres Cathedral is a product of medieval Catholicism. Nothing that is mere corruption could have produced the most sublime place I have ever been.

During the Enlightenment, some wanted to obliterate Chartres Cathedral. Stone masons, forfending this abomination, argued ""It would take us years to clear the rubble from the streets."" Thus saving Chartres Cathedral from anti-Catholic campaigners who were blind to the sublime.

Who will save Chartres Cathedral from the bomb throwers at PBS?

Nazis quoted Luther's writing on Jews to justify their slaughters. Peasants were inspired by the Reformation to rise up against their noble exploiters. Luther knew that if the peasants had their way, his protectors would be shaken. Luther urged the nobles to ""whip, choke, hang, burn, behead and torture [peasants], that they may learn to fear the powers that beA peasant is a hog, for when a hog is slaughtered it is dead, and in the same way the peasant does not think about the next lifestab them secretly and openly, as they can, as one would kill a mad dog."" Erasmus estimates that a hundred thousand peasants were killed, with Luther's encouragement.

The documentary does mention these aspects of Luther's career, but briefly and as if they were  footnotes. Not essential. But they are essential. Luther was fond of hate speech, and spoke in the most violent and hateful way against Catholics. The wars between Protestants and Catholics that lasted for two hundred years, and the enmity that exists today, were sparked at least partly by Luther's intemperance.

Imagine this. You tune into PBS and see images of the interior of a mosque. You hear horror music, and Liam Neeson's powerful voice informs you, without any question or hesitance in his voice, that Islam is corrupt, exploitative, evil, and must be destroyed in order to save the Middle East. Would you not realize that you had entered an alternative universe?

Tell me then, why is it okay for PBS, a taxpayer funded broadcasting station, to peddle anti Catholic hatred like this?",1392508800,7,5485,5.119820828667414
1817263,5,B00007K07R,"I am amazed what Luther was able to accomplish.  Having grown up in Germany, I think that Luther's initial strict conformity to the rules (which is quite strong there) contributed to his disdain of the hypocrisy of the church.  This documentary tries to explain what drove him.  I am in awe of someone with the willingness and ability to stand up to the church, especially at that time, given it's power.  The re-enactments performed in this video are done well and help take the viewer back to the time.  The scholars who explain Luther are quite articulate.",1391731200,2,559,4.721649484536083

The Bad: There is a slight but palpable pro-Luther, anti-Catholic bias. As far as I could tell, all of the experts consulted are Lutheran scholars.  It misrepresents Catholic teaching on few points, most notably indulgences.  It confuses the abuses of the Catholic church that were current at the time with official Catholic teaching.

Our glorious leader was justified in founding his own religion because he was the most spiritual person of his age. You think I am exaggerating? At one point the narration actually calls Luther, ""this monk who had been the Church's most devoted servant..."" Really, where is the evidence that he was ever even simply a committed Catholic, much less a devoted servant, much less her most devoted servant?

Since Luther's 95 thesis are mostly fair questions concerning the abuses of indulgences that were going on at the time. The question of where Luther came in to conflict with the Church must lie elsewhere. I suspect that it was the combination of political intrigue combined with Luther's other writings that lead to this conflict. The Thesis' only role was in spreading the Luther's notoriety. However the program plays fast and loose with the truth. Sacraments are cunningly referred to as rituals giving a false impression about their true nature. If you don't already know you won't learn from this program that indulgences are only for the forgiveness of temporal punishments for already forgiven sins, which means that a sincere repentance would have already taken place. In fact this program does everything in its power to obscure what indulgences may or may not actually be. Considering this in light of the weight they put on Luther's thesis as the fulcrum of his career then it is absolutely diabolical that they would do this, and I mean that quit sincerely: if the devil were to defend his servant Martin Luther the results wouldn't likely be much different from this program.

Was Pope Leo X also a servant of satan? Yes. Is this surprising? No, I don't believe it should surprise any Christian considering how far we saw evil enter even into the ranks of Christ's chosen apostles, themselves, at the beginning. However Christ has promised that His bride would be preserved despite the sins of men of like Judas Iscariot, Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici and Martin Luther. This being exactly the point in how the Father of Lies works in this world to visit fresh evils upon it. His minions gets into the heart of a man like Giovanni then through Martin Luther's indignation they get into his heart too only to play both sides against the middle. Who suffers? The world suffers as Christ's church is chipped away at the edges and reality, itself, becomes distorted. When you combine the so-called ""reformation"" with other philosophical movements like modernism, men lose all sense of moral direction and you have the type of carnage we call the the 20th century.

The image of people, like some medieval Cultural Revolution, storming into the churches to defile the images of the Saints, who are in reality the instructional models of history for us on what true piety looks like in actual practice, says everything one needs to know to understand who really was the true author of the reformation. As we quickly approach 21st century's store of carnage the noise of more than 20,000 screaming and often hysterical voices of various Protestant ""faiths"" are drowning out John the Baptist's voice as his words can still be heard echoing through the ages.",1378684800,8,3335,4.8886925795053005

1817291,2,B00007K07R,"I love the Empires series (especially the one on Ben Franklin) and I'm a sucker for history programs but this one left a rotten taste in my mouth. Yes, Martin Luther is a fascinating and complex historical figure who challenged corruption, contributed to the Enlightenment, and made a substantial, positive impact on the world. The main and absolutely inexcusable problem here, though, is that in a documentary of an hour and forty-seven minutes, they spent less than one minute addressing the fact that Luther also repeatedly and in no uncertain terms recommended violence against Jews and is arguably the forefather of German anti-Semitism.

I am stunned that the Luther-loving ""experts"" completely ignored that ugly fact until a mere thirty seconds tossed into the last ten minutes of the film. I also noticed that the expert who mentioned it was shown just minutes later calling Luther one of the greatest ""emancipators"" of all time. Perhaps. But overall, the editing and interviews in this documentary horribly whitewash Luther's flaws and generally portrays him as compassionate but severe, when the truth (as is often the case) is far more complex and deserving of attention.

This documentary needed a Roman Catholic rebuttal (as other reviewers have said) and maybe, I dunno, at least one or two of the other Luther-lovers acknowledging the fact that, yes, the guy also encouraged his followers to burn down synagogues. As it is, I half expect the makers of this documentary to do another project on the conquistadors or Christopher Columbus that focusing on their bravery and makes only a passing mention of genocide right.before the credits roll.

1817316,3,B00007K07R,"As a fan of the Empires series, I had very high expectations for ""Martin Luther"".  I was deeply disappointed.

There are strengths to the show.  It is beautifully filmed.  The historical scenes, in particular, provide a fascinating and historically accurate view of life in early 16th century Germany.

Nevertheless, the documentary's weaknesses far outweigh its strengths.  First, its pace is plodding.  The director was clearly padding out an episode's worth of material to create two very slow, laborious, truly turgid shows.

Moreover, the experts in the show are poorly chosen.  Not only do they lack personality, they are actually unlikable.  The professors from the University of Arizona and the University of London come off as affected, arrogant, self-important, and overly dramatic.  Their performances detract from the otherwise fascinating historical story.

Most important, however, is that the show is unbalanced.  Although a Protestant myself, I always seek to teach the Reformations from a balanced perspective in my introductory European history courses.  This film suffers from an old polemical tradition of painting all of  Catholicism and Catholics as ""bad"" and Protestantism and Protestants as ""good"".

Most of the experts in the film are Protestant ministers and academics who clearly are fans of Luther.  That, in itself, would not be so bad if there were balancing voices from the Catholic side or, at least, if Luther's character flaws were more clearly presented.  Luther certainly was heroic and brilliant.  But, he was also foul mouthed, angry, stubborn, and brutal.  His call for the violent repression of the Peasants' Rebellion that he had unintentionally sparked set a clear tone for bloody minded authoritarianism that cursed much of German history through 1989.  Moreover, his vicious anti-Semitism provided an intellectual legitimacy to organized racial hatred that would underly National Socialism.

Thus, although the documentary has some worthy points, I cannot recommend it highly.  In particular, its slow pace and lack of balance make Martin Luther a poor choice for college and high school classrooms.",1348358400,4,2143,5.486238532110092

1817319,4,B00007K07R,"Important historical tale of one of the great original stand-up to power guys in history. Luther ""pulled the sheet off"" of the Pope's indulgence scam and that had the Pope wanting Luther dead. Sadly, like many revolutionaries, Luther quickly sold out to power. Luther thought he needed the protection of earthly power from the Pope and he got that protection from Prince Frederick III. Frederick had had enough of the Pope looting his kingdom in Germany for indulgence money to use to pay for the Pope's trashy lifestyle in Rome. Of course, like any tyrant, Frederick wanted to keep the loot for himself. So, Luther's revolt against the Pope's indulgences was the perfect answer to stop the Pope's looting of Frederick's kingdom.

Luther got protection from Frederick to ""preach the gospel"" and in exchange Luther gave moral authority to not paying for indulgences and stopping the cash flow out of Frederick's pocket as well as supporting Frederick's tyranny against a peasant revolt. As you will see in the movie, the peasants logically thought that since Luther revolted against the tyranny of the Pope, they had a God given mandate to revolt against the tyranny of Frederick III.  Luther, however, heartily supported the tyrant against the peasants and thousands of peasants died.

Luther's support of Frederick's tyranny began the Lutheran church's long standing support of tyrants so long as the tyrant lets the Lutheran church preach ""the gospel"". The Lutheran church's history of supporting tyrants include King George III of Great Britain in American Revolutionary days, Hitler and his Third Reich that murdered millions and USA's tyrants that have made wars against millions of peasant people in the USA and around the world. It would have added interesting historical continuity to the film to show how Luther's support of Frederick III laid the foundation for Lutheranism's sad historical record of never speaking up to and supporting tyrants. Based upon his support of Frederick III, Luther would have given Hitler at hearty, ""Sieg Heil!",1323993600,4,2050,5.168674698795181

It starts well and I was actually interested in what they were saying about the church and his personal attitudes in reaction to it. But it focuses on very few of the Ninety-Five Theses, obviously sticking to the safe subjects, not talking about how he was talking about starting a war between the rich and the poor with statements like ""Why does not the pope, whose wealth is to-day greater than the riches of the richest, build just this one church of St. Peter with his own money, rather than with the money of poor believers?"" And statements that suggest tithing shouldn't be like a tax.

Those statements are the crux of the separation that created the Lutheran Church, and with a title like ""Driven to Defiance"" I would think the documentary was prepared to discuss them, and his preaching of violent anti-semitism, and his musical talent, and well, why Luther was so legendary that a church is named after him.

1817358,4,B00007K07R,"Despite its modest budget, this PBS docudrama on the life and significance of Martin Luther manages to be accessible, engaging, and informative.  It combines a talking-heads approach--the testimony of six Luther scholars--with a flashback skeletal narrative--Martin Luther, played by Timothy West, reflecting on his life while on his ""last journey.""

Each of the scholars is more animated and communicative than is frequently the case in such documentaries, and their language, along with that of Liam Neeson's 3rd person narrator, is consistently direct and straightforward.  As Luther, West may be the weak addition to the mix.  His arch eyebrows, along with his curiously winking glances at the camera, make it difficult to tell whether he's sad, glad, pensive, apprehensive, or simply clueless about what he's doing in this movie.

Unlike at least three theatrical releases with the same title, this ""Luther"" makes little reference to Luther's wife, family and colleagues, but it does offer its own insights: Luther's anti-Semiticism, his support of state authorities who exterminated 100,000 rebellious peasants, and above all his strengths as a writer.  The Luther who emerges is a man of extremes but also an individual of heroic fearlessness, absolute integrity, and undeniable global influence.

Credit the striking, panoramic natural scenes and the music score (though too close to Phillip Glass for my taste) for helping the viewer forget that this is a movie in which much is told but very little happens.",1124582400,9,1517,5.4025423728813555

But it's almost painfully thin on content.  Details seem to be dropped in a mad rush to make things seem more dramatic than they are.  Complex theological issues are brushed aside in favor of what effectively boils down to a Good vs. Evil story, with Luther saving humanity for all time.

Really a bit of a dissapointment.  This is a documentary that really wishes it were a movie, and when it fails to be dramatic, it falls back on almost shameless lionizing of it's protagonist.  Would it have killed them to interview just one Catholic?",1114128000,8,642,4.6875
1817360,4,B00007K07R,"I enjoyed this program on Martin Luther, but felt that much of the story remains to be told.  It is two hours in length, but at this pace, it should have been four.

Only halfway through the show does Luther nail his 95 Theses to the Wittenburg church door; most of the episode focuses on Luther's developing faith as a monk, and his penchant for giving his all to every undertaking.  Finally his rage consumes him and he writes the Theses.  The second hour details Luther's struggle to be heard and his unwillingness to back down from his statements about the corruption in the Catholic Church at the time.  I felt the program did a good job explaining that Luther took this very seriously, that he felt people's salvation was at stake (if they believed in the power of indulgences).  It helps to understand why Luther was willing to put his life on the line, as he surely did.  He was THAT passionate about people, trying to save them from what he believed were grave errors.

But after covering Luther's appearance at the Diet of Worms, not much more is mentioned before the film ends.  I was surprised that virtually nothing about Luther's theology (salvation via faith alone) was covered.  It seemed that this program was more about the ending of an empire (the Catholic Church) than the beginning of a new one.  And that may have been the producer's intention, I don't know.  If it was, though, it should have been titled something other than just ""Martin Luther.""

1817362,5,B00007K07R,"I've looked over the reviews for this release, and I think I see two camps.
One is composed of Lutheran scholars - or at least those with an in-depth understanding of Luther and what he meant for the modern world. They seem to think this documentary is dull or simplistic.
The other (of which I am a part) know who Luther is, know of the 95 theses, and know that he was the major figure of the Reformation, but not much beyond that - the personality and figure of Luther himself, the level of pressure he was under, his effect on secular government as well as the Church, etc.
To this second camp, I think this documentary is a fabulous overview of the life of Luther and what immense influence he had over the course of history. It touches on the major points of his life and effect, and it NEVER seemed dull to me - quite the opposite.
As filmmaking, the documentary relies on original footage more than old drawings or paintings. The actors are good, although oddly, they never get to speak a line. It's all narration (Liam Neeson does well and the actor of Luther's voice is convincing) instead of direct re-enactment. It perhaps lacks the freshness of PBS's 'Benjamin Franklin' for this reason, and might explain why another reviewer found the documentary to be boring. In the end, I found this technique to be a very minor point of critique.
A final thought would be that the soundtrack on this DVD is top-notch - I would have bought a CD of it if it had been released.",1072656000,159,1475,4.446494464944649
