If you aren't at the peak of physical fitness, and you want to match the pace of Billy and his followers, you'll probably pass out from exhaustion. Although Billy will repeatedly ask you to ""ACCELERATE!"" make sure you go at your own speed. These are great core and cardio work outs, but it's better to be fit than to die trying.",1453593600,,470,4.413793103448276
8412122,4,B00405ITSQ,"Pros: I am sweating within minutes-there is no downtime, so it's a great compact workout-if you hit the forward button on each dvd it will jump straight past the ""how-to do the moves"" to the workout with music, so it's easy to access each real workout once you are comfortable with the moves-each workout is about 40 minutes so it is easy to fit in when you have time.

Cons: Billy Blanks (I don't mean to be harsh) but...#1) he can't count. Almost each exercise he'll say ""one more time"" but he almost always means 2-3 more sets of 8 which is irritating more than anything else, and it also means he doesn't always do equal sets on each side. #2) He doesn't always speak proper English. #3) the music is absolutely awful and not in any way motivating...music is everything.

These have been my go-to DVD workouts for years, and I do love them and always come back for them. I tried his elite and hated it-the workout bands were awful. I recommend using his 1 pd weights that came with my workout order for all workouts. It adds great arm resistance, and you can really feel your arm muscles working.",1372118400,4,1100,4.4405940594059405
8412123,5,B00405ITSQ,"Ive always loved Billy Blanks Tae bo workouts but sometimes I find them difficult to follow. These do have a long introduction to each workout but its easy just to skip that chapter when you've got the moves down. These videos are fun and they motivate me to push even harder. I didn't buy the kit so im not sure how long before your supposed to advance to the next video so I alternate all 3 of these so I don't get bored, along with ""billys favorite moves"" . Plus I feel tough after finishing one of these workouts!",1360108800,,517,4.232323232323233
8412124,5,B00405ITSQ,"Great workout! Fun, belief, motivation, and excitement. In shallow water, it lasts longer. Praying for better ends as time goes on.",1349827200,,131,5.285714285714286
8412125,4,B00405ITSQ,its definitely Billy Blanks style--Love the positive message--I want my chicken arms to look as tight and perfect as his.,1340236800,2,121,5.1
