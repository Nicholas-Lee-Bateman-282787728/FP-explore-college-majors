3949630,5,B002LYD2L2,I really enjoy the original series and the great service made everything even better! The price and quickness was amazing!,1365033600,,122,5.15
3949631,5,B002LYD2L2,This was a Christmas present for my fiance to complete his collection. He loves this box set and can't wait to finish watching the set.,1358640000,,135,4.44
3949632,5,B002LYD2L2,"Grandson loved getting this DVD for Christmas.  I was a hard DVD to find, wasn't able to find it in the stores, I was very pleased to find it online.  Now all I need is the other season's to make collection for grandkids.",1356998400,,221,4.116279069767442
3949633,5,B002LYD2L2,Ordered this for the mostly smile and giggle factor.  I cherish the things that are able to give me a smile.  The only complaint I have is this.....Why just a few episodes that I can select if I choose to watch just a certain episode?  Sometimes the episode I want to watch is not available there so I have to skip through a lot of other episodes to get to it.,1355270400,,360,4.042253521126761
3949634,3,B002LYD2L2,This season is great I recommend watching this before going into season 4 as the first 2 Dvd's take place before season 4 and makes the time placemnt out of whack,1320192000,,162,4.258064516129032
3949635,2,B002LYD2L2,"This in no way comes close to the greatness of the 2K animated series. I feel this era of the classic show now began to ""jump the shark"" because we find them traveling Europe & while the idea might be entertaining to some, it just comes off rather gaudy. And the fact that they run into Krang, Shredder, & the Technodrome all too often falls way too short of any creativity. Even when they're back on their home turf, the storyline pretty much treads the same tired formula. Nevertheless being a fan of Mirage Studios & the TMNT since like '84 I can certainly appreciate the humor on the show a lot more now than when I was a kid who yearned for the gritty, action packed, & introspective turtles of the classic comic books. The special feature on each disc is more like a 3 minute crash course on the world of the TMNT. Not surprisingly the best one's being new interviews w/ the creators Eastman & Laird who openly explain the differences between the comics & the show that TV exec's wanted them to re-imagine to be ""kid friendly"". Again, if your a die hard fan of this stuff I'd recommend getting this otherwise save your money for the upcoming ""Turtles Forever"" animated film or the recently released graphic novel collections from Mirage Studios.",1309478400,,1251,4.539823008849558
3949636,3,B002LYD2L2,"The Seventh Season of classic Turtles, with this set containing the European Vacation episodes that were missing beforehand.  While this season set has two ways of getting it, a full season set or by four volumes that feature a little toy turtle with each of the releases, which is nice if you want to have a little action figure to add to your collection.  Featuring 27 episodes in this season set, with episodes that some of the fans have been waiting to watch prior to this release.  I don't get as to why there were two ways of purchasing this season, though it seems like it was just a little marketing ploy that they dished out.  I just don't get why they would go about doing that kind of thing to the fans when both should have been released at the same time to give fans a choice from the start.  Overall this set receives a 3 stars out of 5.",1279756800,4,851,4.260869565217392
3949637,5,B002LYD2L2,Our grandsons ages ten and five have enjoyed this DVD and show it over and over and act out character parts.,1265155200,2,108,4.190476190476191
3949638,5,B002LYD2L2,"LionsGate has done right by the fans! All 4 slices in one box to make up for the horrible decision to separate the discs for sale!

Support this awesome reversal! Speak by purchasing the attempt to make things right!

Very pleasing.

5 stars, highly recommended!",1259971200,2,262,4.777777777777778
3949639,5,B002LYD2L2,"Lionsgate had previously released Season 7 on 4 seperate DVDs in which each DVD was supposed to be a pizza slice. The price point for these 4 DVDs was about $10 a piece which is quite high and not to mention 4 seperate DVD cases is a waste of shelf space. I know a lot of people were upset with the previous release and now it seems that Lionsgate is giving season 7 a proper release in one DVD set.

Here's hoping that Lionsgate will also go back and give season 5 a proper release with the 3 missing episodes restored and an actual DVD case instead of that ridiculous pizza box. A complete season 3 DVD set would be nice too as opposed to the 4 volumes that were originally released.",1251331200,16,685,4.1893939393939394

3949652,5,B002LYD2L2,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles classic series episodes, season 7. Gotta love these guys, young or old. These episodes capture who they were back in the day, and show why so many still love them, even now. If you don't have the original series, its totally worth getting.",1437350400,,268,4.723404255319149

3949672,5,B002LYD2L2,"What can I say, the cartoons today suck. And the new TMNT is pathetic at best. These are the original turtles that we grew up watching back in the '80s. I still enjoy watching them with the kids and sadly I still remember most of these episodes from when I was a youngen. Major win dudes. COWABUNGA!!!!",1399075200,,302,4.315789473684211
3949673,1,B002LYD2L2,"This set has the final two discs of REAL original Turtles. It also has two discs (The European vacation) that were so bad they would not air them at the time. Half of the voice talent is not the regular cast. I THREW THEM OUT. Stay away at all costs, and see if there's any way you can find just the final two discs.",1397088000,2,316,3.953125
3949674,5,B002LYD2L2,This is an excellent classic cartoon series. You will enjoy watching this and can share this with your family. It is a very family friendly show.

3949676,5,B002LYD2L2,Love it. Just got whole season 7. The xtras are awsome. they got interviews with all the voice acters. Its real cool all the behind the trutles so cool. I love the 80s trutles so funny. Plus its great to get the kids into the old tmnt. Great dvd must have.,1384473600,,256,4.03921568627451

I am disappointed in the damaged and beyond mangled case. This makes me question whether this truly was a new product or not.",1519344000,,285,4.296296296296297
8373349,5,B002LYD2L2,"As grandparent to a budding ninja, these DVD's are perfect. Cute stories and the cartoon version erases anything that may be a little scary.
