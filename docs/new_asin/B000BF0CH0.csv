2415064,5,B000BF0CH0,"Having seen all seasons, it was great to see this Christmas Special

that i never saw before.  The Christmas special is a must for your

collection.

When the series first came out, i said to myself ...oh no..here we

go again with a show, full of swearing and selfish actors ...but

all of a sudden lots of my friends suggested giving the series

another look...and i did.  Excellent has become the word of the day. The show provides alternative entertainment compare to lots of crap  out there.  I havn't seen one borring episode yet....i keep on laughing and amazed at Ricky ...bubbles...Randy and all others for the way they are improving and addressing their characters on the show.

I rather watch this stuff than murder and mayhem that lies on

the other side of the entertainment box.  Enjoy",1136937600,21,799,4.702898550724638
2415085,2,B000BF0CH0,You have to love TPB to like this special.  No new ground is broken and the tried and true jokes now seem stale.  Buy this to complete a collection only unless you just have a need to be moderately entertained for less than ab hour.,1326412800,,232,4.133333333333334
2415086,5,B000BF0CH0,"This episode is so good and explains so much and so little at the same time... No Ricky, God and Santa aren't the same person!  If you like the Trailer Park Boys you MUST watch this episode.  This was the perfect Christmas gift as we got to watch it Christmas morning.  Oh, my shipping was fast, earlier than expected and the condition was new and perfect.",1326067200,2,356,4.363636363636363
2415087,3,B000BF0CH0,"Of the whole seven seasons series, this Xmas special didn't quite impress me, or my family or friends.

I have the whole seven season series.  The least impressive episode to me might well be this Christmas special.  And why is that?

Well, I liked the TV series, and I thought that the video quality was fine for the series, but when they made this Xmas special, they actually choose to make this in some older looking reduce video quality to maker it look older.  Well, that certainly s*cked.  Watching this again after purchasing it over two years ago, I hate watching it because of it's poor video quality.  I hate it.  And the story just isn't interesting enough to even keep it to watch it during Christmas every year.  If anything, in the Special Features section, there is a 22 minute mini-documentary called ""Trailer Park Boys 101.""  This may help introduce other family and friends to the TV series itself.

I watched it with a friend, and I felt embarrassed for it's video quality.  The story wasn't interesting enough to introduce my unaware friends of the appeal of the Trailer Park Boys TV series.  They blew it.  Oh well, maybe Trailer Park Boys: The Movie, may capture their interest, but, this Xmas Special certainly didn't.

It's video quality really s*cks.  Wanna buy it off me?  Make an offer. I'm open......",1293494400,,1328,4.7043478260869565
2415088,5,B000BF0CH0,"Got this for a friend for Christmas and made her day. She added it to her collection of Christmas Specials. It is a must have. You'll laugh, you'll cry, it's wonderful.",1293321600,,168,4.451612903225806
2415089,5,B000BF0CH0,"This has now become required watching for me not only to complete each viewing the Trailer Park Boys Saga, but at Christmas time too!

If you're a TPB fan, this is a no brainer, you have to see/own this.

If you're not a TPB fan, it may not have as big an impact on you.

But either way, the message of this Christmas story is honest, heartfelt, and above all, true! Even in their unique and somewhat dysfunctional setting, the Trailer Park Boys loose site of what Christmas really means, and in the end, the least likely of messengers (Ricky) reveals what Christmas should be about to the residents of Sunnyvale Trailer Park. That's what makes this special required viewing for me at Christmas apart from being a TPB fan. This certainly helps get me into the spirit of the holiday.

But don't let that warm and fuzzy summary scare you away - because everthing up to that is pure TPB gold! It's stuffed full of what TPB fans love, and even adds some insight to a few characters (and one major prop) backgrounds.

Apart from being a Christmas Special, this also a prequel. Again, don't let that description scare you. This prequel managed to get do something most prequels fail to do - get it right!

I could go on and on with this review, but it would be a pure substitute to viewing it yourself. If you're a TPB fan and have yet to see this - you must! If you've seen it but it's been awhile, I highly suggest you revisit it again. It is the perfect Christmas Special for the Trailer Park Boys saga.",1286496000,,1500,4.377697841726619
2415090,2,B000BF0CH0,"Fans of the show Trailer Park Boys will not be disappointed with this movie. Marginal fans of the TPB will be. I turned it off after 20 minutes. My husband, however, a massive fan of TPB,  watched the whole movie and declared it ""dumb"". While I totally get the charm of the moronic, self-serving humor of TPB, this went above and beyond the call of idiocy. The party scenes in the jail were the best part - what does that tell you?? Don't waste your brain cells or your money unless you are a HUGE fan.",1281398400,,502,4.229166666666667
2415091,1,B000BF0CH0,"I've watched the first 3 seasons and every single episide is funny.  But this Xmas movie - I laughed 1 or 2 times in the whole thing - ONE OR TWO TIMES MAX.  Not funny.  I know people will buy it for the complete collection, but this was a poorly put together episode.",1280620800,,268,4.018867924528302
2415092,5,B000BF0CH0,"This is the video that launched the series.  You should start here to get a taste of the original characters.

There are extra features that stretch it out to 90 minutes, all worth watching twice.

It still makes the family laugh out loud.  Buy this video, and the other two (""The Movie"" and ""Coutdown""), in that order, right away!

2415112,5,B000BF0CH0,If you like TPB this Christmas special is hilarious. It shows you how things got the way they are and why in Sunnyvale.,1259971200,,119,4.217391304347826
2415113,3,B000BF0CH0,"All the bonus features like TPB's101 are probably the best part of the DVD. I enjoyed the X-Mas special&learning a lil' more background about the boys from the Park in this Prequel to the Amazing Canadian series...  Ricky delivers a sermon in the end of the show that is one of the best monologues of the entire series.  You get a look at a Pre- J-Roc aka Jamie. Before he became the loud ghetto talking HipHop wannabe, he had a whiney canadian accent, wore khaki pants(not Ka-Hay-key as Ricky would say)&sweaters his mother purchased&dressed him in. Layhe is still a cop&Randy is still a shirtless cheeseburger eatin prostitute....
If you are a real true fan this is a must watch&important addition to the collection. Although it contains several laugh til you pee moments, I will say that it's one of my least favorite episodes but in all honesty the special features make up for what the episode lacks.",1252454400,4,905,4.7215189873417724
2415114,5,B000BF0CH0,"I highly recommend this DVD. I do not recommend ordering it from Amazon.com., if you want the limited edition with the CONKY FINGER PUPPET. I was sent the regular Dope and Liquor edition, and when I returned it, they sent the same thing back. I again returned it and have not recieved the correct item or a refund in over a month.

2415116,5,B000BF0CH0,"This is a ""pre-quel"" to the TV episodes--presenting ""younger"" versions of the characters.

It also provides much information about various characters that have not been explained elsewhere (that I have seen!)--for example: what happened to Bubbles' parents, how Randy obtained his tight polyester off-white pants, and how the marriage of Barb and Mr. Lahey was ended.  One part was so funny that I kept ""backing up"" the DVD to watch it over and over and over again.

If you love ""Trailer Park Boys"" (like I do!) this is a MUST-SEE.

2415118,5,B000BF0CH0,TPB was available in the US.  It ran briefly on BBC America.  They did not promote it.  I have been a fan from the get go and own every episode and movie.  I am a huge fan.  My Canadian friends think I'm nuts.  The episode at the Rush concert was an absolute hoot.  Makes me want to sell my house and move to a trailer park again....they are really like that!,1198108800,,359,3.971830985915493
