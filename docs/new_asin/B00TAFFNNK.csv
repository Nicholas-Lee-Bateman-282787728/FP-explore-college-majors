In terms of acquiring knowledge of our complex new technology, I can not think of a better example that demonstrates this adage than James Bendewald's instructional DVD "" Phantom Knowledge"" for the DJI Phantom.

Documentation and user manuals are obviously important, but they can be very frustrating. Those who write them are ALREADY well familiar with the product and at times lack the perspective of a newbie who may need more to assimilate the material. Frankly, even after having read the user manual for several weeks, the thought of sending this $1,400 phantom to the skies Gave me the jitters.

The "" Phantom Knowledge"" DVD gave me a visual perception of how to handle the basic and important aspects of flying the drone. James' instructional narrations are well presented, comprehensive and easy to understand.

I played the DVD on my large TV screen, with all the Phantom equipment on a table in front of me. My ""Fear of Flying"" was soon replaced by an eagerness to go out there and do it. I have since then flown my Phantom successfully numerous times, and received high praise on the resulting videos.

I figure that if studying the "" Phantom Knowledge"" DVD prevented even a minor ""beginner's crash"" of my Phantom, then I got my money's worth.",1436486400,,1292,4.806306306306307

8701142,5,B00TAFFNNK,"I recently purchased a DJI Phanton Vision 2+ quadcopter from B&H.  Knowing nothing about quadcopters I noticed this DVD in accessories it looked interesting so I placed it in my cart. A decision as it stands now that was a excellent one indeed!  The video is well organized and very informative. It takes you from setting up your Phantom with the DJI software, configuring your smartphone thru your first flight. This DVD woud also provide valuable insight even for experienced Phanyom users.  The Phantom is by no means a toy but a sophisticated piece of electronic engineering.  It has many settings that I might have never known without this DVD.  While there is literally endless vidoes on youtube these 2 DVDs have it all in a nice flowing understandable format.  It even goes into photo and video.  I am an avid Lightroom user and there was a chapter on that.  So... if you are thinking about dropping this dvd into your cart - DO IT!",1426636800,,940,4.654545454545454
