8335659,5,B001QGN9N2,Awesome live Big Band recording in a club in New York City.  The band is loaded with New York Heavyweights and this DVD doesn't disappoint.,1415404800,,139,4.56
8335660,5,B001QGN9N2,"I saw this amazing big band live and I've been trying to purchase the ""Live in New York"" DVD but It is not in stock everywhere I have looked online.  Why???  There are videos from this DVD on youtube, but I would like to get the DVD!!!  If there is anyone who has a used one for sale, please put in on amazon, and I will buy it from you!",1368316800,,337,3.7857142857142856
8335661,4,B001QGN9N2,"This is an solid group lead by a very talented drummer. There are several fresh, exciting arrangements that also give life to this DVD.  I would like to see this group recorded with better balance on all microphones and with more space to allow better video work.  I will also always wonder why are the tunes listed on the cover not in the order played on the DVD? Yet, having said all that, it is a prized big band purchase that is watched often.",1318118400,,447,4.309523809523809
8335662,5,B001QGN9N2,"Tommy Igoe is well known within the drumming community as one of the premier teachers of the art.  You usually can't get to that level of recognition without also being a pretty good player.  It's not necessary to be a great player to be a great teacher, but it helps with the ""street cred"".  This DVD shows that Mr. Igoe has more than enough street-c.  His talents are right up there with the absolute best of the best of the drum-kings including Weckl, Gadd, Smith, and Colaiuta.  Don't believe me?  Just get this DVD and watch.  This guy has so much musical talent....he plays so musically, with so much power and speed -- but always within the context of the composition.  In addition, he leads an absolutely incredible band.  Not only is this DVD a must have for any drummer, anyone who would enjoy a phenomenal big-band performance should have it too.  Every other member of the band is up to the incredible standard set by Mr. Igoe.  The only bad news is that after seeing this DVD, you'll probably have to add a trip to NY and the birdland jazz club as another ""must"" to see the band play in person.  Until you can arrange that, get this DVD and enjoy it over, and over again.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  Can't wait for the next CD or DVD from the band!",1297814400,4,1267,4.313559322033898
8335663,5,B001QGN9N2,"The Birdland Big Band, featuring Tommy Igoe on drums and a team of superlative jazz players will knock your sox off! Whether it be a driving, modern jazz tune, a Basie piece or a fabulous Latin composition, you will have a hard time keeping yourself from tapping your feet and sitting still. This band is riveting with all the drive and sound of much larger bands and even the classic bands of yesteryear.
The selection of songs are quite eclectic and played to perfection. The soloists are amazingly gifted and show off their talents throughout each performance.  I've seen them twice now and man do they cook!",1291075200,4,611,4.710280373831775

8335665,5,B001QGN9N2,"Great energy canalized and directed by Tommy. Very good musicians with powerful energy. Very good music.

A Must Have !!!",1274054400,2,121,5.05
8335666,5,B001QGN9N2,"If you are a fan of swingin' big band music, then this is definately a must buy. This band really swings, the arrangements are great, and the soloists are superb. Tommy Igoe combines the chops of Buddy Rich and the showmanship of Gene Krupa. If you had to single out anyone in the band, the percussionist and the bass player are outstanding, to say nothing of Igoe himself. I say, Buy it!!",1247529600,5,389,4.416666666666667
8335667,5,B001QGN9N2,"Normally I prefer audio of big band and jazz CDs. I find the images distracting and prefer to let my imagination fill in the holes.

Not so with this his fantastic remarkable DVD. It is or should be living proof that jazz and the big band is alive and well. This is a stunning set incorporating the talents of top NY musicians who earn a crust in the pit for top broadway shows.

The program is epic, so much excitement and passion displayed. The presentation reminds one of the bands of Herman and Rich (the latter when he is enjoying being there). Sorry Rich fans!

Tommy Igoe is not one drumming 'one-trick' pony. He displays excitement,musicality and sensitivity that not every drummer shows. He has fun, he enjoys everyone's contribution to the music.

When he does solo his technical ability/musical sensitivity and need to have a good time, come together. People who see this band every week are so lucky.

Get the CD as well for the car, the tracks are slightly different.

FAULOUS!!!!",1245456000,6,993,4.67816091954023
