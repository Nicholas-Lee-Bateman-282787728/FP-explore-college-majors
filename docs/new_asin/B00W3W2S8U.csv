7119522,5,B00W3W2S8U,"The A List, whats to say ?. Another sweet teen movie with so much authentic feelings of awkwardness, inappropriate dialogue, youthful superficiality, but most of all a lot of heart & joy. The A-List is another small teen movie gem that will be discovered on DVD and online streaming, It kept a smile on my face the whole way through, laughing at some unexpected moments of dialogue from inappropriate comments from a wannabe cool high school principle, awkward geek, awkward guidance councilor and the cool popular kid who figures out what's really important.

I Loved the cast of actors but for me Elizabeth Bond as Sylvia Martin was the heart of this movie, an awkward guidance councilor who oozed so much awkwardness it made a normally cool man feel what it might feel like to carry around lingering old High School scars.

If you loved ""The Duff"" or you just would love to see yet another sweet teen comedy, ""this movie will warm your little heart"".",1435536000,4,953,4.734939759036145
7119523,2,B00W3W2S8U,"Complete waste of my time as am adult. I was not aware of age clasiffication
This movie is  considered a three or more stars for a young highchool age category with good reasonable acting.
not just the type for higher age movie watcher.",1434758400,,236,4.488372093023256
7119524,5,B00W3W2S8U,"The A-List is a fun, carefree, and engaging movie.  The characters are well defined, and the acting is first class. Actor Hudson Thames plays the lead Eric Schultz with great charisma.  The nerdy guidance counselor is portrayed by Elizabeth Bond.  At times the viewer might consider her a stalker, but yet you can't help but LIKE her.  Skyler Vallo demonstrates style and finesse, stepping into the role of the fashionable, yet conniving role of Hannah Ford.  She was also in The To Do List, but this is a much better role for her level of talent.  Viewers will be instantly transported to a past, current, or a future high school experience.  There are many laugh out loud moments.  I would compare this viewing experience to watching Easy A or The Breakfast Club.  The film is well done!",1434499200,5,789,4.700729927007299

7119538,1,B00W3W2S8U,"This would make a hilarious horror movie, but it's not a horror movie, so there is ""...no joy in Mudville."".",1524528000,,108,4.45
7119539,2,B00W3W2S8U,This is a really weird movie. It touches on some good points but isn't executed well. The acting isn't terrible but the story line is.,1523232000,,134,4.4
7119540,3,B00W3W2S8U,"This one begins awkwardly with a rather heavy-handed prequel. We then segue into the present and meet the rest of our protagonists, mainly students in an incredibly bizarre high school. Faculty is so off-base it strains credulity and the students are dominated by ""The A List"", an online ranking of who's popular today. That part is almost believable as a critique of the peer-pressure and cravings for acceptance dominating the high-school experience.

Near the end of his senior year popular boy Eric Shultz discovers he's a class short of graduation. Sylvia, his guidance counselor, discovers him to be the son of the man who broke her heart. She has her own list, things she always regretted not doing during her years at the same high school. And so she proposes a deal, fulfill my list and I'll doctor your record ...

The turning point is when Eric (I'm not gay!) takes the quarterback out on a date, his first item on the list. The awkwardness rises to a crescendo and suddenly we're onboard with the whole premise. Not sure what really makes the difference but suddenly the wackiness is working for the movie and not against it.

From that point on things are moderately entertaining and by the end of the film we are even cheering the characters- well, some of them. Interesting story. Wish it could have been told it a little better.",1499126400,5,1344,4.735042735042735

7119542,1,B00W3W2S8U,"This movie was like an infected wound; vile, disgusting & concerning yet you can't look away.  This movie is a perfect example of what not to do in a teen drama.  I need to take a shower to wash off all the uncomfortable scumminess that is this movie. P.s. This is not a Cougar guidance counselor story, despite how the blurb makes it sound. Honestly, it would have been less weird if she was a cougar.",1469232000,4,402,4.276315789473684

7119546,4,B00W3W2S8U,This is a cute movie. It's not what you would expect within it's genre. The guidance counselor comes off a bit creepy though I think she's suppose to be awkward. She essentially blackmails a kid to get everything that she wanted to in high school. I would watch it again.,1452124800,,271,4.44

7119558,5,B00W3W2S8U,"You would have to see this film to really appreciate it. To be about teens in school and life concerning such, it is OUTSTANDING! Really typical of how some people are, how they hold onto things, cant let go, and obsess, with the worst of these being a teacher- guidance counselor- ?. Cons a popular senior ( so he will be able to graduate) into fulfilling a list of 5 or 6  things she wished she had done or was able to do while she was in school . Didn't dawn on her until after the 4th thing that she was the one in need of counseling. More mature movie than you would suppose.",1442880000,2,580,4.087719298245614

7119563,3,B00W3W2S8U,Entertaining story. I was surprised.,1438473600,,36,6.4
7119564,4,B00W3W2S8U,"""The A-List"" feels like two stories: the first is a cautionary tale about making a pact with the Devil, which never turns out well.  Halfway through the movie, the Guidance Counselor/Devil regrets her behavior, and the story foregrounds the truly evil person: the female media genius who's in charge of the mythical high school's online ""A-List.""  As the story becomes more realistic in its portrayal of present day celebrity worship, the school becomes an obvious fantasy land, where the foolish principal is master of ceremonies for a VIP award event that looks like a mini-Academy Awards in Hollywood.  I found the movie subversive, funny and thought provoking.  If I were rating this movie, I'd give it a PG.",1438300800,,712,5.008474576271187

8711967,1,B00W3W2S8U,"Enough cringe-worthy moments to let you know, this isn't some slick Hollywood production. Mostly enjoyable. Mostly impressive. And silly. Annnd, if it weren't for some really inappropriate plot elements, it would have 4 stars from me. As a parent, I wouldn't recommend anyone watch this. As a retired counselor, I'm embarrassed to see how glibly it presents unethical behavior as comedy. Yes, the counselor should have been fired. So should the principal. And both would end up on the sex offender registry for their behavior, but instead are painted as sympathetic characters, and even role models. So, because of that major flaw, I can't endorse the A-List.",1530316800,3,659,5.168224299065421

8711969,4,B00W3W2S8U,"An other character error is that the math is wrong. The kid's got to be 17 or 18 years old and '93 is a decade away from 2013. They either had to have had a kid pretty early, or just magically got a 7 or 8 year old kid appear.",1528588800,,226,3.54
8711970,2,B00W3W2S8U,"I can watch pretty much anything. But i got turned off this movie relatively early. Maybe it gets better but I feel no great urge to discover if it does. I used to be a teacher and I will admit that some of the teachers i knew while as a student and as a teacher had some serious maturity and/or cruelty issues. But the guidance counselor and the principal characters were so skeevy, i couldn't go on. The not-to-suprising turning stereotypes on their heads were pretty stereotypical as well.",1528502400,,492,4.53932584269663

8711976,5,B00W3W2S8U,"Most esp the principal. But I guess he was just basically voicing what high school students go through. The counselor was so out of line and at the same time, felt her pain. I'm glad the student having to complete the list was not negatively disturbed psychologically. It made him stronger as a person and made him understand that we should stop 'labeling' ourselves and worrying what others think. Overall, it was a very good movie.",1525305600,2,433,4.7105263157894735
