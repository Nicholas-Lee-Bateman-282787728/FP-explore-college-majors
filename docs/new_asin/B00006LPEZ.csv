7971725,5,B00006LPEZ,"The first episode starts off with all the teachers getting their salarys - but the vice-principal's is stolen.  Without any evidence one of the boys is 'implicated' and this causes a revolt by the male students.  How will Hibiki solve the problem before it gets out of hand?
The second episode has the class going on a camping trip.  The boys decide to tell the girls they love them, mostly seeming to pick the girls at random.  One of them even decides to hit on Hibiki.  While filled with humor, this is where the relationships between the students becomes clearer.
The last episode continues where the last one left off.  But soon the students find out that they are all in love with somebody else.  While this 'somebody loves somebody who loves somebody else who loves somebody else' plot is common within anime, sometimes being the sole plot of many anime and manga, this is just an added complication to an already confused mess.  Not only does Hibiki have to deal with pretending to be a woman, and all the issues that brings up, like being a fake, but now Fuko has fallen in love with him and he is having feelings for her too (even if he isn't honest enough to believe it).
I do like the fact that Fuko's love is not just dismissed as a crush and that Hibiki thinks so highly of his teacher-student relations with her.  Not that he dismisses the age issue, but he is a teacher above all else and this really helps bring it out.",1058832000,2,1436,4.429657794676806
7971726,5,B00006LPEZ,"I was already laughing like crazy through all the other DVDs, but this one really hit the funny bone hard.
The first episode was about the male students finally taking some action after one of their friends was accused of stealing the vice principal's salary.  They go on strike and deface the bust of the principal's grandmother, who started the school.  Hibiki is upset that the principal and her right hand are prejudice against males, so he decides to settle the matter with the help of Ba-chan.  The two perverts of the boarding house come to distract the police.  Hibiki calms down the problem by sacrificing something valuable (poor dog!)!
In the next episode, the class goes on a camping trip.  The guys decide they are going to tell some girls that they love them (one who happens to be Hibiki-chan!).  Tensions flare hilariously.  The vice principal can't take it, so she comes to the girls and tells them what men ""really"" want from a woman.  During all this, is Hibiki having feelings toward Fuko?
Finally, the last, cliff hanger episode is where Fujio starts really crushing on Fukae.  But wait!  It seems like Fukae likes Fuko.  Finally, Fujio gets the nerve to tell him her feelings, but Fukae tells her he likes someone else.  Fuko walks by, and he tells her his feelings.  But wait again!  Fuko likes Hibiki.  Gosh, if it could get any crazier, Hibiki walks by, but he runs off.  All this heartbreak!
Anyways, these are sort synopsises of these wonderfully drawn episodes.  I totally recommend this HILARIOUS series.  It's kinda preachy with its messages, but it is also really funny.  The characters are mostly realistic and likeable.  The animation is beautiful.  The dub is surprisely as good (maybe better) as the sub.  I can't wait to see what happens to Hibiki!",1042156800,4,1784,4.761437908496732
