6601362,5,B00MU1YEJK,"Well done! I really had no clue what to expect. Hadn't heard of this film before. I didn't even know what language it would be in, if it would have subtitles or what (turns out it's from New Zealand, in English). This was great fun all around. Acting and screenplay were both solid. It was a perfect treatment and blending of comedy and thriller/suspense. And it kept you guessing right up to the end, with lots of twists and turns. You obviously have to suspend disbelief in a couple places, but everything is done so well, it's really not hard to do.",1413763200,6,552,4.421568627450981
6601363,5,B00MU1YEJK,"I enjoyed this movie allot, it reminded me of ""The Innkeepers"" (2011),and ""The Pact"" (2012).  A funny lighthearted but creepy comedic horror that keeps you jumping till the end.",1413763200,5,177,5.103448275862069
6601364,4,B00MU1YEJK,"I took a chance on this one and although it wasn't my cup of tea (I like my horror served straight up),  I was truly taken by the lead actress and therefore am writing this review to give her ""Bravo""!  I thought the actors (particularly the lead) did a brilliant job and the comedic timing was unbelievable.  They (particularly the lead) are spot on with extremely long, very intricate stunt work / routines and they never miss - absolutely amazing to watch such talent.  The story moves along and like I said, it's more of comedy-suspense.  So, if that's your thang baby - don't miss this jewel, I'm no expert but was impressed.  Kudos!",1413763200,17,637,4.543859649122807
6601365,5,B00MU1YEJK,"This movie was a huge surprise. My roommates and I watched this on a whim one night, and I'd highly recommend purchasing this on a whim as well- it won't disappoint.

The movie is categorized as horror/comedy, and at first we were confused as to how a horror film was supposed to be comedic without being stupid, like with the ""Scary Movie"" series, but we weren't let down. The humor comes so unexpectedly during the length of the movie that I was laughing out loud the entire time. It almost has a Simon Pegg sort of feel to it, but from the opposite side of the globe.

The horror doesn't necessarily disappoint, either, but you WILL be disappointed if you watch this under the assumption that it will be frighteningly scary during the entire movie--come on, it IS partially a comedy. There were definitely a few parts that made us jump and swear, though, especially during the beginning of the movie before the comedy sets in.

The acting, in my opinion, is perfect for the movie. Kylie, the ""heroine"", is the right amount of overly-dramatic and hostile (as anyone under house arrest would be), and her mother Miriam is completely passive and utterly hysterical. The other characters are ingenious in their own way, as well, and the movie ends exactly as you would expect a (slightly less) horror/ (slightly more) comedy/ Simon-Pegg-style film to end.

I loved it, and I pre-ordered the same night we saw it. I mean, for heaven's sake, it's only $10, GET IT and love it like I did!",1413763200,49,1484,4.6311787072243344

6601367,5,B00MU1YEJK,"I love movies like this one where you find yourself laughing and occasionally jumping up in surprise. The protagonist, Kylie is this pissed off chick who is on house arrest at her mom & stepdad's home. Her mom believes the house they've been living in for decades now is occupied by ghosts. Kylie is a bit more realistic though. However, Amos, the security guy who keeps tabs on her ankle monitor isn't much better than Kylie's mother. He starts helping them investigate the paranormal situation that's going on in the home. I don't want to give too much away, but as things start to become more creepy Kylie starts to become somewhat of a believer. When she finds out about a secret her mom's been keeping, Kylie decides it's time to settle this haunted house thing once and for all. This is when the movie starts to become real interesting. Twists and turns, quirky characters, decent acting, great plot, and humorous dialogue. This baby is a gem!",1413676800,90,949,4.688622754491018

But it turned out to be a wonderfully surprising, laugh out loud, funny movie, which still packs a lot of scary moments.  Give yourself a treat and watch this film.  I think it is okay for kids 10 years old and up, if you don't mind them hearing some profanity.  I've watched it three times now and still enjoy it.",1502496000,,432,4.283950617283951

Great haunted house movie with a good story and good acting digresses into a silly +++Spoiler+++ person living in the walls movie (extremely similar to ""The Boy""). The movie gets so silly that it's obviously aware how far it's gone and tries to poke fun at the genre but it falls flat and becomes nearly unwatchable.",1477958400,,399,4.797101449275362

6601393,2,B00MU1YEJK,"This was working so well for me and then it gradually turned into a mess. Don't get me wrong, please; I WANTED TO LIKE IT. Virtually every actor in it was superb. I just felt there were too many parts where, having established such a believable main character, the filmmakers abruptly had her do things that stretched way past credibility for me. (if you've seen the film, I felt this started to happen when she took it upon herself to retrieve a certain item inside the neighbor's house. even if she WAS a gutsy, small-time burglar, why the heck would she risk what she did? It didn't work for me.) And then there are the twists and turns and revelations in the plot; I felt there were too many of them. I don't mind having my conception of what's going on being pulled out from under me but this was gratuitous. There were distracting plot holes (there's a certain character who I swear should've been dead or at least crippled based on what was done to him), excessive exposition dialogue (""I'm suddenly going to explain my life story to a stranger despite my seeming to have kept almost entirely to myself for YEARS"") and then there's the gore... I've seen several New Zealand genre films that get quite splatter towards the end. I question the choice of one effect which just seemed way too much (and left me wondering how the survivors were able to prove to the authorities that it was warranted!). HOWEVER, check it out for yourself if you don't might a lot of black humor, a lot of silly humor, at times thick regional accents, and violence. The actors really ARE quite good. Especially those playing the
girl and her mother. I'd watch it again just for them.",1474329600,,1667,4.541528239202658
6601394,4,B00MU1YEJK,"You think you've seen every movie plot out there and you're sure you know the direction this one is going.... Nope, hold on to your hat! Meta score on IMDB of 83 for a reason. Scary, thrilling and funny mystery.",1471392000,,211,4.3
6601395,5,B00MU1YEJK,"The movie is hilarious and entertaining, however, as a person who uses ""Is the ghost real?"" as the yardstick for whether a movie has value to me, I checked out of this film at one hour, twelve minutes, and thirty-five seconds.

I have an unusual relationship with death, a relationship that requires constant confirmation, and any confirmation will do.  This is the foundation of my love for paranormal horror.  ""Real"", however, can have an amorphous definition, consider it as; if there is no way to argue that the ghost is ""real"" at least IN SOME WAY, then the movie has no value to me.  The stuff and things happening in the movie are either because of a ghost, or because of something that everyone thinks is a ghost but that we ultimately find out is because a man is living in the walls.  I am immediately no longer invested in a film once that moment happens where the paranormal phenomena are revealed to be nothing more than raccoons in the attic and bad wiring and that kind of stuff.

Why am I telling you this?  You aren't reading this review to hear what all the other eight million reviews already can tell you.  You don't know me any better than you know any of the reviewers on here, so you have no more reason to believe my opinion over theirs or vice versa.  Now, I can't tell you anything about the use of camera angles or the...whatever else people use to judge movies...but I can tell you that the ghost isn't real, and if you are like me, if your enjoyment of paranormal horror depends upon whether or not the ghost is real, that's more useful to you than camera angle stuff.

AND...in my opinion that is a very useful thing to know, considering the fact that, for fans of paranormal horror, meaning people who prefer specifically PARANORMAL horror over other sub-genres of horror, in general your enjoyment is dependent on whether or not the ghost is real.  You either, because of your relationship with death and the afterlife, need something, anything, to tell you that ghosts are real, or you need something to tell you that they aren't.

In this movie, they aren't.

HOWEVER, because of my relationship to the appallingly medieval state of mental health treatment in my country and other ""advanced"" societies, the shrink is the psycho-killer responsible for all the stuff and things in this movie, and that makes me giggle a bit.  Plus, his head explodes at the end.",1471219200,,2393,4.613207547169812

6601398,5,B00MU1YEJK,"Another hidden gem of a movie. I really enjoyed it. I love when a movie turns out to be so much better than I thought it would. I caught this one on Netflix. It has just the right amount of suspense, mystery and comedy. I loved the twist in the storyline. The ending was great. I've watched it twice already, once alone and once with my nephew who loved it as well. Definitely recommend it!",1469059200,,390,4.213333333333333
6601399,5,B00MU1YEJK,"Horror comedy is very hard to do, imho. This one gets it right. Massively entertaining; funny, and some good frights. Nothing gory, nothing too out there for the squeamish or the kids. Really fun. I've watched it a few times and it holds up.",1468540800,,241,4.5

6601405,5,B00MU1YEJK,"you would think this movie was written and directed by simon pegg himself but its not and this movie is soon good the only way it could get any better is if simon pegg or nick frost starred in it! if you are a true fan of ""Shaun Of The Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", ""Paul"", ""The Worlds End"" or Even ""Kill Me Three Times"" then this movie is for you! it's not for everybody but Morgana O'riley performs so good you would think she was the female simon pegg, she has such a funny sense of humor, so does her mother and her probation officer in the movie might as well just be ""nick frost"" because he's just as funny! this movie is not ""gory horror"", it does have scenes that will make you jump, other scenes that should, like one involving a teddy bear but it just made me laugh at the same time because this is a true horror/comedy...a true gem, wether there is a sequel in the future or not, this will forever be a masterpiece in my collection & it's also VERY RARE for Blu-Ray Region 1 Users, so if you can find it for $20 or cheaper, i suggest you grab it because its so good its considered gold and already a collectible, thank god amazon made an exclusive blurry release for US & Canada",1465516800,,1178,4.148471615720524

6601407,4,B00MU1YEJK,"I hated the first half of this movie really hated the main character. Once this movie gets going it is fun and funny with a few decent jump scares and a pretty gory finale. It is so campy, though, that the gore at the end was actually one of the biggest laughs of the film.",1461024000,,273,3.981818181818182
6601408,5,B00MU1YEJK,"What a surprisingly good movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I trusted the reviews. What I got out of it was a very well-written, well-crafted story, with good acting, that took a horror premise and made it into quite the intriguing mystery. There is more that I want to say, but don't want to spoil the plot or direction, but I will say that this touched on various genres throughout, cleverly so, and it had its fair share of twists, which truly were twists, not just cheap shocks. Overall, a fun movie, with some clever non-forced humor sprinkled here and there, that should have been a theatric release in the United States. (Although the story has nothing to do with the plot, the feel of it was akin to the mid-1980s film ""House 2"" with less the comedy, and more of the intrigue.)",1459036800,,791,4.462068965517242

This movie is quite long (almost two hours) , but the story plot and like I mentioned , the acting is so great, you get lost in the movie. When it wad actually over, I still wanted more.

All I will say is that I am sorry the people who rated it anything less than 4 stars didn't enjoy it.  They probably ate the wrong brand of caviar when they watched it.

6601521,4,B00MU1YEJK,"First things first.  This has a cover/poster that makes it look like a home invader movie like The Strangers (2008), some descriptions and reviews that suggest it is a haunted house movie, and it is marketed as a horror comedy.  More accurate than anything is that this New Zealand horror flick is a comedy.  It smacks of Dead Alive (1992) if you were to turn the gore down from an 11 to a 2 and the utterly zany insanity is much lower as well.

While advertised as a horror comedy, the first half of this movie will not make that obvious.  I found a lot of things funny, but they didn't seem deliberate in the sense of filming a comedy.  It just seemed to be the interesting nature of the characters.  However, as the story advanced, so did the obvious intent of the humor therein.  And as for the horror, you may jump but this movie is not scary and only playfully creepy.

The pissy antihero of the story is recently convicted Kylie (Morgana O'Reilly), who is placed under house arrest with her mother and stepfather after she gets caught doing a smash-and-grab job.  More like an angry, petulant teenager than a woman in her 20s, Kylie resists her mothers every attempt to be pleasant, civil, constructive, or generally happy.  It seems that Kylie is doing everything she can to make her parents lives as miserable as hers.  Its funny to watch this unfold and well-acted, but its a little frustrating as well.  We really don't find ourselves rooting for Kylie at this point.

Kylies mother (Rima Te Wiata), however, is absolutely delightful.  Shes overly pleasant, loves small talk-loving, a bit nave, and she believes that her house is haunted.  All of these things annoy the grumpy Kylie, who is especially antagonistic to her mothers belief in their ghostly houseguests.  Kylie experiences an encounter in the basement when investigating a rogue ringing cell phone and insists there is a home invader.  Kylies mother has other ideas of the nature of this intruder and shes really cute about her opinion on the matter.

There to back Kylies mother up is Amos (Glen-Paul Waru), a security guard who monitors Kylies house arrest and responds to their call about the recent disturbance.  When he finds no sign of a break-in or intruder, he suggests the presence of an other-worldly form.  Like Kylies mother, Amos brings us more comic relief but in a more straight-faced role as an amateur paranormal investigator.  He sets up the house with cameras a la Paranormal Activity but don't worry, the movie does not follow that over-used playbook at all.  It takes its own path devoid of found footage, shaky cameras and video analysis.

From here things take a few interesting turns leaving us wondering about the nature of Kylies encounter in the basement and several other weird sounds in the house.  We learn about the disturbing history of the house and murders that took place there when it served as a halfway house for mentally unstable youths.  We meet an extremely creepy neighbor.  Kylie meets with a therapist who suggests that her overly active mind in her inactive house arrest setting may be playing tricks on her.  And with all this piled up on us, people start dying and Kylie becomes a believer in the paranormal.  I should warn, however, that one major plot turn rather reduced my interest significantly.  It did remain funny, thougheven funnier, in fact.

Writer/director Gerard Johnstone does a fine job with his first feature length film and I am eager to see what he does next.  After all, perhaps the things I didn't like about the third act were more a product of taste than quality.

The characters are interesting, fun and quirkyand perfectly acted for this film.  The story doesnt go anywhere we expect.  And I laughed a lot among a few unexpected jumps.  Part of me wants to call this a gem but I just wasn't pleased with where the story went in the third act.  It got weird in an unexciting way for me (and my company watching it), even though it was a sort of original story element and the humor certainly accelerated for the better.

Id say you should see this if you enjoy off-color horror comedy.  This was just a semi-precious stone for me, but for you it may be just the hidden gem youve been wanting.",1426118400,,4236,4.672972972972973

The daughter has no respect at all for the mother, who seems to have some sort of mental disability or just hasn't got out much as she isn't too wise to the ways of the world. The daughter is rude to everyone else as well, and has even less respect for her mother when she hears her on the radio calling into a talkback station saying some expert who was on the air who is dismissing ghosts is lying, because she's encountered things in her house over the past 20 or so years she has lived there.  It is only when the daughter is awakened one night by her broken mobile phone ringing from the basement and knowing that her mother and her mother's husband are too stupid to have fixed it that she starts to believe there may be some validity to her mother's claims. Other weird stuff also is occurring. Of course she can't leave the house, so she's going to be alone with it if it is real at times.  If it does exist, what does it want?

6601532,5,B00MU1YEJK,"Housebound is a horror comedy treat that deserves its growing cult status. Its overall effect depends on not knowing the story's twist going in, so I'll avoid spoiling it. The setup is this: Kylie gets busted for breaking into an ATM and sentenced to 8 months of house arrest at her mother Miriam's decrepit old place in the country. She has barely settled in before strange things start happening in the house. Miriam admits that she has long thought the house to be haunted. She and Kylie manage to rope Amos, the guy in charge of monitoring Kylie's ankle bracelet, into helping them investigate the occurrences. They uncover a shocking event in the house's history. And then things really go pear-shaped. This is set in New Zealand, but you won't have any trouble understanding anyone's accents. There's actually more comedy than horror in this movie's DNA, but there are a few creepy scenes and the gorehounds will get their moments as well. This movie has a sublime sense of the ridiculous. There's also a refreshing change of pace in the presentation of the heroine, a young woman who is not what anyone would call a nice girl, but who remains sympathetic in spite of that. She exhibits a complexity and a proactive attitude you don't often see in horror heroines. An example (without spoiling the story) is when the haunt is teasing her with a creaky closet door. She takes the door off its hinges and then goes back to what she was doing. If you like horror comedy this is well worth the ticket price.",1424822400,7,1509,4.676691729323308
6601533,4,B00MU1YEJK,"Fans of Horror/Comedy typically wade through a pile of unfunny, un-scary, ""Scary Movie"" type films to find anything that effectively combines both genres. Housebound is one of those that does it well with a dry, darkly funny wit. Filming in New Zealand gives it a bit of a different feel as well. The entire cast is excellent with a great sense of timing (Claire van der Boom who plays Kylie also stars in ""The Square"" an Aussie thriller worth watching). Admittedly, it does start a bit slow, but stick with it, it definitely picks up and finishes well.",1424822400,,553,4.653061224489796
6601534,5,B00MU1YEJK,"I have been reading about this film for some time now and was finally able to see it last night.  I also managed to convince my wife to watch it too.  She absolutely hates horror movies so it wasn't easy convincing her that this might be something a little different.  I talked about all of the reviews from fans and critics praising the movie's unique approach and was able to persuade her to at least give it a try.  The very first scene helps to establish that this indeed something a little different.  The principal character and her partner in crime try to bust open an ATM machine and the results are hilarious.  It reminded me of some of those in store security cameras that catch stupid criminals.  As I am sure you've heard, yep...there is comedy in this horror film.  I think the success of the movie lies in the way it delivers the comedy.  It is totally believable and not unrealistic potty humor garbage.  Most of the characters in this movie...you've probably met before.  Their reactions to what is going on around them are classic and their facial expressions are all that is needed to get a good laugh at times.

The story centers around a young girl who is on house arrest because of her delinquent behavior.  While she is there, strange things begin to happen and she begins to think that her mother's opinion that the house is haunted might be true.  This ghost story becomes quite interesting as events unfold.  It's kind of like a mystery story as well...compelling you to watch until the end.  Bits of silliness will have you laughing while moments of horror will have you jumping.  Not many movies can accomplish that and at the same time give you a great story too.  The actors playing the roles are extraordinary.  There believability under these imaginary circumstances is what makes this movie gold.  The actress who plays the mother does such a great job and I'm telling you...you've met this lady before!  Even characters like the security guy and minor characters like the cops do a wonderful job with their roles.

If your looking for a great movie that will give you the laughs and the chills...you've got to check this one out.  As I said, my wife hates horror films but ending up loving this one.  It has some gross moments, scary jumps, but it's glazed over nicely with comic relief that isn't cheap vulgar trash.  It's quite entertaining and movies like this are a rare treat because they don't come around often.",1424822400,3,2451,4.618055555555555

6601538,4,B00MU1YEJK,"I've learned something over the years -- New Zealanders seem to find it difficult to make a straightforward horror movie.  They have this quirky sensibility that just seeps into their horror movies.

And we can add ""Housebound"" to the pile of very funny, quirky horror movies that came from New Zealand, and definitely one of the better examples. This very low budget film would be a somewhat passable haunted-house/murder mystery if it weren't so quirky, but it definitely wouldn't be as memorable or delightfully weird. Case in point: there is a demonic Teddy Ruxpin that seems to be stalking the heroine.

After a failtastic ATM robbery gone wrong, Kylie (Morgana O'Reilly) is sentenced to eight months of house arrest in her old family home, with her chatterbox mother Miriam (Rima Te Wiata) and quiet stepmother Graeme (Ross Harper). Kylie does little except eat and lie around watching daytime TV, much to her mother's dismay -- and after Miriam calls in to a radio show, declaring that there is a bedsheeted ghost in her house, Kylie heaps even more disdain on her.

Then she wanders down into the basement at night... and a hand grabs her ankle. Security guard/anklet monitor Amos (Glen-Paul Waru) believes the declaration that there is a ghost in the house, and insists that Kylie should help it find peace.

Investigating some old stuff in the basement, Kylie soon finds out that her childhood home is actually a former halfway house -- and there was a gruesome murder shortly before her mother bought the place. After finding some crucial evidence, she unsurprisingly thinks it was the creepy redneck neighbor -- but soon discovers that the truth about both the ghost and the murder is far stranger than she could have imagined. And it might get both her and Miriam killed.

Consider ""Housebound"" tio be an example of how low budgets don't equal poor quality -- this movie was made on a mere quarter of a million US dollars, and has no huge stars in it. It excels because it's just really, really well made, from the drifting camerawork to the spooky, perpetually shadowy interior lighting, fizzy electronica and some really jarring scenes like a sheeted figure looming over one of the cops while the lights flicker on and off.

Writer/director Gerard Johnstone also seems to be drawing inspiration from some classic movies like ""The Changeling"" and ""The Shining,"" in a way that still feels fresh rather than derivative. But he brings something extra to the table -- that wickedly quirky New Zealand sense of humor. While still harrowing and spooky, he brings humor to the movie from the very first scene (the ATM robbery is crammed with fail). So we get everything from the subtle (Kylie trying to pry her sleeping neighbor's dental plate out) to the gloriously weird (a killer chases Kylie and Miriam with a giant knife... while stuck inside a laundry hamper).

If there's a flaw, it's the slightly disorienting shift that takes place towards the climax, when the whole ghost concept is dropped like a stone in favor of a more earthly explanation for everything that's going on. I actually found this incredibly confusing when I first saw the movie, and had to see it another time before I fully comprehended it.

It takes a while to warm up to O'Reilly's Kylie, which is clearly the intention -- Kylie is a bratty, self-absorbed woman who doesn't seem to have gotten past her teen rebellion phase, and who blames her mother for... existing. Her transition into a decent human being isn't explicitly explored (there's no psychobabble moment that changes everything), but she gradually changes into a scrappy, strong-willed heroine who actually cares about other people.

There aren't a lot of supporting actors, but they are all excellent -- Wiata as Kylie's sweet, chatterboxy mother and who just wants to live a pleasant life; Harper as her pleasant rarely-speaking husband; and a delightful turn by Waru as Kylie's monitor/partner-in-investigation, who steadfastly believes in ghosts and occasionally smacks some sense into our anti-heroine. He's a delight, and we should see him in more movies.

And... Eugene. Ryan Lampp's Eugene. It's impossible to describe Eugene without giving away the entire twist of the movie, except to say that he looks like a perpetually-surprised goth squirrel-man. He is one of the greatest characters in the world, and it's a shame we don't see more of him.

Clever, smart and spooky, ""Housebound"" manages to take a lot of cliches and make them feel fresh as new. A must-see for those who like some laughs with their blood and spookery... and possibly a three-quarter-size Jesus statue.",1424649600,,4633,4.9638709677419355

6601614,3,B00MU1YEJK,"One of the least successful genre mash-ups is the Horror/ Comedy. Ivan Reitman's timeless ""Ghostbusters"" and Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" from 1984, Tim Burton's ""Beetlejuice"" from 1988 and Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" from 1992 are some of the greatest examples of pulling off this juggling act. In these films we have four examples of finding that delicate tone of equal humor and terror. ""Housebound"", though not even half as successful as these previously mentioned works, finds this note and balances delicately on this appropriate atmosphere and a suitable pace for all of its 111 minutes with better than average results.

  What keeps this tale of a woman detained to the haunted estate in which she grew up in from being a knock-out is that it relies too heavily on ghost cliches and far too many ""bump in the night"" moments which seem ripe for parody but the script never takes advantage of that. Despite this it has a few strangely off the wall instances (such as a talking, possessed teddy bear) which capture the right feeling of uncouth humor and outlandishness necessary for the genre blend it is attempting. The shifts to more serious scares (which takes up most of the second half) is effortless and adds key instances of witty humor sparingly ( the type that is more amusing than laugh out loud hilarious which is the way to do these types of features) and just enough to give the motion picture a bit of extra dimension and charm without taking away from the fearful atmosphere it builds well but in a semi-conventional manner.

  The cast, lead by a pitch-perfect performance by Morgana O' Reilly, as Kylie Buckley, is one of the prime reasons the opposite tones of Horror and Comedy come together so well. All of the performers ( especially Rima Te Wiata as the lead's fast-talking mother, Miriam Buckley) are smart and capable enough to be stone faced and somber and goofy when required. Often this is in the same scene which makes this juggling act all the more admirable.

  It's never scary, a sad sacrifice when putting Horror and Comedy together, nor ever side-splittingly humorous but its satisfying. Writer-Director Gerard Johnstone knows how to set gothic atmosphere with bravado and build jokes so that they never feel forced. It may not be a masterpiece like ""Ghostbusters "", "" Gremlins "", ""Beetlejuice "" or ""Dead Alive"" but it stands far above the many that have faltered at said genre mixture before. It's entertaining throughout and should bring a reminiscent smile to fans of both genres and that is more than enough to recommend this quirky bit of cinema.",1420156800,,2586,4.859090909090909

It's not the funniest movie but overall it is very amusing. The lead actress and her mother's almost blas&eacute; approach to the majority of the things happening around them add more to the dark comedic undertones.

6601655,5,B00MU1YEJK,"This was an amazing movie, I absolutely loved it. Throughout Housebound, it shifts from being really scary, to creepy, to hilariously funny, sometimes all at once. The main set up is genius, and nothing I've ever really seen. The main character is under house arrest with her mom after a failed ATM robbery, the only problem is that the house is haunted. There are so many different facets of this movie, but to talk about them too much could spoil them, needless to say all of the characters are unique and entertaining. The movie definitely has a different feel to it in comparison to American movies, especially American Horror movies, but I really didn't mind the various Australianisms. I'd highly recommend this movie, but some people probably won't like this, it's really weird, and might be too humorous for horror fans, and too scary for comedy fans, but I loved it.",1419033600,2,875,4.801324503311259

6601671,3,B00MU1YEJK,"Housebound is a letdown for me. I did not find it scary, which may be considered typical for a horror comedy, but I also did not find it funny either. Humor is subjective, but I have seen enough horror comedies to appreciate the sub-genre and know what makes it good/bad. From what I understand, most of those who loved the comedy in this effort hate horror comedies in general, so if you are that person then maybe this is for you. If not, then don't believe the hype. If anything, watch this with an open mind and tell me if you agree or if I am just out of touch here.",1418515200,,571,4.153153153153153

6601673,5,B00MU1YEJK,"Housebound is a very well crafted movie, mostly because it perfectly balances suspense/horror with comedic tones that laugh in the face of classic horror moments. But even with all those great comedy bits, there are quite a few creepy moments in the movie that gets your heart pounding. The story on the other hand is quite original (especially once all the cards are thrown on the table), I won't give too much away, but it plays out like a ghost story with the main character trapped inside the house, and then turns into something much different. Housebound is full of surprises and comical elements that keeps the somewhat darker story light at heart. Having the main character on house arrest is a nice touch that forces her to stay inside the house, versus having her flee at the first sign of something sinister happening inside the house walls. Housebound plays out with some typical horror elements, but the main character refuses to follow suit and every time something 'unusual' happens, she tackles those situations more level headed than most horror movie characters, which creates some great humor. As I said above, I loved how the movie easily transitioned between being quite comical to some very solid scares, it also has a very strong creep factor as well! I was not expecting a whole lot going into this movie so it turned out to be quite a surprise, even though the movie certainly would have been better had it trimmed it's runtime down! And as for a warning, if you for some odd reason you struggle through the first 1/2 of the movie (I'm not sure why you would though), just know that the 3rd act is where all the excitement and mayhem lives! This movie is along the likes of Tucker & Dale vs Evil, and although it is definitely a darker movie than that, Housebound features a lot more (and welcomed) surprises!",1418256000,3,1834,4.681114551083591
6601674,3,B00MU1YEJK,"Another version of Crawlspace. Interesting characters, decent plot, a few laughs, but it fails to pay off if you were expecting a real ghost/monster story.

Second, there were no cheesy CGI tricks or cliched horror moments (such as the ever-present ""stretchy long-mouth"" scream)... it was all done in a pretty unique way.

Gerard Johnstone direction is great too for his first film and cannot wait for what this director brings in the future. The humor is very dark and I enjoyed it it's not your usual horror comedy were you are pushed with jokes. The humor just comes with certain scenes and the way the characters are portrayed.

Housebound's ostensible ghost story about something preternatural living in the walls is a horror trope commonly explored, from the deranged roommate in Scottish film Shallow Grave to the incest survivor in the 4th season episode, ""Family Remains,"" of the American television series, Supernatural. Writer/director Gerard Johnstone relies on this convention being present in the audience's expectations to add a layer of meaning to the thing-in-the-walls cliche: what if what's in there represents real-world things we can't see but miss or want back, like absent parents, runaway teens, skiptrace tenants or a wasted life?

But lest we get too bogged down in serious meaning, Johnstone yanks us back to the shallow now with some very funny organic humor in a hearty thriller whose multiple twists keep coming, carried along by refreshingly non-pretty acting and adrenalin-inducing drection. Even the score is excellent-- hair-raising while remaining unobtrusive. In fact, not a single thing in the film tells us how to feel about the story and its players; every character is revealed, warts and all, just as our protagonist, Kylie, a recalcitrent thief sentenced to house arrest at her childhood home, experiences them, cementing us inside the heroines point of view. Its rare for a horror film not to architect suspense by clueing the audience into a danger that lies ahead for the lead; we never know more than Kylie does, and what we do know, we find out when she does.

Also refreshing is Kylie's character, written as intelligent, capable and prickly in the most human of ways, which anchors this film in a reality that is familiar and easy to identify with, which makes what happens all the more scary. Kiwi actress Morgana O'Reilly's deft physicality lends a real heft to her portrayal of Kylie, as does the physical humor of her hapless mother's mercurial facial expressions, played with a dimwitted energy by veteran Australian television actress, Rima Te Wiata. I wasn't going to mention how relieved I was to have not one, but TWO real women in the leads, not some modelesque will owisp Forever 21er trying to act past dead eyes and their botoxed, surgically enhanced older counterparts. But I am mentioning it because other reviewers refer to them as dumpy and average looking, which is a disgrace to women and humanity everywhere.

A definate must-see for horror mavens and tongue-in-cheekers everywhere, Housebound is great fun with that characteristic New Zealand warp; at one point, Kylie goes after the evil menace with a knife wielded like a sword in one hand and a cheese grater over the other arm like a shield! Domestic violence indeed.",1416182400,,3050,5.083832335329341

6601780,5,B00MU1YEJK,"This was quite a delightful surprise in many respects. The star of the film is a feisty gal with real attitude issues, however, her fledgling acting skills are good enough to allow her to maintain a difficult balancing act between being just downright repugnantly obnoxious and also interjecting real humor while staying in character. Her character comes off as being very human, believable and genuine.

The mother is brilliant as the hysterically clueless dimwit.

There are a number of important surprises here so you have to pay attention and the ending is very amusing for a change instead of falling back on the typical cliche creepy doom and gloom dude watching you from the upstairs bedroom window as you drive away into the closing credits.",1415750400,,749,4.984
6601781,5,B00MU1YEJK,"Housebound is a delightful offbeat crime, murder, horror, thriller comedy.

Its tone is set in the opening action when two masked thieves try to rob an ATM. We quickly see the flaws in their plan.

A sledgehammer rebounding off an ATM should not be stopped by the wielder's forehead.

A VW is poor getaway car once it jumps half way over a left turn island.

An incorrigible flaky female felon, Kylie, is sentenced to house arrest.

When Kylie hears her mother on a psychic hotline describing strange sounds in her walls and seeing some sort of sheet clad spirit in her laundry room, we have good hope that weirdness might ensue.

It does.

This movie delivers horror-lite: A possessed teddy bear threatens Kylie...someone is attacked by one of those plastic coated wire frame things ladies use for drying underwear....a villain wielding a skill saw and wearing safety goggles runs about menacingly...

Added to this mix is a chubby security tech who fit Kylie's anklet who turns out to be a ghost hunter want to be who assists Kylie's efforts in Scooby Doo type investigation..

Of the mysterious sounds and ghostly apparition, none dare speak its name...just look at the DVD cover....

6601792,4,B00MU1YEJK,"Housebound is a movie that practically sits up and begs for repeat viewings, a near-perfect cocktail of comedy of manners and murder mystery masquerading as a supernatural thriller.  In fact, its so deceptively smart and its humor so quirky that its not hard to imagine audiences overlooking its charms the first time around, I did.  But on closer inspection, I found that it only grew on me with each successive viewing (Ive watched it three times now).  The reason is the plot is so densely packed that its easy to get lost in the maze of twists and red herrings, making it either richly entertaining or occasionally frustrating, all depending on your point of view.  Beginning with a rather funny botched robbery (the madcap tone can be another hurdle for horror fans), Kylie (Morgana OReilly) is placed under house arrest and remanded to her mothers care.  Returning to your childhood home can be a horror all its own, but its played mostly for laughs here, and rightfully so.  There are hints about fractures in the family scattered around the edges of the story, but they're light and subtle and never inhibit the fun, and theres much of that to be had.  Among the films biggest delights is Rima Te Wiatas hammy performance as Kylies mom, Miriam, a well-intentioned bigmouth who rarely misses an opportunity to shower her daughter in embarrassment.  Compounding problems in their already combative relationship is Miriams insistence that the house is haunted.  Initially dubious, if not outright hostile to the suggestion, Kylie only reluctantly starts to come around when odd happenings pile up around her.  And so with the help of her eccentric ghost-hunting PO, Amos (an equally fun Glen Paul-Waru), she begins to investigate the house and its history.  From here, writer/director Gerard Johnstone sets about sending us down any number of rabbit holes, exploring one false lead after another, all of which amazingly tie together in a neat little package by the end of the movie.  The problem is, with so many balls in the air, the plot becomes unwieldy at times, unable to sustain a tone as it wavers between horror and comedy.  Its been my experience that a scary movie can have funny moments, but cant be outright comedic, a boundary that Housebound pushes up against and seems to have no qualms with crossing over.  So when the suspense is eventually ratcheted up, its already been undermined by all thats come before it.  Given this, its a small miracle that the film works as well as it does.  With roughly half the jokes falling flat and the suspense at best muted, the movie only has its makers giddy enthusiasm to feed on, and thankfully, its contagious.  I suspect this is why it holds up so well and may one day rank as a genre classic, because even the scariest movies (think The Exorcist, Chainsaw Massacre, etc.) are eventually blunted by familiarity.  They don't so much scare us as remind us of a time when we were scared.  Revisiting this movie I expect to be an altogether different experience, because its strength lies in its vitality, and thats a much more stubborn trait to dull.  So if Dead Alive (another New Zealand export) is the precedent, and its the only movie I can think of thats even remotely similar, then expect many happy viewings in the future.  Still, I have a nagging suspicion that my initial, rather more subdued reaction may one day win out, preventing me from giving a more full-throated endorsement.  Regardless, whether this movie breaks conventions or fits snugly within them, expect a good time and that is (if nothing else) two hours of your life well spent.",1415318400,,3613,4.821717990275527

6601813,5,B00MU1YEJK,"Housebound is a perfect horror/thriller/comedy. Nothing in the movie is an original idea, however, this movie is done so cleverly that all the elements of a good horror/scary movie are here: creepy neighbor, haunted house, a murder mystery, among other plot ideas, but they are so cleverly wrapped up in this movie that it is a real treat for anyone who likes a good haunted house mystery.

The acting is wonderful: Kirlie-a young troubled woman is sent home to live with her mother and her step father in the old house she was raised in. She has to wear an ankle bracelet and can't go beyond the home's boundaries. Her Mother: She has secrets and believes her house is haunted. She is less than thrilled that her selfish daughter has come home and has to stay for 8 long months.  The creepy neighbor: Possum skinner, pack rat, spooky old man, may hold the key to the mystery of murder in Kirlie's house. There are other characters that just add to the amusement of this movie.

If you are tired of the old slasher films, or films that have been rehashed to death, you should give this one a try. It's very well acted and cleverly executed.

8674559,3,B00MU1YEJK,"Young hoodlum Kylie (Morgana O'Reilly) gets caught by the police yet again, this time robbing an ATM. Since she's been through various rehabilitation programs, the court decides to try a different approach and sentences her to eight months house arrest at her mother's home, with visits from her probation officer and a therapist. The sentence should be easy time but Kylie is estranged from her mother. Mom still lives in the house where Kylie grew up. He mom has married a new and strange man since her husband left her for better times. The family dynamic is dysfunctional and awkward. If that wasn't bad enough, Mom thinks the house is haunted, which Kylie initially scoffs at. Then things start going bump in the night, especially in the dark and creepy basement.

What could be played as a straight-faced horror movie is played as a comedy. The movie runs through a lot of standard cliches (the creepy basement, weird and unnerving toys, false suspects, etc.) but the New Zealand setting and cast give it some freshness. Kylie is initially unlikeable but grows on the viewer as the situation gets more complicated and harrowing. After an hour and a half of comedy and jump scares, the ending is surprisingly gory which is also played for comedic effect.

Horror-comedy is hard to pull off. This is not a great example but a good one. It had more depth than I was expecting and more twists too. The gore at the end was a bit much and felt out of place, but it was a rather minor flaw overall.

It's available on DVD and also streaming through Netflix (at least as I post this in February 2018).",1518220800,,1599,4.6431095406360425
