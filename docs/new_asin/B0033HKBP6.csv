4065442,5,B0033HKBP6,"Yes, yes. This isn't an ""official"" 'Slumber Party' or 'Sorority House' sequel. It is in fact, an homage - or parody.

And while the production values are low; it, in fact - is better than ""Cheerleader Massacre"" and is definitely worth a look/purchase for fans of both series.

The kill scenes are basically segregated to the final 25 minutes; and there's two in the first 45. You've got to love the short running time (keeping up with the other movies). And the best part is; not only is this filled with bad dialogue, vapid characters; low production values and cheesy one-liners - it also contains extended cameos from Reggie Bannister (who is almost a star here) and Linnea Quigley. A must see for 80's aficionados.

Also recommended for order is the re-release of the ""Slumber Party Massacre"" from Shout Factory. The set contains all 3 films - in 16x9 wide screen; and a slew of extras.

And for those who are interested; here's my rankings of the ""Slumber Party""/""Sorority House"" Massacre series - best to worst with star rankings out of five (knock-off's and spin-offs included):

""Slumber Party Massacre"" (1982) - ***** The Original and Best - Brinke is HOT here in her cameo. A classic 80's slasher to go down in history.
""Sorority House Massacre"" (1986) - ****1/2 Starts off slow - and then has an amazing finale. A great spin-off.
""Spring Break Massacre"" (2008) - ****1/2 - Cheap for sure. But a welcome movie that was a BIG step-up from ""Cheerleader Massacre"". Linnea Quigley and Reggie Bannister are WELCOME anytime.
""Hard to Die"" (1990) - **** - The unofficial ""Sorority House Massacre 3"" - but it contains stock footage from ""Slumber Party Massacre""? This one is so-bad-it's-good - and knew it. I LOVE this lousy clone of ""Die Hard"". Great fun. Forrest J. Ackerman has an amazing cameo.
""Slumber Party Massacre 3"" (1990) - **** - Great fun. LOVED the next-door-neighbor with the telescope. Hope the re-release DVD is Unrated - because the New Concorde DVD I own is EDITED!!!! Still holding on to my VHS.
""Sorority House Massacre 2"" (1990) - ***1/2 - CHEAP - but great fun. So-Bad-It's-Good in many ways. Boom mics and blood bottles throughout. Worth a purchase at a reasonable price for sure.
""Slumber Party Massacre 2"" (1987) - *** - Kinda a rip off of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" that doesn't make sense. Though Points for the killer with the drill in his guitar.
""The Last Slumber Party"" (1988) - A knock-off that's so-bad-it's-good. Terrible film stock. Atrocious gore effects - but laugh out loud funny :-)
""Cheerleader Massacre"" (2003) - **1/2 - LAME movie. Bad Video. Worth a rent or purchase (if cheap). Glad it wasn't an official sequel.

4065443,4,B0033HKBP6,"""This movie feels so retro that it should be sold on both VHS and DVD in my opinion and any fan of the era will come away from ""Spring Break Massacre"" more than pleased with their viewing experience...All the 80's clichs are here and often done in a very humorous way...A must see film for any old school horror fans looking for a fix of pure popcorn fun you'll feel like your back at the drive-in minutes into this film.""

""Simply put, this movie is absolutely everything you want it to be. Attempting to explain the plot or pick apart the nuances would be a waste of my time and yours because we both know what it's about and what happens. What you don't know is whether or not it's awesome. Well guess what? It totally is.""

4065444,4,B0033HKBP6,"""Spring Break Massacre"" is an obvious homage to stuff like the ""Slumber Party"" and ""Sorority House"" massacre movies.

Is it great? No. Is it good? No. It's cheap - but unapologetic.

The entire cast of females appear topless (together in 3 scenes); and 80's horror icons Reggie Bannister shares many of his scenes with scream queen Linnea Quigley (as his deputy).

The plot is inconsequential here - but, I guess, serves it's purpose. I wish it had been gorier; but the little blood there is seems OK. There are some hilarious moments making fun of the cliched characters (one is an obvious lesbian the group seems to look past) like the neighbor from Sorority House Massacre 2.

It's loaded with intentional bad dialogue and mediocre acting - so, if that's your thing - you'll have a blast. If you don't dig 80's flicks, or the ""Massacre"" movies - steer clear. Most everything here is an in-joke to those movies (though there is a big laugh when the guys and girls attempt to scare eachother - all wearing masks).

Technically the movie is hit and miss; but better than micro-budget cinema. The DVD was bare bones - but did have a sparse making-of explaining most of it was shot in 6 days(!?). So, in the great tradition of Roger Corman, here comes this movie.

I will say - it was better than ""Cheerleader Massacre"" and some of the girls here are awfully attractive.

3.5 out of 5

Worth a look, but is one to watch with beer and friends who are ready to laugh.

Now - if somebody would make one of these things on a bigger lever. Please. ""Sorority Row"" just wasn't that fun!",1272758400,16,1577,4.524647887323944
4065445,1,B0033HKBP6,"I was looking forward to this movie being released since I love the other massacre series movies a lot- especially Slumber Party Massacre.  This movie moves at a slow pace to the point where you could fast forward 40 min into the movie and not really miss any action at all except for one killing near the beginning.  The movie lacks any type of suspense. Half of the killings happen without the killer ever even being seen at all.  The direction and acting were very poorly done.  This movie could have been a lot of fun but the majority of the movie is a bunch of people just sitting around talking with no action.  The sound quality goes in and out all the time.  I am huge fan of B rated horror movies and have seen my share of really good ones and really bad ones.  This one happens to be one of the bad ones. If you are curious, check it out but don't expect much at all. 1.5/5",1272758400,6,883,4.158823529411765
4065446,4,B0033HKBP6,"For anyone who spent some of their better nights watching the Slumber Party Massacre movies, this will be of great enjoyment. Coming in at only 74 minutes, this movie packs everything necessary in and with it keeps a nice pace. With many references to the old Slumber Party movies (and even the Sorority House Massacre movies) this movie is great for all the fans of the series. The characters are great, the expendable ones die fast and the main characters are given enough development that you care but not enough that it drags the story along. The plot is simplistic (as it is in all these movies) but perfectly executed and everything that fans of these movies want (gratuitous nudity, terribly great dialogue, and blood spilling) will definitely be satisfied with this film. I waited for over a year (if not more) for this to come out so my expectations were obviously quite high and I was not disappointed.",1272240000,27,912,4.7421383647798745

8387993,1,B0033HKBP6,"I really don't know where to start with this movie, but it was a bitter disappointment. I want to set the record straight, I love B movies, horror movies, movies that are ""so bad they are good"" and good old low budget schlock.  Now with a name like ""Spring Break Massacre"" I was expecting a great time.  Sadly, this movie fell flat and hard.  This is coming from a guy who has watched all the ""Slumber Party Massacre"" films and ""Sorority House Massacre"" films and myriad films that include barely clad women who are being ""hacked up"".

The major problem with this movie is it is slow, slow and slow.  Did I mention that it was slow? The film is about an hour and sixteen minutes, so it is short in length but the pace is hideous. Not to mention that all the characters are annoying and not in a funny ""I can't wait to see who dies first"" sort of way.  It was cool to see Reggie Bannister (The Phantasm series) and Linnea Quigley (1980s and early 1990s scream queen) as the sheriff and deputy respectfully.  Yet even their performances were not enough to save this film.  Actually, Quigley looks tired and beat down in her performance.

I have heard that this film is homage to those old slasher films of the 80s and I disagree.  This looked like it was made on a three hundred dollar budget and made in four days.  Again, this is not a complement to ""so bad it is good"" cinema.  And if that doesn't sell it for you, the girls in this movie really don't get nude all that much.  Not that nudity is needed for a horror movie to be good, but when everything else sucks nudity could be a saving grace, in this film, not so much.  At the end of the day I had spring breaks in elementary school that were more exciting than this movie.",1334793600,4,1729,4.263803680981595
8387994,1,B0033HKBP6,"Some reviewers go on about what a great laugh this is.
Sorry, but if you want a laugh watch Seinfeld or something.
Horror should be horror, and this feeble excuse for a horror film doesn't cut the mustard.
It's absolute rubbish of the first order. Bad acting, bad direction, cr@p story.............and if you are watching it to see a famous old horror starlet don't bother. She acts like a wardrobe in this and looks about 150 years old.
AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE",1315180800,2,459,4.609756097560975
8387995,3,B0033HKBP6,"This movie started off pretty bad, looking like a homemade porn. It changed and started looking pretty good. The story line was pretty good. The characters got killed off too quickly and there wasn't enough gore. If you are thinking this would be like the Slumber party massacres or even the Sorority House Massacres, you will be very disappointed but all in all it was a pretty decent movie in its own right.",1298419200,3,409,4.616438356164384

The girls are nice to look at the acting is good enough. I like the idea of who the killer was and his motive. I did not see it coming, as well as the role of the creepy neighbor.

8387998,3,B0033HKBP6,"I wasn't expecting too much from this movie.  It is a bit better than I expected.  There are only a couple of ""that doesn't make any sense"" moments, even when you prepare yourself for a lower budget slasher movie.  The dialog is a bit contrived in places, but you can tell the actors and director put effort and heart into this movie.  This movie is at least as good as any other movie on late-night cable TV.  I would give this movie a 3.5 star rating, if possible.",1279497600,5,466,4.25
