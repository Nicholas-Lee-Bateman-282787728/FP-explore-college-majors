3978309,5,B002S5PSBG,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  Although Eoin mentions that this DVD would be good at any level, I think that if someone was really new to exercise in general, this may not be a good fit.  There is a person doing a modified version for many of the poses, but it's not always easy to see what she is doing, and they don't always discuss the modifiers so it's a matter of watching, or already knowing what possible modifications to make.

Easy Street (51 minutes):  I take one day a week off from the elliptical and strength exercise but usually try to get in some walking.  On this particular day off, I opted to try this yoga flow instead of walking, looking for something gentle to provide some stretching.  I was feeling a bit tight when I first started but felt wonderful after.  This practice starts in a sitting meditation, thinking about your breath and alignment, before moving into some gentle cat / cow and downward dog stretches. It then goes into sun salutation with 2 rounds for each leg and a nice standing stretching flow that begins from warrior 2. Pigeon pose with forward bend is next, and he gives very good instructions on form and alignment.  Next is a stretch series that is about 11 minutes long and includes several different seated forward bends, upward (reverse) plank, revolved head to knee and a ballet arch pose. Stretching continues with half spinal twist and gomukhasana.  The flow closes with seated breathing (3 minutes) and shivasana (4 minutes), and back to seated breathing. This flow was yummy.

All Downhill (43 minutes): I completed this after doing the elliptical and some of Shiva Rea's Creative Core Abs. This flow starts in a brief standing meditation and then sun salutation and moves into a warrior 2 flow (same as from Easy Street).  The next sequence includes several balance poses, including optional advanced variations. It continues with backbending and pigeon pose, this time doing a gentle backbend while lifting and grabbing the back foot during pigeon.  He then goes into a 6.5 minute stretch flow that is a shorter version of the one from Easy Street, including forward bends, upward plank, and revolved head to knee. Stretching continues with gomukhasana, spinal twist, and supine pigeon pose. The flow closes with Shivasana and moves back to seated.  I really enjoyed this flow as well, and liked the balance poses.

Hot Chocolate (57 minutes): This starts in standing moving into what Eoin calls the ultra yang sun salutation and a standing flow that includes optional crow pose and squats. It continues with some challenging butt and core toners before relaxing into the seated forward bend flow with the same poses as from Easy Street.  He then continues into challenging boat pose variations, and then relaxes again into hip openers. Next is the backbending and and pigeon pose variation that is the same as from All Downhill.  Then half wheel pose with optional full wheel.  The last cycle of poses includes happy baby, supine leg stretch, and supine gomukhasana, and then closing with Shivasana.  I really liked this flow, although it seemed a bit long by the end.  Next time I might hit the skip button to skip by the standing flow chapter to really concentrate on the core work and hip opening.  I loved the core work and boat pose variations.

World Champion's Hips (79 minutes):  I did not complete this flow, but he refers to it as the ""Full Monty"", and looks like it includes the material from the other flows.

There are also two flows that can be downloaded from Eoin's web page. There is a coupon with the DVD to download one of them for free.

All in all I really, really like this DVD and see it becoming one of my favorites.  As mentioned by others, the setting is beautiful, the narration is very good.",1278633600,9,3773,4.732415902140673
3978310,5,B002S5PSBG,"As far as DVD's for at home practice, this is THE ONE.  The hips opening poses are the deepest I've ever seen on a DVD.  And its a great deal because there are over 4 hours of Yoga.  This is a must have for anyone who is a serious at home yogi.  I love that this is not at all easy, but if you are newer to yoga or not feeling well there is an Easy Street practice and modifications for beginner ease.  I highly recommend.

.5 star off for phrases like ""juicy, honey, and sweet"", a little too cheesy for me, but in no way detracts from the goodness.",1276560000,2,549,3.9454545454545453
3978311,5,B002S5PSBG,"This is Eoin Finn's BEST yoga DVD yet! Unlike the Power Yoga For Happiness DVDs, the 4 different routines, while containing common segments, each have segments that the others do not have, so each one feels different even with the common pieces spliced in. Do any one of these 4 programs and you will feel everything from sweet to intense release in the region of your hips and glutes. This DVD is a must for people who run and strength train (like me). I actually have been using one short and one long program each week as my yoga antidote to the P90X program.
(I will say, though perhaps some would feel differently, that I would not consider this a beginner's yoga DVD, but I don't think beginners are best served learning yoga from DVDs. Live teachers are crucial to help you really understand each pose and work towards flowing into and out of a pose correctly.) So having said that, while the flows move with your breath, there is great attention paid to detail. The guidance into and through the poses, many which are unusual variations of more traditional asanas, is impeccable. And Eoin is such a beautiful and radiant being and his light shines brightly through my TV screen via this DVD.
I confess I have done this DVD probably 20 times at this writing and I have cried tears of release and joy at the end of it every single time.
Thank you Eoin Finn! You are truly a Blissologist!",1270944000,3,1393,4.509881422924901
3978312,5,B002S5PSBG,"I started with eon's podcasts.  and loved them so I splurged on this dvd.  It is the perfect mix of gentle and safe with challenging ohmygawd.  I'm not young and I have injuries and limitations yet I am able to do the classes.

I've so far done the shorter (40 and 50 minute) classes and I'm always surprised when they end.  They are so doable (which challenges my idea that if I'm doing something right I must be in agony).  No agony, but definitely stretch challenge openings wow factor.  And the visuals are beautiful and I really do feel I'm in a peaceful setting (I don't live in a peaceful setting).",1268956800,,605,4.396396396396397
3978313,5,B002S5PSBG,"I've been working my way through the 4 routines and over 4 hours of yoga that are presented on this DVD.  This yoga is, as Eoin might say, pure honey!  The hips are a huge joint, the connector between the upper and lower body.  Eoin stresses the importance of bringing good energy to the hips-- ""When we unlock the hips, stress disappears, our movements become more efficient, and our outlook on life becomes positive.""  I like positive!  This DVD definitely focuses on the hips by offering various front and back hip opening postures like stretching lunges, pigeon and cow/face variations, as well as strengthening for the hips in strong warriors, lunges, and balancing sequences.

The first routine I did was 79 minutes long, titled ""World Championships Hips.""  This was the ""big kahuna,"" offering hip work and opening, core strength sequences, and a well balanced practice of forward and back bending, and twists.  The whole shebang!

A few days later I tried the 51 minute mellow flow, ""Easy Street.""  This routine employed classical sun salutations which I LOVED, as well as a lovely mermaid stretch posture that I tucked into my ""favorites"" queue for the time being.

The following week I took it ""All Downhill"" with the 43 minute routine.  This was well balanced with just enough challenge to refresh me, but leave me feeling pretty Zen.  Hip openers here included standing pigeon and half-frog pigeon.

Finally, I finished my disc with the 57 minute ""Hot Chocolate"" flow.  This was challenging!  Chest openers were welcome in the first part of the class.  The core strengthening sequence in plank and forearm plank was demanding, but rewarded with some amazing stretching.  The relaxation was nice and long, well earned.

The music was great throughout, as were the narration voices.  Sometimes it was Eoin, sometimes a woman (who I'm guessing might be Insiya Rasiwala-Finn).  The cueing was phenomenal.  I found that I could completely listen to the cues and do the practice without watching the video at all.  The poses were broken down with great detail, without being obnoxious.  Trikonasana, for example, was set up in stages to truly feel the alignment.  The hip openers, particularly pigeons, were directed with great care.  Each pose came with an explanation- why do it, where to feel it, what to activate.  I find this approach extremely important for both beginner and experienced practitioners.  I did find myself over thinking some of the postures as I was led into them more slowly than I typically move, and for me...thinking can be dangerous.  So finding a balance here was a personal point.

Another feature I enjoyed was the relevant quotes, quips, stories, and yoga-ish thoughts that were presented between cues.  The whole package of the music, voice, and words made me feel like life was really ""all good"" as I breathed into each flow.

One aspect I did find myself wanting on was more warm-up, maybe starting a little gentler with some breath work, joint moving, and spine warming.  This is just a personal preference I suppose, and I could certainly do my own warm-ups when I do the sessions again.  The ""Easy Street"" flow offered a longer sun salutation warm-up, but the other routines jumped right into the fitness, with only one or two sun salutations.  I did appreciate the upper body strength offerings of the double chaturanga though.

Even though I could have listened to the exceptional guiding without watching the video, I couldn't help but look in awe (envy??) at the beautiful settings that the disc showed, (sunsets, mountains, urban and deserted beaches, fields of flowers) and the great supporting cast that demonstrated various options of the poses.  Although I did find myself wondering...where are all Eoin's guy friends?  As far as the technical stuff of DVD-ing goes, the production is top notch.

The DVD extras include a great section on knee safety and alignment, which is key when practicing hip opening poses in yoga.  Another extra features the connection between yoga and sports, with interviews from yogis, sports extremists, and in-betweeners, along with an ""athlete's meditation.""  The website also offers downloadable routines and PDF files of the routines.

Hips are happy, body is happy, mind is free.  Shanti Shanti Shanti!",1267056000,24,4287,5.0212765957446805

""The Pursuit of Happy Hips"" is his latest DVD and does not disappoint. It is very similar in style and asanas found on the Power Yoga for Happiness titles, however, there is definitely an emphasis on your hips. There are 4 separate Yoga routines on this single DVD. A 50 minute relaxed class focusing on stretching and meditative movement. A ~50 minute physical class that is similar to the ""Strength"" and ""Hip"" class on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Yoga-for-Happiness/dp/B00013A0GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Yoga for Happiness</a>, a shorter version of the physical class (~40 minutes), and a hardcore 80 minute routine. Though none of the asanas are particularly acrobatic(standing pigeon to crow pose with single leg extension is as acrobatic as it gets), the routine is intense, challenging and always interesting. I have been practicing regularly for about 7 years and was amazed at the amount my hips were worked. The class is made up of Canadian Olympians and it feels the flow is geared towards athletes and skiers, but it still feels very much like a yoga class. Though I feel that PYFH1 is Eoin's best, his verbal cues are a bit quirky. In PYFH2 his quirkiness is definitely toned down, but I don't like the work out as much because the lack of backbends. I feel ""The Pursuit of Happy Hips"" is a perfect balance of the 2; a well balanced work out and positive verbal cues. Nice work.",1264032000,16,1900,6.255725190839694
3978315,5,B002S5PSBG,"What a lovely DVD!
Eoin Finn's newest DVD is in many ways his best yet.
As promised, there are four routines, ranging in length from 80 minutes to just over 40, of various degrees of difficulty.
Even though there is some overlap, I definitely didn't feel like I was doing parts of the same routine. Each practice had something absolutely to offer in terms of sequences and poses.
World Champion's Hips (80 minutes)  and Hot Chocolate (about 60 minutes) are probably my favorite (and probably more challenging than others) - they include nicely paced sun salutes and two rounds of sun salutes with extra push-ups - but only two rounds, some very nice variations of standing poses combined with shoulder and chest openers, hip opening poses, back bends (front body openers) as Eoin calls them (bow, wheel, again, with interesting variations). Hot Chocolate includes crow and some interesting squat work, WC's Hips includes some wonderful splits variations. Lovely core work is included in these segments as well.

Downhill and Easy Street are more relaxed practices, they include some sun salutations and some standing poses, lovely hip openers, Easy Street has a nice seated meditation.

All practices include wonderful hip opening work - from every angle - hip flexors, glute muscles and underlying smaller muscle groups, hamstrings, quads, etc. Each practice also offers fantastic shoulder and chest openers.

The pace of the practice is very very pleasant - there is no rush to get in and out of the pose, there is a lot of emphasis on alignment, and gradually getting into a pose deeper. There is also a lot less vinyasa than in previous DVD - i.e. once you get into seated poses you stay seated.

Eoin's narration is absolutely wonderful, playful, light and humorous (that's what we love his DVDs for) yet he provides some extremely valuable guidelines how to get into each pose correctly so it feels right, etc.

Eoin also offers some really nice insights, without being preachy or dogmatic in the slightest, he shares a lot of yogic wisdom.

The cast is great - you can tell some members are Winter sports Olympians - they use ski poles to assist with balancing poses ;)

The music is pleasant, mostly instrumental.

The background is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful.",1261958400,36,2277,4.971052631578948
3978316,4,B002S5PSBG,"I have used this dvd 3 or 4 times. I do like the relaxing aspects of it but it is very hard. I can only do the first level called easy street. I tried the 2nd level and gave up after 20 minutes.
Still I get some benefit from it although it is a bit hard on my hip muscles. I'm 50. I think it's better for younger, more flexible, and athletic people.
I do like the guy who leads the poses. He does a good job.",1323302400,2,408,3.7011494252873565

This is not ""EASY"" at all!  We can barely keep up.  Finn's voice so low & shallow, I had a hard time to understand what he is talking about. Moreover, all these yoga routines are just regular plain ones we already learned from yoga class - nothing special other than it goes through very fast & we could barely keep up.

After 15 to 20 minutes, we turned it off - a total waste of time & money.  Only reason I give 2 stars instead of one is the scenery is beautiful.

This DVD is definitely not for beginners.  Wonder where are all other reviewers from?",1300060800,5,714,4.237037037037037

I've only played a part of the long program, but after 40 minutes of sun salutations and pigeon poses, I'm limbered up and ready for hours of swing dancing.  Finn speaks to my funny bone with his Canadian surfer dialect, but more serious yoga practitioners might find his goofy similes annoying.  Personally, when he says a a position should feel chocolatey smooth or something, it makes me realize I should focus on being comfortable.",1298073600,3,472,4.662650602409639

While they are fitness-oriented, his routines contain a combination of basic and challenging poses and always modifications.  You can get sweaty and still get that ""mind-body connection thing"" that yoga should give you.

Eoin has a very nice voice and I have to say that he says the funniest things in a very serious way!  I have been mentally planning a trip to Vancouver, BC just so I can take one of his yoga classes.  This dvd was a great purchase and I would buy it again.",1297987200,2,614,4.486486486486487

I can certainly feel the stretch in my hips and can tell a difference too.  This is my first workout by Eion.  His voice is so calming and I like how he slowly and genly takes you through each move.

I've done two of the workouts, and they are really good for hip opening. The instructor is good, and very descriptive, so if you prefer to close your eyes, you can do the work out. What I don't like is how this switches from scene to scene within the same workout. One pose the class is in a meadow, the next the instructor is on the beach. I find this distracting, and as when I first do a work out, I open my eyes only between pose changes to make sure I am doing the pose correctly.  The changing scenes make me think I missed something.

8379086,4,B002S5PSBG,"This DVD is instructed by Canadian yogi and self-described ""Blissogist"" Eoin Finn.  It offers four vinyasa flow yoga practices of varying lengths, all with a strong focus on stretching the hips.  On this DVD, Finn is joined not only by his wife, Insiya, but also by a group of Winter Olympic Athletics, each of whom is performs a slightly different variation in each pose.  They are practicing in beautiful outdoor settings, and Finn instructs via voiceover.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the opportunity to preview each of the four practices, which are as follows:  Easy Street, World Champions Hips, All Downhill, and Hot Chocolate.  Finn's Blissology web site offers a PDF listing all of the poses included each of these practices, but I have provided a simple overview of each below.

EASY STREET (51 minutes)
As the title suggests, this is likely the easiest practice.  It begins in a seated meditation pose and goes through only one sun salutation round.  Standing postures including a warrior series, and once on the floor, you'll do pigeon, seated forward bends, twists, and a nice relaxation.

WORLD CHAMPION'S HIPS (79 minutes)
This challenging routine includes Finn's ""Ultra Yang"" sun salutations (which involve extra push-ups), the same warrior series, additional standing postures focused on the hips, standing and arm balance work, splints, backbends (or ""front body stretches,"" as Finn calls them), and more involved forward bends/twists.

ALL DOWNHILL (43 minutes)
Although the title and length of this practice would suggest an easy routine, Finn actually includes some challenging postures here.  After a single sun salutation flow and the warrior series, he includes the same standing and arm balance work as in the previous practice as well as a backbending series.  A forward bend series, reclined pigeon, and relaxation conclude this practice.

HOT CHOCOLATE (57 minutes)
This practice also includes Finn's challenging Ultra Yang sun salutations.  There are more unique postures weaved in here, from forearm plank to dolphin to crow to an abs series.  Forward bending, backbends, and supine work is included as well.  Finn shares the instructor duties this DVD with Insiya and what sounded like one other voice; I found this both distracting and unnecessary.

In addition to the four main practices, this DVD offers an Extras menu with features such as Athlete's Visualization, information Knee Safety, and a preview of Finn's then-upcoming&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blissology-Project/dp/B004CTI5SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blissology Project</a>&nbsp;DVD set (at that time, Blissology was called ""Yoga for Every Day"").  I have Finn's Blissology set as well, and I find that I prefer the practices on those DVDs to Pursuit of Happy Hips (PoHH).  I greatly appreciate that Blissology offers shorter practice options (25-35 minutes) for each day, whereas the shortest practice on PoHH is OVER 40 minutes long.  Furthermore, I prefer Finn's live instruction in Blissology as well as his slightly more relaxed vibe--as opposed to PoHH, which seems more athletic.

This is definitely a well-done DVD with four very nice strength-based practices.  Personally, I prefer Finn's Blissology, but others may may appreciate the variety and additional challenge that Pursuit of Happy Hips brings to their yoga collection.",1365120000,,3385,5.517441860465116

I'm a daily home yoga practitioner with an ever-expanding library of DVDs that include most of the ""titans"" (Shiva Rea, Bryan Kest, Rodney Yee, etc.) yet ""Happy Hips"" is THE video I find myself returning to when I want to relax, de-stress, and experience the peacefulness of yoga. As an advanced beginner to intermediate practitioner, I find the pacing/sequencing of these workouts challenging enough to be interesting but slow enough to keep my focus on the breath--or at least that's been true of the two easier workouts on the disk, Easy Streets and All Downhill, which are the only workouts on the disk I've tried so far. The instruction is warm, personable, clear and inspiring. Alignment instruction during the forward folds and twists is the best out there--precise and detailed. I've grown noticeably looser in my hamstrings and hips as a consequence of using this video and my runner's knee has cleared up. My only minor quibble, if you can call it that, is that the best workout from this shoot--Tantric Trails--is actually not on the DVD--you have to download it!

Through the agitation, I still go back to this dvd because it does the job.  You can choose from a 32 minute practice all the way up to I believe 80 minutes. There is overlap of material like all of his dvds, but it's okay.

I do not care about athletes being on a dvd, so I'm not impressed there.  But this is definitely worth purchasing, especially if you have a few months of practice under your belt.  It's great for the hips and there is good cueing throughout.  His wife needs to work a little on how to lead a practice.  Her voice sounds mechanical, but she doesn't have a huge part so it's okay.  Over all, this might be my favorite of his dvds.  I also really like the Power Yoga For Happiness 2: The Surf Edition.  The rest of his dvds are not worth buying if you have Happy Hips & Surf Edition.  I did not see the Blissology Project though.  It's a little too expensive.
