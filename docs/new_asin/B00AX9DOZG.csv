5525638,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Happened on this movie accidently on Pay-Per-View; chose it because of Holly Hunter -- but everyone in the cast is
absolutely fabulous.  We loved it so much we just had to buy it, and, of course, Amazon was the only place to get it, in fact sat on phone with one of Amazon's top flight staff who moved heaven and earth to find it! Please be reminded though, it is only available in U.S. in Blu-Ray format so you must have a player for that, and you
must also choose ""Englis"" before you start the film, unless of course you speak and understand Dutch. It is so
fun, and so different, I can't even begin to explain it to you, but you will truly love and enjoy this film; the acting, the directing, the scenery, the story line --- don't miss it!!!!",1374796800,12,745,4.246478873239437
5525639,4,B00AX9DOZG,"Good movie, unexpected twists.  Very different plot.",1419120000,,52,6.428571428571429
5525640,5,B00AX9DOZG,Thanks to Amazon for hosting an excellent foreign movie. Films like this aren't made in the US but they should be. Why are Americans so uptight about subtitles? This movie is partly in Dutch and partly in English. The language barrier contributes a lot to the story. People - get over your phobia about subtitles and become world citizens instead of xenophobes.,1418342400,,361,4.838709677419355
5525641,5,B00AX9DOZG,"This is a traveling story, a road trip that has lots of funny stuff & some serious stuff. It's a story about three fairly strong women who take this trip together in a beat up old RV. In a way, somewhat like Easy Rider, there's no real destination. Perhaps more like On The Road.  What really happens, in my opinion, is these three women all change, partly because of each other & partly because they start to be more of what they are, really are. That is the trip they take, the road part is just something that happens along the way. This film drew me in much more than I anticipated. Holly Hunter is, of course, Holly Hunter. Hard to go wrong there. The two sisters have this almost twins-like kind of communication that is really remarkable & comes across on screen incredibly well. The movie is a bit of magic that you do not want to miss. So don't miss it.",1416960000,,862,4.288343558282208

5525645,5,B00AX9DOZG,"I'm SO glad I watched this movie as it was great.  Ms. Hunter played a very intense roll, as usual.  The talented and beautiful Van Houten sisters from Holland are a joy to keep your eyes on.  The story is EXCELLENT -- 5 stars for the exceptional story.  5 stars for the surprise ending.  5 stars to all the talented acting and singing.  5 stars for the amazing views of New Mexico, Land of Enchantment.  Join the cast as they tour through NM and learn to love each other again, learn what's important in life, step out of their comfort zones and, we hope, go on to greater things.  Absolutely one of the best movies I've seen on Amazon Prime.",1412035200,,643,4.3

5525647,3,B00AX9DOZG,"A fairly decent movie about 2 french sisters who think they have located their biological mother, Holly Hunter, in the United States.  The movie moves at a steady pace and does keep your interest.  And the story was okay.  There is a bit of a surprise at the ending.",1411084800,,266,4.387755102040816
5525648,4,B00AX9DOZG,This was a very good movie about lost love recovered. Holly Hunter was very moving especially towards the end. It was a unique story of a family coming together after a long period of time.,1411084800,,189,4.428571428571429
5525649,4,B00AX9DOZG,Good flick.  Interesting story with some unforeseen twists.,1411084800,,59,6.375

5525651,5,B00AX9DOZG,Wow what a pleasure and a surprise. Funny in an often awkward kind of way and a plot that is super original. Plus the girls are super hot!,1409788800,,138,3.9642857142857144

5525654,5,B00AX9DOZG,I thought this movie was really special. I was surprised by how much I liked it. It was heartwarming and fun. The movie was able to take me on the journey and through its undulations I never doubted any of it. It's hard to find a movie that's vibrantly different and has depth... this one had both...,1409443200,,300,4.280701754385965
5525655,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Great example of a ""small production"" surpassing the quality and value of much bigger budget films. I was entertained far better by this than the last half dozen ""block busters"" I have seen.",1409356800,,190,4.787878787878788
5525656,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Wonderful movie. The casting was spot on. I love how it captures the true relationships between siblings. If you have a sister, every part of you will relate. And Holly Hunter is as beautiful now as always. A natural, gifted actress who brought this together perfectly.",1408665600,,269,4.869565217391305
5525657,3,B00AX9DOZG,Kinda off the wall tale of two sisters raised by gay dads who come to the states to meet the woman whom they think is their biological mother. light hearted and funny at times. Mom is really way out there. Good twist on the end.,1408060800,,228,4.088888888888889

5525659,4,B00AX9DOZG,"Cute film that reminds us to slow down and connect to those near us.  I guessed the ending early on! As a side note, Jackie brought to mind The Station Agent, another good film with a similar feel and message.",1405382400,,209,4.225
5525660,4,B00AX9DOZG,"Quirky film with interesting twist and turns to the story. The characters true nature's grow, stretch and mature. Really was good  a good flic.",1404864000,,143,4.958333333333333

5525663,5,B00AX9DOZG,This is a good story with Holly Hunter at her best. An interesting and appealing screen play. The acting is excellent.,1404259200,,118,4.666666666666667
5525664,5,B00AX9DOZG,"This is one of the best movies I've seen.  Great plot, excellent character development and it just really held my attention.  Quirky, sad, funny and fun all in one movie.  Hollywood should sit up and take notice.  Don't miss this movie!",1403827200,,236,4.682926829268292

5525666,4,B00AX9DOZG,Funny. Holly hunter was great and the twins were hilarious. I would watch it again for sure and recommend it.,1402358400,,109,4.5
5525667,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Although there seems to be a finite number of themes around which a movie can be made, this one was, for me, fresh and  intriguing.  The acting and the story line make the movie totally believable and quite humanistic -- people being who they are in life's situations.  I recommend this movie to my friends for the pure joy of being alive.",1401926400,,339,4.435483870967742
5525668,5,B00AX9DOZG,Original plot indie movie that has a bit of a twist at the end. And I always like Holly Hunter.,1401408000,,95,3.8
5525669,5,B00AX9DOZG,"I loved this movie and have watched it 3 times now with different friends.
They have all loved it also!",1401408000,,103,4.2
5525670,5,B00AX9DOZG,"The movie begins with two Dutch girls raised by a gay couple who think of their mother only as, ""the womb."" She was a surrogate for their ""dads"" and didn't have anything to do with them after she gave birth to them. Then came the phone call from the US that said their mother was hospitalized and needed family to take care of her. The girls decide to go and meet their mother. While the girls' characters are likeable, their mother--played by Holly Hunter--isn't...at first anyway. There's a surprise toward the end which will answer a lot of questions, and that statement alone is probably enough of a spoiler. I really liked the movie a lot, and I think I'll watch it again.",1401321600,,677,4.512195121951219
5525671,4,B00AX9DOZG,"I found this to be very well acted, a very good premise and the ending surprised me. I would recommend this to all my friends.
A great essay on relationships and familial bonds.",1401148800,,177,4.393939393939394
5525672,5,B00AX9DOZG,"I say ""sleeper"" because I had not seen the title before, and figured it was in quick release to video movie.  What a wonderful surprise!  I chose it because I really enjoy Holly Hunter and know that her roles are always complex and interesting.  This movie did not disappoint!  The movie has some subtitltes, but don't let that stop you, they are mostly in the beginning.  The movie is about twin girls who were born to a gay couple in Holland.  They get a note that their biological mom - the ""womb"" needs help and has no one else.  The girls go to the U.S. to find and help her.  The rest of the story is about finding each other, the strength needed to see things through and to examine their own lives, and the eventual joy the journey brings to everyone.  There is a twist at the end that I did not see coming, but it made the movie.  I highly recommend.",1401148800,2,859,4.214723926380368
5525673,3,B00AX9DOZG,"This film is a little slow moving for me, but loved (spoil alert) the twist in the endso wasn't expecting that!",1401062400,,111,4.333333333333333

5525675,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Some say it's cheesy. It's absolutely not. It's a nice movie. A movie I haven't watched anything like it in a while. Acting is great and genuine (sorry for an absurd combination of words - ""Acting"" and ""Genuine"", but that's describes it best) Great story line and a development. I recommend it to all. Watch it - you won't regret.",1400630400,,330,4.516666666666667
5525676,3,B00AX9DOZG,"This was a good movie... not great, but good. Sometimes a little corny, but I think that was the idea.  Surprise ending!!",1400630400,,121,4.5
5525677,5,B00AX9DOZG,"A wonderful, intimate ""road"" flick that re-unites a set of twins(who are as different as day and night)' and their long lost biological mother.  A truly great foreign film that will warm you!",1400371200,,191,4.787878787878788

5525679,5,B00AX9DOZG,Love it!!! So well done. Holly Hunter continues to spellbind in this roll. Not all subtitles most of the movie is in english so don't let it put you off. One of the best movies I've seen in a while.,1400025600,,198,3.975

5525681,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Heart-warming is usually a description that makes me squirm, but this is fire that stays with you. Holly Hunter is almost always a sign of a good flick, and the young'ns ain't bad either as backup. The dialogue isn't afraid to lapse into silence, and great acting sines at these moments, revealing a complexity of feelings, expressions and visual dialogue that's more articulate than a lot of scripts.",1399680000,,401,4.911764705882353
5525682,4,B00AX9DOZG,Very different but very entertaining. Acting was great and the whole story line was very easy to embrace finding myself asking what would I do while the twin sisters were echoing my responses to some of the awkward situations. I have already recommended to others. It really is a great movie to share.,1399420800,,301,4.69811320754717

5525684,4,B00AX9DOZG,"This is a need to see movie, and I give it 4 stars! Really good movie about 2 women (fraternal twins), who meet their birth mother for the first time as adults. Movie shows how all 3 women have different fears to overcome, and how eventually, they all come to care for, and enjoy each other. The movie is in Dutch and American, and the Dutch parts have subtitles. Its not a hard movie to get into, and is really, really worth your time to see it!",1399248000,,446,4.137931034482759

5525686,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Grateful these kinds of films are available for Amazon Prime. A movie with a story...a far cry from the hyperaction-focused, sexual and violent films geared towards a specific audience. A refreshing foreign-collaborative film with plenty of adventure, quirks, silly-moments, inspiration, and character development. Holly Hunter is awesome, as usual.",1398902400,4,349,6.142857142857143
5525687,5,B00AX9DOZG,A gem! I almost didn't watch this because of the subtitles. Most of the film is in English. I LOVED IT! LOVED IT!,1398729600,3,113,3.9565217391304346
5525688,4,B00AX9DOZG,I loved this film so much I invited my sister over the next night and watched it again with her. She also loved it and wants to watch it again with friends.  Subtitles are just at the beginning and then periodically throughout.,1398729600,2,227,4.404761904761905
5525689,4,B00AX9DOZG,A delightful look at family relationships and not. The surprise was welcomed and caused you to think of what does make up a relationship?,1398643200,3,137,4.75
5525690,3,B00AX9DOZG,This movie did not hold my attention.  it might be a better movie than I give it credit for - I just felt it going in a predictable direction and I was not that interested in the ride.  I am looking for something novel to watch.,1398470400,,228,3.9347826086956523
5525691,4,B00AX9DOZG,"I didn't have much hope going in, but I was quickly captivated.  It's a good girl road trip, without any real problems along the way, and I didn't see the ending coming.",1398384000,,169,4.28125
5525692,5,B00AX9DOZG,Love the story and quirky ending .  The acting by all three women is wonderful especially Holly Hunter. I enjoyed this movie!,1398038400,,125,4.681818181818182
5525693,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Anything with Holly Hunter makes me cheer even if it is ""sub-titled"".  I LOVED this show.  The twins are great! I didn't want it to end and the surprise ending made it even better.  Loved it!!!",1397779200,,193,4.305555555555555
5525694,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Time is precious and I don't like to waste it on movies that are not worth it, this one was!  It is a little story to remind us to not get so caught up in our lives that we continue to live the same way even if we are not happy.  It is about speaking up, speaking the truth, and enjoying the moments we are given.  No special effects, not expensive production, just a good movie about human relationships.  When reviewers say it is ""contrived,"" I laugh.  Movies are written for entertainment, sometimes for a message - but why do we pick them apart because a story line is simple?  I do not think the people who say these type things get the message hitting them in the head. Holly Hunter did a good job, as did the women who played the sisters.  The most important part of the movie, the second half, was in English and not subtitled allowing us to dig into the movie versus trying to read, feel, and figure out the story meaning.  Both my husband and I liked it, it was an afternoon enjoyed.",1397692800,,993,4.216931216931217
5525695,5,B00AX9DOZG,Compelling story and characters with twists and ultimately transformations. Don't be put off by the Dutch sub-titles because they are only at the start- most of the dialogue is in English. Holly Hunter & the two Dutch actors are terrific.,1397433600,,238,4.975
5525696,3,B00AX9DOZG,The show had enough entertaining elements to keep me watching.  The acting is great but the storyline is so far out of reality.  The script seemed contrived.,1397001600,,157,4.777777777777778

5525700,3,B00AX9DOZG,"You need to be in a just relaxing why not watch a movie mood.  Engaging characters but slow moving plot. Great acting by holly Hunter and the sisters. Holly hunter was on the money as the reclusive, toughness  hiding a broken heart, quirky free spirit who shows the girls who they really want to be. Nice bonus was the talented singing of  jelka van houten",1396656000,,356,4.446153846153846
5525701,5,B00AX9DOZG,I usually watch sci-fy action movies.  Not sure why decided to watch this and was completely drawn in by the story.  All three are great actresses and the interaction and what they discovered about themselves was a great story and very poignant .  You will be glad youwatched it.,1395532800,,279,4.653061224489796

5525703,4,B00AX9DOZG,"A sleeper of a movie - had never heard of it before finding it on Amazon Prime.  True, the plot moves somewhat slowly and this is not in any way an action flick.  The characters evolve over the course of the movie and it is easy to develop sympathies for each of them for different reasons - the acting was top notch across the board.  In the end, it was just entertaining and satisfying.  A glimpse into other people's lives.",1394323200,,426,4.2875
5525704,4,B00AX9DOZG,This is an excellent film in stark settings with strong elements of mystery and discovery.  Two adult sisters travel from Europe to find the hippie mother who gave birth to them.  They have been raised by their gay fathers.  You are able to see the West through their eyes and experience their attempts to relate to their mother and she to them.  In the process they explore elements of their own lives and personal issues.,1393632000,,423,4.6
5525705,5,B00AX9DOZG,"I enjoyed this road trip movie.  The interaction between the two Dutch sisters was credible and endearing.  Holly Hunter, as always, is a wonderful actress in her role as Jackie.",1393459200,,178,4.9
5525706,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Yes, it is a chick flick, but so entertaining! Everyone loved it. Holly Hunter is amazing and should have gotten more recognition for her part!!",1388448000,,144,4.8
5525707,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Jackie is an amazing movie.  It has an unusual perspective as a ""chick's road flick"", and with two of the main characters viewing the American Southwest from a European point of view, it also adds another layer of interest.  Holly Hunter's performance was her usual ""Great"" job -- and she really captured the conflicted character that she portrayed, without letting it get into self-pity, so the ultimate strength of the character dominates.  I found everything about this film to be absorbing, and usually comically ironic.  There is a very light use of sub-titles in the brief episodes when the two sisters speak in Dutch, otherwise it's all in English.  I originally saw it on a plane, and saw it again when I could get my wife and daughter together to sit down and watch it streaming on Amazon.  Nothing trite or formulaic about this movie -- a really great film, and lot's of fun.",1386201600,2,885,4.714285714285714
5525708,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Very funny movie about Dutch twins who are traveling to the US to help their sick surrogate mother, who they have never met. They try to make it a quick 'get things done' visit, and return back home quickly, but the trip soon starts turning into a live changing experience. Being a Dutch-American myself, I do recognize a lot of the cultural differences depicted in this movie, which give rise to a lot of comical situations. Be aware that this movie is sub-titled for the Dutch spoken language, which is probably about half of the dialogue in this movie.",1383436800,,555,4.616161616161616

8558784,4,B00AX9DOZG,"Well worth watching.  To be honest, though the acting was very good, and the locales, details, and action interesting, until the end I thought the plot a bit contrived, gratuitous, chain-jerking.  ***Spoiler Alert***  ""Mom and two adult daughters meet, bond, and learn something about themselves in the process.""  Or so it seemed.  But it's MORE than that.  The last 15 minutes put a different spin on all that came before, made it worthwhile and very satisfying.  Recommended.",1465430400,,477,5.116883116883117

8558790,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Excellent movie, worth seeing. Surprised with the ending.  The sub-titles aren't a distraction.",1421020800,,95,6.3076923076923075
8558791,5,B00AX9DOZG,"Love this movie, saw it twice. Quirky with a twist ending and a great overall message. Excellent acting",1419897600,,103,4.777777777777778
8558792,4,B00AX9DOZG,"A well written story about twin sisters who never knew their mother, and when they are drawn into a relationship by circumstance, they find the permission to be themselves that they were missing. The ending makes what happens between the mother and daughters even more poignant and available to us, regardless of our connection to our own moms. Well acted, and with just enough pain and humor to make it a complete experience.",1419552000,,426,4.8493150684931505
