8160585,5,B000LB4658,"This video and topic is not for the faint of heart, and Christians need to wake up to the very real threat that Zionism poses. After its origins in Christian Restorationism, where people thought they could speed up the coming of the rapture by encouraging the fulfillment of Bible prophecy--Zionism has since aligned itself to Judaism in such a way, that it is no longer separated by the masses, and even a majority of the Jewish faith. The damnable remarks of the Talmud against Gentiles (or Christians) are at the center of this video's criticism of the Jews. Lest Christians forget, the Jews fell into apostasy at the rejection of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and were cast into the wilderness. In their time in the wilderness, they took up elements of the occult like the Star of Remphan also mentioned in the Bible--the six pointed star, also referred to as the hexagram in occult circles, whose usage by the occult is even more damnable as a symbol to curse people, even being carved into occult sacrifices. It gets worse, the deeper you research objectively, and find that many of the claims of this video ring true to this day, and are consistent with Scripture. The wife of the pastor in this video who hosted it with him, Elizabeth Alynn Pike, came under severe spiritual attack from wicked people after making this video, leading to her unfortunate suicide, Yah rest her soul. You can watch this entire video on YouTube before ordering it, if you have any doubts about buying this video. Every Christian should watch this video if they are praying for truth, and buy this video to pass the truth down to generations of their families. We need to stay vigilant now more than ever, as more and more stereotyping and stigma surround the faith. There is a spiritual war happening, and it is wise to be armed and awake to the truth of what is happening in this world.",1496102400,2,1877,4.63963963963964

They know the facts of the real world. Jews are Khazars and Slavs from Russia; they have no right to return to a land they were never in by dispossessing the Arabs; Jews do run the United States and control both the government and the media; Jews are destroying the social structure and promoting obscenity and social revolution; they are destroying white middle class America; Israel is poisoning U.S. relations with the Islamic world; it is all true and the fact that Adolf Hitler would agree with it does not make it untrue.

This is an extremely well done production and it needs to be viewed, again and again, to help brainwashed Americans see where the destruction oftheir country is really coming from.",1366502400,7,869,4.832214765100671
8160587,1,B000LB4658,"This may not be the topic you think it is. Rather than pointing out the fallacies of Christian Zionism (which I mistakenly thought it was), it was focused on an interpretation of Jewish Zionism (and its insidious hold on the country).  The presenters actually use the same type of inappropriate interpretation as Christian Zionists to interpret Revelations.  However, they arrive at the opposite conclusion: one that sees Jews as the Harlot of Babylon (among other ""colorful"" terms).  In essence, the purpose of this DVD is to demonstrate how the Jews are the primary cause of all social and moral decay, not only in the United States, but in the world---throughout history (the Harlot Jew is exacting her revenge on the husband--Christ--who cast her away).

This is anti-Jewish propaganda at a level I knew existed, but would have never knowingly spent money to hear. If you hate Jews--or just need someone to blame for the world's ills--this may be the DVD for you!

Regardless of the fact that this is a pastor and his wife, their logic, rhetoric and intent doesn't stray far from that of the neo-Nazis.  Clearly, they sincerely believe what they are saying, which is why it's so sad.  There is no indication that they want us to focus on expanding the Kingdom of God in the manner Jesus prescribed.  They see the world as an evil place which is getting worse, and the cause is not even Satan--it's the Jews.",1270944000,,1411,4.777777777777778
