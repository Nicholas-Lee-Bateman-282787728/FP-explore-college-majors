2816730,5,B000PE0G0A,"Finally we get a true comic book to movie film that works!!!  True the movie does stray a little from the original comics, but it stays close enough that you still get the idea.  This movie does not take place in Warner Brother's ""Superman - The Animated Series"" universe.  There's no JLA, & Lex Luthor is a much more brutal, sinister Luthor.  This Luthor is very familiar to those familiar with the comics.  He's a take no prisoners killer.  I also like what they did with ""The Toyman"" (it's to bad he won't be around for future pics :P).  This is a PG-13 movie that deserves to be PG-13 (unlike Marvel's pathetic attempts at making animated feature films ""Ultimates/Iron Man/Doctor Strange"" YUK!), the fight scenes are brutal & you really get a sense of the power being thrown around between both Superman & Doomsday.  This is the film Warner should've made with the recent ""Superman Returns"", live action this would've been awesome.  There's a whole new voice cast that for this film that nail the characters dead on.  The animation (again unlike the Marvel animation) is truely amazing you can tell the animators really put their hearts & souls into every frame.  The return/rebirth of Superman storyline is a little different.  Rather than their being 4 Supermen taking his place their is only one.  I won't go to deep into detail as not to spoil anything for anyone, but it fits well with the story.  4 Supermen wouldn't have fit into one film & for thsi I'm glad they chose to change things rather than force it into a 90 minute movie.  The special features are great too, you get an interview with the entire team that originally killed Superman with the Doomsday story line which is really cool (just think we have ""Lois & Clark"" to thank for ""Supes"" demise:P), cast interviews & a sneak peek inside look at Warners next DC animnated film ""Justice League - The New Frontier"" which looks just as equally amazing!!  Anyway, those are my thoughts.  Anyone who's ever liked Superman needs to watch this movie.  That goes for anyone who's ever enjoyed animated films as well.  This is a well put together film that I think everyone will enjoy.  Buy This Movie!!!",1189296000,17,2166,4.66490765171504
2816731,2,B000PE0G0A,"Being a longtime DCAU fan, I was very much looking forward to seeing this.  I knew with Duane Capizzi writing, the man responsible for Superman:Brainiac Attacks, that could mean trouble.  Except I held out hope, knowing that the source material he was adapting it from was good, and that Bruce Timm was on board to steer this in the right direction.

Now I understand full well that this story is not connected to the DCAU, and is a stand alone movie, but I still can't help wishing they had stuck with the original voice actors.  They just couldn't resist casting name actors to draw more fans in I suppose and while Adam Baldwin is an ok Superman, Anne Heche doesn't hold a candle to Dana Delaney's Lois, and I won't even get started on the downgrade with Luthor.  This is quite disappointing considering Andrea Romano's voice casting is usually spot on.

But enough about the actors.  My biggest problem with this is that what could have been three great movies, turned out to be one sub par movie.  I understand from being at the q&a panel that the idea was to condense the story, make it simpler, and let it stand alone as just a Superman story.  The idea sounds ok in theory, but it just makes the movie feel cheap, like we're getting the cliff's notes version when I'd rather be seeing the unabridged epic with a full story of supporting characters.  I was really hoping to see a cliffhanger ending, something to indicate that this is not the end, but alas there was no Empire Strikes Back moment to relish in.

The animation doesn't stray too much from Timm's style, which is visually pleasing but makes the fact that the voices are radically different that much more irritating.  I will say that the fight between Supes and Doomsday is really something.  That alone is worth two stars.  Just the right length and even more brutal than the fight they had in JLU.  I will watch it again just for that.

There's a few other surprises and character moments to behold that are enjoyable.  I just can't help imagining what it could have been had they done it right and adapted the entire story as opposed to giving us a taste test of one of the most definitive Superman stories ever told.",1188345600,14,2191,4.534351145038168
2816732,2,B000PE0G0A,"i had high hopes for this movie...i volunteered at the san diego comic con this past july just to see the premiere of the movie.  i was dissappointed that this was a stand alone story that had no connection to any previous superman storylines - be it animated or from the comics.  the animation itself was decent but the weird lines on superman's face just bugged me right from the opening scene and throughout the movie...lois and luthor looked poor as well.

doomsday lacked presence in the movie...he was all ready introduced in the justice league animated series (with the justice lord superman easily defeating him).  they could have done more with him, this movie could have been retitled ""superman and another lex luthor plans to take over the world with some lucky circumstances"".

everything seemed rushed in the movie - doomsday's appearance, doomsday's death, superman's return to life (or so it seemed), superman's return to stop luthor plans.  the only thing that was drawn out was superman's relationship with lois - long and lame.

the voice casting could've been anyone; famous (or recognizeable names don't make for a great animiated movie).

overall, the movie was not a super attempt for dc's direct to dvd animated movies.",1186876800,15,1242,4.966183574879227
2816733,5,B000PE0G0A,"Phenomenal.

I can't even express how impressed i was with this movie.

Is it the comic?  not really.  does that matter?  hell no.  this movie is based on ""The Death of Superman,"" yes, but they never said it would be exactly the same.  did they follow the basic premise and capture the essence of the story?  hell yes, they did.  and they translated all the most important parts of the story while still making it their own.

denying the pure quality of the movie itself is just a practice in bad taste.  keep in mind that most of the people who will bash this movie for not being an exact adaptation of the three graphic novels it pulls inspiration from are probably the same people who own all box-sets of S:TAS and consider them to be bar-setting quality in Superhero television.  was S:TAS exactly like the comics?  hell no.  in fact, to compare them on those grounds is just rediculous... they're about as different as they can possibly be, without S:TAS destroying the superman comic mythos.  the key is that they kept the important parts the same, and delivered high quality writing, animation, etc. while still being allowed to add their own flavor to the stories.

the route they took with this movie was, i think, perfect for what they were aiming to do.  they wanted to bring the classic story to the screen without bogging it down with all of the unnecessary plot tangents that drag the focus off of Superman himself.  because that's what's important.  Superman's death is what sold those comics, not the inclusion of the JLA.  and then, subsequently, Superman's return from death after much mourning is done by the Man of Steel's loved (and not so loved) ones.  all of this was captured flawlessly in the film and i think it deserves the highest of ratings for what it accomplishes in it's relatively short running time (even though the sheer scope of it makes it feel far more substancial than any other 70-80 minute movie i've seen).

basically, to wrap up, this movie exceeded my already high expectations and as far as i'm concerned, they already have my money when the Dvd is released.

i highly recommend it and suggest that you, at the very least, rent it regardless of any doubts.",1186272000,37,2201,4.630490956072351
2816734,2,B000PE0G0A,"I recently saw this at Comic Con San Diego special preview.  If you have not seen the plot outlines of this adaptation, you're in for a shock.  First off, it's PG-13... so that means people die, not in a grotesque manner, but certainly more graphic then past DCAU ventures.  Also another huge point is the recasting of EVERYONE who was ever involved in the Superman TAS.  The casting choices, cept for Adam Baldwin as Superman, I felt was not on par with the original cast of the Animated Series.
The Rest of this may contain spoilers... do not read further if you want a surprise, but just know that I thought the movie could have been much better.
SPOILERS!!!!

The story itself?  3 huge comics shortened to one movie with a running time of less then 2 hours?  They skimped out on a lot, most notably Doomsday getting less then 20 min of screen time.  I find this horrific, considering I loved the Death of Superman.  Not only does Doomsday get gypped, but also the fact that it is only Superman fighting him, no other members of the Justice League get involved, or mentioned, which made me feel the sense of urgency for Superman to get involved feel not nearly as urgent.  I also hated that the Doomsday costume like in the comic, wasn't used, I always liked that he was revealed slowly, giving you horrifying glimpses of his true nature.  Then of course, a world without superman and the return of superman are equally short, giving you no loss of time with superman's departure or his return, with the many superman wannabes.  IN all, I thought this could have been A GREAT two part movie, which would've made me leap for joy, instead one 75 min piece o' crud that made me run out of the screening without even looking at the man I once thought great, Bruce Timm.  Sold out to promote a movie they took from a great story, and trashed it to give me this.  If they're trying to compete with the Marvel direct to video movies, I say go for it, they're not that good.  But if they're trying to sink to the Marvel level?  that's just bad.  It's not as bad as Brainiac Attacks, but I was hoping for much better",1185753600,17,2110,4.410852713178294
2816735,1,B000PE0G0A,"I caught the premiere at the San Diego Comic-con, and if your an avid of the Superman mythology than it might upset you when someone comes along and messes up the storyline. I'll admit the animation was very good but the artwork was too cartoony and the character voices were at most unbearable. As for the story line the entire arc Reign of the Supermen was cut out of the movie. There was no Steel, no Superman Cyborg, no Superboy. If DC is going to try and keep up with Marvel on their Direct to DVD releases then they definitely need to amp up their material. If its a budget issue than just don't make the movie, I would rather the movie never be made than be made as badly as it was.",1185494400,13,689,4.18796992481203
2816736,5,B000PE0G0A,"I don't care if it was just a marketing ploy...it caught everyone's attention. As a kid, I remember buying the graphic novel at a gas station and running home to read it. Was I the only one crying as he died in Lois's arms? At the time, it seemed like the end of an era. And brace yourselves for this...BRUCE TIMM is involved, he's THE producer actually! It will resemble animation from DCAU but it's a stand alone story. C'mon am I the only one that wanted to see Supes die when he fought Doomsday in the Justice League cartoon, but they had to tone it down for the kids. Now we have an official PG-13 release. LONG LIVE BRUCE TIMM AND PAUL DINI!! and here's to hoping that the Justice League and Teen Titan releases are outstanding!",1183680000,17,734,4.326086956521739
2816737,3,B000PE0G0A,"I could only give this production three stars. While not the best animated film in the world, it wasn't the worst either. The fight between Superman and Doomsday was great, I just thought the story lacked some depth.

Adam Baldwin was surprisingly good as Superman. Didn't really care for Anne Heche as Lois though. James is good as Lex Luthor but Clancy Brown is definitely better. Overall, I was fairly satisfied but I do agree that it could've been better.

The extras were interesting. I particularly liked the look back at the original comic version of this film as well as the sneak peek at Justice League: A New Frontier as they are looking to go old school with it. It will be interesting to see it when it comes out!

Back to this product, if you can rent it first before buying to see if you'd want to keep this product. My final verdict: Not great but it doesn't suck either. Just lacks some depth in story telling. But look on the bright side, at least it wasn't Braniac Attacks!

On that note, even though it is animated, THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS! I am not Pat Robertson or anything but I definitely would not let child under the age of 13 watch this one. There are parts that are too violent and/or inapropriate for young viewers. Particularly the fight with Superman and Doomsday and some of the interactions between Superman and Lois (which are clean but clearly suggestive in the intimately sexual sense).",1182470400,,1418,4.549019607843137

2816758,5,B000PE0G0A,"Just finished watching ""Superman:  Doomsday"" released by Warner Brothers.
While ""Superman:  Doomsday"" does incorporate some of the elements from the original ""Death of Superman"" story line that ran in DC comics nearly 15-years ago, it is not a faithful adaptation.  For example, do not look to see multiple Supermen pop up to take over for the late Superman, who dies defeating Doomsday - that a team of scientists working for LexCorp dug up while doing an illegal mining project designed to harness the energy at Earth's core.
There is plenty of implied sex between Superman and Lois Lane - who are in a romantic relationship; but while Lois knows Clark Kent is Superman, he's still not comfortable telling her the truth about his secret identity in order to protect her.  ""Hey, it's already news that we're a couple,"" Lois tells Superman.
It's interesting to see how Jimmy Olsen and Perry White fall apart after Superman's death.  Jimmy is seduced away from the Daily Planet for a higher paying job and Perry starts to drinking.  It's implied Jimmy is gay and Perry is an alcoholic.
Lex is busy behind the scenes, scheming to make the best use of Superman's death to his advantage, which he does in a rather horrific way.
Throughout engrossing and engaging, despite the changes to the original ""Death of Superman"" story line.

2816810,3,B000PE0G0A,Well this was as close to a Superman Lives as we will see. This movie was a pretty good interpretation of The Death of Superman comic though with a few changes here and there. The view of the animation made it look and feel like the 1990's Superman: The Animated Series which was portrayal of Superman I actually didn't hate unlike most iterations.,1454544000,,348,4.5396825396825395

2816813,5,B000PE0G0A,"The story of this movie isn't 100% identical to the death and return of the Superman comic because the movie tells Superman's death and return in a different way. It's not bad, it's just different, I thought the animation was good, the story was ok and the voice actors were amazing. If you read the death and return of Superman comics before you watched this movie you will know some big changes the in the movie they did not add and if you watch the movie before you read the comics then you will realize that they forgot to add some stuff in the movie. I thought the movie was good, I give it a 10/10 and I understand why they didn't add a lot of the elements from the comics in the movie because the movie would have been too long. Superman: Doomsday is a great Superman animated movie.",1452470400,,790,4.273333333333333

2816835,3,B000PE0G0A,"I started collecting real (Physical)  Comic Books  around 1990
So I remember one of the greatest Grifts/Cons, Marketing Angles ever done in Pop Culture
That Con being The Death of Superman
This Story line would be both  a blessing and a course for the comic book industry
It would get national/global press But, it would also start a chain of events that would almost bankrupt the comic book industry as a whole
and lead to a crash that has Never fully recovered from.......

The story was simple ""create"" a killing machine
Tease this Monster months in advance w/ a cleaver adds in all DC comics
then start slowly introducing the assassin with a page at the end of every Superman title
Until you reach the Death of Superman story line crossover
Having the monster tear through the planet killing and destroying everything in it's path until it wind up in Superman's backyard after almost killing the '92 Version of the Justice League members anyway he finally meets the man of steel!
Superman meets his match in Doomsday
There battle is somewhat anti climatic
Both Superman and Doomsday beat each other to death
Superman sacrifices him self to save Metropolis and the people he loves
Everything ended in the pages of Superman number #75
Did I mention the massive hype this was (This is pre Internet If you tried to pre order Superman 75
Guess what SOLD OUT (It has yet to be even released but, It's sold out really?)
DC did a lot of shady things during this time
The global spotlight was on them so they milked it and every comic book fan
Superman #75 wasn't good enough how about a black poly bag bleeding S Limited edition w/ a black arm band and phony Daily Planet newspaper cover  with the Story of Superman's Death wait a second  let's seal it in that  poly bag  that way the marks I mean fans will buy two copies of the limited 'f' you""  edition
The Death of Superman was the start of the comic book industry just flat out screwing the fans/consumers every which way but, up
Superman 75 started this bs trend where the regular edition of anything wasn't enough let's do 5 different variant  covers a 1/2, a gold edition, a silver edition, a nude variant cover, and so.. (look-up any of these comic book variant covers) It's all true
All this insane greed would catch up to all of them

So Krypton's last son was gone.................
DC thinking logically wasn't gonna happen they made money hand over fist so what now you ask?
Oh yeah let's run a 6 issue  ""Funeral for a Friend,"" story line to take more quick cash from the marks ""cough cough"" fans
so they did $1.50 x 6 issues  =$9.00
for comic books that has the Superman title but, no bloody Superman
Supergirl did get a few stand alone issues during the Funeral for a Friend Story
let's all mourn fictitious comic book character for 6 months....
The Funeral for a Friend Story arc ended you'd think DC would stop putting out Superman titles for a while I mean he's dead and  buried!
Nah let's really jerk the consumers around with the convoluted  Reign of the Supermen epic year round money grab
We are gonna Introduce 4 characters who ""each"" claim to be the real Superman
and put each Superman in there own book (Superman, Action Comics, Man of Steel, and the Adventures of Superman) That's 4 different comics a month at a $1.50 a pop do the math not counting the insane Deluxe edition premier issues that cost more cause they had a wrap-around second cover!
Reign was a over-blown story that was drawn out just to make quick cash,change a few characters turn Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) Into a villain which in IMO was the only interesting idea to come out of Reign!
And in the end Superman much like Jesus Christ returned from the dead  (at first all in black with a white S and longer hair)
But, so did Doomsday for that matter
So the Death of Superman was nothing more then a attention seeking marketing gimmick
DC should have done the smart thing and pulled all 4 Superman titles from the monthly release dates for at least a year after his death
It would've meant something when they brought him back
But, nope they just had to be greedy and stupid.

DC would try and pull the same type of gimmicky ""PR"" with Batman and the Knightfall story line (which was a much smarter story all around) Even though DC also dragged that out with a ""new"" darker Batman in Azrael
 ""Knightfall"" would bleed into ""Knightquest"", and  conclude with ""KnightsEnd""
This massive story arc to would be drawn out and over-blownand in the end Batman would return much like Superman
DC Comics were not the only ones guilty of this Marvel did plenty of odd year round story lines just for cheap press and quick money
(Spider man Maximum Carnage,  Maxim Clonage) X-Men:  Fatal Attractions,  Age of Apocalypse, & Onslaught ,  Fantastic Four Killing of Reed Richards) there's a laundry list of poor choices made by every big company at the time when comics were massive (mid 90's)

This ""new"" collection is not new WB is putting out the Superman Doomsday animated feature film for the 3rd time on Blu Ray/dvd Combo
with the graphic novel! my God since nobody has the bloody graphic novel by now!
The film as a whole is a let down due to WB/DC condensing Death, Funeral and Reign of Superman into one flick
which at the end of the day takes a lot away from the whole Death of Superman story
The animation and v/o actors are all good but, the films writing is horrid and seems rushed
They should've done a complete Superman Doomsday animated feature
Then put out a second BR/DVD with Superman Funeral  for a friend
Then top it off with a full animated feature of Superman: Reign of Superman
Now DC is pulling back on being money hungry?!?!?!

This is the closet thing we'll ever get to a Death of Superman Film
There was lots of talks in Wizard Magazine in 1994 that Kevin Smith was writing a script for a live action Superman/Doomsday Film
Not sure what happened with that it might have been cool to see a live action Doomsday  (But, then again with  digital f/x who knows how good it would look?)
It's without a doubt the weakest DC Animated  Film due to the story problems it's worth watching one time
But, it will in no way blow you away  7.5/10
The special features are very interesting and cool and make it a must see (I just wish the people from DC  were more honest about how they milked the fan base just to make quick cash and get easy media attention)",1439337600,3,6395,4.5012964563526365
2816836,5,B000PE0G0A,"This review is based on the product and packaging, not the movie itself.

I am really pleased with this.  I don't have this graphic novel (but it is my favorite Superman story) or the Blu-Ray version of the movie, so it seemed like a smart purchase. I couldn't find any explanation about how it was packaged, and to be honest, I was preparing myself for a movie case and a digital copy of the graphic novel.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The graphic novel is a hard cover book, and it houses the Blu-Ray and DVD discs. I like it, and it is pretty creative. It might annoy certain people however.

This product is almost the cost of just the graphic novel, so this is the smart thing to buy if you want either the book or the movie (or both!).

It's a great purchase, and I don't regret it one bit.",1439251200,14,802,4.209150326797386

2816875,3,B000PE0G0A,"There is no way you can tell this amazing story with just one movie. Everything in this movie felt rushed(which it was). It should have been 3 parts.

Movie 1: Should have followed the epic fight between Doomsday and Superman throughout the whole movie. Ultimately leading to the death of superman

Movie 2: Should have seen the effect that supermans death had on the world and the Justice League(which were missing from the movie but we will get into that). Movie 2 also should have seen the rise of the fake supermen.

Movie 3: Movie 3 deals with with the fake supermen and ultimately supermans ""resurrection.""

So the lack of Justice League hurt the movie also. The Justice League were a vital part of the Doomsday story. I'm still hoping we will see a great death of superman movie.. While this movie isn't bad, but it wasn't the epic death of superman story we all hoped for. If you want to get the true death of superman story, grab the death of superman graphic novel, Funeral For a Friend and the Return of Superman.

It looks like a story that could have fit in with the main DCAU if it weren't for all the changes that were made to the characters. The voice actors are also very suitable for the roles they end up playing, though I would have preferred those from Superman: The Animated Series or the Justice League since they seem to fit the art style of the characters.",1408320000,,626,4.358974358974359
2816882,3,B000PE0G0A,"a decent effort but not the best, and when you get spoiled with the quality and engaging content of the latest animated features from DC and others, i was a bit disappointed with this movie. First and foremost, the animation was a bit sub par, especially when it comes to superman and lois lane. They look so different from their TV series counterparts, though you have to be a fan of the series to notice. Especially troubling is superpan's face. Animators tried to make him older and more distinctive and ended up making him look ragged. It almost looks like Sup got a really bad plastic surgery and now has scars on his face. And Lois is looking like a young latina woman, with dark hair and dark eyes... again not even close to the tv series representation. The voice acting was ok, for the most part, but Luthor didn't come across as menacing enough and the story line was simplified down to the point of being lame. I found myself wanting the movie to end, which is never a good sign. So overall, with the exception of a few instances (mostly involving Luthor), i was not impressed with this movie and regret purchasing it.

2816891,1,B000PE0G0A,I grew up watching superman on TV and got used to George Reeves doing the acting to make Superman become alive in your imagination. So a cartoon Superman goes totally against the grain of making it alive in your imagination. They should leave animated superman for the comic books.,1396569600,,281,4.755102040816326

Prior to watching though, I read some comments & it seems that most of the fans that didn't really like it, were those most noted for their comic knowledge. I don't follow the comic much if any so i chose to base my own conclusion.
I liked this film and thought it had a great story to it. I have zero things to say on the negative side. I thought the art was great and the fighting scenes even better. I would recommend to any fan of Superman.

Hardcore fans (myself included) would probably prefer a more faithful version of this story.  It should be told through a trilogy.  You start with the Death of Superman, then view a Year without Superman, and finally end with ""The Reign of the Supermen"".  I would have liked to see Doomsday take down the Justice League and the other Meta humans to show the sheer destructive and and unapologetic menace he is.  Still this may have been a watered down version, but it was still pretty good.  I would have to say that All-Star Superman was worth 5 stars.  Whlie this could have used more elements from the story, it was still pretty darn good.",1395187200,3,793,4.451388888888889

2816918,2,B000PE0G0A,"No longer collect comics, still occasionally read them since my best friend owns a Comic Book Store. I read ""some"" of the death of Superman issues, but they are not why I disliked this film.
 Superman continually does things that the character would never do. Primarily massive collateral death throughout; at one point he flies into space and instead of the unpopulated ANYWHERE on Earth, Superman drops a bomb on the city killing hundreds of thousands(?) while leveling a huge chunk of the city; all while leaving me wonder why not straight into the Sun or at least on trajectory for a black hole (terrible writing throughout). To note: I am not offended by the death in the movie, in fact the realism is a nice addition although a bit graphic for youngsters simply meaning it was geared towards a more aged audience.
 Bad guy is Bad As Tuff, okay no problem, but Superman weakens Far Too Quickly it is more like kinda sorta semi-superman. This seems to be done to allow a very long and poorly written character evaluation of Sups death on everyone that drags on & on. I am tired of complaining (err criticin) now, I did not hate it just did not appreciate the misrepresentation and stupidity of Superman here.",1394841600,,1212,4.658878504672897

In my humble opinion, they should have gone the way the comic book path and build up Doomsday as the unstoppable monster he was in the comics who tore through the Justice League like they were made of paper leading up to the epic battle with Superman. A subsequent 2 disc (like Dark Knight Returns) could have touched upon the aftermath and subsequent return of our hero.

This adaptation should appeal to a wide range of viewers ,but I wouldn't let younger viewers watch it...it's more of a pre-teen to adult type flick with some language, and insinuation that really wasn't needed to convey the story.

2816984,3,B000PE0G0A,"Let me first say that I don't think a movie needs to be totally faithful to the original source material. I've never seen any correlation between faithfulness and quality, with some terrible movies that are totally faithful and some superb movies that are only marginally related to the original. In this case, the movie is loosely based on three comic sequences: telling the story of the death of superman, the world without a superman, and the return of superman. The video covers all three of these in just 87 minutes, although it gives relatively short shrift to the center story.

In the first section, we see Superman battling an indestructible, unstoppable force, a doomsday weapon whose mission is to destroy all life it encounters. The weapon was locked away on Earth centuries ago but was uncovered by an expedition from Luthor, seeking new energy sources. Superman succeeds in stopping Doomsay but I don't think it is a spoiler to reveal that the victory comes at the cost of his life.

The second section is fairly brief, with a look at the impact of the death of Superman, as crime increases, the world mourns, and even Luthor is upset at the loss because he feels that he was robbed of his chance at defeating Superman, once and for all. Finally, in the third section, we see what appears to be Superman reborn, but is he? Something has changed, and not in a good way.

So how is this as a video? Just middlin', which is why I've given it three stars (I'm being a bit charitable since I'd like to give it 2.5 stars). It's not terrible but it definitely could have been better. The three elements of a good animated video are the voice acting, the quality of the animation, and, above all, the story. The voice acting is just fair, overall. Adam Baldwin does a decent job as Superman but James Marsters' Luthor is too cerebral, lacking the passion that usually accompanies that role, and Anne Heche as Lois Lane appears to be on auto-pilot for much of the movie. She needs to be the heart of the movie, as we witness these events through her eyes, but she is simply not up to the challenge.

Similarly, the animation is middle-of-the-road, neither terrible nor wonderful. There were no sequences that really blew me away and Superman's face, in particular, bothered me, as they used a crude line to indicate cheekbones. It made it look like Superman had some kind of facial tattoos.

The story is also lacking a bit, as they tried to squeeze too much into too small a time. I think they'd have been better served by releasing this in two parts, which would have allowed them to add the elements to make the whole story more compelling. As it is, the video basically consists of two massive slug-fests, with just enough filler to make it a bit more interesting. i like a good fight sequence as much as anyone but I also like a little more variety. In particular, I'd have liked to see a bit more setup, to show how deadly Doomsday really was and how Superman really was the last and only hope for defeating it.

As I said, it's not a terrible movie and as an inexpensive rental, it's worth a look.",1390694400,,3109,4.552772808586762

For starters, someone made the movie and I'm glad they did. I just wish they would have made it longer and not left sooo much out. Two parter even? All in all it was worth the watch.

of course...Superman/Doomsday.
Which leads to this review. Superman/Doomsday is a long storyline in comic form that crossed over that multiple titles. Compressed to the animated form is well done...story wise. Many characters were not featured in this animated but that is a whole lot of stories to cram into. So the animators stuck to the gist with one storyline. Superman fights Doomsday to the bitter end. The story continues in Supes' resurrection. As always, Lex Luthor is the maniacal genius obessed with Superman. He is obsessed with killing Superman. Since he couldn't....he had to control him with the faux Superman. The Toyman storyline is a twist I didn't see coming. Kudos. All great stories compressed into a feature well done.
Now the animation...would I had liked it to be like the others? Of course. The only other one I think that could had been better animation is Superman vs the Elite. All my DC collection is well liked. I think that DC animated teams are well done.
In hindsight...could Superman/Doomsday used The Dark Knight Returns treatment? Perhaps. But I would had liked the animation somehow better.
All in all...GREAT animated features. I like my collection.",1387497600,,1456,4.995884773662551

2817056,2,B000PE0G0A,There was drama and darkness when the Death of Superman story arc happened in the comics. You will not find most of that in this animated movie. Superman: Doomsday is a highly abridged version of the story meant to be age-appropriate it seems for the under-13 audience.,1386374400,,269,4.74468085106383

The casting director really could have picked better people to play the voices here.  Don't get me wrong, I like Adam Baldwin, but this was not a good fit for him.  As for the plot, well I'm sure there is one in there somewhere, but I couldn't find it.

So why 2.5 stars?  Well, it is a decent way to kill some time if you need to, and I'm an Amazon Prime member, so it's free for me to watch.  Watching this on your computer while hoping to go to sleep?  Good Paying actual money for this? Bad.",1383609600,,648,4.05511811023622

2817077,4,B000PE0G0A,VERY few superhero animated movies turn our excellent. This one fairly well balanced considering it was not 6 hours long. Superman looks like he aged the human equivalent of at least two decades but it's easily ignorable. Watch it and if the price is right get it.,1381449600,,264,4.638297872340425

2817090,1,B000PE0G0A,Just terrible. I could barely watch the end. I know that Doomsday kills but they make him out to be so tough and stuff but superman kills him so easily and they says he's tired and that's it. Most of the story isn't even about doomsday,1379116800,,235,4.130434782608695

2817100,4,B000PE0G0A,Good story line - the man of steel is protrayed as more human and contrasted against unreasoning use of power to impress an agenda. A viable entertainment alternative to the drivel on cable.,1378339200,,190,4.787878787878788

2817103,5,B000PE0G0A,"OK, I have to admit I am a relative newbie to the contemporary Justice League series.  I am a huge fan of the original Superfriends, and up until recently hadn't really heard much about the newer versions of the superheroes I grew up with.  But on one of the Superfriends DVDs, there was a preview for this movie - Superman: Doomsday - and I had to see what it was all about.  And after seeing it....I loved it.

The story was action packed, suspenseful, and interesting.  It provided a whole new perspective to the Superman mythos - that of a dark society and a group of villains who were not hesitant to kill innocents.  The fact that this cartoon showed the degree of genuine violence it did shocked me a bit, but given the 'adult' nature of this cartoon, it was appropriate.  The re-imagining of many of the characters was great, and the way the movie ended was intriguing as well.  Overall, this was an enjoyable movie to watch, and it provided what I was looking for - namely, entertainment in the form of a new look to the Superman story.

Would I have liked a bit more detail in some of the story elements?  Sure.  I would have liked to hear more background about Lex Luthor and his plot to genetically engineer a group of Supermen.  I would also have liked to learn more about how Superman is reincarnated.  There could have been more detailed story lines, and more character development.  But even without any of these things, the movie was still great.

To those naysayers, I am sure that if you really compared this to the earlier comics and the overall story line of Superman, there may have been flaws.  But I would venture to say that the flaws in this updated version were no worse than the flaws in the 1970s and 1980s versions of the Superfriends.  So can't we just accept that this movie was entertainment and it achieved its goal?  I did.

If you liked the earlier Superfriends and were a Justice League virgin like myself, then I would highly recommend this movie.  And once you've seen this, move on to the other movies, which is what I intend to do next!",1377993600,2,2077,4.458885941644563

I remember there was more carnage and a lot more to it than this 1 hour 15 min movie showed. Even though it wasn't as I remember it I still gave it a chance and watched the movie to the end, but I must say that

 **Spoiler Alert**

I was actually rooting for the clone Superman because he wasn't as naive as the real Superman. What is it with these Super heroes who refuse to do what's necessary to stop villains before they murder again. For example Lex Luthor, he's obviously a psychopath, why has Superman kept the little twerp alive, only to murder more of Metropolis's citizens through his wicked schemes. If this movie portrayed anything correctly it's that evil corporations are protected by the government.

2817115,3,B000PE0G0A,"Directly after watching this I hated this movie for the following reasons:
1. Doomsday demolishing other JLA members was absent.  I understand that Images cost money, but if you want to portray the strength of Doomsday, even a MENTION of the others he tore through would have been at least a nod.
2. For being a co-headliner, Doomsday is in the movie all of 20 minutes.
3. No mention of the 4 supermen(Superboy, Supergirl, Steel, & Cyborg) that appeared in place of the one true Superman. (After reading some of the other reviews I do concede that there were aspects of the other 4 in the one clone and it may have taken WAY to much time to do each one)
4. While I understand and can tolerate the addition to Lex Luthor to the movie, I do not see the relevance of adding him to the discovery (although it was accidental) of Doomsday.  Him being a part of the cloning process, I can tolerate, but to have him full on involved from the start bothered me.
5. Some of the animation bothered me.  Supermans face had definition lines that were very distracting and Lex Luthor looked like a meth addict.  Never have I seen Lex as this huge guy, but I also did not see him as a twig.
While I DO recognize the story was changed do to time and media format, there are several things they could have done IMHO to add to the grandiose feeling that the comics gave you.
1. As I mentioned before, at least mention that other superheros had failed in an attempt to stop Doomsday.  Although to me, the issue of money to not show them is ridiculous.  When you are making a movie of one of the most historical events in comics history, spend some damn money on it and do it justice.
2. This should have been a 2 part movie (a la Dark Knight Returns).  This way, the first movie is Doomsday intro/fight.  The second movie is the fall out of no superman and clone/4 supermen
3. If you do not have time for the 4 new supermen, the Lex story is a great avenue to take.  You add a very well-known Superman villain that sees his opportunity and takes it.  All of that could have been covered in much better detail if you have a whole movie to set up that plot as opposed to a half a movie.
4. As a fun little Easter egg, add a few seconds at the end of previous Superman or JLA movies with the pounding fist of Doomsday as they did in the comics.
I truly feel this story was not handled the way the monumental occasion should have been handled via film.  It felt like it was rushed out with little consideration to the true feel of the story. My heart just wishes more thought was given to how important this story was.
After letting it digest a little, I do not hate this movie as was my first reaction.  I always have to take some book to movie transfers with a grain of salt, this one was just a bit bigger than I am used to.  If you like Superman, but are not a fanboy and read everything out there, you will really like this movie.  If you are that fanboy who has yet to see this, all I can say is be prepared to swallow a bit of salt!",1376870400,,3016,4.168674698795181

I can definitely suspend my disbelief but when a character is written so poorly as to not demonstrate a shred of logic to the decisions they make, I just have to shake my head and ask who thought this would be a good idea.  To me, again not a comic book reader, the fact that Superman didn't just take Doomsday up into space and toss him into the Sun makes absolutely no sense.  It sure didn't seem like Doomsday could fly so Superman had a very easy solution.  Instead, he decides to slug it out?  Come on!  Ridiculous.  Also, if Superman is supposed to be so concerned about keeping people safe, wouldn't he have, at least, thought to smash Doomsday into the earth not in the middle of the city?  Again, what a moron.

So, if that isn't bad enough, Superman vs. Clone again shows what a complete imbecile Superman is.  He doesn't wait to fire the kryptonite gun when he knows he can make the shot, he pulls it out right from the get go and fires from far away.  What an idiot!  Hasn't he EVER watched TV?  I think most 9 year-old boys who play any kind of 1st-person shooter game would have made a better decision than the Man of Steel.

At the end of the day, here really isn't ANYTHING that I can recommend about this movie.  Started dumb, middle was annoying, ending was lame.  Enjoy watching!",1376179200,6,1665,4.4

2817129,2,B000PE0G0A,"I think I first saw clips of this film on Youtube. Somebody was trying to show what a real knock-down drag-out fight with Superman would look like. For what it's worth the fight against this movie's Doomsday is visually impressive and properly epic. Spoiler alert... that's the first third of the movie.

Rather, this movie actually isn't about Superman versus Doomsday, or at least the comic version of Doomsday. This Doomsday is merely a genetic weapon. The film, instead, is a retelling of the ""Death of Superman"" storyline. A horribly... butchered... retelling. There is no Metropolis Kid. There is no John Henry Irons. There is no Eradicator. There is no Cyborg Superman. We do get a Lex Luther clone.

Fans of Superman might already be cringing... which leads into the other problem. This was the first direct-to-video DC Animated Universe Original Movie. There wasn't going to be anybody buying this film other than comic book fans familiar with Doomsday, familiar with the Animated Universe, or just familiar with the Superman mythos. The film is not targeted towards the people who would be buying the film... but to... I don't know... everybody who wouldn't be buying the film.

Much like the Wonder Woman film I just watched we get quite a bit of dialog centered around setting some characters up; while others have random plot motivation changes that occurred in the Comic Book Series take all of 10 seconds on film. The story pacing is abysmal; although in fairness this was the first time the studio had attempted a film over a television show.

This animated adaptation of the death and rebirth of Superman was enjoyable to watch, though nothing super. The first half was fun, as it feels very close to the actual battle Superman has with Doomsday. However, the later half, felt a bit off (it has been a long while since I read the original, so my memory can be somewhat fuzzy). The antagonist of the second half was a clone Superman created by Lex Luthor. I remember there being a whole host of Supermen coming out to take up the crime fighting slack after Superman's death to Doomsday. There were for Supermen who entered the fray: John Henry Irons--The Man of Steel and the only one of the four who didn't claim to be Superman, The Metropolis Kid, The Last Son of Krypton, and The Man of Tomorrow--Cyborg Superman. Superman: Doomsday did not contain any of these characters, though the Luthor made Superman clone did embody some of their traits.

2817192,2,B000PE0G0A,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Superman Doomsday is the first film in the DC direct-to-video lineup. Superman Doomsday, to be honest, is one big missed opportunity. The Death of Superman in the comics is one of my favorite Superman stories. This movie just felt very phoned in. The action is alright, but the story is where this movie falls apart in.

The story begins with Doomsday breaking out of a facility underground and goes on a rampage until he reaches Metropolis. Superman fights Doomsday and ultimately ""dies."" Sometime afterwords Lex Luthor has cloned Superman to do his bidding. The clone, however, turns out to be defective and before long aims to rule Metropolis with an iron fist. Superman then returns and stops him.

The main reason why this film did not work is its length. The Death of Superman story is an arc that spans not just Superman's death but also the aftermath of his death. After Superman dies by the hands of Doomsday four Superman impersonators come to take his place; Steel, Eradicator, Superboy, and Cyborg. That is too much material to fit into an hour and fifteen minute movie. This film should have been separated into to movies like The Dark Knight Returns was. However they try to cram everything into one film and it does not really work. Instead of the four Supermen we get a generic defective Superman clone, which is not that interesting. Plus the middle portion of the film got very boring with many unnecessary scenes they could have cut out.

The characters are okay, but some of the casting choices I do not agree with. Adam Baldwin does alright as Superman. However, I would much rather have Tim Daly come back to voice Superman, especially since this Superman looks a lot like Superman in the animated series. Anne Heche is a bad Lois Lane. Her accent did not work at all. She is probably the worst Lois Lane that I have seen. James Marsters as Lex was okay, but not nearly as good as Clancy Brown. The other voices were okay, but nothing spectacular. The voice-acting overall ranged from okay to bad.

The action was great and fun. The animation is also quite good. I would say that the animation was on par if not better than Justice League. The music is also very nice. The action and animation are easily the best aspects of the movie. However the action scenes are few and far between. We have one big action scene at the beginning and one at the end, but the middle was quite boring.

Overall Superman Doomsday is ultimately a lackluster start to the DC animated lineup. Thankfully most of the films following this were improvements to this. I do recommend you by the DVD if you come across for one reason. There is this great minute documentary called Requiem and Rebirth Superman Lives. It is a very informative documentary on the Death of Superman. If nothing else pick up the movie just for that.",1370476800,,2866,4.654150197628459

2817204,2,B000PE0G0A,"There are so many plot holes and gaps in logic that this cartoon was made unenjoyable for the most part.  Take this cliched scenario as an analogy - in a scary movie, a psychopath is murdering teenagers.  A group of teenagers see the murderer enter a house, know that he's in there, but instead of leaving and seeking help, they decide to go inside to ""make sure"" he's in there (or they go inside to ""save"" a badly injured friend, etc.)  In real life, any sane person would go across the street and get the neighbors to call the police.  Or they would pick up a weapon while seeking an alternate route.  Or hop in the fully-serviced car and drive away.  But in this cliche, the teenagers always go in with a ""reason"" that's not very well reasoned-out.  This lack of validity for a plot advancement usually takes a viewer out of the movie.

The same thing holds true for a lot of comics and cartoons.  When this much production value is thrown into a cartoon, you'd expect that the studio would get a seasoned writer to work on the script.  Unfortunately for this Superman/Doomsday cartoon, they elected to forgo a good script writer.

Here's a small spoiler to provide an example.  When Superman first encounters Doomsday, he successfully stops him with his freeze-breath.  Although it only stops him for several seconds, one could imagine what a 30-minute freeze-breath blast would buy in time for Superman.  With Doomsday frozen for a few minutes, Superman would have enough time to fly him out into space and hurl him into the sun (or into the vast void of space).  Since Doomsday shows no sign of the power/possession of flight, it would take a long time, if ever, for him to make it back to Earth.  But instead, Superman goes into a long-winded bout of fisticuffs, even after Superman realizes that Doomsday is stronger than him.  And even after a long beating, he doesn't try his tried-and-true method of freeze-breath.

Why?

Dunno.

2817209,2,B000PE0G0A,"This film was complete rubbish. I am a huge DC comics fan and a, not a particularly tough critic of these animated films/shows. But this was just horrible.

First, it did nothing to honour the story it was based on but I could almost forget that if it hadn't been so bad in so many other areas.

First of all I was really disappointed who this was so different style wise from the other Superman and Justice League animated shows of recent years. I have no idea why  the producers of these one-off films feel that they have to reinvent the wheel. They did the same thing with the recent Wonder Woman film. They introduce a new look, style and voices when its not necessary. The Superman and Lois Lane from the shows in the 90's would have been great in this but instead they ruin it.

Even the new Lex was horrible. He came across as some whiny, spoiled loser. And just randomly he kills his most trusted partner for no reason. WTH?

My next issue is why in these one-off films do they act as if there are no other super heroes? It would have been so much more powerful if Doomsday had beat the stuffing out of some other heroes before Supes got there. Also, having them at the funeral would have been great and showing them fail to keep law and order in the aftermath would also have added to the film.

Now the most annoying and out of character award goes to Lois Lane. In this film they made her out to be a selfish, idiotic, spoiled, dumb jerk. You are supposed to feel sorry for her when Supes dies but she has been so horrible up to then you really can't. She was so annoying and at times you are thinking she has it coming when she gets hurt!

Jimmy Olsen also is completely out of character. It just makes no sense how he acts. Dumb.

And that's pretty much the whole film. Its switches from emotionless to annoying. You don't get behind anyone and you really don't care. This was the first of the post 90's DC cartoons that I actually watched the time for when it would be over. You just didn't care about what was going on.

The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that as films go there are a lot worse even though this film about Superman is just horrible its still better than some of the stuff passing as films these days.

I think if you are not a huge DC fan and don't have a understanding of the DC animated stuff starting in the 90's you might like this film. However, if you are a DC fan forget it.",1354924800,,2434,4.19271948608137

Never before in any of the other Superman animated movie has Superman met an enemy quite like this.

I think that ever Darkseid would have a problem with something like the creature called DOOMSDAY.

This movie differs from many of the other Superman movies in 2 aspects.

1. There is much more sexual innuendo in this movie between Superman & Lois Lane.

in the Fortress of Solitude, first we see Lois, who apparently had just gotten done with a shower, coming towards Superman, wearing nothing more than a towel , & then when she states that she wished that they didn't have to come to such a cold place, to get away, Superman states that the Arctic is a much more secure place to disguise Kryptonian energy sources, Lois says-""You wouldn't use you heat vision on me, would you Superman?"" To which Superman says-""No, just my X-Ray Vision!""

Then there is the seen when we see Lois & Superman on a bed, both dressed in bathrobes, holding each other, (& it's not hard to guess what had been taking place beforehand).

And then, at the end of the movie, in Lois' apartment, we see Lois on the computer, & Superman comes out the bathroom, after having take a shower, with nothing but a towel around his waist!

2. The violence in this movie is much more intense, than in many of the other Superman movies.

Superman takes a horrific beating at the hands of Doomsday, and ends up massively bruised & bleeding.

Also, we see how uncaring Lex Luthor is to his assistant Mercy Graves.

Many people familiar with Lex, know that Mercy has been his personal assistant & confidant for what seems like ages. After Lex gets assurances from Mercy that there would be no evidence of LexCorps involvement in Doomsday's appearance, he calmly takes out a gun, & puts a bullet through her head!

When I saw this, my jaw fell right to the floor! I knew Lex didn't have much humanity in him, but this was absolutely ruthless!

Also, the style of animation is a little different, that we have seen.

it is much more ""stylized"", & designed to ""imply"" human features, rather than actually draw them.

This is certainly NOT a movie for pre-teen viewer because of the physical violence & sexual innuendos.

But it certainly stands out, as one of the most exciting of all the animated Superman movies!",1340755200,,2292,4.608374384236453
2817216,5,B000PE0G0A,"When a team of workmen drilling for LexCorp release the creature of destruction known as Doomsday, Superman is the only one who can stop him, but possibly at the cost of his own life. After the violent battle, Superman's friends, family, enemies, and truly the whole world have to learn to live without the Man of Steel. Until, from out of nowhere, he appears to be back! But, this resurrected Superman seems to be acting rather strangely...

I'm not totally sure why ""Superman: Doomsday"" is considered the first in the line of DC animated direct-to-video movies. There WERE a few before it for Batman and Superman, but regardless, this film was a great ""start"" to a fantastic line of films. I wish Disney had paid some attention to what W.B. did here and used their direct to video animation department for feature films based on their classic 80's and 90's Disney Afternoon cartoons instead of sequels to their animated classics, so the products would be an upgrade from the source material rather than a downgrade. But, I digress. ""Superman: Doomsday"" is an excellent film about, more than anything, the importance of Superman to the people in his world. Directed by Bruce Timm and co., this film was supposed to be trying to look and feel very different from Timm's fantastic TV series universe, but honestly, it only seems different due to the story having its own cannon and the characters having different designs. However, they all still look like Timm creations, so what I mean by saying it is not very different is that everyone here looks and acts very much like they could be from that same universe, even if Lex doesn't look like the TV Lex and Superman doesn't look precisely like the TV Superman. Lois looks quite different. Hard to say which version I find more attractive visually (neither Loises have really been my type in voice and personality), but again, I digress. I'd say everything comes off as well done and well performed as on those great TV shows, only here things get a bit more violent and sometimes a bit more sexy. Naturally, the sex stuff is just implied, while we do see people getting bloodied and killed full on, ha. Lex is pretty great in this, though I don't love his design as much. As with all these films, sometimes you have some corny lines, maybe sometimes it's the delivery of the lines, I don't know, usually from extras like Lex's hammy workmen or when characters are trying to be sexy, but like I said, overall, this is a lot like the Bruce Timm/Paul Dini TV shows, which, of course, is a very good thing and what many of us wanted more of (I will never have enough of Timm's D.C. stuff). Something to note though, is that each of these direct to video films is supposed to take place in its own... I'll use the term ""universe"" again. As in, none of them are supposed to be connected to the TV show or be a direct sequel to another one, though I'm not sure if that rule has been broken since things first started out with this film (I'm a wee bit behind on these lately).

If you're a fan of the DC Universe, especially the Bruce Timm animated stuff, I highly recommend this film and the whole line of D.C. direct-to-video animated features. Most always seem to outdo the previous films or at least equal them, from the ones I've seen at least. I also find these to be far superior to the Marvel direct-to-video animated features that started up around the same time. Those are still worth checking out, but it seems that usually Marvel shines in live-action while D.C. shines in animation (yeah, Dark Knight is amazing, but that's one phase of one franchise). The Blu-Ray for ""Superman: Doomsday"" is quite good, with a ton of excellent bonus features. There are a handful of documentaries about the comics and the making of the film, four select episodes from Superman the Animated Series (Mxyzpixilated, which is a fave of mine, Brave New Metropolis, and Apokolips...Now! Parts 1 and 2, all are great), and, besides some trailers for other animated features, a rather fun commentary featuring the directors and other crew members is also included. Like I said, this is a great start to a great line of films that is still going (and that I need to catch up with). It is NOT directly based on any of the comics, though it does borrow from the famous Death of Superman saga.

2817221,5,B000PE0G0A,"Unlike most fan boys with a mean streak, I was not anticipating a comic creation like this. I don't fantasize about the fall of child hood demigods. I for one thought Michael Jackson's brain would be kept alive in a lab until the year 20 blot - Zero and I took no pleasure when the Crocodile Hunter met his demise by stinger and not by a pair of gigantic crushing jaws. So, neither was I wanting Super Man to die at the hands of an INTER GALACTIC SOCCER HOOLIGAN!

However, if it HAD to happen, I'm sure select fans had their blood lust satiated by the comics and movie; It was at least done elegantly and thoughtfully...in a way that did not gross out the fans who never wanted this, but were drawn because this is a milestone in Super Man's history.

I thought it was very well set up from the beginning as we were reminded of Superman's quirks by visiting the Crystal Fortress and reminded of his Earth ties by being reintroduced to Jimmy, Martha, and Lois. I especially like Martha...she is played for very dry humor here and it works.

And who's death isn't ten times more heart breaking when their mother and girlfriend have to watch it on TV? Heck, Lois was there (sniffle) - talk about dark and it goes on to be even darker as we see Lex's shocking reaction to the death of his long time rival. I won't spoil it, but I was appalled. I never would have put Lex in the same twisted and demented category as I do the Bat Man villains, but Lex earns his place there this time. He's a sick man.

Well, things snowball out of control and then get crazier from there. By the third act of this movie, I was questioning the Super Man mythos as I know it, which it is very rare that a Holly Wood production of a character can pull that off, let alone an animated production.

They wrapped it up neatly near the end, but I was still left wondering that if these things can happen....nothing will ever be the same in this/that/whichever world. I might also add that if you've ever wondered what a Super Man played by Jeff Goldblum circa 80's glam rocker version would be like, there is one flying around here that just tickled me pink.

2817229,4,B000PE0G0A,"Starting off their ongoing series of made-for-video features for DC Universe, Warner Premiere decided to go with a darker chapter from the Man Of Steel's history that was mostly overlooked in any of his previous animated adaptations. Based on the Death Of Superman, Funeral For A Friend, and Reign Of The Supermen story arcs from the various comic books, this was directed by previous DC superhero animation writer Bruce Timm, along with Batman: The Animated Series writer Duane Capizzi. Even though it was done as its own movie, it shadows some story elements from Superman: The Animated Series.

This takes place during a time when Lex Luthor is still in charge of Lexcorp, and Superman has recently been dating Lois, although he hasn't told her his secret identity yet, despite her suspicions. While digging underground for a new power source, Luthor's crew discovers an ancient spacepod housing a hulking alien monster. The creature(Doomsday)goes on a rampage through Metropolis, and Supes enages with him in a slugfest the likes of which Goku wouldn't have survived. Their clash knocks over building after building, which suprisingly no one was in at the time, but ultimately both the super-strong aliens die from the fight. Superman is buried in an elaborately huge memorial in the middle of Metropolis park, although apparently all the JLA members were too busy trying to get their own DC Universe movies made to bother to showing up at his funeral. Lois is bereaved, and goes to Martha Kent in Smallville for someone to talk to. Jimmy Olsen quits the Daily Planet to work for a tabloid rag, and Perry White give in to whisky. Villains on the other hand have been having a crime orgy in Metropolis, and staple crazy genius Toyman kidnaps a bus full of kids. Fortunately, they are rescued by a supposedly resurrected Superman! This revived Man of Tomorrow is really a clone created by Luthor, who now holds the corpse of the original in Lexcorp. However, Superman's faithful robot manages to get it back with no detection, and brings him back to the Fortress of Solitude where its revealed that Superman wasn't really dead at all, but in a biological stasis. He is revived, only to find out that his evil twin has killed Toyman, and just taken out Luthor, along with all the other soulless Superman clones. Even though he's only at partial power, Superman puts on a solar-collecting gothic jumpsuit along with a kryptonite gun, and flies to confront Superman-B. The two of them butt heads, wrecking a good part of the freshly-regenerated city with them. Superman-A takes out Superman-B with some leftover Krytonite dust, and everyone welcomes the ""real"" Superman back(despite the fact that he just freakin' killed a guy!).

This story is something that's been adapted several times since its comic book run. In a radio drama, a novelization, and a killer video game. Although like most of them, the movie takes and leaves alot of material not used in the original. This includes Luthor's whole rebirth thing where he actually has a full head of hair, no Supergirl, and pretty much none of the actual four Supermen who showed up after Super died. The evil clone is sorta based on the idea of the Superboy clone, but gone all bent after being abused by Luthor. Also, Lois was already married to Clark and knew his secret identity prior to Doomsday ruining their honeymoon. In most of the original DC animated continuity, Doomsday only fought the actual Superman once and got his ass kicked, but this movie managed to pull off a real all-out bout to end the doubt. The rest of the story after Superman kicks the bucket is fair, at least with everyone grieving over the loss, plus Luthor totally loosing it by beating the crap out his clone with Kryptonite gloves because he didn't get the chance to kill Supes himself. For the first DC Universe movie, this did feature some impressive animation over that of their usual TV stock, and was totally a better movie than the crappy Superman: Brainiac Attacks debacle. The voice acting is fair too, even though it doesn't feature any of the TV series actors. All in all, I'd recommend this for the serious Superfans, or anyone sick of waiting for Superman to have someone he can actually fight in his new movies.",1297382400,,4259,4.840877914951989
2817230,3,B000PE0G0A,"The Death of Superman storyline is what got me back into the Superman comics in the early 90's, and I remained a fan until the early 00's when the change of art direction and the insane plotting pretty much killed it for me again.  Still, I was quite interested in seeing what they would do with this and the result is a mixed blessing.

First, I wasn't a fan that Lois was hooking up with Superman, but not Clark (even though she strongly suspects they are the same anyway).  What made the comics so great in the Byrne era was the Superman was CLark's alternate identity and not vice versa.

I also wasn't too crazy about the resolution of the storyline where they essentially mixed the Eradicator part of the Reign of Supermen with the KnightsEnd story from the Batman.

What did work in the movie?  I liked Jimmy Olsen's character, who was pretty much following the same arc of the comics in the mid 90's.  I also liked Marster's portrayal of Luthor.  Although a bit cliched, the fake Superman was done pretty well also.  But what really made the movie itself worth watching were the two major fight sequences, both of which were suitably epic.

Finally, the DVD itself is worth getting for the 45 minute documentary of the original Death of Superman, which was a great reminder of just how good that storyline was, and how much it helped rebuild DC comics in the early 90's.  There was also a passable, but brief, segment with the voice actors, although Marsters' portrayal of Luthor was left off for some reason.

All in all, a pretty decent portrayal, even if it couldn't come anywhere near what they did in the comics.",1290902400,3,1625,4.546391752577319
2817231,2,B000PE0G0A,"Choppy Animation, revised story from the orginal comic and an overall cheap feel. The Death of Superman was a comic Classic with all types of plot twist. This is a let down in a major way.",1290643200,3,188,4.25
2817232,3,B000PE0G0A,"There was a brief time in my life when I collected comics on a semi-regular basis.  It was a very short period of just about a year that ended when DC announced that Superman would be killed.
The creature that brought about the ultimate battle was a completely nihilistic character named Doomsday a creature that couldn't be killed and could only ""feel"" hate.  The comic where Superman died sold more comics in one day than any other comic book in history had done up to that point.  Of course, the whole story line also was a major factor in the eventual demise of much of the comic book industry, something the industry has only started to recover from in the past few years.

SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY is a direct-to-DVD title that attempts to compress the entire Death of Superman saga into a simple, easy-to-follow storyline that runs for a bit less than 90 minutes.  The movie follows the very basics of the Death of Superman saga: Doomsday's ""discovery"" below the Earth, the fight between Superman and Doomsday in Metropolis, and (of course) the death of Superman. However, there's a large chunk of the Death of Superman story that has been exercised from this movie. For instance, there's no eradication of the Justice League, no Reign of the Supermen, etc.

Direct-to-DVD animated titles tend to not have as quality animation as theatrical releases.  However, this wasn't a typical direct-to-DVD.  It was heavily marketed and promoted and I can't help but feel some of that marketing money would have been better spent in getting better quality animation.  In my opinion, it most closely resembles the animation of the Superman cartoon shorts of the 1930s and 1940s.

SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY isn't a terrible animated movie. However, it's not great either.  Comic book purists probably won't like the film and though the movie has a larger appeal than many other titles, there aren't a lot of people who aren't already familiar with Superman that are going to watch this movie.",1283644800,,1972,4.874251497005988

I know it would take alot of time, money & effort, but I'm sure the die-hard fans would greatly appreciate the final product, provided it was completed truthfully with the source material.
Secondly, the most recent reviewer stated that this is not for young children! That is quite correct & is aimed at the higher age bracket &deserves the MPAA rating of PG-13! Touted to be the first animated PG-13 Superman adventure & deservingly it should be! This was a violent & graphic storyline when it was initially published. I should know since I have the entire run of that storyline, Doomsday, The Death of Superman, Funeral For A Friend & then ultimately, The Reign of the Supermen! Great gripping reading & the artwork fantastic & graphic! Definitely not for young children!
This dvd is a condensed version of the above-mentioned story arcs with the ultimate return of the Man of Steel!
I will say that I sorely  diappointed with the runtime & abbreviated connected storylines to this great DC Comics event, which took it's place in the Media when it was announced to the world with a banner healine ""Superman Is Dead""! Did that get coverage not since the JFK assassination according to many persons.

2817234,1,B000PE0G0A,"I know this is not a comic book, so I won't review it based on a comic book reader's perspective. Based solely as a ""movie"" even for an animated one, its simply terrible. It seemed like the director/ writers couldn't make up ther collective minds to make a kid's film, or for young-adults, and the end result was a bad attempt at both, while accomplishing to satisfy none.

For example, there were sexual innuendos in the dialogue that just wasn't appropriate for children. However, the overall story is just way too simple to satisfy a more mature audience (the fight scene between Superman and Doomsday took up basically two thirds of the movie). For what is supposed to be ""The Death Of Superman,"" one never quite feels the tension. Worse, how Superman comes back from the ""dead"" was not very creative at all. The explanation was just way too convenient.

I find it hard to describe this as a ""movie."" First, it looked nothing different from the regular animated series on tv, except the awkward need to add cheeckbones to the characters' faces. The same lazy animation of boxy faces and figures are still there. Secondly, it just doesn't feel like a movie. It felt more like an extended regular episode.

Overall, Superman: Doomsday is a monumental waste of time. It's simply nothing more than a movie studio's excuse to sell something... anything.",1280966400,2,1352,4.793991416309013
2817235,4,B000PE0G0A,"And that very thing happens in Superman: Doomsday, the first in a line of DC Universe Animated Original Movies. With Batman: Under The Red Hood on its way to home video Tuesday, I'm looking back at the previous seven DCU films.

Based on The Death of Superman storyline of the early '90s, this first entry feels a little rushed. The story flows very well but I can't help but feeling that Bruce Timm could've made it longer. There is no written rule that Direct to Video movies must be seventy five minutes or less (evident when they get to Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. I can understand consolidating the Superman impersonators into the clone but the other DC heroes should've made an appearance at the funeral as they did in the comic. Though the way Superman finishes off Doomsday in the movie is far more effective than how it was done in the comic (they just fight til they die). I really think they should've held off of this particular adaptation for awhile, seeing as how they had already done a ""Death of Superman"" two-part episode in Justice League and had incorporated Doomsday into that show as well (though his threat is not as big compared to this movie) so we're treated to almost the same exact story. Also the updating of the story to present times, what with Clark going to Afghanistan, is superfluous and unnecessary, they could've left the story in the nineties.

The animation is great (it's Bruce Timm, what else do you expect) but my main gripe is the actual character models. They are clearly based on the animated series models but with slight alterations (such as those stupid lines on Superman's face and the fact that Lex's face looks like it might be a mask). Some were radically different than their original counterparts, such as Mercy Graves (but it looks like she hasn't got a nose in many shots except a side shot of her looking at Luthor) and Toyman yet his original animated series counterpart is far more disturbing and psychotic.

The voice casting is alright (Andrea Romano has never failed us yet) but in my opinion, they could've done better. Adam Baldwin is good at Superman/Clark Kent but not as memorable as Tim Daly or George Newbern. Some deliveries feel flat and boring but he does deliver in the end. Anne Heche is good as well but again, not as memorable as Dana Delany. Heche doesn't have the spunk that her predecessor had but when the scene between her and Martha proves that she is worthy in the role. James Marsters gives Clancy Brown a run for his money. His Lex is psychotic and he seems to have a need to have Superman around, for without him, Lex has no purpose to show off his genius. The other cast members I'll give my quick opinion on; Ray Wise is great as Perry White but his scenes are too short to get an impact. Adam Wylie just furthers my dislike of Jimmy Olsen, he comes off as a jerk when he leaves the Daily Planet and even when he joins Lois, its too late for me to really care if he returned or not. John DiMaggio is funny as the new punk Toyman, a shame that his appearances are too brief. Tom Kenny is good as the Robot, having him inflect a subtle humor and proves that Kenny isn't always annoying in the characters he voices. And lastly is Swoosie Kurtz and Cree Summer; Summer puts on her usual voice that makes her recognizable but that's also a bad thing. Her voice is too recognizable from what she uses in her other work that she doesn't make Mercy her own when compared to Superman: TAS. Swoosie Kurtz is featured briefly but she did a good job with Martha, making her feel emotionally vulnerable after the death of her son and her bonding with Lois.

Not a bad start to these line of movies but to add swearing and more violence should not be the reason to make these PG-13. The story must feel more mature and the extra violence and swearing should come naturally from it. This clearly could've been at least PG.",1279929600,,3899,4.510608203677511
2817236,3,B000PE0G0A,"This was a decent adaptation of a famous graphic novel series.  The film cuts out a lot of the convoluted and unnecessary bits from the comics, but it also misses some of the best parts.  For example, the movie leaves out when Doomsday ferociously tears apart the entire Justice League, leaving Superman the only hero standing.  Superman is not the only guy around, but the only one with the strength and will to stop Doomsday.  Without Doomsday vs the entire League, we're unable to witness the contrast.  The comics also featured the entire Justice League mourning the death of Superman.  Without these heroes fighting Doomsday or mourning Superman's death, the film simply cannot provide an emotionally resonant funeral.  Sorry Jimmy Olsen, but your tears just don't compare to Batman's tears.

I didn't mind that they basically boiled down all 4 of the ""Supermen"" into one character, but it could have been handled better.  Perhaps if the returning Superman was Cyborg, it would have presented a stronger antagonist.  The end fight is pretty good though, I really enjoyed that.

The animation overall is decent.  Quite similar to the Justice League style if you're familiar with that.  However, some of the changes to the faces of the characters are rather distracting and quite frankly, ugly.

My real beef with the film is the story.  It seems very disjointed.  I have no problem with them not sticking to what happened in the comics very closely, but what they replace it with is far far worse.  After the first act (which is the best act, containing the fight with Doomsday which is fantastic) I quickly lost interest and wanted to turn it off.  I held out hoping the last act would redeem the film, it doesn't in any way.",1275696000,2,812,4.4324324324324325
2817238,3,B000PE0G0A,"My favorite comic book storyline ever has to be ""The Death and Return of Superman Trilogy,"" so when DC announced they were going to adapt the story into their first Direct to DVD feature, I was optimistic. The reality is, it never had a real chance at being an accurate representation of The Death and Return of Superman, it would take an entire 26 episode season of Justice League to present the story correctly, there's no way a 72-minute DVD was going to do it justice. The end result is an overall forgettable Superman experience.

The main feature itself isn't bad, it's just incredibly average. As they point out in the commentary, this isn't much different than what they could get away with on Justice League. They made a great rendition of Superman's initial battle with Doomsday, but the real heart of the Death and Return of Superman Trilogy is really boiled down. What made the original story so remarkable was the impact Superman's death had on the world around him, other superheroes, and his closest friends and family. Here, we just get Lois and Jimmy. So, it's very quick, and that takes the weight from the story. In the source material, it feels like Superman is dead for three months, the movie makes it seem like he was dead for three days.

Let me be clear, it's still a decent narrative, despite not measuring up to the graphic novel. The animation is very similar to the normal Bruce Timm style, all except for Superman's distracting cheekbones, and the fight with Doomsday looks great.

So, it's only a 3 out of 5.

But, you know what makes it really worth owning? (At least for guys like me.) This contains a special documentary called, ""Requiem and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" a behind the scenes look at the creation of the original Death and Return of Superman Trilogy. It's great, I've watched it more times than I've watched the movie.

So, if you're looking for a superhero fix, this one's worth a rent. For those of us that liked the graphic novel, then the Documentary is worth watching at least once.",1272240000,,2033,4.667597765363128

Just like a few of the other reviews said, all of the side stories were left out and the way Superman came back seemed rather 'cheap and easy'.

I understand that this is a straight to DVD animated movie but the battle of Superman and Doomsday alone was a 3 to 4 hr movie in itself.  This would include how Doomsday dismantled every superhero that even made an attempt to stop him.  The final fight between Doomsday and Superman deserved a lot more detail and length than what this DVD provided.  This should have been part 1 to this series, left with the title that it already has.

Part II was a huge story line as well w/ the new Supermen that came about to take the place of the original, all having extremely significant character flaws that proved them to not even come close to governing Metropolis the way Kal El had.  This movie should have gone through some of their confrontations as a set up for the real Superman's return..and this would need to be explained as closely to the comic as possible to give it authenticity and credibility.

Which was a huge let down considering how indepth it was.

2817243,3,B000PE0G0A,"As the makers of this film said in the audio commentary, they presented a more ""mature"" story than could be found in the 90's animated series and the follow ""Justice League"" show.  Perhaps, upping the violent quotient was their intent and they did that in grand style during the introduction of Doomsday - he brutally disposes of all of Lex Luthor's excavation crew - and the subsequent fight with Supes.

The fight is much too gruesome for younger kids; thus, no doubt the PG-13 rating.  Even the fight between Superman and his clone goes on for way too long and almost lays waist the city of Metropolis.  The unexpected murder mid-way through the film is also graphic and surprising.

Adam Baldwin does a fine job as Clark Kent/Superman but Anne Heche is no Dana Delaney as ""Lois Lane"".

After being accustomed to hearing the magnificent bass of Clancy Brown as ""Lex Luthor"" throughout the Superman animated series and Justice League, James Marsters just doesn't quite cut it in the role.

The confrontation between Doomsday and Superman is a bit of a letdown but the second half of the film makes up for it.  The clone of Superman has an interesting philosophy, seeming somewhat of a flip-side of the last son of Krypton.

The DVD gets three stars because of the more engaging second half of the film as well as a fascinating bonus: a refresher on the actual ""Death of Superman"" comics storyline from the 90's on which the film is loosely based.",1253059200,,1448,4.691699604743083

I read through the people who gave it one star and I got to say, what is the problem? You want an exact duplication of the Doomsday story line? Worse yet, you want to cram in his death and the subsequent revival? How long do you want the movie to be? Let comics be comics and cartoons be cartoons. I really enjoyed what they did with Gotham Knight and I kind of wish they had done the same with Doomsday- but it is what it is. For those of us who grew up on Batman and Superman adventures and Justice League this movie is very enjoyable. Why in the name of buddha they decided to go with different voices is beyond me, half ass star power brought in zero increased revenue for WB and hopefully they realized it.

2817249,4,B000PE0G0A,"MAJOR SPOILERS INCLUDED:

There were things done well in the original Death of Superman comic storyline and things done not so well. The Doomsday plot started off innocently enough but after a lengthy buildup exploded into a fevered climax. Doomsday's true form was only revealed after repeated encounters with Earths heroes shredded his suit and I liked the way he literally fought with one hand tied behind his back for much of the story. Doomsday's obliteration of Earths mightiest defenders gave him a tremendous amount of credibility leading up to his finale with Superman. By contrast the animation has no time for building suspense and so Doomsday quickly plows through the military before his inevitable collision with Superman. Rather than have the two combatants deliver simultaneous knockout blows Superman crushes Doomsday to the ground from outer space. Not something I would normally expect to kill Superman. By and large I was never a big fan of the death of Superman storyline and I didn't like that the big guy was taken down by a brand new villain who simply punched him to death. Unfortunately the parts that worked for me had to be removed for brevity's sake. The second half of the comic storyline was the resurrection of Superman but again for the sake of time they removed almost everything including the Cyborg Superman, The Eradicator and John Irons.

The funny thing is that what works in the movie has nothing to do with Doomsday. A new Superman appears in Metropolis who looks and speaks like the original and everyone assumes he has risen from the dead. Instead, the new Superman is a clone created by Lex Luthor similar to the Kon-El storyline from the comics. The excitement of Superman's return is soon dampened after the Toyman kills a 4 year old girl and the clone decides to take care of him... permanently. Later, after the Man of Steel rescues a cat from a tree he gives its elderly owner a stern warning that every time he has to perform a small rescue it takes him away from larger emergencies. Superman's voice remains calm but his words contain a less than subtle threat and the old woman shrinks in fear. Soon all of Metropolis discovers that no one better get in Superman's way while he defends the city. For me this was by far the best part of the movie and played into a theme of freedom and security that was analyzed throughout season two of Justice League Unlimited. There is no indication that the clone sees himself as anything less than a hero which brings some unexpected depth to the character.

Inevitably the true man of tomorrow returns having only been rendered comatose rather than actually killed. With long hair and a black and silver solar suit the real Superman faces off against the clone in a real barn burner. In fact both of the major battles are done well and the animation is well above what is seen in the animated series.

The Doomsday movie exists in a different world than the animated series universe and the characters are given completely different looks and voices. I actually prefer this version of Luthor with a much sleeker appearance and less arrogant voice. Superman on the other hand looks a bit odd with deep creases on either side of his face, a large cleft chin and a neck that looks to be about 30 inches around. Even his costume doesn't look correct being very shiny almost as if it's made of rubber.

The producers of the movie don't hold back on the deaths and Doomsday carves a swath of murder that sometimes borders on gratuitous. In this version Toyman (who looks nothing like the animated series version or any of the comic incarnations) is homicidal and as stated before gets offed by the clone. Even Luthor is more ruthless as he puts a bullet in his longtime assistant Mercy to keep anyone from discovering his link to Doomsday. The second part of the movie is in my opinion better than the first and I have to say that the movie as a whole felt like more than just an extended version of the animated series which differentiates it from the lamentable Brainiac Attacks. It's a superior product with better animation and a plot that is both deeper and more mature than the television show.",1247097600,,4185,4.6961852861035425

After watching it with my kids (who loved it, btw) I can honestly say it's not as bad as many have proclaimed.  First off, I really enjoyed Adam Baldwin as Superman (surprisingly so, since he was the opposite of a ""superman"" in the Firefly series) and James Marsters was brilliant as Lex Luthor.  I will have to admit, though, that Ann Heche was a poor choice for Lois.  I couldn't get her face out of my head from Six Days, Seven Nights, which was quite annoying as I got lost in the actual character when it came to the rest of the cast.

As for the story I agree it would have been nice had the writers focused more on a world without Superman, but as to including storylines dealing with other heroes reactions I can't see how that would be prevalent in a Superman movie.  Had this been a Justice League film I can see where that would be justified, but this wasn't the case.

All-in-all I think this was a solid film with pretty good animation.  My only complaint in this area would be the harsh lines on Supes face.  They made him look rather old.  Bottom line, if you're a casual Superman fan I can't see why you wouldn't want to add this to your collection.  If you're an obsessed comic book type fan, then you might take issue with the liberal take on the story of the death of Superman.",1242432000,,1419,4.277153558052435
2817255,1,B000PE0G0A,"Man, I hate movies based on things.  It's not that all of them are bad.  Batman Begins, for example, managed to be one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and about half of the recent superhero movies released to theaters have surprising been worth a single viewing.  No, I hate movies based on things because there are so many pitfalls for amateur directors, producers and actors to plummet, screaming into as the critics stand calmly above the pit's second level, hurling insults down upon them for their disrespect.  The worst part is that the more popular the subject matter is, the harder it is to appease the fans, half of whom will demand precise, unwavering faithfulness to all that's come before, as the other half whines that the story wasn't more original.  It's little wonder, therefore, that most directors and writers for movies based on other things just won't even bother trying to appease the fan base, and instead, will try to tell a story of their own with someone else's characters, thus effectively digging even larger and more scream-worthy pits for themselves to fall into when they really, really, REALLY get it wrong.

So anyway.  Superman Doomsday.

Here we have a movie that's about, or rather based on...  Alright.  It's very, very, very loosely based on a series of comics books that I think were first released sometime in the ninties, though I honestly can't remember a thing about comic books from the ninties.  Anyway, as my loyal contacts over at wikipedia have been kind enough to inform me, the death and return of Superman was a pretty big event, in which one character; creatively named Doomsday, decides it's a smart idea to go to town and start wrecking up the place.  Action and mayhem follow, and there's a whole mess in which a bunch of new superman-style superheroes appear before being quickly voted off the island when the old Superman returns.  Apparently, Superman Doomsday was intended to be something like that, but whether the old comics were fun to read or not, this film seems to have gotten a bit lost on the way to funsville.

I think I may have been a bit spoiled by the art and storytelling style of the DC-animated universe, but I still don't see why Superman has to have stupid little black lines on his cheeks in every single scene like he's wearing really insufficient war-paint.  It's bad enough they had to dip Lois Lane in chocolate and force Lex Luthor to lose about fifty pounds, but if I were Mister Generic Doom Monster Guy fighting big blue, and I saw those little black ""Y's"" staring me in the face from either side of the big guy's mug, I'd probably bust a gut, which might make them functional at least.

But how did the movie sound, you might ask?  Was the music any good?  How about the voices?  To that, I'd probably reply, ""Oh, I don't know.  Okay, I guess.""  That, of course, being me-speak for ""It couldn't have been anything really good, or I'd remember it, wouldn't I?""

I hate it when people do this.  I don't know who got it into his head first that background music should never distract from the action in the movie.  It's background music.  It's supposed to seize you by the shirt collar and tell you how to feel in any given scene, just like it's done in all the good movies ever released; Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Hook, Spider-man, the first Superman movie with Christopher Reeves...  Bland, uninteresting, generic tunes like the kinds in this movie only serve to further outline how bland, uninteresting and generic the scenes themselves are, and once you realize that, there's not much else I need to say, is there?

The story...  Let's see.  I guess there was probably a story, that...  Oh, yeah.  It started out with Mister Stone Cold Generic breaking loose from some evil monster container somewhere and going after Superman, so they at least got that part right, or at least, as right as you can get a really vague, underdeveloped story concept.  Then, for some reason, the movie decides that it wants Lex Luthor to be responsible for all the evil in the world, so he repeatedly unleashes and/or creates every other major threat in the entire movie, apparently not having learned his lesson from the first time.

There's a couple of brief cartoon fight scenes, some equally-generic plot about a robot Superman, then a clone or some such thing that wants to follow the typical ""protect people by enslaving them with lethal force"" villain motivation textbook, but by that point, I'd stopped caring, and the movie clearly wanted me to care, because so many of the characters seemed to do so directly and loudly.

Subplots are even worse, especially when Jimmy Olsen tries to go punky and rebellious and ends up sliding halfway into disco territory.  It's a seventy-four minute movie, for goodness' sake.  Do we really have time to worry about who Jimmy Olsen is working for this week?

After that, we march, grudgingly, on to the final point on which the movie tripped and feel on its face; the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane.

I have a confession to make.  I hated Superman II.  No, I'm not cowardly.  I'm not one of those people who quivers in fear when Kryptonian criminals invade Earth and take over.  What inspired so much loathing in me were the implications that Superman had allegedly gotten his thing down with Lois without any kind of formal commitment, and this movie is no different in that respect.

I know that in the modern world, you'll be strung up by your bright red underwear for even implying that people should start taking a little responsibility and treating each other right, but are fidelity and honor really such hard things for people to grasp?  Is it so hard to imagine that a blue, alien boy scout who grew up in Kansas would naturally want to be honorable and commit to the person that he probably cares about most in the world well before scurrying under the sheets?  If that's really so hard to fathom, what does that say about our hero?  More importantly, what does it say about the hero concept in general, if we refuse to even conceive of a hero who's smart enough to attach some importance to any part of the mating process?

To say that I found this movie disappointing would be an understatement the size of planet Krypton in its heyday, but maybe I shouldn't be all that surprised.  After releasing so much empty, meaningless crap like that ""the Batman"" animated series, it feels to me like the age of halfway decent DC Comics animation is well over.  If you really must see Superman animated on DVD, there's always the Paul Dini and Bruce Timm animated series, or even the Max and Dave Fleischer cartoons, which; short and minimalistic though they were, were still better and more faithful to the character than this piece of garbage.

So to sum it up, animation; ridiculous and silly.  Sound, meh.  The story is a hopeless, irredeemable mess so mired in nothing's-sacred modernism that it's a wonder Superman can uphold justice at all, and from start to finish, I can't think of anything about this film that might possibly save it from being a overall bad experience, unless you're the kind that likes watching while moviemakers plummet into bottomless pitfalls.",1240790400,3,7218,4.701670644391408
2817256,3,B000PE0G0A,"I was excited to finally see a PG-13 version of the animated Superman but I was somewhat disappointed instead. I'm a huge fan of the Superman Animated Series so I had really high hopes for this but there were too many problems which annoyed me to the point where I almost stopped watching.

First, the voices do not match the characters at all. Superman and Lois sound completely off and lack the punch and energy of the TV series. Anne Heche (who does Lois) is horrible and made Lois sound like she was 50-60 years old. They made Lois look younger but made her sound older? Superman himself also lacks the gravitas and emotion from the TV series. The voice actor sounded like he was asleep at the wheel. I was also disappointed with everyone else as well. Almost everyone was miscast and their performances were terrible. What happened?

The story also felt rushed. The twist in the middle is just lame and considering the title of the movie is Doomsday, I was disappointed that he was dropped so quickly. Why didn't the writers simply follow the story in the comics? They added some really lame plot devices which also felt undeveloped. They even managed to make Lex Luthor uncool! Wow...

So what's good? The animation for the fights are spectacular. It's pretty much the only reason to watch this movie. It's great to see Superman fight two really strong opponents in full force. The animation is silky smooth with great choreography. I also liked that the villains actually killed people. That's something that made the movie's villains more dangerous which was refreshing.

But overall, Superman Doomsday was disappointing. The story was a mess, the characters were not interesting and the voice actors were terribly miscast. Watch it for the fights and animation. That's the only good thing about this movie.",1238803200,2,1815,4.826366559485531

Co-starring the voices of Cree Summer, Tom Kenny, Kevin Smith and Swoosie Kurtz this is a very good and entertaining Superman animated feature. The film is well animated and nicely voiced but not very faithful to the legendary ""Death and Return of Superman"" comics cause there's no DC characters at Superman's funeral or his Cyborg clone or Superboy or Steel. The movie is quite violent for a PG-13 animated feature with some salty language and some innuendos which maybe inappropriate for younger kids but older kids with teens and adult DC fans would enjoy watching this somewhat very good animated feature.

This Blu-Ray special edition offers fantastic crystal picture and perfect sound quality that could rock the boat and some nifty extras like audio commentary, featurettes, interviews and trailers.",1237852800,3,1404,5.047413793103448

The story is AN ADAPTATION of the doomsday saga in comics.  I read it all those years ago, and find the movie very pleasing.

The doomsday part could have been detailed better, and the returned a bit more dramatic than to save us from the evil clone.

Superman's interpretation looked more like a man in his forties, than in his early thirties.

Lois Lane's interpretation looked more like Lana Lang from Superman the Animated series down to the mini skirt.

The movie had a good theme, but a lack of better animation to follow on the steps of SAS, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.

Because of the medium of animation, the creators flexed their muscles and really got into the true evil of Luthor -- ruthless killer with an amazing scientific mind and a megalomanic attitude.  He even gets a shot at Superman!

I saw this film at it's premiere at the San Diego Comicon and the audience loved it.  Definitely pick this one up.  Not really for little kids due to the blood and rutheless fighting and killing.",1235174400,,696,4.564516129032258

I understand that it isn't meant to be simply a visualization of the comic but it still should hold more true to the original story. No Justice League members, Super Girl, or additional superheroes are present. There aren't four new ""Supermans"" like in the comic, only a clone created by Luxor.

Another complaint is the voice talent. Tim Daly, Clancy Brown, and Dana Delany all did amazing voice acting work in Superman: The Animated Series so I expected them to reprise their roles but if not, have sufficient replacements. Neither can be said as their replacements are poor in comparison. Baldwin sounds much more like a whiny Peter Parker than the Man of Steel and Luxor's voice doesn't command the respect and attention Brown's did.

That aside, the action is really cool and the film is well animated. Explosions and lighting are look very awesome and realistic. The Doomsday/Superman battle scenes are very epic and easily the best part of the film.

The 75 minutes are basically split into Superman's battle against Doomsday (both die), the cloning of Superman by Lex Luthor and the ""rebirth"" of Superman, which leads to his fight with the formidable ""Superclone."" There are some nice twists in the plot - with an interesting exploration into revenge, vigilantism and the manipulation of power - and a surprise ending for Superman/Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Lex Luthor.

Adam Baldwin (the voice of Kal-El, Clark Kent, Superman and ""Superclone""), Anne Heche (Lois Lane) and James Masters (Lex Luthor) are outstanding in interpreting their characters.

2817266,4,B000PE0G0A,"The Death and Return of Superman as told via a cartoon movie.
(This review containes some SPOILERS)

First and foremost it should be stated that yes this movie does deveat from the source material in some respects. But you have to remeamber how long the orginal storyline was. the entire thing simply could not all fit into the movie. some sacrifices had to be made as well ajustments.
And I think they did a good job of telling the basic story.

Secondly this is the second direct to DVD Superman story.
the first Brianiac Attacks was just sold to make money because the movie Superman Returns had just come out. Brianiac Attacks was just plain terrible. yes there was some similer animation to the old superman series and some the same voice for superman. but all in all the plot was awful. and the lex luthor was terrible. coming off as some teenager rather then some menacing villain. and don't even get me started on Brianiac himself.

This movie is FAR better then Brianiac Attacks. and frankly its a LOT better then Superman Returns.

one last thing before I go on. this movie may not be suitible for all children. so if ur a parent buying this watch it first. seriously!

moving on...

all the voice actors did a fine job. even Hash did well as lois. Baldwin was an excellent superman. James Marsters went to town on luthor and did a great job even though the charture played a rather minor role.

again the movie has most of the basics of the main story.

it should be stated that this moive is within a different continuty then the early Superman series and the Justice leauge series. its a different story entirly.

in this movie we have superman and lois getting serious. at that same time Doomsday comes up. the movie shortens the fight between Doomsday and Superman but again for a movie its better that way. the fight I might add is rather brutal and bloody.
the actule 'death' of superman is done very well.

here clark is sent away to afganistan while events take place.

the movie does not do a whole lot of 'a world without superman' like the comics did. but i suposes thats better for time constrants.

it at least shows how all the main chartures react to the situation. which is good.

the toyman of this movie is very different. much more seeder but creepy.
speaking of which watchout for the kevin smith cameo!

now . . . again the 'reign of superman' is shortened.
but elements are barrowed.

instead of the cyborg superman there is just the clone superman (just as superboy was a clone)
but any way in this movie the clone is an imperfect version of superman.

he even kills toyman at one point. and again its a shocking scean.
we see toyman fall to his death and hit a car. afterwerds a sheet covers his bleeding body.

menwhile the real superman is back. as in the comics he has long hair and a solar suit. he faces his imperfect clone in a finel fight to the finish.

the movie then neatly wraps up the storyline.

its all a fairly decent adaptation of the death and return of superman.
simplistic in story line but good.
and its willing to push a few boundies as well.
there are some rather shocking, creepy, and suprising sceans in this movie.

but its all worth it.

i very much enjoyed this movie.
and would defitly recommend it to others.",1231977600,2,3272,4.474747474747475
2817267,4,B000PE0G0A,"If you buy this DVD hoping that it will be an exact animation representation of the events that unfolded in the pages of DC comics, you might be disappointed. In a way it's sort of like the ""Classic Ilustrated"" version- There is Superman, and there is Doomsday and they do fight and Superman is killed and he does return. This DVD diverges greatly from the Comic story, but if you are open to accepting it for what it is - you might like it. I bought it hoping to see an animated representation of the comic book. Sure, I've played the story in my head a hundred times - in my imagination I've heard the sound of the clash between the man of Steel and Doomsday. In my imagination I've felt the earth shake as buildings fell - I wanted to see it in animation.  That was there in this DVD, but there were no Justice League members helping out and no reign of the Supermen.  There were some twists thrown in the were never in the comics.  At first I was a little disappointed - then I simply settled in to watch it for what it was - and it WAS something I liked - but it was in many ways the ""classic illustrated"" version of a much greater story. You can read the ""classics illustrated"" version of ""White Fang"" and get the gist of the story, but the actual book beats the CI version any day. The actual comic depiction is much better than this DVD, but this DVD was enjoyable to me for exactly what it was - a chance to watch Doomsday come to life and slug it out with the man of Steel. It was worth the price of admission and I've been reading comics since before anyone ever heard of the Fantastic Four, the Avengers or The mighty Thor (all of my favorites)",1231545600,2,1656,4.184952978056426
2817268,2,B000PE0G0A,"I've been a comic book geek for what feels like forever.  Some of my earliest memories are of being taken out to the local magazine store by my father and just pouring over all the different worlds there was that I could immerse myself in.  In my collecting career, there were probably three moments that I'd consider real highlights.  The first was the 'Knightfall' storyline when Bane broke Batman's back, the second was the 'Dark Phoenix' saga in the Marvel universe, and finally there was the 'Death of Superman.'  Needless to say, when I found out a 'Superman-Doomsday' DVD was being developed; the nerd in me was doing cartwheels.  I'm sorry to say that after seeing the finished product, I was left pretty let down.

I'll start with the animation itself.  It's obvious that Bruce Timm's fingerprints were all over this.  That being said, I'm scratching my head over the decision to set this outside the standard continuity of the Superman series that Timm helped to create.  Clark Kent is drawn with these weird facial lines that I suppose was done to make him look a little older.  The problem with this is why you would then de-age everyone else?  Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and the rest of the supporting cast seem to appear younger then they should.  Why wouldn't you just use the same character template that the animated series used?

The voice acting was OK, but the cast had me (again) puzzled.  I don't understand the choice not to bring in the original voice-actors (George Newbern or Tim Daly/ Dana Delany/ Clancy Brown), all of whom had been voicing the same roles for quite awhile now.  Just as an example, I mentioned earlier that Lois Lane looks younger; Ann Heche was then the choice to lend her voice?  Not that Heche didn't do a credible job, it's just that she ""sounds"" about as old as she probably is.  Her voice didn't seem to fit her younger-looking avatar.  Even the relationship between Lois and Superman ""looked"" odd now that they appeared to have such a pronounced age difference.

Reviewers had mentioned this before, but the storyline itself is butchered.  Playing devil's advocate though, I understand a lot of these changes had to be made.  In the comics, this story-arc was massive.  It took a long time to resolve, involved a ton of characters, and happened across (I think) about four or five books.  There's simply too much material to squeeze into an hour and a half and have it make any sense at all.  Having said that, however, as far as I'm aware, this went direct to DVD and was never on any network broadcast; the running time on the film is definitely under eighty minutes.  Timm and company, considering they didn't have to take commercial breaks into account, realistically, probably had about ten extra minutes (at least) that they could have used to add meat to the story.

Speaking of the story, one of the things I enjoyed the most about the comic book version was the sense of scale.  It was jaw-dropping watching Doomsday crash to earth and systematically dismantle the DC universe.  Watching hero after hero fall to him, and watching the Justice League torn apart by him gave Doomsday's power the proper sense of scale.  The comic accomplished two things by the time the showdown between Superman and Doomsday was ready to take place.  The first is, as I mentioned, that you had plenty of time to appreciate just how powerful Doomsday actually is and the second, after the fall of the Justice League, is that it properly portrays Superman as (literally) the 'last line of defense.'  In the animated film, I feel like this sense of scale is completely lost.  Doomsday, in my opinion, just looks like a beast that shows up and got a little lucky.  Taking the Justice League out of the equasion and not seeing the reaction of the rest of the DC universe, seems to rob Superman's death of its significance.

This goes back to my earlier point about the running time, but I don't understand why we saw so little of Doomsday.  I'd venture to guess his time on screen is about a third of the total running time.  Considering the title, I really thought he'd be around longer.  This is more a story of Superman and his clone then Doomsday.

All in all, Superman-Doomsday isn't awful.  It's just that I feel if a couple of decisions were made differently that this could have gone immediately from just `OK' to `Outstanding.' My biggest complaint, and it's a point I know I keep going back to, is that there just doesn't seem to be the proper sense of scale for anything.  If DC chose to recreate one of their premiere story-lines, they did themselves a disservice by not putting it in the proper context.",1228953600,5,4649,4.663390663390663

It is a stand alone movie, and it is dark which is why I recommend it for adults.

I don't read comics very often, but I was familiar with the basic story behind the movie. I really did like the movie, I thought that the action sequences were great, I guess I am too used to Saturday morning cartoons where they don't get to show too much. This movie is definitely for a more mature audience than for little kids, it deserves the PG-13 rating. I only wish that it had been a little longer, even though it was plenty long.
  The extras on the dvd take up more time than I had anticipated. I was pleased that they had a whole hour practically on the back story of the season where they decided to run this story. It was very interesting, and helped the rest of my family better understand what was going on.
  One thing I noticed when I put it in and began watching was that Superman/Kent has really harsh lines on his face that make him look older. When some of my family came in later on in the movie they all asked, ""Why is he so ugly?"" I thought that the rest of the animation was really good besides that though.

2817271,1,B000PE0G0A,"I was truly disappointed with every aspect of this movie.  Before I watched it I was expecting something spectacular and worthy of the name DC Comics/Universe.  Instead, the animation was simple, the acting too rigid and forced, and the storyline too obvious and somewhat embarrassing.

MOVIE CONTENT DISCUSSION BELOW!!

Why was I embarrassed?  Well for starters the ""Eveil Toyman"" was just bizarre and creepy, but not creepy in the ""Wow that character is so creepy that I feel empathy for the victims"" but creepy in a ""I'm really uncomfortable watching this in the company of my friends wondering if they're thinking what I'm thinking and that eerie silence kinda says I'm right.""  The role was totally a strange introduction, plus the actor that played the role reminded me of Andy Circus but without the convincing zealousness.

Then, to have Superman actually ""Die"" at the hands of a ""Monster"" with big ole' teeth and claws for knuckles and mega big was a huge disappointment.  So Superman has tackled every single entity in the universe but a big ole' strong being from another planet that is ancient apparently is too much of a brute for the invincible man from Krypton.  Why didn't the writers spend a little more time really coming up with something that was more convincing like a liquid / gaseous villain that doesn't have the intelligence of right and wrong, just plain eveil with a killer instinct that even Superman has never seen?  Something that could evade Superman in a way besides brute contact?  After watching the ""Extras"" and viewing how proud the writers were about the effort they put forth into the ""Death of Superman"" surely they could have come up with something much better than ""Super Hulk.""  Also, how is Superman serving the good city of Metropolis by having it out ""IN"" the city?  Didn't he just kill a ton of people why he pounded his opponents 911 style?  That above all was the most offensive part of the storyline, the disregard for the fact this superhero just did major damage to his beloved city.  But everyone seems okay with that though, no harm no foul.  It's all good.  WHAH???

Finally my disappointment is rounded off by an animation style that seems so overdone and bland.  ""Oooo wow, a building is exploding.  Oh my look, those two are going to crash into another building that looks like something from the T.V. show.""  Why didn't they step it up a bit?  There has been so many new styles of animation created by innovators who are making a name for themselves in the industry.  Why not take some of their craft and mend it into the movie?

But, the film also is very unenjoyable. It doesn't have the drama of the comic book story nor the characters. In my opinion, what made the ""Death and Life of Superman"" so fun to read was the reactions that the other heroes in the DC Universe had to Doomsday before the final fight and later the ""Funeral for a Friend"" series then the ""Reign of the Supermen"" plot. The Death of Superman rocked the entire DC Universe and that fact is simply ignored in this animated feature. For the DC Animators to do this right, they would have to tell the story in a Justice League Unlimited story and be a 3 parter at the very least!",1226880000,5,768,4.1610738255033555

2817274,5,B000PE0G0A,"I loved the original storyline back in the early '90s comics (yep, I still have the black plastic-sealed copy of the death issue). I also enjoy the Superman animated movies. DOOMSDAY is very well done. I wasn't expecting it to be exactly like the comic books. I knew it would be different, and it is. Better? Worse? No, just different. The epic battle between Big Blue and Doomsday is fierce and catastrophic. Lives are lost, buildings are demolished, and there appears to be no hope. This serves as the mere intro to the bulk of the story, where we get to see just how evil Lex Luthor actually is. Using the basic idea from the Superman resurrection plot, DOOMSDAY gives us a nice, wicked world-domination twist! Who comes up out of that grave? What is it that seems strange about him? Why does he seem to have a new agenda? Can Lois get to the bottom of things before Luthor has his way? Will Metropolis ever have it's true guardian back? Great stuff! Highly recommended...",1226275200,,975,4.577142857142857
2817275,5,B000PE0G0A,"This was a really nice surprise for me.  I watched it not really expecting much of anything, but this is a really exciting and well-written animated movie.  Based loosely upon the ""death of Superman"" issues of the comics, it is a retelling of the Man of Steel's untimely demise following his epic battle with Doomsday.  There are many discrepancies from the comic, particularly Doomsday's origins, and the fight is considerably scaled down, but the fight sequence between them is still spectacular.

I was a bit disappointed at first to find that Doomsday is actually a smaller part of this story than you might think.  However, that disappointment is short-lived, because the rest of the story is fantastic as well.  As you might guess, Superman's death is only temporary and soon he's back in action, but it's quickly apparent that things are not what they seem.

Overall, this is just a really great story, especially considering it's ""only a cartoon"".  I found myself more than once wishing this were live action, because that really would have been amazing.  Still, as it is, this is easily up there with most of the live action superhero movies made recently (and it's WAY better than ""Superman Returns"").  I really like the sort of ""oldschool"" animation, that is, not computer generated.  You don't really see this kind of thing that much these days, which is kind of sad, in my opinion.  This animation style reminds me very much of the cartoons I used to watch as a kid.  However, it should be noted that this is NOT for kids.  With a PG-13 rating, it is considerably darker and more violent than any Superman cartoon I've seen.  Plus, there's a bit of mild language and a more mature and emotionally complex story than what you might expect.

The voiceover work is great as well.  Adam Baldwin has the Superman voice down perfectly, and Anne Heche is a surprisingly good Lois Lane.  James Marsters, who of course plays Brainiac on ""Smallville"", this time provides the voice of Lex Luthor, and his performance is spot-on as well.  Other vocal talents include Ray Wise, Adam Wylie, Cree Summer, and there's even a funny cameo from Kevin Smith.

If there's one thing here that didn't really work for me, it's Superman's goofy robot butler, which was really just cheesy and probably unnecesary.  I guess it did provide some comic relief to an otherwise dark story, but I don't know, I could have done without it.  He was voiced by Tom Kenny, the guy that does Spongebob, so I guess that's kinda cool.

Anyway, I think that for any Superman fan, this is more than worth checking out.  Great action, and a great story.  You can't go wrong.",1226275200,,2643,4.730853391684901
2817276,4,B000PE0G0A,"While in the first 30 mins or so, I wasn't so sure of how the film would be. A simple way of getting things moving is just introducing the Doomsday character, and how he got there. The sequence of Superman and Doomsday fighting was thought out well but at times, feels like its drags on.

But once Superman is dead, the film finally begins to pick up. We see Jimmy, Martha, Lois, and Lex all grieve in their own interesting ways. And one of the things I loved the most about this film is the sick incarnation of Lex, I'd never seen the character like this before. What Lex does as well to help him get through the absence of Superman is so fascinating as well and is one of the stronger elements of the film. Seeing Lois as a Lover of Superman, and Martha as his mother communicating was also very strong.

The humor of the film is very dark, which I wasn't expecting but I loved it. And there are also very dark moments any way which a story like this would need. Even if you've read The trilogy connecting the Death of Superman, watching this film is a completely new experience and will definitely surprise you.",1225670400,5,1114,4.3253588516746415

To start this is NOT the Doomsday of the Comic Book as it would be impossible for them to do so except in a 4 hour movie. This is its own story though quite similar to the comic but takes its own course in a very different direction. Similarly there is a Doomsday though not a tortured son of Krypton, it is an Alien creation. Superman does ""die"" and a replacement appears. Luther is quite the villian and Superman does have some interesting challenges.
  I liked it my wife liked it and the EXTRA BONUS feature is Very Good and as another reviewer wrote Worth the price of the DVD. So I hardily recommend this DVD enjoy but DO NOT expect a video version of the comic book, its not hear and probably never will be. This is its own creature and as I said a good one at that.

2817279,4,B000PE0G0A,"The first in a line of straight to DVD animated features adapted from classic DC stories, Superman: Doomsday re-tells the much maligned Death of Superman saga from the early 90's in animated form, and despite what many of the negative reviews here say otherwise, it works.  The Man of Steel (voiced by Serenity's Adam Baldwin) is in love with Lois Lane (voiced quite stiffly by Anne Heche) and both are enjoying their relationship, until his world is rocked by the arrival of the murderous creature Doomsday, who is inadvertantly let loose by Lex Luthor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James ""Spike"" Marsters).  If you've read the comics, you know what happens next, but the animated feature wisely ignores the Reign of the Supermen part of the arc, in place of an imposter created by Luthor, which results in an apocalyptic showdown.  Being the first in a line of newly animated features, don't go into this expecting something among the lines of the DC animated series' that had come before it.  The animation itself looks similar to what we've seen before (veteran animator Bruce Timm is heavily involved here), but the tone is noticibly different.  The voice acting is solid (Marsters is magnificent as Luthor, while Baldwin is servicable as Superman) and the action is nicely orchestrated as well, all of which makes Superman: Doomsday an animated treat.  This new two-disc edition has a few new features, including episodes from the underrated 90's Superman animated series, but there isn't anything else here that really warrants getting double-dipped for.",1220918400,56,1559,5.0703125

Even in this day and age of a growing number of ""Mature"" viewers who rememeber all of these stories from our youth, do the makers of the movies still think that they are only for kids on Saturday morning? This telling of the demise of argueably the most popular super hero of all time was disappointment and heart breaking because of the typical Saturday morning animation. I think that they should have used some of the animators from Batman: Gothem Nights. With its cutting edge, Japanese animation genious, the 6 stories seemed to flow together seemlessly and made for a much better view than Doomsday. The same could be said for The New Frontier the telling of how the Justice League was founded. I just hope the new Wonder Woman movie is not done in the same manner.",1219536000,,940,4.634730538922156
2817282,5,B000PE0G0A,"It has been 15 years since the release of the ""Death of Superman"" comic books which was one of the coolest storylines to come from DVD comics and also to pump some needed energy into the Superman comic book series.

The storyline featured the intergalactic serial killer known as Doomsday. With super strength, virtually indestructible and the embodiment of evil, not even the Justice League could defeat him. That was until the bloody battle between Superman and Doomsday came to a head and in the end, Doomsday was defeated but Superman sacrificed his life to protect Metropolis and paid for it with his life.

With the release of the DVD of ""SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY"", the first animated Superman movie, is based on the popular battle.

Although the storyline of the animated movie is not exactly the same as the comic book series, the animated film manages to capture the essence of Superman and the bloody battle.

In this film, Superman and Lois Lane have been dating for six months. Lois wants to know more about Superman and she has a hunch that possibly he may be Clark Kent.

While the two are having a romantic vacation, Lex Luthor is still scheming on how to beat Superman and his corporat Lex Corp finds what may be an alien vessel (which turns out to be an imprisonment for whatever is inside). Of course, Lex Luthor authorizes the research team to open the alien vessel and Doomsday is unleashed.

Although the film focuses on the battle between Superman and Doomsday, the storyline goes in much deeper by focusing on the emotions of Lois Lane, Martha Kent and the people close to Superman post-death and that includes Lex Luthor who is so upset that he was not the person to stop Superman and feels cheated.

But all of a sudden when Metropolis needs a hero, a man with the blue tights and red cape is back. But is it really Superman?

So, the storyline is top notch and I wouldn't expect anything less from Bruce Timm, Lauren Montgomery and Brandon Vietti. Bruce Timm has worked on the awesome ""Justice League"" and ""Batman"" animated series and the storyline definitely delivers, thankfully to the cool screenplay by Duane Capizzi.

I must admit that I was not liking Superman's character design, since I was used to the animated series version and got so used to the ""Justice League"" animated series and to see Superman have lines around the cheek bones and a John Travolta style chin...(fortunately, not too Jay Leno) took some time getting used to.

As for the voice acting, Adam Baldwin did a great job as Superman and at first I was not too sure about Anne Heche's voice acting as Lois Lane. It was very different but as the film progressed, I got used to it and I admit, it was kind of unique for her character.

As for special features, the DVD comes with 70 minutes of special features including the ""Documentary and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" which is an informative and awesome look of how the comic book creators came up with the ""Death of Superman"" back in the early 90's. I was impressed that they actually had a lot of video footage from the planning stages to the promotion.  This feature alone is sure to be ""golden"" among Superman fans and readers who followed the ""Death of Superman"" series.

Also featured is a commentary by Bruce Tim and Duane Cappizi, voice director Andrea Romano and executive producer Gregory Noveck.

Also an exclusive sneak peak at DC Universe's ""Justice League: The New Frontier"", ""Behind the Voice"" featurette and ""Superman's Last Stand Challenge"".

I purchased my DVD from Wal-Mart and that comes with a bonus CD which features the actual ""Death of Superman"" comic book.

Although I tend to review mostly Japanese animation, when it comes to certain creators and people behind an animated series or film in the US, I have come to expect quality.

For me, Bruce Timm brings quality to DC characters and ""SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY"" does not disappoint one bit, although loosely based on the comic series of the ""Death of Superman"", the storyline that they came up with for this animated film is still just as emotional and awesome as the storyline that ran in the comic books.

I was among the comic book readers who highly anticipated the comic book release back in 1993, in fact, I bought 4 bagged and 4 regular, the collector's card series and collected the whole run.  That is how hardcore I was into the series.  I loved every issue and admit I was skeptical about the animated film, because I knew that there would be no Doomsday vs. the Justice League, nor will there be the funeral which featured nearly every major super hero from the DC universe, nor the four who tried to take on Superman's legacy.

But I do trust Bruce Timm and he has not disappointed me once with the animated television series, so needless to say, after watching this DVD, I enjoyed every minute of it.

It's interesting because Marvel has released several cool animated films within the past two years but DC's first animated film since the ""Batman"" animated film years ago, with ""SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY"", this release is a grand slam.

Great storyline, awesome special features and featuring one of the most popular heroic icon in American culture, ""SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY"" is indeed a winner.  Highly recommended!",1218153600,,5231,4.7420066152149944

I'd give it 4/5 stars. Though I do not know much about the comics and if they just completely ruined it or not. I know the JL was suppose to appear at Superman's funeral and they weren't there, though. Theirs alot of action in this, and Doomsday doesn't really have much to say in this movie (he literally says nothing.) Though, the marks on Superman's face bugs me, they're pretty unnecessary. I'd say check this film out, give it a shot at least. I'm not even really a big fan of Superman and enjoyed it.",1217808000,,668,4.2265625
2817284,3,B000PE0G0A,"I wonder what's up with DC. The recently released Batman: Gotham Knight, Justice League: New Frontier, and now Superman: Doomsday all seem to push limits and go for a PG-13 rating by adding gore and profanity and a high body count. I guess they're trying to be edgy and attract older viewers, but I think this may put off some fans. I would not let anyone under 12 or 13 watch these movies. Gotham Knight actually pushes an R-rating with its bloodshed.

But at least Gotham Knight had Kevin Conroy from the WB's animated Batman/Batman Beyond/Justice League reprise his role in all six shorts. In this Superman film, on the other hand, all the voices have been recast and the characters are drawn differently, so it barely resembles the superior Superman WB series. Instead of Tim Daly, we get Adam Baldwin as Superman, Anne Heche instead of Dana Delaney as Lois Lane, and James Marsters (who plays Brainiac on the WB's Smallville) as Lex Luthor. Baldwin, Heche, and Marsters do a competent job, but Daly, Delaney, and Brown were much better in these roles. (Powers Boothe was ok as Lex in Superman vs. Brainiac.) Swoozie Kurtz is good as Mrs. Kent, but where is Mr. Kent? In the WB series, he was alive.

This is an entertaining film, with a thrilling battle between Doomsday and Superman at the beginning of the movie, and then another clash between Superman and his dark double at the movie's finale. But it's just not as good as the WB series.

I never actually read the Death of Superman comic, but after watching the documentary extra chronicling the source material, I think maybe the movie would have benefitted hewing closer to the original storyline. I think seeing the four Supermen would have been pretty cool!

I would recommend this movie, despite its flaws, but it could have been better with the original voice cast and without all the violence and hinted at sexuality. Not for little kids, that's for sure.",1216857600,,1922,4.728358208955224

I have a superman t-shirt that I've worn since I was 10 (in the privacy of my own home, don't worry). I've seen all the Superman movies (good and bad), I've read Superman comics, read the entire ""Death of Superman"" series several times, etc, etc. This movie frankly was awful. I didn't time it (and I'm not about to watch it again to find out) but it was basically 60 minutes of battles and 16 minutes of dialogue in the WHOLE MOVIE. There was no plot, no storyline. Anything that did happen (such as Luthor having all those clones) never panned out into a full storyline. Now I understand that to make the Death of Superman series into a full-length live action feature presentation is a dream that will never happen. The story is too complex, the budget would be astronomical and it wouldn't be a movie for the general public's consumption. But there's NO REASON why an animated feature couldn't do more justice to a great storyline like the Death of Superman somewhat more like what occurred in the comic books. Production costs of an animated feature are basically zero (compared to a live action film), and a full treatment of the comic book storyline of Death would have a broad enough appeal to make a great profit for all involved. So how about it?? Let's see the full story of Death, with the Cyborg, the teen clone, John Irons, etc. Someone should do this!!!!

I loved the original story of Doomsday, If you did too you will find this very disappointing.  I expected to be wowed, instead I found myself constantly checking to see how much time was left.",1216166400,,489,4.511363636363637

  Of course it's true that Superman:Doomsday isn't perfect; no movie can satisfy everyone. It does take a pretty blunt view of death and probably shouldn't be watched by little kids (I'd recommend<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Brainiac-Attacks-Original-Movie/dp/B000F0V0LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: Brainiac Attacks - (Original Movie)</a>&nbsp;for them instead), but there is actually very little blood.
  For those remembering the original story from DC Comics, you should be warned that this animated film understandably doesn't quite have the scope of the original graphic tale. It veers drastically as far as essential characters and continuity go, but overall it is complete in itself and well put together.
  And, besides, I liked the ending. There was a measure of closure for all concerned (except Lex Luthor of course; guess you can't keep a good villain down).

It's like going out with a babe and discovering she has butcher cutting hands.  Can Warner Animation please redub her with say Summer Glau?  Hell, I'll even take Kim Delaney or Charo.

But the story was WAY off canon from the original. The action involving Doomsday was over pretty fast (Doomsday was a bit of a wuss actually). In fact, what happens to Doomsday and the whole ""Superman doesn't kill"" thing isn't even addressed. The story was; despite being different from the one written in the comic, one that has been told many times many ways. In fact the whole ""clone of Superman"" thing is getting pretty old.

I don't know why people in entertainment; specifically the movie industry continue to think that they can take an incredibly popular property and ""make it better"" by changing it completely. It's like telling someone they have to try the Bloomin' Onions at your favorite restaurant because everyone who tries them loves them and then making the chef cook your friend onion rings instead. It's similar. It might even be good, but it isn't what you know the people already like; and it might be bad.

Overall, the film delivers. Because of the short running time, the film does feel a bit rushed at times. It would definitely have benefited from an additional thirty or forty minutes to give us breathing room and character development, but what is there is alright, if a little disappointing.

Anne Heche is a little weak as Lois, while James Marsters is chilling as Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast is solid.
Overall, this is a fine adaptation of the best-selling graphic novel of all time. Fans of ""Superman"" will find plenty to enjoy here, though others might find it a disappointment.

2817303,4,B000PE0G0A,"Far, far better than any of the live-action films. It had its flaws, the primary one being its length; it was too short to really hammer home the emotion of any of its three distinct stories (death, mourning, and rebirth).

I'll admit, particularly with the similar-but-not-quite art style, I was reticent to give up my affection for the DCAU (not to be confused with the DCU Animated Films banner, of which this is the first; Justice League: The New Frontier is next). While the idea of Adam Baldwin as Superman and James Marsters as Lex appeals to the Whedon fan inside me, they simply didn't own their parts the way George Newburn (liked him better than Tim Daly) and Clancy Brown did in the DCAU. Anne Heche was mostly forgettable as Lois, neither bad nor good, but to her credit, her scene with Martha Kent was heartbreaking.

The action was fantastic. Brutal, dirty, and violent, just as a fight between two (well, three, I suppose) titanic figures should be. I'd love to see the first third of this expanded and developed as the next live-action Superman movie, ending with Superman's death (oh, he'll of course be resurrected in the next movie, but it would be awesome). Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, the quick pace robs the story of much of the emotional complexity. Though, on second thought, that may not be the culprit. Justice League flirted with the idea of killing Superman in the ""Hereafter"" two-parter, and it was handled beautifully. There, you actually felt the loss experienced by the world; here, Superman gets a perfunctory funeral and has ""returned"" five minutes later. In hindsight, I blame the writing.

Still, it all comes together to form a fairly cohesive whole, and by focusing on the ancillary characters, makes Superman more interesting than he really has any right to be. Superman is most interesting when seen through the eyes of others; it's not his character, but the ideals he symbolizes that has kept him omnipresent for the last 70 years, and the movie wisely recognizes that.

Once again, DC has destroyed Marvel in the field of animation. Sure, it's not Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker,  or Justice League Unlimited, but it's somewhere up there. Some day Marvel might actually stumble upon their own Bruce Timm, but until then, I have faith that the man will continue making hands-down the best superhero animations known to man.",1204588800,2,2411,4.8707317073170735

For those who read the original story or have picked up the omnibus, it's important to note that this 78 minute movie was only INSPIRED by the original source -- it's not a retelling of the story. If anything, it's an Elseworlds telling of the Death of Superman, given that there are no Justice League to help Superman fight Doomsday, nor characters such as Steel and the other ""Supermen"" to deal with the aftermath of the fight.

Some times, especially early in the film, the audience is hit over the head quite hard about the morality of some characters. Lex Luthor, you know, is EEEVIL. Doomsday is EEEVIL. Yeah, we get it.

If you can separate this story from the original source, the movie is enjoyable enough, though it does have streaks of unevenness. Most of that unevenness lies with Lex's character. He doesn't seem to have the depth of intelligence in this film that the character does in all other media (yes, even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Challenge-of-the-Super-Friends-Volumes-1-2-DC-Comics-Classic-Collection/dp/B0007XG0JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Challenge of the Super Friends, Volumes 1-2 (DC Comics Classic Collection)</a>). The fight with Doomsday also falls very flat. People know the outcome, but the emotional drama that goes with it wasn't there. It also finished awfully early in the film for a movie called ""Superman Doomsday"".

It was, in my mind, worth the $3.99 Unbox rental, but I wouldn't go out to buy it. From reading other reviews, I would have liked to have seen the extras on the disc, but not that badly.

If you are a fanboy/girl of the Bruce Timm Superman: TAS then this 'toon will be slightly off in the animation.  But, trust me, you stop noticing after getting swallowed in the storyline.

And, if none of that sells you on this movie, then any Kevin Smith fans should be sure to buy this because Kevin himself is in it and guest stars as himself and is voiced by himself.

2817310,4,B000PE0G0A,"Not earth-shattering perhaps, but nonetheless a pretty good adaptation/distillation of the ""Death of Superman"" comic book storyline of the early 90's.  This one-shot animated film can't possibly have the impact of the original storyline, where Superman was actually assumed dead for several months before DC Comics finally brought him back, but it still nicely dramatizes the amazing notion of someone/something actually being able to kill the Man of Steel.

While there's lots of action, I particularly liked that the script didn't overdose viewers on endless bombastic action just because it's more affordable to do huge action sequences in an animated film than in a live-action one.  This one gives us action when it's required, but also equally concentrates on good character interaction, well-done quiet moments, and unfolding its story in an effective, dramatic fashion.  A lot of the Marvel direct-to-DVD animated films can learn from the approach employed here; those Marvel animated films tend to start out well but then get engulfed in endless explosions and chaos that have little to do with the characters those movies are supposed to be about.

A minor warning, though: continuity fans will just have to take a chill pill and sit back and enjoy the story at hand and not be bothered by the fact that it doesn't tie in with any other recent animated versions of the Man of Steel, Doomsday, Lex Luthor, Lois Lane, etc.  It's just meant to be a stand-alone adaptation of a popular comic book storyline.

Generous extra features, including an entertaining commentary track by the film's creative forces, add extra value to this DVD, which was already well worth purchasing for the solid movie alone.",1201824000,,1709,5.125899280575539

In the comic books, issue after issue, a war between Superman and Doomsday continues. In this movie, the battle is short and a totally different story is portrayed.",1200700800,,487,4.809523809523809
2817313,4,B000PE0G0A,"Bruce Timm has taken the next step in his already acclaimed career. After spending so much time on creating the television sensation of the DC Animated Universe it was obviously time to move to the next stage. Superman Doomsday, created in the tradition of Batman:Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker is exactly where we are heading.

Superman Doomsday while not entirley accurate is a film version of one of the most shocking and most talked about moments in the history of Comic Books. The Death of Superman from the arrival of Doomsday all the way to the triumphant return of the Man of Steel brought an entire world of fans to their knees and many a tears were shead when one of the most beloved characters in pop culture went through such a dark and turbulant story. Bruce Timm really tried to capture the main meat of this story and really holding true to the main points of this entire saga.

Most of the complaints are the battle between Superman and Doomsday is too short and very shallow. I being 10 years old reading that issue remebered it as being just that nothing but one issue and a huge slugfest leading up to Superman's death. The four supermen before the return of the real one. The evil superman was pretty much a conglomorate of all four of them just leaving the viewer not as confused as he or she could have been epscially since probably most of the these viewers didn't actually follow the real story in print.

The possitives of this film was the fact that Bruce Timms story telling didn't hold back. Given a PG-13 rating allowed the story's violent and emotional parts be hard to watch and times hard to bear as it was to read the story. The animation as well as the voice actors used can go either way. I understood after watching the special features that this movie was made in this style to capture the mood and feel of the origional story and the voice actors used in the origional shows may not have been able to really show the emotions or feelings needed for such powerful moments seen in the movie. My real beef in this story was the part that was based on Funeral for a Friend. I hated the fact that this movie only featured Superman and Superman characters at the funeral. After a show like Justice League, people really should have seen the impact that the death of Superman had on the other heroes of the DC universe. Having them on screen for just a brief moment would have made the funeral alot more emotional.

If you are a fan of the DC universe this movie is a must to add to your collection. It definitely helps you forget Braniac Attacks and shows us that this is only the begining of great things to come in the DC animated universe.",1200009600,2,2703,4.443548387096774
2817314,3,B000PE0G0A,"If you spent a good bit of money keeping track of this Superman storyline when it appeared over the multiple Superman titles... I'd advise you to run far from this.  As a fan of the animated Superman tv shows not to mention the comic books, I couldn't help but wince a bit while watching this.  I can well appreciate ""creative license"" but this came off more like creative hatchet job.  This is about as far from the Death of Superman story as they could conceivably get and the changes made make it a weak and pathetic substitute for the original material.

On that basis I think it's good that they went out and found different voice talent from that used on the tv show.  No need to mar the fine work done by the tv show's voice actors by tying them in to this.  So much of the true story is missing from Superman: Doomsday that I'm forced to wonder why they even bothered.  Most books turned film lose a bit in translation but those done well at least retain their core, their soul.  This however only superficially retains the obvious (because they had no choice) but the heart of what the original story told is nowhere to be found.

So, with all that you're probably wondering how I came to give it 3 stars. Simple, the special features! As an aspiring comic book artist I was completely engrossed by the videos of the actual artists and writers of the original comic book story arc.  It's quite surprising that such would be included on this dvd because it just underscores rather bluntly how good the original story was/is vs. the film made from it.

The special features alone make this dvd worth buying even though I got it free via subscription elsewhere.  It's really interesting to learn the story behind the story and how it affected the writers and artists alike in creating the Death of Superman.  There is a video of the actors who did the voice work for Doomsday but other than that the only commentary about the film is provided via narration by its creators as the film plays.  It's a rather stark contrast to everything else including a rather nice behind-the-scenes look at Justice League: New Frontiers and perhaps just points up just how bad this take on Death of Superman turned out to be.",1199577600,3,2215,4.518796992481203

I dare say this is the type of quality they've been working up to.

No, it's not the spitting image of the original comic book saga. It's more of a stripped down, alternate reality version. I was actually relieved that the creators focused on the core characters while keeping things simple. There is a plot twist but it's a rewarding one.

There are a lot of impressive things about this movie. The first is Supes battle with Doomsday. Thanks to that PG-13 rating the animators were able to make it more violent and catastrophic than what it would've been with a G or even PG rating. Then there's the emotional backlash from Lois, to Ma Clark, to the Daily Planet staff to the whole world. There's some really moving voice acting going on in that segment.

Then there's the plot twist. Yes, just when it seems like the movie is over something happens and things get really interesting. Overall, it's a great animated feature. Enjoy.",1199318400,,1190,4.739130434782608

2817319,1,B000PE0G0A,"It is my belief that superheroes are dark entities.  Let me explain further.  Over the course of many decades, Hollywood has attempted to grapple the popularity of comic book heroines by releasing big studio releases based on what they have seen.  It has been the opinion of many that these executives see color on the page, and immediately believe that the color is what has to translate onto the screen.  There have been countless examples of this happening in cinema, take the most recent ""Ghost Rider"", or ""Batman & Robin"" or even the debacle of the final X-Men film.  To bring it full circle, the reason that these films have not been successful, and why those smaller films seem to understand better the choices of the hero (i.e. why was ""The Punisher"" panned) and bring the grittiness to the surface.  It is when a director sees the hero as a fallen angel, someone who is just as dark inside as the villains that they fight (i.e. see the most recent ""Batman Returns""), that I believe they understand the printed page.  An example of a failure on both ends is the most recent direct-to-video release of the popular 90s comic disaster, the Death of Superman.  It stunned the world, killed the hero we believed couldn't die, and slowly and surely reconstructed the mythology of Superman.  This animated film destroys whatever soul was remaining within this story.  It takes creative risks, destroys sanity, and walks all over what is to eventually become of the Man of Steel.  To be honest, I like animated heroes (the Batman and early X-Men on FOX has been particularly entertaining), but this goes a bit too far and ultimately corrupts anything of value within the written story.

What made the story of Superman's death enjoyable was that there was just this unknown beast awakened, so to speak, and fate brought these two indestructible beings together.  It was the battle that drew us to the page, it was the punches that Superman threw and the unknown of this being later to be known as Doomsday, which kept us turning page after page.  (Editor's note: I realize that perhaps Doomsday had been seen in other story arcs, that perhaps there had been other back story eventually created, and that other events had been leading up to this, but when I was young I just read this one particular story - the Death of Superman, and it is the basis for this review.)  To fill nearly an hour and a half, perhaps the creators of this film decided they needed to bring Luther in to prove that they were making a Superman story, perhaps they needed to demonstrate a pathetic love story between Superman and Lane, perhaps they needed to show mass destruction in which people HAD TO HAVE died or been wounded, but it was done so poorly that it transformed a good idea direct-to-DVD to a DVD destined to be eventually found in the $1 bin.  They story should have revolved around the big meeting between Doomsday and Superman, but instead the culmination involved this sub-story with Lex Luthor.  I was hurt.  Everything from Olsen getting a job at a trashy magazine, to the cheap secondary villain, to renegade clones just hurt over time.  This was not the story of Superman fighting Doomsday, but instead several small stories using that brief moment to grow.  It was not the excitement that I anticipated, nor wanted.

With the story in ruins, one would hope that the voice talent would at least bring a level of professionalism to the table, but again, I have been wrong many times before.  Adam Baldwin is a ""Firefly"" god, but he doesn't quite have the power for Superman's voice.  There wasn't the strength or humanity behind it, but simply your average man's voice behind the blue suit and cape.  Anne Heche, voicing Lois Lane, seemed (and sounded) like she had been smoking twelve packs a day.  It sounded like Anne Heche doing voice work on an animated film, not an actual character on screen.  The rest were equally as bad.  Case in point, if you need to use Kevin Smith's voice as a cameo in the film, than you need to realize that your film is failing.  He is not credited, but I do believe they used him twice for two insignificant characters, but it was obviously him.  There is one scene where Superman battles, well, with himself (when viewed you will understand), and the dialogue between the two are hysterical.  It is not supposed to be, but it had me nearly in tears.

Story in shambles, voice work below average, what else could go wrong with this simple little direct-to-DVD release?  Two more issues arose upon viewing which will confuse the more novice film viewer.  Superman will not allow a child to be killed by Doomsday, but has no problem causing millions of dollars worth of structural damage to the city by merely hitting the beast?  Who eventually has to pay for the rebuilding?  Who made sure nobody was holding a meeting or having a small family reunion in one of those skyscrapers or obvious tenement buildings in Metropolis?  The big battle raged which was fun, but the consistency of this animated Superman was perplexing.  Why would he save one, yet endanger others?  Or, could it be possible that all of this section of Metropolis was empty at this time during the morning?  Too much chaos was happening to believe that nobody else was hurt during the rumble.  The second point, which is brief, but those understanding the comics will get it - why were there no questionable supermen born from this disaster.  Was anyone willing to follow the comic story at all - or was there more money in creating their own storyline?

Overall, this was not the film I was expecting.  Again, having grown up reading that single volume of how the ""Man of Steel"" dies, I wanted to see perhaps a synopsis of his life, some of his adventures, all leading up (character development and story) to his big battle with Doomsday.  I realize that more happens afterwards, at least in the comic, but what was presented here, in this film, is not the world or story that I imaged.  In fact, all imagination was stripped away with the poorly voiced characters, the minimal ""darkness"" that needed to surround this iconic character, and the complete chaos caused with minimal consequences.  I must say that the one point I did like from this animated feature was the fact that people did die.  Not tons, but enough to surround the point.  The escape of Doomsday, the fight with Superman, and even Lex's creature all killed, and it was interesting to see that in this DVD.  In the end, it was a sorry, pathetic little film that is worthless compared to the comic it represents.  For those fans, or even us casual ones, this represented nothing but commercialism and capitalistic opportunity - two words that should not be associated with either film or the printed page.

2817324,3,B000PE0G0A,"With Brice Timm at the helm I though for sure this would have blown me out of my shoes.  The fight was fantastic and despite other opinions I think the voice acting was too.  What I thought the real problem with this movie was is that it missed how Superman's death effected the world and didn't feel as big as OH MY GOD SUPERMAN IS DEAD!  I think it was the lack of other heroes getting whomped on was a big missing piece that made it clear that superman was the only thing powerful enough to stop Doomsday and he's a real danger to the planet.  And the whole return was so far removed from the comic to fit in a movie I really didn't like it.

It looks to me like it was made with an attempt to be appealing new viewers who don't know the storyline rather than fans, but something went wrong in the writing for this one.",1197849600,,822,4.080745341614906

Now we have this, a 70 minute movie covering roughly the same matieral that was covered in, oh, about a year's worth of comics. Needless to say, the movie suffers somewhat as a result. You don't get to see the JLA fighting Doomsday, you don't see much of the funeral or the way Superman's death impacted the wider world, and you don't get any of the other Supermen, like Steel or Superboy. You DO get another Superman, but only the one.

Plus a lot of what was done during the fight between Doomsday and Superman didn't make any sense. Why would Doomsday smack Supes around a bit, know that he's not dead, and go try to kill a few other people? Bad tactics. Make sure your enemy is dead before you move onto the next one. What is this, ADD Doomsday? (meantime, in Central City... ""Look, it's ADD Man! He's coming to save us! He's coming to- oh, no, wait. He's seen something shiny. We're doomed"")

As this is a direct-to-video movie, they were able to ratchett up the language and violence by a fair margin. The film is PG-13 and looks it, so bear this in mind.

The animation was, as I expected, top-notch. The acting was generally ok all around, but I REALLY missed Clancy Brown as the voice of Lex Luthor. The current fellow sounds more like Lex Loser and wasn't really memorable.

This is an alright movie, but really more worth renting than buying. If Amazon allowed half-stars it would have two-and-a-half, but since it doesn't, I'll round it up to three.

I was very excited when this direct-to-DVD project was announced as it held the promise of great stories being produced without the constraints and limitations of commercial TV. With that said I must acknowledge how disappointed I was with this DVD. The animation was mediocre at best. The set pieces and action sequences were good, but the character depictions were horrible overall and Superman's face was the worse. Attempts to depict a strong jaw and high cheekbones just left him looking scarred and almost unrecognizable. The vocal actors were good with the exception of Anne Heche as Lois Lane who is annoying to the point of distraction. The above issues could easily have been overlooked if the script had delivered a good story.

2817336,4,B000PE0G0A,"When I first heard that this dvd was available, I knew that I had to get it. One of my best memories was sitting in the sun read the graphic novel 'The Death of Superman' where they introduced Doomsday.

Having seen, and enjoyed, the recent work with the JLA and Superman Animated, I knew that the animators had a powerful tool at their disposal to tell the story. Using a slightly matured look and different actors gave the movie a little bit of a stand alone feel that was needed for the movie, considering the story it was dealing with.

I was happy to see that they used some of the story line from 'The Return of the Supermen' comics that followed. The only thing that could have made the movie a better is if writers had also incorporated a couple more characters form that storyline, eg Steel and The Cyborg. This could have lead on to the use of the 'Superman/Doomsday,Hunter/Prey' storyline in the future.

If you have not read the original story in the book, then this movie will a bit of a departure from the animated Superman we all know and love, and I recommend that you give it piece on Superman history a go.

For me, having read and really enjoyed the books, I think that there could have been just a little bit more put in to make it a really excellent movie.",1195603200,,1277,4.352941176470588
2817337,1,B000PE0G0A,"For parents of young children who just want to see Superman fly, flight and win in the end, this movie is perfect.  Put it on for the kids and you have  75 minutes to do something you need to take care of.  For everyone else (comic fans, cartoon fans, good acting and logical story fans) this movie is just as perplexing as it is disappointing.  The changing of voice actors (something I found myself hating as the very first words of the film from Luthor were spoken because they were not voiced by Clancy Brown) painfully shows how the new actors do not know how to effectively emote with there voices.  I'm not saying they are bad actors (well, maybe Anne Heche) but it is apparent they are not used to acting with their voices alone.  Because of this every character comes out as one-dimensional or utterly ridiculous.

But the bigger problem in the movie is writing.  One of the great things about the previous Superman/Justice League cartoons is that they spent so much energy to building character and creating rich, complex story lines.  It was a fun part to the show, to watch our favorite superheroes think through a problem and find a solution.  In this movie though, all information and revelations simply appear out of thin air at a moment's notice.  Everything is out of proportion.  Parts of the movie we really want to see are shortened for the sake of ""fitting it all in"", while plot elements that we don't care about or have no use for are slotted much more time than they should have been given (which is none).

So if you are a kid who wants to see your favorite superhero of all time and doesn't care about things like plot, character and good animation, then go ahead and get this, for it won't disappoint on the respect.

I was wrong, the story flows a lot better than I would have expected it it doesn't lose the emotion.

The Doomsday fight itself was cut shorter than what is shown in the comics, but it was still pretty powerful and I actually felt sad when the sad moments occured.

This clarification for some reason always seems to bring on even more chuckles over a bottle of wine with friends than it does clarify the matter.

Anyway, My kids were as captivated as I was for Superman - Doomsday. What is with the PG-13 rating of Superman - Doomsday?...I remember a couple of scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Nemo/dp/B00005JM02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Nemo</a>&nbsp;that were more intense for young children, but Nemo gets a G rating. I'll tell ya, I think that the MPAA needs a rating themselves. That would be an 'F'. Rest assured, Superman - Doomsday is definitely for kids too unless you shield your kids from the same kinds of intensity that can be found in the most intense chapters of Nemo and other Disney G-rated classics.

Now, on the other side of the coin...Doomsday does viciously do away with some of the folks that cross his path. So a little Parental Guidance could be in order for kids 7 and under. But any 10 year old that needs Parental Guidance for Superman - Doomsday doesn't get out much.

Superman - Doomsday isn't quite as well put together as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League/dp/B000CSTK3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League)</a>&nbsp;series, but it was pretty good. I don't follow the comic book series, but I understand that there are some continuity issues between this movie and the DC Comics...most notably the origin of Doomsday. But the story told on the DVD held up, and was pretty cool.

LexCorp's minions find an alien craft in some mine and accidentally unleash Doomsday (an ugly looking monster) from the craft. The monster wreaks havoc; Superman comes to the rescue; and the result could be a dramatic change in a World that is used to having Superman around to protect everyone.

It is not necessary to have ever seen a Justice League episode or read a DC Superman comic book to enjoy the Superman - Doomsday DVD. On the contrary...familiarity with the comic books or TV series might hinder your viewing pleasure based on the varying continuity factors.

Final word: sit back and enjoy. And don't forget to provide that all-important Parental Guidance for the kids that have never seen the 6 o'clock news.",1194912000,13,2473,5.295918367346939
2817343,3,B000PE0G0A,"Boy, is this a tough one.  Once again, the ""powers that be"" bring us an off shoot of a sure fire project with what they think it should be instead of the fans.  Make no mistake about it, this is a must addition to any Superman DVD collection as it is very well produced but falls short in all the areas you can read in other reviews.  The producers and directors of the Superman movies also appear to be of the notion that the public is tired of the Man of Steel on the big screen.  The problem is, we're tired of the same old story being retold as was the problem with Superman Returns which is Superman, the Movie retold.  A great idea would be to bring this epic battle to the big screen.  I've written an outline myself which also includes Batman in the movie to give it that ""World's Finest"" flavor.  There's no doubt in my mind that such a project would line 'em up out the theater doors like they've never seen.  But, I'm just a simple fan.  What in the world would I know?",1194912000,,980,4.142857142857143
2817344,3,B000PE0G0A,"Well, this movie didn't really have much in common with the Death of Superman storyline other than that Doomsday was in it and Superman died.  The whole rest of the story seemed to be taken in bits and pieces from the movies (mostly Superman Returns).  I found myself watching scenes and thinking ""Ah, I know that scene.  It's from Superman II."" and so on.  This movie has almost nothing in common with the comic or the book (The Death and Life of Superman) either.

It wasn't really the complete deviation from the story that bugged me.  It was the little things that didn't need to be changed.  See below for examples.

--Did the director or writer even read the comic?  Doesn't look like it.  Let's see--Lois is having an affair with Superman, but doesn't know that he's Clark Kent (she guesses, but he hasn't told her).  This would be from Superman Returns. In the comic (and book version), they're already engaged and the secret has already been told to Lois.

--Only Martha Kent is shown.  We are to assume that Jonathon is dead?  This would be from Superman Returns again.

--Jimmy Olsen quits the Daily Planet and goes to work for a tabloid?  What was the point of that, exactly?

--Lex Luthor is shown to be a super genius (ex: he comes up with a cure for MS and has other diseases being worked on).  Evidently, they got him mixed up with Brainiac (hey, maybe they DID read a comic or two!)  And when did he start looking like an anorexic?  I won't even go into how different the comic Lex is from this version.  Would take way too long.  Let it suffice to say that they took the easy way out using a Lex that everyone was more or less familiar with already.

I understand the shortcuts.  The whole 'real' story couldn't have been told in one DVD.  However, the things that were changed for no apparent good reason (those items listed above) were EXTREMELY annoying.

If you don't know anything about the Superman universe, this is a pretty good movie.

If you don't know much about Superman, rent this and see if you like it.  I don't see how any Superman fan could not walk away from this a bit irritated, though.

As for the voices and characters:

Anne Heche did a nice job as Lois.  She was shown as being uber-skinny, but that's a nitpick.  She seemed to be in character.

Baldwin (Adam?) was okay.  Made Supes sound like he was half asleep, but it wasn't horrible.  He was drawn like a blockhead, but that's the way everyone wants to draw him nowadays.  Laugh if you want to, but the best cartoon version of Superman was on Superfriends.  Really.

Swoosie Kurtz did an okay job with her tiny role as Martha Kent.  I have a problem with her voice, though, because whenever I hear it, I picture Swoosie instead of whatever character she's voicing, but that's just me.

All in all, I'd say rent it first.",1194652800,,2817,4.457760314341847
2817345,2,B000PE0G0A,"I have pretty much the same gripe as the countless others who didn't like this DVD. Storyline sucked, not by the comic, etc. etc. But I wanted to point out another annoying aspect of this cartoon... the voice of Lois Lane. It was horrible!! it sounded like the lady held her nose closed throughout the entire voice-over! so annoying... no connection with her characters emotions... monotoned nose-talking... completely turned me off numerous times over. The only thing keeping me going was the hope that it would get better... but unfortunately it never did.",1194566400,2,558,5.010752688172043
2817346,3,B000PE0G0A,"The Death of Superman was perhaps the greatest publicity stunt in comic book history. We comic fans knew that Superman would never truly be dead but the event did what it set out to do...garner world-wide media attention and sell a gazillion copies. The story itself is hardly a classic. Doomsday was some character cooked up in a meeting with various DC artists and writers. He would not even get an origin until several years later. It's interesting to note that while watching the documentary on the comic event, the story might not have ever taken place if DC had not been forced to push back the wedding of Superman and Lois Lane because Warner Bros. wanted the even to first happen on the old Lois & Clark TV show. With their plots for the year having to be shelved, the Superman team hatched the ultimate plot...""let's just kill `im!""

The story of Superman's death and return was played out over dozens of comic issues in all four Superman titles. So obviously in a 75 minute movie a lot had to be condensed or lost entirely. Doomsday is accidentally released from his prison deep beneath the Earth's surface by employees of Lexcorp who are illegally mining. Doomsday immediately goes on a rampage, killing all of the Lexcorp employees (hence the PG-13 rating) and heads for Metropolis. One of the story elements from the comics that was dropped was Doomsday's battle with the Justice League. This is a solo Superman adventure which disappointed me because I was looking forward to seeing Booster Gold (the dumbest Superhero in history) get trounced on the small screen.

The climactic battle between Superman and Doomsday maintains that bigger than life feel of the comics. You may recall that the final battle was told entirely in splash pages. Here the scope is just as big as entire buildings crumble straight down in a scene eerily similar to the Twin Towers on 9/11. I won't give away the hows, the death scene was handled much more dramatically than the double-knockout of the comic. Now it's important to note that this all happens in about the first half hour so more than half the film focuses on life in metropolis after Superman's death, and his eventual return. Again, owing to limited time, we get the appearance of a man who claims to be Superman. What the writers essentially did was take the idea behind the Superboy clone, the evil Cyborg Superman, and the Eradicator Superman and meld them all together. This Superman soon appears but Lois immediately knows something isn't quite right about him.

The one aspect of the film that most disappointed me was the part Lex Luthor played in it. While Lex had little to do with the story in the comics, here's he's given a central role. We've had five big screen Superman films and now one animated film and Lex Luthor has played a main role in all but Superman III. In as much as an animated film is going to appeal much more to a core comic fan audience, I would have liked to have seen the writers be a little more creative than falling back on Lex Luthor as the main villain again.

The animation is only average, and honestly, probably not as good as the Superman animated series or the Justice League. Supes had these two lines on either side of his face to define his cheekbones but they never moved with his expressions so they ended up looking more like scars. Weird! The voice talent on the other hand was very good. Adam Baldwin did a find job as Superman as did James Marsters as Lex Luthor.

What really brings my grade of the DVD up are the special features. There is a 45 minute documentary ""Requiem and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" which is truly outstanding. This film details the entire process of the creation of the comic story featuring comments by writers and artists: Louise Simonson, Roger Stern, Dan Jurgens, Jerry Ordway, Jon Bogdanove, Brett Breeding, Paul Levitz, and former publisher Jeanette Kahn. While they deny doing the story as a publicity event, I can't deny the sincerity that they put into the story. It seems even they were surprised at what a media stir the event caused. The movie itself is good...not great, but the DVD package is worth it for the historical documentary.

2817347,5,B000PE0G0A,"From the first moment that Doomsday killed all the miners in such a graphic way, I was hooked. Humans were tossed around like dolls, punched through buildings and cement (yuck), necks snapped like twigs, and all this was shown and not left to our imagination.

The battle between Superman and Doomsday was action packed, brutal (can't stop using that word), bloody and ultimately very satisfying. This isn't your average kids cartoon aimed at 5-9 year olds. This is a clear mature cartoon for adults and I say it's about time.

The drawings were okay, not great. Superman was drawn to look older, more wrinkles on his face. While Lois and Luther looks like they just got out of college. Doomsday looked bad @SS.

Lois dating Superman for 6 months and still not knowing that he and Clark are one in the same was a weak story plot point, but I got past it.

2817352,3,B000PE0G0A,"I enjoyed the story of the death and rebirth of Superman in its comics and then in its  graphic novel format. It was an intriging year long comic book series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Death-and-Return-of-Superman-Omnibus/dp/1401215505/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Death and Return of Superman Omnibus</a>. However when it comes to the DVD version of this story, I felt it was slightly lacking the epicness and the scope that the original comics had

The news is not all that bad. The DVD  does have the new voice talent that is totally different from the TV Superman the animated series. It has interest vocal casting. Firefly's Adam Baldwin brings a different edge to Superman. Claney Brown may have been Lex Luthor on The TV animated adventures, but James (Spike from Buffy) Marsters nailed it on this DVD. Anne Heche's vocal Lois Lane is the weakest link of this piece.

 This DVD's  animation seemed like a little like  Jack  Kirby style comic art, rather the S.T.A.S or the recent Justice League cartoon. However this PG-13 cartoon lacks the luster that this year long graphic novel series had. Th battle royale, told in shadow and crimson hues,  is what gives this cartoon its PG-13 rating

Also the main part of the story arc in the graphic novel was ""the funeral of a Friend"" storyline..which was also mostly delete in this 75 minute adaptation. I understand that producer Bruce Timm ideal is to let this be a stand alone piece (basicly a Superman only piece), but what is missing for me was the world grieving as a collective in the story arc that this film did not use. Note not another superhero shows up in his funeral which would seem strange in a world filled with superheroes

On the whole, this piece as a stand alone was good, but very rushed. For 75 minutes they jam pack the film, I wish this was two hours and they took more time to give more story

I hope the Derwyn Cooke's  The New Frontier (The Justice League)animated adaptation which comes out next year is fares better than this made for video animated DVD.

2817355,3,B000PE0G0A,"First, I watched the movie, the special features, and the main creators, which gave some VERY interesting background about why the Superman/Doomsday comic event happened in the first place.  Second, the movie was solidly constructed, and the acting and visual effects were done well.

However, there were some HUGE plot holes, that bugged me immensely.  The fight scene between Doomsday and Superman had the biggest one:  Remember that Superman knocks Doomsday into orbit -- so WHY did he bother bringing him down?  And WHY did he aim for the middle of Metropolis?  Think about this -- Doomsday can't fly.  So all Supes had to do was put Doomsday in orbit (or on the Moon for that matter), go soak up solar energy for several days, go back to Doomsday, who's probably suffocated by now, and beat the CRAP out of him.  In fact, Supes could've knocked Doomsday to the Sun, and that would've finished everything -- but no, from a miles-high orbit, Superman shoves him down to the middle of Metropolis (instead of a safe area), killing himself and Doomsday.

This is a case where the creators were so intent about the emotional effect of the story that they forgot the story itself -- kinda similar to XMEN 3, where Magneto moves the Golden Gates Bridge? (The lab's in Alcatraz, baby, made of concrete fortified by IRON -- just crush the lab, and problem solved!).  The artists wanted something so spectacular, they threw reason out the window, and so I came away from the scene, thinking, ""Boy -- Superman just killed himself and a LOT of innocent people there).

One other thing bugged me -- premarital sex between Supes and Lois.  Now, I'm conservative, but that's not what bugged me:  The creators said on the DVD extras that they were trying to show what happens when Superman goes, and the moral center decays.  Well -- if we're talking about moral centers here, then why is Supes sleeping around?  Remember, this is a guy raised by a conservative Christian farming couple -- so if morals is a topic here, then are we saying that killing is a no, but sleeping around is a yes?  What moral center are we arguing is vacant when Superman dies?

Again, the movie was fairly well done.  Personally, I would've liked the regular ""Superman-Animated Series"" voices in, and using the version of Doomsday from the ""Justice League"" animated series, but I understand why they didn't do that.  But I can't rate this movie higher than three stars because the artists overreached for the dramatic, and left some huge holes in the plot.  Too bad -- but then again, this is a direct-to-video DVD, right?",1193529600,,2588,4.734375

I knew this had to be the case, a true movie adaptation would have taken several hours to properly tell. What I didn't expect, however was how few similiarities the two stories would share. Their portrayal of the relationship between Lois and Superman was most disturbing to me. It made sense to leave out the Justice League and Cadmus Labs so that the story could be more easily told, but there were certain aspects of the fight which should not have been left out.

I was completely dissapointed... It left a sour taste in my mouth.",1193184000,4,421,4.5131578947368425
2817362,3,B000PE0G0A,"There's good stuff to recommend in this DVD, but there are some awfully big caveats I feel one should know before buying:

1.)  Straight-to-video titles rarely have the production values of theatrical animated releases, so know going in that the animation is no great shakes - a notch above the latest Superman and Justice League shows on Kids WB!, but not a huge step up by any means.  There are some inspired moments of animation, but they are few and far between.

2.)  Don't be taken in by the ""PG-13"" rating.  I suppose slapping ""PG-13"" on it works to WB/DC's advantage, suggesting the movie is a ""hard"" Superman story that attracts the fanboys.  But while it does contain some language, violence and themes that you'd never see on the Animated Series on TV, in relation to what you see in theatrical films, this is squarely ""PG"" all the way.

3.)  There is no way they could cram in everything from the Death/Rebirth of Superman storylines into a 90-minute film.  I doubt they could effectively squeeze it all into a 3-hour film.  So there's no Justice League getting whupped by Doomsday, no Supergirl or ""heroic"" Lex Luthor II, no Steel or Superboy, no Cyborg and Mongul colluding to destroy Coast City.  No Kryptonian War-Suit.

If you go in with all that in mind, the film isn't so bad.  IMHO, they did a good job of condensing the essentials of the storyline into a single digestible story.  Those who strive for continuity with the comic books need not apply.  They did manage to include things like the Eradicator (kinda), how Metropolis deals with the absence of Superman, the pain of Lois and Martha not being able to grieve openly, Clark being resusicated in the Fortress, the black suit and long hair, and the issue of whether Metropolis would be better served by boy-scout Superman, or a darker, more violent protector.  So it's not a total break with the comic storyline.

Some of the dialogue is cringe-inducing, and I really didn't like Anne Heche as Lois.  I've always found her voice to be a bit grating.  But I really enjoyed Adam Baldwin as Clark/Supes.  There's a great scene with the film's version of the Eradicator, where he rescues a cat from a tree and talks about ""sweating the small stuff"".  Watch for it - one of the best parts of the film.

The animation was really a bit of a let-down - given how far in advance they'd been hyping this release, I really was hoping for something a good bit better than an episode of the TV show.  So I couldn't give this four stars.  Still, I would have given it 3.5 if I could have, as the overall narrative is pretty solid.

If you really like the Animated Series, and/or really want to see a movie-like translation of the Death of Superman storyline, pick this up.  All others might be advised to rent and watch before buying.",1193097600,65,2797,4.586693548387097
2817363,2,B000PE0G0A,"Mediocre in execution, adaptation, animation and acting, and that's when it's actually hitting it's best stride. The replacement of all the major voice actors really hurts, as the new cast just doesn't work as well as the superior cast they've replaced. The animation quality ranges from bad to mediocre, to occasional flashes of more, but an animated movie that looks terrible has a huge strike against it.

The movie is different from the DC TV shows, aside from the inferior animation(it's ridiculous that the TV shows have better animation and style than this drek), in that it shows blood and people getting killed.

For those who say it has to be judged on its own, don't go there - without the memory of the source material, not a single star would be warranted for this review.

2817368,1,B000PE0G0A,"I'll try not to rehash what others have said on here, but what I will do is share the reasons I thought the original story in the comics story arcs worked so well and then how this 'movie' compares. The overall story was truly epic and told over three 'acts' if you will:

1) The death of Superman: The Justice League went up against Doomsday and couldn't stop him. Even Superman got bashed around when he tried to take him on initially before making his 'last stand' at Metropolis. The iconic image of the Superman's yellow 'S-Shield' from his tattered cape blowing like a flag was awesome and captured something of the loss of Earth's greatest hero when he died (photographed by Jimmy Olsen).

2) World without a Superman: In my opinion, the emotional heart of the story dealing with the reaction of individuals to the loss of Superman (supporting characters, heroes etc) and the whole world. My favourite moments were when Clarks parents couldn't even be at the funeral of their son to protect his secret identity and the most tear-jerking moment when Jonathan 'Pa' Kent is in the barn reminiscing about his time with Clark when he was growing up. ""How could I be talking to anyone?"" he states, facing the grim reality that his son is gone. PLUS the awesome cliff hanger of this 'act' with the sightings of FOUR Supermen! Could any of them be our Kal-El back from the dead? Oh, the mystery!

3) The return of Superman: Four Supermen and bits of evidence to keep you guessing that any one of them could be `the real deal'. By far the most interesting part of the overall tale, in my view. Plus the final battle with a true world threatening menace was a very good conclusion.

So - what are the problems with this movie? Well, I'm sad to say that in this movie there is:
1. No Justice League
2. The Doomsday part is very brief (and also they make out he's a machine - oops).
3. No S-Shield on the cape when it's flowing in the wind
4. A funeral that is `played down' compared to the original (Lois' grieving is just awful)
5. No Jonathan Kent (hence we are robbed of emotional content)
6. No Supergirl or the 4 Supermen (only one shoddy doppelganger to replace them)
7. No epic conclusion (in fact, the ending was particularly weak.

Anything good? Well, despite the animation looking inferior to the 90's Batman series the voice actors for Superman and Lex Luthor (yay Spike) do a great job. Another nice touch is the visual impact that Superman and Doomsdays blows have on the nearby buildings. Ultimately though, aspects such as this can only be great when used to tell a great story.

I acknowledge that the reality is the entire story could not have been captured in 75 minutes or even 90 or 120 minutes. So how's this for an idea: make it over TWO movies!!!! The first could deal with the death of Superman and World without a Superman (ending with a cliff-hanger of four 'sightings' of Superman), followed by a second movie purely dealing with the 'return'. Yes some elements would still need to be trimmed in the sense of some of the secondary stories (Arms war in Steel for example) but the overall majesty of the story would have been preserved. And Superboy was referred to as SuperMAN in this tale so there's no argument with the Salkinds!!! And we could own 3 hours of Superman celluloid to be proud of.

C'mon DC - you could have made twice the money AND more importantly created something faithful that does justice to both the story, the fans AND opened the mind of people not usually rating comic adaptations to a truly epic tale. Please don't mess up `The Judas Contract' or the rumoured `Kingdom Come'.

Disappointed.",1192752000,6,3638,4.560490045941807
2817369,5,B000PE0G0A,"In 1992, one of the biggest events in comics' history was taking place over the course of multiple issues of DC Comics' long-running 'Superman' titles. That event would be the landmark 'Death of Superman' storyline. That storyline followed by the 'World Without a Superman' and 'Return of Superman' storylines contain some of the best moments in the Man of Steel's enduring career (in my opinion), and to this day rank amongst some of my most favorite comic book stories ever written. Fans of the comics, myself included, have often wondered and even hoped that one day a movie would be made chronicling this story, but realistically I knew it would never happen, not in live action anyway. Too much money, much too massive of a storyline, and the studios didn't appear to be all that interested. However, after the massive successes of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and ""Superman: The Animated Series"" followed by ""Justice League"", animator/director Bruce Timm was given the go-ahead by Warner Brothers to begin work on an adaptation of this very storyline to be told in the form of animation. A medium that is perfectly suited for just this type of epic story. And with Bruce Timm at the helm, I figured that this particular property was in really good hands.

""Superman: Doomsday"" is a loose adaptation of the epic storyline chronicling Superman's death and resurrection. When Lexcorp accidentally unearths a spaceship, they unknowingly cause the release of a merciless killer monster. As the monster known as Doomsday cuts a massive swath of damage, only one man appears capable of stopping such an evil force of nature. And so, Superman (Adam Baldwin) flies head-on into battle against the creature, matching him blow for blow, neither combatant seeming to have an advantage over the other. As the battle wears on Superman makes one final, last-ditch attempt to stop Doomsday, but sadly in order to stop him, Superman sacrificed himself in the process as well. While the world mourns the loss of it's greatest hero, everything seems so bleak and the world needs a hero. When suddenly it appears that Superman may not be dead after all. As a man who appears to be Superman begins saving the citizens of Metropolis once more, people are both excited to see their hero alive, but curious how it's possible. However, as Superman begins to act much colder than he used to, showing no mercy at times to criminals, the citizen's of Metropolis wonder if maybe this 'Superman' may not actually be the real deal. To complicate matters even further another Superman appears, this one in a black suit, claiming to be the true Man of Steel. But which hero is the true one?

After achieving so much success with DC's many characters in animated form, would Bruce Timm's apparent golden touch work on the Man of Steel's best-selling graphic novel? The answer would be a resounding, 'Yes', and with flying colors, too. Bruce Timm's work here is among his finest, the animation is crisp (as we've come to expect from his work), the story is well-paced with plenty of action and drama, and the voice actors he gathered together are excellent as always.

I had rather high expectations with this particular movie, not just because I knew the talent behind the movie was exceptional, but also because this is such a beloved character and story arc that you want it to be done faithfully. Now, I know that this movie differs from the overall storyline from the comics, but as the creative team had pointed out there's not near enough time in a 75 minute movie to tell the amount of story contained in the Death and Return of Superman storyline. So of course some trimming was going to be required, and I wasn't at all disappointed by the results. I thought the creative license that was taken was appropriate, I mean sure one does miss the chance to see the Cyborg Superman, the Eradicator, and Superboy, even Steel on some minor level. But you have to realize there was no way to show all of that unless you spread the story out over multiple movies (which would have been great). In place of them Bruce and his team have rolled up all of those characters into one specific character in the movie, so on some level you do get a slight hint of each of those pretenders to the throne.

The actors that were chosen to bring their animated counterparts to life were all ones that had not previously been associated with any of the series' that Bruce Timm and his team had worked on over the years. A move that I somewhat liked, but also was a little frustrated with. I understood that the intention is to make these animated movies that Warner Brothers is producing be separate entities from the previous animated series', but I would have liked hearing Tim Daly or George Newbern voicing Superman (""Superman: The Animated Series"" and ""Justice League"" respectively) or even Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor again. Even without those actors, the cast for this movie was spot-on. I thought that Adam Baldwin did a terrific job of voicing Superman, and made it a point to provide different vocal inflections to signal the difference between Superman and the pretender. Anne Heche, though not my first choice for Lois Lane, actually did a really good job, and a couple of parts I actually really felt for her even though it was a cartoon. The remainder of the supporting cast were all equally strong in their performances, and each character was brought to life in very vivid ways that furhter enhanced the enjoyment I had for this movie. The quality of the voice acting, as it did during the various series', continues to serve as a testament to the terrific voice direction from Andrea Romano (long-time collaborator on the various animated series').

If there's one thing that can be said for Bruce Timm and company, is that they definitely know their heroes, and how to produce high-quality projects that allow them to resonate with the widest audience, from the hard core fans to the average viewer, there's a little something for everyone in each of their properties. From long-running animated series' to feature films, the future definitely seems bright for DC Comics' characters. In regards to this new batch of animated films that Warner Brothers and DC Comics are working on, ""Superman: Doomsday"" is definitely an incredible start, and sets the bar rather high for the films that will follow.

Overall the film is excellent with some great fight scenes and nice little twists and turns along the way. Although far from perfect with some flaws throughout, the creators in my opinion have done an excellent job in recreating years of comic book storylines into a single film. Some fans will complain that it's not true to the original and certain important bits have been left out but realistically it would be impossible to have recreated everything exactly due to the time frame and the different mediums of film and comics. Whats noticible in my opinion is that this is a film made for fans and not changed and dilluted like the very disapointing Superman returns of 2006 ( In this film Superman actually fights!!). I highly recommend this film to fans and non-fans alike. There's something here for everybody but the great action scenes will appeal to many I think.

2817373,4,B000PE0G0A,"""Superman Doomsday"" is pretty much what the title states.  Doomsday, unnamed in the movie, escapes from a subterranean prison and goes on a rampage.  Only Superman stands between the monster & the deaths of millions.  And it required the ultimate sacrifice to stop the beast.

Overall, it was a decent adaptation of the great Superman trilogy of story arcs (""The Death of Superman"", ""World Without a Superman"" & ""The Return of Superman"").  I did miss the other heroes banding together to try & stop Doomsday on his cross-country rampage and in the funeral procession.  The Lois-Clark relationship wasn't what I expected - it harkened back to the old days when Lois tolerated Clark but adored Superman.  (In the comics of the time, Lois & Clark were already engaged &, naturally, she knew he was Superman which brought more pathos to the comic death scene in my opinion.)

The voice casting, which was completely changed from the old cartoons, was pretty good for the most part.  The one grating aspect was Anne Heche as Lois Lane.  For the 1st 20 minutes or so, I heard her voice, not Lois.  (Here they should've retained Dana Delany for the voice.)  Adam Baldwin as Clark/Superman was a good choice as was Ray Wise for Perry White.  James Marsters, of Buffy/Angel fame, was good as Luthor but I missed the grating menace when Clancy Brown voiced the character.

A darker story than previous Superman outings but, given the subject matter, not surprising.  While it's not ""The Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"" or ""Batman Beyond: The Return of the Joker"", it's a worthy addition to the animated DC universe.",1192579200,2,1603,4.82051282051282

2817376,4,B000PE0G0A,"This review is from: Superman: Doomsday (DVD)
The problem with many of these low-rated reviews (not all), is that many of the reviewers who give poor reviews are either fans of the wonderful DC Universe series that have already come out (and I love all of the Bruce Timm and company created series: BATMAN, SUPERMAN, JUSTICE LEAGUE and even the criminally underrated, BATMAN BEYOND) or comic book fans. Or in some cases, both.

I am both and I loved this DVD! I will watch the movie more than once (at least once more with the creator commentary) and I am sure enjoy it each time.

And I think there are a lot of people who are neither, who either know Superman from one of the live-action series, from the movies or just from memories of reading the comics as kids or maybe even the old ""Super Friends"" shows (or even worse animated series featuring the Man of Steel). Many of those people will also enjoy this (but some of them will also have to leave their preconceptions at the door).

Make no mistake: this is a ONE-SHOT RETELLING of an epic story INSPIRED by an almost ""stand-alone"" story arc in a regular comic book series. ""Inspired"", not a total recreation. I like that. For me, that is a strength in this film.

I think that if people can both read and watch these stories as ""legends"" retold, it allows much more leeway for the creator as well as for the viewer.

I was not thrilled with the animation model for Superman at first, because of the lines on his face, but I quickly got used to that and got caught up in the story. And that is just about my only negative! Certainly not enough for me to rate it less than 4 and half stars at least.

No, this is NOT the exact same story from the graphic novel. No, there are no other super heroes in this one-shot universe--it is not connected to the continuity of the other DCU series, nor any other movie or comic book.

What this is, is similar in my mind to what Peter Jackson does in both the LORD OF THE RINGS and KING KONG. He is a storyteller and he tells HIS version of great stories.

That is what Bruce Timm and company did here: they tell their version of a great story. And this version more than survives the retelling: it THRIVES!

The writing is strong and to the point, the voice acting is very,very good: I like all the new voices. I thought Adam Baldwin did a great Superman, and James Marsters' Lex Luthor was good and evil. I even liked Ann Heche as Lois and I was set to NOT like her (I usually don't like her acting much).

The animation is a different style than the rest of the DCU animation, but the style they used here was fine and set this movie apart as the one shot it is supposed to be.

I know that many fans of the comic book series (and/or the animated DCU) miss or will miss the rest of the Justice League, the other ""Supermen"" that were part of the comic book graphic novel, etc. Or they will feel that other things were added that ""did not belong"" (as if there is some kind of ""religious canon"" to this material that prevents other storytellers to add and subtract what they need or want to to tell the story!).

I feel that in many cases, this is a lack of imagination based on either too much attachment to previous versions of a story or just lack of imagination in general.

This is a very entertaining, and I dare say even inspiring retelling of an epic story. For those who can put preconceptions aside and watch the whole movie (I think anyone who reviews a movie based on watching 10 minutes is not playing fair, unless there is something in the movie that is offensive or hurtful that prevents that), I think they will enjoy this. The special feature on the creation of the original comic book series, ""THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN"" is almost worth the price of this DVD alone (at least for me, but what do I know I am a comic book geek! Yes, I admit it!).

One more small caveat: THIS IS NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN! It has a well-earned PG13 rating. There is some blood, lots of people die (albeit often off-screen, but even then, the sound-effects make it bone-crushingly clear what is happening), there are sexual references (mild, but definitely PG13) and other things that make this film for older children, teens, and adults.

My wife and I both enjoyed it very much. I am looking forward to more DC one shots like this. I think it gives the creators a lot of leeway to really shine and do what they do best, be creative (not simply repeat either what they have already done or what others have done).

There are a lot of cool trailers, and at least nice three special features that I like a lot (I can do without the little game: these games are always too me a waste of information space).

P.S. We wanted to like the Marvel Animated feature: ULTIMATE AVENGERS, but that was no where near as good as this. But that is another story for another review!",1192320000,3,4852,4.337748344370861
2817377,5,B000PE0G0A,"When I first saw the way Superman and Lois were drawn I thought uch! But,as I watched I came to really enjoy this re-imaging of the Superman universe.  There is no way they could have told the whole Doomsday saga in 75 minutes without drastically changing the story.  I really appreciate the way the story was altered using Lex Luther as the primary catalyst.  Additionally, the scenes in the Fortress of Solitude were very well done.  I particularly enjoyed the Superbot.  The use of Martha Kent without Jonathon (a divergence from the comic) and her relationship with Lois was very well done.  I was surprised by the voice casting -- I had anticipated loathing in particular Anne Heche's performance but was impressed -- she made a fine Lois.  The voice acting of Adam Baldwin and James Marsters was also superb.  I never would have cast them, but am very glad Andrea Romano did!
I look forward to seeing more one shots from this very imaginitive creative writing team.  Keep up the good work!  My husband and I both loved this, and I'm glad to finally be seeing good adult animation!",1192320000,,1086,4.668421052631579
2817378,4,B000PE0G0A,"It is worth a rental anyway, don't know that I'd buy it.  The Superman vs. Doomsday brawl is really only about 10-20 minutes and Doomsday is only in it for about 30, if that, but there are twists afterward, so know upfront that this isn't all about Superman vs. Doomsday.

I am surprised that this comes from the same people as JLU, Superman, and Batman as the drawing is totally different and Doomday is much more violent than I would have expected from those people, though I guess it is different going to DVD than to TV first.  On top of that,  even seems like they play off of Smallville a little bit.  In fact, Lois is even drawn somewhere betweeen Erica Durance and the Lois of JLU/Superman Adventures.  Superman seems a little more agile than the JLU/Superman versions and the battle looks like and athletic little guy against an indestructible hulk of a biker.  Lots of fun, senseless destruction with a Doomsday that doesn't talk or think.  A purebred animal of destruction.  Think of those animals on the Discovery channel that kill for no real reason, just to do it.  I didn't think that what Supes did to Doomsday would really hurt him and even before that, I thought he'd just throw him into the sun.  The way he ends the fight, shows he pretty much could have taken him there.

The main beefs I have with this is with the drawing of some of Superman and Lex.  Why did they decide to make Superman look so old and who decided that Lex should look like some metrosexual wuss?  And why did Mercy look a little like E.T. with nostrils and no nose?  On top of that, how is it that Toy Man now looks like Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons, but as a meth addict.",1192233600,2,1669,4.373376623376624
2817379,1,B000PE0G0A,"I'm not even sure I should be writing this review since I could only make it through about 10 minutes of this movie.  Nonetheless, I feel compelled to share my experience, which was extreme horror and disgust.

  I can't even begin to describe the shock and disbelief that waved over me upon the beginning of this ATROCITY.  Before I continue, let me say that I am not a comic book fan.  I have never read one nor do I plan to.  BUT I am nuts about the Warner Brothers-DC Comics cartoon series.  I was a faithful viewer of Batman, Batman/Superman, The Justice League, and JLU, and I've seen them all. While I'm only familiar with the characters from the TV series, I am well-versed in all of their storylines.  SO I am no stranger to them.

  My first problem with this movie are the actors they chose to do the voice work.  I don't think they could have done a WORSE job. I don't need to tell you that Superman's voice is supposed to be commanding, strong, and wise.  OR that Lex's voice is booming and dripping with disdain no matter WHO he talks to.  Well, apparantly the casting director of this monstrosity DOES need to be told because his choice was all wrong for EVERY character.  Anne Heche for Lois Lane??  Yuuuuck!

  Alright, so the voices suck.  Then the animation.  Superman looks like a gaunt old man and Lex looks like Lurch from the Addams Family -- tall, skinny, sickly-looking with a light-bulb-shaped head.  While they were the only two I really had a problem with, they are two of the main characters so it's more than enough to completely detract from the rest of the movie.

  I know that different stories exist to explain how Doomsday came about, but the one I am partial to is the one that claims he was born from Superman's own DNA to defeat the ""man of steel.""  This is NOT the story they decided to tell, and, while, it is just preference, it annoys me all the same.

  I cannot in good conscience allow any other fan of the Warner Brothers-DC Comics cartoon series to watch this.  This film was BEYOND disappointing.",1192233600,5,2045,4.445945945945946

Now if you are expecting to see the supermen, then you'll be dissappointed although it is a lot of fun watching the Superman Doomsday fight. The funeral was nice though it could have been longer. This is a good addition to the Superman films and shouldn't be counted out just because it doesn't follow panel by panel what you read in the comic. Also, take a peek at the extras with the team who came up with the story and see just how awesome it was to be around (or sad depending how you look at it) when Superman died!

2817389,1,B000PE0G0A,"I'm going sum up this review in bullets:

1: The beginning of the movie is weak.  Doomsday is found in a spaceship underground and a simple puncture in the hull causes him to immediately break free of the ship.  What was he doing all that time?  Was he sleeping?  Was he in suspended animation?  Was he watching Loony Toons?  We'll never know.

2. There are no other superheroes on earth.  Ahem, let me clarify that, THERE ARE NO OTHER SUPERHEROES ON EARTH.  A HUGE part of the success of the Death of Superman arc was the fact that no other superhero but Superman could stop Doomsday.  That gave the story an epic feel that is completely vacant here.  I felt nothing as Doomsday slaughtered weak little humans and animals on the way to Metropolis - another problem, by the way, as why has he chosen to go to Metropolis?  Give him a reason!

3.  Doomsday's evolution ability is missing.  And then this movie goes and actually suggests that Doomsday is a machine!  A FREAKING MACHINE!

4.  Doomsday is in this movie for 15 minutes max.  The movie should be titled SUPERMAN: NEMESIS as it is all about his clone and Lex Luthor.

5.  This Luthor isn't as smart as Luthor really is.  He only has ONE failsafe to stop the clone Superman.  Sloppy!

You dropped the ball on this one, creators.  Do yourself a favor and go watch the Justice League: Unlimited series.  You'll learn something about creating a movie about a character who exists in a world of heroes who love and respect him.  You'll learn something about the word ""epic"" and ""passion.""",1191974400,14,1542,4.529197080291971

So it's not exactly the same - who cares? (Well, I guess 1 star reviewers do.) I thought it was a great Superman story. My only gripe is the way the characters were drawn. I found their features too harsh and find them to be the worst I've seen in any of the other animated Superman DVDs I own. (One star lost for the harsh facial features.) The rest of the animation was very well done.

Just a note to parents with young Superman fans in the house (such as I have), this is not a movie for them. It deserves the PG-13 for both violence and language, as well as the implied nature of the relationship between Lois and Superman.",1191888000,5,812,4.205128205128205

Not only is the fight sequence amazing, but so is the fight at the end of the movie. Superman fights like nothing seen before on any of the animated shows.

The voive actors did an amazing job, especially Marsters as Luthor. I would definately recommend this to Superman enthusiasts or someone who is looking for a good movie to pass an hour.

I felt they could have focused more on the Doomsday character.

Someone else mentioned that it's like a two part story.  I agree.

I might have broken it up differently:

Part 1: The Origin Of Doomsday
Part 2: The Death Of Superman

Then leave everyone hanging on the edge wondering how the world will survive without Superman.

However I'm sure there were many factors that caused the creators to organize it as they did (I wasn't involved).

Hopefully when they convert this story into a real movie they will include those other things.

The animation is great.

Lois Lane has now been added to my list of the top 10 most beautiful women to ever appear in films.  That SOB Luthor tries to put the make on her while Supes is out of commmission.

I didn't watch the extra features on the dvd.

Amazon Unbox downloaded this movie to my Tivo right after it taped the introduction of Superman to The Batman cartoon series, the current anime-inspired version of Batman.  And to my surprise, all of the voice actors from the Justice League cartoon series were back in the Batman cartoon: George Newbern as the serious Superman, Dana Delaney as the sarcastic Lois Lane, and Clancy Brown as the debonair and devious Lex Luthor. With both on my Tivo, it was easy to make a comparison between the two animated depictions of Superman.

Warning: This review contains spoilers.  RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

The character designs have been altered a bit from the Superman animated series.  Superman (voiced by Adam Baldwin) has bizarrely drawn cheekbones in this movie.  Everyone else more or less looks the same, although Lex Luthor (voiced by James Marsters) is a ""white guy"" again; the Superman cartoon cast him as a Kojak-like darker skinned man who became progressively lighter skinned in each incarnation. Lois (voiced by Anne Heche, of all people) still looks like Lois, wearing impossibly short skirts and yet achieving an amazing range of athletic moves.  Three cheers for animated physics!

Superman: Doomsday really enjoys its PG-13-ness. People say funny cuss words like ""freaking,"" have relations, and die -- bloodlessly, but they still die. This is an animation for grown-ups, folks!

The voice actors do a suitable job.  Heche is actually the best of the bunch, providing a full range of emotions to Lois.  Adam Wylie is great as Jimmy Olsen, but I don't give him quite as much props as he's not exactly new to the DC animation universe (he's the voice of Brainiac 5 in Legion of Super-Heroes). The most egregious loss is Brown as Lex Luthor.  Clancy Brown's gravelly baritone has always given the character a subtle menace.  In Superman: Doomsday, Lex is just a bald guy with an attitude.

And thus we have the first of several problems with this movie. Lex is a one-dimensional villain bent on destroying Superman.  You know you're in trouble when you can make ""he's so evil..."" jokes. For example:

* Lex is so evil, he has the cure for cancer but doesn't share it with the world!
* He's so evil, he has a special room created just for beating up Superman!
* He's so evil, he shoots his own henchmen to cover up his operations!

Lex practically cackles his way through the entire series and is so patently unlikable that he hardly seems like an actual foil for Superman.  In fact, the only noteworthy contribution Lex contributes is his gripe that Superman was killed by an ""intergalactic soccer hooligan!"" I have to agree with him.

After a long, protracted fight with a goofy-looking muscle-bound gargoyle named Doomsday, Superman dies.

What made the death of Superman so important was the way the writers dealt with his death. Superman is as much a divine being and an iconic symbol as he is an alien who protects Earth; his death had emotional repercussions on the level of Elvis and Marilyn Monroe, and the comics made a point of showing what a world without Superman was like.  His death helped create Steel and Superboy and other heroes I didn't keep track of because I wasn't reading the comics at the time.

You won't find any of that here.  We have a few minutes of mourning, a few minutes of revelations (Lois knew Superman's identity, Lois meets Martha Kent, Lois and Superman were getting it on), and then Superman returns.  Only he's mean.

And so, Superman: Doomsday isn't just about Superman dying at the hands of a super villain - it's about Superman being the not-so-noble guy we always knew he could be.  This new, resurrected version acts with brutal efficiency.  That's most epitomized by his murder of the Toyman after Superman 2.0 discovers that Toyman escape from prison and killed a little girl in a hostage crisis.

There's a reckoning, of course: two Supermen battling it out, comparable to the Doomsday fight only with more blood and clever asides. And like the end of the movie, punch for punch, the old Superman (Animated Series) beats the new Superman (Doomsday), hands down.",1191456000,5,4322,4.824966078697422

I would have paid for sequels if it would have been done right. 2. Why does Superman have those stupid dimples on his face when he never had them before. I kept thinking, ""What the heck is that on his face?!"" 3. The character design for this movie was not what it should have been. Doomsday could have looked better...so much better! I'm an animator and I can tell you right now that the animation for this movie was also sub-par. It seemed rushed; maybe to make the deadline. I wouldn't be surprised if there was more of this movie we didn't get for sake of the deadline as well. I had to get used to the voice acting in a couple of scenes it seemed like it was totally off. All in all man, I was just sitting there at the end asking why. Why even bother? WB has the money, they should have spent more on this flick. I would have paid to see it in theaters or whatever, just do it right dagnabit! The WB's attempt to fight Marvel for top dawg of the animated powerhouses is off to an stoooopid start.

So I went into this film knowing it could be real bad. It would be tough to put the real whole storyline together in 75min. but I figured with some tweaking and even a lot of changes and trimming of unneeded storyline from the original story, it could be done. Well they screwed the pooch on this one, from supermans facial lines (he looked in his 50s Lois in her late 20s)to what happened to Doomsday. I mean where did he go? Wheres his body? The battle at night with barely anyone around! Not in the day when everyone is around and total chaos like in the original. There was no need for the change. Also there was no build up for Doomsday He just got loose, walked over a mountain and entered Metropolis. That and the fight with Superman was like 10 min. tops and then thats all we see of him.

2817406,4,B000PE0G0A,"I was prepared to be disappointed in this movie, but it really was very good. Of course, it didn't completely follow the original trilogy entitled Death of Superman, World Without a Superman, and Return of Superman.  If it had, the movie would have been at least three times longer than it was.  There was no Cyborg here or Super Boy or Steel.  Only the Eradicator was depicted by the ""bad"" Superman.  Bruce Timm and company took the famous story and included in their movie only what was really important to the story:  Doomsday kills Superman and Superman comes back to life, but not without some confusion to the people of Metropolis due to his evil double, who really isn't all that evil, just a little misguided.  If you call dropping the Toyman from 1,000 feet in the sky to his death misguided.  The Eradicator was my favorite Superman double in the stories, so I'm glad they he was the one they included in this movie.

One point regarding the Superman/Clark animation is that he had a weird cheekbone thing going on that was kind of distracting at first, but it grew on me as the movie progressed.  A big missing factor for me was no Batman or any of the other Justice Leaguers.  In the books, it showed how Superman's death affected Batman and the other super heroes.  For me, that would have enhanced the movie, but I can see why they left it out, for the sake of the continuity of the story.

All in all, it was a very good movie, just not as epic as the books were.  The animation's great, although it is much more violent than any other Bruce Timm venture, so be warned.  I would highly recommend this DVD to all Superman fans.",1190937600,5,1641,4.444816053511706

Where singer chose to make Superman a deadbeat dad of Steel and Lois a smoking single mother shacking up with Perry White's son, Bruce timm and animation team keep it simple, true to the mythology and pretty slick stuff. Kudos for some really nice animation and fluid movement: the exciting combination of that first season of BATMAN ANIMATED ADVENTURES mixed with a nice condensed Doomsday film. not quite the same comic year-long mega reading event, but a very satisfying popcorn movie provided that you crank up the sound and throw it on the biggest screen possible.

2817422,1,B000PE0G0A,"The DC comics Doomsday/World without Superman/Return storyline was an epic that kept readers gripped for years. It saw the rise of an iconic monster who walked from the west to the east coast of America pounding the crappola out of anything he came across on the way. The Justice League and various other heroes tried to stop him and fell. In the end it came down to just Superman and Doomsday and we saw why the big blue boyscout is the worlds greatest hero.

This movie has none of that. The fight between Supes and Doomsday is executed without a hint of drama and is totally devoid of character or any of the iconic moments captured within the original comics.

Superman himself is a freakish shadow of himself and his relationship with Lois is both lacking in any feeling and weird. Why is he dating her as Superman and making disparaging comments about Clark? Surely it makes more sense to date her as Clark and then do the moment he reveals he's superman. Bring the characters together before you split them apart. (as they did in the comics) Lots of post-coiltal sitting around in dressing gowns but no sense that there is anything between the characters. Jimmy Olsen (who got the money shot of a dead superman in the comics and became a world renown photographer for it) is a complete non-entity as are all the supporting characters and even Superman himself. (I don't think Adam Baldwin changes the tone of his voice once throughout the whole movie).

The Doomsday bits are bad enough but what happens after is just appalling. A rubbish storyline about a superman clone. It would've made more sense to go for a trilogy and actually try to follow the comics rather than rush out this hackneyed bullhicky. Also would've made more sense to hire the guys who do the new Batman TV series to do the art as Supes seems to have something wrong with his face with those cheekbones and beady eyes.

All in all a very poor attempt at one of DC biggest storylines. Again Warner Bros proves they just can't do a proper, contemporary Superman. While Bruce Timm may have done a spanking job on the original Batman animated show, he's proven once again that he can't write Superman for love nor money. This is the worlds greatest hero (in the DCU) and by now WB should have learned, if you want to make money from this franchise (and some decent movies) you need to stick to the source and play the man for who he really is.

2817438,2,B000PE0G0A,"I remember when I was 10 in 1993, when the ""Death of Superman"" shocked the world. I got the comic, which I still have along with ""Funeral for a Friend"", ""Return of the Supermen"" and ""Hunter Prey"". Those books captured the heroism, courage, adversity and triumph of Superman. Now we know that the DVD could not capture everything the comics did but it could have been more thoroughly written. Let's take a look as to why this DVD failed:

1. Length of Battle With Doomsday-In the original comic, Superman battles Doomsday for an entire day and died at 6:23 P.M. Now we know the DVD could not have 6 plus hours of fighting but the length of the battle was ridiculous. The action was great but it lacked like many have already said, a dramatic/epic finish. When Superman dies in Lois's arms, none of the other onlookers seem to have much emotion and just ""stand there"". There is no ambulance or no one trying to recuperate him. Apparently, money was a reason the film was short, so why not just have the battle between Doomsday and Superman to last for at least 40-55 minutes and include the funeral for the remainder to leave us waiting for a sequel after a year or so? After all the title does include Superman/Doomsday. Then they could spend another 75 minutes on the ""Return of the Supermen"". I felt that the love story between Superman and Lois could have been reduced for other important elements.

2. Cardboard People That Lacked Emotion-The character models looked unnatural and cold. There was a huge lack of natural emotion, like they were used to just fill in space. Even when there was grieving it felt fake. The animation overall was just lacking, although some of it was good. If I watch a movie, I want to have a connection with the characters so that I can remember them............in this movie this was not so. Why did they include a homosexual theme when Luther told Superman,"" who's your daddy""?

3. Music Score-It could have been better but there should have been better more dramatic music accompanying the fight between Superman and Doomsday.

I feel bad for so many of you who make excuses for this film. I know that you want to love this film, thus feeling compelled to make allowances for its shortcomings. Read the comics instead which would be ""Death of Superman"", ""Funeral for a Friend"" and ""Return of the Supermen"". To those who are curious to watch it, rent it, or wait for a price reduction. This movie had potential but it just did not cut it. Even if it is an adaption , it is no excuse for the lack of effort put into this film. I guess some of you will praise any product with the Superman shield on it no matter how bad it is.

Too bad they did not get it right, for a properly written battle between Superman and Doomsday should make you come to tears. I doubt it if they will ever put Doomsday on the big screen so now we shall await to see if the sequel to ""Superman Returns"" will feature a cool villain or villains.",1190678400,2,2953,4.481412639405204

The story was completely rewritten for absolutely no reason. They completely could have done it right and it should have then been a 2 and a half hour movie. Why not put the effort in? Why not make a valid attempt?

They completely destroyed what was and is one of the greatest story lines in comic book history.

For those that don't know the original story line, I feel bad for because this will be the only story they know, and it will be a pathetic one.

The Man of Steel, learning of the destruction and deaths in Metropolis, takes it upon himself to take the monster down before more lives are lost.

The battle is epic.

The action is huge.

The consequences are dire.

Superman fails, falls...

Dies.

Adapted from the biggest and most shocking comic book story of all time, Superman: Doomsday is the emotional and action-packed tale of the life, death and return of the world's greatest superhero.

This story is dark, and not just because Superman dies. This isn't a kids cartoon. The themes are mature (i.e. Lois half-naked in the Fortress of Solitude), Lex Luthor, distraught over Superman's absence in his own weird way, is the most evil Lex ever seen in a cartoon and the things he does at some points in the film make you go, ""Man, that's evil. Not just evil. HUGELY evil.""

What was most astonishing was the swearing. I never would have expected that from a Superman cartoon.

On the plus side, the battle between Superman and Doomsday is the greatest slugfest this reviewer has ever seen in a superhero cartoon (and I've seen nearly all of them). The story is solid and packs a lot in given the amount of time Warner Brothers seems to allow for these direct-to-DVD cartoons of theirs.

The animation is dynamic, the coloring bold, the art in the style of the Justice League cartoons.

This DVD includes a few special features, most notably the enthralling documentary on the life, death and return of Superman, chronicling the death saga from conception to fruition, with interviews with the many artists and writers and editors on the project.

direct-to-DVD movies, I was excited. Though Marvel has been doing a pretty good job. The only movie that's really enjoyable from Marvel animations is Doctor Strange. Anyway to continue, DC's animation is alot better than some of the crap Marvel's put out. So I lay in wait of the first film: Superman Doomsday. So when I poped it in my DVD player I wasn't expecting it to be completely faithful. It did a pretty good job of adapting the graphic novel, but I did have some complants, though not many. 1. The title: The thing that really bothered me was how short the Doomsday conflict was. I mean he showed up and he and Superman fought for about 10 or 12 minutes and then they both die. So I think the title sould've been Attack of the Clone or something because to me that's what the real conflict was, Superman vs. Superman. 2. Character designs: Now this complant is very small, some of the characters from an angle to me looked wierd, mostly Lex. So, that's about it, I do recommened this title for any comic fan or DC animation fan. It's good and overall I liked it. So what are you waiting for? Buy it!",1190592000,,1168,4.387096774193548
2817446,2,B000PE0G0A,"This film was a colossal disappointment. I found the animation uncomfortable and difficult to watch, although this is my own personal preference - I don't care for the way this particular Superman, and all the people, are drawn. They appear to be an amalgamation of building, or cinder blocks. It's just not attractive. Louis is so angular she barely possesses any humanity. There isn't any spark or interest between her and Superman; and in a Superman film, be it animation or live action, there absolutely has to be a spark between Lois and Clark/Superman. Superman is already at a disadvantage as a character, because he's so darn powerful, and his morals and integrity are unquestionable. He's the perfect guy. That's why it's difficult to tell stories about him, as opposed to Batman, for whom telling stories isn't as difficult. He's fallible - physically and morally. Superman has two essential weaknesses: Kryptonite and Lois. How many does Batman have? Ask any writer who they'd rather write stories for, and 9 times out of ten you're going to hear ""Batman"".

Why this particular Superman ""realization"" was chosen for this film is anyone's guess. If it was in the special features, I missed it. The special features weren't subtitled, and as I'm hearing impaired, I don't bother with special features that aren't subtitled. (Really - how much money are we talking about to add subtitles or captions to special features?)

But my disappointment goes far beyond the animation, and is more solidly found in the story itself. The death of Superman, and his return, as told in the actual comic books, were incredible stories by themselves. The only editing required would have been to cut scenes. It wasn't necessary to bring Lex Luthor in and rewrite 90% of the story, especially when the story they came up with was so insipid. My best guess for the inclusion of Luthor was mass appeal. More people know who Luthor is than Doomsday, so perhaps they were banking on Luthor's involvement raising the stakes for those who might not have read the initial series. Again, though, why do *anything* if what your doing detracts from the story? The story is about Superman, Doomsday, and Superman's return. They should have stuck to their original story. They didn't need Supergirl or the Justice League (part of the story 14 years ago). Those scenes could have been cut, and still given them plenty to work with.

The actual fight between Superman and Doomsday was remarkably dull, and mostly because they cut Superman's thoughts out. In the comic strip, Superman was shown thinking about how devastating Doomsday was, and how much he, Superman, was hurting. To show how badly Superman is being hurt, especially through his own thoughts (it's more specific that way than a simple ""OOMF"", or a facial expression of pain) would have added very necessary drama to the scene in the film.

I followed this series week-by-week as it was released in the early 90s. The creators had to find a creature capable of killing Superman (without resorting to a tired Kryptonite-based plot), and they brilliantly invented the character of Doomsday, who was fleshed out even more in a later graphic novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Doomsday-Hunter-Prey/dp/1563892014/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey</a>). It still ranks as one of the more exciting reads that I can recall, and I'm not necessarily a comic book fan.

When I first read the comic book that killed Superman, I admit to being choked up when he died. The writers did such a terrific job at building the scene and setting the necessary emotions, I doubt I could have done anything but be choked up. When Superman died in this animated film, I felt like yawning. And it was pretty much the same for when he came back.
About coming back: he came back to fight a genetically engineered Superman (being controlled, partially at least, by Luthor), and came back in a black suit with solar panels to increase his absorption of the yellow sun. Did anyone else notice that the fight between Superman and his clone occurred at night? The least they could have done is waited until the sun rose.

2817459,3,B000PE0G0A,I saw it and it was alright.  It could have followed the original story line and include both superboy and steel and they did have enough time to do so since this was only an hour and seventeen minutes...it would help with the climatic battle scene where the man of steel could have used some help.  I do 'preciate the producers wanting a more cerebral storyline with Lois and the dark premise of the film to allow it to be more realistic that a saturday cartoon and I would buy it for my collection.

2817460,1,B000PE0G0A,"I've never read the original DC comics regarding Superman's death so I came into this movie without bias.  I hate giving it a 1-star rating but it just wasn't very good.  The animation was on par with Saturday morning cartoons, the voice acting (with the exception of James Marsters) was unemotional and stale and the violence relatively tame for a PG-13 movie.  After the movie ended I was left wondering, ""That's all?  That's all the fuss was about?""

2817461,3,B000PE0G0A,"First, let me just say that I consider myself a very conservative Superman fan. Therefore, when I heard that DC was releasing (in my opinion) the greatest Superman story ever in an animated format on DVD, I was a bit unrealistically hopeful. I hoped they would stay true to the origianl story: the appearance of the mysterious Doomsday, the involvement of the JLA, Superman's death, Jonathan Kent's heart attack and his journey into the afterlife to bring his son back, the arrival of the 4 Supermen, the betrayal of the Cyborg Superman and his alliance with Mongul, the destruction of Hal Jordan's Coast City, and finally the sacrifice of the Eradicator, bringing about the return of our beloved Man of Steel. I say unrealistic because, deep down, I knew they wouldn't be able to fit all of that into a 75 minute direct to DVD movie.

Once I got past the fact that the after-death story of Superman: Doomsday was extremely off-beat, I was satisfied with the movie. I was happy with the voice acting (the script seemed a bit rushed in some places but otherwise it was good), the animation was superb as usual, and the overall story made sense for what it was.

One thing I was NOT happy about was the fact that Lois did not know Clark was Superman until the very end of the movie. the love affair going on between Lois and Superman (not Clark) was the worst part of the movie. Jonathan Kent was no where to be seen (I guess we were supposed to assume he was dead) and Martha Kent seemed all alone and a little disjointed.

As I already said, this movie was good for what it was. However, I wish they could have put a little effort into it as far as the Doomsday story went. A 2 or 3 parter would have done better, I feel. It was a good movie for first-timers or fans who were not around for Superman's death in the early 90's, but for hardcore, die-hard fans, prepared to be disappointed.",1190505600,3,1888,4.435158501440922
2817462,2,B000PE0G0A,"Hi all,

Like everybody else I picked up the eventful comics that made up the death of superman storyline way back then and it was a huge thing.

Today we get to see an animated version of these events and here is my review.

Pros

Nice animation
Nice character design
Very good voice acting.
Intense fights and destruction.

Cons

Most of the movie happens at night. I have no clue as to why though. I guess the moviemaker got a deal on black ink for the film production.

The biggest problem I have with this DVD adaptation is with the story. The only thing that remains from the original comic book story is the fight with doomsday and the death and funeral of superman. Everything else in the film before and after doomsday is made up fiction for the film.

I really did not like the way Doomsday was handled in the film. The movie is called Superman Doomsday and you are lead to believe that this is the story while in fact it is really not the case.

Yes there is this big huge fight which is extremely well done. But after superman apparently kills doomsday and dies soon after, we have no clue as to what happens to doomsday after. There is not one second of the film that shows how people dealt with doomsday...did they dispose of him? Where did doomsday go? I have no clue!  The storyline switches to a clone of superman story, the resurrection of superman and that is it.

That has got to be the worst written bit of animation history that I have ever seen and they had the base material to write from.  Doomsday beats superman like he was a rag doll nearly kills him and then in the end he just disappears entirely from the film.

I was not happy with that at all. Very poor story telling technique.

I would recommend to people to rent it and only hardcore comic book fan to buy it but take it with a grain of salt as it is not really good.

2817463,4,B000PE0G0A,"I hate to begin this review on a negative note but I have to say something to all the comic purists out there tearing down this movie....CAN IT!! Just about every review I read about this latest Timm-verse installment harps on the differences between this movie and the original comic. First of all, comic characters and their stories are always being re-invented in movies, tv shows and YES even the comics themselves. If Superman himself was still the man he was in 1938 I doubt anyone would be buying his books much less an animated dvd. My second point is that for those of you that are actually fans of Bruce Timm's previous work, THIS IS NOTHING NEW!! Timm has been putting his own spin (as well as the spin of many others) on Batman, Superman and the JLA since the early 90s!! Just about every villan and storyline from the Joker to Lex Luthor to Doomsday has been re-imagined in his shows and movies. Now for those of you who still want to cling to the details of this DVD I beg you to listen to the DVD commentary provided where Timm directly addresses why certain changes were made to the storyline and the characters. Finally, even if you couldn't stand the film itself this DVD is worth the 12-15 bucks just for the documentary about the original Death of Superman comic.",1190419200,4,1283,4.510729613733906
2817464,2,B000PE0G0A,"First I must say that Superman Doomsday animation was not that all impressive given the fact that the ""Death of Superman"" was the best selling graphic novel of all time till to this day.  The animation style was a notch above Justice League Unlimited.  More time and effort should have been given to this film maybe ""Superman Returns"" did not make enough money to budget for a more indepth story.  Though this was an animated film it kept you interested because it had real emotion and action.  I look at Marvel live action films and their animated films and I see why they are slaughtering DC when it comes to putting out films. DC tried with this film and it was a good start but more time and better animation.
I call this the first real Superman movie of the 21st Century because its modern not watered down like Superman Returns.  Superman actual fought a real villian on his level without being weaked by Kryptonite.  The fight scene was brillant this what adult fans of Superman want to see in a live action film.  Bryan Singer needs to take notes or WB needs to get another director period.  Things I would do to make the death of Superman better is first....use Anime style of animation, thirdly develop it in a 3 2 hour part series, lastly have it a rated R rating for realism then truly you will have a winner.",1190419200,3,1321,4.452282157676349
2817465,5,B000PE0G0A,"This is one brutal film, and I doubt if it would air uncensored on Cartoon Network due to violence (the body count goes up; yes, PEOPLE DIE), language and hints at adult themes. Everyone knows the storyline by now so I won't go into that. To be honest Adam Baldwin as Superman and Anne Heche as Lois Lane did much better than I expected. James Marsters was lethal as Lex Luthor (Clancy Brown is THE animated Luthor but Marsters gives Lex a different but superb portrayal).This is what an updated SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES/JUSTICE LEAGUE (UNLIMITED) would look like, and it does keep much of the style of its predecessors.
On the extras front, there are brief interviews with Baldwin and Heche, but no Marsters, which is a shame. Still highly recommended, especially for all fans of DCAU.",1190419200,3,791,4.739130434782608

2817468,4,B000PE0G0A,"In a way Superman: Doomsday is better than Superman Returns even. Superman Returns had too much of a similar plot as the original Superman. Superman: Doomsday is a lot more fresh and even more exciting. It starts off with Lex Corp finding a dangerous alien being named Doomsday. He starts causing havoc everywhere and he's so strong that Superman can barely take him. Also Lois is with Superman but he still won't even admit to her that he's Clark Kent as well eventhough she finds it pretty obvious.

  Superman has a brutal fight with Doomsday and neither survive. This leaves mankind with no protector. That is until Superman suddenly returns but this Superman handles the law with violence. Which leads Lois and Martha Kent to thinking he's really not Superman. Lex Luther cloned him out of madness since he is very disapointed that it wasn't him who killed Superman. But is the real Superman really dead and will he return to save mankind from the evil Superman ?

  The movie is surprisingly dark and violent and even has some vulgarity so parents might want to consider if they let their kids watch it or not. It's well made though and is easily superior to any of Marvel's made for video Ultimate Avengers movies. It's better done than Superman Returns and thank god he has no kid here. I also liked the voice acting of Adam Baldwin (Serenity) as Superman, Anne Heche (Psycho...the remake) as Lois Lane and James Marsters (Spike in Buffy and Brainiac in Smallville) as Lex Luther.

2817471,1,B000PE0G0A,"I hate it when they allow projects like this to occur. The original story was what made it so popular. Then you have a writer come along and think they can do a better job at telling the story, and you end up with this garbage.

First of all, the Doomsday was in the movie for about ten minutes. Then it was the evil clone of Superman for the rest of the movie as the villain. So it really shouldn't have been named Superman/Doomsday.

The worst part of it is, they missed so much of the essence of ""Death of Superman"" in this telling. When they first told the story, Doomsday decimated the Justice League, and left them in ruins. Superman was faced with a choice he'd never been faced with before. For the first time, he knew he had to kill Doomsday in order to save everyone. This was almost as powerful a revelation as dying--a hero realizing that sometimes the cost must be this high. Not just your life, but taking another life. It took time for Superman to have to work up to this. That was great story telling.

The disappointment of this movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I will be very hesitant to purchase the next DC Movie project. It's just as disappointing as Singer's ""Superman Returns""",1190332800,6,1204,4.366071428571429

I don't think it's possible to translate the whole story from the graphic novel form to video, but the producers did a good job here. Thing is, this isn't ""Justice League Unlimited""; although you don't see much blood, the intimations of violence, death (some graphic, especially for kids,) and other, more deeply psychological themes, makes this a step up from the usual kids show fare. I recommend this for a watch and for collections; it does fair justice to a really strong story. One point worth mentioning is the unusual voice casting; James Marsters from ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" as Luthor (he plays him really evil here,) Anne Heche as Lois Lane and Adam Baldwin, most notably from ""Firefly"" as Superman/Clark.

The violence is over the top and very inappropriate. I know it's PG-13 but kids are going to watch it and there are like several grisly murders that happen just ""off camera"". You know they were thinking how much can we get away with and still be PG-13. Parents beware. Definitely not for kids. Right to lifers beware.

I grew up with George Reeves as Superman and every screen adaptation since and have learned not to compare but judge each on its own merit. I watched this on a 110 inch projection screen  and was pleased that this had very much a theatrical feel. The animation is excellent, colors are vibrant, backgrounds are very detailed and have depth. Multiple camera angles are used to the fullest. The template used for the face of Superman seems a little overdone and at the same time simplistic. This detracts a little from the fluidness of the rest of the animation which is otherwise topnotch. I had no problem with the voice acting, I like the actors from the TV show, but I am also partial to Bud Cuyler who did the voice on the 60's cartoon...time to move on.
I enjoyed the movie and because I have not read the book version was surprised by the turns the story took. That seems to be the deciding factor on this, if you go in without any preconceived notions you'll have a good chance of enjoying yourself.

As the story progresses she begins to fit the character almost effortlessly, this is very much necessary because after the doomsday fight this superman movie becomes lois lane's movie all the way to the end.  That is probably the most disappointing aspect of this film is the ending, instead of superman coming back to stop a superman level threat, he returns to fight his evil clone which is kinda anti climatic in the way it plays out, the main focus of the ending is superman restoring his relationship with lois.

I am a big fan of Superman/Batman.  I have the Death of Superman/World without Superman/Return of Superman comics.

This version of the story is very poorly done in my opinion.  Now I don't care if they followed the story from the comic exactly. But this was just a poor production on its own.  If your not going to follow the storyline from the comic, then at least come up with something of quality.

The whole story was just rushed.  If they wanted to give this story any justice they could of done it over a 2-3 movies. The death, the world without, and the return.  But this whole movie stinks of greed over quality, like they said ""Let's get something out quick for some quick cash!"".

Parts of it had some quality, most of the fight scene between Doomsday and Superman was pretty good.  But the whole Lois/Superman part was just blah..  The Superman clone stuff was blah..  Superman's return was blah..
For anyone who didn't read the comic version, there is nothing here that makes a viewer mourn or cheer when Superman returns.  What can I say, it's all just blah...

The art work was pretty bad as well.
The lines they drew under Superman's eyes bugged me the whole movie. His face was very poorly done.

I was really hoping for the same voices from the Justice League, but know this is not always possible. Not even a single other hero appeared in the scenes of Superman's funeral. Booo

I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but the most hardcore Superman fans. But only then so we could share in bashing of how poorly done this movie was overall.

On a side note, I wish Superman writers (comics, movies, and tv) would come up with a consistent story on whether Jonathan Kent is alive of dead.",1190332800,5,1755,4.503164556962025

It was so bad and cheesy. So it was more violent, not kid friendly but it wasn't enough to even make it ok. Doomsday as the villian felt like Bane in the horrible Batman & Robin movie from the 90's.  Ann Heche as Lois Lane?  OMG her voice drove me nuts along with the horrible voice acting. It was so confusing to watch and hear her voice! And why change the artwork that Bruce Timm had done with the Animated Series? What's with the dimples and facial lines on Superman, Lois and Lex?  Horrible. The story was rushed and drastically condensed and it's a shame.  I can't believe DC would release this. I'm going to watch my Superman Animated series now to wash the bad taste in my mouth from this Doomsday-lite.

First of all if you are doing an animated movie based on one of if not THE most popular comic book stories of all time wouldn't you try and follow that a little closer.  It was like they never read the graphic novel at all.  I realize that in order to do a movie length version of a comic book certain things might be left out or redone but this is a completely different story for the comic books.  And the animation is laughable.  I think the Saturday morning cartoons that I grew up with were drawn better than this.  I think DC had better think about cutting loose the animation teams that the currently have and try and get the ones that work for Marvel.  See the Ultimate Avengers or Doctor Strange and then watch this movie and you will see what I am talking about.  To sum up if you want to experience the Death of Superman, go buy the comics or graphic novel and paint the images on the canvas of your mind.

Gone are the side stories about Superboy and Steel, which were very cool IMHO.  Gone also is the interesting story about how Superman came back to life.  The mechanics behind how he does so in this DVD are completely different, from what I recall.

2817492,3,B000PE0G0A,"The whole idea of putting Superman's death on video is great, but the video itself is a bit different from the comic books. For those who never read the Death of Superman, then this would be a decent story worthy of 4 stars.

The only problem with this is that Doomsday is just thrown into the movie, with no background into the character or how he was created. Additionally his story here is different from the comic books. Doomsday was apparently buried a few miles underneath Earth thousands of years ago, rather than being from Krypton and genetically modified to resist things that have killed him (he ressurects).

There doesn't seem to be a main storyline in this movie other than the death of Superman (even how he dies is altered from the comic book). The battle with Doomsday is only a few minutes long and it seems like it's only a side story rather than the main dish. The Reign of Supermen part is left out and replaced with Luthor's numerous clones (though there is only one clone that is active). There is a hint that the clone itself turns out to be Bizarro (due to the lightning effects), but ultimately dies.

There are really two main battles, Doomsday vs. Superman and Clone Superman vs. Superman (though this one is in a weakened state from the fight with Doomsday). The romance scenes are a bit cheesy and the voice acting is decent, though if they are going to use Bruce Timm's animation style...they should at least have the original voice actors.

Speaking of the animation, it is a bit different from the animated series. It is slightly more detailed and Superman is given an older look with wrinkle lines drawn on his face. The Toyman makes an appearance (but is ruthlessly killed by the clone Superman) in a angst teenager look as opposed to a adolescent-like nutcracker. But other than that there are no other Supervillians besides Lex.

The story itself seems rushed and could have used another 30 minutes as it felt much shorter than the listed 75 minutes. The extras themselves are really not worth viewing, but despite the flaws in story this is still a decent movie with plenty of action. Despite the PG-13 rating, the movie is not really that graphic (that is, Doomsday's rampage is a lot of bone breaking, but no blood...and most of it is done out of screen).

This is a good movie, but not worth the $15 that most places sell it for. $7 is probably a fair price for this movie, given its short length and lack of significant extras.",1190246400,,2469,4.587301587301587

Overall I was really disappointed with the treatment of the death of Supeman, but it was not based on the visual merits of the film, which in and of themselves are done very well. PS to the creators: Superman has HEAT vision, not lazer vision, therefore there would have been no bouncing off of a mirror to create the ""extraction"" scene.

This version of the story is utter garbage, and basically deconstructs the storyline into a mess to fit it into a 75 minute slot. Even the version of Doomsday that was done on Justice League Unlimited was a better idea than this. The story missed so much of what was needed to make it effective. Mainly that it fought the JLA first, and trashed them before even meeting Superman. I was trying to think of a plus, but it just isn't happening. Even the animation was substandard, and I loved the previous animated series. Superman Doomsday just misses so many marks.

Those people need to get out a dictionary and look up the meaning of the word, ""Adaptation."" The epic comic book tale, featuring four (rather than one) surrogate Supermen, Supergirl, a somewhat different Lex Luthor and guest appearances by the Justice League as well as the additional villain Mongul would be impossible to do in a 75 minute movie.

Different media have different needs and what Bruce Timm and his team have done is create a great story that captures the spirit of the comics while bringing some entirely new twists.  Some of the changes (such as sending Clark to Afghanistan at the beginning of the story, thus making his unexplained silence after Superman dies easier to explain) are improvements on the original. Other alterations offer some really surprising twists to the fans who do know the story (one, including a terrifyingly redesigned Toyman will have true Superman fans gasping). And most of all, the relationship between Superman and Lois has never been handled with such depth and complexity... it offers some genuine emotion at a number of points in the film.

The action is great, the voices are mostly excellent (although Anne Heche's gruff Lois takes a while to get used to) and it's fun to see how the animators have integrated elements from many sources, including SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (there's a shot of Supes taking off that's lifted directly from the film), SMALLVILLE and SUPERMAN RETURNS (Jonathan Kent isn't alive in this and Martha seems to have the same kind of melancholic disconnect to her son as in that film). Of course, small nods to comics creators are in evidence and there's even an inside dig at producer Jon Peters' infamous edict to have Superman battle a giant spider (voiced by an animated Kevin Smith).

The film's not perfect... one wishes that the Doomsday portion of the film would've had just a tad more heft to it, and a subplot involving Jimmy Olsen being wooed by a Tabloid feels forced, but those are minor quibbles.

The plethora of added bonus features, including an in-depth look at the hysteria that the original ""Death of Superman"" comics wraught, make this a must-have for even a casual Superman fan. Pay the One and Two Star Reviewers no mind! They're too wrapped up in their myopic fanboy worlds to appreciate this project for what it is: An exciting, adult Superman adventure that easily stands on its own.",1190246400,12,2591,4.852941176470588

So I went to work Tuesday and as soon as I got drove to Blockbuster and tried to rent Superman/Doomsday.  No rental copies!!! I paid 16.99 for the movie and went straight home.  I have been excited about movie since learning that it was being released.  I own all the comic books leading to the death, funeral for a friend, reign of the supermen,  and the return of superman for a year forward.  I also bought and read the novel this movie was based on the week it came out.  This is my favorite comic storyline ever.

HUH?

I can only guess the makers of this movie hated the original storyline.  The trailers made it seem like the storyline would be followed, The back of the dvd didn't mention it was basically ""Ultimate Superman""  I would have watched the movie regardless I would have liked it more if I had known what I was going to see.  Here is what is not in this movie from comic books

-Any other heroes
-Doomsday original entrance, not even the dead bird.
-Double punch death
-reign of supermen
-Coast City
-pretty much after he dies the only thing that remains true to comics is he comes back

The writers seem to get excited about the fact they could kill people and curse and forgot to remain true to the fans.

The makers of the trailers for the movie remained true to the fans and may have not watched the movie after the first 30 minutes.

I did enjoy the documentary on the actual story. I watched it before the movie to pump me up and that was a bad lead in on the story that was shown.",1190246400,5,1547,4.301038062283737

Without a doubt DC comics are the best superhero animated stories to date, and this film is no exception.
First off this story is a separate entity from the original Superman or JLA series.
That had me confused at first, but I caught on real quick.
A very dark and violent tale with some great fight scenes, and an all new look for the characters, one villain ( who I always hated in JLA) has been redone in a suprising and very disturbing way.

When Lex Luthor unearths the intergalactic monster Doomsday, Superman is locked in a devastating battle against the powerful brute that forces him to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect the people of Metropolis. As the world mourns the death of its greatest hero, Superman mysteriously returns darker and more aggressive than before. ""Superman: Doomsday"" is an amusing 75-minute animated adaptation of the best selling graphic tale ""The Death of Superman"". For the most part, the story holds out pretty well and includes some memorable moments. The raging battle between Superman and Doomsday is fiercer and more engrossing than anything seen in the previous animated series. The animated adventure features the voice talents of Adam Baldwin (Serenity), Anne Hache (Men in Trees) and James Marsters (Buffy the Vampire Slayer).

""Superman: Doomsday"" is a well recommended DVD for any serious comic book fan. The 75-minute animated movie is presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format.

Having bought the complete graphic novel when it was originally released, I thought the DVD would be great. I am just let down that Superman's death came so quick (about 25 minutes in). I think it would have been much better if had ended with the defeat of Doomsday and the Death of Superman. It just seemed to me like the writers were more focused on the events after Superman's death and his resurrection instead of the events leading up to it.

Perry White: ""Who cares? He's kicking Superman's a%%!""

Back in the early '90s, the comic book industry got a massive shot in the arm with the Death of Superman, and it was an impressive undertaking indeed, involving the tight integration of the four Superman titles. And after Supes died saving the world from Doomsday, the stories got even better. DC unveiled the heartfelt Funeral for a Friend arc, followed by the mysterious fake Supermen, then the cherry on top, the ultimate return of the true Man of Steel. However, SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY, DC's inaugural straight-to-dvd animated movie, takes drastic short cuts and liberties and in the end proves to be a head-shaking letdown.

Understandably, this film, at a running time of 75 minutes, is unable to incorporate all the story arcs in the Death of Superman, World Without a Superman, and the Return of Superman volumes. So no room for the Eradicator, Superboy, Cyborg, or Steel. And certainly no room for Green Lantern's abrupt inclusion and the total devastation of Coast City. We do get the relentless and single-minded Doomsday, Lex Luthor, and Toyman for villains, and one other. But compared to the excitement, breadth and emotion of the comic books it shoddily adapted, this film is found decidedly wanting.

I did find two things to take solace from. Item one: I tremendously enjoyed the two sprawling, epic, minutes-long Metropolis punchfests which bookmark the film, wherein Superman severely gets his caped arse handed to him. The second thing I liked, the hefty special features. We get an audio commentary worth listening to by the filmmakers (including Bruce Timm); the in-depth 43-minute-long ""Requiem and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" featurette which covers the Death of Superman comic book phenomenon and offers interviews with the four main writers of that stretch (several of whom get teary-eyed on camera); a teaser of the very promising Justice League: New Frontier film, based on Darwyn Cooke's mini-series; Behind the Voice featurette (5 minutes); and the ""Superman's Last Stand"" game. I'm stoked on Justice League: New Frontier.

No complaints with the animation on this film, or the pulverizing fight scenes, or the interpretation of Superman as a darker, more self-righteous, and vindictive hero. Those were the good points, and I even appreciated the more mature tone taken by this film. There are some serious moments of violence here, as perpetrated by Doomsday and a sterner Man of Steel. But the movie lost me in between the all-out brawls, because that's where the film really drags.

I've always found Lex Luthor to be a boring villain. Sadly, there's heavy emphasis on him and his frustration of having his long-schemed revenge on Superman being now forever denied him. Thus, he indulges in lackey beatdowns and a mercy killing. It doesn't help that Luthor is voiced by James Marsters, whose peevish tones are definitely inferior to the majestic, mellifluous Clancy Brown. Then there's the dreary sub-plot of Jimmy Olsen taking a new job at a sleaze rag. Who cares? It must be noted, however, that there are touches of sincerity in Lois Lane and Martha Kent's grieving. Anne Heche as Lois seems okay, but, dang it, I'm just so used to Dana Delaney. I must say, though, that I'm perfectly fine with Adam Baldwin as Superman.

SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY was something I had to get, me being a fan of the Death of Superman stories. I'm not gonna say I regret having purchased this as I don't believe the film was a total loss. But, yes, it could've - should've - been much better. This is the first time Bruce Timm's disappointed me with his stuff. May it be the last. Two and a half stars for this one.

I was a little disappointed that that was not what we got.  I still think it would be reall hard to do all of that in one 90 minute movie and do it justice.  However, for what it is, it is very well done.  But why no Pa Kent?  Maybe I need to listen to the commentary next time.  Unfortunately, we do not get to hear any commentary from the writers of the comic; only those of the people behind the movie.

2817503,2,B000PE0G0A,"What can I say, publicity ploy or not, I bought into the whole Death and Life of Superman story arc in 1992-93. I had really never read comics with a passion until they introduced Doomsday and all the fury he unleashed upon the world of Superman. It was a spellbinding series of events that kept me waiting for each and every installment of the story until it was finished. I read the novel, I played the SNES game, I lived for this stuff.

Since those days in the early 90's, I've glamored for a cinematic version of the death of Superman. Unfortunately, that wait was met with this sub par rehashing of an incredible story. Rehashed to the point where there's barely anything left to enjoy from the original plot.

I can't say I was expecting a scene for scene replica of all of the comics (that would end up being something along the lines of a trilogy if they really wanted to do it) but I DID want something more than this. It's a brutal, violent, and hollow Superman movie. At points the brutality went way overboard. (Which seems to be something they were proud of as my DVD has a sticker proclaiming this the ""First PG-13 animated Superman movie"")

Yes, Doomsday was a brutal and remorseless being. No, this animated violence couldn't capture what the comics gave us: a true feeling of helplessness as this strange creature mowed through superheroes like they were nothing. It's sad Doomsday was used as nothing more than a set piece for the rest of the broken events of this adaptation.

As for the return of Superman, again, this version fails miserably to capture the essence of the comics. I know they couldn't have run with the original 4 Supermen returning (Son of Krypton, Superboy, Steel, and the Eradicator), but making the decision to have Lex Luthor heavily involved with the climax was a poor choice. Why not just run with the cyborg angle of it? Keep SOME of what we all loved.

In the end, people who haven't read the original story arc might enjoy this more. If you're reading this review and you haven't, I highly suggest you spend your money on getting the graphic novel as opposed to this poorly animated and adapted version of Superman. They really dropped the ball as far as I'm concerned.",1190160000,2,2217,4.588383838383838
2817504,3,B000PE0G0A,"It's not horrible. The animation is great, but the story is very week. I'm a fan of Superman and Bruce Timm. Don't get me wrong, the movie is entertaining, but the lackluster script fails to impress me. If you are a fan of Superman the Animated series or the Justice League/Justice League Unlimited series, then you have already seen much better stories with Superman and Doomsday. I was hoping this movie would be a notch better than the Justice League Unlimited, while the animation and action are a notch up, the story fails to match JLU's high standards.

There is practically no character development and what is there seems odd for Superman. Here's an example. In a lot of the comics and movies and stories concerning Superman, he is always trying to get Lois to notice him as Clark Kent and fall in love with him without knowing he is Superman. This movie is the complete opposite. He has an ongoing romantic relationship with Lois, but doesn't want to tell her his secret identity to protect her. Huh?

I'm not opposed to characters and story elements being different from one medium or project to the next, if there is a reason, but a lot of the changes in this movie feel like it is different just to be different. All of these characters have been animated for the last few years under Bruce Timm's direction. Those designs have grown on me so I was disappointed that these designs weren't better, only different (and does anyone else think Superman looks like he has a huge underbite eveytime he talks? And why doesn't Mercy have a nose?)

There is very little emotion to the story. Sure, sad things happen and people cry, but just seeing people cry is not enough to affect me as a viewer. It's as if I am being shown how I should feel instead of the story and characters creating these feelings.

Then there is Lex Luthor, his actions and words are there to show you how evil he is. He has no motivation. He only does anything to show the audience how evil he is.

The battle with Doomsday is intense and the best part of the movie. Doomsday looked great and went a long way to make this movie aimed at older audiences by killing a lot of people. But Superman doesn't do much to prevent these deaths either. He is notified that he is needed in Metropolis while in the Fortress of Solitude. He casually walks to the control room and watches new clips of Doomsday killing people while his robot explains to him where Doomsday came from (the robot no doubt found out on Wikipedia). Superman eventually gets to the fight, but then he destroys entire buildings with Doomsdays body. His last act alone probably killed quite a few people (although it was a pretty awesome way to end the battle). I know there will be lots of defense to this statement (the battle was horrific, he was fighting for his life, etc) but a lot of Superman's character is how he bends over backward to preserve human life. He just didn't seem that concerned about human life throughout the whole movie, and maybe the creators realized this so they added a crying child standing alone in the middle of the street amidst the battle for Superman to rescue at his own detriment. But enough about Doomsday, he's hardly in the movie anyway (I know, he shares the title with Superman, but I guess that's just for promotional purposes).

The pacing of the movie was a little odd and the Justice League were sorely missed. The original Death of Superman story arc was able to last as long as it did because there were several beats to the battle. First Doomsday was introduced causing mass destruction in rural America, but still partially bound by his costume. Then the JLA (made up of essentially second stringers at the time) confronted Doomsday only to have their asses handed too them while Doomsday literally still had one arm behind his back. Then Superman confronted Doomsday still in rural America, along with the injured JLA, only to destroy the rest of Doomsday's costume, which was restraining him. The battle spanned several states and became much more serious because Doomsday was now unrestrained.  Then he entered Metropolis. This was significant for two reasons. One, it was Superman's home and two, it is a heavily populated city so collateral damage was more sever. Now I don't care that this movie is not a direct translation, but Superman battles Doomsday at the beginning of the movie. There is no build in the stakes. Doomsday is introduced. He is not restrained in any way. Doomsday arrives in Metropolis. Superman uses his super arctic breath to freeze Doomsday (what is up with this writer and super arctic breath?). The arctic breath doesn't stop Doomsday!!!! This guy is tough!!! Superman fights Doomsday. The battle is pretty awesome, but it has no build so it's just another fight for Superman.

I agree with the other reviewer who said the funeral scene was disappointing without any of the other superheroes. I'm okay with leaving out some characters to streamline the story, but some cameos would have been nice.

It's no secret that Superman dies in this movie. Now if you kill your hero in act one, then how do you top that in the finally? The comic book, however long and crazy, succeeded. The entire world was in peril. Disasters larger than Doomsday led up to the finally of the Reign of the Supermen. I know this movie couldn't be an adaptation of the comic books, but I was hoping for something at least as entertain or interesting. After Doomsday, the movie follows a tried and true tired idea that nowhere near rivals the scope of the original story that inspired this movie.

I could go on and on about other things that annoyed me (Superman hanging out lifting weights, it's not very dramatic that's for sure or removing a small object from between your brain lobes with a mirror and a pair of succors in a beauty salon? The scene is creepy but come on!) but I think you get the idea. I'm being nitpicky on a poor script.

In closing, the first half hour is pretty good. The animation is topnotch the whole way through. I'll re-watch it just for the battle with Doomsday, it is a great battle, even if it is a little short for the biggest battle of Superman's life. If you want to see a better written story where the JLA fight Doomsday (it's actually an alternate reality version of the Justice League, but it is still a pretty sweat battle) pick up the Justice League season 2 set for the two part episode ""A Better World."" It also shows a darker ""reflection"" of Superman if events had gone differently in his life, a theme this movie attempts to convey, but fails to do so, leaving the villain to explain this theme to the viewer. And the Justice League Unlimited episode ""Doomsday Sanction"" is one of my favorite episodes of the series and features Superman fighting Doomsday in the heart of an active Volcano. Talk about picking your settings. It's beautiful. And Batman's role in that episode is just icing on a very tasty cake.

Am I being hard on this movie? Yes. Maybe a little too hard. I suppose if these previous animated outings didn't exist, I might be digging this movie, but they do so why bother with this new inferior product?",1190160000,,7162,4.6130298273155415

Not very climatic,but pretty dramtic end. By the way Clark is writen off as beging in Afganistand. Well with the furnel over so is the movie, right? No thats act one.
 (Act 2)Like all of Metroplis ,Lex is not a happy camper. Howerever it is not for the same reason everyone else is sad. He was cheated from his prize. No worrries though. Approx 2weeks have passed,and thanks too stolen blood:To quote Yoda:""The Clone War has begun"".But this Superman is a little bit distrubed. Thanks too Lexs genetics -he doesnt mind the occasional killing of a foe,or scolding a old woman who can't control her cat. That same two weeks later Loise is still trying too cope with her lose. To top off a shaky vist with Martha,she beings too suspect the return of her guy. Remeber the robot well at some point he stoll his masters body from Lex-who rob the grave.(act3)It took the robot 34days too find his master. He revives him,and the race is on for a quick recovery. Because ""It's what I do""-the real Super-Man returns at only a named 67% power & armed. Will this be a re-run of the Doomsday fight,buy the dvd too find out.
Ok- I hold this movie on a shaky 4 out of 5 because plus out weigh the minus.here are some.
Plus: animation in general,fight scenes(very good),pg13 (for some blood,sprinkle of bad words,and adult situations),A good job at craming  a story line that ran close too 3yrs and a on slaught of comic titles in only 70minutes(between credits).
Minus:This is Doomsday,there should of been more of him. DD & SM should of looked more like swiss cheese after what they put each other through. Although they were good SM & Loise voices actors were a little weak in my opion.",1190160000,2,2651,4.602536997885835

The only commonality it had with the actual book was 1: Superman, 2 : Doomsday, 3: Lois, a poor adaption, with an attempt to create 3rd dimension by throwing in a very ""grown up"" arguement between Lois and Kal-El.

No other league memebers, no supergirl, no plateu, no climax, just a poor beginning, which diluted the ending, how disappointing.

The big name actors did nothing for the series, nor did the art work, I would've suggested they saved some money and used the artists/style of the Justice League series, as well as the  fantastic voice actors from the series, and created a closer story line to the actual comic book sequence.

(I am not anti-Superman; it is just that the issue and story was done so well in the issue he died). I thought this move is terrible. The battle between Superman and Doomsday seemed like it would be a good one, but was over way too quick and the continuing story afterwards was just the same thing I have seen in other superhero plots over and over again. If you have read the comic it is nothing like that. I had images of that issue in my mind as the opening credits started and I was severely disappointed.

2817509,1,B000PE0G0A,"This direct to DVD release was an unnecessarily brutal rendition of the Man of Steel.  The film intends to portray the Death and Return of Superman story arc from the comics, but instead offers a gratuitously violent film that is strangely cold and grotesque at times.  Fans hoping to find a movie highlighting the Doomsday character mentioned in the title will find that he actually serves as subplot for another showdown between Luthor and Superman.  Doomsday himself is not explained, is not given any character development, and disappears one third into the movie.  The fight between Superman and Doomsday that should be the climax of the movie is actually anticlimactic and only serves as a backdrop to the main story.
The story and character portrayal in this film are also uncharacteristic to the Superman mythos.  A cameo by a needlessly revamped Toyman is both grotesque and revolting.  Superman himself is portrayed as a cold, bland, unthinking mass of muscle who simply pummels his opponents.  Judging by the lack of a decent story, it appeared that the producers of this film were so excited about making an animated film that was rated PG-13 that they focused more of their efforts into putting blood, violence and profanity into the film rather than a riveting story that is respectful of the Superman character.  The darkness of this film is more becoming of Batman rather than Superman.  In fact after watching the film, I could not help but think that this story was a rewrite of the Batman-Bane-Azrael story arc from the Batman comics, with Superman assuming the role of the broken Batman, Doomsday assuming the role of Bane and the Superman Clone (yes, clone) assuming the role of Azrael.
The voice acting was subpar, with the producers still trying but ultimately failing to replace talent such as Clancy Brown (who was an excellent Lex Luthor), Dana Delany (who portayed a strong Lois Lane) and Tim Daly (whose Superman remains one of the best).  Instead, we are treated to a whiny Lois (Anne Heche), a boring Superman (Adam Baldwin) and a forgettable Lex (James Marsters).  The animation was also not of the same quality of previous Superman animated stories.  In particular, Superman is strangely drawn with more lines on his face, giving him a haggard and old look.  Lex Luthor appears more gaunt than previous incarnations as well.  I find it very disappointing and alarming that the creative team behind the Superman Animated Series (which remains one of the best portrayals of the Man of Steel in both live-action and animated media) could allow their standards of quality to drop to the level of this and the last animated film (Superman vs. Brainiac).",1190160000,5,2680,4.939866369710468

2817511,4,B000PE0G0A,"Thank you, Amazon, for the quick delivery! I got my order for this dvd yesterday.
I'm a comic book fan, I actually own the ""Death and return of Superman"" in its original comic crossover form. This event in comic history was very significant (while it lasted) in the early 1990's because of the repercussions throughout the DC universe. Now, more than 10 years later, we see this event in animated form. Is it as significant? Honestly, for me, not really.

LEXCORP has organized a dig to find a new source of energy from the Earth's core. Accidentally, they unearth the buried ship of a monster called Doomsday. A killing machine created from the genetic labs of Krypton from the past. A being so powerful, he rampages through the U.S. until he reaches Metropolis. Superman gives his all to stop the monster at a terrible price. .
All of Metropolis mourns its hero, even Lex Luthor, who mourns the passing of the last son of Krypton in his own twisted and sinister way.

At first glance, I thought this animated movie was going to be reminiscent of the Superman animated series in the 90's. But no, this is a stand-alone movie unrelated to either the fantastic ""Justice League"" and the Superman animated series. In this movie, Superman is the only super-hero on Earth; Lois didn't know beforehand that Clark was Superman before they had an intimate relationship. You might say that Superman was the real person and Clark was only a disguise. This fact was changed before by John Byrne who marvelously developed the Clark Kent persona.

The movie is not perfect, but at least it felt more geared towards the Teen-Adult demography than kids below 12. The brawl with Doomsday was very intense, there is some blood and it shows (almost) as much PG-13 brutality as it can spare. The atmosphere and the story are quite darker than we are usually used to when dealing with ""DC animated"" features. Imagine a being with Superman's powers that was raised by Luthor. The film also has some mildly ""sexy"" moments between Kal-El and Lois, and a titillation moment between Lois and Lex. You might say that these moments proved that animated features as well as comics are changing with the times. Children are no longer the main demographic to animated super-hero movies.

 To its credit, the film will be able to hold the audience's attention for the most part, there are some plot holes but who cares, right? It's a cartoon even though it runs for almost 2 hours. No one can make a very detailed feature with superman's death and return in those few minutes.

The animation/art was very good, although I can't get over the cheekbones in Supes' face and the big line from Lex's head to his cheeks. Nice rendering with the Lois Lane, though. Martha Kent makes an appearance, I'm sorry to say no Jonathan Kent was present.

PRESENTATION: Very cool lenticular collectible cover.
VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.78 anamorphic widescreen. Nice transfer, sharp and radiant with solid blacks throughout the animation. 5.1 Dolby digital sound is very crisp.
EXTRAS: Making of features, trailers, ""Justice League: New Frontier"" featurette and more.
Final thoughts:
As a comic book fan/collector, I find this animated feature decent enough to do Superman justice and add to his legendary annals in pop culture. It is a fresh look at the ""Death and return of Superman""! It brought back memories...
Recommended! (4 stars)",1190160000,5,3378,4.854166666666667

2817513,1,B000PE0G0A,"After reading the ""graphic novel"" and with extra high anticipation for the release of the animated version that was supposed to be based on it, I was highly, extraordinarily disappointed.  Whoever ""envisioned"" this piece of crap as being based on the comics, should learn how to read. Some reviewers say that people are ragging this because it is not ""exactly"" like the comics.  I have news for those lost souls, it wasn't even close to the comics. Superman, Doomsday, death, yes but all the attributes that made the readers of the comics become engrossed in the story was totally missing from this failed attempt. The thread where Doomsday mows through members of the Justice League...gone. That was an extremely important part of the storyline that built up anticipation for the showdown with Supes. To think that anything could desimate this many members of the JL, and then face the combined powers of Superman and several members of the JL and still be standing gave credence to the thought that it was even possible to kill the Man of Steel. The fact that they left out the Keith thread from the comics was the only saving grace this movie had. The animation was the worse I have ever see. Hey DC, watch some of Marvel's animated movies for a lesson on how to animate. What were those ""T"" marks under Superman's eyes...cheeks? At least have your animators take a remedial course on how to draw! Bottom line for this animated failure is to save yourself $5.00 and buy the graphic novel. If you must have animation, buy the DVD and just play with the 3-D cover, it's WAY better than the actual film. I have to go to counselling now for severe depression brought on by being so let down.",1190160000,3,1690,4.648829431438127
2817514,1,B000PE0G0A,"I would like to say that a lot of the problems I had with this movie was caused by the decision to make the feature a stand-alone movie. I believe the live-action movies are for the masses therefore stand-alone features. Allowing the animated movies and series to contain long story arcs, complex personalities, and lots of history; therefore pleasing a hard-core audience like myself.

So throwing away the years of Batman/Superman TAS and Justice League prevents the movie from being great in so many ways. The result of this decision prevents other heroes and ""great"" villians from making an appearance. As well as the voice actors that we've grow to associate them with. Just listen to Lois Lane to realize how big of a mistake this move was, I was really missing Dana Delany. Andrea Romano has done a great job in the past so I'm really not sure what happen there. I also feel like the animators were forced to draw the character differently from the series, the lines on Clark's face drove me (and alot of other people) crazy.

So I just want to let Warner Brothers know if you continue to make DC animated movies stop making the same mistake, just give Bruce Timm full artistic freedom and you'll get a great movie that will sell.

Oh and if your looking for a good animated story about the drama caused by the death of Superman, watch Hereafter part 1-2 (Justice League Season 2).",1190160000,3,1388,4.634146341463414
2817515,4,B000PE0G0A,"It's not the animated series, and it's not 100% faithful to the books.  It would be impossible to be either or both.  The story is too violent and too long.  So, Timm and company do their best to make it all fit in.  Here's my take.

The good:  The heart of the story is there.  Superman fights an almost unbeatable (and previously unknown) foe to a stalemate resulting in both combatants dying.  The world, and Metropolis especially, grieves.  Then Superman returns...or does he?  The action is stupendous, and well worth the viewing.  The third act (the return) is vastly different from the books, but it works by still imparting that just because someone wears the S doesn't make them Superman.  Animation and voice acting are great, as one would expect.  A lot of the emotion is captured, especially with Lex and Lois each dealing with the loss in their own (sometimes twisted) way.  The meeting between Lois and Martha Kent is a fine example of what made the sequence great.  Much like the comics, the story is not so much about Superman as it is about the people around him.  The writers know that, and made sure to keep the focus where it belonged.

The bad:  It does feel rushed and could use with more time.  It moves pretty quickly through the second act, and the start of the third act doesn't quite have the punch that the original comics had due to the nature of the ""returned"" Superman.  We don't get the feeling of mourning that the ""Funeral"" sequence should convey (more on that later).  Also, fans of the story will be utterly confused at the change in Lois and Clark's relationship (Lois is dating Superman, but he hasn't told her he's Clark yet).  This fixes itself, but the change without any warning to existing canon may turn some off.

The ugly:  For whatever reason, this story exists in a vacuum.  No other heroes show up at all.  Part of what made the original story great was how the rest of the DC universe dealt with Superman's passing.  There isn't even a cameo.  That makes this feel much more like a one-off than a universe changing event.

I doubt that any movie would be able to encompass all of the Death and Return of Superman within a time frame that would be reasonable.  This version does a pretty good job, if you can get past the shortcomings I mentioned.  As a standalone story (not attached to AoS or JLA/U), it captures the essence of the most shocking story in DC history, even if the details could have used some improvement.  Rent it, borrow it, or watch it on OnDemand if a different take might bother you.  If you're like me and love the story even with some changes, get it.",1190160000,5,2624,4.503184713375796
2817516,1,B000PE0G0A,"i waited for sept, 17 just to be dissapointed.

the movie is lame... the animation is awful and the story just misses the point completely.

as an excuse bruce timm and company say that it is too much to cram 2 years worth of comics into 75 mins of film.

well... they lie! they could have easily integrated a lot of stuff from the comics and the story this film is supposedly based upon.

but it seems they needed to come up with a project for WB & DC and it
lacks heart and soul.

after 15 years it's an awful way to try and make a buck.

the disc does not even include all the extras and features that the advertaising claimed... not even it's own trailes.

the only jewel worth the 14 dollars is SUPERMAN LIVES! a look back into how and why superman got killed in the comics...

by now we know there is a guideline they must follow about not using certain characters on more than one or two media at the time... this is why there is no justice league in supes funeral... because they're in JUSTICE LEAGUE: NEW FRONTIER wich i hope does better... and it seems it will stay true to the book it is based upon.",1190160000,5,1110,4.154205607476635

Ahem, now that that's out of the way. Just so you can place my personal bias, aside from being a big StAS/JL/JLU, etc, fan, I'm a big Superman popular culture fan (radio, tv, movies). Specifically the different ways various eras represent Supes and company. I approach works in separate formats separately, e.g., books to movies.

Anyway, the action is fast paced, violent, and yet with some fairly complex motivations. The writers managed to fit 4 villains: Doomsday, Lex Luthor, Toyman, and... up to interpretation, into the narrative without feeling rushed.

There were some simply stunning images. From the iconic tattered Supes cape fluttering to a Times Square-ish monitor displaying the draped image of a murdered child while tiny Superman floats a dot in front of it. The voice talent was particularly well chosen. Especially, Marsters' cold to full on obsessive Lex Luthor. The overall thematic arc of the story was very well done and played very interestingly with: one of my favorite tropes, the hero to villain dichotomy.

The featurette on the Death of Superman/Rise of Superman comic was interesting, and contained footage of actual story board sessions from the period as well as present day interviews. The commentary is serviceable. Interesting tidbits/they manage to talk fairly continually, but nothing mind blowing in the way of insights.

2817518,1,B000PE0G0A,"Let's be clear here. For anyone that has read the comics about Superman's death and is interested in an animated form (like I was), this movie is not at all like those. The names are the same, Doomsday's a big thing from outer space, and Superman ends up in a black suit. That's pretty much it. If you want what the comics had, you'll have to read them again. Don't pick this up thinking it'll be as good or as anywhere near in-depth or epic. The fight with Doomsday and funeral are almost like side notes to get at the rest of the movie.

If, however, you are someone that has not read the comics and for some reason are still reading this, you'd probably find it interesting. It's not that I think it's a poorly made movie. I just think it's a poorly made movie when compared to its source material. The comic of his death rekindled people's interest in Superman and went on to sell more issues than any other comic in history that wasn't introducing a new character.

I was particularly happy about the sticker on it hailing it as a first ever Superman animation that is PG-13.  Great! Hard hitting subject matter for adults!  I was soon to be disappointed.

Here's why it's PG-13-
1. Doomsday is just brutal- he kills everyone he encounters, even Bambi's dad, which he does with a twist of the antlers.
2. Superman and Lois appear at the Fortress of Solitude in the aftermath of a clearly sexual encounter.  Lois says later that she and Superman have been seeing each other for six months.
3. Toyman kills a 4 year old girl, though this thankfully happens behind the scenes.
4. The man in the red cape kills Toyman in cold blood.
5. Lex Luthor is brutally thuggish instead of diabolically evil.

I understand that they need to make changes to make it fit into a 75min. video, but I was extremely disappointed with the funeral scene.  In the comic, there were dozens of DC Universe heroes attending Superman's funeral; Batman, Wonder Woman, heck most of the Justice League paid their respects.  It was one of the most memorable scenes from the book.  However in the video, nothing.  Not one other superhero showed up.  That reason alone really took a lot of the ""punch"" out of the funeral scene, which in it's self felt rather rushed.  Well, that's my two cents.

 The voice acting was terrific, as well. Everyone played their parts quite well.

WARNING: Near Spoilers!

This is a significantly abridged version of the story. There are a couple minutes of touching footage that brings the emotional height of the full story to mind, but the rest is just a slugfest of Superman vs. Doomsday, Superman vs. Dark Superman, Dark Superman doing dark things. There is some nifty plotting by Lex Luthor (portrayed quite well by James Marsters), and for those who remember when Nicholas Cage was slated to play Superman a few years back, keep an eye open for a Kevin Smith cameo attached to a hilarious inside joke. Unfortunately, there isn't even a hint of any of the other DC heroes that were involved in the original story, and Superman's recovery was so truncated that there is no sense of drama attached to it.

END SPOILERS

As a personal observation, I'd also like to point out that I don't care for how Superman's/Clark's face was drawn. The chin is big enough that it's just funny lookin', and the cheek lines are the kind of thing you'd expect to see on a man who's as old as the story of Superman really is... This is just art however, and you can't make art that appeals to everyone, so it's not too big a deal.

The high point of the disc however is the special features, which consist of a series of interviews with the writers & artists who did the original story, and what was going through their minds at the time, and some of what contributed to the reason for writing this story arch. Frankly, I think that the bits & pieces of the story you get during these interviews tell a better version of the story arch than the movie itself. There is also a 2nd disc in CD-ROM format for your computer that has Issue #75 on it, so you can read it for yourself. (Though I would have preferred to have the whole omnibus<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Death-and-Return-of-Superman-Omnibus/dp/1401215505/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Death and Return of Superman Omnibus</a>&nbsp;on there, even if it would have doubled the price).

Ingenuity and compassion have been replaced with violence and cruelty. There is no story--just one long fight scene after another.

(I thought that Timm's Superman the Animated Series had the ugliest Superman--this Superman is even uglier.)",1190073600,,490,5.189873417721519
2817528,1,B000PE0G0A,"I have never written a review of a movie before.  The reason why is that most of the reviews I've read before have been honest and straightforward.  I have not found that in the reviews I have read here.  Hence, I am writing a review for this one.  I hope someone at DC Comics or Warner Brothers reads this one.

Superman:Doomsday.  The storyline in the original comic was rich in character, rich in story, and rich in a great many things.  What it was not rich in was disappointment.  Being an animated feature, I was prepared for many things; disappointment, enlightenment, or a whole new story.  What I was not prepared for was anger.  I am absolutely livid over this, and I find that surprising.

Let me qualify myself.  I am an independent filmmaker.  I am used to struggling with small budgets.  I am used to struggling with tepid stories.  I am used to struggling with a great many things.  I often thing about what I could do with the resources of a company like Warner Brothers, Paramount, or DC.  DC is not a filmmaking company.  That much is obvious if you've seen Superman: Doomsday.  However, with the backing of Warner Brothers, you would think they would be able to find an expert in film making.",1190073600,3,1211,4.523148148148148
2817529,2,B000PE0G0A,"I own all the individual comics of superman, well all the good one anyway, and I was excited to hear that they were making an animated movie over the greatest comic of all time, The Death of Superman. After watching Superman Doomsday, I was very disappointed. The movie is called Superman Doomsday, but doomsday is only in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie then we never see or even hear of him again. I mean, the Doomsday creature that just killed Superman should get some mention, Right? If you're a fan of the comic don't pick this movie up and if you do, just watch the first 20 minutes or you will be in for a disappointing ride. DC you screwed the fans again, thanks.",1190073600,5,679,4.3125
2817530,4,B000PE0G0A,"The first in a line of straight to DVD animated features adapted from classic DC stories, Superman: Doomsday re-tells the much maligned Death of Superman saga from the early 90's in animated form, and despite what many of the negative reviews here say otherwise, it works.  The Man of Steel (voiced by Serenity's Adam Baldwin) is in love with Lois Lane (Anne Heche) and enjoying life as usual, until his world is rocked by the arrival of the murderous creature called Doomsday, inadvertantly let loose by Lex Luthor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James ""Spike"" Marsters).  If you've read the comics, you know what happens next, but the animated feature wisely ignores the Reign of the Supermen part of the arc, in place of an imposter created by Luthor, which results in an apocalyptic showdown.  Being the first in a line of newly animated features, don't go into this expecting something among the lines of the DC animated series' that had come before it.  The animation itself looks similar to what we've seen before (veteran animator Bruce Timm is heavily involved here), but the tone is noticibly different.  The voice acting is solid (Marsters is magnificent as Luthor, while Baldwin is servicable as Superman) and the action is wonderfully orchestrated as well, all of which makes Superman: Doomsday an animated treat.  The special features of the DVD are great as well, including an intriguing documentary on the history of the landmark comic and it's adaptation into animation, as well as a sneak peek at the next DC animated feature, the New Frontier, based on Darwyn Cooke's celebrated comic series.",1190073600,10,1607,4.977611940298507
2817531,5,B000PE0G0A,"I think people are way too biased when it comes to grading these direct to dvd animated movies.  I've read reviews of the marvel movies and they're basically the same: some expert of the comics complaining about the story not staying more faithful to the source material.  I've gotta say, as an avid comic fan myself, although it would be awesome to see an exact replica of the death of superman, I would be bored at the same time.  Why not just read the comic?

*SPOILERS*
I will say though that I was a little confused at how quickly doomsday appeared and killed superman but then found myself pleasantly surprised that they went ahead and included the whole return of superman as well (yes different but still equally as enjoyable). I had no idea they were going to do that since I thought the whole movie was just the death of him.

Would it have been awesome to see the four versions of superman in the aftermath? Yes. But would they have been able to include all of that, make the back stories work so you care about the characters and still find an emotional way to bring the real superman back all within 75 minutes? Definitely not. There's enough material to make numerous seperate 75 minute movies about all that so they had to cut it down.  (the whole death of superman and aftermath saga was like 2 years of comics...thousands of pages, ha)

When it came to the voicing of the characters, I was a little skeptical at first.  Not that I have anything against Adam Baldwin or Anne Heche (two great actors, especially Anne) but when celebrities voice cartoons, (for me at least) it tends to interfere with the movie since I can't help but put their face to the familiar voice. My fears were quickly put down though and I totally forgot they were voicing until I saw their names again at the end in the credits.  So kudos to them for doing a terrific job!

Overall, I can see how crazed-comic book fans might be disappointed but I still thought it was great.  I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder, and this beholder's eye loved every minute of it.",1190073600,8,2062,4.4429708222811675
2817532,2,B000PE0G0A,"I was very excited for this film and pre-ordered it. First of all, the designs for the characters, especially superman, were not all i could hope for. the story was weak and had very little emotional pull. I will say it had excellent action, was well animated, and had really nice special effects. But did not redeem the film.
I respect an artist's choice to change a story from the source material. but at least do something interesting and clever. This is  not worth purchasing. If you are a fan... i would rent it, or borrow it. but believe me your not missing much, missing it. Just go get Justice League on DVD and you will be better off.",1190073600,5,643,4.4033613445378155
2817533,4,B000PE0G0A,"Don't want to give away the new plot.  Doomsday part of it lasted shorter than I exspected.  I wish they made him talk during the fight.  Sounds strange, but you just don't feel his pain.  I felt more excited in the justice league finale when Superman was fighting.

Voices are good, but it didn't seem to match.  So used to the animation series I guess.  And don't take this a biggot remark, but Loise was too dark.  She seemed almost latin or hispanic in color.  Not the same as teh animation.

ANd for all the saving Superman did, I'm sure people died when he was fighting.  So to save one child, I'm sure many died.

Beyond these small short sightedness(sp), the movie is worth seeing.",1189987200,3,689,4.424
