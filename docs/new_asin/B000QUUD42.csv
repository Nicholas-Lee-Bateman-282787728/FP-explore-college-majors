8197705,5,B000QUUD42,Cut to the chase. Awesome band and great camera work. A feast for progressive fans.,1267833600,,83,4.6
8197706,4,B000QUUD42,"The recorded show is awesome, swift guitar riffs are doubled by the keyboardist with absolute precision, and the whole presentation is great.

I didn't like the interviews in the extra material, I found it quite boring comparing to extra content in other prog bands' DVDs (Take A gentleman's hurricane from Mind's Eye for instance, the whole piece is just fantastic.)",1216339200,,367,5.116666666666666
8197707,5,B000QUUD42,"If you love Dream Theater, Ayreon, Symphony X, Pain of Salvation, or even power metal groups such as Rhapsody, Kamelot, (etc). this group will entrance you and will not let go. They straddle the line between virtuosity and accessibility with expertise that is far and few between. This DVD is professionally produced, the band is in top shape, and the material equally covers the band's first three albums. It is indeed a rare treat to have such a high quality production from an up and coming group in a genre that consistently breaks new ground. In short, if you like progressive metal then this DVD is right up your alley. THANK YOU ANDROMEDA!",1209427200,2,646,4.725663716814159
