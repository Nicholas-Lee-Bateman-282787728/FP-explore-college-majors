7504641,4,B017GEWHYO,Glad that Hanna Barbera has all 26 episodes of the Secret Squirrel Show but I'm curious as to why the ending to all of the Secret Squirrel cartoons were re-edited with Atom Ant's exit music?!!!,1447113600,10,193,4.542857142857143

7504650,5,B017GEWHYO,clean entertainment.  it spoofed the spy TV shows of prime time.  Paul Frees (the voice of Boris Badenov from Bullwinkle) plays the sidekick and the boss here doing some of his trademark voices with inspiration from Peter Lorre (and Sidney Greenstreet sometimes too).  Mel Blanc voices Secret Squirrel. This character was different than his Bugs Bunny show characters and calls for more subtlety.  He plays this character nicely.,1487808000,,429,5.264705882352941
7504651,5,B017GEWHYO,If you're a Hanna-Barbera fan you have to have Secret Squirrel a classic waited forever for it to come out on DVD,1487116800,,113,4.181818181818182

7504653,5,B017GEWHYO,Great old cartoon,1484697600,,17,5.0
7504654,5,B017GEWHYO,"No, Do not order this DVD set if you don't want to go back to your childhood in the mid 1960's. Saturday morning cartoons as it's best. What a time I had back then. Men going into space, The Munsters and Addams Family on tv, and of course, all the classic cartoons. This set brings back all those memories and those Hanna Barbera sound effects! Too much fun. Quality is great even though there are a few lines still on the cells. Now if the could release Wally Gator and Hokey Wolf next to complete the set.",1484265600,,507,4.237113402061856
7504655,5,B017GEWHYO,"Loved watching this on Beta Max, one of my favorite Hanna-Barbera cartoons! DVD is in great condition and works beautifully!",1481241600,,124,5.25

7504658,5,B017GEWHYO,Love Secret Squirrel. He was one of my favorites along with his sidekick Morocco Mole. Loved them solving mysteries with a sense of humor.,1470787200,,138,4.791666666666667
7504659,5,B017GEWHYO,GREAT!,1468886400,,6,6.0
7504660,5,B017GEWHYO,I purchase this along w/ Atom Ant Complete Series. Secret Squirrel includes Squiggly Diddly and Winnie Witch episodes. Another great complete series in my Hanna-Barbera shows. It's funny I didn't notice this as a kid but Mel Blanc does the voice and I now notice how similar Secret Squirrel sounds like Bugs Bunny. Another Hanna-Barbera classic.,1467590400,5,345,5.178571428571429
7504661,5,B017GEWHYO,"Owning most of the Hanna-Barbera Disc sets, the quality of the shows are very mixed.  Some are very clean and seem remastered.  Yet, others look like they were recorded off old video tapes.  Overall, they are all worth owning, especially if you grew up during the time frame that these shows were in their prime.

This set is not recorded on DVD-R but rather on studio style discs.  Several of these Hanna-Barbera series shows are on DVD-R (blue backing) and usually are stated as such.  Others are manufactured on studio discs (silver backing like regular store bought dvd's) but are manufactured on-demand.

Not sure if this set is manufactured 'on-demand' or not, but the quality of the discs are great as well as the quality of the shows themselves.  They seem cleaned up, possibly remastered, are are a pleasure to watch.  I would definitely recommend this set and shows seem complete (from what I can remember way back when).  One must always keep in mind on the years these Hanna-Barbera shows were on and what the studios have to work with as far as the master tapes go.  Very happy and pleased with this set.",1466294400,10,1117,4.676923076923077
7504662,5,B017GEWHYO,"This is the original television show which includes three different HB cartoons. Secret Squirrel, Winnie Witch and my favorite, Squiddly Diddly!  Treat your kids to this one, it is a winner!",1466208000,2,190,5.129032258064516

7504671,5,B017GEWHYO,"One of the best Hanna Barbara short animated series developed . Its satirical mockery of the then oversaturated spy gendre allowed for young people and adults to see the fun & ridiculous side if espionage. What a team the squirrel & the mole made. And it wasn't coincidence that a ""Mole""was chosen. This cartoon was before its time.",1454025600,10,332,4.741379310344827

8739091,4,B017GEWHYO,Only reason for not 5 stars is it has the habit of playing the theme song twice before every SS episode,1522800000,,103,3.9523809523809526
