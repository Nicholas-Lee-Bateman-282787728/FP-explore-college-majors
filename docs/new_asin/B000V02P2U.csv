2928075,5,B000V02P2U,"Addiction! Jumong is in one word Addiction! The actors are wonderful, there is not one powerful moment throughout the whole series that isn't believeable and intense. Sayong and Hypbo are a few of my favorites and Mapalmo! I also loved Yuntabal. Oh hell! I love them all, from King Kumwa to the terribly evil Daesou.

The series explores every political motive, and you can see each decision made no matter how good or how evil is one that is agonized over before committing to it and even afterward they steel themselves to the consequences of their actions. Even while they breathe a sigh of relief every time their lives are spared.

Throughout the whole series I scream at my monitor, behead the snake, behead him! He's betrayed you and makes you a puppet too many times! Listen to the Gods! Listen to your people Kumwa, join your hands and fate with Jumong! There is no watching just one episode, you have to watch it to its very end.",1223769600,12,939,4.583333333333333
2928076,5,B000V02P2U,"Great Korean drama.  This final volume is a must see.
The special features at the end are great.  I enjoyed the ending theme song as the final credits rolled.  Also, the interview with cast and director was very good.",1192060800,10,217,4.512820512820513
8216007,5,B000V02P2U,"EXCELLENT...Seen the volumes from 2 to 4 and the actors representing their roles were excellent....beautiful scenery and costumes. The director could have spent little bit more time on Jumong and his adult son Yuri final roles ...it seems like that was dropped off when we only see Jumong clutching his hand on his heart,  overlooking Soho's departure with her sons.",1504051200,,366,5.1

8216009,4,B000V02P2U,"Jumong as a whole is a fantastic series, and I loved it - 10 stars for volumes 1-3. Maybe it's just me but I thought this Volume 4 - the last 20-odd episodes had lost the edge-of-the seat momentum that the first 60 episodes had. Could this be explained by the fact the producers decided to end the series at episode 60, but due to the overwhelming netizen outcry who wanted it to never end, they re-negotiated the contracts with the actors and decided to give us 20 more episodes? I think it shows. Yes the last episodes are still really good, but to me something of an anticlimax. It seemed to run out of steam around the time they introduced Yuri, Jumong's son. I wish they'd ended it at around 65 episodes, and on a really high note like the rest of the series.",1430006400,,764,4.275862068965517

Classic & unforgettable.  80+ episodes.",1409702400,,84,5.0
8216012,5,B000V02P2U,"This series is long --- 80 episodes. But I never found it to be boring, it has always engaged me. While it's engaging and exciting, I have to admit that it drags sometimes. It's so obvious that they tried too hard to extend the series.",1374019200,,235,4.2444444444444445
8216013,5,B000V02P2U,"The DVD set arrived before the scheduled delivery date.  It is an entertaining historical drama, with a soap opera nature. It is subtitled in English.  Once we started watching, it became addictive, so couldn't wait for the next episode; hence the purchase of the set.  The production is of high quality; the acting and directing are excellent.",1364601600,,344,5.0
8216014,5,B000V02P2U,Great series!  Couldn't wait for the next espisode.  Wish it would have gone on further into their lives.  Enjoyed it so much.,1363996800,,126,4.636363636363637
8216015,5,B000V02P2U,"This gave me insight into Korea of the past. It probably is heavily slated for the preconceptions people have about historical Korea but that doesn't matter. Everyone in my family enjoyed watching this and got very involved in it. Our hearts ached for Jumong and his love life. The continuing saga of the development of iron and the wars for freedom, never gets old.",1353888000,,366,4.734375
8216016,5,B000V02P2U,"Outstanding series, but #4 is especially enjoyable.  An excellent mix of history, mythology and entertainment.  Also liked the 45 minute TV extra with the actors discussing the series.

I would suggest people who enjoyed this series to also view the youtube 5 segments of 5 Jumong series actors taking a trip to the capital of North Korea, it includes visiting the burial site and museum of Jumong (shown in number 5).",1331424000,,418,4.859154929577465
