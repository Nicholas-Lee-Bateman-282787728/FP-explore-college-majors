Connie Francis is featured as she helps tell this story. Fascinating to hear the behind the scenes action. Fans of Connie Francis will like this the most.,1470009600,,293,4.547169811320755
8687519,5,B00PCSVMX4,"Very good documentary about DJs back in the early 1960s and how almost all the young artists got screwed by the record companies and managers they came in contact with. Sad, but true. It was particularly interesting to hear the great beloved Chubby Checker tell his story.",1449014400,,272,4.808510638297872
8687520,5,B00PCSVMX4,This Phila based documentary shows the business side of the record industry in the 1950's.  Dick Clark was not the goody-2-shoes we all thought he was.  He knew how to make money and he didn't care who he stepped on to get it. Just pay attention to what happened to Charlie Gracie.,1439337600,,281,4.384615384615385
8687521,5,B00PCSVMX4,"Working in radio in the past I knew of some of these stories, but I had no idea how dirty it was. I see Dick Clark in a different light now.",1425686400,2,140,3.5483870967741935
8687522,5,B00PCSVMX4,"This was a lot of fun.  If you are a Bandstand enthusiast then you will enjoy it.  It's not about the kids dancing though or that type of thing.  This digs into the type of person Dick Clark really was.  The whole aspect of payola.  A history of Bandstands beginnings.  It has a few little short interviews with some of the regulars.  If you've ever read books about Bandstand and what really happened, this documentary sort of drives the point home from an insider aspect by the people that were there.  I remember hearing about this documentary coming out by it was being presented as a film in only a certain local area I believe.  I'm very glad it got put on DVD and you'd better grab one before they are out of print and long gone.  The whole thing was handled very well and presented in an entertaining way.",1425081600,,813,4.36
