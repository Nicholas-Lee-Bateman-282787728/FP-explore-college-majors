A very funny and somewhat serious look at the Korean ""moneylenders"" and their trade. I never get tired of watching this drama and learn something new each time I watch.  As usual, the translation is somewhat rough, and it may be difficult for non-Korean speakers to follow, but you can still follow the story.  Park, Shin-Young always rocks!",1405641600,,460,4.846153846153846
