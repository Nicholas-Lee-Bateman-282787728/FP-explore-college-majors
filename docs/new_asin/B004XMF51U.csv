8447155,5,B004XMF51U,"I just watched this DVD and was greatly impressed with the content and historical evidence of how the democrats and republicans treated black Americans from before the Civil War and into the future. I think the ""party of the poor"" would be greatly surprised at how they have oppressed the blacks from making progress. How wonderful to have such an open and frank depiction of truly great Americans who were black. It makes me proud to be a Republican and I would wish all black Americans could view this DVD. Of course all Americans should view it and in the future I am going to be viewing other DVDs offered by wallbuilders.com.",1356652800,,630,4.633928571428571
