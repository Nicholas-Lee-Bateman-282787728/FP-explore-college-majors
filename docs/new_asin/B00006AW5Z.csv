7966626,5,B00006AW5Z,"5 stars for Nathan Page fans. It's the most on screen time in a film for him. Keep your remote handy so you can fast forward (or rewind) his scenes. The film is nuts and god knows what it's about. ""Young and beautiful actors up for a weird film experiment"" would be a good subtitle.",1447804800,,282,4.1454545454545455
7966627,4,B00006AW5Z,"First, I'm a HUGE Nathan Page fan from Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries, so I was hoping for more of him talking. His lack of dialogue was disappointing, however his scenes made up for it! The other cast and plot was a good romp along lines of Magnolia (1999).",1445472000,,256,4.354166666666667

7966629,5,B00006AW5Z,Five stars for being strange and quirky .  I nice change from the run of the mill stuff.  I agree with another reviewer Nathan Page fans might want to check out this movie. Great actor.,1416182400,3,185,4.257142857142857
7966630,5,B00006AW5Z,"You can't go by my rating.  It's a quirky kind of movie and unless you're into quirky, you probably won't like it.  I gave it five stars only because it had Nathan Page in a prominent role and I am a card carrying super fan of Nathan Page.  I really liked the movie but I'm sure it's because I'm biased.  So if you are a Nathan Page super fan like I am, you'll love, love, love this movie.  If you're not, maybe not so much.",1408406400,7,424,3.9411764705882355
