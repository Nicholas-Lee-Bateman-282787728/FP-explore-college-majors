7840207,4,6303181961,I love doing this tape! it's a great workout.,1430870400,,45,4.111111111111111
7840208,5,6303181961,"Tamilee Webb provides the perfect balance of patient coaxing and firmly pushing her students to their maximum potential.  This VHS tape is carefully paced but never boring.  I enjoyed an adequate amount of stepping combined with arm movement for a great overall cardio workout. No weights. Thorough warm up, stretch and cool down combined with skillful and effective stepping make this one workout I will do again and again.  The routine is switched up just enough to keep it challenging but not so much as to make it overwhelming. My only regret is that I could not get this on DVD.",1394668800,,583,4.752475247524752

....

The point I'm trying to make is that I used to look like Tom Cruise back when he played Maverick in Top Gun, alright? I would include a photo of me from my past modeling career to prove it to you, but unfortunately, photos are not supported on this platform. My wife says I WAS HOT........meaning I no longer am anymore. This brings me to the problem I ran into:
I'm almost half a century old now, and wishing I could go back in time and re-live the glory days, just like in 17 Again when Matthew Perry magically transformed into his younger self, played by Zac Efron. He was no longer out of shape, no longer fighting to save his marriage, and no longer looking for a way to escape what he had become. He instead became, once again, a smokin' hot 17 year old boy in high school. This is what I wanted back so desperately.
That being said, my wife and I bought this VHS when we were first married. I never had any use for it back then. After going on an archeological dig through all the old boxes of ancient artifacts and possessions we own, I finally found this video once again.
I am here to tell you that my buns have never been...well....steel-ier since using this marvelous piece of art sent down from heaven. For your safety, I won't go into too much more information. I want to let EVERYONE know how amazing this product is and how guilty I feel for ever letting it go to waste for those 20 years of its existence. I will be passing this video on to my son, and he will pass it onto his son, and so on and so forth. Just as the Invisibility Cloak was passed on from generation to generation to Harry Potter, this video will be equally cherished by all members of my family in the present, as well as in the future.
The best part of this production had to be the intensity, as well as insanity you feel within the first 10 minutes. It was only the warm-up and I remember thinking, ""Holy  %$&*@, this sucks."" Thank goodness, I kept trucking on, because otherwise I wouldn't look nearly as good as I do now. Again, I would include a picture, but photo uploads are not available on Amazon (Hey Amazon, can you fix that?).
This was BY FAR THE BEST aerobics and step workout I have ever done. It even gives Coach Pecorelli a run for her money.

I love you, Buns of Steel. XOxXxOOoXx.",1379203200,,2337,4.221476510067114
7840210,3,6303181961,I have just stated this tape and only got into the first 10 minutes when I decided to watch it prior to doing it.  It is a bit fast moving and the steps tend to be more complicated than I am accustomed to but I feel sure I will be able to get through it after review.  More for intermediate and advanced stepper I think.,1312502400,,320,3.9076923076923076
7840211,5,6303181961,"This was the first step video I ever owned.  I found the Buns of Steel Step 2000 kit at Target in 1994, which contained the step box shown and this video.  I have bought many exercise videos over the years, along with some gadgets, many of which are long gone.  I still have the step actually, don't use it as often as my club step but it does come in handy here and there.  The video however I still do quite regularly.

It is led by Tamilee Webb, she is joined by Megan and Lori who appear in many of the Buns of Steel videos alongside her.  Tamilee and Lori exercise on a 6 inch step, while Megan uses an 8 inch step, the entire workout including warmup and cooldown is around 25-30 minutes.  The setting is pretty drab, same as many of the Buns of Steel videos, which has never bothered me.

I have used a lot of step videos over the years, surprisingly this isn't as basic as one would think, but it certainly isn't hard either.  About all you will see are knee lifts, side leg lifts, hamstring curls, over the tops, straddles, turn steps, taps ups, etc.  Tamilee puts all these steps into two simple combinations that are easy to follow, she cues well and will step from your point of view (or mirror) so you can see if you are doing it correctly.  Believe it or not, there aren't any basic steps in the whole routine.

This video is my old ""standby"".  I have had it longer than any of my other videos, and I have bought a lot, probably over 300 total over the years. I can honestly say, I will never part with this video.  It's not that hard, may not be the most exciting but I enjoy it.  No matter how many times I start and stop a fitness program, this is the one that gets me up and moving.",1274400000,2,1700,4.140243902439025
7840212,3,6303181961,"I like Tamilee and Tracy but Donna gets very patronizing and has some overly complicated combinations.  The tape is only about 20 minutes aerobics, 20 minutes of squats, and 10 minutes of cool down/warm up, which isn't bad but I would like more aerobics.  This is an okay intermediate tape, but the squats do their job pretty well.",1049760000,2,331,4.689655172413793
7840213,5,6303181961,"This workout is one of the best I have ever used.  Three instructors alternate with their different styles through a step routine during the first half.  The second half is spent using the step to do squats and lunges working every muscle that allows us to walk.  The music used by the instructors is perfect for the workout.  I have owned all the Buns of Steel 2000 videos and while they are all great, this one gives the best workout.",1044057600,9,436,4.4125
7840214,5,6303181961,"This step video consists of a 25-minute step routine (includes a warmup and very short cool down) and a 25-minute toning routine for legs and buns.  Tamilee Webb, Donna Richardson, and Tracy York all take over the instructor roles throughout the video which I like.  It brings a nice change of pace to the workout.  The step portion is similar to the routine in the Buns-of-Steel 7 video, but is a little more challenging (in terms of applying power moves) and not as repetitious as the instructors change.  I was able to do the step routine the first time I popped the video in, so it is not very complicated.  It is also fairly short, but you will make up for it in the next segment: toning.
The toning portion really burns!  It is also pretty long for toning exercises (about 25 minutes).  I can see how regular use of this video will bring faster results than the older Buns-of-Steel videos. I would have liked to see an abdominal workout thrown in (maybe by cutting the leg toning excercises by half, since the step workout works the legs anyway).  Abs are my biggest problem area and I would like to see more videos address them (not just with a handful of crunches that take 5 minutes).  On the days I want to work the legs, buns, and hamstrings, this video does the job big time!",1017532800,18,1287,4.4425531914893615
7840215,5,6303181961,"This video's title says it all.  2 15mins. workouts, both are really great.  Tamilee is great.  You will shed those unwanted pounds and tone and shape with this video.
It is well worth a try.
Enjoy!",992390400,6,198,4.444444444444445
