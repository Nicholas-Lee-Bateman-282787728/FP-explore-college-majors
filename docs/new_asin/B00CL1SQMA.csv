8582947,4,B00CL1SQMA,"This film is advertised as being in Italian with English subtitles. This is wrong. One can click the film to indicate that the language should be English. One can also get English subtitles for the hearing impaired. There is no funny movements when English is used, such as lips still moving after the speech is finished.
I was hoping that the film would be as good as the Clint Eastwood Spaghetti westerns. It has many of the elements of this genre - the long staring without speech, the dress of the men, how they speak, constant frowning, the hero being beat up, and the music - but it is not as good. I was put off by the hero smiling a couple of time, Clint never smiled. Nevertheless, I liked it. There was lots of action.
The story is about two bounty hunters. One is interested in human rights. The other is only interested in money, and he murders people. The villain in the film transports poor Mexicans into the US to work for a cheaper price than the Americans.",1465430400,2,973,4.411111111111111
8582948,3,B00CL1SQMA,"This film was directed in 1969 by Italian director Sergio Garrone, a director that might be better known to some as the director of Nazi exploitation films (not very good by the way), including SS camp women's hell, and SS experiment love camp. This detail is interesting because this spaghetti western is way better than those exploitation films. On this western, bounty hunters Johnny Brandon (Anthony Steffen) and Everett Murdock (William Berger) teams up together in order to take on a ruthless gang of human smugglers working the Mexican border. Of course, you get double crossing between them, lots of shooting, but with little care on showing realistic bullet bloody wounds. Despite that, this is generally a well-made film with a neat final gun-down that you will recognize where the idea came from!! Steffen and especially Berger are pretty cool anti heroes. Berger in particular handles a shotgun with seven barrels. One original point on this film is the depiction of illegal immigration across the US-Mexican border. Overall, this films rates slightly above average, but clearly below any Leone or Corbucci film.

Technically, I do not quite agree with at least one other reviewer. The transfer is of very good quality, yet not what you may be expecting for a Blu-ray format. The image comes in widescreen format. Audio comes in English and Italian, with English subtitles. Extras include an analysis of Garrone's films that remain interesting to me at least. Also included is a nice color booklet on the film and Garrone. The movie runs for 92 minutes.",1429315200,2,1565,5.042471042471043

8582951,4,B00CL1SQMA,"Although the movie is really a fairly mediocre Spaghetti Western, the transfer gives it an extra star in my estimation. It should also be noted that the Amazon specs for the standard DVD are wrong. The aspect ratio is 2.35, as it should be, and it has Italian or English language options. The best thing about the movie itself are the two stars Anthony Steffen and William Berger who are always worth watching.",1389830400,11,410,4.63013698630137
8582952,4,B00CL1SQMA,"Hanging for Django is the English title for Una Lunga Fila di Croci (which translates to A Long Row of Crosses, a much better title) is a low budget film directed by Sergio Garrone and stars Anthony Steffen and William Berger. The film itself is just OK as Spag Westerns go but the Blu Ray transfer is really impressive and a huge improvement over previously available prints of this movie. The editing is somewhat hurky jerky and the plot twists and turns so much towards the end it is hard to keep up with. I do like William Berger in his role as the preacher bounty hunter and how can you go wrong with Mario Brega and Nicoletta Machiavelli. Like I said, not one of the top films of the genre, but worth the price of admission especially with this new transfer.",1384214400,15,764,4.387323943661972
