5074798,5,B007C3W2ZY,"I bought this video about 6-7 months ago b/c I was running my first full marathon in several years and knew I needed to do some sort of cross-training to help with injuries--I've had problems with my hips and knees over the years. I also have 2 young kids so needed something convenient to do at home. I'll admit that at first I wasn't sure if it was helping, but I kept it up a couple of times a week and as I got better at it, I could actually feel myself running straighter and stronger. I ran a second marathon about a month ago and I qualified for Boston for the first time! I'm so amazed that I've had no problems with my hips or knees since I started doing this, and I really believe it's the reason. Just fyi it's pretty hard--I think I'm in pretty good shape but there are a couple of moves (the plank ones) I still have to ""modify"". But overall I'd highly recommend trying this and sticking with it even if it's frustrating at first--I've recommended it to several friends. I just wish she'd come out with a 2nd video b/c now I know this one by heart and there's not much else there designed specifically for runnners!",1368662400,23,1128,4.251162790697674
5074799,5,B007C3W2ZY,Perfect for my training and very useful for my next marathon because I am strengthening my core to run without injuries,1354924800,6,119,4.714285714285714

5074801,4,B007C3W2ZY,Great abs series,1426464000,,16,4.666666666666667
5074802,5,B007C3W2ZY,"Like this DVD , I'm a runner and was looking for DVD to help with stretching because I don't do a good emought job on my own",1423699200,3,124,3.6296296296296298
5074803,5,B007C3W2ZY,Enjoy this workout. I use it on days i don't run.,1421020800,,49,3.5454545454545454
5074804,5,B007C3W2ZY,Just the right exercise to compliment my running program. Many thanks,1412467200,2,69,5.363636363636363
5074805,3,B007C3W2ZY,"Not as difficult as I expected for an ""Intermediate"" session.  Just wish there were more repetitions of each exercise.",1406505600,,118,5.2105263157894735
5074806,4,B007C3W2ZY,"If you are a runner in need of strengthening your core and hips, this is the DVD for you.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I have issues with flexibility and would have liked to have seen more stretching incorporated into the workout, but I can alternate this my yoga for runners DVD for a more rounded weekly fitness regimen.",1394582400,10,333,4.285714285714286
5074807,5,B007C3W2ZY,"I would recommend this DVD to all runners. I've been using it for several months and think it's a great complementary workout. There are specific exercises for many of the neglected areas typical of runners: abs, hip flexors, arms, balance, running form, and flexibility. This workout is challenging but it gets easier after a couple of times.

Also I like this workout because other Pilates/Yoga workouts are too fluffy and peaceful for my taste. This DVD gets to work from the beginning and doesn't have the ""aura of holiness"". Laura Tarbell's instruction is very helpful and the way she explains each exercise is better than I've observed in other Pilates DVDs.",1385769600,7,664,4.981981981981982
5074808,5,B007C3W2ZY,"I absolutely love this dvd!!!!! Laura Tarbell gives excellent instruction and great exercises. There is someone demonstrating modifications and Laura points out modifications. What I particularly love about this dvd is Laura goes from one exercise to the next without annoying pauses. At the same time, I had no problem being ready each time and wasn't fumbling around. I love that the dvd is 56 minutes of instruction. I know there are areas I need to work on. What makes this really great for runners is the part that points out the proper running form and also goes into balance. I am beyond weak in this area. Because of a rotator cuff injury, I skipped the side planks and pushups (how I got this injury 2 years ago. With my hamstring and knee issues I am also skipping the lunges but hope to be able to build up over time.) I am 68 years old and do exercise. I normally don't break into a sweat - but did with this dvd which is a great thing. Laura gives very clear instruction and cueing and reminds us when to breath. She is low key and not annoying.

I highly recommend this dvd to everyone, even non runners because as a competitive former marathoner, I can't run anymore but find this dvd so beneficial. It is definitely a winner.",1378425600,10,1241,4.466960352422907
5074809,5,B007C3W2ZY,My PT recommended Pilates while recovering from a running injury. I saw great results in just a couple of workouts.  Hip and quad weakness improved so much.  I continue to do this DVD twice a week,1375056000,8,196,4.416666666666667
8514167,5,B007C3W2ZY,"Really good workout for runners to supplement workouts, get stronger, correct muscular imbalances, and avoid injuries.",1518048000,,118,6.4375
8514168,5,B007C3W2ZY,"I was looking for a DVD for running and found this one. It is a great DVD and is a good work out no matter what your level of fitness. The breathing that is incorporated In this video has helped me tremendously in my running. In fact apply his breathing is great doing any sort of exercising, especially weightlifting. I bought this DVD for a younger friend of mine who is  just beginning running and she totally loves it. And having a dance background she still find it very challenging! I totally recommend this to anybody who wants to improve their technique for running.",1486684800,,574,4.519230769230769
8514169,4,B007C3W2ZY,"All the exercises are well demonstrated, and well explained.  Only issue is I wish you could select one workout, rather than just where to start the DVD, and there were more clear start and stops to work out sections.",1478563200,,217,4.564102564102564
8514170,5,B007C3W2ZY,Great gift for a runner who wants to get to that next level.,1463443200,,60,3.6923076923076925
8514171,5,B007C3W2ZY,Excellent DVD. Great instruction provided throughout.  I would recommend this pilates work out to non runners also.,1455148800,,115,5.764705882352941
8514172,5,B007C3W2ZY,"It was what I was looking for to target specific areas.  I have a weak hip/side.
The first time I did the first 10 minutes -- I knew it was money well spent.",1445472000,3,157,3.757575757575758
8514173,4,B007C3W2ZY,"Great DVD that really strengthen your core for running. It's not easy, wouldn't recommend it for a complete beginner to Pilates.",1441497600,,128,5.142857142857143
8514174,5,B007C3W2ZY,this is a tuff video too follow for a beginner it should start out a little eayser for my taste but will help you out on yer times,1439337600,,130,3.6785714285714284
8514175,5,B007C3W2ZY,I have been doing this work out for several weeks. It is a nice balance of challenging and doable!,1435017600,,98,4.2105263157894735
8514176,3,B007C3W2ZY,"This is my first time doing Pilates so I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm used to more intense cardiac training, so the slow controlled movements don't seem like much of a workout. There are a few good sessions where you really feel your muscles stretching, but I felt 55 min was a little too long as there are too many short workouts that don't feel like they are doing much good. But, as I said, this is my first time doing Pilates so maybe this is normal.
If you are just starting out, this would be a good starter workout. If you are just starting to train to run, this would be beneficial too. I don't feel this does much good for a seasoned runner though.",1433289600,,660,4.2047244094488185
