4834608,3,B005MAQXNQ,"The storytelling was well done, and fast moving. However, too bad about the animation--very cartoonish. The opening scene was very dimensional and shaded; like a painting. I was looking forward to a visual feast--that went away quickly with the line-drawn flat color-filled characters. Throughout the movie, many of the backgrounds had some of that nice dimensional shading; and I lamented how it could have been: it could have been a masterpiece! Nevertheless, the story content is useful...",1336780800,4,492,5.402597402597403
4834609,5,B005MAQXNQ,"What I liked about this Jesus DVD is that it used historical accounts from the life of Jesus that often get overlooked in other features.  It shared Christ's main teachings and it didn't hold back from telling people they better count the cost of following Jesus.  Followers of Christ can expect persecution from those whose mindset is hostile towards God and His ways.

It was a great approach to set up the Gospel story by telling it through the Apostle John in his old age.  Historically John was exiled to the island prison of Patmos (because the Romans couldn't kill him) and so you can imagine that he would have had many opportunities to share with those there just as this movie featured.

I was also thankful for the extended length of the movie.  Though much more could have been shared, so many other video presentations fall short of the excellence that Voice of the Marytrs put into producing this.",1325289600,30,911,4.6625
4834610,5,B005MAQXNQ,"This is a wonderful DVD.  I have watched this film from the beginning when parts of it were sent to me. As an Artist, I admired the detail in which each frame was put together, making it a wonderful film for adults as well as children.  Every Sunday school and Bible study class should show this one to their students.  The part played by John (the one Jesus loved best) was extraordinary and a take on the story of Jesus, shown in a different way.  I highly recommend it.",1325289600,16,472,4.269662921348314
4834611,5,B005MAQXNQ,"Here what I can summarize after watched this DVD9 (pretend that I am not a Christian):

1) Good news is truly God's good news BUT Christian life is difficult as the movie shows that Jesus followers (the 12) were persecuted.

Nowadays, many preachers give Christians a wrong message that following Christ = happiness and blessing. Sure those things are truly from God but there are such things as the worldly happiness (which isn't what you should want).

2) The eternal life is absolutely free BUT you will be hated by all nations. Keep that in mind before choosing to following Christ.

In the time of the apostles, following Jesus was dangerous. That still remain true today even in USA let alone the rest of the world.

Conclusion:
A merchant found a precious stone (the good news) in a certain field, he went back and sold all he had to purchase that field.

There is and always will be sacrifice to become a Christ followers. Your life will not be easier in fact it could be worst off. But what we are looking at is the salvation on the other side of the tunnel, the Bigger HOPE if you will.

Technical aspect:
+ 3D waters, very good drawings with layers (smog, smoke, grain etc...)
+ Outstanding sound effect... almost like Hollywood.
+ Touchy scenes, tears rolling on my face as I saw Jesus on the cross (I rarely cry by the way).
+ close to the Gospel of John but combine some aspect from other Gospel as well. The first miracle (wedding at Cana) didn't make it to the movie.

Solid 90 minutes of grace.

I would have probably preferred the story told with more of a King James flare, however, it would have not had been as clear and understanding as it was the way it was done.
This is great for children and adults and does not take a way from the power and majesty of our Savior, and truly was done in a way that many could understand and receive the gospel message.

4834662,4,B005MAQXNQ,"Jesus: He Lived Among Us begins on the island of Patmos in the year 96 A.D. Those familiar with their Biblical history will immediately know that John will be of great importance to this film. The scene then shows us an old man (John) and two Roman soldiers questioning how this ancient man could be considered so dangerous that they would need to imprison and isolate him. John informs them that he would not worship the emperor, because there was only one true God. They then go on to talk about how there had been many attempts on John's life, but that he would not die. This is highly accurate, but it surprised me that they made mention of it, as I got a bit of a Protestant vibe from the film. John then tells the story of Jesus, and the remaining 99% of the film is a flashback.

The flashback begins with the Annunciation and quickly escalates to the Flight into Egypt. As Catholics we know about the deaths of all those babies, the Holy Innocents, that gave their life so Jesus could be saved, but we tend to gloss over them when reading in Scripture. After the Flight into Egypt, we flash forward approximately thirty years to Jesus' baptism by His cousin John the Baptist. The rest of the film focuses on Jesus' ministry. We see His teachings, His miracles, and those whose lives were changed by Him. However, there is a constant shadow being cast by the Pharisees in this film. They are always in the background grumbling and plotting. Again, this is something we know, but not something we always focus on. We also see the Passion, the Resurrection, and Jesus talking to Peter after His Resurrection. The film then ends with a bit of a Protestant altar call. Old John tells what he believes, why he knows it to be true, and asks,  ""Now that you have heard the story, what will you believe?""

Overall, I was impressed with this movie. You never know what you are going to get when you have an animated tale of Jesus, but this one was VERY Scriptural. There were times when it felt like some of the miracles were out of order, and there was one very tough scene to explain to your kids in the form of Judas' hanging on the tree. It didn't show him commit the act, but you could see the tree shaking and then it panned out and revealed him hanging there. Yes, I know this is accurate, but it was jarring for me to see and raised questions among younger children. Overall, I would still recommend this move. Just be prepared to field tough questions on some of the scenes.",1434067200,,2481,4.4126637554585155

potential in church classrooms to introduce viewers to the ongoing role of suffering in Christian witness.  We passed our copy
on to our son for possible use at his church.",1366761600,2,433,4.5256410256410255
4834690,5,B005MAQXNQ,"I have been trying to find a good cartoon on the life of Jesus for a while now.  I have found ones that show parts of his life very  well, but nothing that shows the life and teachings of Jesus Christ in a comprehensive manner, yet one which kids will enjoy and be able to follow.  This is that movie.  Remarkably well done.  The animation is as good as that of any available today, the music is very well done, and the editing is good.  It in many ways is the animated version of Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ without all the gore.  It begins with John, the last surviving Apostle, relaying to two Roman guards why he is willing to be imprisoned on the island of Patmos for the sake of his belief in Jesus Christ as God.  Then, for the next 80 minutes we see a beautiful rendition of the life of Jesus, showing all the major events, often briefly but still with good clarity.  Though even small children will enjoy this cartoon, the movie does not stray from quoting extensively from the Gospel of St. John (and other parts of the New and Old Testaments), so it is just as good (or even better) for older kids.  It has by far the best portrayal of Jesus' cleansing of the Temple that I have ever seen in a movie or cartoon. Also, the portrayal of Jesus being tempted by the devil in the desert is simply amazing--an amazing visual representation of what happened.  The Passion of Jesus is shown with great drama, not ignoring some of the most troublesome parts (Jesus sweating blood, Judas hanging himself, Jesus being scourged and nailed to the cross).  However, besides very small children (pre-school)for whom it may be too much (for my children it wasn't), it is not too graphic, but makes children understand how tragic this was and how much Jesus Christ suffered to redeem our sins.  My only criticism of the movie is that it omits the Ascension of Jesus into Heaven (something my children noticed right away), but otherwise this movie reaches near perfection in portraying the life of Christ.  Even as an adult, I enjoyed this rendition of the life of Christ more than any other movie with the exception of the now legendary Passion of the Christ.",1365984000,4,2160,4.491048593350383
4834691,4,B005MAQXNQ,"My family watched this on Easter weekend.  The kids started out grumbling about not wanting to watch it, but after about 5 minutes into it they were completely engrossed.  They asked many questions which presented opportunities for my husband and I to explain biblical truth to them.  This movie was excellent.  We had some playback issues and the voices were not syncing up with the lips, but that probably had more to do with our internet service.

Highly recommend for young/elementary aged children!!",1365033600,2,504,5.024096385542169

I found out it's a very accurate version of the life of Christ. I am very happy that my 8 year old kid can know the whole truth. Great work!",1363737600,,265,3.8363636363636364
4834693,3,B005MAQXNQ,"I wanted to buy this film, but decided to preview it before doing so.  I've seen many animated Bible Story films.  Some of them have been about Jesus.  Its nice, but at times it does slow down a bit, even for adults (kids will walk away at some point).  I was suprised at seeing the characters themselves be ""cartoons"", while the backgrounds and scenarios were more ""animated""; which I did find disappointing in this day and age of technology.  Additionally, the movement of the characters, especially when they speak, does not match well with the audio; it becomes a turn-off, at least for me.

IF YOU are considering purchasing this film, I advise you to preview it first and decide for yourself.",1362528000,,698,4.680327868852459
4834694,5,B005MAQXNQ,This cartoon is AWESOME!! To sum it up its a animated version of the movie King of Kings but uses a much simpler dialog for children to understand. We watched it first as a family and liked it so much I now use it as an aid to teach kids Christian Education Classes.,1362355200,,266,4.037735849056604
4834695,4,B005MAQXNQ,"We really liked this movie, thought it was well done and portrayed Jesus well.  We did not like the scene where it shows judas hanging himself, a scene I don't really want my children to see, so we have to fast forward through that scene. Other than that it is a great movie.",1358899200,2,275,4.188679245283019

4834697,5,B005MAQXNQ,Fantastic Video.  Sat and watched it with my family.  We all really appreciated the work done and the fact the story stuck to what was written in the Bible.  Very good.,1352073600,2,168,4.354838709677419
4834698,5,B005MAQXNQ,"I don't see anything wrong with a bit of addition to the story to make it interesting enough that kids would watch the whole thing without getting bored; it doesnt change the overall story, just makes it more watchable. Having read and seen other video accounts of the Gospel story many times, I thought this covered all of the important parts of the story and was very captivating to watch. The animation seemed very colorful and adequate to me; I doubt they had a $300 million budget to work with; the story was the main point, not to impress with flashy technology. I very highly recommend. If I had more money I would buy them by the boxes of 10 and distribute to everyone I know who has a child, or anyone for that matter. The makers of this film obviously care very greatly about the message of the Gospel, I don't understand why some people always feel the need to be critical and try to ruin things for others.",1344124800,6,918,4.405882352941177
4834699,1,B005MAQXNQ,"Yes, the animation is very ""old school"" like I grew up with in the 1980's, but what was more concerning to me was the deviation from Scripture that this contains.  The back of the video claimed it was based upon the Gospel of John... but yet then contained stories of Christ's birth from Luke and Matthew.  What makes that worse, though, is that they were inaccurately portrayed.
I don't know why we keep trying videos for kids about Scripture as they are pretty much all inaccurate.  The Nest family of videos were also disappointing.  From now on, unless we know the script is word for word Scripture, I doubt we'll be giving any more another chance.
If you want something more biblical that kids could still understand, you might want to try Matthew of the Visual Bible.  While it's much longer, it's actually word for word Scripture and well done.  My kids enjoyed it.",1343001600,4,872,4.62987012987013
4834700,1,B005MAQXNQ,"I really wanted to like this film.  I expected being from Voice of the Martyrs that it would be accurate.  However, we could only watch about 15 minutes before we got completely disgusted with it.  The Bible's account of Christ is sufficient--you do not need to add in ""extra"" details to make it more entertaining (for adults or children).  This film also took alot of creative license, and in doing so, inaccurately portrayed Scripture. (and this is only from the 1st 15 minutes or so) We only want our children to see accurate portrayals of Scripture. I dare you to watch this with your Bible in your lap and compare what you see to what is in Scripture.",1343001600,5,656,4.533898305084746
4834701,5,B005MAQXNQ,"I liked the way the story was told with John's narration from his confinement on the Isle of Patmos. I've read the gospels and even an amalgamated ""Life of Jesus"" which takes the gospels and aligns them in sequence, and this movie does a great job highlighting much of the very important context. The portions that it couldn't cover completely it seemed to at least mention them: like the feeding of the 5000 and 3000. Lacking are many of His parables, but the movie is captivating and enlightening nonetheless. My kids were glued to it and I'm looking forward to the many questions and discussions that it has and will generate. It's a great introduction o the life of Christ and his disciples, and I think it will encourage many children (and adults) to seek out more truth by reading their bibles. As for the animation: it's no ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"" but at least it's no ""Yogi Bear"" either. I'd rank it average or slightly above, and since I didn't buy it for the animation but for the story, I believe it deserves high marks and praise.",1336953600,8,1047,4.544973544973545

8479307,5,B005MAQXNQ,"I really liked this animated version of Jesus.  The depiction of the pharisees as clearly antagonistic toward Jesus and the temple scene captured very well the intensity of Jesus and his righteous anger toward the religious leaders who did not really know the scriptures or love God.  The story was simple and the characters well done in the way that made me feel emotionally attached to their plight as a good story about the life of Jesus should.  In all I know that children watching this drama will understand why the Jewish leaders crucified Jesus and that God was in control of the situation all along.  The animation is lovely and the expressions depicting the emotions of the characters are excellent for animation... I really enjoyed watching the subtleties in the animation.  The detractors are being hypercritical.  Every detail would have made this story too long for children.  The only disappointment was that in the scene where Jesus is about to be arrested and he says ""I am"" in answer to the soldiers question... is that the soldiers did not fall backward as is stated in the Gospel of John.  I think that would have been awesome as Jesus is actually stating that is is God as he did in the burning bush when Moses asked who he was.  Great artistic endeavor to tell the ""Good News"".  I will buy a copy for myself.",1522800000,,1330,4.645299145299146

8479309,2,B005MAQXNQ,"This production of the Gospel, doesn't pull any punches. literally.  Get ready for punching and slapping, etc...  Imagine reading through the gospels and taking every violent part from them and condensing them into one made-for-kids-cartoon. This is it. It overemphasizes strife, contention and violence. Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with watering down the gospel at all. I agree mankind is antichrist by default and hates God by default. Yes, we are all seriously depraved.  But I also don't agree with disproportionately portraying the story in the manner this did. This production finds it's strength in being trigger happy on the violence and contempt. There are some moments of peace when Christ is on the scene but it's short lived. I really don't like story lines that build and build on all of the negative things you wouldn't want your kids to see with their eyes and hear with their ears and then throw in the moral of the story in the last few minutes. By that time, they've already received an impartation of all the negative things. Try not to think of a purple elephant, a very large purple elephant with one ear that's bright yellow. You can't not think of it because the image went into your mind by reading the description. It's the same with your kids watching 30 minutes for violence and strife and then getting to the punchline of the Cross and Resurrection at the end. Now what!? Isn't there a way to lead children to Christ and to the power of the gospel without over emphasizing the negative behavior of man above the other glories that Christ did as he walked the earth and as God continues to do through the Holy Spirit?  I think that there needs to be balance and certainly if you're going to put a cartoon Jesus on the cover and market this to children. It needs to be appropriate for their impressionable minds. I do not recommend that you allow your children to watch this. But if you do, take note of their behavior so you can see for yourself if there's a connection.",1518393600,,2003,4.617977528089888
8479310,2,B005MAQXNQ,"The movie is not bad for older children, but was too dramatic and violent for my little ones.  They were having bad dreams after watching it. I'm saving it until they are quite a bit older (10-12?)",1510617600,,197,4.324324324324325

8479312,2,B005MAQXNQ,"This version tells the truth without watering it down, but I can only give it two stars because I felt like the acting was fairly bad. Jesus is 33, but his voice actor sounds like a old man. Most of the disciples' voice actors are bad too.
Also, this was a bit too graphic, in my opinion, for children. It shows Judas hanging himself from a tree and blood spurting out as they whipped Jesus. Again, I know that's what actually happened, but it was too intense for my 6yr old and we had to turn it off.",1504137600,,501,4.122448979591836
