7977077,5,B00007JZW6,This anime is funny but short I'd like to see more ova's in the future but for what it is I enjoyed it. Filled with fan service and just funny regular anime jokes,1407196800,,162,3.9393939393939394

7977079,3,B00007JZW6,"With only 6 episodes, Amazing Nurse Nanako doesn't have the time for a well-developed story.  Some may say that there is no story at all but this show does indeed have a plot, however simple it may be.  As can be seen from the covers, the show serves mostly as a fanservice showcase and has a fair amount of comedy.
The character designs are great but the video quality is poor.  There are rainbow effects in most of the scenes.  The audio is a basic stereo track.  The menus on all 3 discs are well done and there are more extras on these discs than on most other anime DVDs.  Warning: some of the extras contain scenes from episodes you may not have watched yet.
Then there's the wonderful box.  There have been many compliments on the box and they are well-deserved.  I don't want to ruin the surprise so you'll just have to get it to see it! P>Recommended for fans of beautiful character designs and fanservice, and fans who are looking for a short, fun series.  Otherwise, stay away if you are looking for a deep story.",1045353600,8,1024,4.375661375661376
