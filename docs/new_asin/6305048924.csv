7881492,5,6305048924,"I LOVED seeing these old episodes of Zoom!  i remember watching it on tv when I was a kid.  My bff and I have watched this several times!  I only wish it was longer, and there was more skits or complete episodes, and it was on DVD!!!",1362528000,,233,3.9148936170212765

really keeps my grandsons attention. These are his favorite videos.",1360108800,,126,5.35
7881494,5,6305048924,"I believe the public broadcasting system  should release entire episodes of the original ZOOM series from 1972 - 1976.

I also would like the television industry to consider a  network channel dedicated to just 70s Childrens' programming ( The Magic Garden, New Zoo Revue, Electric Company, Romparoom, Kid Power (Wee Pals)etc.  Boomerang and TVLand are a good start but are missing this scope in particular.  These shows are a refreshing look-back to when you could be an aware, thinking individual  and not get crammed with reality show spin-offs.",1197849600,2,548,5.170454545454546
7881495,5,6305048924,"WBGH and PBS, thanks for putting out this videotape.  I'd really love it if you could release all the 70's Zoom Episodes.  That would be so incredible.  Please put them out as Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, Season 4, and so on and so on.  But it's an incredible tape to see and it brought back nice situations and memories to remember.  Thanks for putting this tape out and I appreciate it.

Thanks.",1136764800,2,398,4.3108108108108105
7881496,5,6305048924,"This brings back such wonderful memories!  The video is an outstanding collection of clips from the hit 70's TV show - - the first show ever made for kids by kids.  I only hope that WGBH releases more editions - - I would very much like to see something akin to ""the best of season 1"" or ""the best musical numbers"", etc. - - what we have so far just whets the appetite!  I've now seen it many times and am thoroughly entertained by each viewing.  And - - surprise bonus - - my 18-month old son can't get enough of it!",1037491200,,517,4.03921568627451
