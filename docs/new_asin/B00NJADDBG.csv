8678673,5,B00NJADDBG,"First, Id like to say I don't understand how Amazon can allow the other reviewer to give a bad review to a video he admits hes never actually watched.  My copy of Swiss Lakes (and the Grand Tetons) both play fine on all of my dvd players, including my computer.  They have held up over time and are certainly a high-quality product.
  Furthermore, I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!  The scenery from start to finish takes me out of my domestic environment and transports me through the the LOVELY Swiss countryside.  The detail is phenomenal and I notice it more every time I watch it.  Today I was looking at the different flags in the first cute town as I rode down the main street under the pointed rooftops.  Later I found myself wondering about the history of a certain castle next to Lake Neuchatel and Im about to search Google to find out more.  The collection of the five different lakes in Switzerland is especially nice since you can compare and contrast their surrounds.
 Since I can no longer travel abroad, this is the next best thing.  I love all my Bike-O-Vision videos but the Swiss Lakes has a special place in my virtually travels :- )",1497830400,,1141,4.490291262135922

Among them, this title was impressive with the lake scenery.
I think it is well produced and manufactured.
If possible, I'd like to see them with good music.
Thank you.",1425859200,,223,4.894736842105263
