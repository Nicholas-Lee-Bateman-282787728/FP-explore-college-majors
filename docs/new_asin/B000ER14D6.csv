8113587,5,B000ER14D6,One of Russ Meyer's Best Movies! Weird but awesome,1431216000,,50,4.666666666666667
8113588,5,B000ER14D6,"Russ Meyer.  Creative guy, boob aficionado, stern director.  This movie demonstrates Russ's attributes to a fault.

Visually, the movie is beautifully-directed, with a lush rural setting, beautiful women displayed in the (1970s-trimmed) altogether, and vivid cinematography throughout.

The acting is a mixed bag, certainly, but there's some legitimate talent here.  Lines are delivered with gusto and clarity, tense moments look tense (within the parody elements, naturally), and the sexin' looks silly-sexy.  All softcore, to be sure, but it's fun to watch anyway.  That's a problem, of course, because there are several points at which the sexin' is completely non-consentual!  Misogyny is an easy accusation to level at Russ, but the intensity and ubsurdity of it all definitely remove a lot of the ""danger"" one would feel here.

The plot is...wacky.  I won't give away spoilers, but it's a murder mystery in a small town where folks cavort in the woods, a lumberjack drinks at a diner, and the police are as gleefully corrupt as can be.  Anything more would give it away.  Suffice it to say, if you like satiric 1970s humor, abundant female nudity, and a bizarre plot that reveals itself at a leisurely pace, you might give this a try.",1397520000,,1240,5.084158415841584
