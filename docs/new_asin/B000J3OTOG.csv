2666801,4,B000J3OTOG,"Epic is often something we attribute to lengthy films or ones that have a cast of nearly a hundred or more. LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962) quickly comes to mind. It had an all-star cast and a run time of over 220 minutes. DOCTOR ZHIVAGO (1965) is another, clocking in at just over 190 minutes. Then there's the more modern ""epics"" such as GLADIATOR (2000) that comes in at 171 minutes.

But run times are only a portion of what makes an epic an epic. THE HOUSE OF SAND runs well under two hours (115 minutes), but spans multiple generations, covering over 60 years. And although The House of Sand teeters on the verge epic-ness, it misses the mark ...but only by a hair.

Visually breathtaking, The House of Sand focuses on the lives of three generations of women. The first generation is forced into a little known desert area of Brazil where a man named Vasco (Ruy Guerra) leads a ragtag group of settlers on a quest for land to call their own. With him comes his wife Aurea (Fernanda Torres), a young woman of an arranged marriage. Also with him is Aurea's mother, Maria (Fernanda Montenegro). The group of settlers quickly learn the inhospitable nature of the area and all of them flee, except for Vasco, Aurea, and Maria. But Vasco soon dies in an accident, leaving the mother/daughter team to fend for themselves. Luckily, there's a group of former slaves eking out an existence nearby. Massu (Seu Jorge) is one of these tough ex-slaves, and he takes a liking to Aurea (as do several other men who live or happen upon this sandy area).

As time passes, Maria falls in love with the dunes and the simplicity of the area. But Aurea begs to leave. She wants for the excitement of a city with people her own age. Several options for freeing herself from the boredom of the sand appear and just as quickly evaporate, stranding her year after year in the desolation. One time, however, a young officer in the Brazilian Army visits the area with scientists who are marking an eclipse of the sun, and a quick one-night-stand results in a pregnancy. The officer leaves and Aurea is once again stuck in this place. Her daughter (Maria) grows and looks exactly like Aurea. And as Aurea ages, she has a striking resemblance to her mother, Maria. Roles get reversed after Aurea's mother's death in a sand slide. Aurea must now be the responsible mother to her daughter Maria. But Maria's life in this place is adding up to zero. Sound familiar?

The circular pattern of family has been done before, but never on par with this. The sweeping vistas, quiet yet constantly shifting sands, and the pressing of dunes on everything (including the women's relationships) make this film a very good story. But not a great one.

The short run time forces two quick decade leaps that are, to say the least, jarring and confusing. Also, the excellent cinematography lingered just a bit too long on occasion whenever sweeping scenery presented itself (""Yeah, that's beautiful ...still beautiful ...yep, still great ...is it still on the screen?"")

This is one of director Andrucha Waddington's first feature length films and one can't help but be impressed by his able hands on the helm. It is a magnificent piece of cinema that needed just a few touch-ups in order to be ""Epic.""",1167955200,12,3254,4.670157068062827
2666802,3,B000J3OTOG,"Note: Portuguese with English subtitles.

`The House of Sand' is a visually haunting but unbearably slow story about a husband, his wife Aurea and her Mother journeying across a hot, endless array of  sand dunes to a remote location in Brazil to live a semi-secluded existence on a small oasis surrounded by never-ending sand drifts.

After the death of the husband the women are left to fend for themselves. With the help of a small nearby black community close to the ocean, they are able to scrap out an existence that soon extends to ten years or more. Aurea made pregnant by her husband shortly before his untimely death, has given birth to a little girl named Maria. Will the longstanding dream of escaping from their sandy confinement and returning to the outside world the viewer is left to wonder if this hope will ever come into fruition. Or have the three women found something unexpected in their enforced solitude that provides a meaning to life that was totally unexpected.

Other reviewers have made mention of the allegorical nature of this film; the Divine Feminine, the Triple Goddess, etc. Yes I can see their point and approaching the film on that mythic level does add an ample amount to insight and texture to what otherwise appears a study in futility for those involved. However for me, these mythic connections appear more contrived than inherent in the script and simply aren't enough to lift this film to the next level.

I can't say I recommend it, but it may be worthwhile to viewers willing to become absorbed in the landscape and the daily mundane activities of life on the sand.",1167696000,7,1610,4.756272401433692
2666803,5,B000J3OTOG,"I must confess, I watched the film after reading Grady's wonderful review, as he and I are usually in synch; and it even exceeded my expectations.

While the movie is visually spectacular from the opening scene, it is the way it weaves this haunting tale of the divine Feminine that stays with you long after the closing credits.

Not only do the three generations of women represent the Mother Maiden Crone form of the Triple Goddess, the latter day Maria appears in red sneakers, corresponding to Dorothy's red shoes from the Wizard of Oz - in both cases, representing the moonblood of the sacred Feminine.

Even the one graphic sex/love scene between Aurea and Massu is beautifully and tastefully filmed, and the passion is entirely believable, down to the subtle capture of Fernanda Torres's erect nipples.

The film's many themes, including the futility of doing or not-doing, give the viewer much to consider as they feast on this masterpiece of acting, cinematography, casting, production, direction, you name it.

This is a must-see film by any standards.",1166832000,6,1063,5.017045454545454
2666804,5,B000J3OTOG,"CASA DE AREIA ('HOUSE OF SAND) is a masterpiece of filmmaking from Brazil.  Written by Elena Soarez and Luis Carlos Barreto the story seems more a magical metaphor than a tale of real life - until the film concludes and the immediacy and universality of the messages haunt the viewer's mind for hours.  It is a film directed by Andrucha Waddington with a cast of superb actors but the focus of the film, the films central character, is the bleak isolation of the sweeping desert of Northern Brazil.

The film opens in 1910 with a caravan of wind swept characters appearing in the distance of the dunes of the desert, a group of wayfarers apparently escaping the poverty of the bog city to find a home of their own, land that can be called something that belongs to them.  They are led by  Vasco de S (Ruy Guerra) and his wife urea (Fernanda Torres) and her mother Dona Maria (Fernanda Montenegro), both of whom plead with Vasco to let them return to the poverty of the city instead of being forced to attempt to exist in the sands of the windy desert.  Vasco is determined, builds a house, forces the women to live there and the others to pitch tents to exist.  urea becomes pregnant, Vasco is confronted by the real owners of the land led by Massu (Seu Jorge), and must trade his possessions to remain in his 'home', a home which crashes around him leaving Vasco dead and  urea and Dona Maria to fend for themselves.  The others desert the two women and the women find their only help in Massu.

Time passes slowly (to 1919) and the changing sands begin to bury the house.  urea, now a mother of a daughter Maria (Camilla Facundes),  finds a telescope and sets out to see if she can find its owner and a way out of the desert. She encounters a group of scientists photographing the solar eclipse, a group protected by Luiz (Enrique Daz) who bonds with urea, has a night affair with her, and then promises to take urea, her old mother Dona Maria, and her young daughter Maria to the city.  urea sets out for her house only to find it now covered with a dune, her mother dead and her daughter Maria traumatized: the chance for escape is gone.

We move to 1942 and daughter Maria is now a woman (played by Fernanda Montenegro) who has bonded with Massu (now played by Luiz Melodia) and her sensual daughter Maria (played by Fernanda Torres) are still waiting for the return of Luiz.  The older Luiz (Stnio Garcia) returns and Maria seduces him, even though Luiz knows she is his old lover's daughter.  He returns to the house, meets the 'urea/Maria' he loved and ultimately agrees to take the younger Maria to the city: the older Maria elects to stay with Massu.  Again time leaps to 1970 and the younger Maria in hippie outfit drives out to see her mother (both Marias are now played by Fernanda Montenegro) and the reunion of hopes and dreams of over 60 years are realized in a manner that brings the film to a haunting conclusion.

The cast is extraordinarily fine, blending into the movement of nature and symbolizing the elements of love, longing, loneliness, destiny, and survival.  The repeated use of the two major actresses is a stroke of genius: we are caught up in the intuitive understanding of all the manifestations of these two women over time as they change roles not only as actresses but also as blending characters.

In a fine touch of genius, the films credits are rolled as Brazilian pianist Nelson Friere plays the Chopin 'Raindrop Prelude'.  It is a moving ending to a magnificent film.  Highly recommended. In Portuguese with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, December 06",1166313600,22,3591,4.56786271450858
2666805,5,B000J3OTOG,"Can't comment on the DVD features, as I had the pleasure of catching this at the local art theatre. Just wanted to comment on the wonderful lingering effect this film had on me.

The movie follows a husband and wife (with her elderly mother) along with their crew back in 1910 as they venture out into the Brazilian deserts to settle at a spot in which the husband believes to be a sort of paradise. After the crew escapes and the husband becomes vicious and insane, the pregnant wife and her mother find themselves alone in the desert as the husband dies in a mishap.

The story then follows the three generations of women who struggle to escape the sands. The film spans about 50 years and features tons of foreshadowing and existential musings along with some excellent performances. This is a fine South American piece up there with Central Station and City of God.

A must see for all lovers of fine film.",1164499200,5,910,4.536585365853658

2666824,5,B000J3OTOG,"I have never reviewed a movie before and won't really now except to suggest that this film, intentionally or otherwise is a a marvelous, deeply spiritual film. It's very aridity and sparseness; its tearing asceticism in the cell that is the beautiful, silent dunes is a cry of conscious creation looking for fulfillment and except for love, finding only sand.

I cannot speak for the writers, and perhaps this review is more about me, but this searing movie is a deep treatise on vanity; the vanity of Ecclesiastes; inching painfully, almost lifelessly along in time yet jolting into new lives, new eras, new vanities,this film speaks its deep, dare I say religious truth that the material, the ephemeral, yesterday's ""new"" passion, cannot even begin to fill the living soul.

Escape. Fly from our existential feet of clay to the moon and still, you will find there to your surprise, that all around you is the same dust and sand.

The sole hint of exception to this reality that so mocks our new cars and modern gross conceits, our scientisms and inane philosophies of the ephemeral and merely material, is the love.

Love appears, noticeably in the stories of those wanderings in the deserts real and metaphorical, partial and distracted love, normal human love, though it be. Practical and temporal or eroticly passive and disconnected from our internal law, its appearance howsoever fractured and incomplete nevertheless hints at what is not just sand, not just vanity, not just dead.

Only the love, fractured and disjointed for these people wandering aimlessly in the desert is not sand, and life in the end must be about love, or sand.  The comings and goings of war and science and moonshots is just background noise and distraction, a further background vanity to the great silent and interior story played out in our minds and hearts.

All the rest is just so much sand. In our cells; in our deserts, we  can only strip away the vain and hope to find the silent presence of love, the the sublime principle of unity and sole hope of meaning. This is no sloppy, decadent erotic escapism, but love that is about responsibility for and commitment to life, and lifegivers emerging through the grains of sand that seem to comprise our hourglasses of life. The quiet, almost inaudible voices of the great spiritual seekers and leaders of human history resonate in this powerful meditation.

Gently we are led to realize that this path can offer any hope of freedom  from the ubiquitous, grating, wearing and temporal tyranny of sand. And we are reminded that despite our longings, it has the power to swallow and smother us if we can only see the sand in the hourglass of our lives, an not the love that gives it glimpses of meaning

I loved this movie.

2666825,5,B000J3OTOG,"Story opens in 1910 when Vasco, a fanatical Brazilian in search for prosperity, treks from an urban Brazilian city across the deserts of Northern Brazil.  He ultimately settles in a desolate, sun parched area of the desert adjacent to an oasis...but it's mostly sand and more sand.

In his wake, come his pregnant wife (Maria), who he bought, and her aging mother (Aurea) - both unwilling participants in this journey.  Through a series of incidents, the mother and daughter are abandoned and are forced to survive - and they do so with the help of descendants of runaway slaves in a coastal fishing village.  Feeling trapped in the ""nothingness"" of the desert, Maria and then later her daughter (another Maria) make numerous attempts to escape back to the ""real world.""  The full story covers 60 years.

You can feel the despair and suffocation of the main actors trapped in this isolated part of civilization.  You are mesmerized by the beauty of the dunes and the ocean lapping the shoreline - there is beautiful cinematography throughout.  Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, a mother and daughter in real life - play the mother (Aurea) and daughter (Maria) in this performance - they are both magnificent.

You eventually see that Maria, like her Mother, finds out what really is important in life - some food to eat, safety, your family and good health.",1210464000,,1364,4.895652173913043

2666827,3,B000J3OTOG,"Vasco leads his wife, urea (Fernanda Torres) and her aging mother (the very talented, Fernanda Montenegro) to desolate parts of Maranho desert (strikingly beautiful and rugged). They come across what seems like a tiny creek amongst sand dunes and decide to call it their base. Things start going wrong right away as they get unwanted guests (village locals). Vasco manages to barter a deal with the locals and sells some of his animal stock to get building material for a house. urea attempts to bribe members of Vasco's caravan (by slipping them some money) to help her escape back to civilization. However, they double-cross her and run away with the remaining livestock and the money. Vasco in a fit of rage slips and falls to his death. urea (pregnant) & her mother are stranded in the desert.
This marks the beginning of a saga for them as they struggle to build a shelter. Helps comes from a diffident local called Massu, who offers them some salted fish and also plants a palm tree in front of urea's house. A working relationship develops between urea and Massu's family. Years pass by. urea's daughter has grown up & her mother aged. However, urea never abandons hope and attempts to leave the desert; though her mother doesn't want to leave any more. One day, urea walks far and away from home and reaches a small camp that is being run by visiting scientists. An officer from the group promises to drive urea back to civilization. urea is delighted and runs back to her house. However, shifting sand dunes have crushed the house, killing her mother. Her daughter survives.
urea loses hope and whilst in deep sorrow enters into a relationship with Massu. The reserved Massu is selfish doesn't tell urea about the caravan's return and seals her chance of getting back.
urea's daughter doesn't approve of her mother's relationship with Massu and grows up to be a rebel with a passion for casual promiscuous relationship with local men. Years pass by. urea & Massu have grown old and her daughter has grown up (the daughter's role played now played by Fernanda Torres and urea's by Fernanda Montenegro). Now, urea is the one who doesn't want to return. One day, the caravan of scientists returns yet again. urea's convinces the officer to take her daughter back to civilization.
Years pass by and urea's daughter returns to the small village (now played by Fernanda Montenegro) to meet her mother. She tells urea that man has reached the moon. urea asks her if they found anything over there. ""Dust"" replies her daughter.

The story is weaved like a spiritual parable. This is especially true about the concluding dialogs around man's conquest of moon and finding dust (which seems rather surprising to the women who have spent a better part of their lives in dust/sand-ridden desert). The movie is very slow and long silent shots. There are moments, when it'll seem irritating, but then there are moments when it'll seem pleasantly philosophical and beautiful. However, it ends on a philosophical note. We humans are searching relentlessly for happiness in far-away place when in reality it is all around us in subtle and hidden forms.  The highlight of the movie is the surreal landscape and effortless acting by Fernanda Montenegro.",1186099200,3,3242,4.871376811594203
2666828,5,B000J3OTOG,"HOUSE OF SAND was a surprise Brazilian film that far exceeded its neo-realistic goal and turned into a lush visually rich saga of three generations of women living in the vast desert wastelands of northern Brazil.

Anchored by veteran actress Fernanda Montenegro (in multiple and multi-generational roles) this film was amazingly filmed in the highest definition for commercial cinema under extremely challenging desert conditions. I have seen Fernanda Montenegro in another highly acclaimed film ""CENTRAL STATION"", where she reached up to wider emotional palate.

In HOUSE OF SAND, Mnntenegro has almost allowed the shifting desert sands to become a co-actor in telling this powerful intergenerational story spanning a period from 1910 through 1960.

Indeed, the film-maker's first stroke of genius in choosing a 2K high-definition format to film this ensured that each grain of sand was clearly visible as the dunes shifted in the winds devouring all forms of shelter forcing the extremely poor inhabitants of the land to move away constantly from its path.

The resulting visual impact of the story is like very few films I have seen. I suspect, barring documentaries, not many feature-filmmakers would bother to use a desert location as vast and as barren to tell such a rich visually stirring film, resisting the use of artificial studio sound-stage and sets. Instead recreating an entire desert settlement at a remote location hundreds of miles away from nearest civilization is a testimony to the director's conviction to this production.

BE SURE TO WATCH THIS FILM ON A GOOD LARGE-SCREEN HDTV AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I MEAN !!!

2666830,3,B000J3OTOG,"it is a stark movie, filmed in a starkly beautiful but desolate land, at the intersection of sand and sea in Brazil.
I constantly asked myself how can anyone survive let alone raise children in such a land. There is apparently nothing but sand and saltwater, crabs and a few coconuts. Their goats and small gardens as well as the sea are the only sources of food, even salt has to be brought in. The sand is everywhere, eventually moving and completely recreating the landscapes, it swallows the houses and shapes the consciousness of those living there.

It is the story of 3 women, grandmother, mother and daughter. It uses an odd technique of jumping ahead decades without any clues and swapping the actresses, the mother is played by the actress who was the grandmother and daughter by the actress who was daughter. I missed this the first time and had to rewind and see that watching (subtitled, in Brazilian Portuguese) the names is crucial, not the faces.

The two, grandmother and mother (who is just pregnant) arrive with a stark raving mad husband in this cruel and unforgiving land. He soon dies and leaves the two women to survive or die, the land doesn't care.
It is a bit disorientating, which is apparently the author's design, landmarks are wiped out by the moving sand. The mother wants desperately to return and tries to walk out, to bargain a ride out, to wait for an expedition that was working on the 1919 solar eclipse and Einstein's theory. It is a story of consequences, situation A leads to situation B, but both time and this disconcerting disorientation make the transition anything but straightforward.

This deliberate disorientation is increased by almost meaningless or even anti-meaning events, why after decades does the mother have this passionate moment. Why does the daughter flip out when she sees it.
I don't think that the daughter says a word until the last few minutes as a middle aged woman and a monologue with her now very elderly mom.
in a way it all seems rather pointless and existentialist like ""No Exit"" or ""Waiting for Godot"", life is just life, live it or don't, the sand/universe doesn't care

The major situations are: mother's passion leads to daughter's promiscuity, nothingness of the environment leads to nothing to do and nothing inside the daughter, an overwhelming desire to leave makes the acknowledgment that this is home and a place to cherish and grow old in unrecognized. The curious point of the movie is to see how aging changes each woman so she becomes more like her mother, with the mother eventually deciding to stay when given an opportunity to leave presents itself, which the daughter takes.

So it is a movie about time, about growing old, about maturity with the constant background of the shifting and unstoppable sand.
It destroys house, destroys lives, disorientates the viewer yet moves so slowly that you have to pay attention to see the changes.
Like life which reflects the passage of time, most of the real work is done unseen, slowly but inexorably.

The lessons of the movie are as much achieved by the landscape as by the characters and plot, actually more so, for there is little dialog.
i think that the movie will appeal to some people and bore many, much like sitting and watching a sand dune would be.
but it is worthwhile watching, even if in fast forward, if only for the scenery. i had no idea places like this even existed.

anyhow. use the pause key, look carefully at the scenes and pay attention to the names of the women, not the faces, for the passage of time is marked only by the names, not the faces or the clothes.",1185062400,6,3619,4.716772151898734

Director Andrucha Waddington's allegorical sand swept domestic epic of a woman searching for a home where the heart is, moves through three generations of hardship, lust and love, and the pursuit of a freedom as evident and unreachable as the moon. Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres make a compelling mother and daughter team, (in real life they are indeed mother and daughter), and aside from an unconvincing account of a girl becoming an aimless, boozing flirt, after witnessing a lovemaking session with mommy and stepdad, the film is a beauty, probing gently into one's time and place on our civilized planet.",1183852800,,805,4.926470588235294
2666832,5,B000J3OTOG,"Before I say even a word about the film as a whole, I have to acknowledge HOUSE OF SAND's sound mix as the most impressive use of Dolby 5.1 I have ever heard.  For audiophiles, that may be reason enough to own this movie.  I'll return to that in a minute.

As a film, HOUSE OF SAND is both strikingly original and oddly familiar.  To encapsulate it would be impossible without resorting to fanciful analogy:  if novelist Willa Cather were to meet up with John Ford and Terence Malick in an opium den, the three of them might dream up something like this.  The hardscrabble lives of Cather's plains settlers try, as with the dwellers of Ford's Monument Valley, to populate locations more iconic than inhabitable--and all of this is somehow translated into indelible visual and aural poetry.

The pregnant urea and her mother, Dona Maria, follow urea's husband to a remote and undefined plot of--well, sand, to which the husband has some kind of deed.  It is 1910.  There, among the dunes, is a shallow lagoon, constantly changing shape as the wind forms and reforms the sand around it.  They trade with escaped slaves and procure the materials to build a primitive home, which promptly collapses on top of the husband and kills him.  The rest of the movie follows urea, D. Maria, and Maria (urea's daughter) as they alternately try to escape and accept their situation.

If you want plot, go elsewhere.  It isn't that HOUSE OF SAND is all style, but rather that the style and locations manage completely to isolate the ups and downs of a few human lives, to the exclusion of everything else.  In the abstract, these ups and downs will be familiar to anyone alive, but here we are allowed to view them in a manner almost completely removed from context.  There is no messing with time transitions or exposition.  From the outset, we are abruptly made observers of these characters without knowing anything about who they are or how they arrived in the middle of nowhere.  It just so happens that the place where that information emerges organically is at 43 minutes into the movie--it really wouldn't have mattered if we never knew.  Time transitions occur with a single cut, and we are challenged to keep up as we jump from 1910, to 1919, to 1939, and finally to 1970.  To add to the challenge, Fernanda Torres plays both urea and later, her daughter, Maria; Fernanda Montenegro plays, at various times, D. Maria,  urea, and Maria.  The clothes and settings don't change with the times, and I had at least one ""Hey, I thought she was dead"" moment.

And again, the sound.  Natural sounds are meticulously arranged as a composer would arrange a musical score.  There is one moment of choral score, but it is so low down in the mix as to be almost subliminal.  After many years of Dolby 5.1 being available to filmmakers, this is the film to point the way to how it should be used.  My satellite speakers have never had such a workout, and none of the changing directionality of the sounds is gratuitous.

2666833,4,B000J3OTOG,"House of sand (or Casa de Areia) is a broad sweeping movie that feels longer than it's 2 hour run time, but not in a bad way. This is a film that manages to cover 3 generations of women and their lives in a barren Brazilian desert.

In the beginning, a semi-crazed man named Vasco leads a group of servants, along with his wife and her mother, to a remote desert location for unknown reasons. When they are approached by a pack of former slaves, all of Vasco's paid workers grow frightened and leave. Then Vasco dies in an accident. This leaves Aurea and her mother Maria abandoned and alone in a desolate location.

This is combined with the fact that Aurea is pregnant and cannot easily travel any great distance. Aurea and Maria stay in the desert and during an unshown time-lapse of around ten years, Aurea's daughter Maria is born, while her mother Maria passes away. Aurea is still searching for a way back to the city that she longs for.

Events transpire, however, that lead her to want to stay. Time lapse again and young Maria has grown up, while Aurea is now an older woman. And now the young Maria longs to be away from this desert home.

The interesting part of the film is that the same two actresses (Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres) are used for the various generations of women. This makes for an interesting visual story, although it can be a bit confusing since the time lapses aren't explicitly explained.

By the end, the theme of the movie is clear, and although the message may not be entirely new, it is presented in a subtle, moving way.

The broad, sweeping shots of the landscape are incredible, and their beauty and simplicity add so much to the movie the cinematographer deserves much commendation. It's a visually stimulating film with great acting and a great story, what else can you ask for in a film?",1177027200,2,1842,4.549848942598187

2666835,2,B000J3OTOG,"With a pacing that only Tsai Ming-liang could love and deliberate scenery shots that you are forced to enjoy ""House of Sand"" steps into the genre best described as the Foreign Doldrums. Moving as fast as thick molasses never wins any points in my book and considering that that seems to be the main goal of this film we didn't get along too well. The entirety of the movie takes place in the Brazilian desert, a place that we movie fans rarely get to see. However, as you may have guessed, not a lot happens out there. There isn't even a weeping camel out there to keep us company. We watch as a crazy old guy moves his family out into the middle of nowhere (no explanation given) and then dies, stranding everybody else there for three generations. I know, how can I criticize a plot for not having any developments (other than the startling revelation that somewhere out yonder sells salt!) when in reality nothing would ever happen to these characters. And to that I would say that this was not the best yarn to commit to film.

Pretty much everything goes as would be expected. People walk around bored, some of them die off, there are some minor romances, and everything looks beautiful. About ten years in a group of soldiers shows up and Aurea, the crazy man's wife, desperate for anything that moves, strikes up a love affair with one of them. He promises to take her out of the desert, but unforeseen problems prevent that from happening. Throughout more soldiers will arrive, and the females will always view them as tickets out of town, there to be seduced and exploited. Do I believe that these fellow travelers are the only way these women could escape their destiny? Maybe, maybe not. In the end the point is made that living in the Brazilian desert is just about the same as living on the moon, to which I would have to think that moving your family into the middle of the desert and then croaking might to be too smart.

Another minor complaint I would like to air is the usage of the same actors to play different roles. It would be fine, in a ""Three Times"" kind of way, had they bothered to label the passage of time. Instead I was left playing catch up thinking that somehow the grandma had risen from the grave. There is a fairly graphic sex scene somewhere in the middle that might shock you out of your slumber, but really the only use it has is spicing up this overtly bland stew. You have to be in a certain kind of mood to watch a movie like this, and even then it is nearly impossible for the director to pull off. ""Rain"" and ""Elephant"" leap to mind as masterpieces of this technique. These characters really may have been marooned out in no man's land, but unfortunately for the filmmakers the exit of the theater is just a few short steps away. I wasn't lucky enough to have seen this in theaters, but I would have been mighty interested to see how many people took a walk. Awe-inspiring cinematography does not make a movie. . .and here is my proof. **1/4",1171065600,10,2984,4.43351548269581
