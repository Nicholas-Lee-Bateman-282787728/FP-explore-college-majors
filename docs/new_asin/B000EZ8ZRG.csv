2547025,1,B000EZ8ZRG,Get together with some friends and as many bottles of wine.  That way you can possibly have some enjoyment with this inexplicable and boring movie. *special award* for expressionless characters.  *special award* for interminable shots.,1157241600,8,235,5.685714285714286
2547026,5,B000EZ8ZRG,"I honestly had no clue what to think after first viewing this film.  It begins and ends with graphic sex scenes, and the moral tone is ambiguous at best.  After all, our two main characters are a middle-aged kidnapper and a rich girl who sells herself for kicks.  At times the pacing is tedious, and it's difficult to tell what the characters are feeling because the range of emotions they display is minimal.  Despite all this, I found the whole thing fascinating, and when it was over greatly enjoyed watching it again.

In many ways the film is perplexing.  It shows us a riveting and intense slice of life, but that slice is presented with minimal context.  We know a kidnapping has occurred and the victim has died, but other than that, no details are forthcoming.  We're also never told how the (highly unlikely) relationship between the rich girl and her chauffeur began, but it's obvious that it's complicated, emotional, and passionate.  Thematically, this is a film about keeping secrets, and what those secrets can do to us.  It also has something to say about sin, redemption, and social distinctions.

This isn't a film for the squeamish, or for those who want the story spelled out for them.  But, if you can get past that, it's a film that will draw you in, keep you watching, and keep you thinking long after it's over.",1149984000,28,1335,4.6581196581196584
2547027,5,B000EZ8ZRG,"First of all, the story. A couple kidnap a baby that then dies.
The twist: The man, Marcos is the driver and bodyguard to a general. The general's daughter (Who is gorgeous) spends her evenings working as a prostitute at a high class brothel she calls ""The boutique"". When Marcos reveals the kidnapping to the girl, the conflict arises.
There is some explicit sex, but it is minimal, and should not detract from anyone's enjoyment of this movie.
There are layers of subtlety here.
Marco's wife earns some money selling all kinds of things in the Mexico subway, among them cakes made with (Eeeek) Sugus. He wears a jacket that identifies him as a security guard.
The contrast between his lifestyle and the upper class lifestyle adds social commentary and depth to the movie.
I recommend it without reservations.",1149206400,34,810,4.83453237410072
2547028,5,B000EZ8ZRG,"I loved Japon and was quite curious about this one. I'm glad i got the chance to own it because it's a great follow up to Japon AND a good promise of a brilliant film career for Carlos Reygadas. I am now a true fan of his work!

He is again using non-professional actors for this film and you would think that that formula would somehow fail but it honestly doesn't! It seems to give the films more heart and soul if anything. It's an unconventional way to approach filmmaking but a brilliant way too if it's done well. And this is done well.

Yes, there are some strong sexual scenes that are also quite unconventional in this film. I can't help but think of it as something that comes to being as real as possible. Mr. Reygadas doesn't have time for delusions. He'll give you the real thing!",1147737600,7,793,4.315436241610739
2547029,5,B000EZ8ZRG,"This is a really interesting film. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding it (because of certain scenes) which I'm hoping won't scare people off (somehow I don't think it will) but it really is one of those rare movies that gets you talking on so many different levels.

Carlos Reygadas (the director) has a very unique style, which you cannot help but appreciate. Some of the shots in the film are just amazing! Also, I really thought the lead actress, for someone who had never acted before, did a wonderful job! I still cannot decide on the lead male (who had also never acted professionally before) but honestly his performance did not hurt the film any.

What it's about: Basically a chauffeur and his wife kidnap a baby that dies in their care. The chafer confesses his secret to Ana, the daughter of a rich general, who works as a prostitute on the side, and who he drives to her ""job."" Carlos tries to find redemption through Ana, and ultimately falls in love with her.

It is a very intense film, but absolutely worth seeing, despite the graphic scenes and controversy.",1144627200,21,1087,4.6217616580310885
2547030,5,B000EZ8ZRG,"This is Carlos Reygada's second film, and his camera is ceaselessly searching. It investigates the transient murmuring of marching pilgrims, explores the ephemeral traffic of subway corridors, and paces itself to curiously follow the cadence of early morning flag raising ceremonies. It orbits around and inhabits the environment of Marcos, a protagonist so firmly planted to the earth that his crushing personal conflict is barely perceptable on his flaccid expression. Reygadas is desperate to discover the transcendence inaccessible to Marcos, whose only worldly absolve from his sense of shame is to be enveloped by something pure and beautiful - something that obsesses and corrupts him. It is one of the most impressive aesthetic feats in recent filmmaking: every scene (especially the gas station & soccer game sequences) is emotionally engaging. Ignore cries of ""pornography"" from detractors: there have been plenty of recent films to feature graphic sexual scenes, but Battle in Heaven is a incisive character study, not an empty exercise in exploitation.",1144195200,22,1064,5.533742331288344
2547051,2,B000EZ8ZRG,"In BATALLA EN EL CIELO, we are presented with an unflinchingly gritty glimpse into the lives of three individuals struggling with double lives, sexual and social identity in a world that is alternately cruel and nihilistic.  Marco (Marcos Hernandez) drives Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), the wealthy daughter of an influential family.  They also confide in one another their deepest and most disturbing secrets.  Marco and his wife have kidnapped a young child they are holding for ransom.  Ana moonlights as a prostitute, as an escape from her mundane and pampered existence.  The two of them have also engaged in trysts kept in secret from their families and the rest of the world.  (Which are graphically depicted in the film in a style that can be described as anything but dignified.)

For me, the title of this film, alone, is a great paradox that is left to us audience members to ponder.  Is this reference intended to be biblical or cautionary?  Just what is it that the characters are battling in heaven?  Is it a crisis of consciousness?  Are they questioning their own morality (or lack thereof) in the face of relentless alienation?  Particularly, for me, the character of the (at times) catatonic Marco is at once pathetic, as he blankly gazes into the distance, as well as poignant.  You can hardly call him the ""hero"" of this story.  He is more like the hapless anti-hero.  It wasn't so much that I hated him, but, throughout the course of the movie, it was a rare occasion that I felt any connection with him at all, much less the acts that he commits.  They are presented as incidental episodes (be they sexual or violent acts).  It was very hard for me to form any connection with him or with Ana, nor with any of the other characters in the film.

BATTLE IN HEAVEN has been criticized and earned censorship as well as praise.  This is due to the graphic nature of the sex scenes, as well as what has been perceived as an exploitative look at Mexico City and the nature of its people.  We see scenes of soccer matches juxtaposed with soldiers doing their militaristic marches, as well as people engaging in detached sexual activity (maybe the better word for this is soul-less).
This is not a film I can easily recommend as a good introduction to Mexican cinema because it unfortunately left me cold and without a sense of any really deep emotion at all nor any deeper insight into the culture that is depicted in it.",1217894400,24,2430,4.65962441314554
2547052,1,B000EZ8ZRG,"This is the worst film I've ever seen. Pretentious, stupid, pointless. Full of absurd scenes with no meaning and no relation with the plot (plot, which plot???). Full of overused (supposedly artsy) imagery  trickery.

Worst of all, it pretentiously tries to portrait the ""Mexican reality"" by showing ""shocking images"" and ends up showing only common places. Is mocking Mexican Catholicism, over-the-top patriotism and social inequalities something new or innovative?? Why not show a burro with a sombrero dancing la Cucaracha in a bean field too?? Is that art??

It's a shame that an inept director like Raygada gets the financing, attention and screen time to produce such a full of himself pile of garbage, while truly talented and starving directors in Mexico, the US and everywhere have to work really hard to get minimal attention.",1214956800,4,836,5.177777777777778
2547053,1,B000EZ8ZRG,This film had no idea what it wanted to be. It is disjointed and utterly awful. Even the sex scenes were awful. I bought it and simply tossed into the trash after one viewing.,1208822400,5,175,4.176470588235294
2547054,5,B000EZ8ZRG,"From the open shot to the closing, the movie is shocking, in your face, and never dull.  The sight of two grossly overweight people making love was new to film viewing.  Again shocking and unique but very honest",1205798400,,211,4.526315789473684

2547056,2,B000EZ8ZRG,"This is one of those movies that tries too hard to be artsy and substitues content, with close ups of the lead actors face.  I was bored to tears in about five minutes.  Plus it didn't help that the movie was in spanish without subtitles.  I speak enough spanish to find the nearest bathroom in tiajuana but beyond that it's not easy to follow a plot.",1196640000,,351,4.287878787878788
2547057,5,B000EZ8ZRG,"At first I was going to give this movie one star. It seemed to be just a mashup of obvious thematic studies: Sin and redemption; conflict between old/new in Mexico; class/ethnic/religious conflict, etc., with turgid, ponderous plotting and acting with some sex thrown in to sell a few more DVDs.

But then I kept coming back to unattractive it all was. There's always a certain charm in the vulgar; a comfort in the repetitive; and a fascination with intense lack of beauty. In the end, it's the polar opposite of what we expect movies to be. I think Reygadas gets it right.",1186704000,5,574,4.627450980392157
2547058,1,B000EZ8ZRG,"Extreme close-ups, long stills, brutality and subtle story-telling aren't always the necessary ingredients of an art movie. The ordinary need not be ugly and bizarre. I might be sounding too critical, but I think the director's plot was way out of line. If the cardinal idea was to portray Mexico's society (as some reviewers have written), then this isn't the right way to do it.

Marcos & his wife have kidnapped a child for ransom (not shown) and the child dies (not shown again). Marcos is seemingly (horrible acting by the actor) devastated and is supposed to be full of remorse. But, he snuggles up to his boss's daughter Ana and confides in her. Ana & Marcos get close for a while and she asks Marcos to turn himself in. Marcos (the silly) suddenly finds a redemption path. And just when you think he has been shown the right way, he lands up fatally stabbing Ana and then giving her a bizarre tearful hug. As if this weren't enough, he then walks on his knees to a sacred basilica. The movie ends in heaven with Ana & Marcos in a promiscuous position. He has fatally stabbed a young girl and still has the audacity to say that he loves her.

I pity the star cast as well. They didn't have any avenues to show their talent and landed up showing (just) skin.",1179360000,7,1264,4.443965517241379
2547059,2,B000EZ8ZRG,"Apparently people just aren't much into ""faking it"" anymore, even when it comes to sex in the movies. The Mexican film, ""Battle in Heaven,"" opens with a graphic scene of a young woman performing oral sex on the main character - and we can clearly see that this is not a simulation (it's also not much of a stimulation given the man involved).  I don't know if the various hardcore scenes were actually included in the movie when it played theatrically in the United States in 2006.  But they are certainly in the video, and those easily offended by such activity had best be forewarned.

For me, the sex scenes themselves are not the problem.  It is the movie as a whole that I object to.  For ""Battle in Heaven"" is a pretentious, arty contrivance that seems to be operating under the assumption - quite rightly perhaps, since the movie ended up on quite a large number of ten best lists last year - that it can earn points with the critical intelligentsia if it can just manage to bore its audience into a state of complete catatonia.

It tells the desultory and languid tale of an overweight, middle-aged chauffeur who wanders in a zombie-like daze around Mexico City wracked with guilt over the fact that he and his wife recently kidnapped a child who ended up dying under their care.  During the course of the film, Marcos (Marcos Hernandez) is able to shake himself out of his stupor long enough to have sex with his wife, sex with his boss' daughter and sex with himself while watching a soccer game.  The movie is all about the struggle that is being perpetually waged within the Mexican soul between sex and temptation on the one hand and piety, guilt and the obsessive need for redemption on the other.  And while this theme is certainly a valid one and is actually developed to some extent in the closing scenes of the drama, the movie itself is far too inert, far too easily sidetracked, and far too underdeveloped to capture our interest.",1169942400,65,1950,4.564469914040115

8115911,3,B000EZ8ZRG,"<strong>Batalla en el Cielo</strong> (Carlos Reygadas, 2005)

How the hell does one review a movie like <em>Batalla en el Cielo</em> (<em>Battle in Heaven</em> in English)? It almost seems to sit far enough outside the realms of conventional filmmaking (and by ""conventional"" I am not only referring to Michael Bay but to the accepted standards of avant-garde filmmaking a la Tarr or Weerasethakul here) to both defy any critical approach and to dare critics to try and find a way by crouching on the battlements and yelling obscenities. It's simple: while the movie draws on any number of influences (both its plotlines are pretty well-trod classics), it still manages to do things with those plotlines it's pretty much impossible to figure. And I should say that by ""plotlines"" I'm referring far more to setup than I am to structure; there is much less plot to this film than any synopsis would have you believe.

But still, I am inclined to offer one, if only to provide the same sense of setup Reygadas gives us. The movie centers around Marcos (Marcos Hernndez, who, like all the other principals in the film, had never acted before), a low-level member of the Mexican military whose job seems to be to oversee the raising and lowering of the flag every day at the capitol building in Mexico City. (I'm inferring here, and I apologize for not recognizing the landmarks I should be recognizing.) Marcos is trapped in a loveless marriage to a woman (Bertha Ruiz) who remains unnamed in the film; she runs a stall selling knockoff watches in the subway. The family is close to broke, so the wife hatches a plan: kidnap a baby for ransom. Meanwhile, Marcos, not lacking in the time department, is asked by his superior to play chauffeur to the man's daughter, the seductive, constantly-horny Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz). Marcos becomes obsessed with her almost immediately--not a good mental state to be in when one is in the process of committing a serious crime.

I should probably at least consider warning you that at least some of you (and I'm not talking about the Moral Majority here) are going to think this movie is porn. I've found the line on what people consider ""porn"" to be fluid, so I know this is the case. (In detail: the sex scenes are obviously not simulated [or that's the best CGI I've ever seen], though the usual hard-line porn definition--the money shot--is absent.) In fact, since the movie opens with one of these scenes, it almost seems as if Reygadas wanted to start the movie out by kicking the viewer where it hurts. It does feel kind of gratuitous, but like everything else about this movie, it makes me wonder if I'm the one missing something. That parenthetical about my needing to infer about his job was left in by design; Reygadas keeps me wondering throughout if my own cultural ignorance just has me missing important points he's making. (Marcos' family are darker-skinned than Ana; am I reading something into that, or is Reygadas actually saying it? I have no idea.) Add onto this the fact that <em>Battle in Heaven</em> is never what one could call an enjoyable film, and I'm guessing a lot of viewers will look at that ending and say it isn't satisfying, either (though I am not one of them), and you've got a movie that's proably not going to play well in Skokie. But I'm guessing there's a core audience who are going to latch onto this thing like a puppy on rawhide. The problem is, I can't tell you if you're one of those people; you'll need to watch the thing to find out. ** ",1341532800,2,3520,4.690938511326861
8115912,2,B000EZ8ZRG,"I was interested in viewing the movie because of a newspaper review.  I could not find a place to rent the movie in my area of
Whittier, California so I finally decided to buy the DVD.

For the price I paid I was disappointed with the movie.  I was hoping for more depth in the development of the characters and their relationship in the time prior to the baby kidnapping.

I may need a second viewing to fully appreciate the story line and some empathy for the characters.  Sometimes seeing a movie more than once creates a better appreciation of it.

The good news is after several months of trying to find the movie to rent my quest is no over.",1259625600,,647,4.305785123966942
