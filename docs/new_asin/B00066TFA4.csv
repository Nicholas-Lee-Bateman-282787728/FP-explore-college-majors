2170024,5,B00066TFA4,"I saw the movie at the Queens International Film Festival.  I thought it was excellent - atmospheric, beautifully photographed, well edited, superbly acted across the board, and (this is an added bonus) well scored.  The premise is that one of four brothers, an escaped con (Raymond), has chosen the family house to rendezvous with his accomplice brother Jack (who brings along a couple of party girls for the road) and abscond with some ill-gotten money.  Raymond and Jack happen to arrive on the night that the eldest brother - Sebastian - plans to euthanise their cancer-ridden mother with drugs he has persuaded the youngest brother - Kyle - to supply.  All the acting is wonderful (and it helps that the parts are uniformly wonderful too).  The characters are each dysfunctional in different ways.  The brother who has stayed with the mother to hold it all together (Dihlon McManne) is a weakling; Jack (John Philbrick) is an amoral, sadistic loser; Raymond (Blake Gibbons) is caught between good and evil, a cunning but stupid con man with both a genuine family affection and a sadistic, controlling, larcenous streak.

Kyle, the youngest (Gale Harold) is really the strongest of the four (he has quit alcohol and drugs and holds a job), and the best (he never quite gets away from his best instincts, whatever the provocation).  He's also the most damaged (Raymond comes in second).  Kyle is haunted by the horrific family past, and he take prescription drugs - apparently to deal with some form of schizophrenia.  As the haunted one, he experiences terrible flashbacks brought on by the appearance of Raymond and Jack.  It's a very dark film, but very compelling.  I want to mention that the music by Henry LeRoy Finch and Chris Anderson is very good and atmospheric, and that it is augmented by some original songs by a folksinger/songwriter named Ramsey Midwood, with whom I am not familiar.  I have made a note to myself to look for an album of his, because the songs are terrific (very literate folk songs, a bit like Tom Waits's stuff).

How is top-billed Gale Harold?  Excellent technically, as is everybody - especially Blake Gibbons - but Harold brings to it all the depth and complexity he brings to his other performances (on Queer as Folk and Street Time, and in Particles of Truth).  And though he's a mess, and gets messier, there just isn't any way to keep him from being physically and spiritually beautiful.  That works for the script, because Kyle has a goodness that none of this ghastly family has ever quite been able to kill (and that at least two of his brothers recognize and, in their own ways, cherish).  John Philbrick's Jack is the most unredeemed and unsympathetic, but not the scariest.  That's Blake Gibbons's Raymond, who is alternately threatening, appalling, and strangely sympathetic.  He's interesting at all times, but Gale Harold's character is one of those doomed angels - deeply damaged by past events that Blake Gibbons's Raymond doesn't even seem to remember very well - that resonate and become unforgettable.  And Harold is simply hypnotic in the part.",1100736000,30,3103,4.906130268199234
8039359,4,B00066TFA4,I am a Gale Harold fan and this movie did not disappoint.  It was great to see Gale in another role and I thought he carried the movie really well.  The supplier was terrific as I received this DVD within a week from the US.  I live in Australia.,1362441600,,246,3.979591836734694
8039360,5,B00066TFA4,"This is a very bad quality DVD bootleg copy that the original distributor has been illegally selling. PLEASE only by the DVD version that is from Peace Arch or Kaboom. (The cover design is reddish.) If anyone has purchsed this bootleg and would like the ""official"" version, please contact the producers.",1222300800,,303,4.96078431372549
8039361,5,B00066TFA4,"I thought that this was a great movie, i am surprized it wasn't on the big screen. I like all the actors, but i thought Gale Harold was expectionally good in this movie. I love these types of movies it is like they put a camera in a house and you are watching a real family that is largely to do with great actors who can make people think you are watching real people and not a movie.  A must for people who love movies and Gale Harold fans.",1188777600,,442,3.966292134831461
8039362,4,B00066TFA4,"For me, this is one of the better movies that I have seen Gale Harold in. I own all of his stuff, and this is probably the one dvd that I will watch over and over again. It's just one of those movies that suck you in and leave you in shock by the end. I recommend this movie to any Gale Harold fan.",1154822400,,298,3.671875
8039363,4,B00066TFA4,"I won't lie, I bought this DVD because it featured Gale Harold.  But to say I was definitely surprised, would be an understatement.  Blake Gibbons and Gale Harold MAKE this film.  The more I watch it, the more I get out of it, the more I want to watch it again.  And as for the condition of the DVD itself (the quality), I have no complaints at all.

The overall tone of the movie is . . . creepy . . . sad and creepy, and yet so awkwardly funny in places, I found myself feeling slightly guilty for laughing at the humorous aspects of the film.  I would definitely recommend this film for anyone looking for a thought-provoking, independent film.",1153526400,,647,4.305785123966942
8039364,3,B00066TFA4,"Wake was a very good production, minus the effects of the burned DVD, that involves some very talented actors at some of their best work. Martin Landau's part is very miniscule but the narrating he does sort of brings the piece together, encompassing the whole relationship between the brothers by summarizing how difficult brotherly love is and the pressures we face in our youth and in our adulthood.",1125964800,2,402,4.926470588235294
8039365,3,B00066TFA4,"I had a very simple reason why I bought this DVD, I wanted to complete my Gale Harold collection. That is not a very difficult task, since there are only a handfull of DVD's featuring him. My copy of the DVD wasn't very good, the picture was pale and for some reason it was very small with big black borders all around it. I had to use the zoom function of my TV set to get a good picture. That explains for the 3 stars rating. Other reviews have explained the contents of production quite well, so I have nothing to add. Just that it confirmed my idea about Gale, he is a very good character player. And now the reason that Martin Landau is in the picture. You will not see him in 95% of the DVD, so why is he featured at all? Well, maybe the fact that one of the producers is called Susan Landau Finch may have something to do with that? That's ok with me, this is such a small low budget production that the DVD is burned on a DVD-R, so anything that can help selling it may help. Although using Gale's name to promote it may be more helpfull now then using Martin Landau's name.",1123977600,3,1082,4.1084905660377355
8039366,2,B00066TFA4,"I was rather eager to see Gale Harold in a feature length film. I bought the ""Wake"" DVD as soon as I saw it only to be very disappointed by the quality of the DVD.  The picture quality is lacking and is shaky throughout the entire film...I got a headache trying to watch it.  I really felt that I had not gotten the quality of product for the amount of money I paid.",1112659200,6,366,4.0
8039367,5,B00066TFA4,This movie was so great.  Gale did an outstanding job in this film.  The quality of the dvd was perfect.  I wouldn't have guessed it was burned.  This is a must for all Gale Harold fans!,1105401600,10,186,4.083333333333333
8039368,5,B00066TFA4,"Don't be fooled... Martin Landau is hardly in this film.  What you will see is Gale Harold doing what he does best... performing a range of emotions without a lot of words. Harold and Blake Gibbons make this story of brothers interesting and intense. If you're a Gale fan, oh so sad, but a must have.",1101427200,13,300,4.357142857142857
