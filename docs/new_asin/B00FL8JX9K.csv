8616642,4,B00FL8JX9K,"You do punches and kicks to a motivatingly high energy soundtrack of electronic dance music.  It's a lot of fun and I would recommend this workout.
 The music is excellent and  makes the repetitious movements of 8 to the right, then 8 to the left more fun as you hit your punches and kicks on the beat.  Though there are a few more ""dancey"" movements - shoulder rolls and two steps that are kind of rocking steps - for the most part the movements are limited to front and side jabs, hooks and uppercuts for upper body and front, back, side and roundhouse kicks.

There isn't much instruction, they don't break down the moves or give explanations of what's coming next.  This isn't a hindrance as they are very simple moves and the transitions between them aren't hard, but it is the main reason I'd call it ""Kickboxing-inspired"".  They don't give you any particular form to follow, just instruct you to punch and kick in time to the music, and there aren't many combinations.  So you could be flailing your arms and legs

These are solid cardio workouts though.  I was definitely sweating through them.  Along with the above moves, you do some jumping jacks and jumping squats and shuffles as well as burpees.

There are two DVD's included, with two 30 min workouts on each.  DVD 1 has a kicking workout and a ""POWerful Punches"" workout, DVD 2 has a Total Body and a Cardio workout.  Each 30 minute workout consists of segments of 3-5 minute songs.  There is a ""warmup"" and ""cooldown"", though I would highly recommend some stretching before and after as both are the same high-energy movements as the other routines, just without the weights and don't really work as a warmup or cooldown.  I do like that it's a solid 30 minutes of workout - but it would have been nice to have an actual warmup and cooldown to be included.

The weights themselves are great, though they did unfortunately break the DVD case inside the box.  No damage to the DVD's themselves, but that was a bit disappointing; I got this on $5 clearance at a local store though, so I wasn't upset.",1521590400,,2064,4.547425474254743

8616645,3,B00FL8JX9K,"I really liked the workout, but think only one exercise leader is a good leader and that is the very skinny one with the big smile.  The other leaders just were not that good to me and, as a result, I think the set is overpriced.  I also think the title is incorrect.  This is not really a kickboxing exercise set.  There are all types of moves, but kickboxing is not really the focus.  There is a super skinny lady who is very happy who leads a set of exercises.  There is a medium sized women that leads a set and then there is an older woman with pig tails that lead the set.  There is a lot of jumping and hoping around and that is why I really didn't like the set that much.  I bout it for a kickboxing focus, but it didn't really feel like a kickboxing exercise.  The hand weights and ankle weights are great though.",1396483200,,822,4.0875
