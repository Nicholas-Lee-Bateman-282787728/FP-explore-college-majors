8154367,5,B000K53RVE,In my view this was the best classic surf movie ever made.  It married great music with great surfing.  Watching Pipeline to Santana with Jerry Lopez was perfect.  Too bad it is hard to find this flick.,1459555200,,202,4.405405405405405
8154368,4,B000K53RVE,"I am wondering if a scene where the surfer goes to check out the waves, climbs a coconut tree and when he sees the waves the crescendo chords at the beginning of Neil Young's Cowgirl in the Sand sync perfectly with the breaking wave was omitted?  Other than that great memory of fantastic times.",1410739200,2,295,4.462962962962963
8154369,2,B000K53RVE,"I was total disappointed when I run this film. The Original film has been cut and spliced by an amateur. In the Original the main body and theme of this movie was the perfect collaboration of surfing and music by Santana (The Abraxas Album)
I like a copy of the original! or a refund!

8154370,5,B000K53RVE,"The film marries classic rock with Hawaiian surfing in the late sixties/early seventies.  The segment of the fat surfer on the beach eating a big sandwich and washing it down with soda is hilarious.  It documents a time when surfers did it for the love instead of the money.  The surfing, on single-fins, is rather crude by today's standards, but features solid in-the-tube positioning and hard bottom turns.  Few of today's surfers could match the power off the bottom these surfers, like BK and Hakman, had down pat.",1354147200,,518,4.8522727272727275
