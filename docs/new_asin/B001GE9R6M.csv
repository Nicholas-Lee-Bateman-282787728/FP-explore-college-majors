3610748,5,B001GE9R6M,"This film can be obtained in region 1 by purchasing the extraordinary Elia Kazan Collection here at Amazon for a remarkably reasonable price considering its quantity (15 films) and amazing quality of motion pictures .
The central performance by Fredric March is brilliant . As written and directed , nearly every supporting performance is excellent as well . I am predisposed to enjoy films that are set in and around circuses but this drama broke my heart and made me feel profoundly for the people who must exist under a Communist system . If you are young or idealistic or simply misled and feel that living in a communist country could/would be interesting or ""cool"" , I challenge you to watch this 1953 masterpiece set in 1952 Czechoslovakia . Magnificent human drama that's brutally and painfully true . Then as now .",1493856000,,823,4.802816901408451

Some more than others, but still scratched. I didn't expect to have them in this condition with a brand new set! I will attempt to view each movie to see if they all play - if not the set goes back.

The scratched up discs were even worse than everyone is describing. Some discs have mild scuffing which should not affect playback. That I expected. I did NOT expect discs so scratched they would not play. WOW! Seriously messed up! Such a shame. Even for the bargain price of $30 it is not worth it. If they had packaged the discs correctly it would probably be worth $150. As it stands, I would say stay away or be prepared to have to keep returning it till they send you one that is not damaged or at least just a little bit damaged.",1483920000,,688,4.3

He destroyed lives of friends and colleagues and behaved like a self-righteous douchebag.  Still, he made some of the greatest melodramas of the 50s and 60s.

3610777,5,B001GE9R6M,Kazan is one of the half-dozen greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. This is a CRAZY good deal on most of his films (although the Criterion version of On the Waterfront is a must for all the extras). I like the packaging.,1473638400,,224,4.357142857142857

3610779,5,B001GE9R6M,"Not many movies out there are about the TVA. But this one is, and it's both entertaining and educational. The Tennessee Valley Authority was part of the Depression Era New Deal. It both put unemployed men to work and built a system of dam driven turbines that furnished electricity to much of the South. The trouble is that it required taking over the land affected by the new waterways and moving off the owners. Despite offering compensation to the owners, many didn't want to leave. Here, old lady Garth (Van Fleet) refuses to leave and by golly no one's going to make her, including government man Glover (Clift). How he eases her off the land without using force forms the crux of the plot.

Filming in Tennessee in Technicolor is a real asset, lending both eye appeal and authenticity. I also like the way the movie deals with social issues of the time. Blacks as well as Whites are hired onto the same TVA work teams and paid the same wages. That upsets both local segregation laws and the local economy since Blacks are customarily paid a fraction of what Whites get. Naturally many Blacks leave their former jobs to hire on with the better paying government work force. This angers many local Whites who then try to disrupt the project. Thus, federal man Glover has a lot to contend with, especially since he's also romancing old lady Garth's unhappy granddaughter, Carol (Remick).

Van Fleet's excellent as the hard-bitten matriarch, and so is Salmi as one of the local thugs. Surprisingly, Remick's usual sexy appearance is downplayed in favor of a more emotive role. But to me, the real surprise is Clift. He's mostly expressionless throughout the 100-minutes. I suspect that's because of the auto accident that so damaged his face several years earlier. But, whatever the reason, he's not nearly as effective as we know he could be from earlier films.

This may not be one of director Kazan's more celebrated showcases, but it is both an intriguing drama and a revealing look at an important slice of American history.",1472256000,,2031,4.780626780626781
3610780,5,B001GE9R6M,"Don't understand what all the fuss is about regarding the packaging of this fantastic set of Elia Kazan movies.  I cannot fault  the set I received: all 18 discs placed securely and undamaged in the allotted pockets of this tasteful book type presentation.
Aside from the packaging, it is the quality of the films that are paramount here and for any serious film buff or lover of great movies, this collection is a must have.
Many may already have some of these films in their library (especially the classics: ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", ""East of Eden"", ""On the Waterfront"", ""America America"") which have been released many times previously. The beauty here is, the other 11 films and the Martin Scorsese documentary ""A Letter to Elia"" which have been included to this very handsome and economical package of 16 films. Priceless Kazan works including less famous titles such as his debut film ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"", the Oscar winner ""Gentleman's Agreement"", generally underrated gems ""Panic in the Streets"", ""Viva Zapata!"", ""Baby Doll"" and ""Wild River"" to the rarely seen ""Boomerang!"", ""Man on a Tightrope"" and ""A Face in the Crowd"".  Not a bad film here (6 get the **** Leonard Maltin rating), and whatever we may think of Kazan's dubious actions during the blacklist, one cannot deny the power and quality of his films and his standing as one of the greatest of American film directors.
An extra bonus (apart from all the extras on the discs, especially the double discs of ""Streetcar"" and ""Eden"") is the beautiful hard cover book that is included in the boxed set stored in a sturdy slipcase.  Full of stills, on set photographs featuring Kazan in action and insightful notes on each film which superbly compliments this collection.",1472083200,,1741,4.91156462585034

3610784,5,B001GE9R6M,"I have been looking at this collection on amazon for quite sometime.  Even though the price for this collection is great I was very reluctant to order it due to so many negative reviews on here regarding the packaging.  After several months amazon offered it for $20.99 so I decided to tempt fate and order it.  I figured if not happy with it then I would just return it.  I just received it in the mail today and I nervously opened it to find 15 gems of movies inside!  All are in pristine condition!  Yes it's true that a couple fit a little snug in their holders but if you simply raise the lid right above the title of each movie with your finger and put another finger in the hole of the disc it slides right out.  My only suggestion is that maybe some soft felt could have been used on the side of the movie for safer keeping and more protection for them when removing or putting them back in.  But with  little card during each process I think they will be fine.  I am very happy with this purchase, the box, book, and movie holder case are beautiful!  No way will I return it or ever get rid of this collection!  Last thing I can say based on other reviews is either I just got lucky with this item or perhaps you can't believe everything you read on here as far as reviews go?  I say take a chance and order this collection if you love movies, especially Elia Kazan movies.  I'm glad I did!",1470441600,,1399,4.1716417910447765

3610787,5,B001GE9R6M,"This is a beautiful set of Kazan movies.  The packaging is actually quite nice looking.  I checked the individual discs as soon as I got the delivery because so many reviewers mentioned scratches and specks on the discs.  I found one disc with a couple of specks (Gentleman's Agreement) but all the others were good.  I was able to remove one of the specks easily but the other one was somewhat difficult to clean.  I did my best to remove it without scratching the surface.  It seemed to work and I am able to watch the movie.  It's always nicer when a purchase comes in 100% perfect condition; but considering how cheaply ($25) this set is priced, I am happy with it, especially since I hadn't seen Viva Zapata and Man on a Tightrope before.",1466380800,,743,4.45925925925926

I took a gamble on buying this collection and got some great films at a great price in very poor condition.

The packaging is absolutely beautiful. The hardcover ""booklet"" is large and very well-done, and the discs are easy to remove from their slots.

3610791,4,B001GE9R6M,"Bad packaging problem can be solved, but only if you're willing to rip or cut the cardboard around the bottom half of the DVD BEFORE attempting to remove them.

But I absolutely love the movies in this collection, so for $24 and free shipping I decided to take the risk, figuring I could just return it if it was in as bad a shape as some of the reviews suggest.  I'm pleased to say that mine arrived in perfect condition.  It arrived in a proper-sized box with bubble wrap and the set itself was still in the original wrapping.  I checked every disc inside the package and they are all in new condition with absolutely no damage.  I did remove the discs, however, and placed them in proper cases because I don't like having to pull them out of the sleeves by the outside edges of the discs and getting fingerprints on them.  It's a shame because the overall presentation of the packing is super pleasing to the eye and to the coffee table.

No matter one's opinion of Kazan's politics, he was a great (great) director and all these movies at this price (< $30) is a no-brainer.

3610804,2,B001GE9R6M,"This curated collection of Kazan films is beautifully conceived and manufactured -- except for the DVDs themselves. The packaging is exceptionally handsome, the book is more than fluff, and quite a few extras for the movies are included -- extras not mentioned in Amazon's general description. If I could find a way to _play_ the discs I would list those unmentioned extras. But unfortunately after several hours of effort I cannot.

Like other customers I found sticky bits, fingerprints, and scratches on the playing surfaces of the DVDs. Of course, no new product ""should"" come with sticky bits and scratches, but at the same time no set like this ""should"" retail for a Jackson plus change. So, I thought, if some modest effort on my part could resolve issues with sticky bits and scratches, it would be well worth the money, a 90% savings off list.

Unfortunately, the particular set I received not only had scratches, fingerprints, and gummy bits but also deep scar-like scratches and triangular gouges. These, in my opinion, could not possibly be due to the die-cut cardboard pages: other collections with die-cut cardboard pages -- for example, a Werner Herzog collection and a Mike Leigh collection -- have no issues at all with scratching.

In my experience a light mist of Maxell Disc & Electronic Cleaner usually resolves issues with typical DVD scratches. With that in mind I tried a liberal application of the cleaner to the back of a few discs. This did indeed resolve all issues with sticky bits and normal scratches. But issues with deep scratches and gouges remained. After half an hour or so of on-and-off cleaning and testing efforts per disc some films still froze during three or more of their chapters. In the set I received, as in one described by another reviewer, the discs most damaged were the ones hardest to find outside this collection.

So I'm reluctantly returning it. I may order it again to see if my luck improves. These are, after all, films with tremendous heart, and some reviewers sound like the copies they got would play.",1448928000,,2062,4.866096866096866

my 2nd set to return to Amazon, I have to conclude this set is simply never going to be problem free enough to be a
reasonable buying choice.

The two sets I got (original and replacement) both had all the problems described here earlier; glue on several disc playing
surfaces, rendering them unplayable, nasty scratches and scuffs on more of the discs than not.

And yes, I removed them very carefully so as to make sure I wasn't causing them.  Also, they were just as often in the areas
near the 'top"" of the disk that should be making no contact at all if you remove them carefully).

Also, both sets I got had some bad glue stains on the back cover where the rear cover 'page' (with the bar code and
other info) had been glued with huge globs of glue that created clear lumps and dark areas, along with (on one set)
glue spilling out from underneath and damaging the rest of the box.

One interesting note - all the scratches on the two sets I tried were in new Fox discs made for the set.  The discs brought
over from releases already out there (Streetcar, East of Eden, etc) showed no scratches (although they were just as likely
to have glue on their playing surface).  I don't know if that means Fox was using inferior DVD media or simply that the
scratches were happening somewhere else in the process than during packing the box, and 2 sets are hardly a
scientific sampling, but it was notable.

It's really too bad.  It's a brilliant set in terms of content, but if the discs come damaged it really doesn't matter.

I did call Fox customer service, who were very friendly, but claimed they hadn't heard of any problems with the set. (?!?)
They offered to replace my set with a new, wrapped set from the warehouse, but couldn't simply replace the scratched and
glued discs with new ones.  The fellow I was talking to admitted that I'd simply be rolling the dice to see if I got lucky this time.

I don't feel a $160 set should ever be a 'hope you get lucky' situation.",1351900800,,2098,4.376288659793815

The transfer is 16x9 Widescreen, but seems slightly cropped on both sides.  The print and sound are virtually perfect.  The only rub is this, you CANNOT watch the movie without subtitles!  There are English subtitles, and are great for the hearing impaired, but otherwise are redundant when watching the movie in English.  Also, there is no 5.1 option when listening to the original English soundtrack, only 2.0 mono.  There IS a 5.1 option for the movie dubbed into Spanish.  This was noted by the Amazon reviewer, but I missed it.  For the price (I payed $6.99 plus postage) and the great transfer it really is a bargain.

If you never remove the discs, it is great. However. the discs come inserted in pages backed with stiff cardboard (think pages of books for very young children). Unless one is extremely carefully (and accepts that the paper that actually holds the disc in its place may tear) it is virtually impossible to remove them without getting them scuffed on the sharp edges of the die-cut cardboard.

My suggestion, should you choose to purchase this collection (which does contain films otherwise unavailable on region one discs), is first remove the discs very carefully from the original packaging by pulling the paper away from the disc so that it can be lifted out without dragging on the cardboard. Then I would recommend repackaging them in standard DVD cases (14mm cases that hold up to six discs are available online). Otherwise, I can't imagine how scratched these disc could become after repeatedly being removed and replaced. This would also have the added benefit of making it a little easier to store the collection on a shelf.

Instead of providing individual DVD cases for the DVDs, the discs are packed into a booklet.  However the glue that has been used to keep the booklet's pages together have gotten on to the discs rendering them defective.  In the first set that I received of this collection, more than a half dozen of the discs had multiple globs of the glue on them and could not be played.  Additionally almost all of the discs in the collection had scratches, scuff marks and some even had finger prints on them.  Apparently 20th Century Fox has no quality control or regard for the consumer otherwise the disgraceful packaging of this set wouldnt have occured.

3610851,5,B001GE9R6M,"The Elia Kazan collection is a lovingly put together package for serious film buffs. It's clear that Kazan has had a profound effect on the career of Martin Scorsese and other directors. There are rare films here, difficult to get on DVD, like PINKY, MAN ON A TIGHTROPE, and VIVA ZAPATA. Kazan brought realism, human emotion, psychological depth, and intensity of performance to the screen. His contribution to the art of film ranks up there with all the great directors. Not only was he deserving of the ""special Oscar"" in 1999, but also of an AFI Life Achievement Award and much more. Unfortunately, as is often the case in Hollywood, awards get mixed up with politics. If one is not of the ""correct political stripe"" they are excommunicated -- like Kazan was for his testimony in 1952 before HUAC. Testimony whose greatest harm was to Kazan himself. But it wasn't his testimony alone that caused many in Hollywood to protest his 1999 Oscar, it was the fact that he never apologized for it. As his attorney, Floria V. Lasky said, ""Apologize? Recant? That's a good Stalinist word."" She instead called on them to apologize for supporting brutish Stalinist Russia.
Hurrah for Martin Scorsese and 20th Century Fox for releasing this fine collection of Kazan's masterful works.

3610855,4,B001GE9R6M,"This is a very good box set. I've been waiting a while for A tree grows in Brooklyn , Viva Zapata and Wild River. The thing is, I already owned some of these wonderful films like the Brando movies, Baby Doll and East of Eden but lucky me I didn't bought the other ones already out like Panic in the streets or Boomerang for example. So I would advise to buy this if you don't have everything already out or if you're a big fan of Kazan's work because this is a collector's item I think. First of all, the packaging is very interesting starting with a 100 pages hard cover book taking every movies on this box set individually and talking about them (a brief presentation of the film, some facts and interesting photos of the production) the way the DVD's are presented is also original, they're in a hard cover packaging (like a photo album) and every DVD is in a pocket with a brief description of the movie and the year it was made. The only thing I didn't like was that most of the films that were out before (East of Eden, On the waterfront) they took the DVD's of the old release so it looks kind of strange in the packaging. Let's talk about the new transfers (A tree grows in Brooklyn, Viva Zapata, Man on a tightrope and Wild River), they are spectacular! clear, no scratches or dirt and great contrast (in the b/w movies). Also the new documentary A letter to Elia is amazing. You can feel all the love and the admiration that Martin Scorsese has for Mr. Kazan and it's easy to understand why he made such an effort on this box set to honour and to respect his mentor. I give 4 stars instead of 5 because the box is not complete, where are the later movies like The Arrangement and The last Tycoon, I'm sorry but Kazan's career didn't stop after America, America. Also, extras are missing, I like the fact that almost every film as an audio commentary but half the movies have no extras.

In the set I received, EVERY one of the 18 discs had scuffs, scratches and what appeared to be flecks of adhesive on the playing surface.  The DVD of PINKY in particular looked liked it had been scraped against a rough piece of metal.  I can only assume this was the result of careless handling somewhere in the production process.  My advice to anyone thinking of purchasing this pricey set is: if you really want to add the rarer films like VIVA ZAPATA! and WILD RIVER to your collection right now, you might take a chance and get it.

3610857,4,B001GE9R6M,"The Elia Kazan Collection is a long overdue tribute to one of America's greatest and most influential directors. Amazon's price is very appealing compared to the $199 price I found at the retailers. The collection's big draw is the five films not available separately on DVD: A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, Viva Zapata, Man on a Tightrope, Wild River, and America, America. The problem is that potential buyers are strictly Kazan fans and already own the other ten films on DVD.  To buy or not to buy? To obtain those five films on DVD I personally didn't have to think twice.

Some criticisms: Scorcese's tribute documentaries are entertaining but everyone will cringe at the comments of Al Pacino. He never worked with Kazan and his remarks are composed of one empty cliche after another. The packaging is attractive but all of the DVD's should have been labeled in the collection format. The ten films that are currently available separately on DVD were released with the same content. Baby Doll, A Face in the Crowd, and Splendor in the Grass do not include commentary. Of the five films in this collection not available separately on DVD, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Wild River, and America, America include commentary, Viva Zapata and Man on a Tightrope do not. Commentary should have been provided for EVERY film in this collection. Kazan fans will also be disappointed by the sparse information included in the booklet. I also agree with several of the other reviewers who objected to the unprotected DVD's being stored in cutouts in the cardboard pages. It's an atrocious packaging design flaw. Fortunately for me, none of the discs in my set were damaged although it was extremely difficult to remove a few.

With this collection, there are now only two of Kazan's film's not available on DVD: Sea of Grass and The Visitors. I doubt we'll ever see those two. The two Kazan films available on DVD but not included in this collection are The Arrangement and The Last Tycoon.

Why doesn't Amazon open the box up and photograph what's inside? That's a pretty high price and consumers have a right to see what's in there.,1289088000,,380,4.521739130434782
3610860,5,B001GE9R6M,"I think this is great for collectors who don't have many of the films but many of us have many in this collection.
TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN is absolutely wonderful and deserves to be issued separately.  I can imagine how many high
schools alone would buy it.  They could do it in their CliffsNotes series like they did with JANE EYRE and ANNA
KARENINA.  I am greatful to TCM for showing TREE often and they have a terrific print.  Another great film, SUNRISE,
was never issued separately but at least it was in its own case and many copies turn up on e-bay.  For me, the greatest child performance is still Peggy Ann Garner's in this film and there are terrific performances by Dorothy McGuire, Joan Blondell and James Dunn.  Please, 20th Fox, put this out as a separate entity.",1288915200,,776,4.507142857142857
3610861,5,B001GE9R6M,"I was lucky to attend a sold out screening of the doc in this collection A LETTER TO ELIA in New Orleans at the very cool Prytania Theater where they also screened PANIC IN THE STREETS, I was blown away. As a result, I have been obsessed with the older lesser known Kazan films like PINKY and BOOMERANG! which are available on DVD. Knowing that this collection includes a few never-before-released Kazan films such as AMERICA, AMERICA (dying to see this and wish I had been at the New York Film Festival where it screened and it's featured prominently in A LETTER TO ELIA), A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN and  WILD RIVER it makes the collection worth it for just those films.",1288742400,,669,4.483606557377049
3610862,5,B001GE9R6M,"While this is a package that is one of the most exciting yet produced, I am more than a little disheatened because I already have in my possession good copies of some of them.  I had  hoped that the set, which I had heard rumored for some time, would consist of the missing Kazan works... particularly the magnificent America, America, along with Viva Zapata, Wild River, and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  It is a pain that they aren't going to be  sold separately (at least, for now, as they 'say'). I know I will not be able to avoid ordering the set, because I have eagerly awaited the 'missing' Kazan's.  But, geez, give a movie fan a break once in a while!!",1287446400,,659,4.32520325203252
3610863,5,B001GE9R6M,"""WILD RIVER"" has been one of my top ten favorites (including classics and modern movies) since I first saw it about 20 years ago.  I have been looking for it on dvd for over ten years only to irritatingly find it on ""Region 2 DVD"" ONLY.  This movie is motivated with ""politics vs.humanity/rights of the people"" (in two ways), re: generations of family land ownership and also racially by offering African Americans jobs that are created by the political actions this movie circles around.  The ""sidebar"" romance story in this movie attempts to balance the emotional complexity created.  All in all, a 10 (not 5) star movie that needs to be released on ""Region 1 DVD"".  This movie WILL be released in the ""Elia Kazan Collection"" with several others on November 9, 2010 for 149.99.",1286928000,,779,4.7407407407407405
3610864,4,B001GE9R6M,"America, America is finally coming out on DVD. To me this movie is worth the price of the entire set. They show it on AMC about once a year at about five in the morning so it is almost impossible to catch, it is just a great and very underrated movie. It is the story of an ethnic greek trying to emigrate from Turkey to the USA about the turn of the last century and is based on Kazan's own uncle.",1286841600,,398,3.925925925925926
3610865,4,B001GE9R6M,"This collection is long overdue, in collecting the major film works of one of the most important American artists of the 20th century.  Very, very glad to see Wild River and America, America appearing on DVD.  I wished they had added his little-seen 1972 film The Visitors that was made on a shoestring with a just a handful of people, and featured the screen debut of James Woods.  It turned out much better than his previous studio film, The Arrangement which starred Kirk Douglas and was based on Kazan's own best-selling novel.  Kazan was fined by the Directors Guild for using a non-union crew on The Visitors, but he later said the do-it-yourself ethos of small-scale filmmaking was stimulating, and his direction of the script by his son Chris contained not just the expected great performances, but also some visual poetry as well.

It's a shame Marlon Brando wasn't at Kazan's side when he picked up that last Oscar.  He could never repay what he owed Kazan, and he could have shown the world that by being there and standing with him.",1286150400,,1044,4.708791208791209
3610866,4,B001GE9R6M,"From the press release:

""The 18-disc set will feature 15 films with 5 new-to-DVD (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Viva Zapata!, Man on a Tightrope, Wild River, and America, America.) The other 10 make up films already released by Fox, Warner and Sony.

The collection will also include a collector's booklet and the documentary, A Letter to Elia.

The studio confirms that at this time singles will not be available. So anyone wishing to purchase the previously unreleased titles may only do so through this set.""

I have most of what is already previously released - as I assume many classic film fans do. It's a shame they won't sell 1945's  ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" separately, as that film alone would likely make big sales. It's been tops on a list of most wanted classic flims for a long time. As for the documentary, it's airing on PBS in October.

Finally there is the issue of packaging. If Fox was going in on this alone I'd look back at the horror that was the packaging of The Alfred Hitchcock Premiere Collection, The Paul Newman Tribute Collection, and the Murnau-Borzage at Fox Collection and just assume that this set too would come with the DVDs looking like they were packed by Catwoman with her claws extended since apparently Fox is too busy reselling the Alien(s) series of movies in every conceivable format to be bothered with classic film fans anymore.  However, there is hope in that regard with Sony and Warner's involved.",1284768000,,1445,4.7103174603174605
3610867,5,B001GE9R6M,"Oh, wow! I can't wait for this! It collects, in one place, most of the filmography of Elia Kazan, including the DVD debut of the long-out-of-circulation ""Viva Zapata!"". It also contains all of his essential films, such as ""Streetcar"", ""Waterfront"", ""Eden"", etc. . I only wish it also contained his last feature, ""The Last Tycoon"".

 And, as a true bonus, you get a brand new Martin Scorsese directed picture, ""A Letter to Elia""!!!

 An absolute must for any film buff.",1284681600,,468,4.8125
3610868,5,B001GE9R6M,"It is a shame this film has fallen into obscurity over the years. Though overshadowed by Elia Kazan's more heralded and flashier efforts, I have always found ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" and ""Wild River"" to be his best. Thanks to a scarred Montgomery Clift and a young and earthy Lee Remick, ""Wild River"" has a feeling of quiet reality.

Monty's genius was to be so much the person he was portraying that he seemed to disappear onscreen. Clift's sensitive performance here, coming after the accident which altered his appearance, is one of his best. It is matched by lovely Lee Remick.

Clift works for the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) and has come to Jo Van Fleet's rural home to move her off her land so room can be made for a dam. Clift is not uncaring and his sympathy for the older woman is complicated even further by his attraction to her young granddaughter, Lee Remick.

He is also unpopular because of his fair treatment of blacks whom he is employing to help build the dam. But the violence simmering just beneath the surface here is less on his mind than Remick. He cannot have her because of what he is forced to do. Yet it is torture for him.

Clift's sensitivity and Remick's heart, torn between what she knows he has to do and what she feels within for him creates a frustration for the would-be couple the viewer can really feel. One scene in particular, as Remick paces back and forth in front of a sitting Clift, reveals the ache in Clift which finally blows.

Beautiful location filming by Kazan adds a further sense of reality to this quiet yet moving film. This was one of Clift's best post-accident performances and it is sad it is only available in this region 2 format for those across the pond to enjoy. Perhaps soon it will be recognized for the quiet masterpiece it is and become available to all.",1279843200,,1827,4.524242424242424

8305116,5,B001GE9R6M,"This is a movie made in 1953 about a circus in Communist-occupied Czechoslovakia right after World War II.  It could not possibly be more compelling or convincing on the tyrannical, dehumanizing effects of a Communist government.  But, it is the character and passions of the people involved which actually drives the movie, leaving the viewer on the edge of his seat.

The oppression, coercion and arbitrary authority of the Communist government finally breaks through the determination of the circus leader to stay out of politics, and impels him into a dramatic action against the state.  As he loses his submission to the Communist overlords, he noticeably gains in his strength and character as a human being, a change which carries a great reward and a great price.

I don't understand why this movie is not routinely on the list of ""best 100""  or even ""best 25"" movies of all time.",1506988800,,888,4.886666666666667

8305118,5,B001GE9R6M,"Great value here.  It's especially interesting to watch Kazan's early studio work like ""Pinky"" and ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.""  Beautifully constructed stories and really good acting.  These were not Kazan's personal favorites.  He liked later location-shot pictures like ""On the Waterfront"" and ""A Face in the Crowd,"" which are also included.  I agree that stylistically these later pictures show great directorial mastery.  But Kazan's root gift was as a theatre director and a master at working with actors.  Despite its obvious defects, ""Pinky"" has fantastic performances by Ethel Waters, Ethel Barrymore and Fred O'Neill.  Enjoy ""Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""Viva Zapata,"" but don't miss the lesser known ""Wild River"" and ""Panic in the Streets,"" especially if, like me, you hadn't seen them before.",1503360000,,803,5.419354838709677
