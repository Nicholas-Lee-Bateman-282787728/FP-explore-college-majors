2620350,4,B000GW8TO6,"This documentary, covering Dylan's start in music to his conversion to Christianity, brings two DVDs together into one package: Tales from a Golden Age: Bob Dylan 1941-1966 and After the Crash: Bob Dylan 1966-1978.

Interviews with Dylan, more footage of him performing and the use of Dylan's own music are the only things that could have made this collection better.  But since this is an unauthorized documentary, we only get a few seconds of Dylan performing at the Isle of Wight and with Johnny Cash on the second DVD.  The background music sounds like Dylan but is not performed by him.

Aside from these minor drawbacks, Dylan's life and career are fleshed-out by a variety of music critics, friends and fellow musicians.  Hailing from the U.K. and U.S. they provide much more than dry analysis.  We get warm reminiscing from people who appreciate Dylan's work.  In addition to showing how vital he was in shaping modern music, we see his humanity and the influences that molded him.  The critics expertly dissect his every album.

What intrigues me is how much they see.  Their work is utterly fascinating.  Like prophets they amplify the message of the songs.  This is especially helpful when dealing with a person as mysterious as Bob Dylan, who can keep everyone guessing.

The narration, editing and video of this British production are excellent. You don't have to be a fan to appreciate the production quality and the insightful analysis.  Why Dylan would not contribute and authorize these documentaries is a mystery.  He's not portrayed in a negative light, and this serves as a tribute to a productive career that continues to this day.

This leaves you wanting to know the rest of the story.  Let's hope for more installments.

2620351,5,B000GW8TO6,"This two DVD set produced in 2004 - and just now being made available in the US - packs two different documentaries - one on Dylan's early years in Minnesota and moving to NYC through the ""going electric at Newport"" period; the other from 1968 through 1978 period (at which time he found God - into one ""boxed set). The packaging is deceivingly simple as this loks like another of those ""unauthorized biographies"" out there on DVD. But this is a real class act!

The producers sought out some of the major players in Dylan's career - like bassist Rob Stoner, folk musician Martin Carthy, and the owners of the major Greenwich Village folk clubs and did extensive interviews. Then there are the Dylan ""experts"": British music writers and biographers who, not only know the details, but can speak with passion and enthusiasm. (and then there are the ""footnotes"" to Dylan's career like AJ Weberman, who collected Dylan's trash (really) and comes across as quite weird in the recent interviews.

I'm only a fringe Dylan fan but he's part of our musical heritage so the more I know the better. I learned a lot as this 3-1/2 story unfolded in chronological order and I know I'll be seeking out some of the lesser-known Dylan albums based on what I learned. There are no ""official"" Dylan recordings on either disc (though there are brief clips from ""The Last Waltz""). The soundtrack is by a Dylan cover band. And there's little archival footage. It's mostly the interviews. But the interviewees are SO interesting, and the editing so well done, that I never felt I was watching just ""talking heads"".

So if you are a true Dylan fan, you'll find this set fascinating. If, like me, you know just the big ""hits"" (or his forays into film - which are also discussed) then you'll learn a lot from this release.

8134913,4,B000GW8TO6,"As has been noted, this package contains the first and second Dylan documentaries in the series produced by UK-based Chrome Dreams, which I generally recommend highly. Elsewhere I have reviewed the individual entries.

The first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-From-a-Golden-Age-Bob-Dylan-1941-1966/dp/B0002VET54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales From a Golden Age - Bob Dylan - 1941-1966</a>, is rather unnecessary, except as an introduction to the series. The second film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Dylan-1966-1978-After-the-Crash/dp/B000AQQHRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Dylan: 1966-1978 - After the Crash</a>,however, is much more insightful, and as a package, the two make more sense together. Both of these were filmed at the same time and appear to have been filmed on standard definition video. I mention that because the later films in the series are of higher quality.

Although released in 2004, it was obviously filmed at least somewhat earlier. The film appears to be standard definition video. Unlike the others in the series, the first two films suffer from lack of access to Dylan's music. The first film is interlaced with music that evokes Dylan, but which is a poor substitute. The second film, however, provides several alternative live, televised, performances, which themselves are fascinating. The producers seemed to have had no access to the album cuts of the songs.

Both feature extensive involvement by Clinton Heylin. Mr. Heylin is, himself, a very controversial figure among Dylan critics. That said, I appreciate Mr. Heylin's own critical contributions, generally, and find his lack of slavish worship of Dylan refreshing.

It is important to understand that these documentaries attempt to cover the process of the making of Dylan's music, the critical response to it at the time of its release, and a reassessment of it with the passage of time. In that respect, I would have to say that the first film fails, but the second succeeds for the most part. This is probably because the first film covers a period that is well documented in print and on film and really offers nothing to anyone but the most casual of Dylan fans. On the other hand, the second film covers a much less documented period, and as such, can be said to offer insights that most fans may not otherwise have access to.

One final point, the films, for the most part touch on Dylan's biography only to the extent that the biography touches on the songs themselves. If that is what you are looking for, then you will be generally pleased with these films, taken together. If you are looking for something else, however, then you should look elsewhere.",1318464000,4,2763,5.58472553699284

8134916,5,B000GW8TO6,"I love this DVD because I am a MAJOR Dylan fan..I think it will appeal
to others such as myself. It does not contain much music but has interviews with those people who have worked with him, written about him, etc. for the bulk of his working life. I found the interviews very, very
interesting and something I will go back and listen to over and over again. For those who are not interested in stuff about Dylan, and just
want music, this would not be recommended.",1199577600,,465,4.35632183908046

All this is is two previously released DVDs: Tales from a Golden Age: Bob Dylan 1941-1966 and After the Crash: Bob Dylan 1966-1978 placed in a new cardboard box. Nothing new. Nothing added except the printing on the box.

If you don't have these other DVDs, you can buy this set and save a few bucks. If you do have the others, save your money.",1187827200,2,409,4.311688311688312
8134918,1,B000GW8TO6,"This is really a disappointment. There are much better Biographies out there. The Martin Scorcese one and the other about the Rolling Thunder and the Evangelical phases are much better. This one relies on interviews with a few critics who go though the album releases one by and give a commentary about their strengths and weaknesses. Blah. The most interesting part was seeing Weberman in person; he almost looks and sounds normal. Oh yes, and hearing from one of the fellas who worked on Blood on the Tracks; that was nice.
