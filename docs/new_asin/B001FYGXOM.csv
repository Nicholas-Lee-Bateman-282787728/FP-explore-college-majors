It is edited very nicely and a good intro for folks that are new to the case; however, I'm not very happy with Horn's decision to try to horde all this valuable information.  He should put this film on google video and you-tube for free.  I'll guarantee that if he does that, he would see an increase in sales.

The most interesting Ufo cases out there are that of Jim Sparks (he needs to support a film/documentary on his case), Dr. Jonathan Reed (the Mexican news story was okay, but there needs to be a follow up), and Philip Schneider (murdered by government/corporate spooks) no one has dared to do a story on this man, a documentary on his case would shock people!

I am pleased with the silent revolution of truth because it covers human spirituality as well as philosophy on life and the meiers material (photos and such).",1291334400,2,880,4.515723270440252
8303119,5,B001FYGXOM,"I have looked at the Billy Meier material for over 20 years.  This Documentary is very good, but for those whom have not been exposed to some truth along the way in their lives, this could have a deep emotional effect on them.  For those who are truth seekers, the contents presented in this DVD is for you.  What you do with it in this life time is the next step.  Good luck.",1290297600,2,376,4.109589041095891
