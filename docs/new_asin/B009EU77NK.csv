5323081,5,B009EU77NK,Great friend movie ! This is totally made for my generation with the wity/dark humor. Its a great story of how some people just become unlikely duos.,1354320000,,149,4.555555555555555
5323082,5,B009EU77NK,"I could not stop laughing.  This movie was hilarious.  Yes, the plot is somewhat predictable, but the one liners and random cameos (Seth Rogan!) are unexpectedly wonderful.  I'm surprised this movie never made it bigger in the theaters.  I highly recommend it.  The trailer does not do it justice.",1354147200,,297,4.979591836734694

5323088,4,B009EU77NK,"""For a Good Time, Call..."" (2012 release; 85 min.) brings the story of two girls down on their luck. Katie (played by Ari Graynor) lives in a fabulous apartment in New York which she no longer can afford. Lauren (played by Lauren Miller) has just been told by her boyfriend that he wants to ""evaluate"" their relationship and she needs to move out. A mutual friend, Jesse (played by Justin Long), brings the girls together and even though they have an unpleasant history together from their college days, they really have no choice but to try to make things work. And how they do! Lauren finds out that Katie, in order to make some extra money, works on the side as a phone sex operator. Lauren figures out that if they do this on their own, they'll make much more money.

While a heavy emphasis is made in the promotional materials for the movie (both on the poster and in the trailer) about the sex phone operation, the movie is in fact much more about how two girls who used to hate each other become unlikely best friends 10 years later. In that sense, the movie is the female version of a ""brocom"".

Lauren Miller, in addition to starring, also co-wrote and co-produced the movie. She is the wife of Seth Rogen, who appears in a short but hilarious cameo. I had first noticed Miller in last year's ""50/50"" movie, and with this she simply confirms that she is a rising star in the Hollywood indie scene. Kudos as well for Ari Graynor, who shines as Lauren's room mate and comes across like a Bette Midler reincarnated. But a special shout-out to Justin Long, who is just fantastic as Jesse. I also want to point out that the soundtrack plays a big role in the movie, and features plenty of indie talent such as Unknown Mortal Orchestra, the Generationals, High Highs, and Los Campesinos!, just to name those. With its light-hearted touch, it is just the perfect Fall movie when everyone's grown tired of the summer blockbuster big budget action hero movies and never-ending explosions.",1351555200,18,1988,4.597183098591549

5323124,4,B009EU77NK,"Love this movie and was quick to pick up the unrated blu ray combo pack when I saw it. The case says it included both the rated and unrated versions of the movie, and why this is true it's not exactly how I was hoping it would be formated. The Blu-ray disc contains the unrated version and the DVD looks to contain the same. The rated version of the movie comes as a voucher for a digital copy. Since I bought it for the unrated version I would have much rather received a unrated digital copy. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars. I think this is a really funny movie filled with great one liners. The unrated edition pulls no punched and has all the naughty jokes that a comedy about a phone sex line should include.

5323143,5,B009EU77NK,"My wife and I just watched this last night, and we didn't even get halfway through before looking to each other and saying in hushed, excited voices, ""This is REALLY gay."" And it is:  Protagonists Lauren and Katie build from realistically bickering roommates to a tender, sweet, and real-feeling romance, complete with ""I love yous"" and butt-grabs. The climax (no pun intended) even involves one of our main characters walking away from sex with her male love interest to reunite with the other so they can proclaim their love for each other.

Add this one to the shelf right next to ""But I'm a Cheeleader,"" ladies: we finally have another comedy about young lesbians that was written for us.",1451692800,,692,4.80672268907563
5323144,4,B009EU77NK,"In recent years, the direction of female comedies has taken a turn for the better. It was always believed that a comedy, featuring a mostly female cast, would only work as a buddy comedy. No one ever thought that women would ever be able to successful pull off a raunchy comedy, until Bridesmaids came along and changed all that. For A Good Time, Call... is from the same writers and producers as Bridesmaids and may even be funnier. The story begins with Lauren (Lauren Anne Miller) being dumped by her long time fiancee. On her own, Lauren can't afford the upscale apartment she's been living in, and is forced to move in with Katie, a promiscuous, pill popping OCD, who she'd only met once before, at a party, where Katie threw up on her. At first, the hostility is off the charts, but when Lauren loses her dream job, she is forced to help Katie run her business, a phone sex line. This film is not for the faint of heart, as it is very raunchy, to the point of shocking even me, someone who thinks they've seen it all. While this may seem like a great thing, the truth is, as with most single themed comedies, the longer it goes, the less funny it gets. At first, seeing the things these girls were saying and the people they were talking to was hilarious, but after an hour of  this film, it just really wasn't all the funny anymore. Both the female leads are terrific and they are the reason this film works. For A Good Time, Call... is very raunchy and very funny, but it has one centralized theme and doesn't deviate from it much at all. If not for the amazing young ladies who star in it, this film would have got tiresome a lot more quickly then it did. For a good time watch this movie, it's way out there, but some parts are truly hysterical.",1450828800,,1755,4.334346504559271

It was really funny, if not slightly stereotypical: dull girl meets crazy girl, forced together by chance, dull girl becomes less uptight, crazy girl becomes less crazy, though there are twists in it.

5323247,5,B009EU77NK,"Alert!  Alert!

Oh man!  This movie is downright RAW!  Some of the rawest humor I've watched since... well, Freeloaders this summer, lol.  It's about two young attractive women (Lauren Miller and Ari Graynor) who, after a pee splashing incident during a horrendous first impression, 10 years later the two ladies meet up again and eventually become friends/roommates and decide to run a phone sex business when they realized they have a talent for being and talking convincingly dirty... and dirty they are!

If I were to mention some of the dirtiest and best jokes, well, amazon wouldn't be very happy about that and my review would probably go bye bye, haha.  What I initially thought was going to be a typical Friends or How I Met Your Mother type storyline quickly turned towards a very sexual-oriented direction.  I can mention a few moments.  Only a few- this movie is totally covered in dirtiness so I have to be careful here!

Whenever Lauren's parents came over and she and her roommate had to hide their phone sex running business.  Eventually... well without spoiling it, the cat's out of the bag!  Seth Rogen is a naughty airplane pilot in the bathroom and the jokes he makes while on the phone might be some of the funniest lines I've ever heard from him, and the guy in the taxi... LOL!

There's surprises along the way too.  We find out interesting and surprising details about Ari Graylor's character.  It makes me feel bad for calling these moments ""surprises"" since the storyline itself is so insanely perverted that it's nothing compared to the kind of plot twists you'd see in a more sensible and recommendable film.  I like when the guy Ari was communicating with eventually meets up with Ari.  This is clearly the most civilized moment of the movie.

Lauren Miller is so gorgeous.  It's a shame she's so dirty!  Anyway you know, I hate to say it.  I really really do!  But the humor is absolutely hysterical and the storyline is even decent enough to carry the film due to some sharp writing.  You have to be in a certain state of mind and be open to perverted humor to really enjoy For a Good Time, Call, I admit.  Otherwise a pretty decent movie.

It is the story of two girls who had a nasty confrontation in college now forced due to economic circumstances to share a large apartment in New York City. Ari Graynor plays foul mouthed Katie and she is an outstanding comedic actress. Lauren Miller plays the vanilla upper class girl, who longs to become an editor, but due to circumstances joins Katie in a phone sex business. All supporting cast are also excellent, even their mutual male friend Jesse, played by Justin Long, as an over the top gay man who brings them together. The film is really about female friendship and not phone sex and it does a good job of exploring the development and sustainability of this friendship. Lauren Miller does a great job playing Lauren and she has the ability to present many faces to the camera. She is a very beautiful actress.

5323354,4,B009EU77NK,"I rented ""For a Good Time, Call.."" at Bellingham's local video store, Film Is Truth, and it was better than I originally thought. I have rented some terrible indie movies from Film is Truth, but this one was a breath of fresh air.

The film is about two young ladies, Katie and Lauren, who end up moving into an apartment together; Katie can't pay rent anymore by herself, and Lauren's boyfriend dumps her because they weren't having good enough sex. After Lauren moves in with Katie, she cannot find a good job as a writer. So Katie offers her a job operating a phone sex hot line with her. The two of them then decide to start their own hotline, and business is booming for them in no time.

But For A Good Time, Call.. is not just another r-rated comedy. It is actually a satire on what some young women do with their lives after they finish high school or college. I know young ladies (some of whom are single moms) who ended up stripping for a living because they could not find a decent job after they finished their Bachelor's degrees. When viewing the film, it reminded me a lot of them, and it made me laugh.

Also, Seth Rogen is featured for a short time in the film. He is a pilot who calls Lauren and Katie's hotline so he can jerk off in the men's lavatory before he has to fly the plane.

For A Good Time, Call.. is a great movie to watch for something to do on a Friday night. Check it out!",1374019200,,1405,4.211895910780669

The first 10 minutes, you think this movie is going to be vulgar and pointless, but once Lauren and Katie reconnect and they are forced to become roommates, this is when the film begins to pick up steam and come alive. Ari Graynor makes this film her own, finally a movie where she plays the lead! She's a combination between a cute Kate Hudson and a brassy Bette Midler. Graynor proves she is capable of handling the laughs and she also dramatic depth as well. Lauren Anne Miller who also co-wrote this film is delightful and just so freakin' adorable! I also wanted to mention that I really enjoyed Mark Webber, who plays Graynor's potential love interest, he is the real thing!

A mutual friend reunites them to solve their problem, and what goes from years of hatred for each other soon changes as they bond and become best of friends when they get into the phone sex business together and run their own 1900 number.

It doesn't sound like much of a plot, but then again, it's a comedy, and it is filled with laughs and good times, as well as puts in a bit of heart and soul. It may appear to some to be a chick flick, but it's got enough crude humor in it to keep the male audiences entertained... it's a kind of in between movie for both genders... therefor, it's a comedy I guess.

When they meet they remember they hate each other and it becomes tense, until they find a way to make more money then they ever dreamed of. The preview to this movie made it look very funny to me and I was excited about watching this. The cameos were great and the movie was funny but it was a little more girly then I was expecting. This is more then a movie about phone sex, its about friendship and being true to yourself. As cheesy as that sounds watch it and you will see what I mean. While there are some pretty racy things in this it's nothing over the top so don't expect a soft-core type movie. Overall, not as funny as I was expecting but still funny and worth seeing.

5323507,4,B009EU77NK,"This movie kicks ASS! The girls are super hot, the story is great - what could be better than a movie about a couple of girls starting a sex-related business, or changing an old enmity into a friendship? - and Seth Rogen makes a short appearance part way through the movie. The funnies part was when they signed a cute girl on to work with them who turns out to be an ""undercover agent of the lord"" and tries to ruin their business as ""phone whores"", telling them that ""Jesus saves""
. The only things I didn't like about it were Justin Long's ridiculous Apollo Ohno-esque goatie (sorry, that only looks good on the figure skater himself), the fact that he was one of maybe two or three recognizable actors in the movie - although the newcomers seemed pretty good, and the dreadlocked Caucasian female inmate at the end. I believe the actress who played her was in Superbad as Michael Cera's girlfriend (Martha MacIsaac). Seriously, the kid acts in movies with no black people whatsoever, she's the most non-black girl in modern day cinema, and she's sporting dreadlocks? Sorry, that just doesn't work. But there's plenty of girls in sexy looking outfits, dirty talking, and even an ad-shooting scene with girls naked in the tub! As well as the peeing-in-the-car scene from the trailer.

Give this movie a go, I have a feeling you won't be let down!",1357862400,,1348,4.640167364016737

It was mostly lighthearted, and I enjoyed the surprising little back story of Kate's character. It struck me as a real but different story, and I appreciated that she didn't fit perfectly into the box that I had put her into. I did find Lauren to be a little grating, but overall enjoyed the two of them. I also have found myself enjoying Mark Webber in a few recent movies, and look forward to seeing more from him.

Lauren MIller really won me over, I didn't remember seeing her in anything before this. And Justin Long is hilarious--I officially think he is an amazing actor after flip-flopping about it for years. The writing is great, the story doesn't miss a beat in my opinion, and the sexual innuendoes used comedically to portray the love of two best friends is hysterical. Give this movie a chance with an open mind and you will be laughing all the way through to the end, and definitely touched by the realistic love in this movie.
