Men of Honor: The Story of the US Army explores the growth and evolution of the US Army over the course of the twentieth century. This has been a period of dramatic growth and change in the size, strength, and composition of the US Armed Forces. The century opened with the US Army basking in the glory of its quick decisive victory in the Spanish American War. Five major wars and countless minor skirmishes later it prepares to enter the next century as the only remaining global superpower. In this period the US Army evolved from what was predominantly a cavalry force designed to fight the Indian Wars of the Great Plains, to a highly mobile mechanized army capable of being rapidly deployed to any of the world's many trouble spots. In Part I we examine the evolution of the US Army in the first half of the twentieth century, from a small cavalry force at the end of the nineteenth century to the successive expansions and contractions that it experienced over the course of World War I, World War II, and Korea.",1113782400,,1201,4.527777777777778
