Made in the 80's but plays off classic 1950's outer space movies.  I love that it is acted with a straight face all the way through.  And the teenagers are played by - shocking notion - actual teenagers!  Very cute, PG rated comedy that will make you laugh while groaning.",1442016000,,410,4.328947368421052

It is not that farfetched!

Starts off hokey - gets weirder.

There is an actual problem with the film and it is not the cheesy dialog or the inept special effects. It is the fact that they are too obviously contrived for the film. They try too hard to be campy and it shows. They try to make ""Old School"" films. What we need are fresher tomatoes.

So what's in your garden?",1349481600,,391,4.256756756756757

This movie is so bad, it's good.  I originally saw it many years ago on late night tv.  It has such a serious cheese factor that one must see it to believe it.  If you love movies that have some serious schlock, be sure to see this!

The basic plot is that aliens from another planet come to Earth and they are looking for love.  They decide the best place to find this is to be disguised as teenage girls in high school.  They woo high school boys away from their girl friends and all chaos ensues.  The special effects are horrible, the plot is cheesey, but it is *so* worth it.  Enjoy!",1223510400,,805,5.384
8216815,1,B000V6LT6W,"This movie is so bad on so many levels it defies description. It does not work well as an attempt to be another plan 9 from outer space which the director must have been trying copy. I have no idea why this is an unrated disk, there is no nudity in movie. It should have been rated ""G"". Save your time and money and look else where.",1198886400,,332,3.970149253731343
