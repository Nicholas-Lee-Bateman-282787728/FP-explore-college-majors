3534590,2,B001DM37UY,Pretty poor DVD quality. I gave it away. Why people still produce DVDs is beyond me. There's a new format called Bluray!.,1379721600,,121,4.545454545454546
3534591,1,B001DM37UY,This was not what I thought I was getting; a very short DVD.  Not worth purchasing.  Save your money and buy a different one or go on youtube and find much more then was on this DVD.,1356220800,,182,3.891891891891892
3534592,5,B001DM37UY,Great DVD bouoght back found memories well done and excellant price. I would buy it again and give it out as a gift.,1355356800,,116,4.086956521739131
3534593,3,B001DM37UY,"I was pleased with the quality of what was contained in the video but I expected highlights of the games not a michael phelps homage and a female child gymnast pouting to be half of the contents. There were many events at those games and almost all were over looked - even the majority of track and field events.
It was not possible to know this when ordering the dvd. I expected more ; a lot more unfortunately. This situation has not been the case at prevoius olympics post-event coverage.
Is there no package available that does truly cover all the highlights? I am disappointed as a sports fan and an armchair critic.",1261267200,3,621,4.504424778761062
3534594,1,B001DM37UY,"The opening ceremony was the most impressive ever, very doubtful it will ever be matched.
I was hoping to get a good summary of the opening and closing ceremonies, and as the name implies, highlights of the XXIX Olympiad.
It's mostly about USA's medal winners, receiving their medals and interviews of the winners.
USA is not the only country in this world!
In the world of HDTV, the video quality is not great.
(BUT If you are a relative of Phelps, you will love this dvd.)
Bought a new one that focusses on the ceremonies.",1230422400,,524,4.526315789473684
3534595,1,B001DM37UY,"If your idea of a ""highlight"" is to see runners crossing the finish line with their arms in the air, swimmers hugging after their race or athletes standing on the podium waiting to receive their medals then this DVD is for you. If you are looking for something a little more substantial....like actually seeing the race (or event) you will be very disappointed.",1227744000,28,361,4.746031746031746
3534596,5,B001DM37UY,"This piece is divided into two parts that are vastly based on selected live NBC television broadcasts during the games. The first part presents overall but general commentary and presentation of the finals in the events as they came along (but the bias toward showing United states triumphs is singular). The second part is more specific, and starts with a chapter on the colorful Olympic ceremony..this is spectacular. The other chapters are on finals in events that the United States (and let us say Jamaican sprinters notably Usain Bolt) excelled. Hence, the DVD is biased toward finals and medal wins in the track sprints and hurdles, swimming (Phelps is there, of course), women's beach volleyball Walsh and Treanor...the finals with China is shown in its entirety), gymnastics, and women's soccer. The obvious demerit is the bias toward the United States, the significant events in which the nation participated and achievd medals. Consequently, items like the middle and long-distance running track, men's soccer, weightlifting, wrestling, boxing, and less traditional sports are left out. You also get the impression that the DVD was hastily put together, and commercially targeted. Nevertheless, the editing is excellent, and the DVD was put out comparatively quickly. It is a fact, for example, that a definitive DVD on the Games in Athens 2004 has never emerged, to this day. I still give this Beijing Coverage 5 points, but would wish that a DVD that covers the events more broadly and internationally would be created. After all, is not that what Olympic Games are about? We do want to see the performances of the Ethiopians, Iranians, Greeks, Sri Lankans, etc...the peoples of the world! The DVD ""The Olympic Series,"" offers more broad perspectives on the Olympic events from 1920 to 2002, and it is one I would recommend to sports enthusiasts. And I would wish that this Beijing 2006 DVD were fashioned in that manner, or that a piece that is in the making would give us a more comprehensive presentation of the Games. Nevertheless, this Beijing DVD is excellent, though it will continue to generate negative notes, mostly depending on which events one prefers and what part of the world the reviewer is from. I rest my case!",1226707200,11,2240,5.040431266846361
3534597,2,B001DM37UY,"Trying to compress many hundred hours of Olympic events into a 2 hour DVD is a foolish project.  The main program on the DVD is a long music video, showing a few seconds each from many different events.  That is barely worth watching, but the special features are a little more interesting.  The special features do show a couple of dozen short events in their entirety, including all the Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt world record events.

The fantastic Olympic opening ceremonies are not included on this DVD, but there is a separate 3 hour DVD set for the ceremonies.  That set is much more interesting than this one.",1226534400,12,620,4.651376146788991
3534598,2,B001DM37UY,"I just recieved this in the mail and had missed much of the actual broadcast. I was hoping to get a good representation of the games here. Well make no mistake there is some good footage here. But sadly this whole DVD seems to be about American participation and medal winners. There are a few clips of the Jamaican runners.

But you'd be forgiven if you never knew that any other team but America mattered or won medals. I'm told that people in other countries get to watch much more balanced coverage than we do. On the basis of this DVD I'd guess that there was no boxing, no weightlifting, no boating events, no rhythmic gymnastics, no marathons, etc.

The actual highlights program is about 110 minutes. Not nearly enough to give anyone, except folks who need to chant U-S-A, an idea of the proceedings. Fortunately there are a couple of hours worth of actual NBC feed, mostly US medalists winning their events. There was also no critcal perspective whatsoever.

What would be nice would be something that gives us an idea what the athletes of the world were doing in Beijing in 2008. I miss the days when you could cheer the Kenyan runners or feel the political tension of the Ukrainian gymnasts. Instead we get the most isolationist vision of the world I've ever witnessed.",1223424000,20,1280,4.629955947136564

8294046,4,B001DM37UY,It was great.,1477353600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8294047,3,B001DM37UY,"I don't know what I thought when I first purchased this DVD. I guess there should have been more about the exotic location of Beijing, China than there was. I found the two hour highlight program to be quite boring at times. I didn't care so much about the games except for the opening and closing ceremonies for the summer games.

This DVD shows how the Chinese lit their torch in about twelve minutes. The DVD also shows special features like the men and women's swimming events. The DVD also gives selected performances from Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson; the gold medal victory beach volleyball match with Kerry Walsh and Misty May-Treanor; Gold Medal races of Usain Bolt at 100 and 200 meters; all of the Gold Medal performances from Track and Field.

In recent years, I have been growing disenchanted with NBC's coverage of the Olympics. The Opening and Closing Ceremonies are my favorite events of the summer games. I felt that the highlights could have shown more of Beijing and the people. NBC Sports seems to think that the best moments are the gold medal moments. There are plenty of sports and athletes and medals are only a small part of the Olympic experience.",1471910400,,1176,4.703883495145631

8294054,1,B001DM37UY,"The quality of the video is worse than an SLP Video if you remember those tapes. The sections of video are short and not very meaningful if you saw the whole thing. You will not see the spectacular opening and closing ceremony, so if you are looking for that, don't get this. There are no stories of the city, the construction of the venues or athletes either.

I would not recommend you buy this.",1398211200,,397,4.364864864864865
