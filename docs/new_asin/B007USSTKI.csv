8522005,5,B007USSTKI,"It has been my privilege to personally know Dr James Chan,Rick Schilling and Paul Mitchell for 20 or more years.  As an active member and chair of the Mid Atlantic Consultants Network in the Philadelphia area for 18 years, I observed them in many ways.  Their experience, integrity and candor is specifically focused on helping others to both evaluate consulting and learn from their experiences.  It truly demands all of us consultants to learn from their combined wisdom of 60+ years of consulting experience.  My large company experience in IBM, Exxon and M&M Mars has convinced me that they are so right when they say to be a consultant you need to have earned the right by being there and doing that.  Paul, Rick and James take it to a new level of having been there in consulting and speak to key issues of consulting.  Subject matter expertise, specialization, International and local approaches, traits of successful consultants, pricing, partnerships or not, coaching one another, marketing networking etc and minimum hours of consulting are all covered including the Ah-Ha experiences, in a very personal and compelling way.  This video is a must watch for ALL Consultants who need to get a refresher on why I am a consultant.  If you have been considering consulting instead of pursuing a job this video is also a must watch.  Take the time to watch it and re-watch it.  They are so right about so many issues you will want to let it all sink in.  Invest in the video but more importantly invest in yourselves and enjoy the experience.",1336780800,,1546,4.796226415094339
8522006,4,B007USSTKI,"Two insightful consultants address the key issues which are of interest to those considering such an occupation.
They discuss just what it means to be a consultant, how the solo practitioner differs from the large consultancies and how to compete successfully. They touch upon skill sets needed, including the ability and willingness to handle a wide variety of  routine tasks (filing, billing, correspondence, etc.) which in the large corporation would be handled by a subordinate. They deal with such key issues as how to get started, how to find clients and how to price one's services. They point out that the consultant needs actually to operate a business and that he/she is the business, the sad result of which is that upon retirement there probably is no other entity to whom this business would be of value: nothing to hand off.
All in all, while time apparently did not permit getting into more depth, the video provides a valuable  perspective by two established consultants who freely share their experiences.
This critique is by a consultant who has been a solo consultant for 28 years and has a published book, ""Careers in Consulting.""",1335052800,,1150,4.984375
