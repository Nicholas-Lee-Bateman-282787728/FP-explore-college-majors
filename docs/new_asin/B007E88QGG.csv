5079332,4,B007E88QGG,"Documentary is well done showing Joe Strummer (not his given name) from childhood all the way to his death (at 50, way too young).  This is not a documentary of the Clash per se.  It is more about the relationships Joe formed throughout his life and the people he affected.  There is also some comments from celebrities such as Johnny Depp.  There were some issues I had with the film:  1. They would not (or rarely) show  the names of those speaking.  It became somewhat of a distraction after awhile. 2. The film did not really explore the influences of other members in The Clash.  Paul Simonon was barely mentioned and the contribution of Mick Jones was underplayed.  There is no Clash without Mick Jones. 3.  I think I learned a lot about Joe Strummer but there was few direct interviews with him that would help us know how he ticked.  4.  I also think they downplayed the incredible musical ability of The Clash.  They did not just put out politically inspired songs but could also write fantastic rock and roll music.

In any case, I would still highly recommend this film to any fan of the Clash and Joe Strummer.  Strummer was a true great artist and never sold out.  This film reveals, probably better then any, the influence he had on his fans and those who knew him best.",1402963200,3,1284,4.4935064935064934

8515102,5,B007E88QGG,"An extraordinarily loving & unsentimental peek at an Artist taken after his physical life ended....& a reminder that no one is guaranteed a tomorrow.
I remember, far too well, being hit by the news that Joe Strmmer had been struck down by a heart attack. That made absolutely ZERO sense.
Later, it was revealed that he had a congenital hole in his heart...THAT made much more sense - after all, he'd spent his entire professional life leaking its contents into the lives of all who loved him from afar, listening to every word he shared, internalizing his haunted vocals & mid-expanding lyrics.  If you know what I'm sayin' - I'm willing to bet that, thinking about your life, without Joe Strummer? It's literary impossible - he changed you & to even try, too painful.
If you are already a fan, I think you'll find this to be a fitting memorial...but definitely NOT the last chapter & verse (hence the title)
If you're not a fan...that's qualified by the word, ""yet"" - and this film is actually, a great introduction.",1477440000,,1017,4.681564245810056
