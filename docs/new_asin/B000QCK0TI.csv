8195420,5,B000QCK0TI,there is a book that goes with the dvd set. i suggest having each. much more helpful and a joy to use together.,1304380800,,111,3.869565217391304
8195421,4,B000QCK0TI,"I originally got this DVD from the library. Unfortunately, the disc was scratched so it stopped playing altogether after a short time. What I was able to  watch was good for me because I really need to see each step several times. Tracies findernails are way too long for a teaching video; very distracting. Also, she should have used a light color yarn so the viewer could see the stitchs as they are created. This video isn't available by some online sellers so I'm going with another instructor who got great reviews.",1301616000,,520,4.6521739130434785
8195422,5,B000QCK0TI,"Bought these for my wife when she mentioned it might be fun to learn how to knit. She's had no experience ever and now she's totally hooked! They have great instructions in getting started and now she's knitting whenever we're watching tv.
Have to say - fantastic!
This is a perfect dvd learning set for beginning knitters. Great value for the price! I recommended it.",1293667200,6,368,4.676923076923077
8195423,1,B000QCK0TI,"I'm posting this review on ALL of the disc sites I can find for any of these discs!
I didn't have any reviews to go by when I bought this, and I wish I'd waited, but then that would have been someone else's tough luck.

I ordered the set of 5 videos and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!

First, each DVD contains MAYBE one hour of instruction, so these could have all been put on one video & been a much better deal.
Secondly, altho the teaching is fair, this doesn't teach anything you couldn't learn yourself from a product called ""I Taught Myself How to Knit!"", which comes with needles & the basic necessities you need to start knitting.
The Fair Isle DVD doesn't actually teach you two-handed Fair Isle color knitting, which is what I really wanted to learn. It teaches you how to knit right-handed with two colors, laying one down & picking the other up - THIS IS NOT 2-HANDED KNITTING!

All in all, I'm very disappointed in the set of DVDs; I wouldn't recommend them to anyone, unless you find a used set of all 5 DVDs (probably mine!), here or at a garage sale; and I wouldn't recommend you spend more than $5 for all of them.",1236211200,10,1124,4.317535545023697
8195424,4,B000QCK0TI,"Bought this for my daughter as a gift and she said the first dvd in the series was very basic but the others she found to be very helpful in teaching her techniques she was unfamiliar with. She also stated that the person who is doing the video was going sometimes too fast and she had to pause and rewind.
Otherwise a good buy.",1210809600,8,328,4.140625
8195425,4,B000QCK0TI,"Instructions are very clear and easy to follow. Had no problem following along with the DVDs. Found it nice to be able to repeat instructions from disk.

Down side - no written instructions until you get to DVD #4 & 5. I had to create my own. Found the presenter's very long finger nails distracting due to the unsual design on them. But I finished my projects with ease.

Would recommend them, but would like to see a better quality put into the finished project.",1199750400,18,464,4.447058823529412
