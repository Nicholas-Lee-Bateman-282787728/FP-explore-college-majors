5074454,5,B0077NF7GU,"Entertaining and enlightening. A different point of view about cuban's real life in from the perspective of zombie killers Juan and his side kick Lazaro.
Very enjoyable.",1344902400,,169,5.296296296296297
5074455,5,B0077NF7GU,"I was lucky enough to watch this in Havana and let me tell you this is the greatest movie EVER! It's hilarious and cleanly done. I love the script, the actors, and the make-up. Enjoy!",1344297600,,183,4.257142857142857
5074456,5,B0077NF7GU,"I waited months to see this movie and when it finally was shown in NYC, I invited my friends to go see it with me. The movie definitely exceeded my expectations and my friends loved it.

Juan de los Muertos is funny as hell and very witty. Without creating political debates, it delves into Cuba's political background and social reality in a humorous way.

The actors, some good, some not so much, were very enjoyable to watch. They had great chemistry and it really felt as if they were having a blast doing this movie. You really fall in love with these characters.

The graphics were better than I expected, given that I had read some negative reviews about that. I actually liked them. I mean, this is a zombie movie, you don't want it to look like some slick Hollywood production.",1343520000,27,786,4.52112676056338
5074457,5,B0077NF7GU,I have been into zombie movies and books for 30 years. In the last few years they have gotten stale and boring. This movie is as fresh as it can get! Fantastic movie from the land of Castro. Its got it all if you like good makeup and watching the normal guy fighting zombies without it being too unrealistic then it's a must watch for the true zombie movie fan. It's about a loser and his buddies taking a bad situation and trying to turn a profit. Really funny and serious when it need to be. Heck it even ends with Sid Vicious's My Way. If you liked Shaun of the Dead and Tokyo Zombie then you will love this movie because its way better then both combined! Your collection will not be complete without this amazing movie.,1339632000,5,724,4.253623188405797
5074458,5,B0077NF7GU,"Juan of the Dead is an excellent film that gives a very unique and comedic perspective on Cuba.  I don't know much about Cuba outside of this film, and I don't know any Spanish, so the English subtitles definitely helped.  I loved this film as both a comedy and a foreign film.  I thought seeing the city in Cuba was very interesting, as it was somewhere that I hadn't really seen before, and it was very interesting to see the people there in Cuba as well.",1482883200,,457,4.290697674418604
5074459,4,B0077NF7GU,"Great alternative look at Zombie  meme. This Cuban version of Shaun of the Dead, is a fascinating new look, not only into the fun of modern Zombie lore, but an interesting look into Cuban culture under Castro. I recommend it to anybody with an open mind and a good sense of humor.",1481587200,,280,4.384615384615385
5074460,1,B0077NF7GU,"2nd time I order this blu-ray in over a year. The audio is bad. I thought that after a year, the issue would have been fixed. Apparently not. Seems the Spanish audio tracks are messed up. The center channel ALSO comes out the rear right speaker! The English audio track is only in 2.0, so you don't notice the issue there. But I don't want to hear that track!",1480377600,,359,4.217391304347826

5074464,5,B0077NF7GU,This film makes me want to see more films out of Cuba. It's a hilarious take on the genre with some glimpses into Cuban culture and history. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Don't like zombie films? Still need to watch this one.,1466208000,,242,4.4

5074470,1,B0077NF7GU,"Based on the reviews I bought this. My mistake was I didn't realize I was getting dubbed version. The voiceovers were terrible & the voices didn't seem to match the actor for me. Wish I would've known that & tried to get the Spanish language version w/subtitles, might've liked it more. That being said, the things that I assume were supposed to be funny, seemed forced & obvious and not funny to me & the one guy jacking off all the time was just really not funny here. It seemed like someone had a 'funny checklist' & were ticking off the boxes as items were included. Didn't finish watching it, threw it in the for sale bin.",1459468800,2,627,4.367521367521367

5074472,5,B0077NF7GU,"The absolute funniest of all the zombie spoof movies.  Witty, irreverent, smartly written and beautifully acted, this movie pokes fun at just about everything while still conveying a serious and sometimes tragic perspective about life in Cuba.  How this movie ever got made under the Castro regime is a miracle.",1457913600,,311,5.2

5074474,5,B0077NF7GU,"This is a dark comedy like none I have seen before. The story takes place in modern day Cuba and the dialogue is all in Spanish with English subtitles. The real flavor of this story you can only get if you speak Spanish, the subtitles do a good job of translation but there's nothing like hearing the lines in an unmistakable Cuban slang and with an authentic Cuban accent. I loved it.",1450051200,3,385,4.361111111111111

5074491,3,B0077NF7GU,I didn't laugh.  I didn't cry.  It didn't change my life.  It's a zombie flick in a different environment ( Communist Cuba ). A couple of situations we haven't seen before.  I DID get a couple chuckles here and there.  Shoestring budget for the FX but they are adequate.  Worth checking out.,1437696000,,291,4.5

Some good historical references. As I don't know much of Cuban history, I even learned a bit while watching a really funny comedy.

Liked the actors, the story, and the aesthetics of the film.  Would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend",1435017600,,393,4.735294117647059

5074514,4,B0077NF7GU,"Weird and good. The movie I assume was made entirely in Cuba. Its a fun take on the Zombie craze. Worth watching.

5074515,5,B0077NF7GU,"I found this Cuban zombie film hilarious. The deadpan irreverence to the sacred cows of the Cuban revolution provided as many laughs as anything else. My wife and I (both dancers) found the zombie salsa dance routine priceless. If you've got a deranged sense of humor and are cynical about politics, this is for you.",1415059200,,316,4.763636363636364
5074516,5,B0077NF7GU,"Wow. I mean, wow.

I don't watch a lot of Cuban cinema, but what films make their way out of Cuba tend to be artsy or romantic. This one is definitely an exception.

An action-comedy with zombie horror, not to mention a lot of political commentary. The commentary is very natural-seeming, and doesn't feel out of place as it sometimes can in what is basically a genre film. It never gets heavy-handed.

It helps that it is *genuinely* funny, with both the humor and plot being driven by character dynamics, mixed in with the slapstick, political humor, and occasional juvenile humor, in proportions that just works in all the right ways.

The body-horror and deaths of characters you've become fond of is expected from this kind of movie, as well as some of the unlikely ways the cast solve the survival situations.

It gets incredibly silly in some parts, to the point where it may break your suspension of disbelief (some slackers and layabouts suddenly have Matrix-ish kung-fu powers for just one example), but really it didn't bug me at all. If anything, it added to the fun vibe they were actually going for.",1413849600,,1113,4.716494845360825
5074517,4,B0077NF7GU,Totally worth watching. Not scary and a different take on the zombie apocalypse.,1413417600,,80,5.230769230769231
5074518,5,B0077NF7GU,"The buffering and constant interruptions in audio and video were incredibly distracting and made this otherwise stellar zombie movie difficult and annoying to watch. I'm done with Amazon Instant Video and will just stick with Netflix.

If you are in to the Zombie movie/tv show genre as much as my husband and I are and you know just how horrible most of them can be you will really appreciate Juan of the Dead. It is a fun, bloody, laugh-a-minute romp through Cuba with a bungling yet affable group of characters. A wonderful movie you will want to watch over and over again...promise!",1410393600,,586,4.745098039215686
5074519,5,B0077NF7GU,"Who know the zombie apocalypse could be big business?  When the zombie apocalypse comes, Juan and his aimless friends take advantage.  The resulting film had me laughing in fits.  I'm pretty tired of apocalyptic films, but this one hit my funny bone as did Shaun of the Dead - but in a completely different way.  Not only that, it serves as a greater allegory for the way people behave even when they know there is something wrong.  Set in Cuba.  (I know - like we ever see Cuban films.)",1409443200,,487,4.415730337078652

I was hoping that it was english dubbed but it wasn't, It takes a little away from the movie when you have to read what they are saying because it's in spanish.  It was still very entertaining and we enjoyed it a lot.
Worth a watch for the zombie fan.",1405987200,,472,3.9368421052631577

5074522,5,B0077NF7GU,"Although it  doesn't sport English as an audible language, this flick is fantastic. Great dark humor. This one's a keeper-",1405123200,,122,5.1
5074523,5,B0077NF7GU,"I ask one thing above all else of a horror - and in particular a zombie - movie: surprise me.  And, of course, by ""surprise"" I don't mean having someone leap out of nowhere; rather, I mean, bringing something original to the genre - and ""Juan of the Dead"" succeeds in spades on that one.  Yes, if you can scare me too that would be nice; but having watched so many horror films over such a long period, I don't honestly believe any movie's really, truly going to scare me very much.  Also, while the movie is long on innuendo and even whimsy, it is mercifully short on gore - even when a virtual army of zombies are beheaded en masse.

I was a little leery going into this film since the blurb on the DVD case flat out compares it to ""Shaun of the Dead.""  But, to my pleasant surprise, ""Juan of the Dead"" bears no resemblance other than in the title.  Nor does it bear much resemblance to other foreign language zombie films - and for one primary reason: I had to actually read the English subtitles at the bottom of the screen, word by word.  Why?  Because there really was a story here; and that story was indigenous to the setting - Havana, Cuba; whereas almost every other zombie film I've seen that had sub-titles could have taken place anywhere in the world.  And whereas the dialogue of most zombie films is strictly survival oriented, the dialogue here was mostly based on the culture where the story takes place.  In fact, only one character in the entire film - an American preacher with a stillborn plan to save the survivors - ever referred to the zombies as ""zombies.""  They were mostly depicted simply as ""dissidents.""  And their sudden appearance on the scene was simply taken for granted - no attempt was made to figure out how they became zombies; the prevailing attitude was ""oh well, here they are...we'll have to find a way around them so we can go on with our normal life.""  In fact it was only near the end that leaving Havana was even considered an option.

The movie it reminded most of, particularly in the main characters' laid back attitude, was the British zombie flick ""Dog House.""  Like the characters in ""Dog House,"" Juan and his friends never really took the zombies all that seriously; and, accordingly, never took great pains to thwart their attack or to make their way past them.  Quite frequently, when some characteristic of the zombies was pointed out, the response was to shrug it off as pretty much like the people's normal routine anyway.  And in its suggestion of the attempt to preserve normalcy in the midst of a zombie onslaught, it reminded me a great deal of the zombie movie ""The Mad"" starring Billy Zane, wherein the zombies are not even discovered to be undead until they have already wreaked havoc on the community.

The ending leaves the viewer with a quandary: when the others escape, in a makeshift boat, Juan chooses to remain behind.  Given his encounter with a zombie while saving a boy just minutes before he's to join the others, one has to wonder if he was bitten or if, as he tells them, he doesn't want to leave Cuba.  It's a mystery, and always will be.",1404604800,8,3116,4.50088809946714
5074524,5,B0077NF7GU,"I truly love this movie.  Not just because the zombies, but the way producer was able to express his feelings for his Country, where in reality, would be a disaster.  He uses comedy to do what he shouldn't.  Even though you have to use English subtitles, it does not diminish the film.  These actors are fantastically, comedic.  This is one of my favorite zombie films.  One of the main reasons, being, the actors.  They are just so fun.  If you enjoy zombies and comedy, you will love to see this.

Otherwise, the zombie apocalypse of the ""disidentes"" won't make a lot of sense.

5074562,3,B0077NF7GU,"This low budget movie rides the crest of the zombie apocalypse fad. It is similar to three other ones who use humor to deal with the topic of zombies (the other ones being excellent: Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, and Warm Bodies).

The plot follows the usual pattern, relieved by the comedy. One of the survivors is his buddy who accidentally harpoons live, non-zombies. Another is a huge, muscular guy who faints at the sight of blood and so, has to be led around blindfolded so he doesn't faint at the sight of bloodied zombies, but he fights them off through the instructions of his flaming gay lover. The movie also has a number of jabs at the government: the government spokesman refers to the zombies as being really dissidents in the pay of the Americans. Also, what does Juan decide to do when the Socialist world is collapsing all around him? Why, he goes for capitalism and establishes a business. When he answers the phone, he says, ""Juan of the Dead. We kill your loved ones. How can I help you?""

There is one scene where a large number of zombies are killed at once that is as good a scene as I have ever seen in a zombie film.

5074564,4,B0077NF7GU,"Juan of the Dead is a zombie comedy.  If you are not a fan of this genre, you will probably not enjoy the film.  However, if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, Fido, and other similar films this movie is definitely worth your time.

The movie centers around Juan, living aimlessly in Havana (the movie shows how beautiful Cuba can be, and how sad and decayed life in Havana is under communism).  He spends his time on fishing and petty crime along with his similarly minded associates.  Juan has survived many bad times (there is mention of Angola and the ""special period"" of starvation in Cuba) and has no desire to leave Cuba, considering himself a survivor.  His primary emotional attachment is to his estranged daughter, who thinks little of him and tells him that she and her mother are moving to Miami (mom is already in Spain).

The movie shows the zombie outbreak through the lens of state media, where the zombies are mistaken as ""dissidents"" supported or directed by Americans.  The official story wears thin as time goes on (and society collapses).  Juan and his associates try to maintain their existence through the downward spiral.  Finally, the group (with Juan's daughter) start a ""business"" of zombie eradication -- being paid to deal with their customers re-animated loved ones.

There are many fun scenes and plot developments that give laugh out loud moments.  There are some times when the movie loses focus and scenes seem disjointed.  Some (American) viewers may not get (or appreciate) some of the ""in"" jokes regarding Cuba, communism, machismo, etc.  If you can get past that, I think you will find this is a fun film and a worthy addition to the genre.",1363219200,,1674,4.767361111111111

This movie is successful on so many levels, but especially as a subtle political satire of life (?) under Castro.  It pays homage to so many different films, including its namesake.

Surprisingly high production values; excellent editing; and the director has a deft hand at framing certain shots (note the shot of Juan looking at the photograph of his estranged wife and daughter).

There is a key scene which, I swear, could have been lifted from Max Brooks' classic novel World War Z.  Z fans will recognize the scene when they see it.

5074578,5,B0077NF7GU,"Yes another Zomedy and what can be wrong with that, this one sees Cuba finally lurching slowly onto the Zombie comedy bandwagon, and they do so with style and lan. It stars Juan who with best mate Lazaro does fishing on a home made raft, he quite clearly is not a shining example of success from the worlds leading socialist island.

He has a thing for the ladies and he is separated from his wife and his daughter is fairly unimpressed with the ageing Lothario. Then strange things start to happen around the island involving what the authorities call `dissidents' that are clearly sponsored by the US government. It doesn't take too long for extreme acts of dissidents to spread and soon Zombies are appearing all over the place.

Meanwhile Juan and some of his neighbours are holed up in his flat, that clearly needs a lick of paint, and they weigh up their options and decide to fight back and as in all good comedies, hilarity does ensue. The band of freedom fighters are a very Motley Crew indeed which include a Muscle Mary who faints at the sight of blood and they use any weapon they can from nun chucks to boat paddles - genius.

This is a brilliant and refreshing film which although it has Zombies at its core has a great big heart that it wears on its sleeve all tied up with more gags than you can shake a stick at. It has very good sub titles and runs to just over an hour and a half and I enjoyed every minute of it.

5074586,4,B0077NF7GU,"This movie is not a Spanish language version of the hilarious UK film ""Shaun of the Dead"".  While both films provide generous doses of black comedy and slapstick, ""Juan of the Dead"" concentrates squarely on political satire.

The zombie apocalypse that engulfs Cuba throughout the film is a metaphor for the crumbling political, social and economic infrastructure of the small socialist state.  The satire isn't too heavy handed and is always accompanied by generous doses of humour.  State television refers to the undead roaming the streets as ""dissidents"" and blames the influence of the United States for disrupting the island.  All the while, a sense of decay steadily overwhelms every aspect of Cuban life.

There are some truly funny scenes in this movie. Watch carefully for the hilarious rooftop scene between the two ""slacker"" mates as the sun rises.

5074589,4,B0077NF7GU,"I don't know that JUAN OF THE DEAD is the panacea for zombie fatigue. I can't attest to its landmark creds, JUAN OF THE DEAD supposedly the first zombie film to come out of Cuba. And the parallels to SHAUN OF THE DEAD are glaringly obvious. I do know that I had a lot of fun watching it. That, in terms of viewer gratification, JUAN OF THE DEAD makes a fine ambassador to world cinema. Who knew a Cuban cast & crew can shoot a subversive picture in Cuba that pokes fun at their own government and not get, uh, frowned at for it? I did hear the film's early screening took place at the firing range (no, it didn't).

Tall and gangly slacker Juan (Alexis Daz de Villegas) has a mantra: ""I survived Mariel, I survived Angola, I survived the Special Period... Just give me a chance, and I'll sort it out."" Both at 40-something, he and his bumbling best friend Lazaro (Jorge Molina) have reached that age in which regret at having lived a wasted life begins to eat away. In repressed Havana, Cuba, Juan and Lazaro are caught in day-to-day inertia. Sometimes they eke out a living by fishing off their raft. And, sometimes, they indulge in petty crimes. To Juan's ongoing dismay, his estranged daughter Camila (Andrea Duro) wants no part of him. I think she's very sensible. Juan dreams of redeeming himself in his kid's eyes. Here's his chance coming.

Should the zombie apocalypse hit Havana, could you tell the difference? That's one of the running jokes that abound in this film. Promising writer/director Alejandro Brugus injects his pet project with irreverence. He lobs wicked social commentary at the expense of the Castro administration and what it's wrought. In Cuba, Miami is viewed as the promised land. Characters in the film occasionally voice an ongoing internal conflict: stay home with their roots or seek out a better life across the waters. As the infection grows, Cuban news media quickly appoint most of the blame to US-affiliated ""dissidents"" (and a bit of the blame on the ""expired drugs at the polyclinic"").

But where others eye the end of the world, Juan sees opportunity. He gathers his motley posse and launches a zombie-slaying service. Nowadays, he answers the telephone like so: ""Juan of the Dead. We kill your loved ones."" But, of course, in Spanish. Not a news flash: JUAN OF THE DEAD - or ""Juan de los muertos"" - is filmed in Spanish with English sub-titles.

JUAN OF THE DEAD is both hilarious send-up and gory splatterfest, a credible cousin to SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Lead actor Alexis Daz de Villegas, who himself boasts a zombie's wasted musculature, heads a cast that seems to be having fun but not neglecting to put in some good work. Amidst the snide tomfoolery, there's good character development and also moments of pathos. I think I'll keep an eye out for more of this director's work. Against all odds, Alejandro Brugus has crafted a highly watchable picture. Even Fidel Castro gave this one a thumbs up (no, he didn't).

The DVD's bonus stuff:

5074592,3,B0077NF7GU,It was a fun movie and worth watching. But having to read subtitles is never conducive to Action Flicks. I would much rather an English dubbed version.,1353715200,,151,4.62962962962963
5074593,3,B0077NF7GU,"I really had my hopes up for this movie, especially considering the high rating reviews it was getting.  I will give the movie points for its exotic setting and for sneaking in some subtle geo-political satire along with its walking dead, but I just didn't think the overall effect was as potent as some reviews make it seem.

Slacker Juan and his friends turn entrepreneurial when a plague of zombies hits Havana - for a fee, they will rid you of your dead loved ones.  Juan and his misfit crew are the closest thing that Cuba has for heroes, but when Juan finally turn away from merely pecuniary interests toward humanitarian, he finds a zeal for his country and the love of his daughter that he'd never had before.

The 'zombie slacker' film pioneered by Simon Pegg in Shaun of the Dead was, in the beginning, a great twist on a concept starting to grow cold.  It still can be an effective satirical tool, and Juan of the Dead does score some points off of U.S-Cuban relations, the Cuban culture, and human nature in general.  That was probably where the movie was most successful.  There is also a lot more of the film that veers toward slapstick, or at least broad comedy, which some viewers will appreciate and others won't.

Though the comedy is uneven, the acting is good.  Special effects are about on par with an Asylum film.  Zombie junkies should check it out, but keep your expectations down.",1353628800,3,1405,4.584

5074595,4,B0077NF7GU,"""Juan of the Dead"" is in short ""Zombies in Havana."" Sounds interesting, isn't it? The story is about the titular Juan (Alexis D&iacute;az de Villegas), a forty-something slacker whose wife has left him (and the country, too). One day an old man he knows starts acting strangely, like trying to bite him. The government blames the domestic ""dissidents"" and foreign intervention for the bloody chaos that follows. So what should Juan do? Start up a company with his slacker friend Lazaro (Jorge Molina) and make money by getting rid of the ""dissidents,"" of course!

First, a Spanish-Cuban movie ""Juan of the Dead"" (""Juan de los Muertos"") is a comedy. Or I should call it a zombie horror comedy. ""Juan"" does parody the zombie movie genre's numerous conventions as ""Shaun of the Dead"" does, but what is really great about Alejandro Brugu&eacute;s' film is the film's satirical edge that is aimed at the country's current situation. The two main characters' behaviors are for the most part far from heroic, and probably that is exactly the point.

As a zombie film, the story is decent with several gory scenes. The gore effects are acceptable; make-up effects are passable; and the film shows several unique ways to dispatch zombies (don't miss the unforgettable Revolution Square scene). Maybe some think that with better special effects they could have been more efficient, but raw and uneven as it is, ""Juan of the Dead"" delivers.",1353024000,,1429,4.97489539748954
5074596,4,B0077NF7GU,"Irreverent, bloody, laugh-out-loud fun.

That is exactly what happened to me with ""Juan of the Dead"". A native Spanish Speaker will know, after watching the movie, what I say. The spiciness of words and scenes, done by the Cuban actors, is just hilarious. I had a great time watching it and had a good laugh at it. The plot is simple and very colorful, as we Latin people are. The main roll is well performed. It seems this main actor is very popular in Cuban films. At the beginning of the movie, the statement of the main character brings a lot to the idiosyncrasy in telling the audience how people see life in our society. The friendship between the main roll and the supporting one is just delightful. The typical mannerism of the people is just funny and portraits exactly how we react to trouble. I do recommend the movie for a light and good laugh. The zombies, to me, was just a side element to the movie. Finally, ""Juan of the Dead"" brings this awkward sense of funny spirit when things go wrong.",1348185600,,1110,4.414634146341464

It was more of a funny look at Cuba and Cuba/American relations set to a zombie Apocalypse.  There wasn't a lot of gore, as far as gore goes, but there were deaths.  Lots of deaths.  Lots of funny deaths.  Hilarious deaths.

The  movie does sort of just come to an end without the problems being resolved in my mind.  And not in a cliffhanger kind of way, it just ends unsatisfactorily.

It does an incredible job taking the comical zombie genre to Cuba with an excellent set of characters that keep you laughing all the way through.  The characters definitely take some shots at the Cuban socialist system while still keeping their Cuban pride, but creating a capitalistic approach to dealing with the islands zombie problem.

I laughed, cringed, and even jumped a couple of times!  I love all the of the characters but Juan and China are my favorite, Lazaro, Vladi and Camilla round out the cast of main characters nicely.

Other than a similar film title, and the fact it is a dark comedy, and there are zombies, are pretty much the only similarities.  This Cuban (with English subtitles) movie's alive humans we follow the lives of are criminals, they like to steal and bludge off of Cuban society and perve on neighbourhood women through their telescope on the roof of their apartment building.  Early on the film the question of should we try and get to Miami one day is asked as they are floating fishing in the ocean, and the main character replies, no way, then I'd have to work. When the zombie outbreak occurs, they decide to take advantage of other desperate survivors, by starting their Zombie errradication business which they call and answer their buildings' rooftop payphone number with Jaun of the Dead.

It's not a bad movie, it's as good as most zombie films out there, but the zombie's aren't anywhere in the league of The Walking Dead's corpses and as far as comedy zombie films go, it's a long way off Shaun, Adventureland, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse and others. It's refreshing that all the actors in this aren't your typical Hollywood style beautiful people, none of them could be mistaken for models, instead everyone looks like regular people, with fat guts and so forth.",1486166400,,1413,4.708502024291498
