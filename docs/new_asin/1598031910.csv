7799902,5,1598031910,"As a lifelong amateur student of the Bible, I thought I knew quite a bit until I got to this course.  Dr. Rendsburg is neither a biblical literalist nor a proponent of the JEDP Theory for the composition of the Torah (which views it as a heavily edited work of multiple authors from several centuries).  He takes the Book of Genesis seriously, accepting the historical nature of the basic stories from Abraham and after, but also accepting that these stories are told in epic fashion, creating great stories that are built on the back of basic history.  And above all, he sees Genesis as a dramatic work masterfully crafted to make good stories.  He delves into a lot of detailed observations about the text but in ways that I always found interesting and thought-provoking.  I don't think I will ever read Genesis again without seeing much more than I ever saw before.  This course was fascinating and well worth my time.  Caution:  In the first two or three lectures, he is a bit stilted in his presentation style, but he loosens up after that.",1408320000,,1046,4.646739130434782
7799903,2,1598031910,"The instructor has an odd, distracting way of speaking. He sounds like a robot. The content of his lecture is informative but presented more like a sermon in temple or church than a lecture in class. Furthermore, he is excessively repetitive as if the listener is attempting to commit the information to memory. If you can get pass those distractions, the content is worth the trouble.",1375401600,2,385,4.848484848484849
7799904,4,1598031910,"This series treats the book of Genesis with respect and scholarship.  The presenter looks at Genesis as literature and views it through the lens of historical and theological perspectives.  He uses archaeological finds to bring clarity to passages and delves into the sacred writings of other cultures to show how the Israelites were likely influenced by those other societies.  But also showing how the Israelites differed and why.

I gave it four stars for two reasons.  First, the presenter gets ""into the weeds"" at some points and I found myself not really caring about the issues he was addressing.  That did not happen ofter and overall the material is excellent.

The other reason for four stars is the presenter.  He starts slowly and almost appears to be uncomfortable with the format.  He improves somewhat after the first three or four lectures but never seems fully comfortable.  Having said that, the viewer will come to accept his presentation style and be able to learn from his material.

For the person who has skipped over Genesis, treating it as either a bunch of myths or as stories that should be taken literally at every point, this series will be very instructive. It will also be of value to the person who has wondered how and why these stories appeared at all.  You will come out of it appreciating how the writers (or writer) of this book of beginnings had reasons for what was written and that those reasons helped the Jewish people understand their religion more fully and themselves as a people.",1365552000,6,1525,4.823076923076923
