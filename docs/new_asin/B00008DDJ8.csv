1835501,5,B00008DDJ8,I have been using the Firm Body Sculpting system for about 4 and half months.  I have really seen some good results but wanted something new to work out to.  I recently purchased this video about two days ago and worked out to this last night.  This is one of the best.  You will get lower and upper and ab work all on this one tape. I agree with some of the comments I have read about some of the older firm tapes which I have purchased that the instructors are not friendly and the music is kind of cheesy but this video has great music and instructors.  If you want a total body work out this is the tape.  This will be my favorite for some time.,1051833600,21,649,4.03125
1835561,5,B00008DDJ8,"Been using this workout for YEARS on a VCR TAPE.  Finally decided to replace with a DVD just in case my VCR tape ever breaks... or the VCR itself.  Highly recommend this very solid, basic workout video for total body sculpting.",1426204800,,227,4.512195121951219
1835562,5,B00008DDJ8,"This is The Firm video I do every single week without fail. It's perfect for beginners and even better for intermediate people like myself. The Upper Body segment is my favorite. It's not tiring, but you really feel it working. The Lower Body segment is really tough; when I get to the first set of Leg Presses, that's when I start to really sweat. The Abs segment is all of 9 minutes long, but it's still challenging and I can feel it working every time. I was stuck at one weight for months when I was doing the TransFIRMation system earlier this year. Now that I'm using the Fanny Lifter again, I've lost 14 pounds in 3 months! That's the one drawback to this video: You need the Fanny Lifter to exercise to this video. Still, it's not hard to find a Fanny Lifter; the official website firmdirect.com sells them, and I'm sure they're available for a relatively low price here on amazon.com. No matter how you get a hold of the Fanny Lifter, get this video! It's faster and easier than doing the Cardio Sculpt or Body Sculpt, and it's just as effective.",1411516800,3,1055,4.443298969072165
1835563,2,B00008DDJ8,"This seemed to be a recycle of ""The Firm"" exercise material I already have (ex: Body Sculpting System-Cardio Sculpt & Body Sculpt). I cannot comment on the entire video b/c I was too bored & feeling ripped off to finish. The instructor did not motivate or inspire me- I regret this purchase.",1410480000,,291,4.615384615384615

1835565,5,B00008DDJ8,"Seems very effective, however, at my age it is a bit ""over my head"". Not for beginners but very good.  I hope to work my way up to this standard.

**Update- I am happy to say that performing this DVD is no longer out of reach, and it has truly made me stronger, not to mention visibly tighter in my physique.",1394064000,,308,4.032786885245901
1835566,2,B00008DDJ8,"This was disappointing, I was hoping for a ""super body"" scupting workout and it's mostly sitting on the step lifting weights, no calorie burning moves that go along with sculpting.  The instrutor is a snooze too.",1393977600,4,212,4.888888888888889
1835567,5,B00008DDJ8,"I really love this workout because it is just enough and not too much! When I am finished, I know I've worked my body and feel it the next day. It is a challenge, but not overwhelming and it is just the right length of time for me. As someone who is older (just turned 60), this is a perfect workout to tone my muscles, increase strength, and feel great.",1371772800,2,354,4.071428571428571

1835570,3,B00008DDJ8,"I didn't bother to read the reviews as I had seen this dvd recommended on a Web MD site. No where in the description of the dvd did it list equipment needed, so I assumed I'd need dumbells (which I have) and purchased it. Now I realize I need an expensive Fanny Lifter that doesn't even exist anymore. I can't buy it on Amazon at all which is what affected my rating. I'll probably try to sub with a cooler....I started with a step stool but it wasn't nearly tall enough for the sitting arm workouts. I even tried to buy directly from The Firm website and the Fanny Lifter is not on there AT ALL! Really wish there was more information in this listing since it is clearly outdated.",1309305600,5,681,4.246153846153846
1835636,5,B00008DDJ8,"I have many, many firm videos and dvds, but this is my favorite by far.  You get a total body workout, including abs, and I always get good and sweaty while doing it.  Stephanie is a good instructer, and is always explaining which muscle group is being worked.  I wore out my video version, and had to replace it with a new dvd.  I like the 40 minute length too, not too short, not to long. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!",1287273600,2,411,4.1645569620253164
1835637,4,B00008DDJ8,"I like using this video when I need to get back into weight lifting, it's a great total body moderate intensity video that mainly focuses on lifting combined with short bursts of cardio in between each session.",1285200000,,210,4.702702702702703
1835638,2,B00008DDJ8,"The new Firm tapes do not even approach the intensity and fun of the original Firm workouts. Did the company sell the brand name or something? I'm just starting to get back into shape after three years off with pregnancy/baby, during which time I didn't exercise at all. So I'm quite out of shape. Even so, this tape was not tough. Worse, it was boring. I ended up getting the old vintage Firm tapes, the ones with Janet Jones and Susan Harris -- finally available on DVD. Those are intense, full-body workouts that wear you out yet energize you at the same time.",1281830400,3,563,4.475728155339806
1835639,5,B00008DDJ8,"One of The Firms best overall toning work outs. With the addition of weights, your heart gets going too.",1278979200,,104,4.526315789473684
1835640,4,B00008DDJ8,"I know that I should probably work out more than 40-45 minutes a day given how sedentary the rest of my life is. But, really, I try to eat well and exercise everyday, and besides, my life is not my body. I am a nurse, not a movie star. So, having said all that, really, I like this workout. True it's not Cathe Freidrich or Jari Love, but damnit, I'm getting old,  and I don't always want all that stress.  Anyway, some days I just cannot face more than 40-45 minutes of working out in front of the television, and I can tell you that this little workout will leave you feeling pretty good. On days when I'm feeling hypermotivated, maybe I'll do Jillian Michaels Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism video (which rocks, by the way), but for those every day, oh crap I need to work out or the depression monster will get me needs, this is an outstanding workout (remember, you can always heavy up) that you can do quickly, and the rest of your day will be the better for it.",1274054400,6,963,4.256830601092896
1835641,5,B00008DDJ8,A sculpting workout that does what it says - works on major muscle goups without a lot of other fuss and bother.  The routine is solicly paced and quite vigorous if you use appropriately heavey weights. I'm very happy to add it to my workout schedule.,1270684800,2,251,4.456521739130435
1835642,2,B00008DDJ8,"The arm workout was entirely too easy and there is entirely too much stretching between sets.  All the stretching is annoying.  I definitely would NOT recommend this video to people seeking an intermediate or advanced workout, although it would probably be good for beginner.",1256774400,2,275,5.2272727272727275
1835643,4,B00008DDJ8,"I have had this DVD sitting around in my collection since I bought this on the infomercial along with the BSS2 Fanny Lifter Series. Now I will do my best to be fair here. For 40 minutes it's a good workout with weight training-only exercises. The last 10 minutes of the DVD is dedicated to Abs (some will hurt if you have low back problems like me) so 30 minutes is toning-only. Now with that said, I feel that Body Sculpt Blaster w/ Nancy Tucker is a much better workout and much more fun, although Stephanie is a great lead. The difference bwt this one and BSB is that this works upper and lower body separately instead of combining them w/Compound and Isolation movements. I felt my muscles working with this DVD, no doubt, but it just wasn't as much fun as BSB.

I have been down-graded to a high-beginner level due to many months off of exercise and I do think this one is rated appropriately for Intermediate-Advanced Exercisers. It can easily be made more advanced by adding more weights. True ""Advanced"" lifters will see this less challenging even with much heavier weights as only 1 set of each exercise is performed except push ups, those are 2. Lower body is tough! There is no true break or stretching in bwt the segments like with the upper body. My legs were toast and I used no weights...again due to being more beginner now. This is a workout that will produce results and will really build up your muscle endurance. You climb the tall box for 1 set, then do Leg press with the Tall box once. Otherwise a couple of lower body exercises are combined. Also, there is a warm-up for each section, annoying if you do all segments together as 1 warm up is only needed. There is also no DVD chaptering allowing to to pick one or two of the workouts instead, you do all 3 or fast forward to the workout you want.

I will continue to use this workout, but I will end up using BSB, Total Sculpt, Hi-Def, ect, more often. I want to get to the point of using 20-25 lbs for my heavy weights and doing that on the fanny lifter will make for a really ""lifted"" fanny. Would I buy this DVD again, yes...but I would buy other ones again first. I have gotten used to alternating upper and lower body as it gives the muscles and mind a break. SO bwt Cathe Friedrich and other Firm DVDs, I enjoy those more. It's a good, sweaty workout, but it just wasn't as fun as I would have hoped. Basically I made it though, had my body aching, but walked away unenthused or excited to do it again anytime soon. I have never felt that way about any DVD with Stephanie before. Body Sculpt Blaster is much better, just add abs to the end of that for a complete workout.",1254700800,,2651,4.321285140562249
1835644,4,B00008DDJ8,"The video met my expectatives, because it was hard enough to feel the workout and it used the fannylifter. It has three different sessions that can be done separately or alltogether. The upper body is really good and you can feel it, specially with the dumbells. The warming session of the lower body part is a little difficult to follow up for a begginner, because it includes different movements with little reps.  But the exercises for the lower body are really strong and do shape the legs. The abs part is short, but is intense.  I recommend it definitively for begginners.",1219795200,,578,4.712871287128713
1835645,4,B00008DDJ8,"I've been doing The Firm workouts since I was a teen. I like this one, it's not too intense but you still feel like you got a pretty good workout. Sometimes it's not enough of a workout for me so I mix it up with the Cardio Blast (also from The Firm). I like the instructor though. This would be good for someone who wants to get back into working out again.",1209513600,,358,3.986111111111111
1835666,4,B00008DDJ8,"I have been doing The Firm workouts for a couple of years now, rotating between the four DVD's that I purchased when I first started.  I really liked this DVD workout for strength training.  If you're looking for a cardio workout, this one won't have it.  The workout was easy to follow, and my muscles were sore the next day.  I also like how you can play the whole workout or play sections of it (Upper, Lower and Abs).",1205884800,,421,4.291139240506329
1835667,5,B00008DDJ8,"Out of all the Firm workouts, this is my favorite! This is a muscle sculpting program, working the upper body, the lower body and the abs.  Those looking to sculpt, tone and shape their muscles, this is it! Not for beginners, but perfect for intermediate to advanced. You need 3, 5, 8 lbs weights. I don't have 8 lbs weights, so I use my 5 lbs weights and it works just as well! I don't always have time to go to my muscle sculpting class at the gym and this workout is exactly what I was looking for.  The workout is just as good as muscle class at the gym, and I can experience it in the luxury of my own home! I wish I could find another workout like it.",1205366400,2,657,4.00763358778626
1835668,2,B00008DDJ8,"The steps/instructors are too difficult to follow.  I'll bet that I will burn calories trying to learn them though. LOL.  I ordered four different DVD's from the Firm.  Will try and try again, as I do believe in the philosophy of buildng muscles to burn more calories.",1203811200,,268,4.659574468085107
1835669,4,B00008DDJ8,"I am new to the Firm videos and this is the first one I bought.  I was looking for something to do in addition to my usual routine which is running.  I needed something that had strenth training with no cardio.  This fits the bill.  I like the instructor (not too perky or annoying).  I also like how this video is split into separate sections on the menu.  You can choose to do the entire workout or just upper, lower, or ab sections. If I only have time for arms then I can choose the arms section without having to fast forward through a whole video.  My only complaint is that I wish it was a little longer on the upper body section.",1200700800,3,637,4.130081300813008
1835670,4,B00008DDJ8,"I definitely like this workout, and I usually do upper body one day, and lower body the next. I combine this with tredmill running for the aerobic workout. I have to separate the two due to time restrictions. I usually run in the morning, and do one of these before dinner because the combination Firm videos I don't have time for.

This video is too easy though; it is much easier then the one by Jennifer Carmen on the combined 3 in 1 workout. Yet, is still is pretty good. It is way shorter than the Carmen workout, so if I am feeling lazy I do it and I have still worked out. I do it with slightly heavier weights to make up for the shortened time.

Buy this if you need a short, comprehensive toning workout. Especially if you are a busy person, or tend to be lazy about fitting workouts in (like me).",1192320000,,806,4.193548387096774
1835671,5,B00008DDJ8,"This workout is divided into three sections - Upper Body, Lower Body and Abs and the total combined time is 40 minutes.  The instructor, Stephanie Corley, does a great job of leading and cueing the workout.

Needed for the workout are three sets of weights and The Firm Fanny Lifter.

I would gauge this as medium in the intensity range of workouts.  All the muscle groups are hit if you do the entire workout.  I'm an intermediate exerciser and work up a sweat during the lower body workout.

This has become one of my favorite workouts, in part due to the relatively brief workout time for a fairly complete total body workout and because it's simple and enjoyable to follow.  I would recommend this as a beginner weight/sculpting workout for those new to The Firm because of the lack of complexity and the ability to make the workouts more or less intense by using whatever size weights is appropriate for your fitness level.",1190073600,,928,4.656441717791411
1835672,4,B00008DDJ8,"This is a great workout for anybody because if you don't have much time,
you can target the area you want.  This is also good because you can start with or without weights.",1188864000,,172,4.212121212121212
1835673,4,B00008DDJ8,"This won't get your heart rate going, at least until you get to the leg portion, but it is a good video if you want to work on weight lifting. Most of their videos pair weight training with aerobics. However some, like this one, is just weights. I like it. It is broken into segments....amrs, legs, arms and legs. I like to mix up aerobics with the weight lifting videos for better results. I love the Firm videos and the results I am getting.",1171065600,5,443,4.285714285714286
1835674,3,B00008DDJ8,"If you have any knee problems, skip this completely. We are talking about a knee intensive workout. Squats, lunges and lots of aerobic moves. This is definitely an intermediate workout with the weights. Beginners can do the exercises without the weights.

I think you really should have the equipment they recommend as I could not do part of the video without it. You will break a sweat while doing this workout. That is for sure. It is fast paced and the three segments seem to go by in no time at all.

You need three sets of weights - 3, 5 and 8lb dumbbells.

There are three workouts which do have enough of a warm-up and cool-down segment so you can do them individually when you don't have 40 minutes.

Workouts:

Upper Body

Lower Body

Ab Workout

1835675,5,B00008DDJ8,"Stephanie Hucklebee is great in this strenth-building workout. It is divided into sections, upper body, lower body, and abs. You can do them separately or do them all together. I like doing the entire 45 minutes for a total body workout. Interspersed is cardio to keep your heart-rate up and burn calories. This is a great workout for everyone. :-)",1167782400,7,348,4.816666666666666
1835706,4,B00008DDJ8,"The Firms ""Super Body Sculpt"" is a 40 mins, 3 parts workout which is broken up into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs.  Each segment has its own warmup and cool down. It can be performed one segment at a time, or all together for a complete total body workout.  The Upper Body flies by quickly with pushups, lat rows and french presses and biceps.  The Lower Body section focuses a little too much on Squats, and by the end of your last leg press exercise, there are more squats  that will make you want to scream ""Enough"".  I found the Abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches, and too much on obliques.  The stablization exercises are a great bonus to this DVD, and are my favourite.  Overall it is very well instructed.  You can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough, especcially during leg presses and squats.  I usually do all three segments to get the full benefits I need, and this DVD is great as a beginners tool to a firm body.",1152489600,3,962,4.329608938547486
1835707,4,B00008DDJ8,"I really love most of The Firm workouts, and this is no exception.  I usually alternate lower and upper on different days.  The lower body has lots of squats and lunges with no floor work, so I usually throw in the Hips, Thighs and Abs too.  I have really noticed a difference in just 1 month.  HOWEVER, the DVD quality is really poor, and I have noticed lots of postings complaining about the quality.  Amazon offered to either refund my money if I return them, or give me 20% of the purchase price.  I am just going to keep them and live through the defects (totally frustrating), but I wonder when they will do something about it.  I got the same poor quality with the Hips, Thighs and Abs, so I assume it is a vendor issue.",1128556800,,727,4.262773722627737
1835708,4,B00008DDJ8,"Ths is the first Firm video led by Stephanie, and I think she does a good job.  She is pleasant, encouraging and has an inspiring physique which I hope to have one day.  Stephanie is joined by 4 fellow Firm Master instructors including Libby who shows beginner modifications.  You will need a Fanny Lifter or step or stool and assorted dumbells.

This workout is split up into three parts, upper body, lower body and abs.  Each part is about 15 minutes, and it hits all the muscle groups well in a short amount of time.  In the upper body section there are pushups, one arm lat rows, double arm rows, bicep curls, hammer curls, french presses, tricep kickbacks, front & side deltoid raises and military presses.  In the lower body section you will do 2 sets of leg presses (16 reps each leg each set), lunges, a squat/reverse lunge combo using the step, and a few sets of squats, some with count variation or added steps.  Lastly there is a short ab routine.  Each section also contains it's own warmup and cooldown, so you are really short on  time you can choose to do just one of the segments.  I usually do  the upper and lower body sections together, others who do that might be annoyed by the lower body warmup, but I find it a lot of fun so it doesn't bother me.

I wouldn't call this workout easy, it really packs a punch in a short time.  I consider it one of the tougher Firms I own, but it isn't so difficult that you won't be able to finish it.  It is short but you definitely feel you have worked when it's over.  For those looking for short strength workouts, I highly recommend.",1110067200,7,1593,4.349152542372881
1835709,5,B00008DDJ8,"he Firm is just simply one of the best workouts for the money, and when you consider the price of joining a health club, it's downright cheap. Add to that visible results in 10 workouts (which I have seen) and it's worth twice the price. My only problem is, at 5 feet tall, the steps (when stacked) are hard, but I pull through. Over a month or two, you'll be glad you persevered. I hate cardio, so this one DVD has given me the results I desire without having to jump around. I break up my workout into three days so I stay motivated and don't give up - lower body one day, upper body the next, and then abs. By the time I've done one full three-day rotation, my entire body feels stronger. I've gone from a size 10 to a loose size 8, and my goal is to hit size 4 by summer. Starting so early in the year, it's gonna happen. If you've never tried any other Firm videos, this a good one to start with, hard enough (with additional weights) for a more fit trainer, and just simple enough to get a coach potato into the zone. And if you've got the courage, do what I did. Take out your digital camera (and a tripod, if you have one), take a picture of yourself from all sides (not sucking in the stomach), do The Firm, then take another photo in about 3 weeks. When you start to see the definition in your stomach, butt and thighs, that will keep you motivated more than any of these quotes! I stick my new ""after"" photos on my refrigerator once a month; I'm so proud!  For anyone who's said this is too easy, up your weights.  This is a workout you can almost NOT grow out of.  Ultimately, I think this is a fabulous workout for women who don't want to be bulky, but long and lean.",1107129600,31,1680,4.115853658536586
1835710,5,B00008DDJ8,"I've done this workout many times and I've come to really enjoy it.  It's broken into 3 sections: 1) warmup, upper body, stretch 2) warmup, lower body, stretch 3) warmup, abs, stretch.

Some people will do upper body, lower body, and abs on three separate days, so the individual warmup will benefit them.  But I like to do total body in one day, so I found the individual warmup for each section unnecessary.  I only do the first warmup.  I'll either fast forward the other two warmups or take that time to rest.

This workout is definitely not in The Firm tradition of compound exercises, i.e. squats into shoulder presses or lunges into bicep curls.  Each exercise is done isolated, which is my kind of strength training style.

The upper body section goes by quickly.  Pushups, lat rows, bent over rows, shoulder presses, side and front lateral raises, French presses, tricep kickbacks, bicep curls to end it.  The most unique exercise is the bicep curls done sitting on the fanny lifter.  You bring the dumbbell up halfway, not all the way up like the traditional bicep curl.  That was different and refreshing.

Lower body is tough - all those squats, lunges, and step-ups on the fanny lifter.  The squats and step-ups seemed endless because my thighs were so tired, but at least that means the workout was effective.

Abs are pretty good.  Crunches, obliques, bicycles, planks.

What I really like is how Stephanie tells you to either use light, medium, or heavy weights for each exercise.  ""Squat to get heavy weights.""  That's a great idea.  I like being guided in that way.

Stephanie as an instructor is soft-spoken and quiet.  She's not a dynamic instructor, but that doesn't mean she's dull.  She still cues well and says reasurring things like ""that's tough,"" which I find myself nodding in agreement.

Everyone wears purple tops and black bottoms.  When I first did this workout, I was disappointed by the boring music.  It wasn't exciting and rocking like I expect from a modern video.  It sounded more like background music.  But it's grown on me, and some of the exercises actually match the music, especially during the abs section.  The set is all white.  The floor is light colored hardwood or laminate flooring.  It is modern but unfortunately lacks character.  Not a big deal though.  As long as the workout is good, that's all that matters.

Overall, I really like this video.  I like the gym style of doing one exercise at a time and doing total body on one video tape.",1096588800,22,2494,4.734265734265734

Some people don't think you need the fanny lifter, I did try this workout and some of the Firms others without the fanny lifter and the results are not the same.  Especially doing the leg press, the lifter is needed.  The instructor is great, even paced and keeps you motivated to finish the workout.  The last segment is the ab segment and it is short, sweet, to the point and effective.  The other DVD of the Firms I would recommend is the Body Sculpt with Jennifer Carmen, that workout is 55 minutes and you definately feel it.",1078876800,5,686,4.3125

Each muscle group is worked to resistance and there is no time wasting dancing around!!!
I use this tape on my body sculpting days and alternate it with cardio and the newer body sculpt with abs.  I would do only this one on my sculpt days but you know that ""muscle confusion"" is important!
The entire body is worked, including abs.  Also, you can adjust this workout by increasing or decreasing your weights.",1070064000,8,813,4.3933333333333335
1835714,2,B00008DDJ8,"I am a lover of The Firm.  I have had fantastic results with their videos, but this one I find very disappointing.  I did not feel worked out afterward.  It is broken up into 3 sections working the upper body, lower body and abs separately.  It does not have the advantage of the other Firm videos that do more in less time by working the lower body along with the upper body.  After each section, I thought ""Is that it?!"" However, if you are really short on time or just beginning, this workout may be great for you.  It is extremely beginner friendly and can be easily used in 15 minute sections.  If you want a wonderfully intense workout and can exercise for a full hour, try ""The Firm Body Sculpting Basics"".  Another great one that takes only 45 minutes is ""The Firm Maximum Body Shaping"".",1064275200,17,795,4.397260273972603
1835715,3,B00008DDJ8,"If you are purchasing this item, you will either need to buy a ""Fanny Lifter"" or use your own step in the best way you can. I think you really should have the equipment they recommend as I could not do part of the video without it.

If you have any knee problems, skip this completely. We are talking about a knee intensive workout. Squats, lunges and lots of aerobic moves. This is definitely an intermediate workout with the weights. Beginners can do the exercises without the weights.

You will break a sweat while doing this workout. That is for sure. It is fast paced and the three segments seem to go by in no time at all.

You need three sets of weights - 3, 5 and 8lb dumbbells.

There are three workouts which do have enough of a warm-up and cool-down segment so you can do them individually when you don't have 40 minutes.

Workouts:

Upper Body
Lower Body
Ab Workout

Stephanie Corley leads this workout that has yes, not one, but five instructors.

7981709,5,B00008DDJ8,"I bought this video in the summer 2015 at a yard sale. Over the winter it stopped working so I bought this one from Amazon in March 2016. At 64 years I use this video at least three times a week to help me maintain my strength and help keep old age from doing me in. The pace and music work great for me. I've been working with TV shows or videos for since Jack Lalane. I added weights with Leslie Sansone's videos. This workout uses light, medium and heavy weights and is helpful for this period of my life and so far I'm able to keep up. In the beginning I stayed with the beginner suggestion but was able to advance over time and use.",1477094400,8,637,4.063492063492063
7981710,5,B00008DDJ8,"This is a great sculpting video.  It is broken down into three segments, upper body, lower body and abs.  It's my go to workout when I am short on time.  Each workout is around 15 minutes long. The upper body is done sitting on top of the 14"" Fanny Lifter, so when my knees aren't feeling good I appreciate that. The lower body workout utilized the 14"" step up Fanny Lifter for very beneficial lower body results and the abdominal section which is a little shorter is great too!
I have had this video on VHS and have used it for years.  I just purchased the DVD so I was sure to have it for a long time!
I highly recommend this workout.  No fancy moves, just good basic weight training!",1455840000,6,686,4.206106870229007

This one is not my favorite of hers but still alternate it with the others.  She is still the best for easy, precise instructions and a great workout.",1437436800,2,297,4.25
7981714,5,B00008DDJ8,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,3,1486,4.427007299270073
