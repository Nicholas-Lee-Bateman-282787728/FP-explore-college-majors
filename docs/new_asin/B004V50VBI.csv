4481854,4,B004V50VBI,It is a pleasure to watch this.  Any more info on Jesus always makes you feel excited inside.  I wish they would quote more of these other texts and not rely on the shroud (documentary) so much.  But I do enjoy it.  Think about the alternatives the media gives us on TV.  Buy this.  You will like this.,1365465600,4,302,4.120689655172414
4481855,1,B004V50VBI,"Why is it no matter what historical topic, the History Channel manages to do the worst job possible  on it?
The Founding fathers were drunkards and ALL evil doers . Dan Brown is a Saint and the Lost Gospel of Thomas,which was a gnostic text is believable. What astonishing idiocy. I would have liked to buy it  but I don't buy propaganda pieces. They spend an enormous amount of time on the Gnostic texts. The gnostic texts are the favorites of liberals who love it for its pagan flavor. The kingdom of god is in you. Many of those texts have the flavor of Clement of Alexandria, who blended Egyptian beliefs into the gospels and  who may have penned many of the gnostic texts. Poor job as usual History Channel. It is up to your usual low standards.",1364688000,3,750,4.420289855072464
4481856,5,B004V50VBI,This shroud contradicts reality as we know it and seems like a time capsule from Jesus to us in the present day. They did a great job presenting this miracle and putting a face to the man was a Blessing.,1360195200,,203,4.1
4481857,3,B004V50VBI,"Some theology is misguided. Too much time spent on Gnostic gospels, while interesting,  of course are NOT scripture.
I absolutely believe that The Shroud of Turin is indeed the burial cloth of Jesus.",1359849600,,199,5.03030303030303
4481858,5,B004V50VBI,"I always thought the New Testament had so many things missing and after all, men decided what should be put in and what to leave out. I want to buy this because I love that there are so many missing pieces to the story of the 40 days of Jesus. I am a person of Faith and Science and sometimes one out weighs the other....depending on what is going on in my life or what I am learning. This gives us an explanation for those who do not know or need a refreshing version of things that are missing and what happened to them.
We should never stop learning and I think this is a Brilliant DVD to buy for anyone! Especially Christians who go to church and only talk about ""rules"" in the Old Testament! Why do they call themselves Christians? I don't understand them and I think they stopped learning about Jesus and their churches are preaching about sin and not enough forgiveness.
I am getting off the DVD. Anyway, it is something like I haven't ever seen!!

You will not move from you screen!",1356220800,3,990,4.294117647058823
4481859,5,B004V50VBI,"I enjoyed this DVD from the History Channel so much I made it a Christmas gift for several people...keeping with the spirit of Christmas.  The quality was excellent...very realistic acting and authentic costuming and scenery, telling each story in a compelling style.  I not only felt I learned a lot but was truly inspired.",1322956800,2,324,4.981481481481482
8442943,1,B004V50VBI,"Pure bogus propaganda. It revolves around a guy with Trump hair recreating Jesus' physical self through the shroud of Turin - never mind they omitted fact that the shroud was carbon dated to the Middle Ages. They intersperse supporting quotes from some scholars, but leave out the unsupportive comments. For example, the film says Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. The Bible never says this. One Pope made it up and another Pope finally rebuked it. This is a film for people who want to validate their own erroneous beliefs. Once again, the History Channel bashes history. And about those cosmic aliens the History Channel says built the pyramids...",1486857600,,648,5.0092592592592595

8442948,5,B004V50VBI,"This full documentary is available on You Tube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz9cuRxN4Ug

History Channel is really deteriorating in matters relating to living up to its name. Neither this DVD nor ""The Real Face of Jesus"", a masterpiece documentary, are available anymore. Instead, to get a copy TRFoJ one has to look to preadatory retailers seeking to make 200& and more off what they paid for the History Channel's first offering of the DVD's.
But if you ever wondered if Jesus did exist these two videos should be enough to at least brush away doubt. I love these.
I was raised in a Christian family and fell away from the faith for years. Atheists and others, like Bart Ehrman in this video and who is an Atheist proselytizer might as well say, argue there isn't really any true evidence Jesus existed.
The Real Face of Jesus is intriguing enough to cast doubt on that proclamation hands down.

This is just the follow-up and is just as well done. The perfect gift, if you can ever find either or both DVD's, for anyone who studies religion, or is Christian.",1419206400,,1065,4.782608695652174
8442949,4,B004V50VBI,I enjoyed this examination of the re-appearance of Jesus after his crucifixion. But there is not alot there that is new.,1379376000,2,120,4.761904761904762

8442951,5,B004V50VBI,"It was a great learning tool.  I was amazed at what I didn't know. It restores faith in me.  One has to take the information and realize this is translation from over 2000 years ago.  Yet with the archaeologists and many other professionals, (most especially the computer artist) it was just plain fascinating.",1367539200,5,310,4.811320754716981
8442952,2,B004V50VBI,"This is more about the Shroud of Turin than it is the 40 days between resurrection and ascension. Every mention of events during the 40 days is then followed by how it relates to the Shroud. At least I won't have to buy a DVD about the Shroud now, if I develop an interest in it.",1367452800,,279,4.0
