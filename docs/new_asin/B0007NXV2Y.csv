8049357,4,B0007NXV2Y,"An interesting movie plot and Sophia was wonderful actress, however... her beauty is so great that it's hard to imagine how any woman so beautiful would wind up in a situation where men aren't worshiping at her feet and giving her the world.  From the moment she emerges from a container freight box as the flawless ""Birth of Venus"", it's hard to follow the story line.  Any Sophia Loren fan will love watching her every move and it's worth adding this film to your Sophia library.  Nature doesn't create a pearl like this woman very often.  This isn't a valid synopsis of the movie for if it had been any other actress I would not have puchased it.",1440806400,,649,4.47457627118644
8049358,3,B0007NXV2Y,"A celebrated cast (Peter Finch, Jack Hawkins, Sophia Loren) helps buoy this internationally produced potboiler, released by Paramount, 1966, centering around the search for a former Nazi general (Loren's ex) in hiding during Israel's struggle for independence in 1947-48, which too often gets mired in melodrama at the cost of escalating suspense. Part of the problem is that Loren has played her uber-suffering victim/heroine (most notably in de Sica's 'Two Women') to perfection so many times that it comes across here as a bit rote, despite her occasional bursts of vitality. Another problem is that the movie simply tries to be too much: a woman's-revenge/manhunt/action/war picture with a dash of politics and romance peppered in-- a tall order for any but the most focused of directors. 'Conflict' isn't a bad film by any means-- it's competently helmed by Daniel Mann ('Butterfield 8,' 'Come Back, Little Sheba') and well shot (in part by Nicolas Roeg)-- but it never quite manages to ignite a spark equal to its high-stakes subject matter. 3-plus stars.",1356652800,,1061,5.2105263157894735
