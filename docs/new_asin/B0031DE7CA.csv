8386899,5,B0031DE7CA,It has a live and a documentary. Included is a book with lyrics and a two sided poster. On one side is pictures of the members on the other is pictures and an interview with the members. Eventhough it is written in Japanese it is still a nice edition. The lyrics are also written in Japanese but the titles are in English. There are also small phraeses written in tiny words also in english. During the live they had fun joking around during the second half of the show. The documentary showed them at different concerts during the unclose tours. Also weaver did two songs for the opening act. I found it to be a nice set of entertainment.,1484265600,,639,4.378151260504202
