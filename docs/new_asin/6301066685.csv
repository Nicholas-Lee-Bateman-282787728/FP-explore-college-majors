310206,5,6301066685,"Dude this was a great flick, Again why is it not on DVD?
God only knows. It really is a catch your attention film with a lot of good acting & Action. Penelope Spheeris has done it again with ""Dudes"" and for those of you who have missed ""Suburbia"" a Cult Classic. Give it a look & check it out. This was filmed in LA ( California ) having been raised in So. Cal this is a typical LA film.
Kick back and Flash back when punk, Passion & Madness captured the Seventies & Eighties.",1349222400,,476,4.021052631578947
310207,5,6301066685,"While watching the Vandals' video for ""Urban Struggle"" on youtube I was wondering what movie clip they were using. I had recognized Jon Cryer (totally gnarly last name), but not the movie. Well after a little research I found it out that this was one of Penelope Spheeris's films. I had already seen The Decline of Western Civilization and Suburbia, so I wasn't gonna miss this one. I totally loved/love it, nothing bad in this movie, but that's to be expected. Three punk kids trying to make their way down to California, but run into some crazy-ass hicks (Lee Ving of Fear), who kill one of their friends; so Jon Cryer hunts 'em down for revenge. This is a must see if you're totally into Penelope Spheeris's films.

BUY IT!!!

310208,5,6301066685,"Very fun movie with an awesome cast...I can't believe this isn't on DVD yet, It's an 80's classic and a far better movie than some that are more well remembered.  I wore out a VHS tape back in the 90's, I really need a DVD!",1322697600,,223,3.9555555555555557
310209,4,6301066685,"Ok, let me get this out of the way... Fastforward through the first 10 minutes. That first ten minutes is what kept this movie from being a classic like the Rocky Horror Picture show, except you don't have to be stoned to enjoy it. They all almost fall to their deaths, the most memorable line is, ""Don't jump, you've got the car keys!"" and they decide to move to California.

Now, we're at minute 11, fasten your seatbelts, this movie is about kick some ass, too bad Flea had to die to give the moviea point, but so it goes.

What follows minute 11 is one of the great guy bonding movies of all time. I won't ruin it for you, but this is the movie for everyone who said the Big Leboski SUX!

I'm killing half a star because it's not available on DVD, and anothe half star because of the first ten minutes.",1299283200,,806,4.187096774193549
310210,5,6301066685,No problems from this seller. Got my movie on time to give to my sister for Christmas.,1243123200,,86,4.117647058823529
310211,3,6301066685,"First off, I must say that I think Penelope Spheeris is the worst plague ever unleashed on the punk world. That being said she did document some good music in Decline of Western Civilization, though a bit sensationalized. Her true life, grittyness is about as genuine as Andy Warhol's hair color and Pamela Anderson's boobs. Case in point, ""Suburbia"", an over the top, glorified look a punk rock squatters. Not real punks, but her own fairy tale version of punks.

Hence, the Penelope Spheeris direction can put you to sleep within 30 minutes. If you manage to stay awake you will find a film that had potential but was ruined by its director and one of its key actors, the overacting Flea (Red Hot Chilly Peppers).

But punk fans will appreciate Lee Ving's (Fear) parts as well as appearance by the Vandals. By a used copy for under $2 and you can't go wrong. Cheaper than a rental. Every punk should watch this once. Not twice. Just once!

For a fun punk related movie I would recommend ""Repo Man"" over this. Also ""Urgh! A Music War"" blows away ""Decline"" in genuinely caprturing the countercultural music movements of new wave and punk, though it does not embrace hardcore the way ""Decline"" does.",1093824000,3,1198,4.668246445497631
310212,5,6301066685,"Big city punk rock headbangers head southwest on a road trip for a change of scenery to spend the money one of them got in a personal injury lawsuit. While camping by the roadside the guy with the broken arm gets murdered by a gang of psycho rednecks who prey on Mexican migrants. When the cops won't do anything for them, they take the matters into their own hands pursuing the bad guys through throngs of moronic tourists, rodeos and ghost towns with the help of the mysterious cowboy chick who happens to be a transplanted big city divourcee. Shot on location in Wyoming the film is refreshing for its satire as well as its genuine-looking scenery from the skull numbing punk club in the big city to the guy getting gored by the bull during the rodeo. One of the best little films to come out of the eighties.",995846400,11,812,4.42
