7795131,5,0982999305,"""The Moon and the Son,""  John Canemkaer's beautifully-crafted, Oscar-winning animated reflection on his sometimes complex relationship with his Italian father, is a little gem of cinematic autobiography.  Through the power of traditional, hand-drawn animation and thoughtfully composed voice-over narration, John explores this deeply personal subject with a level of truth and honesty that are unique to this marvelous medium.  What would be impossible to convey in live action footage and photo-montage is brought to vivid life through John's highly expressive drawings and paintings.  This film is essential viewing for anyone interested in animation, the Italian-American immigrant experience, and sincere autobiographical film.",1327276800,,731,6.207920792079208
