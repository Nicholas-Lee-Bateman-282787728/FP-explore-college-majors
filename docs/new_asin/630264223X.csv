490700,5,630264223X,"I agree with everyone of the previous reviews.  I too saw this film when I was very young, (only 11 years old) but I never forgot it.  I've seen it  several times since and it becomes more beautiful and important as I grow  older.  I've never been driven to search the web and the local movie stores  for anything like I have in my frustrating search to aquire this film.  Why  is it I can find millions of copies of Judge Dread or The Beastmaster yet a  film with such importants is allowed to virtually disappear?  I've never  seen scenery such as this before, or more noble truths displayed on film.  Please Disney, put the mainstream insignificant eye-candy movies to rest,  and allow all the people I know who have never even heard of this movie to  view it's inspiring, intelligent and unforgettable story.  Many of us will  be waiting.",942710400,50,842,4.513333333333334
490701,5,630264223X,"The story is outstanding, the cinematography awe-inspiring, like the previous reviewers, I love this. At least I have a VHS copy to watch until  the DVD version comes out.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, you'll  love it, it will take you down a strange path, of the sort that happens  when a human being leaves our powerful civilization and enters the great  unknown, and must find a niche within Mother Nature's grand creation.",940636800,3,432,4.72
490702,5,630264223X,"I too was disappointed this video was not available. I don't buy very many videos, as it seems most are about as meaningful as yesterday's newspaper.  However, this is one of the few films that transcends the celluloid to not  only craft a fine story but illustrate the complexities of modern man's  place in nature.",939859200,2,316,4.709090909090909
490703,5,630264223X,"This is so much more than just a fine ""Nature"" film. And It's true! This is a genuinely profound film that astonishes with it's sweep,  grandeur and quiet grace, as well as the truth, clarity and warmth of it's  story of personal revelation, and its somewhat troubling vision of Man's  place in nature. The fact this film is unavailable in video format at this  time (Fall, '99) is unconscionable! Make no mistake about it--This film is,  in its own way, a true Classic. Find it if you can!!",939427200,4,491,4.534090909090909

490759,5,630264223X,"This is one of my all-time favorite Disney films. The wolf is and has played a key role in sustaining a healthy ecosystem long before any Europeans landed in North America. But the wolves purpose in nature was cut short by poachers and bounty hunters that made a profit off the hides they sold. Along with the decline and decimation of the wolf species came an imbalance of the ecosystem. In trying to give humans a better understanding of these animals our research and studies show that wolves are paramount in keeping the environment in check. This film was not only a great story in the tradition of Disney but also a film that was very instrumental in bringing awareness to the public of the wolf population and the evidence to support it.

If you're a lover of nature and it's splendor then I highly recommend this film for your entertainment. Some of best cinematography shot in the arctic north.",1513728000,,903,4.64375

491112,5,630264223X,"When I first saw this movie, I took my four year old son and two of his friends to the theater.  The three boys watched hiding on their knees behind the chair in front of them, scared of seeing wolves.  At the beginning they all were very frightened and apprehensive.  As the story progressed, they got very involved-- laughing and enjoying the story so much that all three boys slowly rose from the floor to sit in their chairs.  At the end of the film all three boys were sobbing about the ending.

For years as a third grade teacher as part of my science curriculum, I rented the movie (for probably ten+ years) to show my classes how animals live, eat, raise families, and are adapted to their environment.  Finally, the stores no longer had the video and I really felt thatI had lost an extremely effective part of my science program.

For years I searched unsuccessfully to find and  purchase the video NEVER CRY WOLF.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon recently.  Immediately I bought it.  It has been over 15 years since I retired from teaching, but it is still a very special movie.

I love wolves.  Today I teach about wolves at a state park. After years of researching canine, wolves are still my favorite.  I really love this movie.",1457654400,15,1246,4.45575221238938

I often do not buy DVDs online as 8 out of 10 times I have received inferior products that do not work. I bought this one because I could not find it anywhere else and I adored the book. The one star was left off because the movie itself was a disappointment. It only briefly touched on things in the book, did not mention the government mishandeling of the situation and even the brief glimpses from the book were re-arranged and unrecognizable. If Mr Mowat had much to do with the making of the movie I am not sure why to drastic change. READ THE BOOK",1449187200,,693,4.297709923664122

With very little dialogue, just some gentle voice over, we trace his path with humor, tension, and sadness.  Even the ending is surprisingly quiet and gentle for a Hollywood film.  An honest portrait of the complexities of venturing beyond our limits.

Sadly there's never been a home video release that really captures how beautifully shot this film is.  The DVD is OK at best, but made from a beat up print.  This cries out for a blu-ray re-mastering, as Criterion did recently or Carroll Ballard's other nature based masterwork, ""The Black Stallion"".

491772,5,630264223X,"NEVER CRY WOLF concerns a naturalist (Charles Martin Smith), employed by the U.S. government, sent on a mission to assess the influence of wolves on the declining herds of caribou in the northern reaches of Canada and Alaska.  Smith takes a train to a remote town, and is further transported to his base, located on the edge of a large frozen lake, by way of a small airplane.  The airplane is piloted by Brian Dennehy.  Smith spends a year engaging in studying wolves at close range, and eventually encounters a herd of caribou, where he witnesses wolves attacking the herd.  Two Native Americans provide company to Smith, and the three engage in low level philosophizing for a significant part of the time spent in this motion picture.  These are an old man (Zachary Ittimangnaq) and a young man (Samson Jorah).  The older man's mission in this movie is to live his entire life in the remote wilderness, while the young man decides to return to civilization, but to engage in occasional hunting in the wilderness.  The script is peppered with subtle comedy, but ultimately, the film ends on a note of great sadness.  At the end, Smith decides to not return, and to remain in the wilderness as a hermit, exposed to the elements (and likely to die of starvation, sickness, and/or exposure to the elements).

There are many reasons to like this film, and only one reason to dislike this film.  The only reason to dislike this film is Smith's decision at the end, to remain in the wilderness.  Why would any person voluntarily decide to be a hermit, in one of less hospitable regions of the globe?  I DON'T KNOW!!!  Here are the reasons to like the film:

(1) GREAT SCENERY.  As a devoted hiker and amateur photographer, spending hundreds of weekends at Point Reyes, Glacier Natl'l. Park, Joshua Tree Nat'l. Park, Death Valley Nat'l. Park, Armstrong Woods State Park, Point Lobos, Crater Lake Nat'l. Park, Mt. Rainier Nat'l. Park, Congaree Nat'l. Park, Four Holes Swamp, Arches Nat'l. Park, Canyonlands National Park, Natural Bridges National Monument, and so on, it was easy for me to become addicted to this movie.  The cinematography of the distant mountains and lakes is perfect.  Also, the cinematography in the close-up views of boulders, alpine meadows, grasses, lichens, and such, is also perfect.

(2) SCIENCE.  Much of the film is devoted to the techniques of the naturalist, for example, the examination of scat from animals, to determine their diet, the behavior of animals in using their urine to mark their territory, and the parental instincts of wolves towards their young.  Although my own experience is in biochemistry and molecular biology (and not animal ecology), the scientific aspects of this movie were more than enough to capture my interest.

(3) COMEDY.  This film will not stimulate any belly-laughs, however, the subtle humor of many scenes is worth noting.  The incompetence that so characterizes some aspects of government planning is a target.  Smith unloads crates of supplies on the frozen lake.  These supplies, provided by his supervisors, include requisition forms for ordering supplies (of course, these have no use in the wilderness), a crate of light bulbs (these also cannot be used without electricity), and a crates of food that consist only of asparagus.  Yet another source of comedy, is the pilot, played by Brian Dennehy.  His airplane is a rattle-trap affair, looking like it was scrounged from the scrap heap.  A rubber spider dangles from above the windshield.  Mr. Dennehy acts like a crazy-man, and engages in a good-natured rant about residents in suburbia being bored to death.  Another source of humor occurs when Mr. Smith first arrives in town, from his train trip.  A resident of the town stands in the snow, playing a goofy tune on a saxophone.  Yet another source of comedy occurs when Dennehy decides to reduce the weight in his little airplane, and tosses a large wooden crate off the plane (the crate has large printing on it reading, TOILET PAPER.

(4) SPIRITUALISM.  Perhaps the most engaging aspect of this movie, is its spiritualistic aspects.  For example, when Mr. Smith is dropped off on the frozen lake, he suddenly realizes that he has no way to efficiently transport his supplies to the banks of the lake.  Conveniently, Zachary Ittimangnaq drives by on his dog sled, hoists Smith into the sled, and transports him and his supplies to the banks of the lake, and builds him a shelter.  This is a lesson on being a good samaritan.  Devotion to science, is disclosed, when Mr. Smith decides to engage in a nutrition experiment by dining only on mice for (apparently) several months, in order to demonstrate that wolves can survive on mice, and do not need to eat caribou.  Thus, at least in my opinion, this aspect of the film conveys another spiritualistic aspect of humanity, namely, the common tactic of scientists to ""think out of the box.""  (Of course, people in other professions also sometimes think out of the box.)  Another spiritualistic aspect of this film, is its gentle advocacy of low-impact living.  The film seems to advocate, at least indirectly, the low impact life style of Native Americans who have not yet been exposed and tainted by European civilization.  (Now, whether low impact living is viable as a life style, is another issue.  The fact remains, is that this is one particular spiritualistic aspect of the movie.). The film's gentle advocacy of low impact style can also be interpreted as an advocacy of: (1) Ensuring that one is adequately prepared for accomplishing any particular task or goal, being self-sufficient, and not having to rely on other people as a safety net; (2) Individualism and the willingness to accept responsibility for one's own actions.  The film's spiritualistic aspects are enhanced by composer Mark Isham's plaintiff melodies for synthesizer and woodwinds.",1398643200,7,5881,4.956122448979592

Get it!,1394582400,,317,4.25
491797,4,630264223X,"Great film with very little dialogue and only a few, well performed roles with incredible scenery throughout. Although it has a documentary feel to it, it is a ""docudrama"" at best, so the level of biological accuracy and overall ""realness"" of the film (which may take some liberties here and there) is irrelevant to me. What I find amazing is how the story line was tied together with the filming of the wolves in their natural state....especially the later scenes involving the wolves, the caribou and a naked Charles Martin Smith...although there's many close cropped, fleeting shots, it's very impressive and must have been outrageously difficult!

I also, several years ago, bought the book (non-fiction, by the way!) that the film was based upon, and wasn't disappointed with that, either - even though the producers of the film took some differing ""tracks"" with the story line within the book - it still came out a superb film!! Brian Dennehey and Charles Martin Smith have always been superb actors, and while Charles Martin Smith was the main star of the film, Brian Dennehey truly ""stole the show"" with his performances as ""Rosey the bush pilot"".

The story has several holes; How could this guy get sent to the arctic in the middle of winter, completely unprepared? Is just one hole but the closeness to wolfs behaving naturally makes up for it. The respectful inclusion of the Inuit people was very appropriate. The dichotomy of the young mans need to kill wolves is likely a real world issue.

It's an unusual film in that it explores man's relationship(s) not just with each other, but with the animals we share the earth with.  This is done in a pleasant manner without the 'documentary' aspect, i.e. it has tragedy, humor, tension, redemption.  And this is on top of superb scenery.

This evening my lady and I both viewed it. We had just watched ""Happy People: A Year in the Taiga"" and it brought me looking for this film, for reasons I suppose I understand now.
It's a fact that I was too young to appreciate this film on some levels, but the fact that it stayed with me is a testament to something else. Needless to say, all these years later, and even 11 years after your review, I am sitting in our home stunned, moved, completely restless and completely at peace. This film has suddenly and unexpectedly entered my present adult world, and vaulted itself to one of my favourite films of all time.
This is a masterpiece of a motion picture, and I intend to urge as many people as I can who only vaguely remember it as I did to revisit it, and to make sure it receives an introduction with those who've never thought to even consider watching it.

The transcendent crime, of course, is the inferior transfer we have to live with. If it were released on Blu-ray tomorrow I'd buy it again in a heartbeat; this deserves to have its photography viewed, and its soundtrack heard, as uncompressed as is currently available.

And let's be clear: this movie isn't about environmentalism or ""progress"" versus nature, or any other narrow-minded this-v.-that conflict. It's about, as the film itself says, what one will do to survive. What's worth possessing, and what's worth protecting? It's our consistent failure to answer that correctly that has everything to do with the state in which we find ourselves.

Since then I have seen it possibly 7 or 8 times (most recently about 4 months ago, rented for free from my local library). There is no other word to describe it but ""masterpiece""! It's unlikely anyone would find a flaw in this film. What makes NCW most special is the message is as valid now as it was 30 years ago. It can be watched -and enjoyed - by anyone, young and old. No special effects, stunts or trickery. Just wonderful storytelling. Words, cinematography, acting, editing and direction come together to form that rare and - dare I say it -perfect whole. NCW is a memorable experience I cannot forget. I'm buying the DVD (at $5 its a steal). Hopefully a bluray version will come out someday.

The only question in my mind is: Why is one of the greatest movies ever made ""lost"" in time? It's never been re-released (as far as I know) to the theatre. And (as far as I know) has never been released to cable or network television. Why??????? I just don't get it.

I would also like to add that my review was inspired by a sincere appreciation of NCW reviews here. For years, I have all but begged every movie-watcher I have come in contact with to see this film.

492199,5,630264223X,"It always surprises me that so few people know this film, and so it's wonderful to see by the other comments here that other people love this movie as much as I do.  I first saw it as a teen or pre-teen about the time it came out and was stunned by it.  I think it was the cinematography that hit me first, the snowflakes melting on the windows of the train as Tyler travels north, and the way the camera took in the landscape in long, still shots like an Ansel Adams photograph. I remember thinking, ""I bet the cinematographer is Japanese"".  I have no idea where that conviction came from, but I felt like the patience reflected in the long takes and the appreciation of nature evident in every shot was like the desciptions I had heard of Japanese art, like the craft of bonsai.

I also love dogs...always have...and so a film about studying their cousins the wolves was naturally appealing.  Still, wolves and beautiful scenery does not a compelling movie make.  There's so much here that is wonderful, but among the best of it is the intimacy and discovery that plays out, in a measured pace, from start to finish of the movie. So much of what we see in movies is the driving of archtypal characters (the action hero, the high school kid looking for love) through plots that we have seen a hundred times (thwarting the evil genius, getting the girl), that it's wonderful to watch a movie where we have no idea where the protagonist is going, and the progress of the plot is taking place in his own head or in the slow build of his relationship with the wolves and the Inuit men he meets.

Anyway, now that I know there's a lot of us fans of NCW out there, I feel like we should form a fan club and start a letter-writing campaign to get Disney to release a high-def version of the movie from an original print, bundled with the ""Making of..."" movie.

Excellent cast - The main character, a overwhelmed academic that finds himself in the middle of his most feared situation.

""How do you beat boredom, Tyler? ... Adventure!"". That may be one of my favorite movie quotes. I am sure a lot people wish they had the nerve to accept this type of challenge and understand the self-awareness it would reveal.

Awesome.

This movie surprised me.  I found a reference to it in a book on Eskimos and Film and decided to try it out.  The photography was sensational, the wolf scenes are very believable, and the transformation of a person lacking wilderness experience into someone capable of surviving on his own is honest.

This is nearly a documentary, so why would you expect it to have the same lame plot as all the fictional movies out there?  This movie is great - there is beautiful scenery, you learn about the lives of the creatures of the arctic, human and non-human, and such a sense of perspective, of actually being alive just a little bit!  Some people do not like it because it is ""vulgar"" for having a nude man running through the wild.  I'm not a fan of nudity in movies, but in this case I think it really does add to the movie.  It's not like he's having sex with someone or pushing up his junk in a slutty dress for a few dollars.  He is casting off the constraints and protection of man and being completely vulnerable in nature.  I think it is such a beautiful movie.

In the end we see people which we knew from the start and middle of the movie showing their true identities. No they are not spies or anything. But they were hunting easy money. Living an easy life. Yes, they killed animals. I put myself on their place and with a very big pride(I'm not from rich family myself, therefore I know my limits) I will say that I would not do such a thing.

They've been taken away, killed or kept in captivity. Abuse and misuse. So I still question myself: ''Why can't nature be left alone? We are the dominant species and we destroy everything in our way.'' To know the movie you must not read all of the reviews. I did read many because I could not understand whether it would be any good. But it is. It must be among other movies. This is a must. A classic and masterpiece. You have to have it!

Her research on wolves is accurate. Superbly acted by Charles Martin Smith and all of the few actors in this film, the real stars are the wolves. I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates nature and wildlife, as well as, those who don't -- like Sarah Palin! She might learn some respect for God's creation and our human role as protectors and preserveres of it.

Never Cry Wolf is the story of a biologist who is sent to Artic terrain to study the habits of wild wolves. During the main character's scientific research, he realizes the truth about the vital role the wolf plays in the balance of this natural environment. Through his meeting with an indiginous Elder and his family, he receives a different perspective of Nature and of It's wildlife, which is threatened by our modern industrial technological complex. When he delves into his work with integrity, the wolf becomes his wayshower in a journey of self-transformation. The story evolves with little dialogue, deep drama, and stunning visual beauty!

492338,5,630264223X,"This is a lovely film. That is proven by the fact that it must be 20 years ago that I watched it, only once, and I still remember some of it quite clearly. I was reminded of it by an amazon friend's review of a mouse trap; the review included rodent cooking recipes.
Why 'spoiler'? Well, some people's appetite may be spoiled by the idea of eating mice.
Also, the idea of mouse consumption is one of the highlights and lessons of the film. So I am reducing the suspense here.

The hero, a zoologist, is dispatched to the far north of Canada to research the effect of wolves on the caribou population. He finds out that wolves actually live on mice. In order to prove the possibility that a large mammal can live on mice, he does it himself for several weeks. We watch him preparing mouse stew, mouse satay, and so on. His access to spices is naturally limited, so one can imagine a far larger range of dishes with proper shopping opportunities.

Another situation that stuck to my memory was related to translation, one of my permanent subjects of interest. We see our hero in the process of preparing his lunch, when a group of local people (what am I expected to call them?) walks by. They start investigating what the white man is doing. One of them translates. The leader of the group, something of a venerable chieftain, embarks on a long monologue. The zoologist asks: what does he say? The translator says: he says, good idea.

Especially those that love wilderness or specifically Alaskan type wilderness stories.  Remniscent of Jack Londons books, but with a more modern storyline.  With the price at Amazon, you just can't go wrong.  And their service is incredibly quick.  Don't even bother with ---Bay, Amazon.com is the way to go.  I will now get all my movies through them!  Tulpan is a great foreign film.  Filmed by a Russian filmaker, set in the Tibetan Steppes, this movie is another great film.  Snow Walker is a film to be seen.  Set in the 1950's, another adventure set in the Alaskan wilderness.  Filmed by the same filmaker as Never Cry Wolf, I believe????
Farley Mowat???  Anyway, a plane crashes and the pilot finds his true self with a native American girl he crashes with (his plane).  Another modern western is Tom Berenger in ""Last of the Dogmen"".  A little sappy perhaps, but a neat little story.  Sorry to digress from the original subject, ""Never Cry Wolf"".  Great little movie, great price.  Check it out for the family or for yourself and significant other.  I believe most if not all of these films are available on Amazon.com at great prices and excellent service.

492346,5,630264223X,"Charles Martin Smith was always typecast as the nerd/geek.  Well, here's a starring role for the type, and Smith brings it off to perfection.  As a scientist out to study wolves, not master nature, Smith develops his character from clumsy academic to man of the wilderness thanks to the imperative of sheer survival.  He plays an everyman, not heroic, but fortified with the will to survive and also, midst the dire challenges, the enduring curiosity which marks the human species.  He's half-starved, half-frozen, but he stops to stare at the wolves in wonder.  As he sets about surviving he also sets about getting to known these creatures, and they him.

Director Carroll Ballard, whose few works have been of high quality (this one, Black Stallion, Fly Away Home, Duma), specializes in stories about humans' relationship with animals, in an understated and believable way, avoiding the pitfalls of cuteness that plague the genre.  Which makes this one all the more remarkable, since it comes from Disney, who have made cuteness into an industry (and of whose acting stable Smith was a member).

The son of famed cinematographer Lucien Ballard, Carroll Ballard marks his work with stunning visuals.  So, not only is there a well-played adult story of survival here, but a movie so beautiful, that it cries out for a Blue-Ray version.",1237593600,2,1336,5.009049773755656

492394,5,630264223X,"Most everyone I know who's seen this film remembers a particular scene: it's a wonderful sequence in which the half-inspired, half-delirious naturalist and writer Farley Mowat (that's his name in real life; he's called ""Tyler"" in the film), isolated for months hundreds of miles from any hint of civilization in a remote Canadian mountain valley and driven a bit mad by his loneliness, dashes back and forth naked in the midst of a stampeding caribou herd, running with them pink and unclothed among the huge furry bodies who are barely aware of him, all veering across the greening tundra. Life is returning after the seeming death-watch of a near-arctic winter, and Mowat dances with Caribou.

There are few moments in film more richly imagined and simply done, few scenes more mad and extraordinary and beautiful than this erratic sprint and the simple, sparse, occasional drum bursts of cymbal and percussion that accent the silence and loneliness of that valley. The cinematography is vast and yet personal;  the sound track runs with him and punctuates the unlikely and astounding drama of that isolated moment. The reality must have been something like the movie scene, and that's not easy to do.

I'll leave to others reviewers to explain for you exactly why Mowat does his ""Naturalists Gone Wild"" take -- and it does make wonderful sense in the context of the unfolding story!

I'll share only this: be ready for several of the kind of small, granular, slightly startling scenes that define fine cinema. As a young, single man in 1983, I chose to take the most beautiful and intelligent woman I knew to see this newly-released movie, chose this above all others to share on our first date, precisely because I knew that the ""Caribou run"" scene would move her deeply (it did, to my joy that night). But the really important part was that I was permanently moved: I rejoiced in the occasional memories of that dash-with-the-Caribou for two decades, 'til one night a few months ago when I was lucky enough to see it replayed on cable and I rediscovered the reality; and it was just as brilliantly photographed, as magical, and as exhilarating as I'd remembered from first viewing.

There are other scenes that rush to your memory and immediately carve a hole for themselves: the meal-with-mice, a few intimate conversations with his occasional inuit companion; so many more. And the ending, which is played out brilliantly by Brian Denehy (the red-neck bush pilot of a relief plane, come to get Tyler and take him back to civilization) and Charles Martin Smith (who plays Tyler).

Indulge yourself in this film sweet nougat -- and it will repay you with sights and emotions well beyond what this much-neglected movie's so-so contemporary ""reviews"" might have led you to expect. And, Disney, you have a brilliant-cut gem, here -- get it a new mounting, prepare new DVD's from a new print with all of the scenes! -- hell, re-release it into theaters! What a fine film you made, and what a silly decision to look right past it for these 25 years since.

One last (obvious) suggestion: buy it or download it in the highest definition you can possibly get. You want to be in that valley, not just see it.",1206230400,2,3205,4.816363636363636

The cinematography was well done...like the scene of the ancient Eskimo woman in the firelight, the running of the ""wolves"" on the lake when he first arrives, the blowing of the papers in the wind, the view from the train window with the melting snow on the glass. I think it is a visually stunning film at times, especially if you like the great white north. The footage of wolves is well done. The bit with the oboe playing with the wolves howling is, in my opinion, hauntingly beautiful. The acting seems authentic by all and Charles Martin Smith will be endeared for this film...way to go chuck...and the only downside:I always kinda cringe at seeing the main actor's butt...like, whooooh...didn't see that coming...daggone, cover that thing up...but i see the visceral point the director is trying to make on the caribou hunt....and who hasn't at some time stood naked in the snow warming their wet bum by the fire?

One doesn't fall through the ice into freezing waters and sink down 15 feet with heavy clothing and a huge parka and usually make it out alive.  Totally unrealistic and did nothing to better this movie.  Plus, all the gear and crap they had and the mice eating thing...just stupid and ridiculous.  Some of the interactions between the Eskimo people were OK, but most were not well done.  For example, the scene at the very end when Farley is trying to teach the old Eskimo how to juggle was not good.  It ruined the end.  The director should have just had them walking off into the Tundra.  This alone would have made the movie better. The running around naked with the caribou...I mean, come on, the crazy airplane scenes at the beginning and all...just over the top and a total distraction.  I think almost every scene in the movie had some goofy unrealistic part in it.  What I'm trying to say is that the imagery in the movie is the real star here...the wilderness itself.

Every scene in this film seems so completely and almost perfectly composed.  Each shot would, in the art galleries of the world, be an independent work of beautiful composition.  Carroll doesn't just pick great locales, he weaves a work of filmic locations that imbues a sense of what the main characters in the story see. Once you view this film you see the gift that Ballard possesses and you will see it again and again in his other films; The Black Stallion, Fly Away Home, Wind (a cheesy script, but Ballard makes the visual exciting) and his last, Duma, a film ignored by the studios but a masterpiece, nonetheless, for its combination of gorgeous images of animals and kids involved in natural, conflicted, situations.

I have read the book that it is based on and the film is better. The book is nothing to laugh at and is a great work itself. The film simply takes the intimate essence of the book and distills it down to a very warm and introverted narrative. There is no overt antagonist in this film. Sure Rosie can be seen as such but in leu of 999.9% of films with a clear cut problem and conflict this film has nothing of the sort. The lack of overt conflict, sex, desire, and material motivation present in other films makes this stand out. My Neighbor Totoro, and The Cup are the only other films that come to mind that seem to posses the same base sensibilities. Still, they are not even close to the power this film has over me.

I can watch this film again and again, day after day and still I never tire of it. I do not view it as a docu-film, even if that is how it was intended or filmed. I view it as a simple story which climbs inside the head of the main character and brings the viewer along. I feel as if I am right there, time after time.

492485,5,630264223X,"This is a wonderful movie based on the real-life experiences of a field biologist.  He is sent to prove the belief of his superiors that wolves are responsible for the decline of the carribou population.  He discovers that the wolves really strengthen the herd by killing the sick and the weak, while it is a different kind of predator that is the bigger threat to the carribou, and the wolves for that matter.

This movie makes its point in a way that does not come across as manipulative, but merely presents the facts and let's you come to the conclusion.  It also does not come across as taking itself too seriously -- there are some very funny scenes in the movie.  One is his checking his rations, finding plenty of cans without a can-opener.  Another involves him trying to quietly set up his camp, to discover a wolf watching him.  The next scene has him making no effort whatsoever to be quiet.

The strength of this movie is the characters.  There are only eight actors (human; I'm not counting wolves, carribou or mouse actors -- yes, this is a Disney movie, but none of the mice look like Mickey).  This allows for greater development of the protagonist, Tyler (Charles Martin Smith).  The other main characters include pilot Rosie (superbly played by one of my favorite actors, Brian Dennehy), traditional Eskimo Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), and his more modern son Mike (Samson Jorah).

This 1983 movie was rated PG; if it came out a year later, it may have probably earned a ""13"" after it, or maybe not.  I would not recommend this movie for young children; the scene of Tyler marking off his territory, of his experimenting living on a diet of mice, and a scene of rear nudity may not be appropriate.  However, I would highly recommend parents accompanying children who are in, say, 3rd grade or so.  This movie can promote some good educational discussions.

This movie was entertaining, but I also learned things.  It changed my thinking on some ways, and it did it without beating me over the head with a proposed agenda.",1166313600,,2040,4.685393258426966

Never Cry Wolf is a dramatization of the expierences of naturalist Farley Mowat who investigate why wolves were killing arctic caribou herds in the Artic Wildeness of Northern Canada

Disney was always great for true life nature films...and this one is no exception. With gived direction from noted filmmaker Carroll Ballard, this film is artist poetry on film. You can breathe the cool mountain air . The filmmaker's eyes of what you see  are breathtaking views.

As I stated before, this is a dramazation, so Mowat's character is named Tyler (played careful by Charles Martin Smith-who you may have seen as Toad in the film American Graffitti). You see the wonderment and the adventure thru his eyes...and believe every frame this film shows. Brian Dennehy has a small role as a bush pilot/hunter. However, this is Smith's film..well Smith's and mother nature bounty itself.

This film is from 1983, but it does not date itself and worth every cent to get this movie. It is worth it to view such a visual treat for the eyes. With all the kiddy garbage out there lately, even from Disney itself, this treat from the past is something you may want

 One can only wish they would do an update now..showing Tyler's world 20 years later-one would hope with the wolves

492487,5,630264223X,"The caribou population is declining at an alarming rate and the Canadian government is concerned.  After a harrowing and kind of funny plane flight with tundra pilot Brian Dennehy government researcher Tyler is dropped in the frozen middle of nowhere.  It's a `kind of' funny plane flight because it's so well done.  Dennehy is a hung over, buckaroo bonzai type independent flyer.  His little prop plane, heavily laden with Tyler's (Charles Martin Smith) equipment, has a tough time both taking off and, later, staying afloat.  The in-flight repairs Dennehy makes had me on the edge of my seat - although the photography is the great strength of NEVER CRY WOLF, the acting - especially by Smith - and the editing are also nearly perfect. As harrowing as the plane ride is it's a pretty safe bet the plane will land (elsewise there'd be no movie) and Tyler will find survival, rather than research, is the pressing order of business.

 Tyler is there to locate a wild wolf pack, kill one or two of the pack members, and dissect them to discover if, as suspected, their stomachs contain an inordinate amount of healthy caribou meat.  Tyler, laden with crates of light bulbs and toilet paper, is materially and constitutionally unprepared for setting up a research station on his own.  Fortunately for him he'll be discovered, rescued, and befriended by two Inuits - the ancient Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq) and his adopted son, Mike (Samson Jonah.)  As Tyler notes in his voice-over narration, there are no orphans among the Inuit.  Ootek and Mike will arrive and disappear a few times, a wolf pack will be found, and Tyler will learn that man's relationship to the wolf is many times more complex than he imagined.

 I dislike most message movies.  They tend to distort characters and events, and beat you over the head until you accept their point of view.  NEVER CRY WOLF has a strong message about man and nature, but it's such an entertaining movie I didn't feel like I needed to join the Sierra Club to enjoy it.  The story lines are clear, and after the plane trip its plentiful humor is quiet and unforced.  Smith, who spends an awful lot of the movie alone, acting under his voice-over narration, is nuanced and convincing. Jorah and, especially, Ittimangnaq, are both good and both add a layer of authenticity to the film. And the photography is at times breathtaking.

492488,5,630264223X,"One of the most beautiful and sympathetic movies ever made about wolves, Alaska, and the Inuit, I could watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it. A mid-level analyst who just happens to be in the right place at the right time (he has his doubts early on)is chosen to go North to investigate the Arctic wolf and its impact on the caribou population. Along the way he encounters a host of intriguing characters, including a crazy-like-a-fox entrepreneurial bush pilot looking to make some sort of big score, a number of wacky bit players who I can easily imagine were not actors, but the real deal, and every bit as eccentric as they appeared; and an endearingly sage old Inuit of few words but many eloquent silences.

The investigator, Tyler, is not at all sure that he's up to the demands of the job, but forges ahead regardless, played with practical flair by Charles Martin Smith, a perfect choice for the lead here. I would be at a loss and panic-stricken if left alone on a frozen lake in Alaska, as his character Tyler is; Tyler takes it all in stride, trusting it will all be good in the morning, even though it is established early that for all the fact that he was chosen for this mission, he goes into it with a deep-seated terror of wolves.

After the assistance of the old Inuit man in getting centered on his path - and the abrupt disappearance of his benefactor, who has a way of coming and going that magicians would envy - Tyler finds himself deep in the bush country and immersed in the world of wolves before he realizes how completely they have taken him over. Knowledge and observance quickly negates his fear, and he is brought to a serenity of spirit and understanding of his place in the world that makes me wish I had the courage and stamina to go out and try it too.

A caveat: there is a culinary moment in this movie that might cause the squeamish some distress. Do what I did at the crucial moment; look at the ceiling, or recite to yourself, ""It's only chocolate, it's only chocolate."" You'll know when it gets close; they don't spring it on you; and it IS just chocolate.

When a researcher is sent to see if wolves are at fault for the decline in the caribou herds, he discovers an incredible side to these wonderful creatures that few will ever experience. In my opinion, nature has more to fear from the two legged animals than the four legged ones. The movie shows the cruelty of irresponsible hunters who think only of financial gain and man's ignorance of how nature balances herself if left alone.

Though the film has a sad ending, I'll watch it again, if only to take in the beauty of the landscape.

We had rented it from the local video store- I liked nature movies in general, and I had stumbled upon this one. In three days I had watched the movie four times, and at least two of those times all by my self.

You can't explain this movie. There is no point, no lablel. It's not about nature and man or any other thing like that. I was more disappointed with the book, because Mowat gave us all the information; he made us think how he wanted us to think. The true beauty of this film is that while the limited dialogue pushes some sort of nature-man relationship, you can over look it.

Obscene? I guess the people who think that this movie is obscene don't have mirrors in their bathrooms and don't wash their children when they are young- because it's obscene to see someone naked. Think what you will...

I can see how some would think that this movie is boring, that there is no plot, that there is no etc, etc, etc. I would be willing to bet that these people also have no way to occupy themselves if there are not things to do, things to stress about, or people to talk to. The movie speaks without words, without need of words. This can be extremely difficult to capt, but it is there...

I have seen this movie no less than 50 times. And every time, without fail, I am touched. I don't know how or why, but like the faint, howling music of Tyler's bassoon, the feeling of the movie seeps into you, chills your bones, and dies slowly away.

492514,4,630264223X,"I'm tired of films in which everything is spelled out. Some great twist is revealed right on cue at the very end, and we're all supposed to reel in shocking surprise. The relationships in Never Cry Wolf are communicated with near silence. The audience sees the bonds strengthen rather than simply be told it. This is a quiet film with as many twists and turns as a typical thriller, and it pays off.

Tyler has been sent to the northern reaches of Canada to investigate the endangerment of the caribou. It has already been concluded that it came about from excessive hunting from the wolves of the region, but since no one has ever actually witnessed a wolf kill a caribou, Tyler has to provide proof.

He accepted the job to find that part of himself that civilization forgot, but as he approaches his destination, the plane practically coming to pieces, he realizes what a mistake it was. Why would they send HIM? He knew he'd be lucky to last a day in the wilderness, let alone the six months for the research. It was probably some beaurocratic mix up, but it's too late to turn back.

He forms an uneasy bond with the wolves he finds. There is a great scene in which Tyler settles a territorial dispute with the wolf on the wolf's own terms, if you catch my drift. Understand that tere is nothing inherently funny about a man peeing on all of his belongings. It's the fact that he does so with good reason and without hesitation.

But there's something deeper going on beneath the surface. This film, in the tradition of Jack London, grapples with the idea of survivalism versus comfort. We see how out of touch the civilized world is from the natural world in a scene where some people discuss selling bottled water from the wilderness, exploiting people's fascination with nature. It seems naive, but we've been fascinated the whole film.

It does not shy from the darker side of the food chain. By the end we realize that survival and morality do not tend to go hand in hand. Tyler's peaceful observance of the wolves is not the natural order of things, as we are led to believe.

This film is quiet, inflective, and visually stunning, a superb piece of intelligent filmmaking. It will move to thought, emotion, and reexamination of your core values.",1126569600,11,2257,4.601990049751244

492517,4,630264223X,"The film Never Cry Wolf is interesting for its portrayal of the Wilderness North and the animals which inhabit it. The portions which show the various activities of the Arctic Wolves in particular I found to be fascinating. But this film was about more than that. Perhaps I should start at the beginning.

At the film's outset, we see a somewhat young, somewhat ideal scientist about to undertake a trip into the wilds of the far north in Alaska, to investigate the disappearance of the wild Caribou herds which used to be so numerous in the region and were now dying out. The U.S. government had sent him to investigate whether or not the Arctic Wolves were responsible for the decline. If so, they would kill the wolves to save the herds.

I would say that the film begins somewhat comically by showing us just how ill-prepared our intrepid protagonist is. He brings cases or beer, numerous scientific instruments, as well as piles of government forms, but quickly finds himself running out of food. Perhaps his unpreparedness physically is a metaphor for how unprepared he is mentally. Really, initially he is just as clueless about what is really going on as the people who sent him. He imagines that the issue is a simple one. Either the Caribou are being eaten by the wolves, or they aren't. Either the wolves are the bad guys, or innocent victims. What he finds out by the film's end surprises him.

I think you could say that the scientist and the various kinds of people he comes across throughout the movie represent various groups and ideologies found in the world around us. The group he represents at the outset (the U.S. government and the people it employs) are most concerned about conservation of natural resources so that they can be exploited in some way later; at least that's the impression I got. The man who takes him out to the wilderness probably represents the average man; more interested in survival and their own prosperity than anything else. The native people are interesting for several reasons. First of all, they are completely foreign to the scientist when he first meets them; an entirely different culture. But as he gets to know them, and they repeatedly help him, he gets to be friends with them and comes to admire their way of life. Theirs is a way of life that endeavors to understand nature and coexist with it rather than exploit it. Naturally, not all natives want things to stay the same way forever, and a native of the new generation has no qualms about killing all the wolves he can to make a few dollars.

In the end the scientist discovers that the caribou decline was the result of disease, not the wolves. In fact, the only thing keeping the herds healthy is the wolves (who thin out the weak and sickly from the herd). Are the wolves the bad guys, evil monsters bent on destroying something precious? Hardly. In the end, human beings seem to be more of a villain than anything in nature. Perhaps the real irony of the story though, is that the scientist came to care about the wolves and their environment more than anything else, taking the view of the old natives. He no longer cared about the issues that people were worried about. He became borderline obsessive about protecting the thing he was supposed to investigate. Interesting how learned the facts about what's really going on in nature can change a person's perspective.

The real lesson I got out of this film was to never make assumptions when it comes to the cause of a problem, and especially in nature. In other words, never cry wolf. Anyone with a strong interest in environmental science and wolves in particular will probably want to give this one a watch.",1117497600,3,3680,4.672839506172839
492568,5,630264223X,"For me this movie is a winner because of the uncomplicated way in which it makes its point. The awesome sweeping landscapes and the isolation of the man are haunting. There is beautiful footage of wolves. In terms of film-making it does for the wolf what Peter Mathiessen's book The Snow Leopard did for the snow leopard, i.e. it gives them an aura of mystique. But there is enough reality check to balance that, and the point about the wilderness being invaded and exploited and changed by man is very subtly made. This is an underplayed film because it doesn't need drama; the landscape is enough.

I also can't resist a rejoinder to a quote another reviewer produced as follows : {Vilhjalmur Stefanson, a famed explorer, said, ""An adventure is a sign of incompetence . . . If everything is well managed, if there are no miscalculations or mistakes, then the things that happen are only the things you expected to happen, for which you are ready and with which you can therefore deal.""} .....

...To which, with due respect to Mr Stefanson, I would respond that on the contrary, true adventure occurs when something unplanned and unscripted takes place, when you happen upon a road you didn't know was there and take it, when something you do NOT expect happens and you experience and and learn from it. Mr

Stefanson may have been a great explorer, but by his own definition I doubt that he had much adventure, so he perhaps is not quite qualified enough to lecture on the nature of adventure - or if he did have adventure, he didn't see it as such, which is sad. Here's a take on him from Jon Krakauer : ''Stefanson was a guy who bragged that he never had adventures. He said that if you have an adventure, you're doing something wrong, that if you really plan things out in the vein of Amundsen, you don't have adventures. (Now, having said this, Stefanson relates sort of proudly how he almost got ambushed by a polar bear. Stefanson had plenty of adventures!)''",1114732800,,1968,4.601139601139601
492569,5,630264223X,"This film, in my opinion Carroll Ballard's best (he also directed The Black Stallion and Fly Away Home), is a visual feast. It has  excellent performances from the entire (small) cast and is both funny and serious... even profound. There are some flaws, but in the face of the haunting score, the stunning cinematography, the well-honed script (much of it by the film's star, CM Smith), and the direction of an unsung master of the medium who addresses themes of nature, these flaws are unimportant. When I teach film classes I use the opening credits to illustrate the power of the long shot in nature, the campfire scene wherein Ootek invokes the spirit of the wolf as an example of use of natural light and shadow. It does not take the easy or expected way; it is both ambiguous and didactic to some extent.

Sadly, the film remains underappreciated by Disney. There are no extras on the DVD at all, and this is criminal, considering that a documentary on the film's production was made.

I saw this film in the theatre with my parents when I was 8 years old.  Even at that age this movie left me breathless in all the good ways.  It was beautiful, funny, touching and inspiring.  It treated the subject of nature and conservation in way that I hadn't seen before and rarely since.  The haunting silence of this film is mezmerizing and the dialogue is spare but wonderfully written.  It is a masterpiece.

In regard to the negative comments refeencing the nudity in this film: Every person (including children) has genitals.  We see them when we shower, when we use the washroom, when we change out clothes, etc.  Why is it that to some people seing a person's genitals (in a non-sexual way) in a film is considered worse than violence?  The scenes in this film that portray nudity do not do so in a sexual way.  In fact when Tyler (the main character) is shown in the nude it only helps to re-enforce the plot and the feeling that this scientist is in essence trying to let go of his humanization for a time, to be wild, like the wolves and caribou in a place so far from human habitation.  Even as a child I understood and appreciated this.  Parents who try to protect their children from this kind of learning are doing misguidedly in my opinion.  This is an enriching film for all ages regarless of the brief nudity and perhaps to some small extent, because of it.

Compared to other films that children could be watching (including many animated films from Disney and others, this movie has a lot to offer.  There is no violence, sexual content, bad language, or anything else that parents often neglect to see in films that are supposed to be for children.

The pissing contest (again, literally) occurs as the alpha male marks his territory; then Smith drinks TONS of tea and sets about peeing at the perimeter of his own territory. There are other wonderful scenes, such as when Smith traps and eats mice to prove that the wolves don't need to kill caribou to survive: they do just fine with mice. Lots and lots of mice. Another unforgettable scene is Smith stripped naked and running with the pack through the green tundra of spring, back and forth, back and forth; to watch that scene is to experience his exhilaration firsthand.

This film tells the odyssey of a man dispatched to study the wolves in the Canadian north to determine if they are killing the Caribou in the area. The simple plot can be interpreted on several different levels. For many it will be a simple adventure story. Some will learn something and overcome their misconceptions and suspicions about wolves (race). For others Tyler is a man who is an outsider and is detached from the civilized society he leaves behind only to become a member of the sylvan society he is sent to study. No longer in the constructed reality of man he begins to see the true reality that is nature. Tyler comes in touch with what Jack London called the ""Primordial Beast"". As Tyler gets in touch with the ""Beast"" within himself he learns what the wolf and the land means to others. To the Natives the wolf has a spiritual as well as an economic significance. The pilot who takes Tyler to the study area only sees the real estate value of the land. In the end it is not the wolf that is a threat to nature but man himself, no matter how harmoniously in touch with nature he may be, that is the culprit for all environmental crises.
NCW also has one of the more honest and truthful depictions of Native Peoples ever on film. The glimpse is of real people as opposed to actors playing a stereotypical role. Their authenticity, along with the wolves and cinematography, gives a documentary feel to the film. The cinematography is some of the best ever filmed. There is also little dialog in the film with the character's actions speaking louder than words.
NCW was also ahead of its time in 1983. With the current debate for drilling in ANWR and the reintroduction of wolves in the Southwest NCW is more relevant today than it was twenty years ago. NCW will make you want to put on a pack and trek 20 miles to the middle of nowhere and find your ""Beast"".",1049673600,,1958,4.441666666666666

492625,5,630264223X,"Upon first viewing, this movie seemed to me to be little more than a pretty, weak-plotted 'conservation' film, but many subsequent viewings reveal such a wonderfully subtle plot it is nothing short of amazing that I missed it completely the first times through.
Not wanting to ruin any 'evolutions' of this movie for others, I'll just take the famous running-with-the-caribou scene. People's reactions this scene usually vary as follows:
1) Puritanical conservatives see it as an example of gross obscenity with a man 'revealing himself'. [This despite the fact that this movie lacks anything resembling such sexuality or sensuality. And yes, I've found a decent number of people that do find this scene OBscene for a PG movie.]
2) Your average film viewer just sees Tyler watching wolves chase down caribou as purely a spectator and a human one at that.
3) Yet others yet see Tyler as a man being utterly ridiculous and chasing down caribou himself. [I was in this group for many viewings]
I finally realized that this scene was really a moment of self-actualization for Tyler, himself lamenting earlier in the film always condemned to be an observer. For a moment, he understands Ootek, and like Ootek was as a boy, Tyler is ""devoured by the wolf."" At the moment of this chase, Tyler was a man only in physical appearance. For all other intents and purposes, he is a wolf. At least that's how I see it now. Maybe my opinion will change again the next time I watch it.
It's sad and telling of today's Disney how they distance themselves from this movie, retaining ownership only in the most formal of ways, so they still collect the profits at least. Only the most vigilant viewers will even notice this is a Disney film at all. Their name appears only in fine print copyright notices. It appears otherwise to the unassuming person to have been made independently and (very strangely!) a distributor's/third party logo (Anchor Bay) takes the place of a studio logo (Disney's) any place you might expect one. I've never seen such an attempt by a studio to distance themselves from a GREAT release, yet Disney plasters their name and logo all over a myriad of truly awful direct-to-video animation ventures and also promote to this day the movie 'Tron', a contemporary of 'Never Cry Wolf'.
I guess I'm just as happy they've let this movie be. It stands on its own well enough and doesn't have to have the full court press from a major studio to convince people to like it and buy it. Give it SEVERAL chances, you will find it a very meaningful way to spend a little spare time.",1044748800,10,2576,4.713968957871397

We had hot tea and reindeer soup and watched ""Never Cry Wolf"" on national TV.  Even though we have a video copy at home, this was special, with the winds howling around the old wooden restaurant building and the sky above the ice-covered ocean a deep black.
Charles Martin Smith is at his best as the suddenly transplanted researcher.
But I know bush pilots like the one played by Brian Dennehy---they fly all over Arctic Alaska and keep us all going!!!
And the Inuits Ootok and Mike are real as well, especially their knowledge of the wildlife, and their low-key and economical use of words.

492629,4,630264223X,"This fictionalization of the Farley Mowat book about his Arctic adventures studying wolves is amazingly enough perhaps the most controversial film Disney studios ever made.  How sad is that?  The reasons for the controversy would seem minor: first, the movie is not entirely true to Mowat's book; two, it's lightly plotted; and three, a man is seen running around naked in the tundra.  To which I say, so what? so what? and gee, how offensive.  (Maybe they should have clothed the wolves.)
The latter complaint is the major reason for all the ranting by some ""reviewers.""  To them a Disney film showing human nakedness seems a sacrilege and they want their bowdlerized world returned to them, and they want Disney censured and made to promise never to do anything like that again!  The complaint that there wasn't enough tension in the film is also off base since this is a contemplative, even spiritual film, not a slick thriller.  People with sound-bite attention spans who need to mainline exploding cars and ripped flesh to keep them interested need not apply.
The criticism that Director Carroll Ballard's film is not entirely true to the book is legitimate, but I would point out that movies are seldom if ever entirely true to their source material.  A film is one kind of media with its particular demands while a book is another.  It is impossible to completely translate a book into a movie.  Something is always inevitably lost, but something is often gained.  Here the cinematography and the beautiful musical score by Mark Isham are fine compensations.
The acting by Charles Martin Smith as ""Tyler"" (Farley Mowat) and Brian Dennehy as Rosie, the exploitive redneck bushpilot, and Samason Jorah as Mike the compromised Inuit (who sells wolf skins for dentures) and especially Zachary Ittimangnaq as Ootek, the quiet, wise man of the north are also pluses.  Note how compactly the main issues of the film are exemplified in these four characters.  Indeed, what this film is about is the dying of a way of life, not just that of the wolves, but of the Inuit people themselves who are losing their land and their resources while their young people are being seduced away from what is real and true and time-honored for the glittering trinkets of the postmodern world.  This is a story of impending loss and it is as melancholy as the cold autumn wind that blows across the tundra.
What I think elevates this above most nature films is first the intense sense of what it would be like for a lower forty-eight kind of guy to survive in a most inhospitable wilderness, and second the witty presentation of some of the scenes.  Ballard works hard to make sure we understand that it is cold, very cold and desolate and that there are dangers of exposure and weather and just plain loss of perspective that have killed many a would-be adventurer and might very well kill Tyler.  I think it was entirely right that near the end of the film we get the sense that Tyler is going off the deep end emotionally, that the majestic and profoundly melancholy experience has been too much for him.
Tyler begins as a greenhorn biologist dropped alone onto a frozen lake amid snow covered mountains rising in the distance so that we can see immediately how puny he is within this incredibly harsh vastness.  The following scene when Ootek finds him and leaves him and he chases Ootek until he drops, and then Ootek saves him, gives him shelter, and leaves again without a word, was just beautiful.  And the scenes with the ""mice"" and running naked among the caribou and teaching Ootek to juggle were delightful.  The territorial marking scene was apt and witty and tastefully done.  (At least, I don't think the wolves were offended.)
This movie was not perfect, however.  For one thing, those were not ""mice"" that Tyler found his tent infested with.  I suspect they were lemmings posing for the cameras.  Those who have seen the film about the making of this movie undoubtedly know what they were; please advise me if you do.  Also the ""interior"" of Tyler's tent was way too big to fit into the tent as displayed.  Also it would be important from a nutritional point of view for Tyler to eat the ""mice"" raw as the wolves did!  (The actual creatures that Mowat ate I assume were mice.)  If Tyler had to exist purely on roasted and boiled rodent for many months, he would encounter some nutritional deficiencies.  Still, eating a diet of the whole, uncooked mouse would be sustaining whereas a diet of lean meat only would not.  (Add blubber and internal organs for an all-meat diet to work.)  Incidentally, the Inuit people get their vitamin C from blubber and the contents of the stomachs of the animals they kill.
Where were the mosquitos and the biting flies that the tundra is infamous for?
Since this movie appeared almost twenty years ago, the public image of the wolf has greatly improved and wolves have been reintroduced to Yellowstone Park.  I think everybody in this fine production can take some credit for that.",1027814400,91,5015,4.743087557603687

492678,5,630264223X,"Very rarely does one film come together in all aspects to become one of the best art forms. Most films are a collaborative effort of hundreds of people who all have their finger in the mix. Studios want big name actors, directors, producers, everybody gets a say in the final product, and many times you end up with drivel! Not so in this film. It is remarkable in it's simplicity. (Compare this film to ""Dances with wolves."" You know the really BIG production of this same plot?)
This is definitely a case of less is better. The beauty of the wilderness with the haunting score and understated acting of several ""non"" actors as priciples. (Check the credits, no cast of hundreds here!) This film proves that ""real"" actors can be replaced rather easily. But I digress.
This is a true example of the art of film making. Slow moving film? Maybe... but it's a thing to be enjoyed like a good wine, slowly and even more than once. Like a previous reviewer said, ""How many films have an impact more than 14 years later and still stay in your physique?"" I couldn't have said it better.

492679,5,630264223X,"A landmark film in regards to addressing the issue of man's interference with nature, Never Cry Wolf is absolutely stunning in every way.  Let's not get sidetracked by the fact that it is based on Farley Mowat's experiences and strays a bit from the book; the intent and message here are delivered in a subtle one-two combination!  Charles Martin Smith's performance is absolutely perfect, as his character of Tyler slowly evolves from the naive and totally unprepared young man dumped so unceremoniously on the ice by rough and gruff bushpilot Rosie (fantastically portrayed by Brian Dennehy), to an accepted member of the wolf family he has so lovingly researched and gradually learned from.  Tyler's interaction with the Inuit natives, particularly Zachary Ittimangnaq and Samson Jorah, in refreshingly genuine roles, is touchingly portrayed and extremely important to the maturation process that Tyler slowly undergoes.  Smith's narration throughout is wonderfully done, and is the thread that holds this entire story together.
There are some real cinematic gems here:  Rosie's in-flight maintenance on his failing, sputtering airplane, Tyler's ""gourmet"" meals of the mice that completely overrun his camp, the peeing contest between the two dominant males (one wolf, one man), Tyler's running with the pack as they chase down their latest meal, and Tyler's mentor, Ootek, learning how to juggle.  Also, Never Cry Wolf has one of the most poignant and touching endings ever filmed, as Tyler, cold and wet, overwhelmed by the sense of loss that he feels as Man closes in on and changes forever the pristine system he has just learned to appreciate and has become a part of, plays a mournful, haunting tune on his bassoon as the snow slowly falls on and around him.
