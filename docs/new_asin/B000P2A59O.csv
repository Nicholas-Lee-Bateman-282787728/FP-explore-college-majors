2807646,2,B000P2A59O,"This movie is old and it shows.  It was entertaining, like watching a train wreck; I actually watched the whole of it.  It's not based on reality even though astral projection does exist.  I think it would have been better if it would have been based on reality more.  It's something to watch when you're bored, and it was fun to see Stephanie Powers before Hart to Hart.",1356307200,,371,4.411764705882353
2807647,2,B000P2A59O,"This is another one of those 70s TV films with astral projection, murder, invisibility, whatever, with a nut case chasing a fetching blond.  The characters are insipid and 2-dimensional, the story is plodding, but I did pay attention occasionally, which is more than I can say for others of the genre.  Bad guy with special powers, smart cop, climax, etc.

Recommended only if you can get it for free.  I am amazed this is offered for sale.",1290211200,,440,4.675324675324675
2807648,2,B000P2A59O,"The DVD is a DVD-R sold by Amazon. After I bought it I found this is the alternate title for Invisible Strangler -- not sure if that print is any better, but be aware there is a commercial DVD for this movie under that title.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invisible-Strangler/dp/B00025X3O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invisible Strangler</a>&nbsp;There are numerous scratches and fades in the print, but overall it looks pretty good for an unrestored film.  The highlight of the movie for me was simply seeing Elke Sommer, who looks gorgeous, but all of the actors are saddled with the hopeless task of doing something with the murky story they are placed in.  The special effects are poor, and the whole affair plays out like a made-for-TV movie -- it is nothing special, and not scary at all, revolving around the tired ""I hate my mother"" type psycho with an ""astral projection"" twist.  It is difficult to recommend since it is such a bad movie, and I give it two stars simply for the appearance of Elke Sommer, which is stretching it.  Best moments: Elke Sommer's wardrobe and desperate attempts to play her part.  Worst moments: Long, boring non-action sequences, FX that make silent movie special effects look superb, and Robert Foxworth's hairstyle.  Puzzling moments: Stephanie Powers -- she looks great, but used so little you almost wonder why she's in the movie at all.",1263945600,10,1417,5.247787610619469
2807649,4,B000P2A59O,"A pretty decent looking copy of a rare movie. The negative is probably ignored and degraded, so this may be the best print we get.
The DVD-R played fine.",1233878400,2,153,4.310344827586207
8188435,1,B000P2A59O,"First, I watched this via streaming on Amazon, so I don't know if buying a new DVD would make the picture quality better than the one I viewed. It's very fuzzy, filled with scratches & one time I think the screen actually went blank with symbols flashing on it the way old movies end via old movie projectors.  All that would be ok, if the plot were good. But it isn't. I only watched because I never saw this movie before & I love horror, especially 70s horror.  On the plus side, it does star Robert Foxworth (for some reason he looked like Mr Brady of the Brady Bunch during his groovy perm era), a youngish Stephanie Powers & Elke Summers. Also thrown in out of the blue, is a scene where you see the naked butts of both Foxworth & Powers. The ""astral"" FX are actually comical & the movie is the typical killer nut with a mommy complex, except this nut can disappear/appear out of thin air & shoot laser beams out of his eyes.  All in all, a jumbled mess that is quite boring. I can't recommend this film at all to anyone for any reason whatsover.  And I love bad cheesy movies, so this actually shocks me.",1485129600,3,1110,4.246445497630332

8188439,3,B000P2A59O,"I will start this review with my biases: I love anything from the 70s, particularly sci-fi and horror; B movies have always held a place in my little black heart for comedy; extremely poor editing/directing/acting are engaging in themselves providing an additional layer of entertainment under the right conditions.

This movie is about astral projection and serial killing but that doesn't really matter. It's the other stuff. The first five minutes of the movie show our killer torment the only other prisoner in his cell block by making the guy's eyeglasses telekinetically shatter while they're on his face leaving him a heaping mess ripe for the objects that will be thrown at him: shoes (one at a time), books, and finally, his mattress to which I thought he would succumb (he lived). Then there's the drab palette of drab brown, drab green, and drab gold;  poorly placed and executed, comic relief, mostly by Stefanie Powers who has embarrassed the human race after her loud and frankly, stupid role, in this film; the clicking pen - whoever's idea this was, consider yourself marked if you're still alive; and jump cuts that left me disoriented. The film is compelled to spell everything out to you, in fact, I might have learned something (I need to confirm it), the paranormal specialist explains the nuanced difference between psychokinesis and telekinesis (the former acts at short distances, the latter at long). All this explaining leaves the viewers thinking parts to focus on the giant hairstyles worn by the men, Elkie Sommers' ivory stockings she wore with her bikini (were they really there???), the yellow bathwater (maybe it was Vitabath?), and the unintentional jump-cuts. I have already contacted Rifftrax as I do not know how this wasn't MST's in the first place. If you enjoy things like The Visitor or movies whose audio was either lost or too poor that they just narrated the whole thing then this is for you.",1436745600,2,1936,4.953846153846154
8188440,1,B000P2A59O,Badly shot and acted. Really not the fun kind of bad either.,1433721600,,60,4.083333333333333
8188441,3,B000P2A59O,"I am not a puritan, but I found this movie a tad over the top!!!!!!!!! There are over ten murder victims in the movie. Which take it out of the science fiction genre, and puts it firmly into the horror genre ( or perhaps both). And did anyone pick up on the fact that they were either women - blond women; or police - law enforcement officers. The first victim is a cemetary security guard, and one other policeman not involved directly with trying to protect the women the serial killer is after.

Was this movie - really, at one time the movie of the week, there is nudity, perhaps it was made for cable or never released.",1419897600,,624,4.288135593220339

8188444,4,B000P2A59O,"This is a bad film no matter how you slice it. I liked the film for its humor, intentional and unintentional, and the cheese. Roger Sands (Frank Ashmore) is a homicidal maniac who kills women who remind him of his celebrity mother. He uses Astral Projection to make himself invisible and escape (eat you heart out Rosicrucians) so he can kill again.

Two policemen are assigned to find him. The lead investigator is Lt. Charles Barrett (Robert Foxworth).  Holt (TV star Mark Slade) his side kick is annoying as he constantly clicks his pen (flicks his Bic as we used to say). He wears nicely creased bell bottoms.

The film has scenes where I laughed out loud like the shoe tossing scene, the face of the strangled girl, the littering scene, and of course the birthday cake.

It is a fun cheesy film, not real science fiction for purists.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity unless you count Stefanie Powers' butt. Elke Sommer in a bikini. Part of a 50 film sci-fi collection.",1369267200,3,984,4.632183908045977
