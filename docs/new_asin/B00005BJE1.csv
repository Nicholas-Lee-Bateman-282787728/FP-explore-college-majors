7937774,5,B00005BJE1,"This is exactly why Amazon needs to make a deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment. This is one of my favorite cartoons as a child, and its over 40 dollars for a disk with only a few episodes. WE NEED FULL SEASON BOXSETS OF THIS SHOW AMAZON, PLEASE! Buena Vista Home Entertainment has the rights to this show, and they simply refuse to release it on Season boxsets. You did a good job by getting Nickelodeon shows, please try to make a deal with them. I know that it would sell.",1222819200,,479,4.274725274725275
7937775,4,B00005BJE1,"These were good episodes. My only complaint is that the two episodes out of past parts 1 and 2. Those episodes were also realeased in the legend of wolverine set. Why would they have two of the same episodes release in two sets. They should have all of the episodes out on DVD, selling seasons.",1177718400,,294,4.363636363636363

7937777,2,B00005BJE1,"This DVD probably deserves a better rating than I'm actually giving it. It's just that the episodes are out of order with the tv series which is quite frustrating, and the episodes just aren't the best selection. Neither of the 2 part stories needed to be a 2 part story and they seemed to be stretched out. However, at least one of the episodes looks to the future and The Phoenix Saga. In fact, this DVD has episodes before The Phoenix Saga and one after The Phoenix Saga. Here's my recommendation: Go get The Phoenix Saga!",1027296000,10,525,4.479166666666667
7937778,5,B00005BJE1,"Universal Studios make it true.
5 episodes of the Xmen with great audio and picture quality.
Basic menus ,subtitles are the only thing required.
The only con are the covers which shown the X-men villains instead of the X-men.
They are worthy so I WANT MORE EPISODES!!!!!.",1021593600,9,271,4.787234042553192
7937779,5,B00005BJE1,"Finally, the BEST animated Marvel series ever makes it's way to DVD. Agreed, I would like to see the episodes released in the order they aired, but hey! this is a start! The disc itself contains five episodes, which is a pretty good bang for the buck, and although the menus are pretty basic, the transfers are as close to PERFECTION as you're ever going to get. The sound hasn't been touched (it's in the original stereo) but it doesn't need to be! I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this disc! For X-Men fans old and new, do not miss this and any other XMen Animated Series releases from Universal.",993600000,8,587,4.444444444444445
