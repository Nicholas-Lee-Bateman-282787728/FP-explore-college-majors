1400573,5,B000056VQS,Hal Leonard Guitar Method is a useful product who wants to begin to play acoustic or elecric guitar. It is more enjoyable than a guitar method book.,986774400,17,148,4.518518518518518
1400593,5,B000056VQS,"I have wanted to get back to playing my guitar, I started over 20 years ago, this dvd it very easy to follow I recommend it highly",1328140800,,130,3.8518518518518516
1400594,4,B000056VQS,"I just set a goal for myself to teach myslef to play guitar. This book is really good. I am learning fast and easy on how to play the guitar. The only down side is that the chords in the back of the book are hard to finger then some other ways. I bought my book used so the previous person had crossed out the chords and put in the easier ones to finger. Otherwise this book is a great starter book. This book unfortunatly doesnt have tabs for some of you people who can't read music. I can read music I have been playing the Tenor Saxophone for about 4 years now, so reading music comes easy to me. But yeah this book lacks the usefulnes of tabs.",1295654400,,647,4.023255813953488

1400596,1,B000056VQS,"I got this DVD along with the Guitar Method book 1.  They came in a pack with a price of 25 dollars.  They said it was on sale too!  WRONG.

This DVD is HORRIBLE.  Basically, all you need to know is, do you know how to take care of your guitar?  Hold your picks?  Basic stuff.  You know what?  You can find these tips EASILY on internet.  What else does the DVD offer?  What the book, Guitar Method 1, has.  You do not need to watch this DVD at all.  It has repeating information that you'd see in books.  Why would you spend money on this piece of... nothing?

Now you may be thinking, ""maybe the DVD shows us how musics are played.""  No.  The book gives you everything.  You do not need this DVD at start.

For the Guitar Method books, buy the complete set.  It is 15 dollars for the complete set while each book of this series is about 10 dollars each.  Once you finish the book 1, you'll want the book 2 and 3 to finish the series of learning sequence.",1241049600,2,956,4.059459459459459
1400597,1,B000056VQS,"There isn't much on this DVD - perhaps its only 40 minutes at most.  It's only 11 very short songs, and a few riffs and licks, less than most guitar books.  Also, the poor editing of the DVD makes practicing along with the DVD much, much harder than it needs to be.  Do not buy this DVD without the book, or you'll never be able to practice enough to really learn the songs before you thow your guitar thru your TV.  The idea of a DVD to go with a book is genius, and the material and the featured teacher are great, but they need more material, and a better idea of how a student might actually use it.",1230854400,6,603,4.042016806722689
1400598,3,B000056VQS,"I recently purchased the Hal Leonard Guitar Method book, packaged with a CD and this DVD.  The DVD is good, because there is a brief explanation by Kolb before each song, but a beginner needs to work on the book alone before jumping in to the DVD.  The DVD should probably only be sold together with the book.  One other catch: the written music that scrolls along the bottom of the screen is sometimes too slow and often doesn't appear until Kolb begins to play.  The viewer needs to see the music to begin the song.  I had to get a quick look at the beginning of the song, then rewind before I could play many of the songs.  Stll worth while, but get the book also.",1211760000,3,667,4.21259842519685
1400599,1,B000056VQS,"As a professional musician (not guitar) and teacher, it is possible that I approach this with a higher expectation of what should happen in an educational setting than most; but I am hard pressed to find a ""method"" to this DVD, or really to identify where any actual teaching occurs. All this DVD contains are mediocre demonstrations with no explanations as to how to do things or why they work. If actually taught, the material in this DVD would be great, but its really nothing more than a play-along DVD that leaves figuring out the why and how to the student. Further, there is no technique taught past elementary tips on holding the guitar (""most people hold it kind of like this ..."") and holding the picking (""grab it like this and then make fine adjustments""). I've encoutered guitar lessons with better content and clearer instruction on youtube and am very sad to have spent money to purchase this DVD. Look elsewhere!",1210204800,11,928,4.734567901234568
1400600,2,B000056VQS,"I bought this dvd because of the list of songs in Product Description. It says: ""You'll learn to play the songs:...."" but in most of the cases they are not the songs but small riffs. Also this dvd is difficult to navigate and you can not loop the exercises.

I learn some tricks from the dvd but the bottom line is that I was disappointed.",1161907200,8,339,4.2153846153846155
1400601,4,B000056VQS,"This course (DVD + Books) may not be the most fun, but it does cover all the bases better than any other SINGLE course out there. To tell you my honest opinion if having fun while learning the guitar is what you want to do, then I would say go with ""Guitar Basics"" by Bruce Buckingham and work your way up through the Musicians Institue series of courses. The main difference between these series is that Guitar Method starts with reading music and picking out ""lame"" melodies, where as Guitar Basics starts you out with playing chords and chord progressions. So the decision is really in the hands of where you want to start. Chords or notes?",1150329600,22,643,4.504273504273504
1400602,5,B000056VQS,"I bought this in order to supplement the method books I am currently studying. Its much more informative than the ""Dummies"" dvd and you will learn more. My only complaint is when using it to do chapter searches(get to a specific point) it is very confusing. It also would be better with a supplemental book that contains the songs you learn. Still buy it you will be glad you did. I would also recommend Hal Leonards Method books as well. Enjoy!!!!",1024617600,40,448,4.54320987654321

7932692,5,B000056VQS,"I had book 1 and 2 20 years ago. I've kept them around all this time in hopes of picking up my guitar again. I love that all 3 books are together, and the audio file that comes with it is a game changer. It really has already made a difference in the quality of my playing. I have seen other ""learn to play guitar"" books, and in my opinion this is the best out there. Exactly the right pace and method to learn. I wish the dvd had a few more instructions about the intracacies of playing guitar, but overall it's great.",1486252800,,519,4.048543689320389
7932693,5,B000056VQS,"Incredible for a musician to learn how to play the guitar. If you currently know how to play the piano etc, this is for you. It's a great refresher and great way to quickly learn. If you are not a musician I would recommend purchasing this and a music theory textbook. I believe Hal Leonard has a corresponding textbook. Totally recommend.",1464825600,,339,4.573770491803279
