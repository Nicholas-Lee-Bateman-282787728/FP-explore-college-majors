3726994,5,B001O4CE8M,"Children will love this DVD. The puppies are so cute and friendly, kids will follow everything they do, including learning the lyrics of the songs and the names of all the planets. An added bonus is video of the first moon landing and amazing close-ups of the sun. Another bonus feature even shows kids how to make their own  sock puppets.

It's great to find a DVD that you can feel comfortable about letting small children watch. It's pure fun and learning.",1232409600,,459,4.585365853658536
8329396,2,B001O4CE8M,"Bought this for my preschool class when I was doing a space theme, they enjoyed the first 5-10 minutes or so then lost interest. Would not recommend for kids 5 and younger.",1373760000,,172,4.40625
8329397,5,B001O4CE8M,"This is a great kids movie. My toddler plays 'Space Man' every day running thru the house with his space toys, so I was looking for something kid friendly and age appropriate as he's not quite 3 yrs old yet. This movie is perfect! It has catchy songs and the segments are short enough that they don't lose your attention. I learned quite a bit from this video as well! The actual movie is only about 1/2 hour or so, but that's just long enough for a toddler! Fun and educational!",1365120000,,479,4.274725274725275
8329398,5,B001O4CE8M,"My 4 year old grandson insists on starting every day by watching this dvd.  He has the song and most of the dialog memorized and has amazed many an adult with his knowledge of space.  One father he shared his learned knowledge with call to ask for the name of this dvd so he could learn more.  Not only that, he has shown increased use of his soft puppets which stimulate his imagination in other directions. This dvd is true evidence that learning can be fun!",1248739200,,460,4.325581395348837
8329399,5,B001O4CE8M,"My 4 year old grandson just loves this wonderful DVD, we have watched it back to back so many times I almost can mouth the right along with the disc, I have noticed him checking out the sky when we go out of the house, this wonderful DVD opens so many doors for kids on their level, it makes it possible for them to take a step up in the right direction, if you have a smart kid or grandchild, get this disc!, you can't lose with it.",1247702400,,433,3.9318181818181817
8329400,5,B001O4CE8M,"AstroPuppies is a great learning tool, and the creators have caught my attention with interesting information that is either left out or I've missed out of boredom on other space-learning videos I've seen.  There are segments that captured the attention of even my 18-month-old, but I also found the entire video enjoyable.  As a former teacher, I thought it had much to offer children and was likely to keep their attention with the mixed format of song, learning, and narration times.  Plus, kids were obviously involved in its creation, which will reach their peers better than just another adult voice.",1240444800,,606,5.04
8329401,4,B001O4CE8M,AstroPuppies in space is both intellingent and completely innocent.  Charming and educational at the same time.  Catchy quirky tunes and adorable puppetry mixed beautifully with stunning NASA space photography.  Perfect for kids with curiosity.,1238198400,,244,6.117647058823529
8329402,5,B001O4CE8M,"The DVD arrived just after the weather turned from winter to warm springtime.  The grandsons (aged 2 1/2 and 3 1/2) still wanted to watch the DVD off and on between swinging and digging dirt.  That is is real compliment for them to give up dirt digging to watch a DVD.  The astropuppies are really cute and the DVD is entertaining and informative for both children and adults.  I may even learn the planet order after watching the movie a few times.  The pictures of the moon landing, sun and other celestial objects is great.  We had the extra benefit of having the ISS and Space Shuttle pass overhead several times during the first week we had the DVD so they had a good chance to relate the DVD with real life.",1237593600,,713,4.363636363636363
8329403,5,B001O4CE8M,"I have a five-year-old little boy who sometimes has a tough time paying attention to children's TV shows and DVDs.  However, Astropuppies in Space has quickly become, as he told me, ""his favorite movie ever!""  It has a wonderful way of communicating great science facts while still staying entertaining.  We were just at a planetarium near our town, and my son kept referring to things he saw there, prefacing each with, ""I saw this on Astropuppies.""  If your child has any interest in space (or sock puppets for that matter), I highly recommend this DVD.",1237161600,,555,4.810526315789474
8329404,5,B001O4CE8M,"Just got the ""AstroPuppies in Space"" DVD for my daughters (6 and 8). They loved it! In their words- ""it is SOOO cute and funny!"".",1235779200,,129,4.2
8329405,5,B001O4CE8M,Astro Puppies in Space was an adorable video that had beautiful images of our solar system.  It was filled with educational and interesting material and completely mesmerized our eight year old and her friends.  We would highly recommend it for any children ages 4 year-10 years.  I am a former teacher and I wish I had this great video when I introduced the solar system to my first grade class.  I would love to see it incorporated into a science curriculum at the first grade level or for any family at home viewing.,1233273600,,519,4.548387096774194
