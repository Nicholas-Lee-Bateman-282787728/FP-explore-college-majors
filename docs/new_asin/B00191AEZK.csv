3422275,5,B00191AEZK,"I disagree with the complaints that the movie was slow or pointless or uncertain of its direction/style.  Yes, I will concede that for a while, in the fist 1/3 of the film the music chosen was some dark string music written in a minor chord, but there's no reason to discredit the entire film for one bad selection of music.  The characters were interesting and the story moved along nicely.  I think people have forgotten that silence can move a story along as well as dialogue or action.  It was used sparingly and well.  There were some lose ends left for the viewer to decide what happens, but that's not a bad thing either.  I think it's well worth a watch.",1439683200,3,662,4.429752066115703
3422276,1,B00191AEZK,"Boring.  Could have done better.  I had to hit fast-forward button on my remote control to some pieces of its story that I need to know before ""wrapping up"" this movie (finish at its ending credits).",1439683200,,199,4.5
3422277,2,B00191AEZK,"I decided to watch ""Stealth"" after I had read those two very positive reviews posted on Amazon. And? Yet again I had this feeling that I must have been watching another film than those two men.
Even if the main plot is quite interesting, I got bored and tired after first 30 minutes. The director seems to be wishy-washy about the way his film should be like. I am not sure if this is a gay-theme comedy or a drama or a thriller (yep, thanks to the music in some scenes). Btw, once you introduce music in a scene, it should help to build up the atmosphere, to enhance it. In this case we have for example a scene where main character talks to his father (about nothing horrific, plain chit-chat), but the music in the backround could have served well in every thiller.
In my opinion is one of the movies that you forget about while watching it. Not totally bad, but not good either.",1327363200,5,882,4.319277108433735
3422278,2,B00191AEZK,"Amiable but rather pointless film about a somewhat estranged brother and sister discovering their Polish heritage during an impromptu trip from Switzerland to Poland.  This movie can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a gay comedy, a family drama or a road movie, and so doesn't succeed in being any of these.  This is obviously a labor of love on the part of writer/director/actor Lionel Baier who stars as the brother (who also happens to be named Lionel Baier), but it fails to engender much in the way of interest for the audience.

Good performances by Baier and Natacha Koutchoumov as the sister, but not much else to recommend it.",1316563200,5,642,4.714285714285714
3422279,5,B00191AEZK,"What a surprising treasure this film is! Congrats to Water Bearer for bringing eclectic ""STEALTH"" to USA audiences. If I could rate it a ""10"", I would. Everything about it - the extremely personal twist n' turn plot, the  competent and attractive actors, the crisp European cinematography, the gorgeous Ravel music weave pure unadulterated magic. Hey, the dialogue is French/Polish with English subtitles. I usually run for the provincial hills at such a disclosure but in this case the bilingual factor is (for whatever reason) an unexpected PLUS. In so many ways ""STEALTH"" slyly seduces you to sit up and take notice. And take notice you will.",1265414400,14,645,5.02803738317757
3422280,5,B00191AEZK,"""Stealth"" is a clever and highly amusing story about arrested development and non-lethal obsession.  Lionel and Lucie are a twenty-something brother and sister pair living in Lausanne, Switzerland.  They are both attractive, well-employed, have supportive and accepting parents and are involved in affectionate relationships.

Lionel is gay, has a handsome and attentive boyfriend, but is bored and antsy about the future.  Lucie is straight, has a hunky Italian boyfriend who loves her, but is forced to confront the future of her relationship when she finds that she is pregnant.

Lionel's long-time interest in a family connection with Poland turns into an obsession when he meets a pretty Polish au pair with visa problems.  His decision to marry the girl starts a chain reaction that causes him to break up with his long-suffering boyfriend and ends with his sister ""kidnapping"" him and taking off for Poland to exorcise her brother's Polish demon.

The sibling road trip is marked by some hilarious dialogue and a series of misadventures.  Lionel is beaten up when he intervenes in a domestic argument.  His enraged attacker tries to destroy their borrowed car at 70 MPH, inflicting further damage on Lionel.  Bleeding and dirty, Lionel encounters an angel of mercy--hunky and friendly Stanislaus--in a public restroom.  The very sympathetic (and conveniently French-speaking) Stanislaus takes the Swiss pair under his wing and a romance between the two guys blooms quickly.

But the road trip must continue, and things go rapidly south when they leave ""oasis Stanislaus"" and head for Warsaw to track down the Polish ancestor who is the obstensible reason for the trip.  They very quickly have their car stolen along with most of their money.  Against the odds, dirty and broke, they finish the ancestor quest at the Polish National Archives and discover (also conveniently) a living and friendly family link.

The adventure brings some maturity and clarity to the siblings and the film ends with both ready to face life with greater courage and improved prospects for happiness.

This is a quirky story with a very European perspective, but it's lovable and fun.  You care about every character in it and the ending, while a little vague, is a classic ""feel-good"" one.  Highly recommended.",1237075200,22,2296,5.176151761517615
8271562,3,B00191AEZK,"Stealth is a movie that is in French and Polish.  The guy lives in Switzerland where he speaks French, but finds out from his parents that his grandfather is from Poland.  However, the family knows very little about his grandfather because he left his pregnant grandmother before his father was born.  From this information, the main character Lionel, who is a writer of fiction or semi-fiction, decides to learn how to speak Polish and to gain back parts of his heritage.

What I like about this film is that it's not about they guy being gay, nor about his gay situation.  Gay has nothing to do with the plot.  The movie is simply about a guy who wants to re-connect with his heritage because as a kid he never knew that he was partly Polish being that his grandfather is Polish.  It just so happens that this guy is gay.  It's not a gay movie about him being gay.  He has a relationship with a guy which the family doesn't have an issue with, but he meets a woman from Poland who is seeking legal papers to live in Switzerland.  Out of sympathy he offers to marry this Polish woman.  However, his sister doesn't like the idea and decides to steal him away from everyone and heads to Poland together in search of the story behind the grandfather, so that the brother can settle his mind about his heritage.  This movie made me think about my own heritage.

What I don't like about this movie is there are so many unexplained parts in the movie.  He and his sister left everyone behind, and we know nothing of what happens to the immigrant Polish woman who Lionel was going to marry.  At the end of the movie, the sister decides to stay in Poland with no explanation as to why she wanted to remain in Poland.  She's pregnant, but there is no explanation as to whether her husband will ever find out and what his reaction would be.  Lionel, who works for a radio station, took the company car to Poland, but it is stolen and no where do they show this was reported to the police.  Why? What ever happen to Lionel's boyfriend?  Does Lionel return to him?  Lots of strange moments in the movie that makes no sense.",1498176000,,2112,4.380462724935732
8271563,4,B00191AEZK,"Its like the summary is a lie. He is not openly gay and his family is not understanding except for the sister who in the beginning calls him out on his bull. I felt incredibly bad about what happened when the polish girl came to live with Lionel and Serge especially when Lionel practically said he was bored with serge when all he was doing was trying to get his attention and keep their relationship. While I hated it for the sole purpose of the false summary and Lionel's horrid treatment of his ""boyfriend"" the last half of the movie was rather funny and in a way heart warming. I still feel Lionel is a jerk that can't actually come to terms with himself if he can't even let a ""guest"" see him loving on his boyfriend, and I wish Serge finds someone better and worth his love.",1483920000,,781,4.283783783783784

8271567,5,B00191AEZK,"a little slow at the beinning, but it turns both hilarious and charming into the film.  Very very funny, clever dialogue too.  The queer stuff is almost incidental, it's really about a story-telling poet who happens to be queer - with a a couple of love scenes.  I liked it a lot.",1463011200,,280,4.346153846153846

8271569,2,B00191AEZK,"The description is what caught my interest to watch this film.  Within the first 27 minutes I found the description of the film unbelievable.  It states Lionel  is a happy gay man that has an open minded family that accepts his lover. However,  in the opening scene Lionel is unable to hold hands with his lover in front of this accepting family. I found a man uncomfortable with his sexuality. When Lionel talks with his sister about marriage to Ewa he says not to tell his mother because she will think hes in love with a woman!  When he invites Ewa to stay with him and Serge, they are not to let on that they are in a relationship. Im not saying this couldn't happen but for me a bit unbelievable and I lost my interest in the story.",1446854400,9,737,4.273381294964029
