861767,4,6304354487,"The 3rd volume of the Zatoichi series of movies continues where the last one left off.  Zatoichi returns home and meets up with his old sensei. However, his homecoming is marred by the fact that the brother of one of the men Zatoichi had to kill previously wants revenge.  To make matters worse, his sensei's sister wishes to marry Zatoichi, but the way of the sword may prove to be greater than love.

The translation quality of the third volume is improved over the previous two movies.  As such, some Japanese honorifics make it into the subtitles and rather than translate Japanese words for brother/sister into character names, they are translated as brother/sister.  So that's a big improvement.  I hope this trend continues in the next movies.

As for the movie, it is another good one.  I'm normally not a fan of old movies, but there is just something about this samurai series that I really enjoy.  Shintarou Katsu does a fantastic job as Zatoichi.  The sword work is really something to see.

Bottom line: I really recommend this title for fans of samurai anime titles or who are interested in Japanese culture.  If you are looking for a pretty good action/adventure flick with a bit of romance (similar to old American westerns), then this may be the title for you.",1097539200,35,1277,4.728506787330317
861768,4,6304354487,"Man what can I say. This is the fourth Zatoichi film I have ordered and it was just as good as the others. In this one he meets his old fencing teacher, but hey I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone. Suffice it to say these are great movies. Well acted and filmed with some incredible choreography in the sword fights. If you like martial arts films or like westerns where a lone guy brings justice to the wicked you will like these movies.
And these movies are well made they are not those cheap chinese kung fu flicks, but well produced and acted films. They are Japanese films and of much higher quality. Try one you will like it.",1004227200,13,637,4.229508196721311

I thought that Shintaro Katsu was not only showing action in his Zatoichi role, but also a bit of comedy.  Vol. 3 is from his TV series.  I was a little disappointed, when I viewed a couple of the episodes in this, as some things were quite familiar.  I came to realize that a couple of his movies were cut to fit the one hour TV format, as I have his entire collection on DVD.  The two that I am referring to are the one with the sumo wrestler and the one with the released prisoner who had a winning lottery ticket.",1348272000,,682,4.136363636363637
861972,5,6304354487,Like the title said no such thing as a bad Zatoichi movie. I think it's the first color episode they made and it kind of gives you the back story of where he learned to use his sword. Then his teacher comes into the plot helping out the Tengue of Mito gang. The best scene is at the end where he takes on the Tengue gang. But enough said like all the old Zatoichi series it's a winner.,1348099200,,385,3.948717948717949
861973,5,6304354487,"The term ""zato"" indicates a man who is of the status of a blind itinerant masseur who travels from town to town giving massages as a way to make a living. It is a sub-division of the outcaste hinin (""non-human"") caste. The Zato Ichi films feature a man of this status who also has become highly skilled as a swordsman. He carries his sword hidden in a cane because it was against the law of the time for such a man to carry and use a sword. His given name is Ichi, thus ""Zato Ichi"". He is one of the few feudal outcaste characters in a leading role in a film and TV series.

In this third film of the series, Ichi returns to visit with the sensei who had been his instructor in the art of the sword. The sensei had once been a samurai in a clan but is now a ronin who runs a free-lance school to teach swordsmanship. He lives with his sister. Once Ichi arrives, the sensei tries to shame his students by having Ichi give a demonstration of his quick-draw techniques. It appears that the sensei had taught Ichi as a sort of experiment i.e. ""I can teach even a blind outcaste masseur to be a sword expert.""  He views Ichi as a sort of novelty, not as a human being with human feelings; after all, Ichi does belong to the ""non-human"" caste.

But Ichi is a human being. And so is the sensei's sister. She and Ichi develop a deep love relationship with each other. Ichi considers that perhaps it might be possible for him be able to stop his wanderings and settle down with the sister as husband and wife in a peaceful existence. However, when Ichi approaches the sensei with the idea of marrying his sister, the sensei bristles with contempt -- who does Ichi think that he is? It's one thing for the sensei to have taught Ichi sword skills as a sort of novel experiment. But for someone like Ichi, an outcaste blind masseur, to believe that he can actually wed his sister, who is of samurai lineage -- that is unthinkable in the sensei's view.  And so Ichi must leave town.

Later on, after various plot twists, the inevitable happens and Zato Ichi faces his sensei in a final duel. The duel is hard-fought between two swordsmen of almost equal ability. But in the end, it is Ichi, the blind masseur, who is the victor, having slain his former sensei. Ichi cannot stay and marry the sister, as the weight of society's prohibitions and also the course of his own wandering life will not allow it. So Ichi continues once more on his journeys.",1325203200,,2436,4.333333333333333
861974,5,6304354487,The DVDs came in very quickly and were able to be given as an Xmas gift as hoped. The Videos are of good quality and content. This series is as good as the full length movies and I would readily recommend them to any Zatoichi fans.,1264377600,,231,4.043478260869565
861975,3,6304354487,"This is the 3rd episode in the Zatoichi series and the first to be done in color.  Let me start by saying the color photography is just gorgeous, with light, shadow and pastellish color bringing the kind of grace and archaic beauty you'd expect from a rural and rustic Samurai era Japan.  On the con side, of the 4 Zatoichi films I've seen so far, this was the slowest.  Maybe I'm just losing interest in the formula, but it took a very long time for the plot to become established; the silences and spaces within scenes last an achingly long time.  Even at 90 minutes I nearly didn't finish this one.  Zatoichi films are great, but you've sometimes got to be in a Zen kind of mood I suppose, ready to savor a cup of green tea or sit still and unmoving before a wall for prolonged periods.",1262649600,,789,4.304054054054054

861977,4,6304354487,"The Zatoichi television series ran for over 5 years, from 1974-1979. And with 100 episodes planned, this first season of 26 episodes will give fans of the Zatoichi films more of the delightful character of Ichi to enjoy. As with some of the other episodes in the first six volumes, there are some episodes that are directly from the film series: Some that are slightly different, and this Volume 3 is no exception. However, there are also some totally different plots in many of them, and this particular volume is a great addition to your Ichi collection. I rate this volume [Stars: 4.5]. The episodes are as follows:

#10: ""THE SUMO WRESTLER WHO FOUND HIS HOME."" Very good drama, and ending action by Ichi highlight this excellent episode. Zatoichi encounters a young man who is about to kill himself. Moreover, he is an orphan and Ichi sympathizes with the young man. That is until the young man [who is a sumo wrestler] tags along and follows Ichi. To the irritation of Ichi, the young sumo wrestler follows Ichi wherever he goes. In the background of this episode, there is a Ronin, who has been following Ichi. His name is Yaturo Soma, and he is good with the sword. However, Ichi discovers something about this young sumo wrestlers past and resolves to help him. The ending action is superb. There are lots of ending action scenes with Ichi--more than usual for the TV series. I liked this episode quite a lot. [Stars: 5+]

#11: ""THE WHIRLWIND OF KISOJI MOUNTAIN."" The beginning transfer on this episode is not good, but it does get better. Also, this is one of those episodes that culls a bit from the Motion Picture films. The episode opens with Ichi being accused of stealing a horse, and then thrown in jail. At the same time, a group of assassins are attempting to kill Ichi. Further enhancing this episode, is a side narrative with a doctor who has come to help the villagers while on his search for annual plants to use for medicines. Moreover, a yakuza boss has hired a marksman to kill Ichi, and here this episode will intersect with doctor, Ichi, and the gunmen. The film has a great ending with Ichi's swordplay in action. [Stars: 5]

#12: ""HUMANITY AND JUSTICE."" Good location shots highlight this particular episode. The scenery is beautiful. This is a very different episode in regards to the TV series, and the films. However, there are similarities, not too much though, to ""Zatoichi #12: Zatoichi and the Chess Expert."" This episode finds a female yakuza out to avenge the death of her father. In doing so, she dresses as a man, and acts like one. However, Ichi knows that she is a female. As this young woman seeks her vengeance, it is up to Ichi to save her. There are some funny element thrown into this particular episode--especially with boss Gonzo. All in all, a very good episode and a humorous and welcome relief to the TV series. However, there is plenty of ending action by Ichi, and he is incredibly quick with the cane sword. [Stars: 4.5]

#13: ""THE 1,000 RYO RAFFLE."" This is an interesting episode, and stars the young Yoshio Harada as a recently released prisoner. Shinsuke (Yoshio Harada) has come to seek vengeance on those who have wronged him. Ichi helps him in the beginning, and Shinsuke gives Ichi a raffle ticket. Unknown to either, it is a winning 1,000 ryo lottery ticket. Ichi and Shinsuke have departed ways, therefore, Ichi seeks this former prison inmate out. Going to Shinsuke's seaside village. Yet, Shinsuke does not want the money. He has a code of honor, and this code will not allow him to accept it. For he has told Ichi that he has given it way. Moreover, he has come back to seek vengeance. The new boss is not an honorable man, and it is a woman that Shinsuke seeks out--and that goes for the men who wronged him. Once again Ichi come to the rescue. It was good to see Yoshio Harada in this episode, who would also team up later in his career with Ichi in the film ""Ronin Gai."" Not a great episode, but entertaining nonetheless, with the predicable Ichi sword slashing ending. [Stars: 3.5]",1188864000,14,4052,4.615811373092926
861978,5,6304354487,"This 3rd entry of the Zatoichi series is also the first color episode. It is also a classic, in my opinion. This film opens up with a tie-in to the 2nd Zatoichi episode. Zatoichi has killed Kenbei [in episode #2], and Kenbei's loyalists are out to avenge the death of their boss by seeking to kill Ichi. Kenbei's brother is the leader of these avenging loyalist's, and in a twist, he is an ethical member of the yakuza. He believes in the Bushido code. Quite a departure from the usual ""bad-guys"" Ichi runs into.

Also in this episode is Ichi's sensei, Banno: The man who taught Zatoichi his skills. However, the sensei is a changed man. This is not the honorable sensei and mentor that Ichi recalls. Banno has lost whatever honor he once had; and his interaction with Ichi is sad to watch. Ironically, the yakuza after him have more honor than Ichi's former mentor. Quite a switch from the usual Zatoichi fare. Tokuzo Tanaka, who directed this film, did an outstanding job with the characters in this film. Moreover, Banno's sister, Yayoi, has fallen in love with Ichi. And Ichi loves her.

Therefore, Ichi ask's his former sensei for her hand in marriage. This causes resentment with Banno, who scoffs at Ichi. Truly a sad episode for Ichi. Banno, the antagonist in the film, and Ichi, the protagonist will clash. But will it lead to a sword duel? And what about the ethical and upstanding brother of Kenbei? Will he duel Ichi? Or will he forgive the blind swordsman? This film is an outstanding Zatoichi episode. Will Yayoi and Ichi stay together?

Banno betrays everyone around him, and as a master-swordsman who trains pupils in this episode: they too are used as objects to be discarded at the whim of this most dishonorable man. One of the pupils in particular is Kingo. The betrayal Banno mete's out to this pupil is the final straw for Ichi. The cane-sword weilding  Ichi will tolerate no more. It is time for action. The entire film is great. Cinematography, music, colors, and the plot. A truly outstanding film. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1157328000,,2055,4.7
