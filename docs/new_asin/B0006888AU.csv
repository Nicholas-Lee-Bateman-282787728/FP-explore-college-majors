8040146,4,B0006888AU,I used this on my computer & placed outside as a Halloween prop this year.  Hooked up to some decent sounding speakers.  The trick or treaters young and old seemed to have been entertained by it.  Got lots of positive comments.,1383436800,,227,4.487804878048781

8040148,1,B0006888AU,"Glad I did not pay full retail for these products, the previews looked pretty good but when you actually get the product the majority of it is pretty lame. Unless you like dumb and stupid I would not recommend these Big Scream products.",1258156800,2,236,4.511627906976744
8040149,3,B0006888AU,"Basically  this DVD is a good attrempt at putting scary faces on a tv screen. There are at least 10 different scary characters. Each of them has around 5 to 8 different little snipets. It is not too scary for small ones. I have a 6 yr girl, I had to sit with her through the video the first time and after that she was fine.
I am not happy with the menu options. If they would allow you to just select individual video clips, like chapters then I feel that this Halloween decoration tool would have been better utilized. Basically you have to watch the entire video from beginning to end and repeat the whole dvd if you are using it for a tv decoration.

Personally I am going to attempt to load it into my computer and cut it up into pieces and recreate it back to dvd and then use it as a Halloween prop.",1255737600,,806,4.094936708860759
8040150,5,B0006888AU,"We've used the Big Scream TV DVD's for a couple of adult Halloween parties and I love them.  They run on a continuous loop so there's no need to replay them.  The faces are suitable of children and funny enough for adults.
I'm sure that when this DVD was made LCD TV's were very expensive - that's why the set up recommends smaller TV's that are not as heavy.  Of course these days LCD TV are more common and bigger TV's are lighter making them easier to use for this special effect.  We use a 40 inch LCD screen to create a bigger `head'.
Whenever we've used this DVD during adult Halloween parties we always get many compliments from our friends.  For very little money you can get the most amazing special effect that everyone will enjoy. It's worth every penny!",1191801600,,765,4.397163120567376
8040151,2,B0006888AU,"Specifically ""The DVD is programmed to loop indefinitely so your display can go on uninterrupted all night!""

This is not true. The heads in the DVD are random and change constantly.  In order to play the video continuously it requires that the users DVD player have a repeat feature otherwise it will return to the menu screen when complete.

Additionally, if someone wanted only a Clown face you would need to manually input several chapters and have it skip over the remaining faces/chapters.  Instead of the pumpkin face appearing for several minutes, and then the clown face for several minutes, it jumps back and forth between all of the faces.  For instance, if someone wanted only a clown face they would need to program in several different chapters and leave off the remaining faces.

To illustrate, the first scene is a clown face for approx. 20 seconds, then to a pumpkin face, then to Frankenstein, and back to a clown again.  Then it moves on to a mad scientist, back to a clown, then a pumpkin.  Each face appearing for approx 15-20 second intervals.

Also keep in mind that for the effect to work the larger the tv used the better.  The video says to use smaller tv's that are easier to move around however the smaller the tv the smaller the image.  Using a 13"" tv as the video suggests leaves the image too small to view once set up.  A flat screen 19"" or 25"" is required to have the image appear life-size.

I own all three dvd's in this series and the result and description above is true for all of them.",1189987200,2,1524,4.498181818181818
