4962323,5,B0066E6PR6,Gordon Scott was one of our favorite Tarzans when my brothers and I were kids so we really enjoyed these movies.,1344384000,,112,4.380952380952381
4962324,5,B0066E6PR6,"This is a review of the Tarzan 6-pack. First off,let me say I love most of these old Tarzan films. Gordon Scott being my all time favorite. All 6 are great,although the last 2 are by far the best. The ad lists them as 1.77:1 this is not all  true. The first; Tarzan's hidden Jungle is 1.33:1. The next 3 all look to be cropped versions of either a previous pan & scan print or  a 1.85:1 crop. In the case of the last 2(greatest adventure,the magnificent)they must be from a slightly cropped 1.85:1 print.
 Now all that being said,they all are very good when it comes to picture and sound. To me they are worth the price. You get all 5 films and the TV series turned into a movie(Tarzan & the Trappers) They are kinda pricey buying 1 at a time, the 6 pack is a better deal.",1338768000,4,772,4.133333333333334
4962325,5,B0066E6PR6,"This is the third collection of Tarzan movies in my collection. Both the video and audio are excellent and would highly recommend it to any one who enjoys the adventures of Tarzan.  But to me Johnny Weismueller was the only Tarzan.  These videos have no extras, each episode is on its own disc and case.",1338163200,5,303,4.490909090909091
4962326,5,B0066E6PR6,"This collection from Warner Home Video gathers all six of Gordon Scott's Tarzan adventures. In my opinion, Scott was the last of the great movie Tarzans.  Scott portrayed Tarzan during five years of cinematic transition that evolved from the more familiar Tarzan fare of greedy, khaki-suited hunters (in 1955), to grittier Tarzan sagas featuring roaming bloodthirsty jungle terrorists (in 1960).

It is much less expensive to purchase this set than to buy the Gordon Scott Tarzan titles individually. These are DVD-R discs that do not have any ""extras."" However, the picture quality on each film in very sharp and the sound is excellent.

With these DVD-R discs, the viewer can simply hit the ""play"" button on the remote and watch each film all the way through. Also, the films are divided into ""chapters"" of ten minutes each. The menu page does not list the chapters by number or title, but the viewer can proceed through a film by hitting the ""next"" or ""previous"" buttons on the DVD remote control.

Also, since these are specially produced DVD-R discs by Warner Home Video, they are made to play in DVD players only and are not designed to play in computers and some other playback devices. I would advise anyone who might plan to play these movies in something other that the standard DVD player, to consult the WB website or call WB customer service before purchasing.

In this set, the viewer will find these titles:  Tarzan's Hidden Jungle (1955); Tarzan and the Lost Safari (1956); Tarzan and the Trappers (1958); Tarzan's Fight For Life (1958); Tarzan's Greatest Adventure (1959); Tarzan the Magnificent (1960).

And this set also features the lovely and talented Eve Brent who, in my opinion, was the last great movie Jane.  So for a box full of action-packed jungle adventures, ""The Gordon Scott Tarzan Collection"" is a sure bet.",1329609600,36,1840,4.912903225806452

4962347,2,B0066E6PR6,"It's nice to have all the Gordon Scott Tarzan movies available as a set (I think Gordon Scott was the best Tarzan).
The quality of the DVDs are disappointing. NONE of the films have been mastered and it shows. Some, as mentioned, have been poorly cropped.  At this cost it's a rip-off. But this is the only way you can get all the Gordon Scott Tarzan movies. Even the last three films which are better than the first 3 in the set suffer from original letterboxing format as issued.  I had some DVD-Rs I obtained from a non WB release, and the letterboxing and quality was terrific.  Unfortunately you can no longer obtain these, which is sad. There is no reason that WB could not have done a remastering of the films and present them in their proper ratio presentation.  If WB offered this set at $15.00 it would still be too much. Shame on WB. If they want to charge these prices they should be wiling to present a better offering.",1470355200,11,932,4.401162790697675

4962394,5,B0066E6PR6,"My husband got these for Christmas from his brother so he is writing this review on my account!. I have been a Tarzan fan since I can ever remember! Gordon Scott as Tarzan was probaly one of the best ones. Rating #2 on my chart!! These are some of the best movies of the later ones! The only problem was that Tarzan got to modern with his language in the later 2 movies and got away from the Jungle way of talking! I can't see Tarzan using guns or handgrenades!!! Only a knife and elephants!!

I really like the fact that they are bringing back the old favorates and the good ones at that!!! NO NUDITY AND SEX all the time!!
Sometimes Less is MORE!!!

If you are a Tarzan fan then you must have this set for your collection!!!",1419552000,2,726,4.178571428571429

4962415,5,B0066E6PR6,"As I think Gordon Scott was the best Tarzan, this 6 film set is excellent.

4962421,5,B0066E6PR6,The quality of the DVDs was excellent and it was great fun to take a trip back in time to see these jungle pictures.  Tarzan the Magnificent is probably one of the best if not the best of the Tarzan series. Tarzan's Fight for Life was good as well; seeing a very young Sean Connery and Anthony Quayle added a great deal to the picture. Interesting to see Tarzan's language capability increase so much in just a few years.,1352419200,5,421,4.329113924050633
4962422,5,B0066E6PR6,"I, like a lot of people, believe that Gordon Scott personified Tarzan like Edgar
Rice Burroughs imagined him to be. I have had most of his movies on tape for years
and I welcome this boxset with open arms, but I wish his other movies would come
to dvd also as they are worth watching.

My two favourites in this boxset are ""Tarzan's Fight for Life"" and ""Tarzan's
Greatest Adventure"". If it wasn't for one sceen in ""Tarzan and the Lost Safari""
it would be included also. These two movies show that Tarzan can be as loving (if
not more so) as civilized people, and yet, meter out justice to anyone who demands
the ultimate price for disobeying the law.

""Tarzan's Hidden Jungle"" is the first Tarzan movie for Gordon Scott, and sees
Tarzan saving a baby elephant after illegal hunters try to shoot it, but he has
to get white man's medicine off a jungle vet and his assistant to cure it. Later
the trappers, posing as a film crew, convince the doctor to take them into
forbidden native land unknowingly to drive the animals out so they can kill them.
The doctor and his assistant are lined up for the execution (lion style), but
Tarzan is able to get the animals back, depriving the lions of a meal. It is not
a bad movie for his first shot at the role.

""Tarzan and the Lost Safari"" sees Tarzan leading a group of people across the
African plains after they crash their aeroplane in Opar country. On their way to
Kairobi there is plenty of action from both the natives and the safari party as
well. What makes this a non-favourite is a silly swimming scene with Diana and
Tarzan while on a break from their travels. Tarzan should have known better as it
was native country, and wild animals were about. Despite this one hiccup, it is a
great movie and I enjoyed it.

""Tarzan and the Lost Trappers"" starts with Tarzan putting Sikes' brother behind
bars for illegal hunting in King Tyana's land. Sikes decides to hunt Tarzan for
doing so, but he is an arrogant, egotistical, maniac who thinks he is better
than Tarzan, who was born in the very jungle he is going to hunt him. To me this
is laughable because you can not track someone who can swing through trees and
leave no trace. Sikes is too arrogant to understand this.

The rest of the movie is about the lost city of Sarbo although they try to track
Tarzan on the way. Sikes is in camp one night bragging about how great a hunter
he is while Tarzan is in the bushes listening. Tarzan roles one of the natives
he captured into camp and everyone goes crazy except Sikes, who thinks he is at
a dinner party and nothing can harm him. When they reach Sarbo Tarzan picks off
the native guards Sikes puts in place. After the hunters are trapped within the
city, Tarzan takes care of them in the only they understand. At the end, Cheeta
destorys Tarzan's hope for a surprise that Jane's prepared for everyone. He eats
the scrambled eggs dish by eating the whole lot, and without table manners also.

In ""Tarzan's Fight for Life"" Tarzan returns with eggs for dinner, but he and
Jane go for a swim before eating. They are lying in a alcove talking about their
life together like two people totally in love with each other. Then Jane gets
cramps in the side suddenly, and it is a life and death race to the doctor in a
canoe that Boy as made. On the way there are rapids and a python to contend with.

While Jane is recovering from an operation the natives get restless as their
young king is ill. The witch doctor makes one of the natives try to kill Jane,
but is interrupted by Boy and Cheeta. Later Tarzan is captured by the natives so
the witch doctor can use his heart to cure the young king. Tarzan escapes to save
the king from the mad witch doctor. The witch doctor drinks some untreated
medicine he obtained from the white doctor by stealth, killing himself.

Eve Brent was cast perfectly for her role as Jane, and I can not imagine someone
else. It is as if she was born just so she could do this movie.

At the start of ""Tarzan's Greatest Adventure"" Slade and a few others rob a village
of some gelignite, killing two men in the process. Tarzan is sleeping and is
startled by a faint noise. Finding out about the raid, he goes to find out who is
responsible. When Slade's name is mentioned, he knows something has to be done, or
his home will not be worth living in. He does not need a funeral to remind him of
his very good friend, so he is off to rid the jungle of this menace.

While canoeing along the river he has to save Angie after she crashes her plane in
the river, so she has to accompany Tarzan on his adventure. Later he traps Slade
and his gang on the river and is nearly killed by some gelignite, but Angie comes
to the rescue, helping him through this crisis. Recovering, Tarzan is off with a
vengence. In the process of the story one disappears in quicksand, one gets
heartburn from an arrow, one disappears down a mine hole, a woman disappears down
a lions throat, and Slade is left to Tarzan.

Angie is returning to civilization in Slade's boat as Tarzan goes off after Slade.
The showdown between Tarzan and Slade is high up on a waterfall, but there is no
match between Tarzan's jungle-bread strength and Slade's rifle, so it is down to
a fist fight, and again there is no match. Slade ends up with back trouble when
he falls on some rocks at the bottom of the waterfall, so with the death of Slade
the victory cry of the Great Apes rings out across the African plains. His home
is once again safe to live in.

The last movie is ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" and sees Tarzan escorting Coy Banton,
one of the Banton clan (dad and four sons) to jail in Kairobi, after they rob a
post office and killing a few people. The inspector escorting Coy to prison is
killed by the Bantons, so Tarzan takes over the job as the inspector was his good
friend. The riverboat is destroyed near Mantu to stop Tarzan, so it is a journey
across the African plain with five people off the riverboat.

The trip is a hard slog for the five people while they are dogged by the Bantons,
swamps, quicksand, wild animals, death and a native woman, who is pregnant, is
saved by an ex-doctor in the party. Coy seduces one of the women into releasing
him and is later a meal for a lioness. Eventually, all the Bantons are killed
except for Coy, so, the showdown between Tarzan and Coy is a fight between
muscle and determination. The fight is short and not pretty, but Tarzan wins the
day.

With the end of this movie Gordon Scott's role came to an end, which I thought
was a shame, but it had to happen some day, I guess. He went on to make some
good movies, and was my hero, so I hope to meet him in the great beyond, standing
next to the other great man, Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of the greatest
superhero of them all TARZAN.",1350086400,2,6775,4.332807570977918
