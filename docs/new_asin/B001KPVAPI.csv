8315790,4,B001KPVAPI,"The story was intense and could have happened to any number of my friends and family. The thought of being stuck in such a horrible place with a crazy justice system was the worst.
I loved Mercedes and her fierce loyalty to her sister.
I will forever weigh my baggage before surrendering it and some how get that weight authorized.
I'm still a romantic and don't believe Chappelle knew. Would love to see her released immediately.",1378857600,,430,4.671052631578948
8315791,5,B001KPVAPI,"There is much breaking news in relation to this gross miscarriage of justice, including a brand new documentary that's already on the can - and set to be released before the end of 2011.

8315792,5,B001KPVAPI,"I'm not a huge fan of documentaries, but this one grabbed on to me and won't let go.  I first saw it about 2-3 years ago, and it still entertains me each time I watch it.
The film follows an attractive young Australian woman through her legal ordeal after being caught with several pounds of ganja in an airport in Bali.  She was on a trip with her family to visit relatives, and vacation.
Several interesting characters introduce themselves into the mix, some to offer genuine help, some to attempt to capitalize on the limelight surrounding this high profile case.

I must say that the film does a wonderful job of presenting information to the viewer in such a way that keeps you on an emotional rollercoaster.  Just when you think this poor girl is the victim of a set-up, you get a few bits of information that pull you back and make you think.

Her family is an interesting group of characters.  Her mother and sister express a pain throughout the film that seems to come through the camera and tug at your heart.  You begin to feel their frustration.
Her father, brother and neighbor seem to create more doubt with every word they speak.  The entire cost of the film is paid back to you 10 fold as you watch the awkward interview with her Dad at the end.  Just when you think you have the whole scenerio pinned down, they turn your mind upside-down and leave you in awe.

You will think about this film at work the next day, and weeks later.  You will cycle through the following emotions for her, in no particular order:  sympathy, pity, suspicion, attraction, disbelief, and mistrust.

Here are some personal opinions of mine.  I tried to resist giving my opinion but this thign sticks in your head and makes you express an opinion on her guilt and such:
-  The Bali legal system is portrayed as quite rough and indifferent in some parts.  But, considering the circus that must have existed around this I would consider it somewhat restrained...other than the length of sentence proposed.  Her lawyer is a gentle character that seems to have her heart into the case.
-  I don't trust her father, my opinion.  he has a wierd attitude through the whole thing.
-  My thoughts on innocence or guilt?  My mind keeps going back to the fact that the bag was the identical shape as the boogie board...admittedly her boogie board.  A coincidence too large to ignore.  And, her family's seemingly well rehersed explanation of the events the morning they left for the airport didn't help her.

Either way, there is no doubt the court in Bali decided to make an example of this woman.  Even if you assume guilt, the length of the sentence is appalling to anyone else in the free world.",1313712000,2,2682,4.549060542797495
8315793,4,B001KPVAPI,"Yes I have no doubt in my mind that she is innocent but any reasonable person would have to ask who is guilty?

First of all I don't believe for one second that the ten pounds of Marijuana was placed in the boogie-board bag by the baggage handlers at the airport, it had to be someone in her family that did it, no offense to anyone but we are talking about ten pounds here not half an ounce, keep in mind that the 10 pounds was placed in a plastic bag in the exact shape and size of the boogie-board, you really want to tell me this is a co-incidence? I don't think so.

Second business man Ron Bakir did more damage to Corbys case than anyone, he is nothing more than a greedy and selfish person who was desperate for attention, his claims of wanting to save Corby out of the goodness of his heart is laughable.

What angers me is the fact that business man Ron Bakir ran to the media and publicly called the Indonesian officials corrupt and accused one of the prosecutors in the case of trying to take a bribe in exchange for Corby's acquittal, I can safely say that Ron Bakir's selfish move pretty much sealed Corby's faith, I believe if he wasn't involved there would have been a big chance Corby would be free right now.

This is a heart breaking story and its easy to see why the case received so much attention from the press and people around the world.",1285459200,,1362,4.2471042471042475
8315794,5,B001KPVAPI,In my opinion everyone who travels needs to watch this documentary.  Heartbreaking and terrifying as you realise how vunerable you are when travelling.  In my opinion it was a circus of a trial and this girl is innocent.,1280966400,2,220,4.7631578947368425
8315795,3,B001KPVAPI,"Schapelle Corby is INNOCENT! I recently finished both Schapelle's book and Tony Wilson's and I wouldn't have even bought them hadn't I saw this doc and found out it was heavily edited from the original Network Nine broadcast Schapelle Corby: The Hidden Truth. BUT Ganja Queen and the original was slanted and made her team (with the exception of Erwin Sirigar) look like a true-blue fighting force and the Corby family like Outback trash.

I'm not Aussie, I know little about the culture- especially the bogans (Aussie rednecks) save for Eric Bana's hilarious character 'Poida' from Full Frontal- but this doc made the Corbys who are working-class bohemians seem like dumb bogans. I know Europeans love to go to Southeast Asia, and it's a tradition since they were once part of the European empires. My European relatives who have visited Thailand and Bali know that Brits and Aussies are the predominant expat and tourist groups, so the Corbys going there multiple times is nothing new- that's first off.

Second, her team was incompetent and corrupt. This is common in Southeast Asian governments. It made NO sense why weed was being brought INTO a country where it's grown and the police have arrangements with organized crime (as well as ministers and judges who get their cuts and bribes as well). Vasu Rasiah- ""Case coordinator"" in actuality is a Sri Lankan engineer and businessman who makes extra scratch ""helping"" foreigners in trouble. Robin Tampoe- Aussie/Sri Lankan defence solicitor is an untrustworthy ambulance chaser whose family more than likely knew Rasiah's family because they came from the same village. Lily Lubis- an inexperienced, corrupt crybaby who was more than likely sexually involved with Ron Bakir. The famous ""Mad"" Ron Bakir is an annoying con man looking to sell more TVs. He lied about footing the bill for the defence team (the Aussie government did that) and now is in financial trouble as well as having his brother on drug charges.

Thirdly, the media is uncontrollable in Southeast Asia. Journalism is nothing more than sensationalism in the region- but you probably won't find it in publications like the South China Morning Post (Hong Kong, SAR), foreign newspapers, the Wall Street Journal, and other financials (SE Asia is a financial hub despite its third world conditions). Schapelle being young (27 at the time), pretty, and white make it worse.

Fourthly, Indonesia is politically, economically, and culturally polarized. The dominant religion is Islam, after that is Buddhism, Hinduism, and a small Christian population. Indonesians couldn't profit regardless of their positions until a change of laws recently and the rich have gotten richer, a middle-class is developing, but the gap between rich and poor is staggering. In the last 20 years Islamic fundamentalim has been on the rise, and the government has to placate the mullahs and their followers so there won't be a coup or an uprising in order to continue their way of life (i.e. a sultanate complete with palaces, limos, and wives). They are also frightened of the US in the wake of 9/11 so those who side with radicals (for varying reasons) aren't ousted from power, end up in GITMO, or end up dead so they have to please us as well. Another point is that Indonesia has a misogynistic culture, sex is bad yet they have a thriving sex industry. A man can divorce/beat/murder/rape his wife and he will get a slap on the wrist as well as get better treatment in jail. A woman can kill the husband who is battering her and her children leaving them with nothing to eat and she will face life in prison if not execution.

This is a human rights abuse with an innocent person behind bars! FREE SCHAPELLE CORBY!!!",1250812800,,3715,4.9376
8315796,4,B001KPVAPI,"I agree with the other comment. This documentary is a must see because it unfolds as the situation unfolds, its not a retelling, it is filmed during her whole ordeal. I was also extremely shocked by everything in it and it truly changed my life. I have learned to appreciate things I have more and I am also ready to take action to help Schapelle. They have a website which you should check out also, which lets you know how to help. I am considering setting up some kind of action group to send letters to representatives, expand support, create awareness, get media coverage... something! Anyway, as you can see this had a profound affect on me and it will affect you too. I also agree that this movie does not tell the whole story. As horrifying as it is, there are still worse things they left out. You should watch this, if anything, to open your eyes to something you would not think possible... to realize that something unimaginable actually happened to someone that so many of us can relate to.",1249776000,,1003,4.516483516483516
