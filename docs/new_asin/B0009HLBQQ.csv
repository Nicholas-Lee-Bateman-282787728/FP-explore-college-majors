2290751,5,B0009HLBQQ,"I used to love Phil of the Future. Looking back these shows used to be so awesome and nothing could top them. Now that I'm older and watching them again, all I can think is 'Wow this is so cheesy' haha but I still love it.",1386633600,,222,3.847826086956522

2290753,5,B0009HLBQQ,"Phil of the Future a smart and funny Disney series, cancelled way before its time.

The episodes on this DVD are:

""My Way""
""Age Before Beauty""
""Double Trouble""
""Team Diffy""

I wish Disney would release a complete series, but until then us fans only have this DVD release and the episode ""Christmas Break"" as an extra on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-Channel-Holiday/dp/B0009OUB2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney Channel Holiday</a>",1345852800,7,490,6.746031746031746
2290754,5,B0009HLBQQ,"Phil of the Future: Gadgets and Gizmos is a 2005 Disney DVD compilation of four episodes of the classic Disney Channel Saturday morning sitcom. Phil Diffy is a teenager from the year 2121 who accidentally traveled to 2005 with his mom, dad, and his mean little sister Pim. While in the present, Phil made friends with Keely Teslow, a teenaged girl who only knows the Diffy family's secret. The fun only gets better with Curtis, a caveman who lives with the Diffys who always get in trouble. The special features includes audio commentary by Ricky Ullmann(Phil Diffy)as well as a 2121 cyber-catalogue and sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like That's So Raven, Lady and The Tramp and Valiant. Phil of the Future is one of the best classic Disney Channel shows ever and is on DVD you can enjoy antics of the Diffys whenever you like. :)",1345075200,3,843,4.6644295302013425
2290755,5,B0009HLBQQ,"Phil of the Future was my absolute favorite show! The puns, facial expressions, and sound effects make the show hilarious! I'm so glad I bought this DVD so I can watch it anywhere. If only it had more than 4 episodes.",1335052800,2,217,4.317073170731708
2290756,5,B0009HLBQQ,The DVD was in great condition when I got it.  I was satisfied with how Amazon had shipped it.  I really enjoyed watching the DVD a lot especially since Phil of the future is not on TV anymore.  I am hoping that some day the whole series will come out on DVD.,1296432000,2,259,3.9423076923076925
2290757,5,B0009HLBQQ,"I absolutely love this show and I could watch it over and over. I own this DVD and it is a good show, but it only includes 4 episodes and it cost $15, you're better off buy the whole series on iOffer for $25 or something. But this show is amazing and I absoultely love it and an official complete series dvd must be released this instant!",1294358400,,338,4.059701492537314
2290758,5,B0009HLBQQ,"I saw this show on abc in the morning when they play disney channel shows early in the morning and loved it.  This is my favorite Disney Channel show next to ""Hannah Montana.""  Ricky Ullman is so talented. I can't believe this show got canceled. I wish they would release the dvd of it so we can rent it on dvd! Come on Disney what's going on!",1183852800,3,343,4.104477611940299
2290759,4,B0009HLBQQ,"I would have like more episodes than this.  But, at least it's something.  Maybe at some point they will release it by season or release the complete series onto dvd.

And why did the show get canceled so soon?  It was a great show.

Maybe they will still make a movie.

Here's an idea for one:

A few years later for both Phil and Keely in their respective times (the show has been off the year a few years). Phil comes back to be with Keely.  Maybe the future has been messed up since they got back because by going back to the future they changed it.  Because Phil and Keely were supposed to get married and have a bunch of kids and do other stuff that no longer happened cause Phil left.  Maybe it took a few years to escape the future and return to Keely.  Maybe Phil has to win her back cause she's dating someone else by then.",1180915200,2,833,4.111801242236025
2290760,5,B0009HLBQQ,"A friend of mine named annonymous_man recently submitted a review on this DVD and about the show Phil of The Future. I would also like to express my interest in this great show. Phil Of The Future is an awesome Disney Channel show it is a shame they canceled its production after 2 seasons they should have at least made a POTF Movie.

In any case, I hope they release more POTF DVDs in future with some season 2 episodes also.

Indeed Phil Of The Future is a comedy ahead of its time!",1140566400,6,485,4.204301075268817
2290761,5,B0009HLBQQ,"Phil Of The Future is my second favorite show right now on Disney Channel it's too bad they canceled production of the series after season 2. Oh well they still made 2 great seasons and this DVD is a must buy for the ultimate POTF fan - I don't own it yet but plan to eventually.

In the meantime I watch Phil of The Future on Disney Channel. Hopefully, they'll release more POTF DVDs.",1140566400,6,385,4.202702702702703
2290762,3,B0009HLBQQ,"This dvd isn't too bad, I'm not really into POTF but I run a fansite on Amy Bruckner [amy-bruckner.net] and so I got the dvd to make caps and will get another DVD if Disney brings it out.

The only problem I have with it is it's only got 4 episodes..why on earth didn't they release all of Season 1? probably because they knew they could get more money for them if they do it bit by bit.",1129248000,3,387,3.9615384615384617
2290763,5,B0009HLBQQ,"I love the show Phil of the Future, and I'm so glad that they have made a DVD of some of the episodes.  Phil is one of my favorite shows ever...it's hilarious!  Phil now shows from Monday-Friday at 6:30 PM/5:30 central.  This is definitely a good collection of funny, good episodes plus a brand-new bonus episode.  I disagree with the voter below that people aren't tuning in to see Curtis the Caveman.  Curtis is hilarious, and he's what makes the show really unique.  (I do MAINLY tune in to watch Phil and Keely though.)  Bloopers would be something good to add, because they always help viewers to get a good laugh.  Other than that, this is a great collection of episodes, and Phil of the Future is a great show worth watching at least occasionally.",1127606400,4,754,4.533333333333333
2290764,4,B0009HLBQQ,"First of all I love the show and any nitpick I have is out of love. That being said this DVD is a good introudction to POTF for any people that haven't seen it. However this DVD is a dissapointment to big fans of POTF. Why?

1. The commentary should have contained Ricky Ullman AND Alyson Michalka? Why? With all due respect to Pim most people watch POTF because they are Pheely shippers. So it's just natural for Ricky and Alyson do the commentary together instead of Ricky by himself.

2. I know Disney isn't big on chronological order but couldn't they at least have thrown in the pilot?

3. Very little extras.

My suggestion is for Disney to go straight to the superb season 2 episodes for the next DVD release. Get a nice cover shot of Keely and Phil. Make sure to have a Alyson Michalka-Ricky Ullman commentary on a very Pheely episode like Virtu-Date or Get Ready to Go-Go. Include a whole bunch of bloopers. This dosen't seem like too much to ask. Know your fanbase Disney Channel, POTF fans aren't tuning in for Curtis the Caveman.",1125532800,19,1041,4.463157894736842
2290765,5,B0009HLBQQ,"Well I just got the DVD last Saturday Night as I pre order it at Amazon.com on 14 August 2005. Well, after seeing the first two epsiode which was ""Double Trouble"" and ""Age Before Beauty"", I found out that it was great comedy show! In Singapore, this TV Series have not been shown yet. I was very curious of this TV Series ever since I knew about about ALY and AJ at Popgeneration. Com. Then I went to this website called ""Aylsonmichalka.org"" where there got alot of Phil Of The Future pictures that I printed out. Well, that the whole story of how I knew Disney's Phil Of The Future. When I surf Amazon. Com and found out that there is a Phil Of The Future DVD, I quickly asked my friends to help me to order it! Yeah!, I am a BIG Lizzie McGuire fan, so I think if there is a show to replace it, it have to be Phil Of The Future!!!  Ricky Ullman and Alyson Michalka Rock!!",1125273600,4,872,4.099415204678363
2290766,5,B0009HLBQQ,"Phil of the Future is one of Disney Channel's top rated shows about a guy (Phil) who gets stuck in 2005 from the year 2121.  The first season was pretty good, but the second season is even better.  The second season turns the focus to Phil and Keely being maybe more than best friends and turning their relationship into a more romantic one.  Remember to watch Phil of the Future weekends on Disney Channel at 6:30PM.",1124150400,7,417,4.4605263157894735
