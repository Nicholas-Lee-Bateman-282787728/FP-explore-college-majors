6730436,5,B00O9ZSKP4,This was a great tribute to Robin from his friends and co-stars. It gives you a good look at his history.,1416268800,3,105,4.0476190476190474
6730437,5,B00O9ZSKP4,"When Robin Williams died in August every network rushed to create a special to air that night or a day later. PBS took a bit more time  though not much. Documentary Director  Steven J. Boettcher had apparently already started a documentary about Williams or had footage of one of Williams last interviews in preparation of another episode of PBS Pioneers of Television series.  Boettcher gathered the interview footage and contacted show business folks close to Williams and compiled this loving  and often hilarious (thanks to Williams amazing comic talents) 55 minute show. It aired a few weeks after his death as a one-off, but thanks to PBS Home Video it will now be on home DVD for those who missed it (like me). I was provided with an advance copy to compile this review.

Id say that nearly half of the time is spent on Williams role on TVs Mork and Mindy (which ran four seasons. But that is some of the funniest material here. It was an offshoot from Happy Days and so Henry Winkler (The Fonz) gets to discuss working with Williams. And Mindy. Pam Dawber, tells some great on the set stories, especially about the fourth season when Jonathan Winters (seen her in interviews before his death) and Williams would improvise (the script just said Williams and Winters do shtick). Then the tribute moves on to his feature film career with clips from Good Will Hunting, Popeye, Mrs. Doubtfire and of course Good Morning Vietnam. We learn that Williams recorded nearly 10 hours of material as the deejay in Vietnam and only some was used. (Boy, would an outtakes DVD be wonderful!).

There are also brief comments from stand-up comics Paul Rodriguez, Louis Anderson and Pauly Shore.
Its a loving tribute and one that will make you laugh out loud (and hit the repeat button to catch some of the lightning- speed  jokes) and then, when it is over, say to yourself : Why is this comic genius gone.
There are no bonus materials on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6730460,5,B00O9ZSKP4,"This is a very well crafted film retrospect of the late, great Mr. Robin Williams.  You could tell right away how loved Mr. Williams was, still is, by his closest friends and family members.
I think the entire world was shocked to hear of his sudden passing last summer, when seemingly, all was right with the world.
The film is a truly loving tribute to Mr. Williams.

6730461,2,B00O9ZSKP4,"In the late 70's ROBIN WILLIAMS exploded gut busting laughter he created, He and Pam Dawber rocked for awhile.  The first three years Mork & Mindy was MUST SEE TV.  The antics were surprising and off the wall, The show had a heart as well I miss it.  Maybe it is too early to look back at Robin's being watching Robin Williams Remembered I wanted to see more of the high notes of his career.

8682856,5,B00O9ZSKP4,"XXXXX

Went to bed last night
With hair upon my chest,
I woke up this morning with
A couple of beautiful breasts.

You know Im changing.

The above comes from this documentary (an early skit with Joan Rivers called The Hormone Blues) that remembers the extraordinary life of actor and comedian Robin McLaurin Williams (July 1951 to Aug. 2014).

This documentary features highlights from Williams last full-length television interview, tributes from those who knew and worked with him closely, and clips from iconic moments throughout his career.

Williams shares stories about his first stand-up act, his desire to be a serious, dramatic actor, and his efforts to entertain U.S. troops overseas.

Although Robin Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he later became known for his acting in film roles of substance and serious drama.

Some of the people in this film include Louie Anderson, Paul Rodriguez, Whoopi Goldberg, Yakov Smirnoff, Jimmy Stewart, Richard Pryor, Henry Winkler, Pam Dawber, Johnathan Winters, and Jimmie Walker.

Some of Williams work included briefly in this documentary include Mork and Mindy, Dead Poets Society, Mrs. Doubtfire, Patch Adams, Good Will Hunting, Night at the Museum, Popeye, The World According to Garp, Moscow on the Hudson, Good Morning Vietnam, Awakenings, and One Hour Photo.

Finally, some say this documentary should have been longer.  Perhaps.  However, personally, I appreciate that it wasn't long and syrupy.

In conclusion, this documentary celebrates the life of the one-and-only Robin Williams.  I feel that the world has grown a little darker with his passing.

(2014; 55 min. excluding end credits, wide screen, 6 chapters;  PBS;  a Pioneers of Television special)
