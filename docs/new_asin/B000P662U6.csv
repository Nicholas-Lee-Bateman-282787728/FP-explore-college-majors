8189148,4,B000P662U6,"I had to watch this movie for a class on accessibility for my Masters degree. I was not sure what to expect before watching it. Even though it is very outdated, it is still informative.

I think the only reason I rated it a 4 is because the whole tone throughout the movie is monotone. The man conducting the interviews with the people with disabilities, speaks in the same tone throughout the whole movie. I would have been able enjoy it more if he would have shown some more enthusiasm himself.

For those people who want to get a better understanding of those people who live with disabilities, it is a good movie to watch because it will definitely raise your awareness of many issues. However, if you are looking for a Saturday night movie with friends, this may not be the best choice.",1484784000,,791,4.486111111111111
