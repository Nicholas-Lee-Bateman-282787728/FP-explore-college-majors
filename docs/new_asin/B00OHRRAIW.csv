8683702,5,B00OHRRAIW,"Bayer Mack has given us one of America's greatest untold stories. The documentary not only draws attention to the importance of Oscar Micheaux as a pioneering African-American filmmaker but as one of the most important Independent filmmakers, working completely outside the Hollywood system. Mack cleverly integrates scenes from Micheaux's films that parallel his own life. This story is truly inspiring to any working artist.",1431820800,9,426,5.671875
