4235882,4,B003ZVL0V4,"I bought the Deluxe version of this DVD and MAN... What a show! The only bands who lacked were Megadeth and Anthrax... Dave Mustaine's vocals were ONCE AGAIN ridiculously overdubbed just like in their Rust In Peace Live DVD. Stuff like that really bugs me. We have recordings of the satellite broadcast all over YouTube and Dave's vocals sound NOTHING like that on this DVD and it's EXTREMELY obvious. Anthrax were kinda boring but it made them watchable due to Joey Belladona's triumphant return! \m/ Metallica's performance was bad ass but the way they mixed their set was HORRIBLE. The hi-hats and cymbals are too loud, the snare, bass drums, and toms are too low and they get buried by the guitars. The bass wasn't loud enough either. But it was a great set with classics such as Blackened and Hit The Lights, which made it ALL worthwile. Now, the MIGHTY SLAYER were the best out of the 4 and beat Metallica only because of their aggression and a good mix. I liked the DVD but there are some issues on it that should've been fixed regarding the mixing and the very obvious overdubs. I obviously give it a 4 out of 5 stars because the sets were great and the bands played well but the sound was tough to sit through.",1289088000,2,1219,4.495495495495495
4235883,2,B003ZVL0V4,"I recently saw this on display at J & R Music World in NYC and thought about buying it but then i remembered
Metallica's crappy performance and decided against it. Considering they make up 2 of the five hours of the release i'd just rather remember Slayer , Anthrax, and Megadeth's
killer performances during the live telecast.
One of the other reviewers mentioned Dave from Megadeth having his voice overdubbed for this release. Terrible and cheap.
Metallica was terrible because they sped up their songs (even the slow ones) and have lost their heaviness. Maybe they felt they had to try and catch up tempo-wise with the ret of the bill. Wrong move.
Lars' drumming tempo was off too at times.
You cant speed up the chorus of a song like 'Harvester of Sorrow' and make it sound good. My thought was - what's the rush? They could have played stuff at the regular tempo
with some gusto and really had a killer performance. Oh well.
I left the theater after seeing this and wondered how the other bands felt about them. Probably not that impressed.",1289001600,6,1046,4.629032258064516
4235884,4,B003ZVL0V4,"The Anthrax and Slayer performances are the best because it's not re-recorded, you can hear mistakes with is ""real"" and cool.  Megadeth was tough to watch because of the over dubbed vocals and I hated the boring Metallica performance.",1288915200,5,234,5.0
4235885,1,B003ZVL0V4,"Dave Chitstain's lame overdubbed vocals RUIN Megadeth's performance.  I guess his unbelievable unfounded ego and completely insecure personality wouldn't let the purchasers of this concert actually hear his LIVE performance.

Dave's vocals have been re-recorded in the studio.  And, badly.  As in ""SUCK"" badly.

His live vocals from the event weren't any worse.  Why re-do them?  Sure, he can barely sing live nowadays...but he re-records them in the studio, and they STILL sound completely without aggression, emotion, power, or competence.  Why not just leave them as they were?

For those who don't have the mental capacity or perceptual ability to tell that these vocals have been re-recorded, all one needs to do is watch Dave's mouth and listen.  But, for those who are STILL lacking in intelligence and competence to let their brains believe what they are seeing/hearing (probably due to fanboi-dom) then take a listen at the ""a country that's divided surely will not stand"" portion of ""Holy Wars.""  Compare the numerous YouTube recordings taken LIVE (""live"" as in meaning ACTUALLY LIVE and not ""Britney Spears lipsync live"" that's more of Dave's integrity level) on the date of the actual event with the recording on these dvds.  The vocals are totally different.  Listen to the following recording of the actual event on the day it occurred:

[...]

Notice how Dave has no vibrato on his voice when he says ""surely"" around the 2:01 mark.  Then, watch the dvd.  Suddenly, on the dvd, his vocal inflection is completely different throughout the song and he has wide early Geddy Lee type vibrato when he says ""surely.""  This is but merely one clear example  The vocals have all been re-recorded.  Lame.  Lame with a capital FU.

Next time, Dave...when you try to rip off fans with re-recorded studio altered performances by selling them as ""LIVE"" try to remember to not release a re-recorded version of an event that was seen actually LIVE as it happened by MILLIONS of people who will INSTANTLY be able to tell that you have re-recorded your performance due to the fact that you are insecure in your performance, insecure in your abilities, and flat-out incompetent and unable to perform your own songs competently live.

4235887,5,B003ZVL0V4,"Wow! I couldn't believe what I saw this on the big screen. Finally the Big Four permormed together on the same stage. Incredible to see, incredible to believe. Metallica and former guitarrist Dave Mustaine getting closer again after more of 25 years of disputes was something that rock history will remember forever. All the performances were great! That night was history, and having it on Blu-ray is like a dream come true!

4235888,5,B003ZVL0V4,"I saw this on the big screen like many others and my only real complaint was missing a good thirty minutes of Metallica's set when they had technical issues. I know part of this is all about nostalgia, but that's okay...I still loved it. Anthrax is one of the most underrated bands around, I still love Metallica (minus a few albums I could easily forget) and both Slayer and Megadeth have some killer songs. Mustaine can still shred like a madman and I love it.

Was it their best performances? Maybe not, but to see all of these bands on one stage is a life long dream...I just hope a next round in the States is forthcoming.",1287446400,4,627,4.358974358974359

4235933,5,B003ZVL0V4,"I'm not sure what is up w/ all of the Dave Mustaine hate on this... he sounds great to me and I've been a fan since ""Killing is my business..."" I've seen them live at the Hartford Agora (later the Hartford Ballroom in West Hartford, Ct.) a month or so after ""Peace Sells"" was released.... Flotsam and Jetsam opened actually and that's back when Jason Newsted (later of Metallica) was still their bassist. I remember car moshing to Megadeth's ""Liar"" as myself, the driver (Gabe), and another nut job metal-head (like myself) Bill T. all ended up in the back seat at the same time as the car was going 50mph down rt 34 in Derby, Ct...no driver.... how we didn't die is a miracle in and of itself lol. I'm 43 now and I mention all of that because if I know ANYTHING I know Dave's voice as I heard it likely more than I did my own mothers... and it sounds just as strong today as it did back then. In fact.... Megadeth imo has a better show than Metallica as Dave sticks to playing songs and singing songs as it was recorded on the albums... unlike Hetfield who must've forgotten how it was sung and played on the album. I say that because even as far back as the ""And Justice for all"" tour he started singing songs differently than recorded. Now don't misunderstand me. I love Metallica (up until the Black album) but live James sucks ...he always has a tendency to never stfu as he loves the sound of his own voice talking and/or voicing SOMETHING when only the instruments should be playing... (likely why they never play Orion 100% from beginning to end live lol) and I've seen them in person live half a dozen times thru the years, dozens on VHS tape (bootlegs), later on DVDs, and dozens of bootleg cassettes back in the day (for those my age they know the sound quality sucked on them but for us back then it was still awesome to have a bootleg lol). With that said if you've liked Metallica live in the past then you'll like this also.
 As far as Anthrax... they rock as always. Joey B. still has the enthusiasm of a kid still and it is obvious he loves playing live. Scott didn't really seem to get into it until the last two songs imo but his playing and back-up vocals were strong as ever and the rest of the band were awesome 100%.
  Slayer imo should have been the headliner as they have so many great songs that only 1/10th of them were able to be played in this and not all of the ones that I would have chosen... irregardless any Slayer is great Slayer. True ...Tom can no longer hit the high notes that he once did when he was 25 yrs. old (likely why we didn't hear ""Black Magic Night"" ...but then again outside of the beginning scream on ""Angel of Death"" they phased that high note stuff out before ""Reign in Blood"" album anyway. I personally love Dave Lombardo as he is Slayers heartbeat and to see K. King w/ a shaved head still gets me laughing as I remember him w/ long hair still lol.. but badass he will always be irregardless.
 Sound quality on this to me is great. Now I don't have a great system but I have my 70"" Aquos + hooked up to my Sony Receiver and two huge box speakers that have great bass and high notes enough to make my three dogs leave to go to quieter areas of the house (speakers like everyone had back in the 70s-80's). I know that isn't todays preference and is likely outdated but that's the speakers this music was originally played on and it still sounds best to hear it thru imo.
 The blu-ray clarity is awesome... not much else to say about that. There is no quick and constant flashing from one camera to another to the point that someone who gets seizures would need to worry lol. They change constant but not annoyingly so.
 The crowd made me laugh. First I noticed that those 21 and over had a yellow wrist band... and that was most of the crowd.. I then noticed that at least half of the crowd is 40+ yrs. old. To realize that we're all a bunch of old farts now made me laugh and think that our kids are so lucky to have metalheads as parents and not like our parents were who hated metal and constantly told us to ""turn it down"" and thought that Elvis was the ""King"". Now I have respect for Elvis and the beginnings of rock but our kids (or anyone under 40 yrs old) simply has no idea how it was to be raised by that generation and how anal they were and how metal was truly underground! Even back in the 80s 99% of people young hated metal also. So many today claim to have been into it then but most of them are liars. The truth is we were as underground as it got. It was a tight nit group. Kind of how bikers used to be before every Tom. Dick and Harry bought a Harley once they got their mid-life crisis ($20 grand and 20 thousands miles does NOT make you a biker!).. but thats another topic I won't get into lol
 If you are a metalhead young or old then don't hesitate to buy this blu-ray unless you're one of those extremely anal types of people who always wants to find a fault. If that is you then just go buy the CD and leave it at that.
  Overall its well worth the twenty bucks or so that it cost and I know I'll be watching it numerous times again. A classic for sure.",1423353600,,5132,4.186234817813765

4235950,5,B003ZVL0V4,"While I'm a big fan of metal music in general not just thrash, I have to admit thrash has always been my fav genre. To have 4 biggest thrash band at one stage for the first time in almost 3 decades is simply amazing.

Anthrax in my opinion was the best of the lot, at least for this particular show. Best sound production, best all around performance. The band look energetic. However, Anthrax was the only band here that didn't have guts to play some of their newer tunes. ""Only"" was from their 1992 album and their setlist didn't go beyond that.

Megadeth delivers instrumental wise, especially Chris Broderick who's ridiculously good guitarist  however Dave vocal was quite terrible, it's partially overdubbed I believe because some parts sounded different from the live streaming version.  Setlist was great, 12 songs from 7 different albums and ""Wake up dead"" and ""Headcrusher"" sounds wicked being played back to back. The best thing from Megadeth is the fact that David Ellefson has returned earlier that year after 8 year absent from the band!

I  like Slayer and still listen to their albums regularly but I never really like their live sound, everything sounds muddy and I really think they need to hire a better sound engineer or buy a better equipment... then again, they probably prefer to sound like this for the rest of their life.  Slayer show seems to be more powerfull in small indoor concert than big festival because in huge crowd like this one, it just weird to see 90% of the crowd just standing still with only 1-2 small circle pits while the band was blasting powerfull songs like War ensemble and Angel of death.

Metallica performance was good in general but they've put out way too many live albums since 2008. The death magnetic tour has been dragging on and on for eternity.... Live in Mexico (2 different shows), Quebec magnetic, Live in France, Through the never OST , seriously, their performance on this DVD sounds identical to any of those releases! Nothing new here.  Good thing there's ""Am I evil"" jam which certainly the highlight of this DVD.",1410825600,,2079,4.752777777777778

4235957,4,B003ZVL0V4,"The quality of this set is not the greatest. Don't expect a picture perfect clear production. Also the sound quality hurts especially with Slayer.

The sets in my opinion:

Anthrax - simply fun to watch, nothing to complain about here.
Metallica - A little boring since we've heard all these songs so much and James' howling/happy singing is annoying.
Slayer - The sound is not so good and it kind of ruins the experience. They do play Chemical Warfare which is one of my favorite Slayer songs.
Megadeth - Sounds pretty good but boring.

Anthrax is the best set and then it's a tie between Metallica and Slayer. Megadeth was pretty good but I'm kind of burnt out on them.

You do get some swag in the set, photo's and some picks. Its a nice set but I was expecting better shot quality and sound. Oh well, it's still great and a must have for fans of classic thrash metal.",1399939200,,871,4.425

Whatever they did to Megadeth's video and audio synch was messed up so bad, that I just could not stand to watch my own FAVORITE band of the Big 4.  Deadly serious.

I read that overdubs happened... well, no kidding.  Was it because of the bad weather throughout their set?  Quite possibly... but still.  The producers didn't seem to try too hard at synching the video against the audio.  I might be wrong, but when you cannot stand to watch your own favorite band's video... well, there are serious problems. What a kick butt set it must have been, though I loved the soundtrack for the set they used to overdub you all.  You got short changed regardless.

Anthrax, my second favorite band in the Big 4, kicked butt... I didn't seem to notice any issues with their performance on the DVD other than it was TOO STINKING SHORT.  It must suck to open for 3 other bands.  Guys, you did totally AWESOME.

I got fed up before I could watch Slayer... and scanned ahead to watch the single Big 4 all on stage song.  Oh by the way, no Video or Audio issues during Metallica's set up to that point I noticed (my once upon a time favorite metal band).

Dave Mustaine and Megadeth deserved better... the only reason I bought the darn DVD, and someone messed it up for me.  Tragically, I kinda expected it.  James and Lars... you guys should be embarrassed for treating the other 3 bands that way.

It gets 2 stars because I got to watch my 4 favorite metal bands live... thats it.  If I want genuine performances and fun, I'll just buy their own BAND SPECIFIC live releases from different tours.

They are intense and, when at their best, are simply THE BEST, imo.  They are very good here.

Starting with Anthrax on through Metallica the concert itself lived up to the hype. Excellent show overall and well worth owning. I will review each bands performance beginning with Anthrax.

Anthrax:
Short set filled mostly with their big 80's and early 90's hits. Joey Belladonna does a good job with vocals and the band sounds tight. They do a very cool tribute to Ronnie James Dio, who died shortly before the show. The band does not show as much energy as in days long past but still provided a great opening to the event. They left me wanting more.

Megadeth:
These guys have been putting on a guitar clinic forever and this show is no exception. If you haven't seen Megadeth live before there are no theatrics, just the guys blowing you away with their musicianship and guitar badassery. It is pouring rain through a good part of the set but they just keep going. Another short set but they cant all headline, now can they? They represented their whole catalog farily well with ""Hook in Mouth"" a pleasant surprise. Weird ""Holy Wars"" reprise at the end, though.

Slayer:
The show I most looked forward to but the biggest letdown. Tom Araya skipped words and missed lines due to walking away from the mic or just not singing some of the words. He is post surgery here and can no longer head bang. The band looked tired and seemed to mail this one in. Good overall set list with a few off the new album and some old faves. There are better Slayer shows out there, a disappointment to me anyway. I loved the Hanneman/Heiniken guitar!

Metallica:
Metallica are clearly the biggest act here and the crowd shows it. The energy level in the venue goes up quite a bit and the sun is down, making for a better visual. Metallica works a crowd better than anyone. They are clearly at the top of the heap. They have a good setlist with a nice mix of new and old. They brought back the big pyro thing blowing up the stage on ""one"" which was very cool. It may not have been their finest hour (Lars) but they closed the show as only Metallica know how, by bringing everyone out to play ""Am I Evil"" Seeing Kirk play a Les Paul was also a bonus for me as it is my instrument of choice.

4235978,5,B003ZVL0V4,"Great Concert from Sofia, Bulgaria.

Not bad for modern-day Metallica (they've really fallen off since James quit drinking, smoking, cursing and acting a fool). I hate saying that because the man put his life back on track, but it seems to be at the expense of the band. They headline the show and, following Megadeth, had no choice but to rock out or else risk being upstaged by Mustaine.

Slayer was incredible. You don't see much of them on Blu-Ray and you'll wonder why when you see them in Sofia.

Megadeth was clean and clear as usual. Good to see Dave Mustaine on the same stage as the mighty Met. Kinda keeps the Met from slacking as Dave is truly talented and will guarantee a great performance every time he takes the stage. When Dave quit crying about getting his drunken, drugged out ass kicked out of Metallica and started focusing on being good, Megadeth became a great live band... A band that demands the headliner step up his/her game.

The show opens with Anthrax and while my skateboarding days were over long ago, Anthrax was over before that! All I can say positive about them is, it's good to see they're still alive I guess.

Unless editing dictated it, it would seem Metallica played a full set, while the other three were abbreviated somewhat. All four sound good in this and the video is good too (it's Blu-Ray, it'd better look good). It's a two disc set, with the first three on one disc and Metallica's set is all alone on the second disc.

All in all, a definite great addition to the library.",1357084800,,1523,4.52

I never got into them for some reason. But guess what? When I watched the DVD's (in chronological order), I was totally blown away by Megadeth and Mustaine in particular. Totally blown. I became an instant fan after this.

My quick review?

Anthrax: Solid show but nothing spectacular.

Megadeth: Reviewed above.

Slayer: Something was amiss here. The crowd seemed to have been sapped by Megadeth's performance. Or maybe it's because Araya can't head bang anymore due to his neck surgery. But still a solid show.

Metallica: Cheesy. Corny. I can't explain it. When I watch the DVD from Seattle (And Justice For All from Binge & Purge), I see two different bands. What gives with Lars' toy drum kit? It's Charlie Watts! Hammett impressed me big time. His playing has improved so much in the last decade or so. I miss Newsted, too. James? His voice is shot. He can't sing the old tunes the way they were sang years ago. But they put on a very good show. They just aren't the same band I once knew.

Overall, a very well put together set. I bought the deluxe edition with the CD's included back when it came out. Then, after getting a Blu Ray player and an HDTV, I sprung for the Blu Ray version of this.

4235987,5,B003ZVL0V4,"IMHO, Metallica only has two things over Megadeth....Hetfield's amazing and instantly recognizable voice, and the fact that Metallica has always been more of a ""band"" than Megadeth.  James, Lars & Kirk have managed to stay together all these years while Dave has had a large number of partners in that same time frame.  Not that each lineup hasn't been great, cuz it has, but Metallica just projects a more cohesive identity as a band.  That said, Megadeth is much more interesting in the guitar department with always having two really good players, while Metallica relies pretty much totally on Hammett.  And then of course there's the key element in every band, the writing.  Metallica's writing is very, very good, but Mustaine's writing is just...better!  More creative, more diverse, even more emotional.  I mention all of this cuz it was impossible not to compare these two giants of this genre while watching this DVD set.  I like Anthrax well enough, but they're just not in the same league.  Joey Belladonna seemed to struggle a bit here and there.  And Slayer.....well, what can you say about Slayer.  I will give them props for still being the the top dog of the thrash idiom after two decades (the only band of the four that you could really still call thrash), but Mustaine  was quoted some years ago as saying ""boycott noise metal"", and I think that pretty much says it all for me.  Dave Lomabardo was very interesting to watch though.  Almost seems like he's too good to be in Slayer.

Mustaine was in really great voice for this show, and Chris Broderick was the hottest soloist of all four bands to my ears.  Metallica's set was very good, but it was still Megadeth for me.  Great stuff....buy it!",1329264000,,1715,4.739864864864865
4235988,5,B003ZVL0V4,"I own this DVD. Some people write reviews for things they have never owned or used; I am not one of them!

The quality is bright and clear; it was filmed mostly during the day. No corny video effects. The camera was steady unlike many other videos I have seen.

There are good shots of the fretboard, so if you are a musician it is nice; good shots of the drums as well. The sound quality is good.

Anthrax: was ok. They break right in the middle of Indians to play Heaven and Hell. I liked Heaven and Hell, it sound good, but putting it in the middle of Indians was blasphemy; right when the song is to go into the heavy mosh riff they throw this really slow piece in and it does not even sound like it fits. I wish they had just done Heaven and Hell separately because it is a great piece. Joey did the song and Dio justice. What about Gung Ho from spreading the disease or Stand or Fall? I would have liked to see A.D.I. on here, Finale, Now it's Dark, In My World, Belly of the Beast, I could go on and on about the song selection, needless to say I did not think these were the best choices. The lead guitar playing is very good, but I did not think the sound quality was very good for his instrument.  If you are and old school fan check out their new CD ""Worship Music"" it rocks.

Megadeth: Sounded better than Metallica, if you are a Megadeth fan that is. Holy Wars sounded great! Wake up dead sounded far better than the album; great fretboard shots of Dave's lead guitar work! I would have liked to see 1320 played; there should have been more songs off of Endagame other than Head Crusher. Hook in mouth is, lyrically, my favorite Megadeth song, and I was glad to see it on this DVD; I was able to learn how to play the lead guitar parts for this song just by watching this video!

Slayer: Slayer always sounds good live; they have a simple distortion system that does not involve too much tweaking. I would have liked to see Snuff on this DVD, but still there were plenty of newer songs by Slayer unlike the other bands on this DVD. Jihad was outstanding live, it sounded way better than the album original. Tom yelled out the ending instead of that prerecorded vocal sound that was really dull on the original album (great touch) it is very dramatic. Disciple is way better than the original album; the part where the music cuts out to the bass in the album sounds very weak, but in the live show Jeff does heavy rhythm guitar and it sounds Hella better than the original. You can see the intro to Chemical Warfare drummed out and Jihad has good drum shots also. King plays the lead as originally record for song: Seasons in the Abyss, but Jeff plays something completely different than the original lead so that was fun to see.

Metallica: I've seen this band live too many times. This DVD was better than any of the live shows I have been to (with the obvious exception of the atmosphere you don't get at home!). That Was Just Your Life was cool with the guitar duet of Kirk and James. Blackened had only half the guitar solo not the faster part of the solo, bummer. One is an old worn out song, but the fireworks were cool, it would have been more fun to be there; I still liked the way they did it. I've been to concerts where I think they were too drunk to play their songs all the way through. They would do the first half of Sanitarium and then drift off to another song. In this video, however, they played almost all the songs (except for part of the solo missing in Blackened) all the way through.
Bonus features: There is a lot of bonus footage that is cool showing the musicians are down to earth real people. Some DVD's like to do corny stuff for the bonus footage in an attempt at childish humor, like pretend interview questions meant for a laugh.  This DVD has real footage of what happens behind the scenes.
This DVD is the best I have seen for this specific group of bands. My only complaint is that I have seen other songs for the Big Four Sonisphere on YouTube and the music station Palladia (disposable heroes to name one) and there are other songs that have been recorded in high quality during this tour that were not put on this DVD. I hope they are planning to release another DVD of the songs that were left out, but somehow I doubt this will happen.",1324339200,,4289,4.266912669126691

4235995,5,B003ZVL0V4,"I first experienced Anthrax live back in the 80's, in a small venue near Norfolk Virginia.  This band still has what they had then and their performance is absolutely awesome.  Anthrax is probably the most raw thrash band on the DVD.

Friends of mine introduced me to Megadeth just after the release of Peace Sells, and I was an instant fan.  When Megadeth takes the stage the crowd in Sophia gets right in to the music and the energy is fantastic.  I was not disappointed with the performance, I would have chosen some different songs though from some of the newer releases.

The third and final band on the first DVD is Slayer.  I have been a Slayer fan since the first time I heard Seasons In The Abyss.  When Slayer comes on they take what you thought was the limit to a new level of an abso-f**kin-lutely incredible ass-whoopin' heavy onslaught.  I have watched the Slayer performance over more than any other.  The vocals, drums, everything is more than I ever expected, and I think my neighbors are gonna be fans soon if I keep playing it as loud as I do.

I took a break before putting in the second DVD which is all Metallica.  I first experienced Metallica when Master of Puppets was released, I played that tape until it wore out and then I bought another one.  Metallica has a good performance, and they difinately show that they are the headline band for a reason.  The performance is very entertaining and has great energy.  My favorite is when they play ""One"", if you haven't seen this song live its a good reason to buy this DVD.  I have seen Metallica live and in my opinion this performance was better than when they had the Black album tour.

Metallica and Megadeth presents the best performances to me. The set list is excellent in both cases and the songs are played with full force, but i expected a really HD image and sound quality for a blu ray edition.

4235999,4,B003ZVL0V4,"The Pros:

-Chris Broderick

-Awesome testament to thrash metal

-Nearly all original members together again

-Chris Broderick

The Cons:

-These are all American bands, god forbid they would ever play a monumental, career spanning, historical moment in their own country.

-The notion of a ""big four"" is pathetic, and is treated like a franchise these days.

-Metallica gets their own disc? That's a horrific bias. Their logo even takes up most of the case, which is just sad.

-After seeing Chris Broderick, everything else just seems like child's play.

-Slayer is child's play these days anyway.

-Mr. Hetfield's melodic singing DOES NOT fit Metallica's music.

The mix is good however I felt that Metallica's mix could have been a bit better. Or may be its just their sound. This is DVD you will want to keep in your collection.

I'm extremely glad it happened before any of these bands decided they were done, because having them all on one stage at one event makes this even more special.  I'm not for sappy feelings, but being there (and watching it) are quite the experiences.

I've seen recent concerts of Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer, but not Anthrax.  I can't believe Joey Belladonna has the charisma and energy that he has for 50.  It's mind blowing.  I'd say Anthrax and Megadeth tie for the best performances so far (I haven't even made it to disc 2 so I can't comment on Metallica).

Blu-ray quality is great, sound is absolutely fantastic.  Video is right on point.  At some points I really do feel like I'm standing in the crowd.

4236012,5,B003ZVL0V4,"I definitely had no chance of being in Europe this past summer for the Big 4 tour, and none of my local movie theaters carried the live feed from the Sofia concert featured on these DVD's.  When I first heard about this tour earlier this year, I could hardly believe it would happen, and even though I did peek at some of the performances online, I knew the DVD's would come along eventually so I've been waiting for the chance to experience a full show for myself. I'm happy to report that my enthusiasm for this gathering was never in vain, and that the performances, the crowd, and the atmosphere of the entire event gave me chills. The bands are in top form, the crowd is insane to say the least, and there is a magical air to this shameless celebration of the past. Yes, some new material is present, but the crowd and the bands are noticeably more energized on the 80's and early 90's material, when the Big 4 were still the Big 4. And not to belabor the point, but the crowd is so loud and into the music, singing along, chanting, clapping, roaring, it would be hard not to share their enjoyment. All of these musicians have been around for decades, so I have to admit that I had my doubts about whether they could pull off something that would recapture the old times, but I for one am satisfied with what I hear and see on this DVD. Here are what I see as a few highlights of the individual bands.

Anthrax--They get the crowd pumped from the start with an adrenaline-fueled Caught In A Mosh, and it never lets up. I have to say that even though Anthrax has been through some silliness over who's singing for them, it's great to see Joey running around the stage and belting out the old favorites like it's 1988. His voice sounds great to me, and his stage antics haven't changed a bit. The give-and-take between the band and crowd is probably the strongest of any of the bands, as Anthrax are true crowd-pleasers. The set list is all old material, unless you count Only as new. It's the only John Bush song, anyway. Individually, Be All, End All and Indians/Heaven and Hell are stand-out performances. Anthrax left thrash behind for awhile, but it looks like they've returned full force if this show is any indication of their future.

Megadeth--They play more of their post-Rust In Peace catalogue than fans of their early thrash albums will care for, but the crowd seems to enjoy every moment. I would've loved to see them play something from Killing Is My Business, like the title track, or Rattlehead, or Mechanix. But, Mustaine is probably the most talented musician of the night; his fingers look like a piano player's as they race up and down the fretboard. He doesn't have much to say to the crowd during the set, but not even some torrential downpours can stop them from going crazy throughout every song; on a couple of songs, they actually chant louder than the band is playing. They especially seem to love the Rust In Peace and Peace Sells songs, which are my favorites, too, along with In My Darkest Hour and Hook In Mouth. Headcrusher from the new album gets a great reaction, as well.

Slayer--I've seen more live Slayer than any of the Big 4, from the multiple concerts I've been to, to their live albums and DVD's. So other than the World Painted Blood songs and Jihad, I've seen these songs live many times. Slayer is still Slayer, as they've always been, and everyone knows they've changed the least out of these bands over the years. One thing I like a lot is that the songs World Painted Blood and Beauty Through Order are much more potent live than on the CD, and sound more like they fit in with older songs. I also like hearing Dave Lombardo playing drums on Disciple, which somehow makes it sound more like an older Slayer song. Tom, just like Joey and Scott from Anthrax and Dave Mustaine, seems at times in awe of the crowd, which is thunderous during Raining Blood. An amazing visual comes from this set, as the weather clears after the Megadeth set, and during Chemical Warfare, you get an amazing shot from behind Jeff Hanneman of the crowd, the horizon, and the sky. I won't try to describe what it looks like, but it's breathtaking.

Metallica--Just like with Slayer, I've seen tons of live Metallica stuff over the years, and you get what you'd expect from a Metallica show as far as the staples are concerned. Musically, they sound as good as they ever have, and vocally, James still hasn't had that gruff, sometimes vicious tone to his voice since And Justice For All. He sounds fine in this concert, but I don't always like hearing songs like Harvester of Sorrow done with clean vocals. Besides that, I thought the inclusion of songs like Harvester, Blackened, and Hit the Lights offered an older flavor to the show with songs I haven't seen performed a hundred times. Also to that end is the fact that no songs from Load or St. Anger made the cut, which I don't think you'll hear many metal fans complaining about. The crowd response to show opener Creeping Death is one of those awesome, spine-tingling moments that sets the tone for the incredible energy the audience maintains for the rest of Metallica's set. For two hours, nobody from the back to the front of the massive crowd stands still for a second, and not a single person fails to contribute to the wall of backing noise behind each song.

After highlights that include the aforementioned songs, an incredible pyro show introducing One, and the heavier, thrashier edge the Death Magnetic songs have live, the night concludes with possibly the greatest encore in metal history, when Metallica returns to the stage a few minutes after Enter Sandman. As any metal fan knows and has already watched online, all four bands join forces onstage and jam to Am I Evil, something that should be seen and savored by anyone who has ever listened to heavy metal music. The sight of Dave Mustaine playing alongside Metallica again is something I thought I'd never see, but it happened, and it was awesome. After the historic jam, Metallica finishes the show with supercharged renditions of Hit the Lights and Seek and Destroy, wrapping up a legendary event in vintage fashion. Like I said, this show is a celebration of metal music, the past, and the fans, and I'm glad I finally got to see it.

These DVD's capture a very special event, and I think anyone who likes these bands would enjoy them tremendously.  I've shown clips to a few people who don't even  like metal, and they had to admit the atmosphere is electric.  The connection between the bands and the huge crowd is a spectacle to behold.  If you were ever into these bands, this is a show you should see.",1299974400,3,6663,4.562709030100335

4236014,4,B003ZVL0V4,"If you want to induct someone into the world of thrash metal, you can't do much better than showing them this Blu-Ray disc. While it's true that the bands all show their age a bit, there are enough highlights here to recommend a purchase. The video is a bit soft, but acceptable. Sound quality is great. As for the performances:

Anthrax puts on a good show and vocalist Joey Belladonna acquits himself well, still managing to bust out a couple of air raid screams. Since it's Joey singing, the set is naturally heavy on the group's early albums. But a real surprise is when they play ""Only"" from their Sound of White Noise album; I was under the impression that Joey wouldn't sing any stuff from the John Bush era, but here it is. Plus there's a nice homage to the recently departed Ronnie James Dio when they suddenly break into Sabbath's ""Heaven and Hell"" in the middle of ""Indians.""

Megadeth's set is tight, focusing on older tunes. I suspect that other comments here about vocal overdubs are correct; there are times when Dave Mustaine's mouth barely moves and yet his vocals are loud and clear. But musically, they're the highlight of the show. After watching the band shuffle through several guitarists after Marty Friedman left, Chris Broderick is a godsend - technically proficient but clearly having fun on stage, a great counterpoint to Mustaine's typically gloomy stage presence. And estranged bassist Dave Ellefson's back! Honestly, the band line-up in this concert is the best since the Friedman/Menza era and I hope it sticks together for a long time.

Slayer's set is... serviceable. Time hasn't been kind to them, and neither have all the twinkies and big macs they've clearly consumed. Tom Araya doesn't even try to hit the scream that opens ""Angel of Death"" - for that matter, he doesn't bother with half the vocals on several songs - and Kerry King looks winded after two songs. Thankfully, drummer Dave Lombardi hasn't lost a beat and he skillfully saves the set from being forgettable.

Finally, there's Metallica, and their set is a mixed bag. Thankfully, they ignore most of the Load/ReLoad/St. Anger era, playing lots of early tunes and a few from Death Magnetic. They sound great on the newer songs but honestly, they sound a bit tired and sloppy as they rush through some of the older stuff (with the notable exception of ""Blackened"", which they nail dead-on). It's still a decent set, but James Hetfield's increasing thin voice and recurring problems with the mics on Lars Ulrich's drum kit keep it from being a great one.

Overall, it's still a great concert for us older thrashers to reminisce to and introduce a new generation to the genre. No life 'til leather!",1299456000,19,2694,4.797413793103448

4236018,4,B003ZVL0V4,"I was very excited to receive this bluray of the Big Four..
I have put together a really nice Theater System that gets every drop of performance from the new uncompressed formats offered on Bluray.  These days my taste in music has shifted to the lighter side but I still occasionally like to Rock Out !!  having come up in the 70's and 80's.
I have always been a fan of
Metallica//Megadeth/Anthrax: and Slayer but I'm not has familiar with Slayer has the other 3.
Now to the review. First the Negative....
This Bluray would have been better off being the Big 3.  The performance by Metallica was very disapointing to say the least..first the sound was aweful... I'm not sure who did the sound or what happened in the mix but just Aweful !!  I know from being a musician that it can be difficult to perform or achieve great sound in an outdoor situation but please.. it sounded like the drums weren't even mic'ed.  And their performance gave me the impression that the band had about 6 months off before getting together for this show.  Loose Loose Loose &  did I say SLOPPY - I couldn't even get through the whole show..very Dissapointing !!!!

NOW THE POSITIVE !!
Megadeth's concert would be worth buying this bluray all in itself - Just an Incredible Incredible performance and the sound was magnificent.  This was as good as it gets and as i said before outdoor can be tough..it also rained fairly heavy at times during their show and even in those conditions with fear of electricution they still gave a steller performace.  In a scale from 1 to 10 ..I'd go have to go with the ""Spinal Tap"" 11.. Kudoos to a great Metal Band for not relying on past success and is obviously still doing the hard work and delivering one hell of a Kick Ass Show!!
I also enjoyed Anthrax's show .. It is obvioius that they didn't receive the same attention to detail in the production as Megadeth but the sound was  good and their performance was also very good...I still have not checked out the Slayer But as I said before the Megadeth portion of this Bluray is worth the price of admission.  I really wish I could have said the same of Metalica but I just can't...",1297209600,,2152,4.461734693877551
4236019,5,B003ZVL0V4,"If you purchase one concert DVD or Blu Ray this year, this is the one you need!

3 Bands steal this show Anthrax, Metallica and Megadeth.  If you are wondering why i am not including Slayer is because the fans did not seem to like them as well, and I was very disappointed that they did not take the stage with Metallica Anthrax and Megadeth to do the song Am I Evil?  James Hetfield states that he is bringing out all the bands but it was very clear to me that neither Tom Araya, nor Kerry King were on stage with the other bands.  To me this was just disrespectful, so I now have a new reason to dislike Slayer.

Okay on to the other 3 acts.  Anthrax performs with (original?  depends on how familiar you are with the band) lead singer -- Joey Belladonna.  Joey does a great job on all the classic Anthrax tracks except ""Only"".  To me that is why Anthrax was a better stage band with John Bush than Joey, but that is just an opinion.

Megadeth is next.  MINDBLOWING!!!!  I have always liked Megadeth, but thought Metallica was a slightly better band; however, after watching both acts, I am not sure who is really better.  Both Metallica and Megadeth took to the stage like they owned it.  The Bulgaria crowd was even into both bands heavily.  I do not think I have ever seen a better performance from Megadeth (and I have seen them a lot.)  Plus as an added bonus Unlike Metallica, even the songs I like least by Megadeth sounded great live.  If not for the antics of Metallica on stage Megadeth would have been the best band of the concert.  To top it all off Megadeth did this during a storm.

Slayer I only watched a few minutes of, then placed in the Metallica disc, so I will not rate their performance.  If you are a fan of Slayer I am sure you will like them, But the only song I have ever liked by them is ""War Ensemble""

Metallica is better (in some ways) than they have been in years (because of Bass Player Robert Trujillo), but there is one problem.  Being a former Drummer, I could tell Lars was not playing the same Drum kit he had for years.  There was certain tones (for lack of a better word) that felt like they were missing or altered.  Again that is just one person's perspective.  One other thing that I did not care for were the songs ""Nothing Else Matters"" and ""Cyanide"" (again that is just a personal preference).  I would have preferred to see Lars with a Larger drum kit and performing the song ""and Justice For All"" in place of the two I disliked.

Overall a great concert!  Buy it on DVD or Blu Ray because they are only scheduled (so far) to play one date in the USA.",1297123200,2,2599,4.248979591836735

Take a look at the bonus material at the end of disc 2...it's pretty obvious the 4 bands don't click very well together and most likely got together for this tour just for the money. 3 out of 4 Slayer members didn't even come out for the jam with Metallica. But then again, how may guitarists and bassists do you need to do a song as simple as Am I Evil?",1296604800,,502,4.03

4236024,5,B003ZVL0V4,"When I bought the DVD, I had very low expectations for it.  I've seen each of these bands live (except for Anthrax) already and a lot of reviewers on here were biased against Megadeth, so I wasn't expecting much.

Anthrax's set was amazing.  Very easily could've stolen the show.  Then again, it's hard to say who did because it was great seeing these four bands on the same stage.  After their set, Megadeth played.  I said people were being biased because I thought Megadeth had some of the better performances from the entire concert.  Whether you're a fan of his or not, you gotta hand it to Dave Mustaine for being able to shred while doing so much touring.

Then, we move on to Slayer's set.  Y'know, it's really funny that people wrote such mean things about Megadeth being on this set because I thought out of all the bands, Slayer's set was the most disappointing.  Sounded very mudded out, and Tom Araya just didn't seem to have it in him that night.  I understand he had recently underwent back surgery, so that's probably why.  I'm not saying they entirely sucked, they had a few songs that were very powerful to see them perform.  However, I expected better.

Then of course, the almighty Metallica.  Their set was so long, it coulda very well been a separate DVD release.  Instead, they got their own disc on this set and quite honestly, their performance is enhanced thanks to that.  The video doesn't seem as compressed, and the audio sounds very tight.  Therefore, every bit of their performance was caught and every strum of the guitar sounded as crisp as the last.

To me, the highlight of this concert was the performance of ""Am I Evil?"" at the end of Metallica's set.  No matter what paths all the bands went down or up, at the end of the day they're all fighting for the cause of metal!  I think that's what biased people do; they forget about the music in favor of egos.

All of these bands are amazing in their own right.  If you agree, then you owe it to yourself to own this.  If you don't agree, then buy ""Rust in Peace"" by Megadeth, ""South of Heaven"" by Slayer,  ""Among the Living"" by Anthrax, and ""Master of Puppets"" by Metallica and get yourselves acquainted with some REAL music!",1295568000,,2210,4.506297229219143

4236026,4,B003ZVL0V4,"Having grown up during these bands' heyday, it's nice to see all of them still going strong (some stronger than others).

Anthrax put on an energetic set which was varied as far as the set list goes, well mixed, and flawlessly executed from a musical standpoint. Megadeth's set was ok, but Mustane seems to have lost something as a frontman...the band is really tight, though. Slayer...what can you say? It's hard to replicate the sound & fury of their live shows, but this video did a pretty good job of it. Dave Lombardo is a maniac and the drums were nicely placed in the mix, the guitar players put on a clinic, and Tom's vocal's sounded pretty good (as usual you couldn't hear his bass). This performance makes it worth the price of the DVD alone. I have mixed feelings about the Metallica set. Kirk played brilliantly, as did Robert Trujillo. James' rhythm guitar reminded why he's one of the best, his vocals were pretty good, too, and he had a nice rapport with the crowd. But Lars...I have no idea what happened to him. I know he's going for a more simplified drum sound lately, but it just looked like pure laziness at times (he didn't even try for the double kick rolls in ""One"", for instance). If Metallica had Lombardo, or Anthrax's drummer onstage instead it would have been an awesome performance. Regardless, it was a good set, happily with mostly classic tunes. Overall, a good show and worth picking up the DVD.",1295136000,12,1429,4.603921568627451
4236027,4,B003ZVL0V4,"I read lots of mixed reviews on this DVD. Most seemed to slam Megadeth and praise Anthrax and Metallica so I wasn't sure what to expect but I figured considering the price of the DVD and 4 bands, there's gonna be somewhere I'll get my money's worth?

In some cases, negative reviews come from the fans themselves complaining about two songs they thought should have been played but didn't or a drum solo in the middle, a medley or whatever.

Well, we've watched this video 9 times and here's the verdict and out of all four bands, I favor no one band over another so this is completely un-biased.

Overall, this DVD won't disappoint. It's very entertaining. The lighting and camera work are first rate.

I'm going to assume each band was given the opportunity in the final mix of the music because every band sounds different.

Anthrax and Megadeth had the most balanced sound. Slayer was very thin and sounded awful and Lars wanted to make sure the world heard his awful (and off time) drumming loud and clear over the rest of the band in Metallica's set.

Vocals - I think all the singers struggled... I'd give the nod to Mustaine out of the 4 and I've never been a Mustaine fan.

Overall performance - Megadeth hand's down ACED it... Anthrax had a very tight set too. Metallica at times had difficulty keeping time and James struggled with the vocals. Slayer's performance itself was good but was overshadowed by poor sound and an aged singer.

James Hetfield made a good point towards the end of the video. He said, ""we've been around almost 30 years"" and he's right. These guys aren't 20 year old kids anymore and at some points it shows.

I'd suggest buying this video, I think there's something in it that could entertain everybody... Enjoy!",1294963200,7,1748,4.612903225806452
4236028,5,B003ZVL0V4,My boyfriend is in LOVE with Metallica and just got a new HD TV and bluray player. This was the perfect gift for him since he wanted to be at the concert. Now he feels like he is with this DVD!,1294963200,2,193,3.731707317073171
4236029,5,B003ZVL0V4,"I agree with most of the other reviews here.  Anthrax and Megadeth's setlists and performances were great.  Dave Mustaine's (Megadeth) vocals sounded really bad in the theaters but seem to sound better on the DVD.  Metallica was great too, but I'm a little tired hearing all of those same songs again, and Slayer was definitely the worst of the four.

The highlight was definitely seeing them all play Am I Evil on stage together, especially seeing Dave Mustaine up there with Metallica after all those years of bad blood between them.",1294617600,4,535,4.846153846153846
4236030,5,B003ZVL0V4,"What is sure to be a timeless classic to metal fans in no time is the Big four dvd of the first Thrash/Speed Metal bands I'm talking about Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer, and finally the one the only METALLICA!!! Ok where should i start first? I purchased this dvd for two reasons Metallica and Megadeth are two of my favorite metal bands ever! 2nd reason you are plain and simply no Metal fan if you don't buy this case and point. I love thrash metal I think personally it is the best style in Heavy Metal music and with this dvd you cant go wrong there. Lets break it down performance by performance here first up Anthrax played a great set they sounded good got the crowd going very early and i like how the played Heaven and Hell a personal tribute to the late great Ronnie James Dio that was awesome i enjoyed that. 2nd Megadeth you can say what you want to even with the rain falling during their set they still ripped it up!! I love the setlist the boys played Dave Mustaine just continues to blow me away with his guitar playing skills in my opionion they had the second best performance on here. Now Slayer well don't get me wrong I love Slayer but this performance was most likely the least best on this dvd. With that being said the guitars drowned out the vocals and bass like always. But the Raining Blood performance was killer tho!! Now Metallica what can i say the most sucessful Metal band of all time always bring their A game to live shows and with this one it does not dissapoint not as good as the Orgullo, Pasion, Y Gloria dvd but still def worth checking out if you are a die hard Metallica like me. I wonder why Metallica always choose to open every show with Creeping Death? Don't get me wrong its an awesome song but i wish they would mix their setlist up a little too simiar to the Orgullo, Pasion, Y Gloria three nights in Mexico dvd. I loved this performance i loved the songs and the stage effects like the pyro and fireworks especially during the song One. I think with all the constant touring James Hetfields voice is wearing out i noticed it a few times with this dvd i hope and pray to God thats not the case. Bottom line if you love Thrash Metal or any of these bands listed this is the dvd for you I also love how all four bands jammed the Diamond Head song Am I evil during the Metallica set that was awesome!! And i love how Dave Mustaine hangs out with Lars, James and Kirk Hammett (Beleive it or not) see Dave just goes to show even what happened in the past doesnt mean the boys in Metallica are not your friends anymore. Do yourself a favor pick up this dvd now you won't regret it!",1294531200,,2620,4.242
4236031,5,B003ZVL0V4,"Well having these 4 bands one one stage is automatically 5 stars even if they sucked so much i eat the dvd, but thats not the case, this is an AWSOME DVD! Anthrax stole this show, WOW! so much energy and i found so many great songs i didn't know they had! I like be all end all more than madhouse now! Megadeth, being my favorite out of the 4 and seeing them live TWICE this year, they had the least energy, before the show they said if it rained its gunna suck, and it did on the very first song that happens to be holy wars, their faces were straight, shawn drover as always with his slow unmatchable drumming compared to nick menza, dave mustains vocals are great, even better than the rude awakening dvd, maybe becuase he didn't alter them, dave ellefson had the most energy tho. Slayer well from now on i will say slayer sucks on stage until i hear black magic live, they seriously need to play that song,so yeah until they do they suck (but i really love them deep inside) dave lombardo tore it up i swear one day his legs are just going to fly onto the crowd with suck killer bass fills. Metallica.....well im impressed, they really drew the crowd in and had alot of energy, im glad they played creeping death, whom the bell tolls and hit the lights,but they seriously need to stop playing fade to black,one and enter sandman and bring out the old school thrash , although they are my least favorite of the big 4 in general they did better than slayer and megadeth,(it kinda hurts saying that) but its true. It natural for these bands to not be at 100% its not 1986 anymore and they are older and its as hard as they can go, just be glad this happened and you people stop being so greedy, like i said this ENTIRE EVENT is a 5star rating, now just the DVD im so glad this finally happened and if you want to witness this live, buy the dvd. BTW that was the lamest crowds ever! no moshpits at all! only a little bit of pushing during raining blood but thats it, thats probly why megadeth and slayer did have any anticipation drawn from the crowd, i mean mustaine even says to the crowd ""the big 4 are here, it may not mean alot to you but it does to me!""",1294358400,,2159,4.1923076923076925

It seems grainy much like a picture that was blown far beyond its native resolution.  I have never seen a blu ray quite this poor.  I would not recommend buying this on blu ray, save yourself a couple dollars and buy it on dvd or audio alone.  The audio quality on this disc however, is excellent.  I just wish the video could have been up to par.  As for the performances, they are all excellent.  I did notice that Dave Mustaine's vocals seem to be a little off and heard that he overdubbed them.

Some say the rain killed it but it actually made everything look beyond epic. Especially the girls getting wet in the crowd. :)It also has a behind the scene documentary of the concert and it was really cool, you really get to see what these guys are like behind the scenes. I highly recommend this bluray everything looks incredible and the performances were top noch.

4236035,3,B003ZVL0V4,"If you are a fan of the Big 4 then you should buy this DVD. All of the bands play their greatest hits in front of a huge audience. I doubt all of the bands will ever get together to play a show like this again so it's nice to see a moment in history.

Sound (5/10): I give the sound only 5 stars because usually on a DVD I expect to hear things much better than I would at a concert. Not with this DVD. The sound is pretty much the same as you would hear if you were at a concert. It sounds ""far away"" except for the kick drum.

Picture (6/10): The picture quality is good but the camera positions weren't the best (at some points the camera must have been attached to the stage because the whole video shakes with the kick drum). Many times you have a full camera view of the entire stage and it's just like you are standing in the crowd.

So overall I give the DVD a 6 out of 10. I guess maybe they had planned to make the DVD similar to standing in the crowd so that explains the sound and camera angles. If you are a fan of the bands like I am then you will buy the DVD either way.",1293494400,2,1085,3.8565022421524664

Anyway, I was more interested in watching Metallica play live, but they were the last ones to play. I really like Megadeath, anthrax and slayer...but I was so excited to see metallica.

The only disappointing thing in it is the Slayer song, ""Jihad"", which is my favorite of theirs... Araya was off-key throughout most of it, which was a let down, but the rest is great; I highly recommend it to metal-heads.",1293235200,,403,4.45945945945946
4236039,4,B003ZVL0V4,"Okay, I'm not the same metal-head I was 20 years ago, and when I heard about this I was kinda ho-hum about it.  Yeah, this is the show I would have given my first born (pharaoh) son to see back in the day, but in 2010, I'm just not that jazzed about it.

What an idiot I turned out to be!  I sat through every minute of this thing and kept thinking, ""this is incredible!""  All the acts were great, and to try and rank them best to worst is impossible.  They all do their own distinct brand of thrash, and they all do it better than ANYONE.

Some of my highlights:

I've never seen a full live Slayer concert in person or even on a recording.  I don't think I ever really thought about that until I saw this.  Their set was absolutely BRUTAL!  Tom Araya literally has metal IN HIS BODY!  What more can you say about that?

Metallica was solid as always, and you can tell those guys are really enjoying themselves up there.  I think this is the best Kirk's ever sounded, his performance was off the charts!

Megadeth has always been one of my favorites, and I always go to their shows.  I've also probably seen about every piece of video footage there is on them.  This was no less amazing, although I don't get why they play the ending to Holy Wars twice.  Why would you do that?  I dunno, a small point, it just seems a little lazy to me.  And no one's ever accused Dave of having a great singing voice, or a great live guitar sound.

And Anthrax with Joey Belladonna is the only way to go.  Some of those songs really took me back to some great memories.  I haven't heard ""I Am The Law"" in probably 20+ years.

Having made the several thousand mile journey from Sri Lanka it was everything and more I imagined. However as in any metal festival the proximity to stage and musicians left me wanting to experience this historic chapter [and year]up close and personal.
I was delighted when I realised that the Sofia, Bulgaria performance had been filmed in HD.
The BD gives a superb dimension to a set of scintillating performances. As many reviewers have already covered the bands and performances I will not go there. Needless to say the live performances with Metallica's epic 2 hour set and the musicians from the big 4 gigging all on stage together before the final 2 songs just made my hair stand on end.
The filming and editing was a beautifully crafted [except video gain noise on some camera angles].

4236048,5,B003ZVL0V4,"There is no question that this DVD absolutely kicks ass. All four bands sounded and looked great. These bands in their inception represented the underground movement of thrash metal in the 80's. They went  on to kick some serious ass and in fact, carry the genre today. This disc is a perfect testament to those days. Joey Belladonna sounded just as I remembered him in the 80's, and the rest were excellent as well. Dave and Megadeth are probably the most solid of the bunch. There is the least variability in their sound, very impressed. Slayer sounded a bit more tired than usual, but this was due to Tom Araya's neck surgery. All things considered, they kicked ass as well. Metallica as always is just simply flawless and raw. Kirk never messes up, and the others, while messing up from time to time, give a heartfelt performance. There is no bologna with these discs; just pure kick ass heavy metal old school style. All four bands on the stage at one time singing Am I Evil? Need I say more? Video and audio are fantastic. Well worth the purchase",1290902400,9,1052,4.5661375661375665

Slayer, wow!  Never really got into Slayer until now.  These guys are a presence on stage.  Half of the crowd really into them, the other half appear scared haha.

Metallica, lame.  James can no longer sing like he use to and for me, it ruins the classic songs.  I can handle his weak voice on Fuel but not Creeping Death.  Disappointing for sure.

The Documentery was pretty good as well and worth watching.

4236053,5,B003ZVL0V4,"This is a review for the blu-ray 2 disc set.  On the first disc you get Anthrax, followed by Megadeth and then Slayer's set.  On the second disc you get the Metallica set and the bonus features.  I will break down the setlists at the bottom of the review.

First the sound is amazing in my opinion, as is the picture.  I thought the overall mix on all four sets was really good.  I've read the one review about Mustaine's vocals, I didn't notice it, so can't really comment on whether it has or hasn't been remixed.  It wasn't a concern for me personally.
The bonus features include a behind the sccenes documentary which includes interviews and a peak at the Am I Evil? rehearsal backstage which is just good fun.  I like back stage stuff and interviews so I dig that extra feature.

So for the bulk features of this ""product""  I give it five stars, good picture, good sound, bonus features are nice added touch.  I couldn't really find a reason to deduct any stars based on the product.  The camera shots are typical concert fodder, close stage center, back stage left, over the crowd, close up floating over crowd and behind the band looks. I appreciate the traditional camera shots, I am not really a fan of the waving, roving camera techniques where you flashy, quick looks and can't follow anything.  I like to get long shots of the guitar when there are solos etc. So , I was happy with the way this was shot.

Now for my personal opinions.  I was very happy with the setlists for Megadeth and Metallica.  Megadeth didn't waste time chatting, they went from song to song and really delivered.  I've seen Megadeth live many times and they are always incredible, this is no exception, what really got me going for the Megadeth set was the guitar, those riffs are just so amazing, and Chris Broderick is an amazing addition to this lineup.  His live performances with Nevermore were astounding and when he joined Megadeth I wondered if it would be enough for a guitarist of his caliber.  Clearly it is, he is having a blast.

I was unhappy with Slayer's setlist.  I have seen Slayer live and they are really worth seeing.  Songs like World Painted Blood, Jihad, Hate Worldwide, Beauty Through Order would have been better replaced with Dead Skin Mask (I can't believe they didn't play this one), Expendable Youth, Die by the Sword.  Too bad, but again, this is just my preference.  I really recommend the double live CD Decade of Aggression.  It's an amazing set of songs.

Metallica setlist mirrors their previous blu-ray release.  I think it's a solid set of songs and they sounded very good, the mix is great.  This is when you see all the guys coming together and perform together and that is alot of fun.  I've seen Metallica live every tour since 1986 and I can say this past tour has had some great setlists.  I could have done without N.E.M., but hey the crowd loved it.  If you have any questions I'll try to answer them.

((***Side ponder***  I wondered who decided what order the bands should perform in?  I found it curious to have Megadeth perform before Slayer as they are more widely known.))

If you dig all four, or one or two of these bands, this is worth owning and was alot of fun to watch.

4236054,4,B003ZVL0V4,"First off let me qualify this review by observing that what you get out of this will entirely depend on your personality. If you've just discovered Dave Mustaine used to be in Metallica and tediously need to inform everyone on the internet you meet of this fact, well good for you. If you spend a medically unsafe amount of your time screaming the word `Slayer,' over and over again at support bands, in pubs or just generally in the street that's all well and good. (I may add that you are ruining it for the rest of us, moderate individuals who love Slayer but don't feel the need to be boorish and loud about it, but whatever, to each their own) Both of you types of people have already made your judgments before even watching.

For the rest of the people out their who will treat this Blu Ray like any other and not lavish unfair amounts of scrutiny or praise on it due to peculiar flaws in the Metal community that sometimes cause preposterous rifts between Metallica and Megadeth, or those who like Slayer and only Slayer and feel the need to validate themselves by diminishing everything in the material universe that is not Slayer then this review is for you.

You may be please to learn that this is not a simple cash in on the legacy of four of metals brightest stars, but a well made disc that would stand well without the nostalgia or cult status thrust upon it.
The picture is pretty good if a little too grainy on close inspection but with generally good camera and editing work supporting this and in terms of sound quality there isn't much to complain about; the drums are particularly clear and well mixed.
For the most part the crowd is pretty inaudible but that is fine as far as I am concerned, except when singers prompt the crowd to join in and it seems as if no one knows the words.
The picture is in 1080i in 16:9 widescreen and you get a choice between Uncompressed PCM Stereo or DTS Master 5.1 Surround.
There aren't an avalanche of extras but there is a fairly entertaining 45 minute documentary to nicely round out the package.

In terms of individual performances each band plays very well, with the exception of the vocalists who seem to struggle a little at times but ultimately come out looking good, there are few if any musical mistakes and all the crowd favourites like `Raining Blood,' `Caught In A Mosh,' `Peace Sells...' and `Master of Puppets,' get an airing so few people will find themselves disappointed. Anthrax seem at times like they haven't fully got the crowd won over but deliver a strong performance anyway and win them over by the end.
Megadeth play especially well but some people complain that it may be the case that Dave's vocals are overdubbed. (I have to say I didn't notice this myself, but its fair to warn you) and Metallica play very energetically if a little loose.
All in all there is more good than band in every single performance and nothing that should upset all but the most pedantic of viewers.

So, the product is good looking, good sounding, with energetic performances and pretty good value for money, this set certainly does have a lot of pros, the cons you'll be happy to learn are entirely conditional.
Before you buy , the main question you need to ask yourself is `Do I really want this product?' and that is something to genuinely consider, because if like me you are a huge fan of every band involved and own DVDs and Blu Rays from their own catalogues then you may very well find this release wholly unnecessary.
In terms of track listing, Metallica's very recent `Francais Pour Une Nuit,' release shares every track in common with the performance here with the exception only of `For Whom The Bell Tolls,' `Welcome Home (Sanitarium),' and a very short version of `Hit The Lights,'
Anthrax similarly play every track of their set on their `Alive 2,' DVD to a more appreciative audience, bar the surprise addition of the John Bush era song `Only,' and about a minute or so from Black Sabbath's song `Heaven and Hell.'
Megadeth's set in its entirety has been represented on numerous other DVDs with the sole exception of `Headcrusher.'
Only Slayer break the trend however by playing a full half of their set devoted to music this side of the millennium.

If you have never bought a DVD or Blu Ray from any of these bands then I recommend this wholeheartedly, you do get an hour from each band of classic high quality thrash metal in high definition for, all in one place for a good price.
If you haven't owned any DVDs by at least one of the bands then it is still something you should consider. Finally, if like me the big four are just genuinely four of your favourite bands then of course, you should buy this, just being aware that you aren't going to get much that you haven't seen before.

I don't care if your hardcore metllica/megadeth fan. I'm A METAL FAN ALL AROUND THE WORLD, If you didn't like this product,then you need to listen to country from now on. I see Lars,James,and Kirk hug Dave (if you know your Metal History). No more who's no. 1 or no. 2 or 4. ALL 4 are no. 1 in my book. HELL even on the charts since the release they said it's the first time they had 4 different bands at no. 1 BUT under 1 title. It can happen I guess. I'll enjoy this over and over and over again. I'll show all my friends,and people I go to conventions with....that's a TON of people. I love the special Edition,with all extras so I can see what it would be like if I was in a band and that big or helping a band that was that big.
SO HEADBANG and enjoy.",1289520000,,933,4.247191011235955
4236056,3,B003ZVL0V4,"I had high hopes for this release but it falls short of the spectacular event that was touted. I have some discs of other performances by these bands that I can say are truly better. The Megadeth performance: Raining on the crowd, crowd doesn't get into the show as much due to this which drains the energy of the show.  Slayer Performance: Halfway decent other than Tom Araya skipping lyrics and trying to get the crowd to sing along instead of him doing the singing - and also rain. Metallica performance: Lars misses beats and sometimes can barely keep up with the songs. Things just don't gel as much with the Metallica show as much as the ""Francais Pour Une Nuit"" blu ray (get this one if you want to see a good show).  The camera work was pretty amateurish at times. The kept using the camera with water droplets on it during the Megadeth show which got on my nerves - just use it once or twice - then they should have stopped. I would rate these discs a C+ at best.",1289520000,10,972,4.306010928961749

4236058,5,B003ZVL0V4,"What needs to be realized here is that these guys are not young studs anymore. They have been rockin since the early 1980's. Other bands and other types of music have come and gone over the years but these guys soldiered on and stayed true to their roots. Dio and others are gone now, they won't be around forever.. we should celebrate these true pioneers of metal..they are the last of a dying breed of pure talent and innovation..and of course the show rocked!!",1289347200,4,463,4.523809523809524

Until that day comes everyone needs to grab any video material from this group including this dvd. audio was a little muddy on Slayers set but it sounded live and in your face. Anthrax really showed everyone they still have it. It would be nice to see these guys release something new. Metallica is just ""boardallica"" in my opinion this band just needs to go away. Megadeth liked the set but what was with Daves voice? Buy it for Slayer and Anthrax pass it if you want to see raw live performances from Metallica and Megadeth.",1289260800,9,619,4.486725663716814
4236060,5,B003ZVL0V4,"I was never a big fan of Anthrax, mostly because I never really listened to them back then but this performance has made me want to go back and take a better listen.

Anthrax:

In my opinion, Anthrax steals the show that night from watching this DVD. It's supposed to be a celebration of ""The Big Four"" but it left me wanting to watch more Anthrax. Mainly because they sound incredible and you know for a fact your getting the live feed without any trickery. Everything sounded like you were sitting right in front as it should. All the guys are having a blast and are on top of their game. What a shame they didn't get more time and at night but this is good enough because they schooled everyone else. Every song sounded great and it was a good even surprising mix of what I apparently never heard with the exception of I am the Law, Indians etc.. It was a good sounded diverse set with a hint of Punk from the bass player and a nice thoughtful and brilliantly played Heaven An Hell. I've watched their performance 4 times now and still love it.

Megadeth:

My favorite band out of the four put on a brilliantly played musical set. You can instantly tell from the Anthrax performance and sound quality that Megadeth had a totally different sound going on. More ""tinny"" Musically and sonically it sounded GREAT but Dave Mustains vocals RUINED the performance. I have seen a lot of Megadeth performances and he usually can pull it off.. sometimes he sounds great, sometimes not but this performance was AWFUL. He usually overdubs the official releases but apparently he didn't have much control over this one. I've read others who say the overdubs suck but unfortunate this is an overdub issue.. This is a vocal issue with Dave.

He needs to seek medical attention or do different songs because this falsetto he's doing sounds silly and embarrassing to sit here and watch it. He seems to really struggle with the higher register.. almost as if he's lost the back of his vocal chords.. I think the rain during their set was a message to the band to get Dave some help or hang it up. Watch it once and it's so embarrassing to see much less hear you will shrink back into your couch. the boys in the back must have been like wtf???

Slayer:

Couldn't hear them.. too damn muddy and the guitars are WAY in the back of the mix.. maybe these guys should get some better gear so we can really hear them? but they looked cool...

Metallica:

Same ole... What are you going to say? It sounded good but I heard Lars screw up a couple times but no biggie..It was Metallica and it's the same songs we've heard over and over..

So in the end I have to say it's worth it from a historical perspective and the added bonus of Anthrax schooling all the pro's that night.. well done",1289088000,25,2764,4.423228346456693

Performance was great in pouring rain.  Slayer was good but wanted a better setlist more from early albums.  Metallica was good and setlist was very expansive.  Enjoyed jam in am i evil but too short.  Should have played 3 to 4 songs together.
