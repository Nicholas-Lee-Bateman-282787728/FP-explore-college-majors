7813439,4,6301571851,"Raquel Welch plays a mother who has a teenage daughter in high school. In her history class her daughter is being taught that the World War II 'haulocaust' never happened. Furthermore the Jews made up the whole story for sympathy and to somehow make money.
Raquel finds out about this and confronts the princapal. He asks if she is Jewish or has any Jewish affiliates (she is not and does not). The principal basically tells her to mind her own business and let the school worry about her daughter's education and subject matter.
Raquel doesn't like this answer so she goes to the town hall to fight for 'what is right'. In one climatic scene she is defending her home with a shotgun from rednecks and neo-Nazis.
Raquel looks good in this movie as she always does. This is one of her few movies that prove that she can act and is more than a prop for men who admire her ......assets. Definately not 1,000,000 Years BC and definately not 'Juggs'. For the true Raquel fan, this is a jewel.",1010966400,7,987,4.488888888888889
7813440,1,6301571851,"This TVM directed by Anthony Page is like an episode of the Twilight Zone, so surreal is the environment. Perhaps it's in the casting of Raquel Welch as a mother of a teenage daughter and a cocktail waitress who works in her ""underwear"" who sues the school board for allowing their history teacher to use anti-semitic inflammatory revisionist tract. Given that the locale is a `redneck"" town, can anyone believe that the Jews were responsible for both the starting of the Vietnam war and the reason the Americans lost it, and that America was drawn into WW2 to protect Jewish bankers?! What presumably gives the teacher town support or at least indifference is layoffs at the local mill, also blamed on the international Jewish conspiracy, though tellingly there are no Jews in this town. Welch's rationale for pursuing the case is that she knows what it is to be the victim of innuendo, and perhaps with a better treatment than the one supplied by Robert Avrech, we might not consider the backlash argument of her dressing like a bimbo tramp. Page embarasses Welch by giving her thinking shots, but at least she is convincing in the deflection of jealous women and unwanted men's attention, and she scores one laugh line with ""What is this? True confessions?"" when asked by her counsel about her reputation. Given all this, the court case is unintentionally hilarious with a montage of disapproving looks at Welch, noisy hubbub of the crowd, and Welch's exasperated reactions.",1004140800,,1477,4.912
