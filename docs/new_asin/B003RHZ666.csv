Audie Murphy moves are hard to find, they are not all our on DVD yet.  There are a lot I would like to buy but can't.  Hopefully they will be produced soon.  I haven't been disappointed with any movie that I have gotten through Amazon.com.  I will keep buying.",1286409600,2,349,4.088235294117647
4185386,4,B003RHZ666,"I'm a fan of the old fashioned Western movies of the 1950's- 1970's era and Apache Rifles is no exception. Audie Murphy stars as a Calvary Captain sent out to deal with a Apache Indian rebellion. The transfer is pretty good considering a 1964 movie but there are a few spots in the movie where the transfer suffers, but only briefly. If you're a fan of old fashioned Calvary versus Indians movie's like I am then you should add this one to your collection. Movie studios should release more of these old movies as there are plenty that haven't been released to DVD yet.",1283731200,28,569,4.480769230769231

You every wonder why John Wayne never had him in any film. Too, much ego on Wayne's part. Burt Lancaster stared with him in the Unforgiven and Audie did a great job. Audie made 39 movies over his career and I have watched all but 2. I liked both Drums Across the River and Apache Rifles.

4185521,4,B003RHZ666,"Audie Murphy. World War II.s most decorated soldier (see to hell & back). To me growing up was movies on saturday with a western starring Audie Murphy. No he wasn't John Wayne. And some may say he only made B-westerns. Do not be misled. This guy was good. Real good. His remake of the James Stewart classic, Destry, was gutsy. But murphy pulled it off. Take a good look at just one Audie Murphy movie and suddenly you're hooked. And he pioneered the good bad guy. With his boyish looks it is difficult visionlizing Murphy as a cold blooded western killer until you remember this guy probably single handedly killed more men in WWII than any other man. His real life was tragic probably reflecting his mental scars from the war. But on the screen in a western or even in Red Badge of Courage his performances are compelling. Apache Rifles is not his best western. But it is well worth viewing.",1353715200,4,892,4.512345679012346

4185523,4,B003RHZ666,"The above line is actually uttered by James Coburn in Sam Peckinpah's PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID, however it seems more than appropriate in describing this Audie Murphy oater. Made at the same time as Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, APACHE RIFLES is definately a throwback to 1950's American Westerns, not that that's a bad thing, it's just that times have definately changed, perhaps not for the overall good, but changed they did. And this ""old"" style of Hollywood Western is about to morph into something far more cynical, with less emphasis on moral values and entering houses justified. The anti-hero has just been given birth and the true ""hero"" as savior has just been shattered. THE EXORCIST is only a few years away.

Had APACHE RIFLES been made in the 1950's it would have been given a decent budget and high profile director, and most likely would have been an important entry into the genre. This is by no means a criticism toward director William Whitney, who in my opinion was one of the best directors of the 1930's-40's. It's just that he's associated with low budget serial fare even though he could direct circles around the high profilers.

The plot is pretty straight-forward. The Apache have left the reservation because greedy miners led by L.Q. Jones (in one of his great as always roles) have encroached upon their given lands, killing Indians to line their pockets with gold. Nothing new here, but with a bigger budget it could have been. Audie, however, is spot-on as Jeff Preston, cavalry officer given command of the situation. He's hard as nails, a known Indian hater, yet he commands the respect of his troops. He sees the error of his ways and comes over to the Indian's point of view. It's a complex character that Audie handles skillfully. Unfortunately, Audie always seemed to get better, more assured of himself as an actor, honing in his acting skills to perfection as the budgets and market for his product lessened. Audie Murphy became a great actor when there was nothing left for him to act in. Very sad.

As for the dvd itself, my God, buy it.
Nice clear transfer. Another outstanding job from VCI. I could actually imagine myself in the the theater watching this.
YOU NEED THIS MOVIE if you are a serious fan of Western films. It's TRULY one of the last of it's kind, a dying breed. Times ARE changing and this type of Western film was soon to be no more. No more heroes, only cold blooded killers pretending to be heroes. This is one of the last true Westerns.",1337126400,9,2509,4.659142212189616
4185524,5,B003RHZ666,"It isn't one of Audie Murphy's greatest movies, but a good one & one where he shows his hatred for Native Americans, but he is won over! of course any movie with the 20th century's greatest real life hero is worth getting!",1334016000,,222,4.309523809523809

We are BIG Audie Murphy fans & our Grandchildren watch nothing but Audie when they come. Audie does a great job in this movie as usual & a little different to. Audie was born to play good westerns as he does in this movie & it will get played often in our house & if you watch it once you'll know why.....the movie industry didn't know what they had when they had Audie under contract or they'd of made many more good westerns with him.,1328918400,,602,4.145299145299146

4185527,4,B003RHZ666,"While not Audie's best Western (Try Six Black Horses, The Kid From Silver Creek, or No Name On The Bullet), this one is well worth watching.  It has a well written script with a different storyline (Audies is an Indian hating cavalry officer), and a thought provoking ending.
The action is well done, and as usual, Audie Murphy proves once again that he was a much better actor than he was ever given credit for...I would watch him read a telephone book.  Another thing about his films is that in real life, Audie could do just about everything he did in the movies...The man really earned that chest full of medals and the title of ""The Most Decorated Soldier of WWII""...A true Hero in every way!!!!",1313971200,,700,4.5476190476190474

Audie Murphy is a great actor and this is one of his better films. Michael Dante gives a very good performance. I met him at a convention once when he was signing autographs and he had nothing but praise to speak about Murphy.

This story truly depicts what happened over and over about the army's failure to keep promises made to Indian tribes who were moved to reservations.  The conditions on the majority of reservations were deplorable, and lead to sickness and death.  Audie Murphy does an outstanding job as the young officer, who tried to honor his promises.  He was also the most decorated soldier of World War II, and by all accounts was as honorable in his real life as he was in this movie.",1290384000,,733,5.7592592592592595
4185535,5,B003RHZ666,We in Australia are not short of Audie Murphy reissues there are many remastered westerns of Audies selling for as little as $5 Bounty Media has quite a number great picture quality great sound. Now to the movie again the boyish face of Audie pops up this time yet again as an officer in the Cavalry There is action a plenty in this oater with a cast of stalwart vets of the screen if you are a fan of Audie and you would not be reading this if you were not Hell what more can I say its a great movie and all the better for being remastered and as another reviewer states there are a stack more out there so stop the bootlegging and the constant winging and wineing grom film companies and put them out yourselves buy it.

4185537,5,B003RHZ666,"Within recent years the work of Randolph Scott has been substantially re-evaluated and is now highly treasured by film critics and film buffs, alike (especially with the release of the Budd Boetticher set). Now, it seems, is the time to take another look at the films starring Audie Murphy. Critics and the public esteem NO NAME ON THE BULLET, but his other Western films deserve serious consideration, also. Most of Murphy's Westerns were made with Universal, and they are uniformly good. Several titles are available overseas (in the PAL format), but unfortunately not yet available in the US (NTSC format); let's hope Universal will release them here as well.

Columbia Studios produced several Murphy vehicles towards the end of his career, and of these I think APACHE RIFLES may be one of the best of the lot. It features good acting by Murphy and a solid cast of familiar faces. The action sequences are well-conceived and expertly filmed. Production values are relatively high for such ""B"" type Westerns. VCI has found an excellent print.  So, in sum, this is a welcomed release in all respects. Highly recommended, and thanks VCI.",1288656000,10,1138,4.984210526315789
8403756,5,B003RHZ666,"I love Audie Murphy westerns! Too bad most of them are still unreleased on dvd, except for foreign PAL editions and non-studio versions made available from various sources, and in varying degrees of quality. Apache Rifles, released in 1964, is a good, somewhat altered remake of 1952's Indian Uprising starring George Montgomery. Again it's the Apache Indians vs. the invading gold miners, with the U. S. Cavalry caught in the middle. But this time it's Victorio instead of Geronimo. There's even a reference to the fact that Geronimo has already been shipped off to Florida. But to anyone who's seen both movies, the similarities between the two are obvious. It looks like they may have even used some of the same film footage. Still, both movies are well worth watching. I'm also a big George Montgomery fan. He also made a lot of good westerns, several of which are available on dvd. They're worth looking for!",1524441600,,913,4.858974358974359
