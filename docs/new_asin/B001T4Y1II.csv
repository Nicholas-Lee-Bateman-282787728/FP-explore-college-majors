The obvious love, confusion, dedication, fear and will to read/do/research so much that Eric and Jennie so candidly documented in this film had my eyes brimming multiple times.

Seeing the process they went through and hearing about choices and therapies opened my eyes to some ideas I have not yet explored and plan to.

Recognizing similar emotions, thoughts, etc. in Eric and Jennie to ones other parents and I have faced, as well as recognizing some similarities in Graham and my own child was cathartic for me.

The story, woven together from Eric's point of view, with Jennie's honest discussions and expert's contributions was so very real.

As a parent facing the SPD question, I so appreciate this film.  As an educator who looks back at students I have known that I could have helped ""if only"" I had known more about SPD at the time, I feel this film is very important to ""get out there"" to educators, therapists, doctors.

Thank you, Eric and Jennie, for sharing your story.  Please, others, use this film as a place to begin your own research, open discussions, spread awareness, love and understand children who hitherto may have been misunderstood or misdiagnosed.",1296777600,,1268,4.943396226415095

8340526,5,B001T4Y1II,"I have recommended this video to parents to illustrate the similarities between ASD and SPD. It also shows that parents have options - choices for service delivery (DIR/Floortime, Sonrise, ABA) as well as preschool placements.  A very powerful video!",1253491200,4,250,5.410256410256411

through is depicted with honest openness that will
help others who find themselves wondering what
to do.",1241740800,2,153,4.703703703703703
8340528,5,B001T4Y1II,"What a wonderful film!  Parents will no doubt relate to the struggles that Erik & Jennie Linthorst endure as they search for answers to help little Graham.

Doctors and teachers should watch this film to get a clear understanding of what Sensory Processing Disorder is.  It might help them realize that children who exhibit ""Autistic-Like"" behaviors don't necessarily have to be on the autism spectrum.

This film will be so helpful for anyone who works with children.  I will be raving about it to everyone I know!",1238284800,6,515,4.873563218390805
8340529,5,B001T4Y1II,"Raising a child with SPD can be a frustrating and overwhelming task for parents as they learn about the disorder and their child's triggers of sensory overload.

As an advocate for families, I immediately identified with the powerful message of early intervention and ""trusting your gut"" which came through loud and clear.

By opening up their lives (and some of the heartbreak only a parent who has been there can understand), Erik and Jennie Linthorst have generously given us all a remarkably poignant and educational resource.

Those who are beginning their journey can learn from them, and those who are a bit further down the road are now waiting with open arms for the Linthorst's to join them.  Proof of the powerful message of hope you can create in less than 60 minutes.  I for one am so proud to endorse this film throughout my network as a ""must-see"" film for SPD Awareness.

If you don't know about this film yet, it should be seen by every Pediatrician, Preschool and Elementary Teacher and Occupational Therapist in your circle.

Spread the word - Graham's Story is here!

8340530,5,B001T4Y1II,"I would highly recommend this DVD for parents who have been told that their child has a sensory processing disorder.  When we first heard the words SPD, we were so confused and scared and not sure what to do to help our son.  If we had seen this DVD at the same time we were originally told, it would have saved a lot of time, effort and sleepless nights knowing that there was a light at the end of the tunnel and that we weren't going through it alone.",1235347200,7,454,4.089887640449438
