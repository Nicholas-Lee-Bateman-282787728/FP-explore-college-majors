8058253,3,B00098FL9S,"Movie was very realistic but .... Cant find a amazon us dvd version for sale, maybe big casino money doesnt want this movie available to Joe Public.  Also no intro or dealings with Gamblers Anonomus which I wonder how effective can such a popular treatment program be with Casinos making big money.  It was scary how the husband was powerless to stop the wife from going to the legal big money bet pusher down the street.  Maybe if the husband wouldve called a bluff and told the wife he would turn her in for stealing money from work unless she does this or enters a program.  And the kids were trapped lacking necisities from her gambling.  A good kindle book on slot gambling for non gamblers is called Somebody Get Me A Hammer and another good kindle book on internet gambling is called A Mugs Game",1462838400,,802,4.465753424657534
