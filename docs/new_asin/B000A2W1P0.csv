If these manufacturers are going to release movies, they should let people know that they're gonna bleep, or edit, them.  I'm surprised the brief nudity at the beginning (which most get edited for) got by. It's not about seeing or hearing something, but how they treat the viewer.  If I wanted to see a ""censored"" version, I'd see it (if they'd show it) on broadcast tv. It's like with a cheapo version I had (which was a waste of money) of Terminal Island that bleeped and edited out material.  There should be two versions of dvds, one with edits and one without, that way people can choose.  I know the third movie Submarine Alert will be ok, because it was made so far back that there's nothing they can edit.  Enough said.",1271635200,,839,4.56
8073215,4,B000A2W1P0,"I liked all of the movies on here. Definetly worth $5. Now since amazon didn't give the ratings i will.

Submarine Alert-1943-(5.9/10)-Starring: Richard Arlen and Wendy Barrie.  An F.B.I agent infiltrates a gang of Axis Spies planning to attack West Coast shipping. <My Take>A good suspense movie...Worth watching

Escape From Sobibor-1987-(7.5/10)-Starring: Alan Arkin and Rutger Hauer. The true story of The Largest Prison  from a Death Camp in WW2. <My Take> Awesome it is a great movie and nearly comparable to ""THE GREAT ESCAPE""

Casablanca Express-1989-(3.9/10)-Starring: Glenn Ford and Donald Pleasence. Nazi Commandos hijack the train carrying Winston Churchill. <My Take> Despite its low 4 star rating it is actually a good movie and a pretty good action movie

Final Note: If you find it under $5 like i did...Buy It",1260835200,,826,5.267175572519084
