7863721,5,6304160372,"We have watched this wonderful video many times until it was worn out and wish it was on DVD.  It's in part a documentary of Israel and the historical places where Jesus walked, taught, lived and died, with music sung by the world renowned Mormon Tabernacle Choir as they tour the Holy Land.  I highly recommend it.",1331683200,,315,4.508771929824562
