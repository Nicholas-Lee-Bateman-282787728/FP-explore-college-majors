1003068,5,6305261636,"Mulan, Michelle Yeoh, and Cynthia Rothrock all walk in the shadow of Angela Mao. In ""Dance of Death"" Angela Mao (Mao Fu Ying) is surrounded by Hong Kong's top action talent, both on-screen and behind the  scenes, in this cinematic aphorism for all the best in kungfu movies. This  splendid martial arts film is a comedy first, but with sufficient dramatic  intrigue to pull you through to its rewarding concluding battle. It was  filmed at the height of her 10+ year history as an action star. The  choreography by Jackie Chan, credited as Chen Lung (""Dragon  Chen""), is a master work, providing a look at Chinese wushu (martial  art) culture that is irreverent yet affectionate. This movie also provides  lessons about the traditional tales of women as heroes in Chinese culture.  Please read on to learn more about how to watch and appreciate this film -  some guidance is useful.
Media notes: letterbox format. Cantonese with  English and Chinese sub-titles.
The premise: Angela plays a free-spirited  itinerant who comes upon two old men battling in an abandoned courtyard.  Neither seems to be able to get the advantage of the other. Eavesdropping,  she learns they have been meeting every 5 years to ""compare  skill"" and still they can't reach a conclusion. They are  ""playing"" their kungfu and attempting to trick each other, and  the harder they contrive, the sillier they get. As we'll soon learn, Angela  has need of the skill she sees they have: she's seen the cost of inferior  kungfu skills. She ingeniously contrives a novel way of having them settle  their argument. She'll learn both their martial arts skills, and try them  out herself to see whose is most effective. See the movie to see the trials  she puts her teachers through while sand-bagging them on whose kungfu is  best.
Guidepost #1: Only you and I know our heroine Fei-Fei (""Fly  Fly"") is a woman. She wears men's clothing, so no one in the film  catches on, ever. No woman in China could wander about freely as does the  itinerant Fei-Fei, hence the man's clothes. But we know, and that's all  there is. There is no ""gosh, there's a romantic woman underneath""  ploy as in Michelle Yeoh's spectacular ""Wing Chun"" (I'll soon  review this film as well). She makes her friends, endures tragedy, learns  her skills, and takes her revenge without yielding to any gender  stereotype.
Guidepost #2: The story is told using an opening sequence  where she spies on her prospective teachers and contrives to get them to  teach her kungfu, followed by a poorly integrated flashback to when she  rescues and befriends a proponent of ""5 Styles"" kungfu. She  inadvertently leads the minions of the evil Ma Fa-chun to her new friend  and his school, leading to the slaughter of all the 5 Styles  ""family"". The flashback then ends with her agreeing to undertake  the harsh training it takes to become  proficient in kungfu and take her  revenge on Ma Fa-chun and the 100 Birds school.
Guidepost #3: The martial  arts action in ""Dance of Death"" is filmed in long continuous  choreographed sequences where the players match moves as if in a chess  match. Lovers of dance will delight in the interplay of skill, played at a  speed we can visually comprehend. One could learn from this movie. If your  taste runs towards brutal beatings, maimings, and improbable strength or  technique, there is nothing here for you. The choppy editing used in  Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies as a substitute for martial arts play is  absent. This is art of kungfu on film, not the art of film  editing.
Guidepost #4: This is kungfu played for fun. The 5 Styles refers  to the basic animals Dragon, Tiger, Snake, Crane and Leopard. I have seen  authoritative counts of as many as 300 distinct Chinese martial arts  styles. 5 Animals Style is the one kungfu system from the real world used  in this movie. The rival systems, as best I can determine, are all from the  fertile imagination of Jackie Chan. Ma Fa-chun, our prime villain, is a  proponent of the improbable Up-turned Horse Boxing style. Jackie succeeds  in lampooning the 5 Animals style and the stodgy approach to teaching he  probably suffered through in Chinese opera school, while at the same time  conveying the essence of the oral and physical tradition that underpin it.  The martial and acrobatic skill shown here are very real, and very much an  art. No other culture in our world has developed the art of movement to  this level - they ""sing"" with their bodies. Fei-Fei, her  teachers, Ma Fa-chun, his son, and the hilarious character ""Bird  Egg"" all demonstrate physical fluidity that is rarely seen even today.  Also, don't miss the highly unusual technique demonstrated by Bird Egg in  his second battle with Fei-Fei. Very offensive.  The viewer should also  note the poetic names given the various techniques used by the martial  artists. Common to traditional Chinese martial arts teaching is the use of  poems to accompany a sequence of movements and aid in its memorization and  comprehension. Included in these poetic references is the movement  ""Mu-lan pulls the bow"", and a few others invoking the legendary  Fa Mu-lan.
""Dance of Death"" was filmed in 1980, and I was  fortunate to see it one of the three theaters in Boston's Chinatown that  offered kungfu movies at the time. Being congenitally Caucasian, me and my  kungfu buddies went into these theaters without much of a clue as to what  we'd see. Our guiding principle was ""if its not in the poster, it's  not in the movie"". In this case, we got everything in the poster and  more. We reaped one of our greatest rewards of our movie-viewing treks. I  was in the theater every day till its run ended. I made an ill-considered  vow then  that someday I'd have a copy of this movie: thank you Amazon.com  for making this come true.",918259200,5,5808,4.790697674418604
7886567,3,6305261636,"This flick was directed by Jackie Chan. ""Dance Of Death"" could have been a 4 star easily. I though this flick was just o.k,,,,I'm a big fan of the ""crazy horse kung fu"", which is very rare in kung fu movies. This movie highlighted that kung fu style very nicely I though,,,however, I felt it went over-board in the final fight scene, which resulted the fight became extremely boaring,,,I swear,,this went on for approximately 20 mins. That is why I ended up giving this film a 3 star. However, the choreography was nicely done.",1150934400,,527,4.617021276595745
7886568,5,6305261636,"Angela Mao Ying plays Fei Fei, an orphan girl disguised as a boy, who seeks revenge on the ruthless and wicked gang who killed her friends. (She's too cute to be a guy - anyone could pick that up). She enlisted the help of two neighborhood clowns and tricked them into teaching her their kung fu styles in order to settle an argument between them of which one was the best. Getting her rear end kicked a few times and escaping for her life, she was able to collect herself each time and make adjustments to her fighting style.  This flick is a delight.  In this one you will see one of the main characters from ""Ninja Checkmate.""  I won't say who, you'll have to get the DVD yourself!

Overall, this flick has a plot, sticks to it, and the fighting scenes are excellent. Angela Mao is a talented fighter and you will see her skill clearly in this one. She reminds me somewhat of Polly Shang Kuan.

I got this one remastered - full uncut version, but it's subtitled in English.  What a bomber! You have to constantly look at the bottom of the screen to know what's going on. If you understand Cantanese, don't sleep on this gem. Other than that, the movie's picture and sound quality are great.  No problems.  This flick is 26 years old.  If you have the chance of getting it, by all means add it to your collection.",1140825600,,1315,4.33469387755102
7886569,4,6305261636,"Very funny Angela Mao vehicle. She plays a character named Fei Fei who is seeking vengeance for the deaths of some friends she just met, as well as trying to help two older kung-fu masters decide who is the better fighter.  Much comedy is provided by these two men. One is a drunk with a prominent red nose and the other is smoking something that causes hilariously goofy music to play whenever he takes a hit off his pipe. Angela is very funny, mixing in a good deal of slapstick with straight fighting, in the various combat scenes. Also funny are nods to both Clint Eastwood's man with no name and Henry Mancini's Pink Panther theme. Recomended to those looking for a more light hearted martial arts flick.",1032998400,,709,4.5390625
7886570,3,6305261636,I've seen kung fu movies where The actors sort play or dance around but most of the time it leads to a more serious confrontations. In this movie it never did. This was more of a kung fu Ballet than a martial arts movie. I love Angela Mao Ying but boy this movie is not one of her best.,1005350400,,286,3.864406779661017
7886571,5,6305261636,"If you are a fan of Angela Mao Ying this is the DVD to get.  It features a number of innovative training and fighting scenes which lead up to a spectacular conclusion. We owe the films great action scenes to Angela's art of Kung Fu and also the great Martial Arts Director Jackie Chan.
This Kung Fu fable is a must see and certainly one you should add to your collection.  Enjoy.",994032000,,379,4.25

7886573,3,6305261636,"It had a very poor beginning. I'm into Martial Art movies -but only the serious ones. The type where there is serious anger being let out in  fighting. Well don't expect that from this movie. Expect a bit of dumb  jokes, dorky fighters, and a waste of time. However towards the end, when  the movie finally picks up. The choreagraphy is excellent and the fighting  is superb. Rent this movie first because its a tough decision.",948326400,,427,4.578947368421052
7886574,4,6305261636,"Congratulations! The producers of this DVD got somehow hold of the Chinese spoken original print of this movie which seems to be undamaged at all  after all those years! It's a surprise since other releases of Crash Cinema  like CRIPPLED AVENGERS or DUEL OF THE SHAOLIN FIST were rather poor on  DVD.Superb picture and clarity and the movie's original Chinese and English  subtitles on the print itself. Perfect for all the fans around! The movie  itself is a rather typical average Kung Fu comedy from the late seventies  with some often-seen-before gag clich&eacute;s. It stars Angela Mao Ying who does  her best to save the movie. By it is rather known that Jackie Chan served  as a director of the martial arts choreography since he is a friend of  director Chen Chi-Hua (not the director enlisted by amazon, sorry!) with  whom he worked at Lo Wei's Film Company in the seventies. And so his best  movie to date is in fact one of the movies he did with Jackie Chan, SNAKE  AND CRANE ARTS OF SHAOLIN.Greetings, Oliver Sodemann, Germany",948326400,,1038,4.737430167597766
7886575,4,6305261636,"This is one of her last efforts - and it might be her best.  As usual, she's cute as can be, as she delivers lethal leg kicks to the baddies.  Her efforts to enlist the aid of two old martial arts experts in her training  are hilarious.  In the final scene she dances her way to victory - one sexy  number. The only fault I can find is that when she dresses as a boy, she's  too pretty to be believable.",936144000,3,403,3.9135802469135803
7886576,5,6305261636,"I have long been a fan of Angela Mao, but her grace, artistry and skill in this film is breathtaking.  The film itself is a lighthearted delight.  A few of the subtitles were hard to read, and a dubbed version would have  been perferable so that your eyes would never have to leave the action.  This is still a wonderful film.",919728000,,326,4.295081967213115
