6248504,3,B00I3SW45K,"I love all of these old, campy biker flicks. The only issue with this release is the very poor quality of the transfer. The dialoge was barely intelligble in most parts.",1404691200,,169,4.483870967741935
6248505,5,B00I3SW45K,"My review pertains to one of the three films included in this set, namely THE YOUNG CYCLE GIRLS (1978), which was just about the last of the R-rated ""youth"" films from the seventies.  Although the full-frame print quality isn't great, this is the rare uncut version, with a fair amount of topless nudity.  Three female high school graduates decide to take a motorcycle trip to the west coast.  As they travel through several states, they encounter hassles at every turn.  I honestly believe that Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF (from GRINDHOUSE) owes a huge debt to this film.

In the US, this film was released on VHS in a heavily-censored TV print and given a phony title (CYCLE VIXENS).  This new DVD version is similar to an uncut Australian PAL tape from the 1980's.  Although I would have preferred a remastered , widescreen transfer of THE YOUNG CYCLE GIRLS, it's great to finally have it on a pressed DVD in the US.  You'll be humming the film's theme song ""Cruisin, Cruisin, Cruisin Down the Line"" for days afterward.

Despite the set's title ""Box of Bikers,"" all three films are contained on one disc.

Despite alternate titles, the other two films in this set are C.C. AND COMPANY (Joe Namath, Ann-Margret), and J.C. (about a Christ-like biker).  Print quality is variable.  J.C. looks to have been transferred from a VHS tape, as it reveals some damage consistent with VHS ""burn-through"" in one scene.",1398124800,35,1413,4.817427385892116
6248506,3,B00I3SW45K,"Pretty cheesy biker movies but great if you are into low budget, grainy, 70's ""biker"" movies with occasional flickers and tracking issues (think bad film reel and early VHS tape). Some unintended humor and a lot of bad acting may keep you entertained though. The surprise ending of Young Cycle Girls is definitely unexpected. There is however, a strong chance that you will get sick of the single song that repeats throughout the movie before you get there.",1481068800,,457,4.871794871794871
6248507,1,B00I3SW45K,These movies were BAD. CC Rider was mediocre at best and the other two were just awful.,1476662400,,87,4.176470588235294
