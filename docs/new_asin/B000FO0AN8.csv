8124906,5,B000FO0AN8,"Anna Moffo sings and looks great in this well deserved tribute. I am a Joan Sutherland fan but I also enjoy Anna, and if the truth is told, I enjoy Anna's Lucia a bit more. Joan has a stronger voice but Anna sings with more passion and intelligence. I would say their techniques are about equal except Anna tends to be less flashy. The quality of the clips varies but after all it is the music that you should be coming to this DVD for. The visuals are decent but not of a high quality coming mostly from TV captures. The audio is fine.",1345766400,4,536,4.163461538461538
8124907,5,B000FO0AN8,"Anna Moffo, either you absolutely love her or you're a Joan Sutherland fan.  If you're a JS fan then please move on.  For those who adore Anna Moffo, this is a MUST have.  As we all know, her voice is unexcelled, her beauty is unparalled and her acting above reproach.  Seeing as Ms. Moffo is no longer with us, this is a great collector's item.  Wonderful arias come to life with the sterling clear and always beautifully emoting instrument that is Ms. Moffo's voice.

The only draw back of this DVD is the fact that the majority of it is in black and white, hence the quality of video is not excellent.  And the photo on the cover is not seen in the DVD.  But, who cares, it's Anna Moffo!!!  What more could you want?",1170720000,12,719,4.266666666666667
8124908,1,B000FO0AN8,"This DVD was intended to be a ""tribute"", but I would have to say that after reviewing its results, I found that the actual motive for issuing this video may have to be called into question.  The video quality of the film was less than satisfactory, in particular the excerpt taken from Gounod's opera ""Romeo and Juliette"".  Other scenes from ""La Boheme"" and ""La Traviata"" were somewhat better, but not by very much.  Perhaps, the age of the original tapes contributed to the low quality, but if that were the case, a precautionary note should at least have been included on the cover of the DVD.  As an Anna Moffo fan, I was extremely disappointed.",1162166400,10,648,4.608695652173913
