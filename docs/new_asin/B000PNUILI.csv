8192836,5,B000PNUILI,"I'm a dedicated fan of ""Good Eats"" and Alton Brown. Even though I worked as a cook in high end kitchens for several years, I have learned more about food and food preparation from Alton than from any other source.

""All in a Day's Eatin'"" is a 3-DVD set that's one of the more disjointed concepts in a ""Good Eats"" multi-DVD set. Disc one, ""Morning Munchables"" features breakfast foods from the basic waffle to ""Crepe Quiche Lorraine"", and even the exotic-sounding (but delicious) ""Overnight Monkey Bread"". Disc two, ""Flat Out Tasty"" is meat-centric (""Beef Paillard"", ""Chicken Kiev"", ""Oil Poached Flounder"", etc.) It is great for demonstrating myriad methods of meat preparation on a single DVD. Disc three, ""Tasty Toppings"" is a catch-all DVD of sauces and toppings and logical uses for them: ""Strip Steak with Pepper Cream Sauce"", ""Raymond Beurre Blanc"", truly one of the most amusing puns Alton has ever foisted on his audience as a dish name, and ""Hollandaise"" just to name three of the recipes demonstrated.

This is another entertaining, educational, and practical DVD set from Alton Brown, and I highly recommend it.",1436659200,5,1122,5.026881720430108

8192838,5,B000PNUILI,"Alton Brown is a great teacher. My husband LOVES his show. Once my kids are old enough I am going to use his videos to teach them how to cook and approach kitchen gear. Very practical, entertaining (he's nerdy, sarcastic, yet super down-to-earth- but might be annoying to some people), and always very informative. If you're not sure if you'll like his videos, I think you can view some of his shows on Food Network or YouTube. I think he really appeals to those people who like to the why of cooking and the science behind why certain recipes work and why others do not. I love that he is resourceful and doesn' try to ""sell"" upscale kitchen gear to appear like a better chef. Wish he was a neighbor!",1267574400,8,701,4.4
8192839,3,B000PNUILI,"$100???  Are the DVDs made out of gold?  I saw other volumes on here going for $60 or more -- even that's ridiculous.

Good Eats is a great show -- the best on Food Network, in my opinion -- but what these sellers are asking you to pay is absolutely absurd and completely unjustifiable.",1217116800,19,286,4.2592592592592595
8192840,5,B000PNUILI,"For the moment I say buy from Target...price $16.99.

As for content, it is typical Alton Brown.  He is funny, informative, and not bad on the eyes - even if his fashion sense leaves something to be desired.  Oh and the recipes are great, too!

The 3 discs are Morning Munchables (great collection of breakfast goodies); Flat Out Tasty (Beef Paillard, Chicken Kiev, Turkey Piccata, 3 recipes for Flounder, Chicken Fried Steak, Country Style Steak, and Swiss Steak); and Tasty Toppings (2 Mayonnaise recipes, Strip Steak with Pepper Cream Sauce, Hollandaise, Beurre Blanc, Compound Butter, and Honey Butter).",1181606400,57,607,5.163265306122449
