8340877,3,B000WPE8SI,"I've been a car guy all my life and owned a lot of the muscle cars featured. But I still learned some things I didn't know before about some of the Muscle cars that prowled the streets in the 60's and 70's. There is a lot of repeat file footage that I could live without, when you see the shows strung together this way it's becomes very apparent. Even in the same episode, they repeat some clips two or more times, needed to fill the time slot I guess, but over all I enjoyed my trip down memory lane. There are lots of commercial breaks but none to watch so your back in the drives seat quickly. A couple of times they get the facts wrong, but for the most part it's quite accurate. All show the cars featured going down the drag strip and that is fun to see again, so many years after seeing it the first time and it was a common sight at drag strips across the country. What would have made it better was if they had early footage of some of these drag stip pairings. All things considered, it fun to share with your car buddies, but don't take everything said as gospel.",1220572800,4,1075,4.148325358851674
