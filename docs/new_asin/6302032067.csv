7819873,5,6302032067,"This was the very first time I saw ""A Christmas Carol"", either a live production or animated.. so naturally it will always stick with me as the true ""A Christmas Carol"".  I recorded the version off of pay-per-view several years ago, but the picture wasn't very good.  Then last year I found a copy of it at a Dollar General Store for $5.00.  I was sooooo excited.  I couldn't wait to get home and watch it.
While my views may sound (and be) commpletely biased based on sentimentality... I still believe this is the perfect version to capture childrens attention.  The dialogue is plain and simple.  The music is soothing and captivating to young ears.  And it ends on a very happy high note.
Indeed, my own daughter.. who is 4 1/2 as of this writing.. has almost worn out the video herself watching it over and over.  I've been looking for another copy to store away for her sister who is due in January.  I can only hope that it's re-release is not too far away.  For those of us who prefer nostalgia verses theatrical art.. this Scrooge is worth waiting for.",975283200,5,1060,4.44559585492228
