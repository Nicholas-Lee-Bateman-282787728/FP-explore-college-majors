140490,5,0792834917,"Peter Sellers was a comic genius, and nowhere is this more evident than in A Shot in the Dark, the first of the Pink Panther series to exclusively feature Sellers' Inspector Clouseau. It's one case where the sequel is  superior to the original! This film can only be described as gaspingly  funny. I've seen this move several dozen times, but it still makes me howl  with laughter every time I see it. It's amazing to think that Sellers also  made The Pink Panther, Dr. Stangelove, and The World of Henry Orient the  same year (all titles I would highly recommend as well). The fact that  ""Shot"" is now on DVD in widescreen makes it that much more  special. The supporting cast (Elke Sommer, Herbert Lom, George Sanders, and  Bert Kwouk, among others) is perfect and provides a perfect ensemble foil  to Sellers. The ""Camp Sunshine"" scene alone makes  ""Shot"" worth seeing. This film is so funny, I can recommend that  you purchase it without having seen it first -- it's that good!",944438400,84,981,4.645348837209302
140521,4,0792834917,"Doesn't seem quite as funny as it once did. Still, it's top Sellers. The crack international cast js a delight, led by a slyly droll George Sanders. The opening cartoon-style credits are cute but interminable, leavened only by that classic score",1515369600,,245,5.0

140524,3,0792834917,"You'd have to be desperate for entertainment to purchase this home-made DVD-r of the 1935 film of the same name.  An Amazon listing error may cause you to receive this title instead of the Peter Sellers classic so beware.  If this 1935 film is actually what you want, the audio is pretty bad but the video is okay.",1506038400,2,314,4.396551724137931

140526,1,0792834917,"First I should point out that this is a review of the 1935 movie called ""A Shot in the Dark,"" an incredibly low-budget piece of junk, and not the infinitely superior 1964 movie of the same name with Peter Sellers -- although, Amazon has placed this horrible 1935 version right on the very same page as the Peter Sellers movie, making it appear to the casual observer to be the same movie.  Unfortunately, I was a casual -- negligent -- observer, I thought I was getting the Sellers movie, and wound up with this abomination.  This movie (the 1935 film) is dreadful.  The DVD sound is so awful at first I thought it was another Alpha Video.  The movie runs only just over an hour, but nothing happens for a long time, and when anything does happen, the sound is so garbled and the acting so amateurish that you just don't care, you give up and toss the thing in the trash can where it belongs.  The moral of this story is this -- if you want to order a movie, check and double check and triple check to make sure you're ordering the right movie.  (Meanwhile, I will attempt to explain this situation to Amazon Customer Service and maybe they will move this awful 1935 trash off the page with the Peter Sellers movie.)  Bottom line -- this 1935 movie is worthless junk.",1503705600,2,1267,4.388888888888889

140551,4,0792834917,"As the picture shows, this is a bundling of eight previously released individual DVDs, not a true box set.  It appears these disks were for the Canadian market, as all text on the covers is in both English and French.  Some of the DVDs are SDH subtitled and some are not.  I bought the set mainly for THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER, and was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU with Alan Arkin in the title role.",1494374400,,435,4.345679012345679

140554,4,0792834917,"When this first came out in 1964, I laughed till my sides hurt.  It was Peter Sellers second film as Inspector Clouseau, the bumbling detective, but the first one to feature him throughout.  He was the inspiration for ""Get Smart"", Don Adams long running TV sitcom.  While it is somewhat dated today, it
still can make you laugh, and if you haven't seen it, it should really be hilarious.  As with all comedy, it becomes less funny with repeated viewing, as the element of surprise is gone.  Still, I wanted to add this to my DVD collection, as I think I laughed more on first viewing than any other film before or since.",1491523200,,620,4.451327433628318

The prize goes to Herbert LOM, and his zany descent into a delightful craziness. For anybody who loves the Pink Panther movies and Peter Sellers in particular this one is not to be missed. By the way, Elke Sommers is such a delight. There's no actress like her these days. Viva La 60s!",1481500800,,397,4.306666666666667

140608,5,0792834917,"This was another fantastic addition to the Pink Panther series. I laughed until my abs ached. It never ceases to amaze me that Kato always picked the worse times to practice ""assaulting"" Clouseau with their practice fighting. Elke Sommer looked absolutely stunning and the Chief Inspector Dreyfus character just continues to develop marvelously. The ankle biting scene at the end was hilarious. The nudist colony part was brilliantly shot and Inspector Clouseau can totally destroy words that will leave you shaking with laughter. I do recommend this movie if you want a great night in with some rib tickling humor.",1481328000,2,615,5.16

140914,5,0792834917,"Comedies I don't do that often. Peter Sellers, however, is one of my faves... He and George Carlin can make me smile and sometimes laugh. First watching this one will do both. Cute, funny and quaint. Peter Sellers was tip top in the role of the French detective Clouseau. His boss, Herbert Lom, is obviously made crazy by this quirky fellow who doesn't seem to be in the same dimension as the other police. He is captured by the lovely Elke Sommer who steals the show with her innocent sexiness. One can not help but be amused at how she finds it easy to know the ways of men and women. Her willingness to cooperate makes it appear obvious that she didn't do the murder that continues to be the subject of the movie. The people being killed right and left may or may not be connected. The viewer is encouraged to have fun, try to solve the mystery with Clouseau and enjoy this film that screams ""let's make popcorn!"" I love the flash to the past that the costumes and culture brings up to those who didn't live through the 60's. There are fewer of us all the time. For instance, Elke Sommer, in France is wearing a headscarf, very much like my grandmother did quite often to protect her hair from the wind. I like head scarfs for this reason. I bought one last year around Christmas as gifts and think they're lovely to match these scarfs with coats.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Floral-Paisley-Filligree-Elegant-Luxurious-100-Silk-Scarf-Off-White-Red-22-x-22-Inch/dp/B017YH5XK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Floral Paisley Filligree - Elegant Luxurious 100% Silk Scarf - Off-White & Red - 22 x 22 Inch</a>&nbsp;It's a sad thing to me that they have now become such a distraction to us that we don't remember our own past and lighten up  our opinions about others.

141099,1,0792834917,"Okay, so I wasn't a fan of the original Pink Panther.  What am I doing watching the first sequel?  I thought maybe I was missing something, so I'd give A Shot in the Dark, the only film in the series not to involve the Pink Panther diamond, a try.  Fortunately, I was able to see it on Turner Classic Movies.  Unfortunately, I still wasted my time on this unfunny dud.

One of the servants has been murdered at the home of Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders).  The finger of suspicion points clearly as Maria (Elke Sommer).  After all, this beautiful servant was found in a locked room with the body.  Any police officer would arrest her and move on to their next case.

Unfortunately, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) has caught this high profile case, and he doesn't believe Maria is guilty for one moment.  His reasoning?  She's hot!  His idea of solving the case involves releasing her from prison and then following her to see who tries to hurt her.  Unfortunately, every time she gets out of jail, a new murder takes place with her being the only logical suspect.  Is Clouseau correct or is he enabling a murderer?

This movie tries to blend mystery with comedy.  It fails on both levels.

Okay, so I was probably expecting too much of it on the mystery side of things.  After all, I do love the genre and have my expectations every time I sit down to enjoy one.  More than really being a mystery, this was a series of events that involved murder.  There are virtually no clues and no real attempt to figure things out based on them.  Even the ending is so abrupt and confusing, I had to watch it a couple times to truly figure out what was happening.

As a comedy, the best I can give this one is amusing.  Some of the pratfalls made me almost smile.  Most of them were so painfully obvious from the moment the scene started I wasn't laughing.  I do enjoy slapstick, but it has to take me by surprise to truly make me laugh.  Slapstick jokes that are set up too far in advance just don't work.  Furthermore, they weren't consistent enough to feel like a real part of the movie.  Instead, they felt like they were forced in to make this a comedy.

I will give the actors this, they truly do try.  The acting accomplishes what it needs to with the script it has.  I'm not saying any of the performances are brilliant, but they also never took me out of the film.  They are in keeping with the tone that the script was trying to convey.

Then there was the content.  I was actually shocked at what they got away with in this 1964 film.  One of the murders takes place at a nudist colony, and Clouseau is there searching for Maria before the body is found.  Yes, all the important parts are covered, and how Clouseau goes about it does provide one of the few amusing spots, but it wasn't funny enough to justify the scene.  It felt like they were trying for daring and clever, and it didn't really hit that.

Then there's the sex scene.  It's played for laughs as other things are going on around the couple.  Again, we don't see anything that would get it higher than a PG rating.  But the scene quickly turns uncomfortable and stupid because of what they try to do with it.  I certainly wouldn't want my kids watching either of these scenes.

A Shot in the Dark tries too hard to be funny and clever.  And whenever you've got someone saying, ""Look at how funny I am,"" they never are.  There's no reason to waste any time on this poor movie.",1432080000,,3444,4.3627760252365935

141144,5,0792834917,"This is the crme de la crme of all things Pink Panther and Clouseau, despite the fact that ""Panther"" appears nowhere in the title.  Such a splendid film: It's no wonder Peter Sellers veered from the character in, presumably, a bid to avoid typecasting.  Ironic that he stormed back into the role a decade afterwards.

I admire engineering, finely honed, and that's what you'll detect in this picture, especially the 2nd or 3rd time around.  This is exquisitely crafted comedy.  An example: Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers (again, presumably it was these two) sat down and plotted an absolute impossibility when Elke Somers visits Clouseau in his office at the police station.  Namely: How can we get Elke Somers into Clouseau's office when there is a single doorway in, Clouseau's desk faces the doorway, and Clouseau is sitting behind the desk?  It's not possible, and yet it is pulled off with precise choreography.  You'll see this all throughout A Shot In The Dark.  A marvel to watch.

I do a halfway decent Inspector Clouseau impression, and it is almost entirely from this film upon which I draw his pompous pronouncements.

Great comedy is timeless.  Few films enter that portal because at some point, the comedy comes off as dated.  Not here.  One of the secrets?  Physical comedy, coupled with an endurably funny Peter Sellers.  He seldom needs lines.  You'll roar at his overall demeanor.",1424304000,,1399,4.910256410256411

141211,4,0792834917,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...

A Shot In The Dark (1964) is a pretty funny movie in the Pink Panther series of movies.  This movie stars Peter Sellers, Elke Sommer, Herbert Lom, and George Sanders (Rebecca, Batman TV series).  This movie is definitely funnier than the first movie in the series, a movie where the humor fell flat a little bit.  The music by Henry Mancini is good and really adds to the movie in a positive way.  The screenplay is good and was written by Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty (The Exorcist).

If you want to see a good entry in the Pink Panther series, then see this movie.",1399766400,,682,4.451612903225806

141222,4,0792834917,"If you love the Peter Seller's in his Pink Panther guise, you will enjoy this film immensely.  It's unfortunate that the film hasn't been digitally re-mastered as the dull transfer detracts from the hilarious antics.",1397433600,,216,5.171428571428572
141223,4,0792834917,"A Shot in the Dark is a classic who-done-it set in a French manor house with a variety of servants and intrigues.  Sort of a film version of the board game Clue, a series of murders in the manor house keep Clouseau busy with his sometimes absurd analyses of who shot, strangled, or stabbed whom and for what reason.  What makes such morbidity funny is Sellers' (too convincing!) portrayal of Inspector Clouseau through his bumbling genius to the correct conclusion.  This movie has no redeeming social content but is a great example of what '60s audiences found to be hilarious.",1396828800,,578,4.76
141224,5,0792834917,"A Shot in the Dark (1964) was released just 6 months after the debut film, and this time the focus is on Inspector Clouseau, who clumsily tries to solve a murder case. This film doesn't mention the pink panther diamond at all. In some ways, this is good, because this series achieves its greatness through a variety of plots centered around Clouseau after the debut film. The music is of the forthcoming Inspector series of cartoons, instead of the pink panther theme. The level of humor in this film is just right, and not over-the-top, though very much slapstick. Interestingly, the film has some serious parts, with accompanying music to suit the scene; this is a nice added touch that doesn't spoil the continuity at all. Peter Sellers delivers a great performance as Clouseau, though I like him a tad better in Return of the Pink Panther. In fact, while I give this film the highest rating, I'm still not sure that it's the best in the series; I'm trying to decide between this film, the first film, or Return of the Pink Panther. Strangely, this film is a little more raw than the first film, and the sound isn't the greatest either. Overall, this is highly-recommended entertainment for those who enjoy a good comedy with good acting and music.",1393891200,,1251,4.6909090909090905

141226,5,0792834917,"This is by far the funniest of the Inspector Clouseau movies, with laughs from beginning to end without letting up.

The original movie ""The Pink Panther"" was originally intended to make David Niven and his character ""The Phantom"" as the hero, but Peter Sellers managed to steal the show from him, and somehow within a short time Blake Edwards came up with this one, this time with Clouseau as the actual star.  Herbert Lom is brought in, and also gives as fantastic performance as Commissioner Dreyfus.

The story starts with a murder of a servant in the household of the millionaire Ballon.  Maria Gambrelli, another servant, is implicated, but Clouseau arrives on the scene and falls instantly in love with Gambrelli-and is convinced she is not guilty, despite evidence to the contrary.  Soon another Ballon household member is killed, then another, all the clues implicating Gambrelli repeatedly...but Clouseau adamantly insists she is innocent.  But there are other things going on in the Ballon household to suggest that others besides Gambrelli were more likely to commit murder.  Could Clouseau be right after all?

There is slapstick, but also clever verbal humor...and the slapstick is minimized, unlike in the later movies where it is exaggerated.  The two most hilarious scenes are where Clouseau and Gambrelli try to escape the nudist colony and the argument among the Ballon household in the end.  Highly recommended.",1393718400,,1431,5.1558441558441555

Poor Herbert Lom.....I'd want to kill Sellers as well since he always is at the wrong end of all events.
George Sanders does a fine job as the rich mansion owner in which a mysterious murder has taken place.  Solving this murder is what the plot line is all about and how Clouseau bungles his way to the solution.",1389225600,,623,4.535714285714286

Herbert Lom, as Inspector Dreyfus, is equally strong as the harried chief who is breaking down in front of us.

Edwards' direction is stellar. There are scenes in this film that look like they have no place in a comedy (the montage of the gloved killer following the date.) Edwards pulls off the feat of melding a whodunit mystery with screwball comedy! Doesn't this sound like the two genres have no business playing together? You won't feel that way after you watch this film.

141295,5,0792834917,"Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards are at their Best in A SHOT IN THE DARK. The Pink Panther (Inspector Clouseau) films were so popular that once seen you will never forget them. Whether it was the animated image of the Pink Panther or images of Peter Sellers' bumbling yet likeable screen personification of Inspector Clouseau or Henry Mancini's unmistakable theme you never forget.

A SHOT IN THE DARK has somehow come up short with the younger fans for no good reason other than its title. It does not say ""Pink Panther"" yet once discovered A SHOT IN THE DARK is a true gem. A SHOT IN THE DARK is a great example of sophisticated slapstick (screenplay by Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty based on plays by Harry Kurnitz and Marcel Achard). A SHOT IN THE DARK has Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Kato, which THE PINK PANTHER did not. A SHOT IN THE DARK focuses on Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. It is really more character based and driven than THE PINK PANTHER. In many ways A SHOT IN THE DARK is much funnier. It really defines the character of Clouseau a good-natured inspector who just cannot see the forest for the trees. George Sanders is once again brilliant in another similar role, the type that he perfected throughout his career. This time he is the very sardonic yet stately Benjamin Ballon one of Clouseau's suspects. The cast also includes Elke Sommer (the most obvious suspect to the audience), Tracy Reed, Graham Stark and Martin Benson. The opening shot (shots in the dark) and the nudist colony scenes are great examples of Blake Edwards' direction at his best. Production designer Michael Stringer and cinematographer Christopher Challis visually replicate the idea of shots and murder taking place in the dark or at least in places where passions run uncontrollable.

A SHOT IN THE DARK has a much different look than the invigorating and opulent images found in THE PINK PANTHER. Henry Mancini once again delivers a very good score. A SHOT IN THE DARK's main title theme is very good but has been greatly overshadowed by THE PINK PANTHER theme. But can you blame it? A SHOT IN THE DARK is somehow in a league of its own yet it spawned all the great supporting characters found in the subsequent films which we all came to love and couldn't get enough of. A SHOT IN THE DARK was the foundation for what was to come and made the world of Inspector Clouseau so enduring and endearing yet there is something very different and special about this one film. It is somehow etched in a time that can never be replicated. To really enjoy it try to place yourself back in that time.",1337731200,,2637,4.632478632478633

Based on a play, Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty collaborated to produce a brilliant screenplay, which opens with a murder at luxurious country estate of Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders).  The maid, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), is found near the body of the chauffer with a smoking gun in her hand, and arrested.  The case appears to be open and shut, as the facts clearly point to the maid's guilt, however Inspector Clouseau searches for another answer.

The Inspector's reputation for being an incompetent fool, is the reason he remains on the case.  The residents and household staff at the Ballon household are involved in an interconnecting series of intrigues that soon lead to additional murders, where the unfortunate Ms. Gambrelli is again present.  Clouseau's investigations and repeated release of Maria from custody, soon frustrates his superior, Superintendent Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), driving him to the edge of madness.

Highlights include a night on the town where Clouseau and Gambrelli hit a number of restaurants and night clubs, where various unsuccessful attempts are made to kill the Inspector, leaving behind a series of unfortunate victims.  The wild night finishes with a surprise attack by Clouseau's valet Kato (Burt Kwok).  A hilarious segment at a nudist colony, features some create camera angles, as the Inspector conducts his investigation while wearing a guitar.  The movie's dramatic conclusion takes place at the Ballon residence, where those under suspicion gather to hear Clouseau announce the killer.

Henry Mancini contributes another topnotch score on a Blake Edwards film, including the rousing instrumental title track.

""This case is so full of cracks, one more wouldn't make any difference.""

This is what Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) says when he's talking about the murder case that Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) of the French Surete has been accidentally been assigned too.  (He also says the sentence that titles this review.)

This comedy film is the second installment in the Pink Panther series.  In fact, this film was released a few months after the first Clouseau film, ""The Pink Panther"" (1963).

This movie is an adaptation of a stage play that itself was adapted from the French play ""L'Idiote.""

It is in this film that Sellers gives Clouseau an exaggerated French accent that becomes a hallmark of the character.  It also introduces Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus (mentioned above) as Clouseau's boss and Burt Kwouk as Clouseau's long-suffering servant, Kato (""Cato"" in later films).

The film is in a word--hilarious.  There is continuous sight gags, verbal jokes, slapstick, mispronunciations, etc.  Peter Sellers is incredible and appears to be at his comic zenith.  Herbert Lom as the commissioner is fantastic as he becomes more nervous and frustrated as the film progresses.  In fact, the entire cast is superb.  (It must have been extremely difficult for them to keep a straight face and not break up laughing.)

The last scene is especially funny.  In my opinion, this scene is one of the most hilarious scenes ever filmed!!  (Peter Sellers himself almost breaks out laughing.  Also, if you listen very carefully, near the beginning of this scene, you'll actually hear one of the technical crew laughing.)

The background music by Henry Mancini is--unforgettable.  Don't be surprised if you catch yourself humming it after the movie is over.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two somewhat disappointing extras.

In conclusion, this film is a Peter Sellers' masterpiece, a tribute to a comic genius!!

141319,4,0792834917,"What a joy to this in widescreen on DVD and on a big TV. I hadn't seen it for many many years and so previously it would have been panned and scanned on an old TV. This is the 2nd of the Pink Panther films and perhaps the best of the lot. Peter Sellers plays Clouseau. He is an incompentent French Police Inspector investigating a murder at a rich socialites mansion. A beautifully straight-faced performance by George Sanders - although if you have seen some of the out-takes!

The film is awash with brilliant sight gags, almost too many to list. Many involve Sellers, but frequently Herbert Lom. His is a marvellous performance. As the Police Commissioner, and Clouseau's boss he is slowly driven literally insane by Clouseau and probably steals the acting honours from Sellers in the process.

A special mention must also go to Henry Mancini. He wrote the famous original Pink Panther theme and here he is spot on with the music soundtrack. Many scenes are enhanced by his witty musical motifs that fit perfectly to the action on the screen.

141321,5,0792834917,"Yes, a line from this film inspired the title of an REM album....

I love all of Peter Seller's performances as Inspector Clouseau. I grew up watching ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" (my favorite of the series back when I was a tween/teen) and ""The Revenge of the Pink Panther."" Later I dug up and watched the early films from the series and learned just how talented Peter Sellers was. The earlier films (""The Pink Panther"", ""A Shot in the Dark"" and ""The Return of the Pink Panther"") have less slapstick humor and more physical humor. Although ""The Pink Panther"" is better, classier and funnier film, ""A Shot in the Dark"" has some unforgettable moments: The Nudist Colony; the assassin leaving a trail of (mistakenly killed) bodies as he follows Maria & Clouseau from nightclub to nightclub; Dreyfus' signature line: ""Give me ten men like Clouseau and I could destroy the world"" and, running through it all, Clouseau's blind yet unerring belief in Maria's innocence (in *spite* of the ever increasing trail of bodies that follows in her wake).

For a truly great film with a stellar cast try 1964's ""The Pink Panther""... the best PP of all (basically ""The Thinking Man's Panther""). ""A Shot in the Dark"" shows that the PP series can be funny without crude humor. ""Revenge of the Pink Panther"" is an overlooked gem (and my second favorite... or tied with second with SitD). Latter PP films are great mindless films, but lack the class and style of the first three.

141328,5,0792834917,"The second of the five Pink Panther features (I don't count 1982's Trail of the Pink Panther since it was mainly deleted scenes and outtakes cobbled together from previous films), A Shot in the Dark (1964) was the first to actually star Peter Sellers (What's New, Pussycat, The Party, Murder by Death) in his signature role as the ever bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau (The original Pink Panther film featured David Niven as a well to do cat burglar, while Seller's role as Clouseau was more of a supporting one).  Produced, directed, and co-written by Blake Edwards (""Peter Gunn"", The Party, Revenge of the Pink Panther), the other co-writer being William Peter Blatty (The Exorcist), the film includes Elke Sommer (Baron Blood), Herbert Lom (Spartacus), George Sanders (Village of the Damned), Tracy Reed (Casino Royale), Graham Stark (The Return of the Pink Panther), and Burt Kwouk (You Only Live Twice).

As the film begins we see various figures furtively sneaking about a large, French chateau, punctuated by some gunshot ringing out in the night.  We soon learn a passionate Spaniard chauffeur has been murdered, and a housekeeper named Maria Gambrelli (Sommer) is prime suspect, due to the fact she was found in the room with the body, holding a smoking gun in her hand.  As it turns out the murder occurred on the estate of a wealthy businessman named Benjamin Ballon (Sanders) and Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Sellers), mistakenly assigned to the case, soon makes the scene, along with his assistant Hercule (Stark)...I say mistakenly as given the prominence of those involved, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Lom), who despises Clouseau with a passion due to his bumbling antics, would have never knowingly allowed Clouseau to investigate such a delicate case.  Anyway, Clouseau is quickly removed from the investigation but is soon re-instated as interested parties, for reasons unknown, pull a few strings on his behalf.  As Clouseau blunders his way forward, he's convince Maria didn't commit the murder, and that she's covering for someone else, but one wonders if Clouseau's belief stems from the fact he's quickly falling for the accused.  Things go seriously awry as Clouseau tries various methods to determine the identity of the killer, which really only results in two thing, the first being an increasing body count as various members of the Ballon household suffer deaths by unnatural causes, and the second being to drive Chief Inspector Dreyfus further and further to the brink of insanity.  Not only that, but a mysterious assassin is on the loose, intent on killing Clouseau himself!  Things eventually come to a head once Clouseau gathers all interested parties in one room, the intent being to expose the killer who he surely believes is among the group.

Many would say A Shot in the Dark is the best among the Pink Panther films, and I'd be hard pressed to argue, but I've always been partial to The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976), the one where Dreyfus, after escaping an asylum, threatens to destroy the world unless in an effort to coerce the nations of the world to send their best assassins to eliminate Clouseau once and for all.  While A Shot in the Dark may not have been as screwball as some of the later Pink Panther films, it's still extremely funny, entertaining and worth most anyone's time given the strength of the writing and the wonderful performances.  Sellers is, well Sellers, the bumbling, awkward, nincompoop of a detective who, somehow always manages to come out on top (but not without a few bumps and bruises along the way).  It's difficult picturing anyone else in the role after seeing Sellers' performances, but we were given the opportunity to do so with a 2006 release starring Steve Martin.  I have yet to see the new film, but I really have no desire to do so as I don't think it will live up to the originals.  Sellers had perfected the role, and I have little interest in seeing someone else trying to top something I doubt could be topped.  Anyway, Sellers is helped along the way with great performances by Herbert Lom, as Clouseau's beleaguered supervisor and Graham Stark as Clouseau's unfortunate assistant.  Throw in a lot humorous dialogue, goofy situations galore, and Henry Mancini's memorable scoring and you've got one heck of a comedic adventure.  Some of my more favored parts of the film include the running gags, particularly the one where Clouseau dons any number of disguises, all of which end up in him being arrested for various misdemeanors (in one scene he's disguised as a street vendor selling balloons in order to follow Maria unnoticed, but he's quickly arrested as he doesn't possess a street vendor's license).  Another great sequence occurs when Clouseau tries to follows Maria surreptitiously into a nudist colony, and he can't gain entrance until he strips down himself.  I've never seen so many carefully place set pieces as to obscure all the naughty bits inappropriate for a PG rated film.  And then there are the various bits with Clouseau's manservant Kato (in the later films he's known as Cato), played by Burt Kwouk, who's instructed by his employer to attack Clouseau when he least expects it, if only to continually improve his employers ability to deal with the unexpected.  Finally there's the finale, as Clouseau gathers those remaining in one room, and gets a whole lot more than he bargained for once the revelations begin coming at a furious pace.  All in all this is a terrific murder/mystery comedy, one worth watching more than once.

The picture, presented in both widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) and fullscreen (1.33:1), looks very clean, and the Dolby Digital mono audio, available in both English and French, comes through clearly.  As far as extras, there's an eight page booklet, an original theatrical trailer, and subtitles in English and French.  There's also a hidden feature, one that can be found by clicking on the title on the main menu, revealing a vintage promotional ad.

141330,5,0792834917,"Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty, the latter of whom would eventually write THE EXORCIST (both the novel and the film), were working on adapting a stageplay by Marcel Achard and Harry Kurnitz when Edwards had the idea of turning it into a vehicle for the character of Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers), the bumbling French policeman with the thick accent from Edwards' caper comedy THE PINK PANTHER.  The result is A SHOT IN THE DARK, released the same year as its predecessor (1964).

The film opens with a wonderful little sequence which culminates in a murder at the home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders).  Inspector Jacques Clouseau is mistakenly assigned to the case.  Though the evidence screams that the Ballon home's maid, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), is responsible for the murder, Clouseau is captivated by her beauty and refuses to believe it.  He sets out to prove Gambrelli's innocence as more and more evidence against her piles up, all the while driving his superior, Chief Inspector Dreyfuss (Herbert Lom), farther and farther up the wall.

A SHOT IN THE DARK is most certainly the finest of the Inspector Clouseau adventures.  It is at once a great comedy, a great PINK PANTHER film, and a great mystery.  Edwards and Blatty know what to do and when to do it, be it slapstick comedy or plays on Clouseau's thick accent.  The identity of the murderer remains completely unknown until the ending - you won't see it coming.  The endlessly inventive script comes up with one outrageous scene after another, resulting in one of the most fun and funny ""whodunnit""s ever made.

Henry Mancini's music has never been better.  His score, including a delightfully shady theme, is magnificent, possibly the finest of his career.  The film's original song, ""The Shadows Of Paris"", is great as well.  Mancini's score isn't always funny, however; there is a montage of scenes in the film where Clouseau is targeted for murder by an assassin.  The assassin's face is not revealed; we see only his gun and his gloved hand.  The way that director Edwards filmed this scenes, combined with Mancini's inhuman score, is to me quite horrifying.

Sellers is at his finest as the completely unreasonable, constantly bumbling Inspector Clouseau.  What would these films be without him?  It is painful to imagine someone else in the world.  It fits Sellers like his character's trademark coat.  A SHOT IN THE DARK also marks the first appearance of Kato (Burt Kwouk), Clouseau's servant and frequent ""attacker"".  Sommer and Lom are also great in their roles, particularly Lom as the increasingly loony Dreyfus.

If there is one PINK PANTHER film you must see, it's A SHOT IN THE DARK.  The film has become a true comedy classic, and rightfully so.  It's an immensely fun movie that will keep you guessing - and laughing - until the very end.",1155600000,12,2864,4.916666666666667

141333,4,0792834917,"""A Shot in the Dark"", apparently, was intended to be a screen adaptation of a murder mystery stage play.  Somehow, after the character of Inspector Clouseau caught on with audiences in ""The Pink Panther"", he got thrown into the mix here.  The result is a movie that established the very essence of the Pink Panther movie series: murder mysteries where the ""brilliant"" detective just happened to be a complete klutz with barely enough brain cells to mesh two clues together.

Peter Sellers once again assumes the role of that complete klutz, with even more hilarious results than in ""The Pink Panther.""

The film starts with a murder in the home of a French socialite, with so many shady characters creeping from room to room with lights coming on and off in true Pink Panther style that the audience isn't exactly sure who killed who.  Through a bureaucratic mistake, the bumbling Inspector Clouseau is sent in.  He meets the most obvious suspect, the beautiful, busty, blonde Elke Sommers, who shares top billing with Sellers.  Trusting his hormones rather than the evidence, Clouseau launches a hilarious one-man campaign to prove the blonde's innocence.

A cast of supporting players that would become Pink Panther regulars is established here.  Herbert Lom is Clouseau's twisted boss Commissioner Dreyfus.  Burt Kwouk is Clouseau's Korean butler who engages in frequent training excercises with his master.  Graham Stark, a close friend of Sellers, plays Clouseau's straight-laced side kick.  The character wouldn't appear again until ""Trail of the Pink Panther"", although the actor would go on the play multiple roles throughout the rest of the series.

Henry Mancini scores again, but since Pink Panther wasn't intended to be the name of the franchise at the time, the famous theme music is gone.  The new theme, however, is just as catchy and definitely could only be created by Mancini.  The animated Pink Panther lurking around during the opening credits is also missing, though a new cast of animated characters takes his place.

Based on a mystery play, the movie is able to lampoon the conventions of murder mysteries pretty well, down to the drawing room conclusion.  While the solution to the mystery is scattered, confusing, and almost non-existent, that's not really the point.  Pink Panther films are about the comic misadventures of Peter Sellers' character, never about the plot.

With Clouseau finally portrayed as the hero rather than the film's antagonist, ""A Shot in the Dark"" sets the tone for the rest of the Pink Panther series better than ""The Pink Panther"" does, though the funniest sequels were still to come.",1149897600,4,2638,5.078886310904872

The plot - something to do with a murder and a false suspect and a slew of other suspects - is secondary; in fact, it hardly matters at all. The focus of the movie is where it should be - on Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. The gags, many of them sight gags, never stop, and most are right on the money.

Where the first Pink Panther movie hadn't defined Clouseau enough, and the later ones strained for humorous effects (or repeated themselves), this movie is fresh and energetic - and very funny. Definitely worth a watch.(One of the few movies in this long series that doesn't have Pink Panther in its title, mainly because that is the name of a jewel and this movie has nothing to do with the jewel.)",1130630400,7,759,4.382978723404255
141344,5,0792834917,"In many ways, ""A Shot in the Dark"" is the first of the Clouseau films.  In the original movie Clouseau was simply the bumbling cuckolded detective without a clue while David Niven was the star jewel thief going after the famous diamond, the eponymous Pink Panther.  However, in this movie all the elements that make a ""Pink Panther"" movie take shape.

The elements are: Clouseau is the central focus of the film. His manservant, Kato, is present and their training karate duels provide amazingly funny scenes usually ending with a ridiculous explosion.  Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is Clouseau's boss and is insane with his hatred of Clouseau.  There are beautiful women who are strangely available to Clouseau much like ""Bond Girls"".  There are plenty of cartoon bombs, ridiculous disguises, and plenty of laughs.

In this film the beautiful woman is Elke Sommer. Sommer is a stunning beauty.  Here she is a very affectionate and much too innocent maid in a rich household  with many other servants and wealthy owners.  One evening, when everyone is in beds other than their own, a man is shot to death.  Sommer's character, Maria Gambrelli, is the obviously guilty party and everyone intends to railroad her to jail.  Except that Clouseau knows she is innocent.  He really hasn't a clue why she is innocent except for some vague intuition.  The rest of the movie sets up Clouseau stumbling into more trouble and at the last moment, as in all the films, the guilty party is revealed and Clouseau is the hero who deserves credit for sticking with his hunch, but never having a clue as to why he was right.

In many ways, this is the best of the Clouseau films because all of the later films are derivative of the formula laid down here.  Oh, and one other delight in all the films are the various roles that Graham Stark played in each of them.  He is fabulous.  What a face and what delivery!",1106956800,8,1903,4.697885196374623

This character ranks as one the greatest comic creations in film history.  As a bonus, Inspector Dreyfus(Herbert Lom), Clouseau's long-suffering superior and Cato (Burt Kwouk), Clouseau's manservant are introduced here.  There is one amusing set-piece after another in this film.  My personal favorites are Clouseau's interrogation of Elke Sommer and Clouseau trying to navigate his way through a nudist colony.  If you want to introduce someone to great screen comedy this is as good a starting point as any.",1094515200,,748,5.296610169491525
141349,5,0792834917,"This is one of the very rare films where the sequel is better than the original. This movie is absolutely a letter perfect comedy: suave yet silly; understated yet over the top; pompous yet reserved. You get the idea. A perfect film. I wouldn't change one thing about this movie, even if I could. Peter Sellers defines the bumbling Clouseau as an individual better here than in the original, and I think the supporting cast is stronger as well. Elke Sommer is perfect as the beautiful, naive murder suspect who Clouseau goes to any ends to defend, while George Sanders is wonderful as the great scoundrel millionaire, Benjamin Ballon. Introduced for the first time in the series are Bert Kwouk as Kato (later spelled 'Cato'), Graham Stark as Clouseau's (extremely) patient assistant, Hercule, and my favorite of all the Panther supporting characters, the great Herbert Lom as Inspector Dreyfus. Watching Lom go through the phases of psychosis in this film is one of the greatest experiences and delights a person can have as a movie viewer. (I particularly like his performance in the closing scene, and when reading the newspaper with trembling hands and twitching eye.)
The plot concerns Clouseau's infatuation with a wrongly accused murder suspect, and the chaos that develops from that unlikely situation. The film is filled with a degree of nuance seldom seen in a comedy, and is probably the best crafted of all the Panther films (although I have to admit that the way over the top ""Pink Panther Strikes Again"" is my personal favorite.) The physical comedy that Sellers could make totally natural (watch the ""spinning globe"" scene for an excellent example) is still unrivalled, and the nuanced interplay with other cast members is better than in any other comedy that I can think of (to see what I mean watch the ""curved pool cue"" scene and the interaction of both Monsieur Ballon and the butler.)
I highly recommend this film. The DVD print is good, though there are few extras (the original trailer is very amusing and a tad on the weird side.) It is slapstick, but it is very refined slapstick done by the master, Peter Sellers. If only they still made movies like this today. I give it five stars only because Amazon won't allow more!",1088726400,44,2244,4.8311688311688314
141350,4,0792834917,"I gotta be honest: before watching this movie, I had seen clips of this and one or two other Inspector Clouseau movies on TV, and I've never really found him all that funny. I'd usually wince more often than I'd laugh at his idiotic physical behavior. Now that I've watched A SHOT IN THE DARK, though, I see a perspective of his classic comedy character that I didn't see in those short clips. I still can't say I'm a big fan of Clouseau, but, at the very least, A SHOT IN THE DARK made me laugh pretty heartily at times---more than I expected.
I dunno...I've just never truly responded to these films' brand of slapstick. Those constant falls and accidents of Clouseau's always seem to irritate me more than amuse me. I know Clouseau is stupid, but did he really need to be THIS stupid? That last sequence at the Ballon household, for instance, seems to go on forever because this cop carelessly keeps stepping on people's toes and falling down from couches and doors, etc etc. It's not funny; it's simply repetitive, and it annoyingly slows down the film at certain points.
Fortunately, Inspector Clouseau's idiocy isn't totally physical. There are, for instance, a few funny jokes involving Clouseau and his assistant Hercule. Clouseau recites all the facts of a case (""Facts, Hercule, facts!...Without them the science of criminal investigation is nothing more than a guessing game""), asks Hercule what he makes of the facts, and when Hercule responds with the most obvious conclusion to be drawn from them, Clouseau cries out ""You idiot! Only an amateur detective would say something like that!"" Amusing indeed. That's the kind of satirical humor I responded to most in A SHOT IN THE DARK, and there's enough of it that saves this movie from simply being asinine.
That, and some genuinely funny sequences: Clouseau's scenes with Cato, his inadvertently going undercover in a nudist colony, and the sequences involving the unlucky assassin. There is a brilliantly filmed sequence in the prologue, leading up to the movie's first murder; and the animated credits (without a pink panther in sight) is always fun to look at. Herbert Lom is also pretty funny as the increasingly crazy Inspector Dreyfus, who is slowly going mad b/c of the mess Clouseau is making of the Ballon case. As for Peter Sellers, he's admittedly very good in the role of the bumbling inspector, but his full comic brilliance can be glimpsed elsewhere (Kubrick's DR. STRANGELOVE, for example).
All the good elements help make A SHOT IN THE DARK a fairly entertaining, pretty funny time. To me, though, it is not the comedy classic everyone says it is. If you want to see truly funny exploits of an utterly incompetent cop, see Leslie Nielsen in the NAKED GUN movies. You'll laugh a lot longer and harder at Lt. Frank Drebin's brand of comic stupidity than you will at the occasionally irritating Inspector Clouseau here.",1087948800,,2894,4.848484848484849
141351,4,0792834917,"A chapter in the myriad of Pink Panther films, this film is one of the best crafted and most hillarious in the series. Unlike the other films in the series, this film does not focus as much on the Pink Panther as on The Svejk-like inspector Clouseau himself. Valuable to a fan of the series it takes the time to provide a deeper insight into the character of the infamous and clumsy inspector. Investigating a murder in the house of the multimillionaire leads Clouseau to brilliantly farcical adventure, unexpected romance as he tries to defend his lovely object of affection from false accusations and yet a more unexpected conclusion to his case.
Clouseau's developed persona and the mishaps attached to it may be the highlight's of the film, but they do not compensate for the 2-dimensionality of the rest of the characters. There is little to the films secondary protagonist, Maria Gambrelli, as her only feature is a magnificent talent to attract bad luck and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Yes, having a well-developed character, Clouseau in this case, is very good, but it seems that there should be more Clouseau's in the film.
So, this dramatic production seems to have spread out a bit too thinly as it tries to focus on Clouseau, the case, and the sparked romance. If the director could perhaps chose a more defined focus, this film could have been improved greatly. Having said that, this film does a far better job in the field of comedy than most modern films that audaciously bear the title of ""comedy"". Highly recommended",1062460800,,1550,4.765799256505576

A SHOT IN THE DARK has somehow come up short with the younger fans for no good reason other than its title. It does not say ""Pink Panther"" yet once discovered A SHOT IN THE DARK is a true gem. A SHOT IN THE DARK is a great example of sophisticated slapstick (screenplay by Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty based on plays by Harry Kurnitz and Marcel Achard). A SHOT IN THE DARK has Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Kato, which THE PINK PANTHER did not. A SHOT IN THE DARK focuses on Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. It is really more character based and driven than THE PINK PANTHER. In many ways A SHOT IN THE DARK is much funnier. It really defines the character of Clouseau a good-natured inspector who just can not see the forest for the trees.

The opening shot (shots in the dark) and the nudist colony scenes are great examples of Blake Edwards' direction at his best.

A SHOT IN THE DARK has a much different look than the invigorating and opulent images found in THE PINK PANTHER. Henry Mancini once again delivers a very good score. A SHOT IN THE DARK's main title theme is very good but has been greatly overshadowed by THE PINK PANTHER theme. But can you blame it?

A killing has taken place in the home of the millionaire Ballon (George Sanders).  Due to an oversight, France's finest (ha ha!), Inspector Clouseau, has been assigned to the case.  He meets the suspect, the lovely maid Maria Gambrelli, and falls head over heels in love with her.  His superior, Commissioner Dreyfus, wants him off the case, but certain interested parties want to keep him on, so Dreyfus has no choice but to comply.  As the corpses pile on, Clouseau realizes he must catch the killer.  (For a comedy, this film sure has a high body count).
The body count is inversely proportional to Dreyfus's sanity.  He develops a twitch in his eye, he starts to giggle like a madman, and he injures himself twice in scenes involving a cigar cutter and a letter opener.  These scenes are topped in the cigarette lighter scene in Return Of The Pink Panther.
After misadventures in a nudist camp, a scene much touted for its hilarity, and a plan where he tries to draw Maria's lover in the open by taking her to public places, he gathers the entire Ballon household in a scene reminiscent of the denouements of Agatha Christie's Poirot mysteries.
There is a running gag as Clouseau shadows Maria in a variety of disguises, only to be stopped by an authority figure and asked if he has a license.  A bass chord sounds, followed by the sirens of a Black Mariah as it whizzes down the road, with the object relevant to his disguise hanging visible through the bars of the van.
The best of the above gags involves a pesky crow, a stone thrown at said bird, the bird getting back with a few white drops on Clouseaus hat, and a gunshot.  And then comes: I am the game warden.  Do you have a hunting license?  Chord, then the police van, with the crow hanging on a string from the bars.  Hilarious!
The billiard playing scene should serve as a direct warning to homeowners to invest in some Clouseau insurance.  Believe me, it will be worth it.
Elke Sommer is pretty as Maria Gambrelli but is no match for Lesley Anne Down (The Pink Panther Strikes Again).  She does outshine Capucine (The Pink Panther), Dyan Cannon (Revenge Of The Pink Panther), and Joanna Lumley (Trail Of The Pink Panther, Curse Of The Pink Panther), however.
Graham Stark plays Hercule, Clouseau's subordinate, who has a thankless time working for the bumbling idiot.  Hercule appears to be well-organized and sensible, and his rigid adherence to the facts doesn't seem to count for much in Clouseau's eye.
This is also the movie where three actors became regulars of the series and hence established their recognition.  They are of course, Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus, Burt Kwouk as Cato, and Andre Maranne as Francois.
 One dialogue goof did not escape from the final print.  When Clouseau confronts Ballon, he says, ""I put it to you, Inspector Ballon"" instead of ""I put it to you, Monsieur Ballon.""  Inspector?  I suppose that shows even Peter Sellers wasn't word perfect.
I must say that Cato's opening scene will be the most effective for first time viewers of this comedy classic, although for those of us who have seen this countless times, it's an eagerly anticipated scene.
Director and producer Blake Edward's partner in crime for the screenplay was William Peter Blatty (!!) of you-know-what movie with Linda Blair fame.  And NO, Inspector Clouseau did NOT vomit gallons of Pepto Bismol all over Dreyfus or Monsieur Ballon.  I don't know, though.  That would've been funny as heck!",998179200,4,3611,4.76083467094703
141365,5,0792834917,"""A Shot In The Dark"" is the first sequel to ""The Pink Panther"". Or, it is the first in the series of Inspector Clouseau movies. Take your pick. Peter Sellers, as Clouseau, was part of the ensemble cast that made ""The Pink Panther"" such an excellent movie. But Blake Edwards quickly realized that he had stumbled onto something special. ""A Shot In The Dark"" was the first movie where Inspector Clouseau was the main character. It also introduced Clouseau's boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), and Kato (Bert Kwouk), both of whom became fixtures throughout the rest of the series. On the other hand, it continues with the pink panther animation and the Henry Mancini theme from ""The Pink Panther"", despite the fact that this is the only film in the series that doesn't have ""The Pink Panther"" in the title. Nor is the mythical diamond in the plot.
All this aside, the formula that developed with this movie is a good one. Sellers is hilarious as Clouseau and, of the Clouseau series, this one is the most tightly plotted and works the best. A chauffer in a wealthy household is shot dead in a room belonging to a maid. The maid is found with the gun in her hand. Clouseau, mistakenly assigned to the case, is smitten by the maid (Elke Sommer) and is determined to prove her innocent. A madcap caper with a surprise ending ensues. The scene in the nudist camp is the most famous, but this movie is riddled with funny lines and hilarious scenes.
Sellers was a brilliant comedian, and this is possibly his best movie. If you're a fan of Sellers work, you can't be without this one. If you're unfamiliar with Sellers, this is an excellent chance to give him a try. In any event, this one's a classic. One that anybody with a sense of humor can enjoy. I recommend it very highly.",987897600,,1781,4.5514018691588785

141368,5,0792834917,"You've got the best mix of everything with this one. Clouseau is the main character, not Niven; the plot is darkly playful (you could populate a village with all the people that die in this film); you get Kato and  Dreyfus; you get that 60's Parisian atmosphere; you get a classic Mancini  spy/caper score and a world of great scenes and hilarious dialouge.  But...its the way it all COMES TOGETHER. This movie has a confidence to it  that's freaky. It's great in an automatic sort of way. Everyone involved  must have felt it. For Blake Edwards, the first film most likely served as  barometer as to where to go with the next one. That's the great thing about  sequels...the filmmakers can say, ""Ok, the first one was good, but now  that people are familiar with the character(s), let's do THIS..""
