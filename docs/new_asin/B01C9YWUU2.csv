7673350,5,B01C9YWUU2,"Ermahgerd, so amazing. Not only is this such a good price for this dvd set, it also came with a surprise free gift!! That was so sweet!! Perfect quality dvd, everything came in good condition and right on time. ^__^",1466899200,,215,4.4
7673351,5,B01C9YWUU2,Movie was just as described.  3 movies on 1 disk.  All very good quality.  Would definitely buy again.,1466380800,,102,4.555555555555555
7673352,5,B01C9YWUU2,"This seems to be the best, least expensive collection of the live-action movies surrounding Death Note. If you are only familiar with the Anime, it definitely goes in a different direction, and only the first two are truly ""Death Note"" (the third is a movie starring ""L""). The acting is not spectacular, but decent enough, and you can listen in either subbed or dubbed formats, as the main actors did their own dubbing so they ""sound right"" in both languages. I wish it was available on BR instead of ""merely"" double-layer DVD, but, ah, well. It's the only reasonably inexpensive way to get all three in Region 1 format that I am aware of.",1461628800,8,639,4.614035087719298
7673353,2,B01C9YWUU2,"The movie itself is an awesome movie but I was misled as to what I ordered , I was under the impression I was getting a multi dvd set , instead I got what looks like a bootleg video on one disc , like all 3 movies crammed on 1 disc.",1460332800,7,232,3.5686274509803924
8752589,3,B01C9YWUU2,"The first two movies weren't bad, but they can't hold a candle to the manga and anime.
The third one probably should never have been made. I actually preferred its novel adaptation.",1530144000,,181,4.6875
8752590,5,B01C9YWUU2,"All movies on one disc, Japanese and English Dub, and English dub optional. And only 12$? Great deal!
Love the cover of the DVD case.

Movie 1: 4 stars - great set up

Movie 2: 5 stars - better ending then the anime

Movie 3: 3 and half stars - L is great!

Whole series: 5 stars - solid adaption of Death Note. Netflix wil never beat these movies.",1490313600,2,348,4.0
8752591,5,B01C9YWUU2,Thank you,1489708800,,9,4.0
8752592,5,B01C9YWUU2,Love it,1485734400,,7,3.0
8752593,5,B01C9YWUU2,I tried looking for this set of movies but could only find them separate and for much more. The third alone was 100 so this is a serious bargain if you liked the anime you will love the movies. I know I do! It is one disc but it looks quite professional to me! Highly recommend it.,1482796800,2,281,3.9473684210526314
8752594,5,B01C9YWUU2,"My only issue with this set is it's not movies 1-3. It's the first 2 movies and L Change the World which is a companion movie and not the actual titled Death Note 3. It works great though and with as hard to find as any of them are, it's a great price",1482105600,2,251,3.7547169811320753
8752595,5,B01C9YWUU2,Amazing. Arrived earlier than expected. This is one of the best live action animes I've ever seen. And it's awesome for the price for  all three movies!,1480118400,,152,4.62962962962963
8752596,4,B01C9YWUU2,"I remember when I had just the dvd for the first movie, it had three different subtitle options. Off, on, and another setting where it only showed up when Japanese text was shown. Now, since the subtitles were meant for the Japanese audio, they aren't accurate for the English audio and while the subtitles do include the Japanese text translations, it would be a lot nicer to have them separate again.",1479859200,,402,4.676056338028169
8752597,5,B01C9YWUU2,"As a fan of the Anime Death Notes, yes I'm 69 and like the quality Animes, I thought I'd give this one a try with real actors. It is not HD but good standard quality.  It is dubbed in english with easy on and off subtitles so you can read the Japanese signs and newspapers.  Surprisingly, it is not just a regular movie but the entire Anime series, note ""1 & 2 & 3"" in the label, with real actors except for the Shinigami who is computerized to perfection.  ""L"" is just as weird in this movie as he is in the Anime!  The other characters aren't bad in following the original Anime.  There are few movies made from drama story Anime's.  This is one and a good one.",1471219200,6,663,4.10077519379845
8752598,4,B01C9YWUU2,"The sound and video was very good quality, but if you watch it in English the mouth flaps don't match up perfectly with the words. Of course, that's because the actors are actually speaking Japanese and the voice actors just dubbed it in English, so it's impossible to make it perfect. Still, it was done well, and they used the same voice actors as in the English dubbed anime, which I was so happy about because they were awesome! There was a major scene in the anime that they didn't include in the movies and that greatly disappointed me. Still great movies, (especially the 2nd one) and they did a great job with it! Definitely worth the money!",1469750400,,649,4.508474576271187
