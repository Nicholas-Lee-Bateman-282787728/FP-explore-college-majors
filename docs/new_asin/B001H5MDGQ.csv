3624013,5,B001H5MDGQ,Another excellent season featuring the Judge's professional and personal challenges.  It's the complexity of each episode that makes this series so good.,1425513600,,153,5.954545454545454

3624028,5,B001H5MDGQ,"His extra curricular behavior spices up the enjoyment of getting some insight into how the British judicial system works.  Many things have changed in the last 15-20 years naturally, but you can hardly go wrong when Martin Shaw is involved..  He's become such a class act since his shoot-em-up days.  And G.F. Newman's writing and production are sterling.",1391126400,,355,5.086206896551724

3624030,5,B001H5MDGQ,"This modern time drama ""Judge John Deed"" in the court room and in the judges' chambers is as great entertainment as was""The Garrow's Law "" in Old Bailey in London. I have seen all the seasons now and there is only one thing I am not pleased about - there are no more  ""John Deed ""after season 6.",1377648000,,295,4.086206896551724

3624032,5,B001H5MDGQ,"Excellent program-Martin Shaw continues to entertain as a sharp-witted judge, giving the ""establishment"" what for. The cast around him only serves to highlight his talent.",1373155200,,171,5.88
3624033,5,B001H5MDGQ,I am truly enjoying everyone of these DVD's.  I hardly ever watch what is on TV today but have truly enjoyed the older British Movies and TV series.,1365638400,,148,4.285714285714286
3624034,5,B001H5MDGQ,purchased all 6 seasons and loved them all can't wait to be able to get season 7 if it is ever released. Martin shaw is terrific as Judge Deed. I defiantly would recommend it to all.,1360368000,,182,4.083333333333333
3624035,5,B001H5MDGQ,"While I like the series, the real fun is wathcing how many politicalaly correct and Liberal theories they can jam into the show. Be it animal rights or gun control- it is all there!",1357257600,,181,4.352941176470588
3624046,4,B001H5MDGQ,"In the series ""Judge John Deed"" Martin Shaw fits the role perfectly. The series are first-rate British fare. The stories are well-written, superbly acted by a great cast, really absorbing and provide a peek at the British legal system. If you like the Brit stuff, you will love this.",1346976000,,283,4.795918367346939
3624047,5,B001H5MDGQ,"I enjoyed the pilot show and Series 1 very much,so I was hoping Series 2 was as good and I was not disappointed. Deed is a flawed character in his personal life but just the right person on the bench to dispence justice.",1344211200,2,220,4.1395348837209305
3624048,5,B001H5MDGQ,"Leave it to the English! This series is standout drama. The acting is a marvel to behold. The spoken word refreshing, invigorating, erudite.

3624050,4,B001H5MDGQ,"My family enjoyed Judge John Deed Season 1 so much we decided to purchase Season 2. We were not disappointed, all the episodes were great. Martin Shaw is one of the nations greatest actors. We highly recommend this new set of DVD's.",1296518400,4,232,4.5476190476190474
3624051,5,B001H5MDGQ,"Martin Shaw has created a very complex character who on the bench is brilliant but in his personal life not so clever, getting himself into complications and tight situations that make one question his judgement. The cast is full of accomplished actors and their varied characters brilliantly add to the stories in each episode. My only complaint is that 4 episodes do not make a season in my thinking. I hope season three has more episodes. A bit like giving us 4 episodes of Boston Legal and calling it a season. Still better than MOST of what we get in the US!",1293753600,9,563,4.529411764705882
3624052,5,B001H5MDGQ,See my review of season one.  The cases are again varied and the acting performances by the cast is first-rate.  The show is addictive.  If you like the Law and Order series and Boston Legal you'll really enjoy this series.,1292544000,2,223,4.525
3624053,5,B001H5MDGQ,He also likes women.  The acting is very good.  The lady that plays opposite him is a real asset to the show.  He really is for justice even if he has to step on some toes.  He believes firm punishment if they deserve it or not.,1291075200,3,228,3.891304347826087
