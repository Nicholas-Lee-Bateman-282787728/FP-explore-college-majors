8090296,4,B000BOWPR6,"Cowboy Bebop is the anime for people who don't really care for anime.  It has humor AND drama (lacking out of most TV programming these days).  However, if you can't get past it being a cartoon, don't bother.",1142899200,,208,4.447368421052632
8090297,5,B000BOWPR6,"If you buy this version from Amazon and not one of the super-discounted other sellers, you won't get a bootleg, so don't worry.  Overall it's a great collection, but I should mention that they are just the loose disks and don't come in any sort of ""collector's box.""  I bought these as a gift so would have liked a box, but... oh well!  The dvds themselves are super-nice quality.",1134950400,2,380,4.478260869565218
8090298,5,B000BOWPR6,"For some reason, I never really got into Cowboy Bebop since my first introduction to the series was through the dubbed version on Cartoon Network, and despite my full realization that all dubbed versions are nothing compared to the original, I was still never drawn in by the series. I finally got myself to go get the series and it sure did not disappoint. There are bits of comedy mixed with great action sequences. The fact that most of the series is spent on side adventures is interesting. On one hand, I would have liked to see Faye's past develop further and Spike's history with the Syndicate to be less vague; but on the other hand, just those few snippets and clips of flashbacks allow the viewer's imagination to wander, something few anime series are able to do. Each character develops into their own and that is one of the greatest strengths of this series. One thing that sets Cowboy apart from others is its ending. Too often are viewers mired by complete and utter BAD endings where producers simply try to fit everything and try to tie everything together. It is a thin balance between overdoing it and not doing enough. Bebop is able to walk that thin line perfectly. Another notable strength is its music and the abundance of original tracks that really add to create that unique atmosphere. Although Bebop is not a groundbreaking work in a sense that it can stand alone in a genre of itself, it certainly is a fresh anime that is so enjoyable and fun.",1134086400,3,1472,4.600760456273764
8090299,5,B000BOWPR6,"If you're a fan of the series, why not but this box set? It's about $20 cheaper than buying all of the session DVDs seperate (it's even cheaper than buying the newly issued remix DVDs). If you're planning to buy the DVDs, this is definitely the way to go.",1131321600,3,255,4.224489795918367
