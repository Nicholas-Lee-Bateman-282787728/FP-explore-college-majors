1690817,5,B000063JZS,"This video is really good because it teaches kids that everyone is special even if you are a bat, in the second episode , they find a bat in the attic of the big blue house and everyone is scared of it , but bear says that everyone is different and not to be scared. I liked this one alot, my son loves bear, he has almost all of his videos.",1173484800,3,341,3.816901408450704
1690818,4,B000063JZS,"Bear does it again teaching children while entertaining at the same time. This is a good way to keep you child busy while they learn. Bear teaches values and helpful information such as seasons, shapes, colors, potty training, brushing teeth, bathing, sharing, friendship, and alot more.",1173139200,,287,5.260869565217392

1690821,5,B000063JZS,"When I saw the three episodes of ""Bear..."" on this DVD I was very impressed. I have to say it turned the series into my favorite program to share with my son.

The disc starts with an episode dealing with Opposites, and it shows how important it is for opposites to exist, in order to completement us where we fall short  (Bear's chat with Tutter in the kitchen when the mouse is struggling to reach a glass, and then Bear has a hard time reaching a spoon that he dropped under the fridge are a great example of this).

The second episode showcases Benny ""the bat"", a new fella to most  of the animals in the Big Blue House, which gives most of them the creeps. As Bear and Treelo introduce them to the winged friend, they begin to realize that as different as he looks, they all share something in common with him.

Last, the closing episode emphasizes charity as a value, as the entire crowd in the house pulls together to organize a yardsale to benefit the muskrat's who lost their homes. Intertwined with some fun moments with Tutter's undecided about letting go some of his junk, this episode takes the whole concept home, leaving behind a trail of great benefit for your child to learn from.

After this DVD, I declare myself a fan of Bear! ""Welcome to the Blue House!""",1112572800,17,1275,4.427350427350428
1690822,5,B000063JZS,"My 17 month old son loves this video. He would watch bear in the big blue house and Elmo all day if we did not turn it off. He even askes for it by name.. when standing by the tv he says ""bear?"". It is not something that a parent can watch too many times in one day as it gets old, but I find myself singing the songs with the show and dancing silly, but hey it makes my son laughs and that is all that I need.",1067299200,5,410,3.6179775280898876

1690875,5,B000063JZS,"Love it! I can think of a few adults who could stand to learn a lesson or two from Bear! This dvd focuses on moral and social lessons and values that are important for preschoolers and elementary school aged children to know. This helps to teach respect, helping out, getting along, etc. Kids need to understand these things when they are in school and other social settings in order to make friends.

The title ""Everybody's Special"" might be a turn off for those who are afraid to teach their kids they are a ""special snowflake"" or deserve special treatment and feel entitled. This is not the case in this situation. Rather than saying you're entitled to special treatment because you are unique or whatever, this teaches that everyone deserves respect and care because everyone is special and unique.

Another show I recommend for teaching mutual respect and friendship skills is the show Ni Hao Kai Lan. It's a lot like Dora the Explorer but the little girl is Chinese. Instead of going on adventures, she explores different feelings and common scenarios which take place in friendships among children. Kids also learn words in Mandarin while learning to deal with feelings and be respectful of others.",1421366400,,1205,4.873170731707317
1690876,5,B000063JZS,"This tackles some pretty serious issues in a very light hearted and fun way, it uses the other characters fear of a bat to teach children about discrimination and judging a book by its cover.  Its really pretty impressive.",1420675200,,222,4.6923076923076925
