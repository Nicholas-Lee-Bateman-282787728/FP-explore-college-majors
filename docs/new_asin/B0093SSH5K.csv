8535351,1,B0093SSH5K,"Beware if you are buying this DVD to enjoy here in the US. This version has no English. Only Spanish and Italian. The picture looks pretty good. It is widescreen (non-anamorphic) but if you are English, you won't understand it. I realize this is a Spain pressing, but at least have the movie in its original language! No movie should be dubbed in the first place, let alone the ONLY pressing of LUCY GALLANT in the world!! This saddens me because this wonderful classic needs to have a legit release here in the states in anamorphic widescreen with its English audio in tact.
I am so thankful for the seller being kind enough to give me a full refund because of this glitch.
Maybe one day Paramount or some other legit company will give this classic the respect it deserves and release it on DVD.",1347494400,4,796,4.496551724137931
