8740506,4,B017S6LJ9O,"I enjoyed all of the ""Hunger Games"" movies for their entertainment value and the wonderful skills of the talented actors. The determining factor that inspired me to issue a 4-star rating rather than 5 stars is my personal belief that, had I not read the trilogy prior to viewing the movie versions, I would have been a bit confused at times due to the lack of detail and background information to explain the logic and reasoning behind a few of the characters' specific attitudes and responses to certain situations. That said; I would recommend the movies to audiences from age 16 and up.",1483401600,,589,4.728155339805825
