8693685,1,B00R1JURTM,"So this movie is a recap, it contains all of the plethora of problems the original show has including plot holes galore, poorly written characters, and a wish forfilment main character that's one of the worst anime protags from popular anime in recent memory with only Natsu coming close. Of course with the anime getting popular these days being as meh as they are, this is saying a lot. But to make it worse they add in fan service scenes of Kirito's harem in a pool which makes this movie unwatchable. I couldn't even finish it because I was so disgusted at a part where what is probably legally sexual harassment is played up as ""cute girls being silly.""",1447977600,2,658,4.53781512605042
8693686,4,B00R1JURTM,It was a good little movie but I don't think it's worth $50 or even $40. The first hour is pretty much a recap of the first season. With a little bikini action on the side as they teach sugu how to swim in preparation for an underwater dungeon. The last 30-40 minutes is them clearing the dungeon. It's a good little dungeon but they definitely could have made that part longer. In all it was a good movie but Its a bit over priced considering there is only an extra episode's worth of new content. I love SAO so I can't give I any less than 4 stars.,1447286400,3,550,4.055045871559633
