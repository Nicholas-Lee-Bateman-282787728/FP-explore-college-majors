8640327,1,B00IA7MF8K,"Would not support ""Brain Damaged Production"" even if it were a good movie.",1511395200,,74,4.769230769230769
8640328,5,B00IA7MF8K,"A man wakes up in total emptiness and feels the white walls.  He asks if anybody's here.  He gets angry and concerned when nobody replies.  He bites his hands and smears blood on the walls.  A computer is watching this man.  Someone's experimenting on him.  Perhaps an experiment on his emotional reaction to being alone, trapped and uncertain.  A hole in the floor opens up.  The man takes his shirt off and drop it in the hole.  The hole gets bigger.  Don't get much bigger or the man won't have any white wall to cling onto!

The man grabs his head in confusion and finds he's not bleeding after all.  A demonic cloaked figure climbs out of the hole and grabs the man's eyes.  Men pull the guy away as the experiment... is not over yet, at least not for the day (but it's over for this guy).  We see another man going through his own experiment.  He too is trapped in a white room.  He sits up in a bed and shakes.  We then see a woman roped in bed with her finger being snipped.  Now we see a man wake up in an office room and tied to a chair.  A man named Paperface appears right in front of him.  The confused man asks what's going on.  Paperface doesn't respond.  He says he hates being called Paperface and says to the man that this place is his factory.  He asks what Paperface wants.  His reply of ""It suits me well"" isn't a good answer yo.  Paperface says the man always liked wearing jackets.

The man calls Paperface an a hole and says to get him out of this thing.  Paperface mentions unraveling something and laughing about it.  The man laughs and teases his name.  ""P-p-p-p-paperface!""  Paperface says he can't understand this world.  He asks the man the girl's name, and it's Sarah.  The man says Sarah is his wife.  Paperface says ""I knew it!""  He opens a blanket with Sarah's finger inside.  The man gets upset so Paperface wraps tape around his mouth.  Screaming won't bring his wife's finger back.

Paperface electrocutes the man as he pees himself.  Ew, I'm not cleaning that up!  But wait!  The man wakes up alone still tied to the chair.  What happened to Paperface?  It appears he imagined this whole thing.  The man frees himself when he realizes how dreadful it is in here.  Paperface watches from behind a door.  The man walks around and kicks over a construction worker's hat.  He sees his wife lying on a bed mutilated.  She's barely alive and her legs are gone.  The man cries but crying won't put his wife together again.  The man strangles his wife to put her out of her blood coughing misery.  She jumps awake and continues her struggle to live.  The man beats his wife with a stick across her face.  Now she'll stop trying to live!  The man sees Paperface hiding in a locker.  He beats Paperface to death.  Paperface smiles before dying.  We see the man who was sitting up in bed earlier.  He's in jail.

The movie changes in a big unforgivable way after this.  From this point forward, everything becomes VERY different.  At first I was disappointed with this big change because the suspense so far is awesome, and the mystery concerning what these experiments are about and why these people are being experimented on really appealed to me.  But the movie goes in a more comedy-focused direction.

Now the picture's in black and white.  Oh no!  If you've ever seen a movie called Wingrave (and I really hope you never do) the movie works like this.  We see the characters speak, and their response appears in written words on the screen a moment later.  The whole time they carry a conversation there's ambient sounds.  We don't actually hear them speak except on a few occasions.  Normally when it comes to legitimate horror films I really dislike this approach but in this case, with POE: Project of Evil, it's brief (less than 10 minutes).  It just adds to the weirdness and comedy.

We see a man says to another ""Is this your seventh house?""  The man responds saying it's his eighth.  They mention some dude named Manero.  The man says to the other his statements on TV were irresponsible, and adds that he's pushing too far and will mess it up.  The man responds saying he didn't get the role.  I'm so confused right now!!!  He says he's not an actor, and the man questions if he should stop doing porn.  He replies the past can not be erased so he'll play dead.  We now see the man going through with a porno act with a woman.  Someone throws a plastic sheet over his face and he suffocates.  He says he's breathless but has to act like nothing is happening when people look at his him concerned, and he'll be okay.  We're still in Wingrave mode with the words appearing on screen.

The man finds himself in a room getting smacked on by men while he's defenseless and sitting on his chair.  He speaks to himself inside his head and says if the men touch him again he'll make them pay.  Wow I thought I was confused before.  I surely wasn't as bad off as I thought!  They stab and beat on the defenseless man.  He speaks in Italian and argues over weiner sizes... I guess.  This is all about making that Manero man happy, whoever he is.  The dangerous men cut off the guy's weiner.  He says the men will pay but again, he's only thinking this.  Not really saying it.  All these men beat on each other... I think.

We see the man continue his porn act so I guess his weiner made out okay despite being chopped off.  Pretty orchestration plays as we see a spoonful of drugs being made and needles injected into someone's skin.  We see a woman run to the toilet to throw up, and in another room a woman gets stabbed in the mouth by an intruder.  The woman who was throwing up is now tossed to the ground by the attacker and raped by a man in a monkey suit.  There are more considerate ways to please a lady you know.

The raped woman pops up off the floor after the rape and slices a man with his back turned.  The chained monkey tries to save the man but is unsuccessful.  The woman lays in bed crying.  We now see a man lying half naked in a field surrounded by cattle.  In town a man touches pretty female dresses in a store.  A man in a dark bar gets lost in a deep thought as another man has sex with a woman outside in front of a building gate.  We see people dancing around half naked outside.  The film appears to have traveled somewhere away from Italy by the looks of things.  Or maybe this is the countryside of Italy but the people aren't Italian looking to me.

We see a man by a campfire, and in the daylight he sits by a temple and gets toasted by the hot sun.  He disciplines himself by slapping his arm with a rope.  With his pants down he falls in a river.  He's now lying in a hospital bed... in a hospital.  The way this movie's going I'm surprised he's not lying in a hospital bed in an Canadian coffee shop.  We hear female tribal singing.  We now see a man walking up the stairs and sticking his hand out like he's inviting us to come along.  If I'm taken to sanity I'm on my way!  This whole segment is in black and white like earlier.  This time they actually speak to each other though.  We see two men having wine together and dressed in tuxedos.  The one man says he saw the other in a dream but his face was rotten.

Suddenly we hear screaming upstairs.  The man asks the guy if he saw the devil in this dream  he had.  We see a naked man squirming around on the floor above.  He grabs a plastic doll and hugs it.  The two men talk in a heavy hard to distinguish Italian accent so the conversation is hard to figure out.  A woman is now pleasuring herself in the same spot that man was holding the plastic doll.  Now the man is eating a guy's face in the same spot the woman was pleasuring herself.  A hamster crawls by.  Poor little guy!

We see two men covered in feathers approaching the two men who are having a discussion and drinking wine.  The other man asks if everything's alright because the feathered folks aren't really there and just part of the wine drinker's imagination... or are they real?  Both feathered gentlemen smile at the wine drinker.  He drinks straight from the bottle and I can't blame him.  The wine drinker says he's a doctor.  The other guy doesn't agree with that heavy accent he's sporting.  The wine drinker says it's time to go far away from here.  Far away from the feathered men and weird conversations.  When the wine drinker leaves the other guy remains and tells the feathered men with a hand gesture not to cry, so apparently he *can* see them after all.

He catches up to the wine drinker, leaving the feathered men to smile alone in that room.  He reveals to the wine drinker he's the face that always smiles behind the flesh and then proceeds to rip his face off.  Upstairs the guy died.  Not sure which guy died.  The guy holding the plastic doll I guess.  Or maybe it was the face eater.  The two men who walk in and examine the deceased guy's body take their clothes off and throw buckets of paint on each other as the orchestration gets lovely. We see paint cover one of the guys hands as they cover themselves in feathers and jump around like monkeys in the hallway.

We now see a man trapped in a dark space.  His lighter is his only light.  He looks worried something might find him, but what could he possibly be afraid of?  Think about it.  Given everything we've seen up to this point, there's a *lot* to be afraid of!  While looking at a picture a noise distracts the trapped guy.  He frantically carves into the ceiling with his bloody fingernails.  ""Get out of my head!""  Nah just kidding, I'm not losing my mind yet.  We see maggots and blood dripping from the roof onto his body.  The man carves harder as the synthesizers grow intense.  He frees himself... or just his hand.  Maybe the rest of his body will be free too.  Okay the man is free.  He puts on his professor glasses and finds himself in the woods.

A nice pretty song as we wind down.  Another man wakes up in a room. A bunch of other people wake up as well.  They all roam around the woods looking up.  The movie closes showing a man in a picture.  If only this man saw what we all saw, he'd be happy he lives in a picture!

This movie is one of the greatest comedies ever.  The first 25 minutes were really intense and graphic, but after that the writing goes in a dramatically different, much funnier direction where nothing makes a lick of sense, but remember it's not supposed to.  Highly recommended!",1500595200,,10395,4.3192927717108685

8640333,4,B00IA7MF8K,"After tearing through V/H/S and V/H/S 2, I started looking for anthology films to review on my site.  Much like books, anthologies offer many different types of entertainment, all crammed into one volume.  Aside from that, I enjoy seeing the variety of perspectives that different directors can bring when presented with a singular concept.  POE: PROJECT OF EVIL takes aim at the works of the legendary author Edgar Allen Poe.  And while I didn't find every piece of this anthology entertaining, the overall film is still enjoyable and certainly worth checking out.

I like Poes works, but I have to confess I like H. P. Lovecraft better.  With that being said, no genre fan can argue Poes influence on modern day on horror.  Like Lovecraft, Poes works are eternal and will be around forever.

While I didn't enjoy every film in this anthology, I have to give major credit to the filmmakers for bringing unique visions of Poes works to the screen.  Each director takes one of Poes stories and gives it a modern-day twist, and for this reason, I really like the film as a whole.

The shorts in POE: PROJECT OF EVIL are all made well, although some look better than others.  I enjoyed The Pit and the Pendulum the most, as its simplistic style was monumental in conveying the emotion being displayed onscreen.  Likewise, Alone looked great and was deliciously gory.  On the opposite end, I did not enjoy Breathless at all, primarily because of the non-spoken interactions that the audience has to read onscreen.

Still, this anthology is definitely one to check out, especially if you are an aspiring filmmaker yourself.  The gems in this collection stand out like lighthouses in the fog, while the others simply sort of fade away.  This is not to discredit the quality of work put out by each filmmaker; this is just my way of saying I didn't like their takes on these particular stories.

I give POE: PROJECT OF EVIL a thumbs up and recommend it to fans of horror and/or fans of Poes works.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1401235200,,2042,4.688202247191011
