2470372,5,B000CR1WSA,"Awesome DVD. Goes into great detail. I enjoyed it greatly. Anyone thinking of doing their own engine work, I would recommend you get this DVD for sure.",1354492800,,151,4.62962962962963
2470373,4,B000CR1WSA,"I enjoyed watching this video. It covered a lot of material with few errors. About the only things I was concerned with was the amount of left over red chemicals shown after application. Maybe it wouldn't cause any problems, just not what I expected to see in a video presentation. When applying new engine case sealant it left me wondering if there yould be an oil leak since the sealant wasn't really applied very well. Minor things really but otherwise I really enjoyed the presentation. I watched it late at night and fell asleep a few times so I need to go back and re-watch it to see if I'm just being overly critical about nothing.

Edit: Aug 2014.
Watched it again and the red chemical looks to be an assembly lube of some kind. Wish I could find more training videos like this. I want to build a 124 or 131 and it would help out a lot. I enjoyed the ""B"" model build up since I purchased a 2007 Softail Custom in August 2013. The crank gear for the balancers has me concerned so I think I'll go with the S&S crank assy. Forum reports seem to indicate that welding the gear to the shaft could make the chain become the weakest link (no pun intended) and could cause further damage. Thought about building the engine without the balancer system but that creates a whole new set of problems since the engine is solid mount. Much to learn but this video helps.",1349049600,3,1364,4.3700787401574805

8100843,4,B000CR1WSA,"Enough info to get it done if you are a good mechanic but should have been a little more specific on some of the difference ways of going about things instead of selling tools that you may or my not need.  This is a Jims tool selling video with enough info to try to convince you that you need to buy his tools.  Don't believe me watch it.  Some more info on why you have to do the task the way you do it would be nice, to short on description, he need to realize that we don't do this every day.  Thanks for asking.  bottom line I am glad I bought it but I still need more info to put this engine together. its not everything but its worth 15 bucks I guess.",1434585600,2,658,3.8805970149253732
