8455210,2,B000OCY7M6,"This is an African-American attempt to do an indie style film where the characters are introduced then it shows their lives intermingle.
The characters:

Jackson Jones -(Guy A. Fortt) A police officer who has his own rules.

Charles Pierce (Travis Johnson) He is Jackson Jones' partner and is disturbed by Jackson crossing the line.

Giovanni (Joey Napoli) He is a garbage collector who hangs out with friends who are criminals. He is concerned about his girlfriend Genesis (Kerrilee Kaski) who teaches at an all black school.

Botelli- Career ad exec who is educated and has a thug boyfriend who beats on her.

Cali- Owns an art gallery which fronts for a massage parlor.

Soul Walker- Drug Counselor.

JR (Hemmer Pascal)- Unlikeable record producer whose girlfriend is Brianna (Nema Kamar).

Vivian (Carol Carhuayano) character introduced as an after thought. She is a paralegal who also has a thug boyfriend.

The film then attempts to tie these stories together in what is called ""Final City."" It jumps around quite a bit and never really brings it home with a climax. Dialogue is bad and the characters we don't get know.

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, N-word, sex, no nudity.",1345939200,,1175,4.97948717948718

He's a charmer, weilding his acting talent as as a samurai would hold his sword, with self-assuredness and precision in each and every scene. He possesses an unmatched ability to set the scene with his on camera presence....to entice you with his words in every clip...J.R. keeps you watching, waiting, wondering what will happen next...J.R. has an ability to hypnotize you with a unsurpassed display of emotions as he moves from anger to laughter to power hungry record mogul that just compels you to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Hate the game is a must see for anyone seeking to know the secrets of what drama truly is.",1290902400,,697,4.768595041322314
8455212,5,B000OCY7M6,"This is a top notch movie. The underdog J.R. was unsurpassed in his acting ability. His acting made you feel a part of the movie. Those 88 minutes went by too quickly.  What can we say, J.R's punching scene? The death sequence? My review could never do any justice than those who have actually seen this movie. And then there's the inevitable water/pool scene. This is definitely a 5 star movie. If anyone reading this knows how I can get the soundtrack please advise.",1290643200,,468,4.571428571428571
