4120865,5,B003G4CWQM,I found All of these movies simply wonderful.  I strongly disagree with the idea that the final story is out of character.  I found it a wonderful version of grown up Anne and Gilbert.  I cried through it all!!,1329350400,6,210,4.333333333333333

We will enjoy this set for many years to come.  I would recomend this DVD set to anyone who enjoys romance, beautiful country/beach scenery, scandle and a dreamer with romantic ideals that seem impossible.  Have fun and enjoy.",1325376000,7,360,4.546875

4120870,2,B003G4CWQM,"The classics written by L. Montgomery are wonderful and at that time the director, Kevin Sullivan seemed to understand the characters and it translated in the films BUT I GIVE HIM A HUGE 'F' FOR THE FOLLOW ON MOVIES/SCRIPTS THAT HE WROTE.  The choices he has Anne and Gilbert make are COMPLETELY out of character for them...I mean come on, they wanted to both be in Avonlea and he had them sell the house, let it go to a pigsty with trashy tenants, and they moved to NY where they did nothing even remotely similar to their character's foundation and beliefs.  Just horrible.  Don't buy this full set, but the first two by L. Montgomery only. So disappointing.",1311206400,63,660,4.576271186440678

4120872,3,B003G4CWQM,First problem was my Panasonic player could not turn off the subtitle. So I had to find a second machine to display it. With my Samsung I could turn the subtitle off. I have never ever expeireinced this type of problem before. The film quality is grainy also. I do not think it is my machine. And the Panisonic sound quality was better. But the Kevin Sullivan version is what my daughter and I enjoyed many years ago. I would have given more stars if I could figure out how to remove the subtiltes. This is art at its best though. The world needs more of both art and compassion.,1511913600,,579,4.2727272727272725

4120877,4,B003G4CWQM,"I had the Closed Captioned version for several years: however, since we purchased a new 55"" Hisense flatscreen TV, it was not Closed Captioned friendly. i came across this new version which included subtitles and quickly bought it. I'm happy with it! now my wife and i who are deaf, can enjoy watching this remarkable Anne of green  Gables miniseries!
UPDATE....UPDATE....UPDATE: My wife and I watched the first three movies for the first time with this new set. The subtitles are fine; however, the Anne Of Green Gables A New Beginning was not subtitled which was a huge disappointment. Upon purchasing it almost a year ago, we were led to believe that ALL of these movies were subtitled. This is a deception and we are requesting at least 1/4 of our money back. Shame on you!",1504137600,3,777,4.713235294117647

4120884,5,B003G4CWQM,"It's with great rarity that I write Amazon reviews. However, I love me some AoGG and there seems to be some confusion as to which Anne boxed set is the best available. Hopefully this will provide some clarity.

This review is for the 8-disc DVD set clearly labeled with ""the Kevin Sullivan Restoration"" and signature on the packaging. It includes all 4 of Mr. Sullivan's ""Anne"" films as well as a nice amount of newly produced bonus material and documentaries. The first three films/mini-series have been painstakingly restored from the original 16mm negatives and look absolutely lovely. Previous DVD releases were sourced from fairly high quality tape masters but these new disc are a revelation in clarity, detail, and color that make watching on an HDTV an absolute joy. Any review saying these films are not restored and remastered is absolutely mistaken. It's possible some might have ordered the wrong product or may not have their home entertainment system properly connected. I viewed these with a Sony blu-ray player which is connected to my HDTV via an HDMI cable. This provides practically perfect picture and sound depending on the native quality of the video source.

Anyway. I can't recommend this set enough for fans of Kevin Sullivan's Anne adaptations. The first two mini series are wonderful examples of timeless perfection that I look forward to visiting over and over again. The ample and informative bonus features and HD remastering alone make this worth the purchase or upgrade from previous releases. The packaging is beautiful and the glossy souvenir book is a nice inclusion. My only quibble is that as lovely as these films look on DVD, it would be nice if a blu-ray edition was available as well. As of this writing only the first Anne of Green Gables series is available to purchase on individual blu-ray, but hopefully a ""Anne of Avonlea"" or true HD boxed set is coming soon! Until then, this edition is the way to go. Pick it up if you can- you'll be glad you did!",1497484800,79,1996,4.850439882697947
4120885,5,B003G4CWQM,"If you loved the books, you will love these movies! This collection of movies is the old classics, but without the grainy picture in the older DVD set. It includes the trilogy plus a fourth movie. The trilogy is amazing, and you will want to watch these again and again! The extra movie is not as good as the others, so I wouldn't buy it just for that.",1492646400,3,352,4.1911764705882355
4120886,5,B003G4CWQM,I have been happily enjoying watching this since I got it. I watched it back when it was on pbs when I was a girl and this is one of my favorite book series I read growing up. The only thing I don't care for on this set is how the dvd's are held in the case. They are tricky to get in and out and if you aren't careful could scratch the discs. Still love this though. Well worth buying . If you are an Anne of Green Gables fan check out the newer version also available (think it's one of the Sheens as Mathew). This version is still the best.,1490400000,2,543,3.857142857142857
4120887,5,B003G4CWQM,"I was tickled to get this beloved miniseries in DVD format to share with my little girls, for I only had the VHS versions up until now, and as everyone knows, VHS is pretty much phased out (not to mention the quality is appallingly grainy compared to updated DVD, bluray, etc). The remastered versions of the first two original movies (Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Green Gables: The sequel (or Anne of Avonlea as I grew up knowing it) were of slightly better quality than my VHS tapes, but still not to the caliber of most recent DVD qualities. But in their defense, there's only so much one can do to dated films to remaster them, and I was still happy I purchased them. Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story and Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning were made later than the original two Anne's so they were already of higher quality. All in all, I'm satisfied with the purchase and loved seeing the joy on my girls' faces when they watched for the first time these wonderful films about spunky redheaded Anne. My heart soared with delight when they wanted to watch them all over again.",1487894400,8,1097,4.462686567164179

This was made to be viewed on the old square box TVs, not today's gigantic, wide, flat screens so there is only so much that can be done to make it compatible with today's HD home theaters.  Sometimes it is a little pixilated on my 42"" flatscreen but knowing when it was filmed and the original format, I understand and am just happy to have this wonderful set. I imagine it may be a bit more blurry when viewed on larger flatscreen, but that is just a guess.  Overall, this makes me happy!",1470614400,5,498,4.276595744680851

4120913,5,B003G4CWQM,"I am very happy with the quality of this product. I love these movies and have done so since I was a little girl and I watched them on taped from TV VHS with my Grandmother. Now that was bad quality. I have seen that there are some negative comments on here, stating that the quality was not as advertised, but I don't agree at all. You can tell that a lot of work went into restoring these movies and I think that as a customer you need to take into account when these movies were made, how they were made and the level of technology that is available in order to restore them. Yes, technology is amazing, but even with all the advances we have made there still must be allowances. I am very happy that the time was taken to do these restorations at all. I have seen on the Sullivan Facebook page that there is going to be a Blu-ray of the first movie released in about two weeks. The level of restoration promises to be higher than what is seen on these DVDs. I would suggest that if you are disappointed in the DVD restoration you give the Blu-ray a chance. I plan on purchasing it for my Grandmother and I am very much looking forward to reliving this amazing story again with her.",1445817600,5,1185,4.201754385964913

4120923,5,B003G4CWQM,"I looked for this set for a long time because I wanted something with image quality. From what I understand, extensive work had to be done to these films because they were originally made for television.

4120924,1,B003G4CWQM,"There is no such thing as a true, real, widescreen version of these original Anne Of Green Gables movies since the Original Master Source of these films aspect ratio was filmed in 1.33:1 (also called 4:3) ..and you can not create from that source what is Not There in the first place!

What Sullivan did to call it widescreen (really misleading therefore dishonest) is that they zoomed in and cropped from the original 4:3 format, and what happens when you crop and zoom to 'unnaturally' make it bigger - in order to do that!..the tops and sides portions of all the scenes of the original movie have to get cut off in the process!..and so you lose 20%+ of the peripheral scene information. As well this fakefully unnatural 'zooming in' on the original creates artifacts in the copy they make - and they want to call it widescreen - not a chance that it truly is though! Technically it fills 16x9 yes, but in reality to the source...NO! They Faked it! This is atrocious that they are pushing this as HD let alone a Widescreen version - don't buy it.
Get the the original copies just as it was first recorded to film in the original 1.33:1 format, as is, as it was original, which is all the source ever was in the first place; sure it was older technology back then we know that, but the source format is as as good as you are going to get anyway and you can not create what is not there in the first place, and importantly has no cut off sides and tops just to call it widescreen... no thanks!

To get the 3 Anne movies in the best original presentation, I bought them individually, for $15 each, at the links below.  I wanted to be sure I was getting the best original recordings caring greatly about all the quality points made, and these 3 below have that. I've left out other info about various overseas market releases of these Anne Of Green Gables movies for brevity sake (including some DVD9 DL releases) but covered the basics here since there are so many different versions!  Don't be mislead and buy any of these so-called HD Widescreen versions if you care about what has been discussed.

Here are the original 3 movies by them, original aspect Ratio 4:3 1.33:1, NTFS, from Amazon
These first 3 links given below are the ones to get.
They did enhance the color a wee bit, which is fine and did a good job of that.
(as of todays date, these Amazon links below are correct)

First movie called just:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-Green-Gables/dp/B00005YNTR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of Green Gables</a>
&
Second movie made a few years later called:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-Of-Green-Gables-The-Sequel/dp/B00005Y7AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne Of Green Gables - The Sequel</a>
&
Third movie made years later called:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-Of-Green-Gables-The-Continuing-Story/dp/B00005Y7AM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne Of Green Gables - The Continuing Story</a>
...this last one revolves around later as she grew up, and even volunteered with Red Cross to serve in the war ...it's great too, but imho not quite the same innocent vibe as the first two, but still a great watch. Nothing can beat the first two though imho.

DVD5 double sided, not DL, and so yes since the movies are so long you have to flip the discs to view the other half of the movie.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As for the movies themselves, Yes, They Are Excellent! ..we all know that already and there's no question about that.
My 1 star rating of this particular release is not about the movies themselves, but about the technicality of how they falsely re-create the widesceen format and in the process create unacceptable limitations, on this particular wide-screen version linked here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-Green-Gables-Remastered-Complete-Coll/dp/B006ZUMNGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of Green Gables-Remastered Complete Coll</a>
PS,
Also here's yet another so-called widescreen version with the same limitations to stay away from, here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-Green-Gables-The-Sequel/dp/B00543QGEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel</a>&nbsp;(they show in the green outlined box)

We took the DVDs we created, zoomed them in twice and got the EXACT picture this ""restored"" version has.....grainy picture! This is false advertising at best! Shame on Kevin Sullivan!!!

The company who remastered this worked very hard and to get this in HD and the way they show how its done is amazing. The extras are more amazing! They show Marilla's funeral which was talked about in Season 4 Road to Avonlea, with a special appearance by Jonathan Crombie. Like I said, please watch the video preview on their webiste. I'll be purchasing this complete season on their website since its $20 cheaper. And more extras added as well.

As well to purchase is Wind at my Back and Road to Avonlea...both seasons are well worth it at their website and more affordable.

4120962,4,B003G4CWQM,"First of all, let me start this review by giving some background.  I am by no means the Anne of Green Gables fan that my wife is.  She absolutely loves the Lucy Maud Montgomery novels and the first two movies (which are true to the original stories penned by Montgomery around the turn of the century).  We honeymooned in Prince Edward Island and can say with certainty that Sullivan's films capture the island (and parts of the Toronto area...but that's a whole different story) beautifully.

I hesitated before purchasing this boxed set for my wife, since we already owned the trilogy.  The prospect of cleaned up prints, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround remixing, and so forth interested me (since I'm more of the geek when it comes to these sorts of things).

After watching the first two films, knowing what the state the masters were in, and understanding that the goal was to provide a widescreen presentation of the films, I must say that I am quite pleased with the result.

Some of the comments I've read are completely misinformed.  I highly recommend you check out the Sullivan Entertainment website (See: [...]) for information on the process that was employed to edit and refine these films.  My wife has watched these films so many times that she was able to pick out where B-roll was employed, since she could tell difference in inflection and wording of dialog in a few spots.  This definitely isn't the hack-job that I was afraid it might be given the ridiculously ill-informed reviews I had read.

If you already own these, I wouldn't say rush out and buy this.  There is still a graininess to the first two films (can't speak for the 3rd, though I don't care much since it wasn't even based on the novels) which can be attributed to the state of the original medium.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix isn't the greatest I've ever heard, but it does give depth to what would otherwise be a stereo presentation.  I rather liked it.  This isn't an action flick, so I don't expect to be overtaken by the audio.

If you don't own it, this would be a great way to purchase the trilogy all at once.  The fourth film (the prequel) starring Barbara Hershey wasn't too bad, and was only aired in Canada as far as I know.  The third film, well, what can be said other than that it was completely written out of thin air.  It might have the characters that L.M. Montgomery created in it, but she never wrote the story that it's based on.

It isn't the greatest remaster in the world, but it certainly isn't the worst.  I think you get your money's worth here.",1359936000,75,2554,4.544857768052516
4120963,5,B003G4CWQM,I ordered this collection for my daughter for Christmas.  Very prompt shipping and product was as described.  I would definately order again from Megan Follows!,1359417600,2,160,5.36
4120964,5,B003G4CWQM,"Grew up watching this movie series on VHS and loved receiving it now on DVD.  They will continue to get lots of use, and Megan Follows is the best Anne of all time.  This is such a wonderful series for girls to grow up watching because it teaches lessons about love, forgiveness, telling the truth, importance of family and faith, and overcoming all situations with a hopeful spirit.  I highly recommend this DVD collection to anyone that loves to laugh and enjoy a good movie watching a kindred spirit grow into something beautiful.",1356652800,4,533,4.709677419354839

4120968,2,B003G4CWQM,"I love the first two Anne of Green Gables films. I first viewed them on PBS and had the original VHS tapes released by Disney. The first few DVD releases by Sullivan were of very poor audio and visual quality. This new - expensive - set gathers the four films together, all in 16x9 widescreen. I do not like the other two films, so I will comment only on the first two.

These were originally filmed in 4x3 format, with television in mind (I read that they may have played theatrically overseas). I'm not an expert, but these new widescreen formats do look cropped. So, information is lost with these new transfers. Is that so bad? Yes, because I feel the original aspect ratios of these films should be 4x3 (or 1.33:1) as they were originally broadcasted. Worse though, the image quality seems to be so digitally scrubbed that a lot of detail that was originally visible is no longer visible. The audio seems OK; the default is the original 2.0 stereo mix. Annoyingly, the closed captioning seems to have been done by nitwits. For the first film, the first disc (thankfully, each movie has two discs) has fairly good captioning. The second disc has the captioning all IN FULL CAPS, and is rife with errors. Very poor quality!! At this price point, I would not recommend fans to rebuy these films if they are already owned. However, as an FYI, I contacted Sullivan Entertainment and they said they have no plans to release the films on blu-ray.",1345852800,95,1444,4.596899224806202

4120971,5,B003G4CWQM,"Contrary to popular opinion, I actually love every single Anne of Green Gables production. In my opinion, some of Megan Fellows' and Jonthan Crombies' finest acting are in the final series not covered in the books. I feel that Kevin Sullivan actually rose to the occasion of capturing audience interest, while keeping the story real and pertinent to the World War I times. Who knows what Lucy Maud Montgomery might have produced if the modern movie technology had been available in her time? Also, it is entirely realistic for characters to actually try on another hat for size (move to another locale, try their hand at a different occupation, etc.), as most young people of today do, even though they may return to their home roots. I am thankful for people like Kevin Sullivan who recognize the need for excellent movie material with excellent actors/actresses without all the smut of today's modern movies! Kevin could still go on and make more productions covering the period after Anne and Gilbert return, thus returning to the story as Lucy wrote.",1336521600,11,1054,4.926966292134831
